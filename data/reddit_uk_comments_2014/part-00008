true,no_the_other_guy,tennant,Tennant,"I apologize for how long this is in advance, these are just all my reasons. Just skip to the TLDR if you don't want to read all of it. 

I agree that every Doctor had bad moments and good moments. Maybe it was because he was my first Doctor, but I prefer David Tennant over Matt Smith. 
While I think they are both talented actors, I feel as though Ten had a more likeable personality than Eleven, IMO. I liked that he had so many emotion filled moments. Which yes, Smith had some too. The only really powerful one I can think of is Amy and Rory dying, and his regeneration. He did have more speeches, I will give him that. But Ten had his regeneration explanation to Wilf, and that one was pretty good. And I  feel as though Eleven was very quirky and upbeat in his early seasons, and all of a sudden he started getting darker and darker, and he seemed really changed which was weird. 

Another thing was how often Ten tried to save as many people as he could. And even if he didn't save them he tried his hardest, I can't really think of any times where Eleven had that attitude. Sure, he would end up saving people(exception for his regeneration episode because he stayed in Christmas for a long time) but Ten would often be bent on saving at least someone in some form because too many people were dying. 

Also, Ten had more companions than Eleven, even though they were on for about the same amounts of time(maybe Eleven had one more season?) Ten had Rose and Mickey, Donna, and Martha and several other recurring characters I'm not sure if you would count as companions (like Jack). Eleven only had Amy and Rory, and Clara. 

The last thing is that I kind of feel like he ruined Ten's regeneration. Saying goodbye to each of his companions(with the exception of Donna, but seeing her on wedding day) and when he finally gets to Rose, and it's before she even met Nine, so she thinks he's just some guy who's probably a little drunk. That started my emotions because while I did not cry when Rose got sent to the parallel universe, it was his first companion and they ended up loving each other (or, it is implied that. It's definite Rose loved him) and all he can tell her is that she is going to have a great year. 
Next he enters the TARDIS, and his amazing portrayal of the physical and emotional pain coupled with the powerful music brought tears to my eyes. But it isn't until he says his last line that I start to really bawl- 
""I don't want to go.""
This is tragic in itself because his attitude was always based on his catchphrase, allon-sy, because he was always adventurous and willing to keep going on. But when his time to come to an end has arrived, he can't bear it and regenerates in a fiery release of the energy. 
*Annnnnd cue Matt Smith*
Now here I am, crying pretty bad, when all of a sudden the new Doctor appears and the mood COMPLETELY changes. It's no longer dramatic, but becomes more like early Eleven's personality-super upbeat and rushed and quirky- and I did not appreciate this drastic mood change. And it kind of ruined it for me. I still cry if I watch The End of Time 1/2, but I just feel unsatisfied watching Eleven's first moments in the show.  



TL;DR: I also like Tennant's era much better than Smith's. I liked Tennant's personality, companions, and powerful emotional moments better. Tennant's regeneration was way more powerful IMO and made me cry, Smith's did not. I am not saying I dislike Smith, but I like Tennant better and agree with OP.

Fuck Steven Moffat. He made me cry when Rose was stranded in the parallel universe and he made me cry when Amy and Rory created a paradox and then again when they got sent back in time.

Overall, RTD standard episodes usually get an emotional response from me while I burn through Moffat Episodes until I encounter a cliffhanger or a Companion is in peril. Then I have an emotional response.

Honestly, I'm still not really into Matt Smith's Doctor. His mannerisms and attitude is so much different than ever before. Not to mention he's been killing people now and letting others die. It's as if he doesn't care. He's not the Doctor anymore. He's just a madman with a box who is finally realizing that he needs to take his adventures more seriously and be far more careful with his companions. What bothers me is that it took nearly his entire run to realize this.

With Tenth, he was having a great time but he was serious about his ""job"" and his companions were changed by him but technically for the better.

Regardless of my opinion on Eleventh, Matt Smith does a terrific job and does the role justice. I'm glad he was selected to play the Eleventh incarnation. I still prefer Tennant and Eccleston.

Another option could be to write risk assessments yourself for a couple of the more minor hazards you perceive, then take these to your manager and tell them how great you are, how pro-active you've been and aren't you clever, and now you need help in completing some of the other risk assessments in order to help the store compile a comprehensive safety document. That will let your company know the issue and I would have thought it pretty difficult for them to punish you for doing something that is of clear benefit to the company.

true,hamlet9000,mcgann,McGann,"I would strongly disagree with you.

First, I feel that when the quality dipped under RTD it dipped down to a level of mediocrity. When the quality dips under Moffat, OTOH, it dips to being incredibly bad. (I'm excluding the 2008-2010 specials here, which were all fairly dreadful.) There is absolutely nothing in RTD's tenure which is anywhere near as bad as ""The Crimson Horror"", ""Curse of the Black Spot"", ""Victory of the Daleks"", or ""Vampires of Venice"".

Second, while both RTD and Moffat have a tendency to wrap up their season finales in a horrid mess of deus ex machina, RTD at least had the decency to give us *different* deus ex machinae. In the four major finales of Moffat's tenure (S5, S6, S7, and ""The Time of the Doctor"") three have featured a message beamed ""throughout time and space""; three of them have featured the Doctor screaming up at orbiting spaceships that they're too afraid of him to come down; and three have featured pocket/alternate universes created as the result of someone trying to assassinate the Doctor.

If we're talking about the *heights* of each tenure, I think it's pretty much an even draw. (Well, until you hit S7 which was completely horrid except for ""Asylum of the Daleks"".) But from 2005 to 2008, I tuned into *Doctor Who* each week expecting great television. Since 2008 (and this is almost entirely on Moffat's shoulders), the massive inconsistency of the series means that I'm only *hoping* that I'll be entertained (and that hope faded pretty severely during S7).

Let me put it another way: There was never a single point during RTD's tenure when I thought to myself, ""I'm probably going to stop watching this show."" I've reached that point with Moffat: The first episode of S7 was mediocre. The rest of the season was *dire*. The finale was terrible. And ""The Time of the Doctor"" was a perfect encapsulation of everything wrong with Moffat's writing right now. If it wasn't for *Day of the Doctor* being excellent and Peter Capaldi coming onboard, I'd have already called it quits.",1,1389253489,null,0,false,0,cel5r8h,t3_1ursgv,t1_cel5r8h,t3_1ursgv,null,1431865581,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

2) RTD's deus ex's machina's didn't even make sense.  Jesus Doctor?  What?  At least Moffat's had a bit of an *oh shit that's cool* factor.  Tell me you didn't get that when John Hurt was introduced.  Tell me you didn't get that when the ultimate question was revealed.  Russell T Davies had no moments in his finales that got a reaction out of me.  All I thought was ""What plot point briefly mentioned earlier in the season's going to pop out it's head to save the doctor now?""  Whilst Moffat's finale actually had mysteries I couldn't wait to be unveiled because it was more than just a means of getting the Doctor out of the situation he was in.  It was something important to the character's entire history.  There is no way RTD's finales are less shitty than Moffat's.

3) Funny, I am the exact reverse.  While watching RTD era I wasn't sure if it was going to be a good episode or not, but with Moffat I knew I was in for some entertainment.

I have always fitted them and left them on all the time as the actual pump solenoid should be activated by the drop in w/pressure when you turn the taps on.

What I would do in your situation... Use it by switching on and off till a time when your in all day (w/end?) - then switch it on and see what happens.  Check it periodically and see if it gets hot when not in use (it shouldn't) Also get someone else to have a shower with it on and see how hot it gets. It should only get as hot as the water running through it which is about (I guess) 60deg.  You can also check your fuse box to make sure the breaker is the right sort for the pump or if old style that no one has put a bit of tin foil in there in the past.   Also if its in the loft - move anything flammable you can a good distance away from it 

My gut feeling is that it will heat up when in use and then at some point fail - which will result in lots of smoke and maybe melted plastic as it seizes up.  At this point it will trip the breaker, start to cool down again and need replacing.  I also think that its unlikely to cause a big fire as if it burns as it takes quite a lot of heat build up to hit an ignition point - also the pipe work will disconnect as the fittings go and water will come out and cool things down.  This will may put the fire out for you but will cause a flood.

true,DireDireDuck,flair8,,"Would be a very solid addition that I would love, but may be unlikely seeing as Wolfsburg is close to a Champions League spot themselves, and if they do sell, there are rumors of bigger clubs sniffing around him as well. 

For starters [whoscored is high on him](http://www.whoscored.com/Players/61610), as he only trails Ribery in [highest average match rating](http://www.whoscored.com/Regions/81/Tournaments/3/Seasons/3863/Stages/7806/PlayerStatistics/Germany-Bundesliga-2013-2014) in the Bundesliga this year. For the unfamiliar, whoscored uses raw statistics from Opta in a series of algorithims to determine their match rating; typically good events are weighed against bad events. 

Regardless if you think Rose is suitable for a team with Champions League ambitions, Ricardo Rodriguez is, on paper, the better player. Warning: tables below. 

Comparing the two in a few passing statistics throughout their current league year:

Statistic | Danny Rose | Ricardo Rodriguez
:--|:--:|:--:|
Completion % | **82.8** | 78.7
Key Passes/Game | 1.1 | **1.9**
Comp. Crosses/Game | 1.4 | **1.9**
Comp. Long Balls/Game | 2.7 | **4.9**

What we can gather from that is that Rodriguez takes more risks with his passes than Rose does, but creates many more opportunities than Rose. This can be a double-edged sword as we know Vlad (our typical LCB) likes to frequently make runs up the pitch. A mistimed pass leaves us very vulnerable to the counter. This can be avoided assuming Jan is back to LCB. For those who were bemoaning AVB's safe possession-based system, Rodriguez seems like a prototypical Sherwood LB.

Now, here's a table comparing the two in some defensive statistics throughout their league year so far:


Statistic | Danny Rose | Ricardo Rodriguez
:--|:--:|:--:|
Aerial Duels Won/Game | 1.3 | **2.8**
Tackles/Game | 2.0 | **3.1**
Interceptions/Game | 1.7 | **1.9**
Clearances/Game | **3.9** | 3.3
Fouls/Game | 1.3 | **1.0**

Again this favors Rodriguez. In an ideal world you would want to have as few clearances as possible. Rose's lead suggests Tottenham's defense bends more than Wolfsburg's. A valid argument can be said that the Bundesliga is not as talented as a whole compared to the Premier League, so here are Rodriguez's match ratings vs. German teams that qualified for European competitions. For reference, Rose has averaged a 7.27 rating in his seven Prem appearances:

Team | Result | Rating | Notes
:-- | :--: | :--: | :--:
Schalke 04 | W 4-0 | 8.31 | n/a
Bayer Leverkusen | L 3-1 | 7.63 | [Assist](http://youtu.be/EEhmPpakTEc)
Bayern Munich | L 1-0 | 7.27 | n/a
Eintracht Frankfurt | W 1-2 | 8.13 | n/a
Borussia Dortmund | W 2-1 | 8.50 | MotM/[Goal](http://youtu.be/h0D09SjXzsE)
SC Freiburg | W 0-3 | 8.38 | n/a
VfB Stuttgart | W 3-1 | 9.12 | MotM/[Goal](http://youtu.be/B6_atbHGMmg)

While you could argue that the two goals he scored were soft, there's no argument that those two balls were put in to very dangerous areas from spots not often considered very dangerous. Statistics aren't the end-all-be-all of how we should rate players, but they can give us a good idea. In this case we get a good idea that on his worst day against arguably the strongest team in the world, Rodriguez had roughly the same game Danny Rose has averaged @Palace, v.Swansea, @Arse, @Soton, v. West Brom, and @United.

In my opinion, he'd be an upgrade to our team and our chances this year. Here's [a highlight video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIHe9by9tFA) of his current season that goes up to the game before the VfB Stuttgart fixture (like statistics, this doesn't tell the whole story of a player, but a 2:30 highlight reel for a LB (sans fluff and replays) is impressive). Grabbing a player outside of the Premier League may raise concerns about him settling in in enough time to make a difference on our season, however Rodriguez grew up in Zurich where the common language is a Swiss dialect of German meaning Holtby can help him accommodate himself. Additionally nearly 10% of Zurich citizens speak English* and another five percent speak French*, opening the door of him being able to communicate with Sherwood about tactics and Lloris about positioning (I have not been able to find interviews of Ricardo Rodriguez speaking English or French, only German. I'm just pointing this out to show there is a possibility that he could integrate himself faster than skeptics think).

true,jwbensley,null,null,"Hi Haybro, as others have mentioned and as is mentioned in the job advert, the salary is dependant on the applicant. I currently work as an Network Engineer for the same company (which is why I posted the job advert!) so I can tell you it is a good fair wage, what I would consider the industry average of someone of my skill set and experiance. There are other engineers here more skilled than me and they get paid more, there are others less skilled and they get paid less. Its just as you would expect.

I often see people complaining about there being no salary range on a job advert (although I wouldn't really say you are complaining above, more ""enquiring"") - I just don't see how it's a big deal, at all really? It takes 10 minutes to apply for a job. No one is going to accept a job without asking or negotiating a salar first so you're not going to find your self in a situation where you've moved across the country, started a new job, then waited 1 month for your first pay packet to arrive, only to then find out you can't afford the rent on your new home! How would such a scenario arise unless you were completely fecking stupid, in which case we wouldn't hire you!

Application time is 10 minutes maybe, if the potential employer likes your CV and/or cover letter and ask for an interview you can ask then or enquire via email in advance. Easy as that.

Also I would like to add that money really is only 50% of the deal for me, as an employee. If you love your job you will work for much less. At a previous employer I was earning around 5k less than the average but the company was a charity so I expected a lower wage and I loved the job, I actually loved getting up in the morning for it. Also the staff were great. We were a really close bunch.

For anyone interested in this current job posting, the working atmosphere is the best I've ever experianced, I simply love it. We have so many good laughs and jokes.

The main QPR pubs are:

* Queen Adelaide: Nice selection of beers.

* The Crown &amp; Sceptre: Nice place, very little room as game time approaches. I often go here.

* The Springbok (QPR fans only - show your ticket at the door): Spit and bullets - My Taekwondo teacher insists I take him here when I smuggle him into Loftus road for Liverpool games. I often go here.

* Coningham Arms

* The British Queen

* The White Horse (QPR fans only - show your ticket at the door): I like this one. I often go here.

* Defective Weld  (QPR fans only - show your ticket at the door). Have been here a few times socially but not before a game - look out for the hipsters.

* The Green (QPR fans only - show your ticket at the door). Chilled atmosphere with plenty of natural light.

Without going into detail, let's just say that I have had a few years of experience/exposure in this area but I don't gamble. ;)

The games are VERY cleverly crafted. They use lots of subtle psychological tactics to get you hooked and keep you playing. The game makers hire PhDs in psychology and mathematics/statistics to design the games.

See [Escalation of commitment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation_of_commitment), now think about those adverts on television for online gambling where they offer you a free ¬£10 to start. You spend your ¬£10, you probably lose your ¬£10, what are you going to do next? Maybe spend another few pounds in the hope of winning back that initial ¬£10 ... it really is a slippery slope.


They pay very close attention to the colours, sounds, layout and game style for every single place that they put those machines. i.e. jurisdictions.

E.g. machines destined for Chinese players will feature lots of ""lucky"" symbols and colours. Everything about the design will read ""good fortune"" to your typical [Chinese gambler](http://www.betsir.com/gambling-asian-culture.html).

Many games are exactly the same game but they change the graphics depending on the jurisdiction and the target market.

I heard of one story of a game that no-one would play in one Asian jurisdiction. Problem? The picture of the dragon on the machine had the wrong number of toes!

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_dragon#Dragon_toes

I kid you not. This stuff is an art as much as it is science. The machines are a highly-polished automated conman. If someone of lower intellect, or with a tendency to gamble, encounters the machine then they are at a disadvantage.

EDIT:

I've been in a pub at 6:30am to watch the installation of a machine. In the pub was a guy in tracksuit pants with his credit cards stuck in the PLAY button of three machines at once. He was letting the reels spin continuously while waiting for his big win. Every now and then he would go back to the cashier and withdraw another wad of cash. Not sure how much, but I could see $50 (¬£30) notes being handed out. His mates were there with him but they weren't playing.

On another machine was a business woman, dressed in a nice three piece suit, playing away. For what? she obviously had a respectable job to go to.

6:30 in the morning. It was sad. What's a pub doing open at 6:30am though? They're only open for the people who play those machines.",0,1389260577,null,0,1389268534,0,cel73z5,t3_1upc5n,t1_cel73z5,t3_1upc5n,null,1431866193,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Add to that, even the myth of shareholder control of public companies is just that, a myth - in fact a small band of directors and a small clutch of large scale major shareholders hold all the strings, and with the levels of cross ownership and mutual back-scratching this runs right cross the economy and dominates political as well.

I say this because look at what the Guardian did by comparison:

Notice already in the URL we've got a reference to the party.  In the title, the sub-title, the first word of the body.

Compare that to the Torygraph:

* http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5364831/MPs-expenses-Sir-Peter-Viggers-in-duck-house-mystery.html

No mention in title, the body starts with his full title, constituency and party.

Let's go look at a worse offender.

* http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/dec/23/denis-macshane-jailed-bogus-expenses

Oh, no mention of party in that URL is there, nothing in the title, aha first word of the sub-title.  In fact it is very similar to the torygraph coverage of Viggers.

- We need to be buying someone who is first team quality and is worth investing money in to, and is going to be written down on the team sheet ahead of Rose

-  Needs to be a definite improvement, someone who can justify the amount we would pay for them

I feel that it's not necessarily a bad thing that it would be Wolfsburg that we would be dealing with. A team with Champions League aspirations would surely be looking to improve their team as a whole. 

Going off on a bit of a tangent here, what's your opinion of Granit Xhaka? I believe he currently plays for Moenchengladbach(forgive me if I've murdered the spelling), a team that are in a similar posititon to Wolfsburg on the table. As well as him, Xherdan Shaqiri (Bayern Munich), who isn't finding as much gametime as a player of his quality deserves

- Transfermarkt values Shaqiri at 20 mil (Definitely out of our range), and Xhaka at 7.5.

When I got home last night, the worse for wear, I was reminiscing about the great year when I was 14, a kop season ticket holder and punk. Eric‚Äôs was a legendary club in Liverpool, run by the great late Roger Eagle, where all the best punk/ post punk/ reggae bands played. In 1978 they started matinees so the bands playing on Saturday nights would play an extra gig for under 18s. I was in the incredibly fortunate position to see one of the greatest club football sides of all time as well as well as incredible bands during a classic period of musical history.

I used to write down the bands I saw in a gig book which I still have and last night I thought I would cross reference games and bands to see what double bills I had experienced. That Tottenham game was one of the best I‚Äôve seen and when I saw that it was Magazine I‚Äôd seen afterwards I had an urge to post. I never learn that being drunk and posting on Reddit to not mix.

The following week I saw Joy Division for the first time.

Here is another one.  21st October 1978
Liverpool 2 ‚Äì Chelsea 0 (Johnson, Dalglish)
Then on to see [Wire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_%28band%29) (Chairs Missing period).

I cannot help but feel we are at the dawning of another great era for Liverpool Football Club. 2-9-1978 was a good day, 78/79 was a great season.

Reasons to be suspicious - initial lies told by the police that he shot at them, that the gun cant be conclusively linked to duggan, police collusion to collectively write statements and then stonewall the rest of the investigation, the apparent dismisal of evidence from the only non biased witnesses who claimed he had his hands up as well as that the police planted the weapon, the fact the police destroyed evidence (the car) then tried to cover it up, that the police didn't follow procedure repeatedly including not informing the family, that the marksman's account was proved to be false, that the police initially refused to hand over various evidence to the coroner as they are bound to by law and I'm sure there is more. 

To me, it is clear that the police made a mistake in shooting an unarmed man and then have colluded to massage the evidence. This would hardly be a surprise to anyone who is familiar with multiple high profile cases involving the police here and abroad. 

Whether they shot him or not is maybe less of my concern even if I do find it shocking. I am however bewildered that there is no attempt to punish the police when they flagrantly break the rules they are bound by law to follow.

Duggan was a known criminal and gang member who was *known to own a firearm*, who was actually *in possession of the firearm* right up until a few seconds before the incident, and who had been positively identified.

Obviously mistakes can always be made, but that doesn't mean that all mistakes are equal, or that the perpetrator can't be blamed for making one and not another.

So, instead of drawing parallels look at the person that actually was shot.

I think it was ok for the police to shoot a known gangster and drug-dealer who they had under long term investigation and knew had just picked up a gun, probably for use in a shooting. It is certainly believable that the officer who fired could have felt that he or other officers were in danger.

So no it was not ""any person"".

true,BritRedditor1,null,null,"Post 2008 unemployment didn't exactly rise proportionately compared to the decline in GDP. So the theory is firms were hoarding labour with the expectation or uncertainty of a possible recovery. Firms supposedly did this to avoid the cost of rehiring and retraining as well as being ready to meet demand. This is probably the most cited theory. 

www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19981498

Other theories: 
 
&gt; So most British workers are not sitting idle in firms shielding them from the sack. The productivity puzzle is genuine: Britons are working harder to produce less. There are lots of reasons for this, suggests Kevin Daly of Goldman Sachs, many of them temporary. Jobs that involve winning contracts are tough in a slump: estate agents and the like must hunt harder for clients. In such sectors more hours do not necessarily imply more output. In manufacturing firms, production techniques can be adjusted to reflect the fact that labour is cheap but investing in machines is costly. Companies might delay investment and work existing equipment harder by putting on night shifts. Such trends keep employment up and output down. They are fairly easy to reverse as the economy recovers.
&gt; 
&gt; But there is another, far less benign, explanation for the productivity puzzle. In a recent paper Ben Broadbent, a member of the Bank of England‚Äôs Monetary Policy Committee, explains that it takes time for hard-hit sectors to shed labour and capital following a shock. It also takes time for new, fast-growing sectors to mop up these resources. During this period of flux, people and capital are concentrated in declining sectors, and economic output will be less than it could be. And the stickiness is not just between one sector and another. A recent analysis by the ONS of some 50,000 firms revealed huge productivity gaps between companies in the same industry. Reallocating resources to the most productive firms and sectors could give the economy a huge boost.

true,Yaverland,english,London,"Hello, I'm a former political type with experience of bill work.

**Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill 2013-14**

You can find lots of info about this Bill on its [parliament.uk bill page](http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2013-14/antisocialbehaviourcrimeandpolicingbill.html). This shows the stages the Bill passed through and collates many relevant documents.

**What is the argument about?**

The Bill was introduced to the Commons by the Government on 9 May 2013. From the outset, the Bill had a first clause allowing new injunctions to be taken against people causing ""annoyance"". I haven't looked into it too closely but it appears that the government wants to widen the scope of measures to combat anti-social behaviour by creating a new class of civil injunctions, alongside something stronger called Criminal Behaviour Orders. [More info here.](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/251312/01_Factsheet_Replacing_the_ASBO_-_updated_for_Lords.pdf)

The government claims there are many [scare stories](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/06/law-to-stop-eveyone-everything) about how this language will be enforced in practice, but they are responding by introducing many ""safeguards"" (such as [protecting the right to peaceful protest\)](http://www.theguardian.com/law/2013/dec/18/right-to-protest-anti-social-behaviour-crime-policing-bill). 

**How do MPs vote on a Bill?**

There are many stages to a bill and many ways to vote on it ([this page explains more](http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/passage-bill/)). 

There are two houses of Parliament, the Commons and the Lords. When a Bill enters a House, the first vote is after the ""second reading"" debate. The last vote is at ""third reading"". These are votes on the bill as a whole. However, Bills tend to say lots of things at once. A policing bill of some sort gets passed most years and it covers all kinds of topics. This particular Bill includes clauses on firearms, forced marriage,child sexual exploitation, and many other things. If your MP voted in favour of the bill at second or third reading, it isn't really indicative of support for that particular clause. They might have voted it through to the next stage on the understanding that the Bill as a whole needed to be passed, and in the hope that the bad language would get fixed then. Of course, they will have also voted for/against because the Government/Opposition Whips ordered them to and threatened all kinds of unspeakable consequences if they didn't comply. (As an irrelevant aside about American politics - one of the greatest whips in history was Lyndon B Johnson, famous for delivering [""The Treatment""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson#Senate_Democratic_leader) to recalcitrant senators).

Between second and third reading are many more votes on individual pieces of Bill language. These take place at Committee stage (when a small group of MPs go through each line of the bill, voting on changes, before voting on whether whole clauses should stay in the bill). There is also a ""report"" stage in the main chamber, where the whole house can amend parts of the bill (though in practice if there has been a lengthy bun fight over an issue at committee stage, it is unlikely to get discussed again at report).

**What happened at Second Reading**

The whole debate is [here](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2013-06-10a.66.0&amp;s=%28annoy%29+speaker%3A24892#g87.0) and if you Ctrl+F for ""annoy"" you can see a couple of members of the Home Affairs Select Committee, [Keith Vaz](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2013-06-10a.66.0#g83.4) and [Julian Huppert](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2013-06-10a.66.0#g87.0), pointing out that ""annoy"" is a very woolly word to be trying to build enforcement measures around. Huppert in particular picks up that bringing raising the arm of the state against ""annoying"" people may be disproportionate: ""None of us wants these provisions to be used to deal with trivial behaviour.""

The Bill was not forced to a division at second reading. The Labour spokesman said, ""We welcome and support some of its measures, but we will test them in Committee. We will ensure that the Bill receives its Second Reading tonight so that we can address those issues."" Effectively, there was no vote because nobody forced one.

**So what happened at Committee Stage?**

When the committee was debating this particular clause, Gloria de Piero, speaking for Labour, registered objections about the change of language to ""annoy"", but was  generally far more bothered about Labour's ""ASBO"" system being branded a failure and taken to pieces by a new coalition system.

When the vote came on whether to keep the clause, the Committee divided on party lines ([debate, with votes at the bottom](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmpublic/antisocialbehaviour/130625/am/130625s01.htm)). 

As noted, Labour's objections seems to be couched more in a desire to protect the ASBO legacy of their last government. The only people who had really seemed unhappy about the new language at this stage were outside spokespersons from Liberty [who had given evidence to the Committee at a public evidence session](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/pbc/2013-14/Anti-social_Behaviour%2C_Crime_and_Policing_Bill/04-0_2013-06-20a.4.33). 

**What happened at Report**

In a mirror of the second reading debate, [there was some discussion](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2013-10-14b.508.0) of whether lining measures up against ""annoying"" people was disproportionate, but no specific vote on Clause 1.

**What happened at third reading**

The only MP to raise the issue about ""annoyance"" was, once again, [Julian Huppert](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2013-10-15b.655.0#g697.2).

The Labour shadow minister said:

""We support aspects of the Bill, then, but firmly do not support other aspects. On balance‚Äîto let you into a secret, Madam Deputy Speaker‚ÄîLabour Members will give the Bill an unopposed Third Reading, but we will seek to take those matters forward.""

As at second reading, the Labour party supported enough of the Bill that they weren't willing to force it to a vote.

**Conclusions**

This is a very truncated scan of all the relevant materials but it seems to me that although some MPs raised concerns (notably Julian Huppert, Cambridge), there was no *specific* discussion or vote on the ""annoy"" language in Clause 1 apart from the stand-part debate at committee, which only a few MPs took part in. Your MP may have voted for/against aspects of the Bill at different stages but there was no vote on this aspect of Clause 1, and they never had an opportunity to vote for or against the Bill as a whole. You should assume that your MP, until today, probably didn't have much of an awareness of any problems with Clause 1.

**What can I do?**

If you are concerned about the government attempting to insert this language back in, you should write to your local MP and ask them to vote to keep the new language when Lords amendments go back to the Commons.",0,1389269256,null,0,1389277411,0,cel882l,t3_1uqsbv,t1_cel882l,t1_cel6uh2,null,1431866717,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

In terms of places to live, avoid Sturry Road, Military Road, Hales Place, Tennyson Avenue most of Wincheap (up till about Oxford road area) 
and don't live in the old tannery area either. Try and live around Nunnery fields or old/new dover road, or possibly on/around St.Thomas' Hill or Westgate. 

Not a massive town is Canterbury, but it gets inside people for some reason. pubs are very nice the summer evenings, and you can really be on the continent in a matter of hours or in London. The cathedral is pretty awesome. Blean woods, whitstable, all not bad.

true,Shaper_pmp,null,null,"&gt; Setting a precedent that it's ok to shoot an unarmed man because you have intel that he has commited crimes in the past or is about to commit a crime is not a good thing.

Again, you're carefully reframing the debate to give your position unfair advantage, and completely ignoring 90% of the arguments in my comment that you can't refute, because they're completely reasonable..

Nobody said it was ok to shoot someone merely because they have a criminal record.

What we said was that it's *reasonable* to treat someone as a serious threat if they're known to own an illegal firearm, reasonably believed to be in possession of it *and* (as a lesser point) known to be someone prone to violence or breaking the law.

&gt; at the end of the day how bad of a person he was is irrelevant.

Irrelevant to the question of ""whether you should be allowed to shoot them dead on the street for no reason"", sure, but then nobody's *arguing* that the police should be allowed or encouraged to summarily execute people for no reason.  However, when deciding how best to approach and confront a potentially dangerous person and the level of potential risk they present (and hence what behaviour on their part might justify a lethal response), it's *entirely* reasonable to factor in whether they're a 78 year-old member of the Rotary club or a young gang-affiliated criminal.

Even if you believe both individuals have a gun on them, it's likely to be a lot safer (and hence your threshold for shooting will naturally be a lot higher) to approach the law-abiding old bowls-playing duffer than the individual with a history of breaking the law.  In the limit cases, if you're confronting a nun about possession of a firearm anything short of her actively pointing at you is unlikely to provoke a lethal response, whereas - on the other end of the spectrum - a suspected-armed known terrorist or violent criminal with a string of gratuitous murders in their past might only have to suddenly reach into their pocket or put their hands out of view before people think it's justified to perceive it as a threat.

Don't get me wrong; I'm not saying Duggan's death was *justified* - it was a tragedy however and whyever it happened.  I'm saying that the nature of the person they were approaching (and the degree of certainty regarding their possession of a firearm), however, can make such mistakes or tragedies more or less *understandable*, and the understandableness of the incident should factor into whether the killing is ruled legal or illegal, and whether anyone should be charged over it.",0,1389269455,null,0,1389275913,0,cel898x,t3_1us2qk,t1_cel898x,t1_cel81j1,null,1431866732,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Re letting agents: do not rent from Sandersons if you can help it, they are awful to their student tenants and I doubt they'd be much better for young profressionals. iConn are okay but a bit hopeless/slow when things go wrong (my boyfriend's house was without a properly functioning oven for about three months).

Canterbury itself is a lovely place to live. With several universities there are a number of societies so there's always something to get involved in (they accept non-students so you're cool there). The nightlife isn't like London or anything, but it's enjoyable and safe, so that's important. The surrounding areas are also worth visiting if you can get to them.

She told her solicitor she was a catholic, the solicitor didn't explain that there's no such thing as half a divorce (i.e. you can't agree a divorce settlement and then not make the divorce final) or that there exists an alternative known as a judicial separation (which legally separates the couple but doesn't dissolve the marriage). The question here is ""should the solicitor have probed her more deeply about why she was seeing a divorce lawyer if her religion prohibited divorce""?
 1. She reached a settlement with her ex-husband based on her income. Or, more accurately, her and her ex-husbands solicitors thrashed out a settlement that she agreed to. It wasn't until after the settlement was all agreed with the court that she noted that she'd had a substantial drop in her income which wasn't accounted for when drafting the settlement. A drop she did tell her solicitors about before they thrashed out the settlement. 
 1. Her Aspergers meant that while she was able to hold an intelligent conversation and a lay person might have no idea that she had a problem - it did make it a lot harder for her to process information in some situations. Such as processing the information that her divorce lawyer had obviously assumed she was seeking a divorce and once proceedings were complete, the marriage would be over.

I think the problem is that when *everyone* is drunk you can let go and say/do things which are inadvisable when sober. When there's somebody sober it brings into focus the fact that you're acting like a tit and drunk, and it makes you keep a better hold on yourself to avoid their judgement.

This of course defeats the entire point of drinking - lowering social barriers and inhibitions. If drink doesn't do that it's just a rather uncomfortable feeling of having self-control taken out from under you while you're trying to keep it together.

Not a trial, an inquiry. 

&gt;I always expected the people to find the killing lawful despite the evidence because they were going up against the state, the most powerful institution in our society, backed by cultural hegemony, the most powerful ideology in our society. 

Please let me know to which evidence you have intimate knowledge of. Do you seriously think you know more about the evidence than the jurors?

&gt;People have been socialised since their birth about the necessity and goodness of the police, which means despite agreeing Duggan had no gun, they agreed the killing was lawful.

You are illiterate in the law then. The families lawyers had to *prove beyond a reasonable doubt* that the police did not have a reasonable suspicion to fear for their life. With the intelligence leading up to the stop, the speed of his movements when exited the car and his hand movements, the family had very little chance to meet the burden of proof for a unlawful result.

&gt;For the gun found to be Duggan's he must have thrown it, the police would have seen that considering they stopped the taxi.

Heat of the moment can be a powerful argument in these cases to say you didn't see anything. However, I believe the police most likely planted the gun after the shooting. This wouldn't have any bearing on the lawfulness of the killing however. 

&gt;This just another in a long line of blacks killed by police with the predictable support of ruling white institutions of society.

You really have a big chip on your shoulder. The jury, the people that heard all the evidence and made the decision, we're predominantly black women.

The Indigenous Australians are stuck in a rut (apparently) because of actions that the 'white man' did half a century ago, but they can't get out of that rut because of their reputation for being stuck *in* the rut. 

Businesses won't hire an Indigenous man because he has a reputation for being a drunkard, and he in turn becomes a drunkard because he ends up on welfare with no prospects of upward mobility. The Australian government has a number of initiatives in place to assist Indigenous youth with getting an education and finding work, but it's still not enough. It's a bit unfair to put the blame solely on one party like many people do.

I'm a Chinese Australian and I grew up in an Indigenous area so I've seen this sort of thing first hand. And call me racist, but the reputation that Indigenous Australians have for being violent is not unfounded. Not in the slightest. Maybe they're not given enough opportunities, or maybe they're not trying hard enough themselves to break the stereotypes and look for a life outside of boozing and living on welfare. Not all Indigenous Australians are like this of course, but for the ones that are, it certainly poses a few questions. 

It's easy to call someone racist when you haven't personally experienced being chased by Indigenous men; publicly threatened, berated, insulted and all the rest of it.

Which is part of the problem; the bar for arresting a member of the public is incredibly low. When a member of the public shoots someone, they *will* be arrested even if it seems like a prima facie case of self-defence so that evidence can be gathered and they can be interviewed under caution before any collusion or witness tampering can take place. Failing to apply the same standard to armed police is inexcusable.

Such as processing the information that her divorce lawyer had obviously assumed she was seeking a divorce and once proceedings were complete, the marriage would be over.


The rest of it seems... a little more reasonable (although I have limited sympathy for someone who requests a divorce without actually checking into what that means) but this seems unfair to the solicitors. In fact, it specifically is reported that the Aspergers had not been diagnosed at the time of the divorce. In order for the solicitor to have taken this into account, they would've had to diagnose the woman (who was a psychologist, so probably should've had an idea of it herself) which they are clearly not in any position to do.

In other words, the fact that she had undiagnosed aspergers shouldn't have any bearing on the case, because it would be absurd to expect the lawyers to pick up on it.

true,LostThineGame,null,null,"&gt;Firstly, honestly I don't know how we live in a country where we can kill unarmed people. I don't understand how that isn't a mistake, albeit potentially a genuine one.

Quoting from the BBC Home Affairs correspondent:

&gt;How did the Duggan jury come to a conclusion that critics say is baffling and perverse?

&gt;It comes down to their judgement of what happened in the heat of the moment.

&gt;Police can't gun down a suspect just because they think he is an armed gangster.

&gt;They are governed by the same law as the rest of us, which says we are each entitled to use reasonable force to defend ourselves or another from injury.

&gt;Reasonable force depends on the circumstances.

&gt;The shooter told the jury he believed Mark Duggan was holding a gun and was going to pull the trigger.

&gt;Even though the jury found that Mr Duggan probably threw away the gun as police surrounded him, eight of them concluded the officer's use of force was proportionate because of his perception of the threat.

&gt;That's why a majority decided Mr Duggan was lawfully killed.

Please remember that this was just an inquest. Think of it as a fact finding procedure rather than a trial. Let me quote a bit from [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquests_in_England_and_Wales):

* It is not for the inquest to ascertain ""how the deceased died"" or ""in what broad circumstances"", but ""how the deceased came by his death"", a more limited question.[7] Moreover, it is not the purpose of the inquest to determine, or appear to determine, criminal or civil liability, to apportion guilt or attribute blame.[9] For example, where a prisoner hanged himself in a cell, he came by his death by hanging and it was not the role of the inquest to enquire into the broader circumstances such as the alleged neglect of the prison authorities that might have contributed to his state of mind or given him the opportunity.

Issues as to whether there is any liability from the Met would be dealt with in the civil courts I presume. We'll probably have a case and the Met will most likely assume some monetary compensation. 

&gt;Secondly, juries can be shit, especially in high profile cases where it is near on impossible to avoid the initial media coverage, which by the way claimed that Duggan shot at them. A tonne of people have gone to jail and then been later exhonerated, look at the Guildford Four or the Birmingham Six.
Justice is ultimately a perception so I have no qualms with them saying they have not had justice. I also don't believe that we can have fair trials when the police are under suspicion.

Well, if your only counter points are that justice is subjective and juries make mistakes then it's a fairly weak stance to take. You're essentially saying anything and everything can be called justice, in which case the word is entirely meaningless.

The police officer(s) who actually fired their guns, thus causing the death of a human being, should probably be interviewed under caution before any collusion or witness tampering could take place, just like anyone else who has caused the death of another human being. The traditional way police interview people under caution is formal arrest, so as to reduce questions of impropriety and ensure everything is properly documented.

true,TJP343,null,null,"It's an interesting take on Sherwood's way of play so far but I think it glamorizes what Sherwood has done a bit too much. He may be influenced by Pellegrini's system or he may be doing what many of us think he is doing, keeping it simple, reverting to a traditional formation and trying to not bog the players down with heavy tactical information as a way of differing himself with the previous manager. 

It's more likely a coincidence born out of a lack of options more than anything. Rose and Walker are the only viable options at fullback and both have played this way their entire careers, Chiriches and Dawson are the only fit and trusted centerbacks at this point and the fact that Dawson is clearly so lacking in pace would make anyone paired with him look the more daring and forced to be more daring from time to time because Dawson simply isn't going to step out from the back, he knows he should not and no one would encourage him to do otherwise.

Fielding Eriksen out in the wide areas and letting him drift in does sound like what Silva/Nasri do for City, it is the same role. But that's Eriksen's tendency, he always going to operate in those areas because that's where he feels comfortable, in the same way that Van Der Vaart drifted infield when Harry put him wide out on the right. It's what he does, not what he's being told to do. And it's a matter of necessity, if you're going to play with a flat midfield four someone from somewhere needs to roam in between the lines to link play from the midfield to the strikers.

The strikers are an interesting comparison, sure, but the fact is, modern strikers play in a large variety of different ways as it is, their naturally tendencies differ. No one plays with two out and out traditional center forwards anymore, there is always one striker looking to hold up while the other works the channels or one looking to make runs in behind while the other drops and so on. This is not unique to Manchester City or Tottenham under Sherwood or Tottenham under Harry when Crouch and VDV played big man, little man.

The comparison with City's strikers themselves doesn't work, as the article does mention, because there is Sergio Aguero and Luis Suarez alone in the group of EPL strikers that are so outstandingly good that on their day they do the work of two strikers, they play the drop off to midfield and make runs in behind role in the same match and do it better than just about anyone else. Spurs do not have an Aguero or a Suarez, which gives City and Liverpool the license to get away with a lot more from a strike duo than Spurs.

Soldado is a poacher, a very, very good one, all his goals in La Liga last season came from inside the box. And he's shown the ability to work the channels and play balls in to Adebayor to surprisingly good effect lately. Surprisingly not because of his talent but because at Valencia he was a lone striker and the one getting the service, not providing. But neither Soldado or Adebayor are lightening quick forwards looking to make runs in behind to through balls or balls over the top. That type of striker allows for quick strikes and adds randomness to the attack and Spurs do not have that dynamic.

The two in midfield is a weak comparison, yes, they are two of them in each system but it doesn't go much beyond that. City's duo have more of tendency to sit behind the attack and time their interventions to the build up and attack phase much better than the Spurs' duos we have seen under Sherwood. Now again, as the articles mentions, Spurs are without Sandro and Paulinho, and that is the pairing that could emulate what City's pair do.

City's midfield duo is able to form a block of four with their centerbacks very quickly when City go out of possession and allow the fullbacks time to recover, City don't get caught out an awful lot on the counter despite their fullbacks(and everyone elses) being slower than Spurs' tandem. 

The tendencies of City's midfield pairing are more conservative than that of what Spurs have been able to field and their understanding of playing the double pivot is better, in fact, Spurs are not playing a double pivot at all, they're playing with two box to box mids, as mentioned in the article, but they do not have a good understanding of ""you go I'll sit, ok, now I'll go and you sit"" that City does. Again, the way around this is Sandro, he won't play a double pivot either, he'll do the other thing you do with a central midfield pairing, one always sits, Sandro, the other pushes on or is allowed license to create from deep. This is the creator/destroyer pairing we saw when Modric was here and paired with either Sandro or Nice Hair's Scott Parker.

Spurs have no strict assignments to the midfield pairing, nor a mutual understanding between them of who will do what and when, they both go out and there and give it a go. 

Look at the average positioning of City and Spurs again, Spurs midfielders are literally right on top of each other and not sitting in their own half, where as City's duo we see a more clear separation of their average position and their number 25 is more noticeably withdrawn than the rest of the midfield and sitting just inside his own half. That's someone, whether by natural tendency, an understanding with his partner or directions from the manager, acting as the holding midfielder, something we know is lacking in Spurs play under Sherwood.

It's a nice article but I think it over stretches and complicates what Sherwood is really doing, which is simplifying the tactical instructions, picking what he thinks his best eleven is and playing a system anyone can play that will work most of the time.

It's more a matter of circumstance and coincidence than anything consciously being done by Sherwood to mirror someone else's success.

Also, just by chance, I watched Manchester City 1 Bayern Munich 3 last night from the Champions League in October and Bayern completely and utterly dominated the game for the opening 75 minutes playing their 4-1-4-1 against City's 4-4-2, City did not have a shot on target until after they were down 0-3 and even when trying to press Munich for much of the first half, Munich easily kept the ball and dominated the midfield areas.

It was one of the most impressive performances of football I have seen. Now, Bayern Munich does that to a lot of teams, but we are talking about the most threatening team in England, at home, looking like they didn't have so much as a clue what to do against Munich. 

If Tottenham are a poor mans Man City, then it's safe to say Arsenal is a poor man's Bayern Munich. If Spurs are going to emulate someone, we should look at the Bavarians. ",0,1389278259,null,0,false,0,celaaaz,t3_1usfdk,t1_celaaaz,t3_1usfdk,null,1431867688,12,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,12

Murder or manslaughter. Just like anyone else who claims they shot someone in self-defence.

&gt;He could have been interviewed under caution without arrest, but without the arrest you couldn't prevent collusion. Or even guarantee he'd turn up.

Right, which is why s/he really ought to be arrested. I think there are too many collateral consequences to arrest in this country which does make it very unfair to people who genuinely are innocent, but the solution to that is entirely separate from this issue.
&gt;And even then he still could just go no comment and produce a written statement later. You know they always say ""never talk to the police?"".

Yes, but as I said, if someone does that in an interview under caution and then attempts to argue justification at a judicial adjudication, adverse inferences can be drawn under CJPOA1994.

And that would be every bit as true for a judicial separation, which she is suing her lawyers for not informing her about. It would also be true in a clean break settlement. 

The violation of the vows comes when she or her husband leave the marriage, and seek to have their financial proceedings separated. She has unambiguously sought out that end, and the technical fact of state recognition does not alter or change in any way her abandoning of those vows, or the sacrament of marriage generally.

The catholic matrimonial vows do not mention making sure to keep the marriage registered by civil authority. The are entirely focussed on spending ones life together, and the way in which that is done. Upholding the sacrament is the keeping of those vows.

I would mention that some lawyers claim otherwise, and try and sell these to catholics. My point here is not without contention. I happen to believe it is correct however: these lawyers I believe are shysters, and catholics who buy into it are going along with a hypocritical legal farce, and would be better off admitting their faiths position is incompatible with their life.

Now, some links: [Demography of UK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_Kingdom) and [Demography of Poland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Poland) as well as this one: [Ethnic minorities in Poland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_minorities_in_Poland)

96.5% of Polish citizens claim Polish nationality. This already gives you certain number. Now, in 2011 census 418k of Poles claims (Silesian) as their first nationality. Second group being German with 59k (drop from 2002 from 152k, most probably because they ""became"" Polish citizens and claimed Polish nationality as first). Silesians are basically Poles but due to changed borders after II WW many of them were actually more German (or actually German) then Poles. We have plenty of other immigrant groups, obviously not as high as in UK but its mostly due to historical events in our country and surrounding ones.

Interesting facts from the history - [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_demography_of_Poland)

* Poland was in union with Lithuania , where plenty of Eastern Europe nationalities lived and mixed with each other;

* Breakout of Total 1931 Polish Population by Language and Religion Figures as % of Total Population - Polish 68%, Ukrainian 20%;

* Before World War II, the Polish lands were noted for the richness and variety of their ethnic communities. Following the Polish-Soviet War, a large part of its population belonged to national minorities. The census of that year allocates 30.8% of the population in the minority

* In 1931, Poland had the second largest Jewish population in the world, and one-fifth of all Jews resided within Poland's borders (approx. 3,136,000, roughly 10% of the entire Polish population);

What I'm trying to say is that we as a country were one of the most liberal in history. I obviously don't know details about all those historical events but quite possibly ""somehow"" people in our country coexisted quite peacefully... until Hitler and Stalin killed nearly 6mln of our citizens.

Britain has people of origin: 4.2mln Asian, 1.8mln Black, 1.2mln Mixed and 1.9mln of ""other white"". Why sudden big deal and requirement to control UK's borders after 700k Poles came to UK legally, in the period of 10 years, under EU laws. Poles who came here to work, contribute and mix well with societies. Who came here in their ""best age"" (after education, before retirement). Poles of whom many will go back to their country as (believe me) there are plenty of reasons to go back. We even share same religion and very similar other points, meaning you won't see a Pole wearing fancy Asian clothes or doing jihad war.

If UK wants to have a serious talk about immigration then why not include all other people (immigrants) in it and not point fingers at only specific groups?

Also, even statistically looking, there is no way many more Poles will come to UK (this figure will stay at similar level as some come in, some go out - proven facts). How would you resolve immigration from India or China where there are billions of people? Nobody asks UK to bring more outer EU immigrants.

Obviously it would never have happened without the Sheiks petrodollars but when you've spent your entire life watching City sign players like 'Fat' Bob Taylor and Bernardo Corradi I couldn't care less where the money comes from.

The good thing about it is City's owners have invested so much money into the surrounding area of Manchester. They make a point of hiring local people e.g [60% of workers on the stadium expansion will be local](http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/etihad-stadium-expansion-plan-new-6197977)

When you compare City's owners to people like Bond villain Vincent Tan or the Glazers and their massive debt it becomes obvious how good City's owners actually are.

2. The issue with De Menezes was faulty intelligence.

The whole ""shoot to kill"" debacle that followed was people focusing on the wrong aspect (they way he was taken down, not the reason) who obviously knew nothing about how firearms or human anatomy works.

3. With Duggan the intelligence was correct but he (unknowingly to the officers) was able to dispose of the gun. He then however disobeyed police orders and made a movement that led to the officer thinking he was about to pull a gun so he took the appropriate and lawful action to stop this perceived threat.

4. Unfortunately we will never be in a situation where a threat can be 100% confirmed as deadly. What if they shoot someone who points a replica at them?

Adebayor said he had to go, he was captain of the team and it was the president of his country, he felt he couldn't say no, he had to go with the team.

From there, they were delayed in getting back to Togo because their FA could not arrange a flight for them in a reasonable amount of time and they sat around wasting time waiting for a flight to get back home to be booked.

It was a fiasco, but not one of Adebayor's creation. He was caught between club and country duties by no fault other than trying to be a good teammate, country man and captain of his national team.

Sherwood is also a football man and surely knows the PL well, surely he has noticed the set-up that Man City play and how much success this has given them? As both the article and you mentioned, I hope we can get Paulinho back asap and try and create a double pivot, something I think could work very well.

Also in regards to your comment comparing Man City to Bayern, Bayern is definitely the better team but I would say the gap isn't as far as some would suggest.

Sure I might still work if I was taxed at 90% for every penny I earned past 150 grand, but only if that was my only option. Suddenly firms operating abroad that may have a pay without tax of 3/4 of what Im currently being paid without tax are far more attractive. Firms find it harder to get the best workers and therefore are less competitive or choose to go abroad.

As far as the idea that CEOs are valued at 3 times what they were over the last decade (a figure which I find hard to believe) I'm afraid this reflects international trends once again.

The outrage here is not about Duggan, but because there is a huge mutual distrust between significant sections of society and the police as an institution. That's why the Met acted the way it did, and why the response played out the way it did.

In other words: it's less what did or didn't happen, but that Duggans family and community by and large do not believe what the Police tell them, and the way things were handled did little to inspire confidence.

&gt;I'm looking for a perspective on what it's like to win trophies in this manner - to put it bluntly (and I honestly don't mean to cause offense here, so please don't take it the wrong way), does the success feel like yours, or Mansour's?

I think we need to be a bit careful here in how we're framing the question, if you swap in City/Mansour for any other Club/owner then it just seems an invalid question but I see the point that you're driving at.

Manchester City is a 133 year old Football Club, started out of a Church in Manchester.  During this period it has had the biggest Club stadium in England, some of the highest attendences in the league, has won FA Cups and rode high in the leagues.  Pre-WW2 we were one of the biggest Clubs in the country and pre-WW1 we had a decent argument at being THE biggest Club in the country.  It has also been relegated to Division Two, lived in the shadows of the world's most famous Club, bounced around leagues, went almost bankrupt a good 4 times in my memory and had an old dilapidated stadium that almost fell over.

I say this because one of the things that being a fan of a Club for years gives you is a perspective on history.  I see lads on here posting videos of City games gone past and have spotted myself in the crowd, usually with a bad haircut and crap fashion sense (to which little has changed I'm afraid).  It's also why I don't tend to get upset over bad runs or a bad season, I'll be here next season just as I was the last, if we don't do well this season there's always next year.  Support is not tied to results nor league placing or even attractive football.  You don't support a Club because you want to but because the thought of doing otherwise never occurred to you.  

I've seen Sheikh Mansour, Thaskin Shinawatra, John Wardle, David Bernstein, Francis Lee, and Peter Swales in charge of the Club.  Never at this point did I feel that the victories on the pitch were down entirely to the boardroom and were ever anything but victories for Man City.

Sheikh Mansour provided City with a huge amount of investment.  This investment allowed City to acquire some of the best staff in the world and I'm not just talking about players here but little known things like the Performance Analysis Department, the Communications Department, our medical staff, the logistics people who ensure that everything in the running and rebuilding of the Club runs smoothly.

We have ~500 permanent employees and each one of them works every single day to make our dreams of success a reality.  I think it would be extremely unfair to oversimplify a day to day's business success by saying ""it was all the Sheikh"".  I also think that it would be a fantasy to believe that these staff would all be employed and of that quality if the investments from Sheikh Mansour never appeared.

Money in football allows you the freedom to make mistakes.  Going back to the playing side here, it allowed us to take a ¬£25m gamble of the fitness of Roque Santa Cruz and another ¬£25m gamble on the disruptive behaviour of Carlos Tevez.  I'd say that one of them paid off and the other didn't.  Normally Clubs could never take these types of gambles without huge consequences, both financial and logistical.  The forgotten people in football, the non-technical backroom staff are always the first people to lose their jobs when times get hard.  City recently sacked their league winning manager and paid him years of compensation because they wanted to go in another direction.  No other Club outside of Chelsea could even afford to do this, let alone risk the fallout in the playing and technical staff.

We also took other gambles outside of the playing squad.  We gambled that creating a TV channel like Liverpool TV, Chelsea TV, Relamadridtv, MUTV, etc was the wrong direction to go in and we would be better served by building/promoting the brand using Youtube and social media.  One of the great benefits of the Sheikh's investment was that because we were underdeveloped as a Club before due to financial problems, we can now start afresh.  MUTV happened because Youtube wasn't around then. MCFCTV was a gamble that seemingly worked.

We are gambling again, we have announced stadium expansion plans to expand the stadium from 47,000 to 62,000 making us the second biggest ground in the country.  We sell out every home match in the league but nobody has any idea whether the demand is truly there for another 15,000 seats.  But City are confident that it will be eventually so they should make hay whilst the Sun shines.  

This is the freedom that the investment of Sheikh Mansour has actually created, in real terms and it applies at all levels of the Club.  City have a pre-match entertainment area called BT Sport City Square, where there are live bands and food and drink on sale, it's a bit of a meeting place.  I have no idea whether this is a loss maker or not but again, freedom to gamble and see what works.  

This attitude of creativity and, to use one of City's buzzwords, holistic approaches has made it a great time to be a fan. We're currently building a new training complex called the Etihad Campus (which is coming along nicely and will be done at the end of this season) next to the current ground and it has a mini-stadium which fans have already named the Minihad.  City's reserve/youth teams and women's teams will play here in an attempt to get the Club as a more rounded entity.  City's Ladies team have never really been embraced by the Club before and seeing another very old institution come under the umbrella is heartening.

I wanted to explain all of these things because you may now understand my answer a bit more.  Is the success the success of City or the success of Mansour?  It is the success of City as a Club, which never could have achieved half of what it has on and off the pitch without Mansour.

Personally, in the stands you don't watch Balotelli knock the ball to Aguerooooooooooooooooooooo against QPR and think about Sheikh Mansour.  City is my Club, and a Club that belongs to every other City fan.  Owners come and go and whilst this one has been an extraordinarily good one for us, it's not like we didn't exist before him.

Most of the time I watch our team in absolute awe.  The football that we play at times is just stunning, and how lucky we are to watch talented boys like Silva, Yaya and Aguero play in front of us every week.  It's a privilege to be a City fan at the moment and I often fondly think back to big Andy Morrison or Bob Taylor and think how long ago that seems.  We've come a long way in a short amount of time.

People call newer City fans ""gloryhunters"".  I'm a gloryhunter.  I was a gloryhunter in the 80's when we had a great youth teams coming though and a gloryhunter in the late 90's when were couldn't string two wins together.  I always wanted City to win trophies, I don't see why any new fans would be any different. 

I personally don't mind that our Club is now one which attracts the attention of many worldwide followers.  Manchester United and the Big Five created the very situation which allowed Sheikh Mansour to take over, of which we were one of the major whipping boys for 20 years, so you'll have to forgive me if I decline to shed a tear for the death of football like many others have done.  To me as a City fan, Sheikh Mansour represents a man who invested in City for his personal interests that happened to align with my wildest dreams.

Just to note, City fans have a banner at the Etihad Stadium which simply reads ""Manchester Thanks You, Sheikh Mansour"".  This sums it up for.  He has come in and invested in our Club, invested in our community providing new jobs and better transport links into the areas in the most poverty and created a situation where I now go every week and David Silva rather than Mark Kennedy.  

The success is ours, together, as a community and a fanbase.",0,1389282406,null,0,false,0,celbpmy,t3_1usn5s,t1_celbpmy,t3_1usn5s,null,1431868453,35,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,35

What I'm suggesting is: Suarez's rating may be benefiting from a short-term and unsustainable level of incredible performance that doesn't accurately reflect his likely rating for the season compared to other players.

The fact is, police in the UK have very little practical experience dealing with armed criminals - they're trained, but they're hardly seasoned veterans.

Okay if you watched the Christmas special you know that the eleventh doctor confesses that he is the last incarnation of himself. He confirms that Tentoo or the meta crisis doctor counts as a regeneration and The war doctor obviously counts as well meaning the even tho he is the 11th he is on hi last life,
I call bullshit. 

Immediately fans may recall the impossible astronaut where the doctor is shot and begins regenerating, whoa! Calm down angry fans I know that that was just the teselecta and the doctor was hiding inside.
I would like to know how A. The teselecta was able to mimic regeneration energy and B. How river was unable to tell it was the teselecta since it has been stated several times time lords know each other just by looking at them. 


So we know that the impossible astronauts regen was fake but that's not where the plot hole comes from. My dear whovians look no further for traces of Moffat's impeccable story telling than in let's kill hitler. The doctor is poisoned by river with extract from the Judas tree. I can't remember the exact  dialogue but I believe the doctor asks the tardis computer something like what are my options and I think he mentions regenerating. The computer says the poison makes regeneration impossible and the doctor reacts with an angry snarl. if he's out of regens then why would he ask the computer and react angrily as if he had a plan that now would t work. 

Like I said I can't remember the exact dialogue so If any of you do please feel free to post it. 

Moving on to the angels take manhattan the doctor uses some regeneration energy to heal rivers broken hand. WTF moffat if he doesn't have anymore regens where did that energy come from? 

Once again I hear the raging of angry fans saying it could be left over from when river healed him. If that's the case then the plot hole becomes even bigger. If river did impart her regenerations onto the doctor then he wouldn't be out of regenerations. This is a very touchy spot though did river give him more energy or just heal him in either scenario the plot hole holds true

Either the doctor has absorbed rivers regen energy and has more regens or he the energy of possibly 9 or 10 whole regens is burnt up healing him. 

The only two scenarios that would explain the random burst of regen energy in TATM is that he isn't on his last life or river did impart her energy into him. 

If either of these scenarios are true this directly contradicts the doctors statement in the Christmas special. Again in the episode where the doctor takes clara to the moon and he is infected with cyber tech and is split into two personalities (the doctor and Mr clever) the doctor says ""I could regenerate and blast you out of me"" Mr Cleve replies with something like it would endanger the people around him. If he is out of regens why would he state this as a possible option? If he was lying to scare me clever how would that be possible? Mr clever is inhabiting the doctors brain and would know if he's on his last life. 

There are most likely other examples of this plot hole in the series but at present I can't recall any. Please feel free to add any you did and to correct any information I may have gotten wrong.

That said, I believe the jury's verdict was fair.

No matter how much training someone receives, they can never be expected to perform in a 100% rational manner in a high pressure situation.

I am dubious this women meets the highly specific and procedural standards laid out in the canons given her lack of awareness of judicial separation, or the finality of divorce, unless she was in physical danger.

Moreover, and this is key, the issue of civil divorce really doesn't arise in the canonical consideration of the issue, unless the subject is wanting to declare that they are not married. Its really neither here nor there if they want to seek a judicial separation or a civil divorce, the key is that they acknowledge they continue as married in the eyes of god, but separated.

To make a slightly glib point here, we possibly need to move away from the bible on this issue. The Roman Catholic faith is far less about the bible than it is about 1500 years of canon law and catechism. Straight biblical exegesis is far more an element of the Reformation.

But how good of a manager really was Ferguson? Well nobody knows and nobody ever will because no manager will be that lucky to be put in that sort of position again. My own opinion is that Ferguson was average, it was only through experience and longevity at the club that he managed to accomplish what he accomplished. 

His biggest accomplishment was creating an illusion of invincibility which didn't work against the bigger teams, but it worked wonders against the smaller ones. They would often give up all 3 points even before kickoff and would shit their pants if they managed to take the lead by accident somehow. Hence the big comebacks, not to mention that 75,000 people can be quite a bit louder than 45,000 people.

But now that the old fart is gone, that illusion is completely shattered and we now see that the team who won the league so comfortably last season is in fact, pretty average. So now all the smaller teams are having a proper go at them and it's a snowballing effect really, and an absolute pleasure to watch them get ripped apart by the likes of Sunderland. And the cherry on top is that the man who's taking all the abuse from his and everyone else's fans is David ""Gollum"" Moyes, the miserable bitter blueshite.

Secondly, presumably you live in the UK.  Taxation here is, what, around 40%, maybe more including things like income tax.  I don't see hundreds of people fleeing to Cambodia for the low low taxation rates there.

This from the high pay comission http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/jobs/8546801/Chief-executive-pay-vs-average-worker-pay-in-graphs.html?image=1 shows that CEO pay has roughly tripled over the last decade (figures are a bit old granted).

I don't really believe that globalisation directly leads to massive executive pay.  That should just lead to increasing specialisation in different things in regions.  I think executive pay, and the philsophy behind it (largely favouring short term profit over long term growth) is kinda fucked, since pits CEOs interests against those of employees and shareholders.  You end up with firms doing shit like PPI because they're seeking short term gains, since so many ceos get share options.  I think restructuring how pay packages are designed, as opposed to stupidly high tax rates (which are a blunt and somewhat imprecise tool, and only encourage people to spend lots of money on good tax accountants anyway) is probably the way to go.

The title says the narrative is fun but far from the truth, but no actual truths are provided by the writer to back up what he is saying. In fact, he doesn't really say anything other than what's being written about Adebayor isn't the whole story, well then tell the whole story.

The real truth is the writer doesn't know and no one who has spoken publicly that I'm aware of, really knows the deal with Adebayor and how he acts.

The most telling thing about Adebayor I have seen was the tunnel video for the Man City shit show this season. Adebayor comes in and is greeting people left and right, handshakes, high fives, smiles all around, not just to Man City players but the nameless people in the tunnel who work for City in some capacity.

Doesn't look like it was all doom and gloom for him there, does it? He's smiling a lot during matches, he seems generally normal and happy when we see him on tv but we've been lead to believe he's some sort of malcontent, drama queen always on the verge of losing it. Maybe it's true, but no one that paints him this way knows for sure. But you hear the same thing enough times you start to believe it.

The article conveniently uses his good season at Spurs on loan and his subsequent poor one last year as proof he only plays when motivated, which nicely glosses over the change in manager and tactics, doesn't it? Now someone else seemingly like good ol' Harry is back in charge and pumping up Adebayor's confidence and low and behold, he's playing well and enjoying his football.

He may only perform well under certain types of managers, not only perform well when he has something to prove. He scored regularly his last three seasons at Arsenal, 14 in all comps in his first season with City, 8 in 22 on loan to Madrid, 18 for Spurs his loan year. From 2006-07 until 2011-12 he scored a minimum of 12 goals a season, sounds pretty consistent to me. 

You could just as easily paint Adebayor as a player that scores wherever he goes, but he gets painted in a different light instead because he did not get on with Mancini. Carlos Tevez didn't get on great with him either. Mancini handled Balotelli relatively well, all things considered, but they are both Italian and Mancini bent over backwards to help him, something it does not seem he did with Tevez and Adebayor.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"i think that absolutely is part of it.

With the current scheme we have been running we are allowing Eriksen to move inside and be forward.  It opens up the left side of the defense that in itself can be difficult to contend with, add in Dawson's lack of pace on the right and by dropping Vlad back you are asking him to be a last man/safety in front of Hugo, his pace allows him to cover a massive amount of ground so he can try to react and deflect an attack that gets by Rose.

Bentaleb played much further up the pitch than i would have expected and you can see the massive amount of space behind Bentaleb and in front of Vlad. Then you see that Walcott was slightly shaded to that side of the pitch, Gnabry was sitting in that space with Rosicky shaded to that side, which would allow them to attack that space. Particularly with Gnabry this looks like an attempt to capitalize on that space whereas against United Valencia/Januzaj looked to exploit Rose more out on the wing. 

I think when we use Sandro you will see him sitting deeper and possibly shading a bit to Rose's side.  This obviously supports Rose but allows you to move Vlad a bit further up the pitch and shade him more towards the middle of the pitch.",0,1389287123,null,0,false,0,celdmin,t3_1usjr2,t1_celdmin,t1_celcdb7,null,1431869354,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

It's very easy. First I made all the characters with cross stitch in a black Aida. Then I ironed each piece with interlining, that way we prevent unravel. I didn`t fold it, (is difficult when the pieces are so small and the Aida so rigid) I just glued the characters to the bag with fabric glue. It's very effective, although you can also sew a few stitches to ensure.

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"From a non-subjective standpoint, there are a lot of UKIP politicians with questionable integrity. It's difficult to find a list of UKIP politicians, as they have gained many new ones over the last few months, and none have been elected in Commons, only European elections. However, if we look at some of the currently standing MEPs for UKIP, we can get a general idea of them:

* **Derek Clark, East Midlands:** I couldn't find much on him. The only concrete news story about him was [expenses fraud](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/apr/20/ukip-meps-misused-eu-allowances), as he claimed money for two assistants who were meant to work in the European Parliament, but actually stayed in Britain working for UKIP. While this does come off as hypocritical, as UKIP politicians often complain about the cost of Europe while this politician was actively defrauding it, pretty much every politician has abused expenses, and at least it wasn't going toward his duck pond.

* **Roger Helmer, East Midlands:** Now, he is a much more lovely bloke. Just skimming through his [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Helmer#Views), you'll find that he believes date rape victims should share some of the blame; that homophobia is 'is merely a propaganda device' designed to 'denigrate and stigmatise those holding conventional opinions' and that surgeons should be able to try and make gay people straight; that climate change is wrong as the ['world is cooling'](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/20/climate-denier-roger-helmer-church). 

* **Stuart Agnew, East of England:** This is another politician with nothing much about them. After cursory google, it appears he[ doesn't believe in gender discrimination](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/11/28/ukip-stuart-agnew-women_n_4355001.html) in the workplace or education, rather that women wanting babies makes them less ambitious and is the only thing stopping them from getting top jobs. 


* **Paul Nattall, North West England:** While not as bad as Helmer, Nattall seems to have similar opinions. He, too, is a sceptic of climate change. He wants to reinstate the death penalty for the [rights of the victims families](http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/northwest/9186807.Euro_man_favours_death_penalty/) (as 'revenge' is now a Human Right). He also opposes abortion. 

There are five more MEPs I didn't mention. Gerard Batten, Trevor Colman, the Earl of Dartmouth and John Bufton I left out because there was either very little information on them, or they had done nothing wrong that didn't come up after a google search of their names. There isn't much information on many UKIP politicians apart from Farage, which I would take as a deterrent on it's own. Because many UKIP politicians are so new, we don't know what opinions they hold, and as shown by the ones above, there is a seemingly high chance when compared to other parties that these politicians will be homophobic, or sexist.

You also have their policies and general ideology, which I disagree with, but that's entirely subjective.

Maybe I'm being cynical but I don't think this article is entirely unbiased or fair. It seems to push the Muslim view of alcohol and does not provide a more 'rounded' view. My view would be that you can have a drink perfectly fine in moderation. Some people can't control themselves or actively choose not do. That is when it can get messy. 

- They didn't interview anybody who gave the moderation argument.

- They interviewed kids who can't drink legally yet or only just can. I felt the same at their age but changed my mind. 

- They interviewed a Muslim who is banned from drinking due to his religion and has his own views of alcohol being 'wrong in society'.

- The article promotes Muslim 'shisha cafes' as an alternative despite the link with tobacco, another drug that is bad for you. Stop drinking and go smoke tobacco. Hmm, ok.

The article also quotes some very strange facts such as the amount of 11 to 15 year olds drinking. Nevermind the fact that it is illegal to do so and the kids would probably lie about having had a drink to protect their parents or friends. The young people interviewed are in the 14-18 age range. It is either illegal for them to be drinking or they are only just on the verge of having the open opportunity to drink.

true,DireDireDuck,flair8,,"Xhaka is interesting but I don't think he fits a need of ours right now. He plays a deep defensive midfielder role in M√∂nchengladbach's 4-4-2 formation, a position we have covered by Capoue, Sandro, Dembele, and Bentaleb (the latter two aren't ideal in that position, but Timmy likes to use them as such, especially as substitues). I think he's good for the future, but he didn't wow me last year, and has been average this year. A better idea would be to wait after the World Cup and see how he and Switzerland perform.

I would have loved to sign Shaqiri back when he was at Basel for 11.800.000 ‚Ç¨ (although it would probably be higher since we would likely lose any subsequent bidding war with Bayern). He's already Champions League quality and still has tons of potential. Unfortunately, Bayern already know this and he was brought in to become Robben's heir on the right, while also offering a quality selection on the left if Ribery is injured or declines. No chance we're getting him unless they bring in another type of player of Pep's choice.

If we do go after Swiss players, I'd prefer us to try and get Fabian Sch√§r from Basel. He's a CB which we may need seeing as Kaboul's contract is up at the end of the year, and Dawson isn't getting any younger. From what I can gather he is very talented as has performed well in the Champions League, however he seems to have discipline problems (nine yellows in 21 appearances this year). I wouldn't mind him being brought in to be our 3rd/4th CB at the moment and see if he can work his way into regular playing time, however, like Xhaka, it may be best to wait and see.

I agree with the way you're thinking, in that if we want to get any cheap, young players with potential to grow into starters, then the Bundesliga is probably the best place to look right now. Aside from CB and LB, I'd think our next biggest need would be ST. I've already written about him a bit [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/1uj0j0/were_looking_for_strikers_im_assuming/cein1bp), but Kevin Volland from 1899 Hoffenheim would seem like a good fit.

true,rootbeerfetish,tardis,TARDIS,Me and my fiance both agree that Moffat's story telling is convoluted and chaotic. But the Doctor is (was) cute and every episode is epic so who cares right? No... Moffat really loves out doing himself with how epic each of his stories are. It might make for good entertaining episodes at the moment but in general they're bad and don't sit well with the Doctor Who lore in general. Moffat seems to be at his best when someone is there with him holding his hand or checking up on him to make sure his stories don't get ridiculous. Hes the only man in charge lately and thus the quality of writing has suffered. I do try and remind myself that its only temporary as not only doctors change but so do writers and crew. So its only bad for now... Hopefully this method of 'lets see how much more epic this we can make this' goes away as its really quite annoying. Its not what the show is about and hopefully Peter Capaldi brings something better out in Moffat. At the very least the change in Doctors has gotten rid of the fan-girls that weren't true whovians but were just around to see a cute face every episode. That will hopefully change what the BBC is dishing out for the audience they expect to be watching. Hopefully...

Let's put it in perspective: Varney has spent a season and a half at the club and scored six goals. Smith has spent half a season at Leeds and already equaled Varney's goal total. With his added height and strength, Smith offers a lot more up front than Varney when you consider that one of his roles at Leeds has been leading the line and even acting as a target man.

Granted, many of Varney's appearances have been on the wing or off the bench, but he had the end of last season and beginning of this season to prove himself up front and just hasn't done it. What annoys me most, actually, is that I think Varney has all the right physical attributes for a footballer (he can leap like a salmon, he was one of the fastest players in the squad after White and Poleon - not that this says a lot - and has a good, agile build for dribbling), yet he just doesn't have a footballing brain. He literally tries to run **through** people with the ball, which about sums him up.

Ultimately, I genuinely believe that Varney is yet another in a long line of players who this club was too big for, especially when the fans expected a player who could adequately replace Robert Snodgrass.

true,tommaso18,null,null,"Maiga is a good player. He doesn't score many goals granted, but he works well for the team and for a short striker he has a very good leap on him, and is quite able to hold the ball up. The flack he is getting is unjustified in that he is playing in the wrong formation for his ability. He was excellent against West Brom when he was able to cut in on his left foot rather than being bombarded with long balls like we have done recently against Forest and City. 

The Forest game was shocking because of the team that Big Sam put out. Sure, give some youth players a run out but fuck me, the whole team was so weak. No leaders on the pitch whatsoever. Went 1 down to lower league opposition. Our reply? More youth players and long balls. We lost 5-0.

We were always going to play long balls against City though. And with the confidence so low they took full advantage and destroyed us. 

Our team is struggling with low morale, injuries, a moron for a captain, and Big Sam's stubborn inability to see that playing with one up front with everyone else back isn't the solution to solve our defensive problems.

I think it's ridiculous that Maiga is getting this stick. He hasn't been great, but neither has the rest of the team recently. Downing, Noble, Jussi and Reid have been the only quality players this season but when the morale is low it has an impact on the rest of the team which in turn also brings their performances down.

true,hamlet9000,mcgann,McGann,"&gt; 1) You really think that The Crimson Horror is better than Fear Her and Love and Monsters? Really? 

No. Which is why I said exactly the opposite of that.

&gt; 2) RTD's deus ex's machina's didn't even make sense. Jesus Doctor? What? At least Moffat's had a bit of an oh shit that's cool factor. Tell me you didn't get that when John Hurt was introduced. Tell me you didn't get that when the ultimate question was revealed.

Neither of those things are deus ex machina.

&gt; 4) You seriously didn't find anything good in S7. Angels take Manhattan? Town Called Mercy? The Snowmen? What didn't you like about the Name of the Doctor?

""Angels Take Manhattan"": No. Ignoring the multitude of pacing problems and the Angel of Liberty (which doesn't make any sense and was also completely irrelevant), the fatal problem with this episode is that the final fate of Amy and Rory makes absolutely no sense. It's pretty much the crowning moment in the ""Moffat Doesn't Actually Understand Time Travel"" world tour.

""Town Called Mercy"": The first half of this episode is pretty good. The second half falls apart into poorly paced nonsense and the ""resolution"" is a *High Noon* rip-off which nevertheless doesn't make any sense.

""The Snowmen"": It's not a terrible episode. But it's thoroughly mediocre.

""The Name of the Doctor"": Beyond the fan service, there's absolutely nothing to like about this episode. Moffat rips himself off to create the Whisper Men. When faced with the fact that the entire hook of the episode was nonsense, Moffat responded by making a [Blu-Ray special](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Clarence_and_the_Whispermen) in an effort to explain it (but actually just ends up contradicting the episode itself). The bulk of the episode serves mainly to remind us that the Great Intelligence was never actually established as a coherent villain in this season (and does nothing to grant him coherency now). 

And the end of the episode, of course, is yet another ""alternate universe created by an assassination attempt on the Doctor that threatens to destroy the universe, but is averted because... deus ex machina"".

(Bonus points for hinging the deus ex machina on the stakes of Clara being totally dead if she jumps into the scar... and then just saying ""fuck it"" 30 seconds later and using another deus ex machina to save her. Extra bonus points for the deus ex machina used to save her having been established as being impossible, but then simply ignoring that with *another deus ex machina*. Moffat's getting deus ex machina in his deus ex machina in his deus ex machina.)

The fact that it took two whole episodes before Moffat retconned the entire episode out of existence (with yet another deus ex machina, 'natch) really makes the whole package particularly impressive.",0,1389291137,null,0,false,0,celfgpi,t3_1ursgv,t1_celfgpi,t1_cel6aow,null,1431870249,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

Who do you think sets the response time? Do you think the government sets a nationwide target response time? No, it is set by each brigade in agreement with their authority.

Look on the LFB website:

Under the proposals, the Brigade would maintain its existing London-wide attendance target of getting a first fire engine to an emergency within an average six minutes and the second fire engine, if needed, within eight minutes. This is amongst the fastest target response time of any emergency service in the country and almost twice as fast as some other fire brigades.

Seems that way! As far as I can gather, the judge's attitude was ""You had plenty of opportunity to raise this complaint when the settlement was being thrashed out and you didn't make a peep. It's only now - some time later - that you're attempting to get redress by suing them for professional negligence. Suck it up, love, you could and should have dealt with this as soon as it arose"".

(Which makes sense because ISTR that a fundamental point of civil law is that you have a duty to minimise your losses. In other words, if you see a legal trainwreck waiting to happen and you don't do anything about it even though you had plenty of opportunity to do so, you can't later sue your lawyer for professional negligence).",0,1389292622,null,0,1389292995,0,celg620,t3_1uscjl,t1_celg620,t1_cele0hw,null,1431870556,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

EU - personally I broadly support the principles behind the EU and believe we should remain a part of it. I have done a fair bit of business in Europe and think leaving would be very damaging.

They have influenced the political language on this to a point where it gets into every day life, even kids are reporting a massive increase of racial abuse.  (69% according to childline)
Homophobia - against same sex marriage. Why should the state dictate who you fall in love with?
Denial of climate change

&gt;And there needs to be some serious reviews on the training and protocols of the Armed Response units. How a highly trained officer can believe there was a gun in Mark's hand '100%' when there wasn't is a question that needs to be addressed.

&gt;Yes, many police do a great job in helping to make their community a better place, but when we grant these powers they must always be held accountable. No one is above the law, and no one can dish out their own judgements outside of a court.

&gt;Regardless of the act of carrying a gun on you and how bad that is, there is no death penalty for it and no officer has the right to take a life unless a serious threat is identified. The fact an officer was so badly wrong is at best gross incompetence and at worst Murder.

Obviously I'm not a judge, but I'd consider the law as it stands to conform to this requirement.

The closest I can find to what you want is searches under the Terrorist Act of 2000, which was challenged by [Gillian and Quinton v. The United Kingdom](http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/2010/28.html) ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillan_and_Quinton_v_United_Kingdom)), in which it was decided that the stop and search powers of the police *without* reasonable suspicion were a violation of the right to privacy. This implies that *with* reasonable suspicion -- which is still a weaker requirement than ""probable cause"" -- stop and search powers do conform to the convention. But maybe another case in future will cause that to be reviewed (but I doubt it).

I'm uncomfortable with the power that the police have to stop and search anyone they decide they reasonably suspect of carrying something they shouldn't - particularly if it's just an amount of drugs for personal use, but I don't agree that it's a breach of human rights.

Most of us love the NHS. But we love it because of what it can give us. This is about what we can give back, not just to the NHS, but to every person that takes medicine anywhere. 

As a data set, what the NHS provides is a better source than ANYWHERE in the world a comprehensive centralised bank of 60 years worth of treatment. 

The sad fact of the matter is that we **we don't know how effective the drugs we are taking are** because the Pharma companies and the Regulators keep the data under lock and key, manipulate the data in dodgy ways, discard studies that have failed, recruit unrepresentative test subjects and a myriad of other ways to sell drugs and obfuscate the efficacy of their products and have done since forever. 

This is the opportunity for academics to actually test those substances that are prescribed. To compare them against each other. To work out what are the best treatments and which are actually causing harm. 

The benefit, not just to us, but to humanity of this is immense. 

It is as anonymous as it needs to be without making the data unusable.

If you are interested in why the NHS is a great data set and how Pharma makes a mockery of medical trials, read [Bad Pharma.](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bad-Pharma-How-Medicine-Broken/dp/000749808X) 

I am pleased this is an opt out rather than opt in. If it were to be opt in, then a) no one would and b) those that did would represent a skewed sample. 

If you are that paranoid, opt out. If you don't like evidence based medicine, opt out. 

But if you care about the health of your fellow man, stay in.

This is anecdotal and I can't comment, though I don't deny that some police officers, like some individuals in any group in a position of trust and power, do abuse the power they have.

&gt; Man I love Robbie Fowler, but this is not enough. I can't accept that the trauma he caused to Le Saux can just be cast aside as him being naive. The wrongs you do stay with you for rest of your life, an ""apology"" can't fix it. He needs to make a bigger gesture than an apology.
I understand that he can't change what he did in past but at least he can come out against the culture of ""Men's Club"" in football and do something about it.
He caused a human being incredible grief. He has to make up for it and he is in a situation where he can make the difference. He can the the visibility that some regular person can't.


Here are few excerpts from that article.

&gt; I stayed on the turf to get treatment and by then Robbie was standing ten yards away. The ball was in front of me, ready for the free kick. I looked at Robbie. He started bending over and pointing his backside in my direction. He looked over his shoulder and started yelling at me. He was smirking. ‚ÄúCome and give me one up the a***,‚Äù he said, repeating it three or four times.

&gt;I was consumed with thoughts of vengeance. I could not calm down. I ran to the halfway line and tried to confront Robbie. I told him my family was in the stand. ‚ÄúBollocks to your family,‚Äù he said. In his autobiography, Robbie wrote that I ran up to him and shouted ‚Äúbut I‚Äôm married‚Äù and he replied ‚Äúso was Elton John, mate‚Äù. It is a nice line and makes him look funny, which is the most important thing to him, but he used dramatic licence. He did not say that.

&gt;Kevin Keegan was the manager (of England) and he wanted us to stage a public reconciliation for the press. I said immediately that unless Robbie said sorry, that was not going to happen. I did not want a public apology, just a private word would do. But he refused. He said that he had done nothing wrong, that it was just a bit of a laugh.

I'm not for one second rubbishing our other wingers, but Lennon has a greater impact on games aside from his pace with the ball.  His runs when he doesn't have the ball distract defenders, and defenders are scared of facing up to attackers who have pace.  Also it has to be said that when Townsend played on the right, as an inverted winger we offered no threat from the ball crossed into from the right.

true,english-rose87,null,null,"As far as I can work out it is essentially doing 2 things, bringing all your medical records together and enabling a larger view of the state of the nations health.

Bringing all your records together is a good thing, particularly in an emergency situation. Example; one morning you wake up feeling unwell, you go and see your GP and they prescribe something. Later that day you collapse while out. You are alone and don't have your drugs prescribed with you. You are rushed to hospital. At the moment if the hospital tried to access your records they may not show the visit from earlier and you are then treated with something that reacts with what you have already taken and makes everything worse. In the future the integrated system will mean when they look you up this is shown and more appropriate treatment can be given. It will also help in spotting patterns of behaviour and make it easier to identify at risk patients.

As for sharing it with researchers. Say a researcher is looking into specific types of drugs and the effect they have. While looking at their research they notice something in their patients that seems potentially significant - people who are taking drug A seem to be showing a higher risk of complication B. But they do not know if this is due to the specific types of people currently on the trial who may share a higher propensity for that risk anyway. So what should they do? In the future they will be able to go to that nationwide database and look at everyone taking, orvwho has taken, drug A and see if their findings are an anomoly or significant. This could potentially save lives. It will also help in longer term case studies, showing if there are risks to taking certain things long term, an example mightbe HRT.

Consider the case of Thaladomide. It took years for people to get sufficient evidence to get the drug banned. Had there been a linked databse it could have been discovered sooner.

For very good reason. One being effectively heavy machinery, the other being a basic device that is a fraction (many fractions) less dangerous.

As ChuckFH points out many (86% if u believe one stat) of cyclists hold a driving licence. 



And apart from the cycling up the left of traffic im not sure a test/licence would serve any benefit as the most common criticisms of cyclists are jumping lights and cycling on the pavement. And you don't need a licence to tell you that you are breaking the highway code when you do such things.

there is an opinion in this country that roads are dangerous, and to use them you should be fully trained and expect and put up with whatever the road throws at you.

Meanwhile, ethanol causes impaired brain development, Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome, Mouth/throat cancers, Anemia, Liver Cirrosis and Hepatitis, Increased risk of diabetes 2, Chronic Gastritis, Pancreatitis, a huge variety of psychological problems etc. Ethanol is more calorie dense and more chemically addictive. 

Excess consumption of ethanol causes far worse problems for that individual than excess consumption of fructose (and all sugar). However, excess food intake is more widespread than excess alcohol intake, which skews perception of the actual consumption risk.

Almost as hard on the liver, yes.  Did you watch the section on how each is metabolised by the liver?  It might be a slight exaggeration on my part, but it's basically the point he's making - without fibre, fructose hits the liver and does damage...

&gt;Meanwhile, ethanol causes impaired brain development, Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome, Mouth/throat cancers, Anemia, Liver Cirrosis and Hepatitis, Increased risk of diabetes 2, Chronic Gastritis, Pancreatitis, a huge variety of psychological problems etc. Ethanol is more calorie dense and more chemically addictive. 

Most of these are non liver effects and therefore irrelevant to my point; those that are liver effects are largely mirrored by sugar.

Edit:  If we are talking other effects of course, excessive sugar is likely equally or more responsible for insulin resistance and type II diabetes, it can also lead to dental caries, coronary heart disease, obesity, hypertension, kidney disease, and it is currently being suggested that it is equally as much of a concern regarding health problems as tobacco and alcohol.

One, the phrase, ""You never forget your first doctor,"" exists for a reason. People who came into the series with 11 will probably like him more.

Two, as far as the look of the show goes, RTD recognized that part of the cult following the pre-2005 Doctor Who had was because of its low-budget look. He decided to keep a big of that around. Moffat, not so much. 

Three, and this one's gonna be controversial, but, if you're an American, stay out of it. Doctor Who is a BBC show. Not BBC America, and certainly not CBS, ABC, or FOX. Now, while the US has recently become obsessed, and that has helped the shows longevity, the deciding factor about whether or not this show lives is in the hands of the British. Right now, they don't like Moffat. The think his writings gotten worse, his plots are full of a million wholes that they try to tie together in episodes that are far too short for all the content forced into them, and that his arrangement of the seasons (when everything airs) makes everyone a little restless. Don't believe me, just look at the Telegraph, or any number of other British media sites. Furthermore, they complain that the Doctor is becoming too Americanized. That, alone, is a terrifying thought. I mean, look what happened to Torchwood when they collaborated with an American production company; we got Miracle Day. 

My personal opinion is that Moffat is capable of AMAZING stories. The ones he put out as stand-alones under RTD were incredible, and still some of my favourites. But, as head writer and executive producer, I feel like the quality of his story-telling has dropped. I do agree with the Brits that there tends to be a lot of details that are just never resolved, left for ""later"" to be crammed in at the last second. I mean, that's mostly what this last Christmas special was, resolution of about 80% of things that had just been left during the last 3 seasons. But, again, as an American, I trust that the BBC can handle their flagship all on their own. They've been doing it a heck of a lot longer than I've been watching it.

This was a long time ago and a different era of football. Not condoning it, but it was that it was. He was in his early 20's in a very patriarchal England. Robbie along with the rest of the young players in that era were rowdy. Every team had players like that and some where faaaaaaaar worse than Robbie. The old schools know what I'm talking about. Homophobia was rife not only in football, but in life in general as it was across the world. I used to be extremely homophobic when I was in my younger years and had utter joy telling gay jokes with my friends to go along with my utter disdain for anything homosexual. I would be lying if I said when fighting people who I knew were gay or bisexual that their sexuality didn't have any extra incentive on some of my punches. (*sigh* Yes, I was a shitbag) Now, I'm a member of the NYC gay soccer team as one of the few straight players and love every single minute of it and a staunch supporter for gay rights. There are times when I reflect on my past and just become ashamed of who I was but that's life and I hope it haunts me for the rest of my life honestly.

In hindsight Robbie shouldn't have done it and regrets is actions, but if anybody tells me that they're exactly the same person now when they were in their early 20's, I would say that's an extremely exuberant answer. Besides, Robbie certainly paid for his comments with LeSaux smashing the back of his head with a deliberate elbow but nobody talks about that. Robbie had it coming thought so fair enough. But if there are any positives in this incident, it's that we can show were football was at that time and of how much better we can become as a society in gay rights. Hitzlsperger isn't the type of man we would associate as gay in football, but I hope that changes a lot of attitudes on and off the pitch. We all makes mistakes, its what we do after that counts.

&gt; New figures published by the NHS support Federation this week prove that the government‚Äôs NHS changes are resulting in increased outsourcing. Nearly 200 contracts, worth ¬£2.5billion in total, have been offered since April. The surge in tenders is one of the first signs that the government‚Äôs rules on competition are opening up more of the NHS to the market.

&gt; The biggest contract so far is worth over a billion pounds and is to provide community services in Cambridgeshire. Seven other areas have similar contracts in the pipeline. The contracts will attract interest from the big corporate players like Serco and Virgin, who have both already scooped up sizable deals in this area.

&gt; Those opposed to NHS ‚Äúmarkets‚Äù worry that the NHS just cannot compete effectively for contracts against private providers.

&gt; Our figures bear out the reality of these fears. Out of the twenty four clinical contracts that have been awarded since April only 4 have gone to the NHS. If the trends continue, huge levels of outsourcing are certain. **This is the mechanism by which our health service will gradually be privatized.**",0,1389301219,null,0,false,0,celkbii,t3_1utjew,t1_celkbii,t3_1utjew,null,1431872598,20,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,20

If Gerrard is playing then Lucas will struggle because neither of them are mobile really, there's just too much ground for him to cover on his own.  Whenhe has the more energetic Allen (or Henderson but he's been playing a little further up with Lucas/Allen behind him) he doesn't have to worry as much about covering both sides of the midfield and he's more free to be effective.  Lucas is an incredibly intelligent player and his positioning is excellent.  All the positioning in the world can't make up for some good old fashion pace sometimes, especially if the breakdown come in an area that he's not currently occupying already.

M'Vila on the other hand is very athletic and physically imposing compared to Lucas.  He covers much more ground which will make him able to protect our back 4 a bit better when we have more static players like Gerrard in the middle.  He doesn't read the game extremely well and really is more an enforcer than a disciplined and intelligent DM, but he's also quite technically gifted for a player in his position.  He's fairly versatile too, he can play a more box to box role if needed and distribute the ball pretty well.

To be honest I wouldn't mind seeing them both play together with Lucas sitting and M'Vila playing as a tenacious box to box midfielder and then have Gerrard or Henderson in front of them.

Minor point, but I have to disagree on this bit. Firstly, [it's pretty well-established that the vast majority of UK cyclists are also drivers](https://www.eta.co.uk/2013/05/24/more-cyclists-pay-road-tax-than-car-drivers/), owning their own cars at home - just preferring not to use them sometimes. The ""two tribes at war"" thing is ridiculously silly, I myself enjoy both riding and driving and try to do both carefully and considerately. This applies to almost all cyclists.

Secondly, for many drivers, the highway code is skim-read as theory test prep and never touched again. Not saying that doesn't apply to cyclists too, but for those of us who commute every day by bike, the scary nature of sharing roads with heavy traffic - and all these HGV deaths - has made many of us examine the rules very carefully and evaluate whether our own habits are safe.  
Those of us who do it every day are fairly seasoned - [against all the odds we have learned to regularly fit into a hostile environment](http://www.reddit.com/r/ukbike/comments/17hwvy/do_not_base_policies_about_cycling_on_the_views/). That's why it's so skewed towards young, fit, well-off males at the moment - we're mad enough to still not want to give up and just add to a traffic jam. For cycling to become safe enough for families to go to school and more ordinary people to nip to the shops, [we need separated bike paths that are so safe that the Highway Code doesn't matter because you never have to mix with fast, heavy motor traffic.](http://aseasyasridingabike.wordpress.com/) Copy the Dutch road designs with segregated space!

Knowing that Chris routinely turns down returning roles, it's entirely possible that the role was presented as a gesture only (we know you won't take this, but we have to offer it to you anyway because you were one of the reboot Doctors and ideally, we'd like all three of you in the special).  It's entirely possible that Moffat was, in fact, planning the special we got from the beginning, especially since he knew Chris's reputation.

My point is and will always be this: we cannot create theories based on casting that fell through, regardless of how wonderful it would have been.  The fact of the matter is that Chris was NOT the War Doctor.  He might have been, in an alternate universe, but he's not in this one.  Theories should be based on the casting that actually happened.

true,gomez12,null,null,"I agree with the top comment there, so I'll just copy-paste some of it here:

&gt;Those of us like Dr Chand who 'long in the tooth' have had direct experience of how things have changed with the NHS. As a ex employee I would disagree that the freeze in pay is a problem, as Agenda for Change bandings raised salaries for most people. Doctors have done well in pay rounds under Blair. Staff values of why people work in health or care have moved towards the general population 'I have to look after me and mine first' model. So they forget the pay of most working elsewhere in insecure jobs is abyssmal.

Agreed. Despite a pay freeze, the NHS still pays comparatively well and has generous benefits compared to the private sector. 

&gt;The NHS should not be a sacred cow and people who use it who have poor / dangerous care must be allowed to speak up publicly, to name staff. There is no other way to ensure standards rise.

Agreed also. The NHS isn't the best in the world, yet we worship it like it's untouchable. It's just healthcare. It's a public service that we pay huge amounts of tax towards, and we should demand that it performs as well as possible. 

If we protest all changes, we'd still have a system from the 1950's. The NHS was always intended to be a dynamic, changing organisation. In 1949 the NHS budget was the equivalent of ¬£9bn. Now it is ¬£130bn. Consecutive yearly 7% budget increases under Labour had very little effect on patient care. The money was simply absorbed into the system and didn't really improve things at all. So why should we keep aimlessly pouring money into the bottomless pit of the NHS, especially if it isn't delivering the results we expected from it? 

I don't see what's wrong with demanding efficiency savings. We can't keep pouring that much money in willy nilly.

Brink of extinction - what a load of bullshit. The NHS got ¬£500m more last year than the year before, which is basically a freeze if you account for inflation and population growth. That's not a brutal cut.

* *How happy are you in your job?* Pretty happy when I get to the technical parts. Less enthused by the process parts that come with being civil servant. 

* *What training / experience did you need to get it?* I have a BSc in broadcast engineering stuff, and worked for a few years in the UK in technology for policing. 

* *What does it pay (if you are comfortable revealing)?* enough for me to leave the country and work elsewhere. 

* *Where are you in the country (again if comfortable revealing)?* In one of the colonies. 

* *Are you good at it?* Yupe. But that's in part my prior experience, and part because I'm allowed to do what I need to do (with in reason) to get the job done.  My colleagues seem OK with what I do for them, and I'm the only person that can do those things.  

* *Does it require any specific personality traits?* Good digital chops. Good research ability. Good problem solving.

That isn't a trend that will reverse until the aging population we face ceases to continue along that line. Efficiency Savings are one of the most laughable euphemisms ever created when describing healthcare spending: what they are is real terms cuts (relative to the increasing cost of healthcare) that result in real losses in healthcare outcomes. 

We spend a phenomenally low share of our GDP for a very good value return in terms of healthcare outcomes, and that is a share of GDP that will either increase with the demographic shift, or shrink and result in lower healthcare outcomes. 

But that is not why it is on the brink of extinction. It is on the brink of extinction because the long term trends that can be extrapolated from the details and results of coalition policy is that it's service provision will become increasingly loss-making to the point where, as a healthcare provision entity, the NHS will cease to exist, and be replaced by private companies. When this has become the case, the next logical step is for government funding for contracts for these private companies should be replaced by an insurance system.

The NHS has room to improve, it is no sacred cow, but it is a very efficient system by comparison to most, and the Health and Social care act poses a very real threat threat to it's long term viability.

There were periods where he just fucked off to Argentina without the club's permission or complete understanding of when he'd return (once he told the media he wasn't planning on going back, and once he threatened retiring from club football altogether if City forced his hand).

His later time at City was rather defined by obvious disdain towards City management, and there were so many reports of ""clear the air"" meetings and BS ""I'm happy at City"" pullquotes that it kept getting more and more tiresome and unbelievable. And dealing with Tevez meant we had to deal with that Joorbacian fellow, which along with the constant hemming and hawing, unexplained absences, trash-talking about the manager, never even attempting to learn English, made it damned near impossible to get a fair value for him in the transfer market. There were rumors he wanted to return to Boca and that we were willing to help financially to make that a possibility, but he wasn't willing to accept the still-significant disparity in salary. Additionally, I think I remember hearing that the Sheikh had allowed him use of a private jet to go between Argentina and Manchester after he complained of homesickness and was dealing with some issues relating to his family.

No, people paint him that way because he did not get on with Wenger, Mancini, Deschamps, Mourinho, and AVB. One manager doesn't like you, OK I get it. Not everyone gets along. Two manager? It happens, there are some types out there. Three? Are you having a life crisis?! After the fourth, it's hard not to say that a pattern emerges.

What is more telling is how his teammates describe him. You said so yourself

&gt;The most telling thing about Adebayor I have seen was the tunnel video for the Man City shit show this season. Adebayor comes in and is greeting people left and right, handshakes, high fives, smiles all around, not just to Man City players but the nameless people in the tunnel who work for City in some capacity.

But from teammate biographies, he carries this on after a game is lost. Most players are upset or angry after losing a game. This is what you want from anyone in any profession, at least if you want to be the best. If I don't do well on a project at work, I am angry at myself because I know I could do better. Not that my life ends, but I get upset so that I can drive myself to higher peaks. Adebayor seems to be missing this hunger. He has the skill, everyone knows it.

Luckily for us, that's *not* true. The Netherlands went through a huge car-centric roadbuilding boom in the sixties just like we did, and people started to be killed in greater and greater numbers, particularly children playing in formerly safe residential streets. There were serious proposals to fill in Amsterdam's canals with concrete to provide more room for traffic...

...and then people started demanding a different approach. Please watch this: [How the Dutch got their cycling paths](http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2011/10/how-dutch-got-their-cycling.html) 

I firmly believe we can do the same in the UK. The wheels are actually already in motion, which is why cycling safety is such a repeated topic on /r/uk at the moment. People are unhappy and already demanding change - the roads aren't working well for anybody at the moment, even drivers. But it's about more than bikes - pedestrians too - keeping minor roads for people and not cars, with traffic kept at a safe distance on major routes. The system works better for everybody, including drivers.

It took the Dutch ten years before the government listened and implemented widespread segregation as standard. I think it's early days so far, but I for one have given my MP an earful about road planning and needless death on more than one occasion. And in the past three years some really great signs of progress have started to come out of local governments and transport planners...

Siggy has more technical skill in terms of his shot but isn't particularly skilled in much else.

He is a CAM who should sit behind the striker and be asked to shoot. We continue to put him on the outside where he has no skills that are suited to play on the wing effectively wasting the skills that he does have.  He is not overly creative, lacks pace, is an average passer and not a great defender.  He is very controlled and has good discipline.

Holtby may not have as good a shot as Siggy but is probably equal or better on the other skills. Though is less controlled and disciplined than Siggy.

Between the two of them Holtby probably makes more sense to keep around as Siggy doesn't bring enough to the game as a winger and we don't/haven't utilized the type of CAM/support striker role that he would be very useful in.  Holtby on the other hand can help for depth in a CM, CAM or B2B role.

Truth is, with the players we have both Holtby and Siggy are seemingly down the pecking order in the middle of the pitch, which is where they would both be suited to play which makes both (unfortunately as i really do like both players) potential loan/sale bait.",0,1389308400,null,0,false,0,celnr96,t3_1uttg0,t1_celnr96,t1_celmvgf,null,1431874217,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

 I am older than you. My experience of the police is extensive. I have served one sentence. 9 months in 85 have'nt served another one since. The arresting officer was later convicted of conspiracy to supply Heroin DC Kelly.

43 POLICE FORCES THROUGHOUT THE UK HAD OFFICERS FACING DISHONESTY CHARGES AND CORRUPTION - as stated in a 'TIMES SURVEY ' and the Home Secretary at the time - Jack Straw - said this alarming situation of crooked police posed a great risk to justice.  Many of the charges concerned drugs, misuse of police information, perverting the course of justice and assaults.  The survey revealed that it just didn't occur at constable level with a few sergeants, it also mentioned superintendents, chief inspectors and high ranking detectives.  In the light of this they said a new unit was to be formed called CIB3, and that would be assigned to root out corruption.  Ten years on -- and there has been no significant cases as a result of these findings

Police Commissioner Paul Condon with his elite anti-corruption squad rooted out twenty detectives after discovering malpractice in the Met.  The activities of these officers included fraud, drug allegations, misbehaviour and impropriety.
Court 6 was busy with four un-named cops on trial.

Court 8 was busy with DETECTIVE CONSTABLE AUSTIN WARNES who admitted conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, his co-defendants were in court 6.  Warnes was accused of a plot to plant drugs on a mother so that the husband could get custody of their sons.

Court 11 was busy with POLICE CONSTABLE DAVID EVANS, DETECTIVE CONSTABLE CHRISTOPHER CARTER, and DETECTIVE CONSTABLE LEONARD GERRARD all charged with the theft of ecstasy tablets. The drugs with a street value of ¬£500,000 (40,000 tablets), were to be sold on the streets to junkies and pushers.

Court 17 was busy with POLICE CONSTABLE ANDREW WIGLEY and POLICE CONSTABLE SIMON WILSON, both charged with aggravated assault and attempting to pervert the course of justice.  Wigley was accused of helping Wilson to cover up the crime by falsifying his notes.

Court 18 was busy with POLICE CONSTABLE RICHARD SAMS and WOMAN POLICE CONSTABLE PATRICIA McGOVERN who were charged with false imprisonment and attempting to pervert the course of justice.  They are said to have stopped a motorist late at night and said he was in the bus lane.  An arrest followed in which Constable Sams assaulted the man occasioning actual bodily harm. This latter charge was added to the other charges the constable faced.

So, for example, there are numerous circumstances where the NHS may take a wait and see approach, whereas the US system may go down a much more aggressively interventionist route.

It is puzzling that you should think most cyclists are drivers but few drivers are cyclists.

For one thing - bicycles are *much* cheaper than cars - so it would be reasonable to conclude that most people learned to cycle before learning to drive!

I would be very surprised to learn that there are many drivers that have never used a bicycle before.

Outside the niche world of cycling, nobody really cares about the safety of adult cycle commuters. But it's a national disgrace that children die on the roads outside their homes because of traffic levels. It's a national disgrace that parents feel the only safe way to get them to school is to drive them there because of dangerous roads.  
The literal Dutch translation of the protest group was ""Stop the Child Murder"". A bit grating, but to them it was still very new and horrifying to think children weren't safe playing outside. We have become dehumanised to road deaths: we think they are somehow unavoidable. If airline flights were somehow killing plenty of children on the ground below every year, would it be OK? I think not, Heathrow would be shut within hours. So why is that OK on our roads?

The key to change in NL was getting parents involved in wanting quiet, safe streets. I passionately believe the UK would be a better place if we had that too.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"&gt; If Siggy isn't going to play this season, I'm sure Swans would love to take him back for another spell on loan.

I think Laudrop actually said today that Swans need to bring in 2 players on loan than can have the impact that Siggy did when he was on loan.

I like Siggy but he is very much along the same lines as Dempsey in that we just don't play in a manner (that we have seen) where his skills will ever actually be used effectively.  It makes him a square peg in a round hole for us.

Holtby's skills may be easier to come across than Siggy's, but he is also better suited to be used in our way of playing.

The thing that has me slightly weary about all of this would be the idea of calling Carroll back from loan and sending either (or both) Siggy/Holtby out on loan.  Carroll has potential to be very good but needs regular time to progress and just like Siggy/Holtby he will be down the pecking order in our midfield.  It would make more sense to keep Siggy/Holtby in house and have them play while Carroll is getting regular minutes for QPR and then make decisions in the Summer one who stays/goes when we determine if Sherwood is the manager or we opt for someone like LVG.

Ok first of all he has only played one or two games for us as a deep-lying playmaker - The game vs Anzhi stands out where he played very well.

Bristol is cycle friendly and you can get a train from Temple Meads or Bristol Park Way to Bath station without too much issue - probably takes about half an hour. Car takes about half an hour though I can't promise anything when it comes to getting snarled up in rush hour.

2 - Neither will be that cheap, Bristol being a city and Bath being rather posh. If you want bars go for Bristol.

3 - I went to uni in Bath. There is, but it more an old pubs kind of place. Heading to Bistol was fairly common but I never really bothered, basically by train though people would occasionally hire coaches if they got enough people for it to be worth it. If bars are important go for Bristol.

4 - http://www.theclimbingacademy.com/ (think this is the place I've been to) All bouldering gym.

5 - After tax? Biggest expense is likely to be rent, do you live in the UK now? How much other than rent do you need to live comfortably now?

true,IUsedToBeZed22,newcr-5,"Columbus Crew SC, Everton, Sky Blue FC","My passion for Everton started when Landon Donovan, then my favorite USMNT player, was loaned to them back in 2010. But since you're Canadian, that might not work for you. So let me tell you about my friend.

A friend-of-a-friend of mine in college used to play a bunch of FIFA, but he never really watched many matches. As he got more into playing, he started watching Everton with me. He liked the club culture, he loved Goodison Park, he liked rooting for an underdog that sometimes scrapped it's way to the top. But what made him fall madly in love with Everton were the songs.

One week, he comes over to my suite in the dorms and he's clapping and singing [Forever Everton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5t842UuBlw) at the top of his lungs (and mind you, this was in California, so it was like 5 in the morning or something). He said he'd discovered a trove of old songs for the team, and just *felt something.* And immediately I knew what he meant.

Evertonians have a bunch of sayings about the club, but one that always sticks out to me is ""Once Everton has touched you, nothing will be the same."" It's how he felt the first time he heard that crackly old recording of Forever Everton. It's how I felt the first time I watched as the crowd roared, welcoming the mighty blues out of the tunnel, with the Theme from Z Cars playing through the stadium. It's the way, even if you're not an Evertonian, watching Jags knock in that penalty in the FA Cup Semifinal fills you with something indescribable.

For some, the club doesn't click this way. And I get that. But for many of us, falling in love with our Toffees was just like falling in love with a woman, a man, a city, a college, a food. It happens all at once, and it never leaves you.

So what do I suggest? Watch us play a few matches. Watch interviews with Roberto Martinez, our beloved manager, and see how his eyes glow when he talks about this team. Read up on our history, and see how we rose from being kicked off our field by a wealthy douchebag who went on to found Liverpool FC to the massive club we are today. Give us a chance, and we might steal your heart.

And it's not elitism. I didn't say it to imply that nationality of one person or another mattered. I said it to imply that where the funding comes from matters. The funding is from the BBC. If the show every goes downhill in the British eye, like it did around Doctor #6, it's popularity in America really won't matter, not unless their willing to move the entire operation state-side and possibly let an American studio take over. In which case, as is our way, we'll either (a) milk it until it brakes or (b) cancel it immediately (lookin' at you, FOX). 

I'm just saying, up until now, Doctor Who has been so very British, and that's how it got it's following in the first place. I just don't know that Americanizing it to a substantial amount would leave us with the Doctor we love.

We may not have the same budget as other teams but that just means we have to work and develop our own talent, not ship it in from somewhere else. And if you want to know if we're good at that, have a look at [Seamus Coleman](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6URMIvfAyss) who we bought for ¬£60,000 and people are calling the best right back in the premier league or [Ross Barkley](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykMmPvFcRwQ), who came out of our academy and is being hailed as the best English talent to emerge in years.

As for why to support Everton, I would say that we are pretty unique in the EPL. We're known as a family club, and often players talk about how much they enjoy their time playing at Everton. Our chairman is an Everton fan since childhood, pretty unusual since basically all the teams around us are owned by foreign oil tycoons and businessmen. 

The club also has a unique relationship with it's fans, I'm not sure if you know about it, but our badge got changed recently from [this](http://www.creativereview.co.uk/images/uploads/2013/10/evertonoldcrest_0_0.jpg) to [this](http://www.toffeeweb.com/images/homepage/teams/everton-new.jpg). The fans hated it and started a petition, and the club actually listened. Despite already paying for the new badge on the side of the stadium etc, Everton actually let the fans decide what the badge should look like, and so from next season [this](http://i2.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article6078105.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/EVERTON_Option_1_Crest_Main_RGB-6078105.jpg) will be our badge. I don't know many clubs that would go to that effort just to please the fans.

You're right, but I think you have misunderstood his point.

Everyone I know knows how to ride a bike, but that does not mean they ride it on the roads, or ride it in busy traffic....or ride it daily. Most people use a bike once or twice a year, round a park or similar. 

Ultimately we know most regular cyclist are drivers too, the same cannot be said for drivers as a whole past riding round the park.

&gt;Several people right here on Reddit have argued it and the only thing they've yet come up with is ""Nuh uh, because I don't like it."" 
Just like you have.

That is UNTRUE and you know it. This is not about dismissing it because we don‚Äôt like it. We are just holding to the canon which you are seeking to ignore in favor of some stupid joke made on another show.

So in your view a joke made on the Jeffersons somehow overrides eight years of continuity on All in the Family? That‚Äôs the case you‚Äôre making here.

WHY do you cling to the notion that a JOKE made on a SPIN OFF program somehow negates DECADES of canon including the most recently aired episode?????

When this was first brought up on the show it was said that after the 12th regeneration no plans can postpone death (not the 507th).

The 5th Doctor states that he can regenerate 12 times (not 507). He also said eight of them, eight of me (not eight of them, five hundred of me).

Azmeal forces a 13th regeneration because he knows it will kill him (which would not be the case if he had 485 more)

The 8th Doctor said a Time Lord has 13 lives (not 508).

In the last aired episodes that Doctor says ‚ÄúNo, not forever. I can change 12 times. Thirteen versions of me. Thirteen silly doctors‚Äù. He did NOT say he could change 507 times or there would be 508 silly doctors.

I and others have proven to you several times that you are wrong about the 507 thing being anything but a JOKE, a flippant remark, something that was never meant to be taken seriously, and NEVER meant to override existing canon. You are doing a disservice to new fans by stubbornly clinging to this erroneous notion.

Unless you can present a really compelling case that we should disregard 50 years of canon in favor of a line in a spin off show,  then you need to stop all this ""507 is canon"" nonsense.

It started off as a joke that he reacted negatively to. In that environment, any weakness is going to be latched onto. It could have been anything, not even necessarily a societal taboo, and if he'd reacted negatively to it he'd have had the piss taken out of him for that.

Contrast Le Saux's response to abuse with Fowler's and you'll see the difference in personalities. That's the cause of the issue rather than any sort of genuine homophobia.

* Gylfi Sigurdsson - 14 matches, 3 goals on 27 shots, 55% shot accuracy, 83% passing accuracy.

* Andros Townsend - 14 matches, 1 goal on 46 shots, 53% shot accuracy, 85% passing accuracy.

* Lewis Holtby - 12 matches, 1 goal on 20 shots, 40% shot accuracy, 82% passing accuracy.

* Nacer Chadli - 12 matches, 0 goals on 17 shots (2 assists, though), 15% shot accuracy, 84% passing accuracy.

* Erik Lamela - 9 matches, 0 goals on 8 shots (1 assist, though), 40% shot accuracy, 80% passing accuracy.

Those are some relevant stats for offensive players.

That being said, it's very much not black-and-white. While Siggy has produced more goals, Holtby has produced **WAY** more chances than any of that lot, and he gets back on defense much better. Then again, Lamela and Townsend have been dribbled against more than any of this five with Chadli and Sigurdsson being the least. Townsend is crazy fast, even though he tends to keep holding R2 when he shoots and bang up the rafter lighting. Chadli's stats don't appear good as a goal scorer or a passer, and his crosses have only been successful about 18% of the time. His assists help, though. And, Lamela...well, Lamela doesn't have any stats to really speak to positively **yet**, but everyone knows he's a project in development.

In summary, my point was that Gylfi has had good production so far; not that he has more upside. He was also our 5th highest goal scorer last season in all comps with 7; behind Bale (26), Defoe (15), Dempsey (12), and Adebayor (8). In a team that needs goals (thankfully now slightly less than a month ago), it's hard to say he's the weakest. (Disclaimer: Lamela, Chadli, and Townsend obviously didn't play for Spurs last year and Holtby came in January. The goal scoring from last year was just to emphasis his strength, not to compare him to the other four.)

**Edit**: Formatting and spelling.

**Edit 2**: Isn't it weird to think that our top three goal scorers from last year are all gone (if you include Defoe going to Toronto) and the 4th only getting in the mix as of late?

The answer is not to be obstructionist and try to maintain a good but doomed system. We need to find a way to avoid privatisation while maintaining the universality of coverage. The NHS as it is is not sustainable with the increase in the cost of medical treatments and an ageing population. There's no point defending a weak position as it merely gives the opposition an upper hand. A real solution is needed. I wish the Left (Labour basically) would be less reactionary and more progressive in it's rhetoric and maybe I could have something to support. It is a non-sequitur to assume you can make your point by merely disproving the other side - it's logically invalid - make a positive argument. Yes, privatisation will be a disaster; so face the current problems and give us a new solution.

It's tough to make any finalized decisions about a show with a run that portends to be unending, they had no choice but to ""soften"" the concept of their ""marriage"". Sure they teased us with the concept of ""the Doctor's Wife"", and as disappointed as I was that it turned out to be mostly smoke and mirrors, the truth is it could never have been something so legitimate. This is the Doctor we're talking about, after all.

That said, however, he DID tell her he loved her- which is unprecedented for the Doctor, even with Rose Tyler. And even this was whispered off-the-record and only heavily implied, because, again, this is unprecedented, and to break such revolutionary ground with the character, THAT would make Moffat guilty of the presumptuousness of which everyone accuses him. 

The Doctor can't be tied down with the finality that a Real Marriage would imply, not when the show is so (hopefully) far from its end. To do so would take malleability out of the hands of future writers and show-runners.

And so, River's life had to revolve around the Doctor. This is the only explanation for her ending up as his ""wife"" in any context other than whimsy (i.e. Queen Elizabeth) besides concrete, finalizing reality. As cheated as we may feel, the idea of the Doctor having a ""real"" wife is best left to fanfiction, or *perhaps* the shows' final series.

For every 250,000 people you need a height vehicle within 10 minutes ride etc. etc.

&gt; ""Helen Grant, minister with responsibility for the First World War commemorations recently met the high commissioners from New Zealand and Australia to discuss our plans.

&gt; ""We are clear that Britain could not have prevailed without the contribution of our Commonwealth partners and our plans for the centenary will fully reflect that.""

&gt; New Zealand Arts, Culture and Heritage minister Chris Finlayson **said the Telegraph report was not accurate**.

&gt; ""I have had a number of discussions ... [with the British Government] and there is a high level of recognition of the contribution of New Zealand and a desire from Britain and other countries that New Zealand does its bit to tell its story.""

&gt; All Commonwealth countries wanted their contributions recognised and the British were conscious of that.

&gt; ""Where I think the wires may have been crossed is that there is ... a lot of interest from former colonies of Britain that contributed, take for example Nepal, or India ... and various people are saying we need to be mindful of this contribution or that contribution and I think that is totally correct.""

&gt; This did not mean ignoring New Zealand, Australia or Canada.

The most expensive piece of medical equipment available in 1945 were incubators and some basic xray machines. Surgery was significantly more dangerous and the techniques used were much lower tech. These days we can grow entire organs in a lab from stem cells and insert them using expensive equipment to keep patients alive. We can scan people in a variety of ways most using machines that cost millions and millions of pounds to buy and lots to maintain. MRI machines need to be cooled with liquid helium which is quickly becoming scarce and expensive. As we grow old and the NHS has the capability to stave off the effects of old age with medical procedures most of which did not exist or would have killed an elderly patient in the 50s everything becomes more and more expensive. Drugs are more expensive and there are much much more of them to prescribe. The equipment and it's maintenance is more expensive.

true,strolls,null,null,"I think there's disagreement over what the NHS is. 

It used to be that the NHS was this big organisation which owned hospitals and x-ray machines up and down the country, and who contracted with local practices and consultants to provide services to all of us.

Now the NHS is the means - the ""business process"", as it were - by which the state provides free heathcare to the citizens of this country.

It was that second part before, too, but now it's *only* this second part - the ownership of hospitals and x-ray machines has gone, as these have been released as semi-independent ""trusts"", which can go bankrupt or make a little profit, and which are required to compete with private providers, too.

The problem with this, as I see it, is that the people, through the state, no longer own these resources. With the state buying services from ""hospital trusts"", the state is now in a position to advocate about who gets free healthcare and who doesn't, on the basis that there's now not enough money to go around. 

There is a big difference in narrative between ""there's not enough hospitals and the state provides all the hospitals"" and ""there's not enough money to buy healthcare for everyone on the open market"". In one case the blame would seem to lie with the state for not having enough hospitals, the other is a *shrug-there's-nothing-we-can-do-about-it* fact of life.

Writing this I'm also struck by the fact that these NHS hospital trusts probably have to compete with private providers on different terms. The hospital trust is required to offer certain services which make a loss, whereas the private provider can pick and choose, and reject services which don't offer enough profit.

What will be the result of this? Well, NHS trusts may go bust, and their facilities be purchased by private providers, or they might lobby for less regulation, so they can refuse to offer unprofitable services. This just seems like setting up the dominoes for a privatisation by accident of circumstances.

Was on one form of birth control. Went in for a refill, was told they were switching it. I told them it had been working for me for 10 years without side effects. They said I had no choice, they were switching it anyways. New meds made me sick as fuck. I quit taking birth control completely until I could get out of the country. It might have been free, but free bricks are not helpful when you need bread. 


Have a lump in my back where I pulled a muscle and some tissue has moved around. UK doc told me there was nothing she could do, even with the chronic pain, and maybe if I could afford it I should go see a chiropractor. A chiropractor? Seriously? I don't know how you feel about non-medical personnel playing with your spine when the problem is soft tissue damage, but it freaked me out more than a little. 


Friend's wife just had to have emergency surgery in the US because she went undiagnosed in the UK for 4 years after complaining of pain to 10 doctors. It took a US hospital less than 4 hours to figure out what was wrong and get her scheduled for surgery. The NHS had been telling her to take antacid when she told them she had pain. She nearly died. 


Another friend ended up in tears because her NHS doctor treated her with such contempt. She wasn't a crybaby or a complainer either; she had ovarian cysts and endomitriosis. 


I'm not terribly impressed with the NHS, all told. If you're not elderly, pregnant, or bleeding on their floor, I didn't see a lot of care. Reminded me of the medical care I got in the US military, honestly - I wasn't ever a patient, I was an annoyance that should be gotten rid of as soon as possible. Haven't seen that issue in the US private sector.

The Doctor certainly says that he only has twelve regeneration on a number of occasions. Which would be relevant *if he (and others) didn't then regenerate more than twelve times.* 

**Your entire position, that the regeneration limit is something outside of Time Lord discretion is completely invalidated by the fact that the Time Lords elect to disregard that limit repeatedly.** While the limit is certainly accepted as canon, *the nature of the limit is never addressed.* Where does that limit come from? There is nothing in canon that states that it is anything but a limit imposed by the Time Lords.
