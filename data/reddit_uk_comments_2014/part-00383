**TL;DR: I found Spurs 11 years ago due to luck and a common theme at the time with my other favorite club, the Boston Red Sox.**


Back in the late 90s, the only way you could watch the Premier League in the States was on pay per view cable stations. I lived in Boston and had a black box(steals all the channels) on my cable, so every Saturday or Sunday morning I caught the early game or a replay from the day before (surprisingly one channel over from the Spice Channel, classy!). That's how I first got exposed to football outside of the World Cup.

Fast forward a few years and every game I started to regularly see involved Arsenal. In the 2003-2004 season that featured The Invincibles, I started to realize the scorn I had for them that built up over the years, and the irrationality of its nature. It was similar to the irrational hatred I always had for the Yankees (for obvious reasons, being a life-long Bostonian).

On April 25th, Arsenal clinched the league at White Hart Lane; it was the first time I really noticed the atmosphere at the Lane on my crappy TV as Spurs barely got broadcast at all. Every game I saw over the 4-5 years I started watching as a neutral had Arsenal or United involved 90% of the time.
Watching the supporters at the Lane was awesome. Playing their biggest rivals, the atmosphere was intense, especially with the stakes that were on the line. They were louder than any of the numerous home Arsenal games that cable shoved down my throat. Why wouldn't I be drawn to the biggest rival of the team I've grown to loathe? The rivalry even had the underdoggish/lopsided nature that I'd grown up with my whole life supporting the Red Sox.

When the Conservatives formed a government in 1979 they continued the previous government's policy of controlling inflation. But Thatcher turned control of the money supply into a central plank of government policy. 

By 1981 the government realised that it wasn't working. It was damaging the economy, and damaging the core supporters Thatcher relied on and identified with. Sensibly, the government quietly dropped the policy. Just as sensibly, given the way the media seize on U turns, Thatcher made the famous U-turn speech.

In that war nobody was guilt free, but as we see over and over, *history is written by the victors*.  

I must stress that this is a minority point of view though, and the Croatians I consider to be friends are all very tolerant of Serbs and many of them have been to Serbia and say things like 'Serbians are our brothers'. Football seems to bring out the worst in both sides though, it has to be said.

I have been considering a smaller bike to start with....on the bad roads I would prefer it tbh. i would feel i could pick it up easily and have more fluid controls for pothole avoidance. May even be nicer filtering.

I just know once i get to normal roads I will just get bored, the 125 I trained on got really easy and boring. I like acceleration, I do not care about speed.

Could you recommend a 250 or slightly higher that would be a good start? I am ok with this idea, but would not want to spend a huge amount. 2k max and must be upright.

false,helloindustries,UnionFlag,Midlands - '98 FZS600 [Streetfighter],"* Not liking the look of a type of bike is fine, worrying about how it will look in a carpark is not. It's your bike, you get the one you like. Balls to what others may think of you.

* An adventure style bike does seem like the most practical choice given your circumstances. They can do dirt and they do road stuff about as well as most bikes.

* As for a recommendation: Japanese. Not older than 1995. In good condition and less than 40k miles on the clock. Buy from a shop which offers a warranty on the bike, make sure it's HPI clear and has a service history.

* As for which shop: That depends on your area or if you're willing to travel for a well recommended outlet.

* Gear wise: Do NOT cheap out on a helmet. £200+ is entirely reasonable. Go full face, modular if you want that. HJC do good helmets at reasonable prices. Get one with a pinlock and insert, it'll save you a lot of annoyance, especially this time of year. Wont help with glasses steaming up, though.

* Heated grips might be a good idea, heated gloves are expensive, and thicker winter gloves reduce feel of controls.

* Get leather bike boots which cover the ankles and a good chunk of your shin.

* Bike trousers which are waterproof and can fit over clothes.

* Jacket should also be waterproof and have CE approved armour in the shoulders and elbows as a minimum.

Oxford do some good stuff for a good price, but the best thing is that their returns policy is good, especially if you have unexpected issues with the kit.",0,1418944424,null,0,false,0,cmz1pk8,t3_2pq2nq,t1_cmz1pk8,t1_cmz0wkx,null,1425328112,1,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,1

false,SYSTEM_USER,null,null,"Coal power stations are only up to 45% efficient for reasons of the 2nd law of thermodynamics and engineering practicalities. 

For reasons of fundamental physics, you can't make a power station more than about 60% efficient using current materials (such as flawless single-crystal superalloys).

Energy prices are rising for a number of reasons:
1. Shut down of power stations that operate on cheap coal fuel (as part of an EU directive). Coal is a very cheap fuel - and is especially cheap at the moment, due to low demand in Europe. Even allowing for the lower efficiency of coal plants compared to gas, coal electricity works out substantially cheaper.

2. Construction of power plants which sell electricity at a very high ""strike price""  - e.g. wind power is given a ""strike price"" of £155/MWh, and the Sizewell C plant has been given a ""strike price"" of £92/MWh; compared to a current wholesale electricity price of about £40/MWh.

3. Radical changes in where and how electricity is generated, necessitating massive changes in the electricity grid. Connecting the current crop of new wind farms is going to require an national grid to spend an extra £15 billion on powerlines and substation upgrades over the next 10 years. That works out at about an extra £50 per year on your electricity bill - just to pay for the connections.

4. Increasing difficulty in maintaining and upgrading power grid performance, due to planning restrictions. A new powerline (wooden power poles crossing farmland) has just been constructed between Liverpool and Wigan, to relieve a critical electricity shortage in Wigan. The line was held up in planning for 8 years - 5 years of which, the electricity shortage in Wigan was at ""emergency"" levels meaning that the local electricity distributor could not meet the legal requirements for grid reliability.  Other power distributors are turning to ""novel"" ideas such as giant batteries, or DC undersea cables to relieve grid congestion because the construction of new power lines and/or construction of new substations is nearly impossible.

Do you *really* think 1.6m people talked about something for two years and never considered that oil is a volatile asset?

The consensus was always that oil is a bonus, it's a very nice thing to have but it won't last forever and instead of whatever profits we get from it just disappearing into the UK treasury, funding wars, weapons of mass destruction or tax cuts for people who don't need them we would instead be able to use it to make restructuring the economy for a post-oil world easier, to build out the things we'll need when the oil does go. (Like Renewables which Scotland as vast 'amounts' of)

We know the oil is running out, we know crazy price drops like this happen. I never met a single YES voter who didn't think of the oil as anything more than a precious resource we should be extremely careful with. The idea was always *""If it's there, good, we can use that to help make our country stronger""*. If it wasn't there well we'd deal with those situations as they came up.. that's what being an independent country means.

The current situation would make that harder, obviously. We'd move slower, borrow more heavily and it would all be even harder still had the currency union appeared. Doesn't deter me from independence, Scotland's perfectly capable of dealing with its problems.

Lastly, To even ask this question.. to say they 'saved the country' you have to be of the position that somehow Scotland without will just immediately become some fucked up failed state.

With Moreno, Johnson, or Enrique on the pitch, there is at least one fullback caught in no man's land at any given time. Manquillo and Flanagan are our only ""responsible"" fullbacks, though Enrique is fantastic at charging back after being caught out. I see 3 stay-at-home CBs with Lucas in front of them as the safest we can possibly hope for. Sanchez is going to being exploiting the space left behind our cavalier fullbacks anyways (unless Brendan massively changes his tune and tells them to guard the nest), so I'd rather have more men in the box who can defend crosses and throw themselves in front of shots. On top of that, it frees up one of those would-be fullbacks (see: Markovic on Wed) to attack with impunity rather than sprint up and down the pitch all day doing neither of their jobs particularly well  (see: Johnson and Moreno all season). 

4 players completely devoted to defence (Sakho [pls], Skrtel, Kolo, and Lucas) and 6 to attack, or 3 players completely devoted to defence, 2 doing nothing helpful at either end of the pitch, and 5 to attack.

For the PL as a whole, increased popularity leads to increased TV royalties. Is this likely to happen? Maybe. PL fans are all over and just breaking into the biggest media market in the USA. But - many are predicting that tv rights deals will start to decrease in value as leagues move to non traditional content delivery. The current huge deals are driven by sports networks tying up one of the only reliable source of viewership - live sports. 

For Tottenham in particular you would have to believe that you can either significantly grow the fan base (possible for a very good London based club) or create new revenue streams. Teams like ManU and Real Madrid are doing this by being content creators as well as sports teams. Could Tottenham become more of a multimedia enterprise like those clubs? Maybe. Again, being a very good team based in London helps. 

If I were an investor, those would be the two main areas I'd look at. Of course a new stadium is nice, but that's an incremental improvement. I would want to grow the club into a corporation with more diverse interests that don't fully ride on performance.

It was commissioned with the intent on how to *make libraries better in the future* rather than perhaps the most pertinent question; 'do we need libraries at all given their cost and floundering membership to an ever increasingly small part of the population?'

There is no doubt that libraries service some social and informational need - that much can be realised given the recommendations. However a library should be about a library. If a library is serving secondary purposes (which for many are its primary purposes), that is all well and good but perhaps then it would be better to have something which serves those purposes directly rather than as a means to an end to keep paper relevant. A library is no longer the primary means of circulating information and it is time we stopped pretending it is.

If for example we want 'sofas and coffee' perhaps what is needed is a social hub. If it has books too... great. If it has sofas and wifi, great. If it provides computers and council services like Welfare access, even better. But lets not call it a library. Lets make it somewhere the local community can come together and do whatever they want to do together.

Libraries likely should go.

false,SeekTruthFromFacts,null,null,"Firstly, it makes it harder for everyone to calculate the outcome. From 1945 to the 1990s there was a Uniform National Swing (UNS) which usually meant you could work out the UK-wide results within about 2 seconds of knowing the GB party shares. The fact that Scotland has decoupled from England-and-Wales means everybody has to fight their campaigns differently. For example, Ed Miliband is actually doing quite well in England, but his numbers look atrocious because Labour's doing so badly in Scotland.

Second consideration is the makeup of the House of Commons. Have a look at [this chart of possibilities by Martin Baxter](http://www1.politicalbetting.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/BGround-1.png). [Before the SNP surge](http://www1.politicalbetting.com/index.php/archives/2014/09/02/augusts-politicalbetting-polling-average-labs-recovery-continues/) Labour were on about 35%, Tories on about 32%. [Now](http://www1.politicalbetting.com/index.php/archives/2014/12/06/pbs-november-poll-average-labour-down-again-but-its-others-on-the-up/) Labour are down to about 32%, Cons 31%. So we've slid down the vertical side of the chart from Labour majority, through Labour+Lib Dem or SNP and into Labour+SNP only. Now our first point means the chart isn't completely reliable; it's probably worse for Labour than it seems.

Thirdly, there is a huge difference between a Labour majority government and a Labour-led coalition government. Obviously Mr Miliband would like to implement his policies in full; with a coalition partner he can't. This is especially true if he only has one possible coalition partner. The SNP surge should have made this less likely, but Nick Clegg more or less ruled out coalition with Labour at the last Lib Dem conference, so they're back to square one. And the kind of concessions the SNP wants tend to be things that undermine Labour's strategic position.

Fourthly, the mechanics of forming a coalition might also work against Labour. After the election, Cameron remains Prime Minister. If Labour win an absolute majority, he will be out within hours. But if Labour fall short of a majority, then Cameron gets first go at forming a government. The SNP detest Labour and would demand tough concessions in time-consuming negotations. So Cameron would have time to attempt a coalition of his own, run a minority government ([see Canada 2006-11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/39th_Canadian_Parliament)) or do a supply-and-confidence deal with the SNP. That is more likely than other redditors appear to think: the SNP have ruled out a coalition with the Conservatives, but Salmond and Sturgeon [know from their own experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_3rd_Scottish_Parliament) that there are ways to get votes without a coalition.

I would like to see a proper back 4, with Stevie coming on after 60 minutes. He's played far too many matches in such a short amount of time. He should have had a rest midweek as it is. I'd also like to see Enrique in the side because he is better defensively than Moreno and has the strength / pace to keep up with Sanchez. I think a front three of Sterling / Markovic / Lallana would cause a lot of problems for the Arsenal defense.

Immigrants from areas such as Eastern Europe tend to get paid a lot less for a job that a British counterpart would be paid more, this can drive the wages in the industry down over time.

Overcrowding also wasn't mentioned in the article, with more people coming here it can also put strain on certain parts of our country, the population will rise as a result and things like public services among other things can begin to get strained, I know they use the tax they pay as an argument, however I don't believe the tax they pay alone can fund all the improvements needed to our systems to cover an increasing population, it goes deeper than just the public services as things like transport can also become a bit more clogged which can be a big harder to improve with money.

Its a bit of a logistical problem as a result, as you'll need to split the money between accounts and perform regular transfers between them in order to meet the requirements, and also set up specific direct debits etc.

3% on Santander up to £20k is probably the best, as after tax it pays 2.4% interest. Then, you can put the £10k into other accounts and deal with it all.

On the other hand, you can get 1.75% in a cash ISA. 

Therefore, if you can get the 2.4% on all your £30k in the current accounts (which takes a good amount of effort), you will be earning £195 a year more in interest than the ISA. Whether this is worth the effort is up to you. 

Even with the effort, you have to be very well organised to ensure that you always get maximum interest on all your current account deposits.

I don't mean to be an asshole or start an argument, and I'm not (just) trying to prove myself right and you wrong.

I'm genuinely replying to you so that I have the correct information. I don't want to repeat what I said in this thread, if it's wrong.

Having got that out the way, can you please provide me some evidence that:

&gt; ""Free at the point of use"" is not a nice sound bite. It is literally one of the core principles of the NHS.

Because I find ""free at the point of use"" used frequently without any reference to its origins.

The NHS constitution, for example, uses the words, but that appears, in fact, to have been [written in 2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS_Constitution_for_England), and it appears to postdict these ""founding principles"", subject to revision at 10 year intervals.

Meanwhile, we can easily find [Bevan's own words](http://www.sochealth.co.uk/resources/national-health-service/the-sma-and-the-foundation-of-the-national-health-service-dr-leslie-hilliard-1980/aneurin-bevan-and-the-foundation-of-the-nhs/in-place-of-fear-a-free-health-service-1952/):

* ""a free Health Service is bound to emerge triumphant.""

* ""opposition to the establishment of a free National Health Service.""

* ""Statesmen anxious to establish a free Health Service should keep that in mind.""

* ""the duty of making a free Health Service available to the community""

* ""The National Health Service and the Welfare State have come to be used as interchangeable terms, and in the mouths of some people as terms of reproach. Why this is so it is not difficult to understand, if you view everything from the angle of a strictly individualistic competitive society. A free health service is pure Socialism and as such it is opposed to the hedonism of capitalist society.""

Once I've seen evidence of the origins of this phrase ""free at the point of use"" the answers to the following questions will presumably become clear:

* Is my kid's primary school also ""free at the point of use""? What about the police and the fire brigade? Why do I only ever hear this term applied to the NHS?

* If, returning home from the hospital after an accident, isn't it still ""free at the point of use"" if I'm sent a bill by the NHS trust, and it's deducted weekly from my wages by the taxman. Is the only criteria for ""free at the point of use"" that the hospital asks for no cash up front before treating me?

Apologies for all the bulletpoints - at first I wanted to be clear that Bevan used the word ""free""  *repeatedly and unreservedly*, but then I wanted to separate out the questions in the second set, because their answers will surely be found when I know the origins of the phrase.

false,tineykitty,null,null,"I'm new to this subreddit, but I have seen a couple of posts re 'how to I avoid customs/handling' etc, and just wanted to post a short guide.

I won't discuss modes of delivery, nor other countries outside the UK, as this is outside of my experience of having packages delivered from outside the EU/UK.

Sources:

- [Tax and customs for goods sent from abroad](https://www.gov.uk/goods-sent-from-abroad/overview) from the gov.uk website

- [Parcelforce Worldwide clearance](http://www.parcelforce.com/parcelforce-worldwide-clearance)

- My own experience (therefore YMMV. You have been warned).

- I like the Socratic questioning way of doing things. Apologies.

**How can avoid paying customs duty on my haul?**

Short answer - you can't!

Longer answer, you first need to define a few things:

- how big is your haul, in price, weight and size

- what is likely to go on the outside of the package (i.e. 'marked as gift')

**Customs duty**

What is often referred to as 'customs' is in reality, not. HMRC are very clear as to what would incur a customs charge, which is **anything above £135**. More detail as to what that actually entails is on the gov.uk website above.

This would mean that the haul one would have to get to incur a customs cost would need to be enormous in reality. Imagine the number of sheet masks you would have to buy for that!

So, as generally we would be buying for personal use rather than wholesaling, *customs duty* would be largely irrelevant.

**VAT**

VAT, or value added tax, is the one that haulers may or may not get charged. This is not a guide to avoid paying VAT, as that would be fraud, and that doesn't need encouraging. However, there are circumstances where the hauler *wouldn't* be expected to pay VAT. This is on the gov.uk website above, but, for brevity, the following circumstances would have to be met:

- the haul is from outside the EU or EU special territories

- the item is marked as a gift, and is of the value of £36 or below. Or

- the item is *not* marked as a gift, and is of the value of £15 or below. 

It also would need to *look like it meets those requirements*. A huge, heavy box, marked as £36 and 'gift', which is 5kg, will probably raise many eyebrows down at Inland Revenue.

If you are charged VAT, then it would have been deemed by the delivery company that your haul has either failed to meet those requirements, or you have booze, cigarettes or perfume in the haul.

VAT, at the time of writing is 20% of the items you have bought, plus the postage and packaging, and (if you have hauled &gt;£136) and duty you may owe. For the purposes of personal use, it's unlikely to include customs duty, for the reasons stated earlier.

To summarise, *unless your haul looks like it meets those three requirements above, you will be charged VAT*.

Remember, paying taxes is a civic duty, and goes to pay for valuable services (yes, this is a point of debate, but roads need tarmacing, hospitals need equipment, and I realise there is stuff I didn't agree morally to pay for. *This is not the place to discuss the philosophy of taxation*)!

**Handling fee**

This is where things start to get mysterious. Particular carriers will charge a [handling fee](http://www.parcelforce.com/parcelforce-worldwide-clearance) if you either need to pay VAT or duty on any package. They can make a separate charge if they have to hold your haul whilst customs clear your package.

Although I stated I wouldn't discuss delivery, this is where your decision over how to get stuff to the UK efficiently may effect your choice of delivery. For example, using Parcelforce as the delivery company (you may have no choice over this): 

- Parcels delivered via EMS will automatically incur a charge of £13.50

- Parcels valued &gt; EUR 1000 will incur the above charge

- Parcels not picked up promptly or have customs enquiries dealt with will incur a [rolling charge after 10 days](http://www.parcelforce.com/parcelforce-worldwide-clearance)

Although I have cited Parcelforce, other delivery companies may or may not do something similar.

**But you didn't answer my question! I don't want to pay...**

You may not want to pay duties/tax, but in reality we do. We cannot, and should not avoid it, as it is a civic duty to do so. This is not a guide on how to avoid paying these fees, it is here as a guide to the rules.

And remember, *in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.*

**OK, so what now?**

Try this:

- there are sites which will be kind enough to mark your haul with VAT-efficient pricings; check the sidebar for further information.

- consider splitting your order into VAT-efficient chunks

- avoid EMS shipping if you can. One time, standard shipping [was as quick as EMS](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2pm6qv/uk_im_planning_a_mid_size_rrs_haul_im_worried/cmy0jjy)

- if you get charged VAT, then pay the handling fee quickly

false,q_pop,null,null,"/u/satiristowl makes an interesting point about taking advice. You could do worse than heading to unbiased.co.uk and finding a local chartered financial planner or two to talk to.

I will look at some obvious concerns with your asset allocation, but that doesn't replace proper financial advice:

* Your equity allocations are odd. The world is weighted ~ 50% US, 15% Europe, 8% Japan, 7% UK. By deviating a large amount from that weighting you are taking an active investment decision. There is an argument for reducing currency risk by investing more in the UK proportionally, but having equal weighting to the largest market in the world (US) and the more volatile emerging markets makes for an odd choice.

* Investing in a property ETF to hedge against prices sounds sensible on the face of it, and if your timescale was 5 years I would not be as dismissive, but over 6 months you're opening yourself to serious equity risk. Take a look at the [Blackrock Global Property Securities Tracker](http://www.trustnet.com/Factsheets/Factsheet.aspx?fundCode=M2FD5&amp;univ=U&amp;pagetype=performance). It invests in REITs globally but is a fair proxy. Peak-to-trough in two months in 2013 the fund lost ~25% of its value. Stick to cash for any planned expenditure closer than 3 years.

&gt; It's a pretty big cash allocation but I can't afford to get wiped out in another 2008-style meltdown.

* You are paying significant opportunity-cost for that caution. There is a concept of being ""recklessly cautious"". I assume your major need is for income, and the capital value is a side-effect. Once you've spent 25% on a property, you'll be left with ~ £900,000. In a typical 60/40 equity/bond portfolio you could reasonably expect to draw 4% year-in year-out and for the large majority of this drawing to be ""natural income"" from the portfolio. This would amount to £36,000 PA income without the capital diminishing. By weighting 25% to cash this income expectation drops to ~ £27,000-£30,000.

My feeling is that you're approaching this backwards. You need to work out what you want/need (income needs, planned capital expenditure), allocate to cash in expectation of capital expenditure, understand your attitude to risk (look into finametrica or similar), consider what sort of investment growth you need for the income required, and assess how realistic that plan is.

I feel like a broken record saying this, but if nothing else, pick up ""Smarter Investing"" by Tim Hale and read it cover-to-cover. It will give you a great grounding in terms of expected returns from assets and so on, and if you do decide to speak to a financial adviser you'll be speaking from a position of knowledge, which helps.

](https://www.gov.uk/individual-savings-accounts/if-you-move-abroad-or-die)
&gt;If you move abroad

&gt;If you open an Individual Savings Account (ISA) in the UK and then move abroad, you can’t put money into it after you move (unless you’re a Crown employee working overseas or their spouse or civil partner).

&gt;However, you can keep your ISA open and you’ll still get UK tax relief on money and investments held in it.

&gt;You can pay into your ISA again if you return and become a UK resident (subject to the annual ISA allowance).

It's very hard to plan for the long-term when you don't know where you'll settle. There are some provisions with UK pensions that allow contributions (and some tax relief) for a couple of years after tax residency.

It may be worth looking into the QROPS regime. Typical domiciles are Isle of Mann or Jersey. The downsides are complexity and cost.

Whilst not ideal, you might be as well setting up an ""unwrapped"" investment plan in the UK to act as a long-term vehicle, as there are no restrictions for non-UK residents. When investing in equities ISAs/pensions aren't that advantageous from a dividend point of view, but you would need to be judicious with capital gains tax management in the long-term (pretty easy to do if you're investing in funds)",0,1418980447,null,0,false,0,cmzg5jk,t3_2pqmjo,t1_cmzg5jk,t3_2pqmjo,null,1425320160,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3

As for Britain First and BNP, the point I made in my previous post is that UKIP tends to attract those from that side of the political spectrum despite their differences. 

I thought [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO22-FW5Qdc) speech by Farage in the EU helps to highlight the differences, for balance, [here's something that BNP posted on their site](http://www.bnp.org.uk/news/national/bnp-ukip-how-we-are-different) (Not that I agree with what BNP are saying or stand for by any means)

I'd like to assume that Farage hasn't said those statements but there's of course no way to prove it either way, the policies UKIP stand for are what I agree with and unless they openly say a statement such as that, I'll continue to support them.

My typical route has me going along Regent Road and Deansgate.

On the way home, it gets where traffic on my direction is at a standstill, while the other direction is flowing.  
I filter [well, in this case, it's definitely overtaking] as long as the oncoming isn't going too quick - say 10-15mph. But, I need to be very careful, as traffic on my side often decide at the last minute to turn right into a side street.  
It's far more dangerous than 'regular' filtering, and you need to keep an eye out for gaps you can squeeze back into when you need to.

Regent Road's filtering is a piece of piss, though [pretty much a 40mph limit dual carriageway]. Only need to watch for the occasional lane change - look for large gaps ahead on one side, or the obvious indicators - but typically, it'll be a clear run to the A57(M)

Which roads are you talking about? Knowing how it looks can give an idea of how safe filtering can be there.

But the caveat is *always*: if you have any uncertainty about the gap, don't risk it.  
Better to be an hour late home than not at all.

false,chub79,eu,Brittany,"&gt; A library is no longer the primary means of circulating information and it is time we stopped pretending it is.

There's been a study in France (I could find the link if you can read French) regarding University libraries describing some of the problems the general public libraries also face (plus a couple of more specifics). Indeed, it explained how the public behavior had changed but it described various ideas for libraries to adapt their offer without having to lose their soul. Basically, like most brick and mortars industries, libraries have not been able to cope with the high speed at which things have changed in the last 15 years or so.

Libraries shouldn't compete with the web but focus on their social impact in the local community (they should also federate in a much greater network of libraries as well as embrace the [FRBR norm](http://frbr.slis.kent.edu/)). The way it's been done in my home town is that we have a massive central library. Its building is shared with two museums, a kids playground, a planetarium... so it's a point of convergence for people (not to mention it's open on the Sunday when shops aren't, people love to come there). But we also have smaller sattelite libraries that benefit from the big one (they reuse its infrastructure and allow people to drop documents there instead of at the central library for instance).


However, many librarians I've talked to are not comfortable with the Internet and how to respond to the way their user's behaviors have changed. They are trying but they need to lose the ""we are the only holders of knowledge"" type of mentality.

Think review is just lifting the ban because it's out dated to modern combat and the review is just to check what level soldiers can work like if it's true about weight carrying limits etc in infantry units or what duties are best suited for their combat strengths.

When it comes to mental side of things lot of women war zone journalists have been in scary combat situations and dealt with rape and torture and continued their work. In WW2 some of the best resistance fighters and spys we sent out were women 

In mental and physical strengths it does go down to the individual but I think men are tested for this it's makes sense to allow women who are capable to be able to have this option open to them. The type of person to volunteer for this tough work environment is likely going to be someone who will train themselves to be fit and be mentally prepared. So it'll be weird if an unfit woman volunteers for it.

false,[deleted],null,null,"Getting a degree needs to mean something for it to help people and it doesn't anymore.  Quite the opposite in fact:  Now, by giving more people degrees, we are just penalizing those without.  Before, with good A-Levels you could join somewhere and work your way up a bit but now employers insist you have a degree to even start.  You will never use what you learnt, but you have to have the (very expensive and time consuming to get) piece of paper.

There is a happy medium between keeping degrees accessible and maintaining their value and you are right to say we can't just slash the number of places on a ""quality crusade"" but right now, we are massively to the other end of the extreme:  Literally millions of people are forced to waste years of their lives to get a piece of paper just so they can do a middle level office job.

I also think you need to re-consider the unqualified/unskilled part of your comment:  Workers with degrees are very qualified, but are they any more skilled than they were before they started uni (aside from in essay writing a skill not demanded by the majority of employers)?  Are they any more skilled than they would be if they'd spent the same 3 years working?  I strongly doubt this.

I did a very strong degree subject (Physics) but now I work in an office with computers in a software/finance role.  It would have been better to give me 12 months Networking and Intro to Finance than to teach me the deep mysteries of the universe (and charge me ~£40k for the privilege).  I never solve complex differential equations, I don't deal with radioactive samples, I don't write up lab results.

My brother has a degree in English Lit and Mythology, he sorts out people's council tax issues.  He does not read them beowolf or Kant, though in fairness his work is sometimes Kafkaesque :).

Neither of us would have been considered for our roles without our irrelevant degrees.  But the degrees were totally useless to our roles.  Continuing like this is madness.  It's worse for truly academic people who now have to pay and sit with a bunch of others, for three years, just there for the ride.  It's worse for the non-academic people who just want to be able to earn more than minimum wage as they have to learn things of no use or interest to them and they also have to pay and waste three years of their lives doing it.

We should increase the rigour and we should offer alternatives and require employers to accept and support them.  People under 25 should be able to apply for jobs with 3 good A-Levels on the same footing as those with degrees except for a few very specific vocations (medical mostly) and get paid and accrue university credit through work experience and evening classes.",0,1418983769,null,0,false,0,cmzgsyw,t3_2pro3z,t1_cmzgsyw,t1_cmzgj8i,null,1425319857,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

false,TheDukeofReddit,null,null,"A lot of that stuff is overblown though. It depends on circumstance and technology. There are numerous first hand accounts that you can find if you search for of why soldiers do not. They don't want to kill because they often realize that person they are killing is no different than them, so they refrain from doing so unless that person is actively trying to kill them. E.g. Soldiers see some guy taking a morning piss they are a lot less likely to shoot him at that moment. 

The other aspect is technology. The goal of battle is not to kill, but to complete an objective. Take this land, force these people back, etc. The threat of violence and the ritual of war is often enough to do that. Many technologies throughout history have allowed individual soldiers to project power that force an opponent to react without actually exercising it. Think of soldiers being pinned down by a machine gun nest. The fact that the MG is there might dictate that they might look to move around, they might wait for armored or aerial support, they might retreat, or they might use tactics to take it out. But there is a shared understanding of the situation by soldiers of when it is lost and when it is not.  When they will try their best to kill each other and when they will not. The MG nest can guess what will happen. The people in it can fire for a bit simply to prevent the enemy from throwing away their lives or taking their perception without trying their best to kill someone. After they hold it for an amount of time, if is then acceptable to retreat (or reinforcement arrives). 

Militarily, the second option is often preferable because the result is often functionally the same. It is said to be a strength of the US army that individual soldiers are capable of making decisions themselves. You give them information, they often know when they HAVE to hold or take a position. But if you give them an objective they often do their best to satisfy it and it adds a desirable flexibility to things. Bend don't break, smarter not harder. 

morale and discipline are such important concepts throughout history as a result of this ""kill and be killed"" idea. The idea is that you are not the first ones to break. The ones who break first are then run down by cavalry and slaughtered much more impersonally.  Morale keeps you from breaking and discipline allows you to move as a collective unit to respond to the situation--because if half the line broke you were fucked and it was time to run. If you were well trained in how to deal with those situations as a collective and have faith in the men next you, you will stay and fight, avoiding that disaster, and fight much more effectively. But that *belief* in the men next to you, instilled by discipline, is likely more important than the actual training. 

I have kind of rambled, but it isn't that people aren't psychologically capable of killing, but it's that killing historically hasn't been the point.  There is an emergent understanding between combatants of how an engagement is going to go and when it is necessary to kill or not. How this manifests changes with technology, the culture, and the purpose of the war. But there is this understanding.

If you are interested in reading about this, there is a book called ""just and unjust war"" by Walzer that explore this. It's a bit dry, but it explores this much better than I. ",0,1418984121,null,0,false,0,cmzgv8q,t3_2prft9,t1_cmzgv8q,t1_cmzgacj,null,1425319828,20,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,20

There's barely been great service to him, he's never really ran INTO open space from a through ball for him to finish or choose a side. He's never had a ball from the wing delivered to him in a goalscoring position (and it's not that he doesn't get into them).

He doesn't fit our style.

Had he been in the squad when Bale and Defoe were on opposite wings and they were constantly hitting teams on the attack - Soldado would have been fantastic. If he goes to a club that can provide him the right service, he can still come good as a 15+ goals a season striker at the least. He's almost 30, he's been playing football a certain way for 12 years for a living, he's seen success in playing that way and now he's asking to just CHANGE IT UP SONNNY. It's a hard thing to do, and at this stage, we'd be better off giving him till the end of the season and selling him while we can still get 60-70% of our return back, and invest in a younger player who can be moulded with the raw talent he has, or we go for a proven PL striker like Benteke / Bony.",0,1418984159,null,0,false,0,cmzgvh6,t3_2prtyk,t1_cmzgvh6,t1_cmzg9kt,null,1425319829,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

Is it more likely that 50% of people are suddenly smarter, more creative, dynamic, responsible hard working etc than they were before?  Or that we just gave everyone some paperwork?

Of course, it's at least a little of both.  But we've reached (and I think passed) the point where the margin benefit is outweighed by the marginal cost (this is really just a over complex way of re-asserting my point, sorry).

The reasons we have kept going past the logical stop point are, IMHO:












 * Politicians who control how many people go don't pay the cost, they are rewarded for keeping people occupied (and off the unemployment list) and for increasing their remits and bureaucracy
 * Much of the cost is borne by people who either had degrees already or were going to get one either way, by devaluing their degree.  But, like inflation, this cost is hidden and not paid in cash.
 * People (politicians, voters, employers, students, etc) mistake qualifications with skills or employability.
 * There is rightly a push for kids to do the best they can and go as far as they can.  But no one stops to say ""is this actually worth the effort and expense?"".  It's often not.
 * We offer few alternatives to a degree.  Even if you think you can do a ""graduate"" job without a degree, no one will hire you.  There are few non-graduate jobs that provide the same level of income and security and those that do require significant upfront investment that the government refuses to help with (try being a tradesman without a van and insurance or tools!).  So even those who do raise their heads and think ""do I really want to spend £40k studying greek-myth or particle physics?"" have no option but to do it anyway.

We need some alternative to university to get workers secure, well paying jobs.  We need some alternative to university to get them skilled and employable.  Sending everyone to uni is like trying to put all a ships passengers into one lifeboat:  The boat sinks and takes down both the people who were meant to be in it and those who were sent the wrong way.

* EU directives stipulate that this ID card should be sufficient for said non-EU family member to travel all around the EU, entering other member states at will. Most member states have abided by this, the UK has refused to do for many years.  The UK has instead required that non-EU family members of EU citizens applied for a special visa they made up called an 'EEA Family Permit', in advance of arrival.

   So you are arguing we should build social housing for the new arrivals? Well, the housing problem is (crudely) proportional to 

   number of houses   minus  number of people 

You can increase the number of houses, or reduce the rate of increase of the number of people. Personally, I feel we should do both :) 

A glance at the London skyline shows there is a crazy building boom: but this will have no effect on rents if the ""success"" of immigration means more people keep coming.
    We are told that that we should welcome this because of (small) economic advantages, but I have not seen any academic studies that try to take into account even the effects of increased rent on quality of life of native Londoners. 

Back in the stone age, when I left university, an ordinary person with an ordinary job could get a mortgage and buy a house. The lifestyle shown in the BBC's ""Outnumbered"" was possible on a teacher's salary. Try to imagine that.

House prices have risen since, for many reason.  One obvious reason that underpins the current boom is the rapid increase in population. This means my London flat is now insanely valuable -- but this is not of direct benefit to me. I'd rather my children could buy their own. 

The rate of immigration -- as a percentage of the population -- is now much higher than at any other time in UK history.  It is an exceptional and extraordinary policy, with irreversible social effects.  The natural policy -- and the popular view -- is to restrict it. You need some very good arguments to say that the current policy of unlimited EU migration is a good idea...

false,hungoverseal,null,null," it's dumb as fuck in combat force sub 150k. In an army that small every combat troop has to be border line elite. The vast majority of women are not as physically capable as men and added to that far fewer women are interested in the military so statistically speaking those few women are going to be far inferior to the elite picked from a selection of men. A good example would be from Sport, the Williams sisters challenged the the 200th ranked male tennis player. He thrashed both of them one after the other, preparing for the games with a round of golf and a few shandy's in the morning.

But that's not really the main reason why, because there definitely are women out there who can meet the minimum requirements. Infantry live together, eat together, train together, sleep together (no homo lol) and die together. It's about trust and comradeship. That breaks down when pussy is involved. And I'm not saying this is a problem with women, it's a problem with men. Do you trust the guy next you to cover your back or is has he got one eye on the girl he's secretly banging? Did this girl fuck her way to the top, why should I listen to her? (doesn't matter whether it's true or not, guys will think it.) Nothing breaks down relationships between men like girls. Just look at town on a friday night. And on top of that you get the whole white knighting phenomenon stopping people doing their jobs properly.

Then add to that the logistical problems and the other issues you get when you mix vulnerable women in isolated areas with drunk, horny men living in a world where the rules of society are flipped on their head. It's probably best not to even think about what would happen to POW's.

That all said there are lots of fucking awesome women in the military and conflicts like Afghan and Iraq have shown how important mixed gender military is. But they don't need to be in the frontline. Yes when you look at history women have made brilliant soldiers (e.g Red Army, Viet Cong) but that is in the context of total war. Not in a minuscule professional fighting force.

So yeah you can call this sexist. But sexism goes out the window as far I'm concerned when you get to industrial scale legalised murder.

The real reason for all this though is probably something to do with the government dropping 30,000 highly skilled and experienced troops and then being surprised when they can't convince 30,000 civilians to take up the slack on their day off

Ironically, it was the Good Friday Agreement which did for SDLP, who have largely been surpassed on the left by the rehabilitated Sinn Féin. 

With the SDLP seen by some as a spent force, it raises the question as to why the two Labour Parties continue to stay out of NI.

As for banks not being taxed: Tax reciepts from the banking sector have been at least £20 billion/year every year since at least 2005, with the exception of '08-'09 and '09-'10, where they dropped to nearer £15 billion/year.

As for regulating the banks better, isn't that really the fault of pre-crisis politicians and the banking regulator, for not regulating them well enough back then? The lending that caused the crisis was reckless but not illegal, after all.

It's also important to note that reckless lending is only obviously reckless in hindsight. We've all made a bad bet that seems obvious in hindsight but wasn't at the time, after all. The ""Gamblers Fallacy"" is a known failure of the human condition, that we don't make good decisions where risk is involved.

Even the post-crisis politicians in power now can't really be held accountable for the mistakes of their predecessors. Regulations have been tightened considerably since the crisis, and it is important to note that we cannot just apply regulations unilaterally, given the importance of the banking sector to our economy.

They actually turned down the Christmas dinner laid on by the European Parliament which was definitely a lot more epic and subsidised by the taxpayer.  The dinner they turned down was a sit down meal at the European Parliament's The Jan restaurant that included coconut cream soup with smoked duck breast, pheasant with fois gras and truffle (which is admittedly naughty but very nice, having tried it but definitely not something done on a budget) or lobster au gratin with lemon sabayon.   

UKIP MEPs did not attend on the principle of it costing the taxpayer (could have really lead with that - oh wait, I did - *""they've already turned down the free Christmas dinner""*.  Very first sentence)...

[...which is why they arranged a cheaper alternative Christmas venue for their own group which included hot pot and some play pancake blinis.](https://twitter.com/JaniceUKIP/status/540449350842081280)

The article is about a discount buffet the EFDD laid on because it didn't want to eat whole lobster and stuffed pheasant breast as it didn't feel it could justify it to the taxpayer!  *BURN.*

false,Dardanator,null,null,"I think that there is more to consider than just who gets into power when assessing whether Scotland (or any other part of the country) makes me difference. In the 2010 election Scotland did mal a difference, if you remove Scottish seats from parliament you end up with a conservative majority rather than a con-ld coalition. That is a pretty significant difference, as the lib dems have prevented the conservatives from enacting certain policies or limited their extent. From what little I remember of the tuition fee rise, it would have been worse under a tory majority.

Even in situations where a government doesn't change according to Scottish seats, there is still the matter of how many seats. A smaller majority makes it easier for the government to lose votes due to rebellious mps or to lose their majority from by election losses and mps crossing the floor. And the government faces greater scrutiny from the opposition (always the largest non governing party) if they have more mps to oppose the government as one block. Even if Scotland doesn't change the number of seats the government has, it can  still change the make up of the opposition. It even counts right down to individual MPs; we had over a decade of having Scottish MPs as chancellor and several years with one as PM, as well as other important cabinet positions being Scots. If Scotland wasn't as pro labour then, those MPs may not have been elected or appointed to the cabinet, so their jobs would have been done by someone else and the country could have been a very different place.

You are right that to win the election a party mainly needs to win over England, by virtue of England accounting for the vast majority of seats, but this is far harder than you make it out to be. England is a large and heavily populated place with many distinctly different regions. There is not very much a party could do to win over all of England, something that wins over one part could very well alienate another part. Something that wins over Scotland could easily win over many in England too.

Really, to win the UK, a party mainly needs to win over the marginal seats, and whether a seat is marginal is entirely the decision of the people who live there. I live in an area full of very safe labour seats where most people wouldn't dream of ever voting tory, and wouldn't dare vote for any other party for fear of letting the tories in. Yet this region is full of poverty and unemployment despite labour governments in Westminster and Cardiff. Labour don't need to pay much attention to us because they know they'll win here,  and the other parties don't pay much attention because they know they will never win. Ironically I think if people were more willing to vote for other parties, especially the conservatives, then things would be better, as labour would have to work to earn votes. Likewise even a conservative government might invest money into the region as it could help them win the next election. But the problem we have with political representation is entirely our own fault, it was the choice of people here and nobody else to only vote for one party. Voting reform could certainly help but having an inherent hatred of one party (in this case the tories) doesn't help at all. Just as being blindly loyal to one business because you hate their competitor is silly, far better to put yourself on the fence between the two so that they will compete for your business and offer you better deals.

Like where I live,  a large chunk of the Scottish population have engineered a situation for the country where they only elect labour MPs because they have an intense dislike of the tories as a brand. Things might be better for them if they were more open to voting for the tories by letting their choice of Scottish tory mps shape and influence the party and getting both parties to compete for votes. Now labour are collapsing and people are rushing to the SNP, which could eventually kick labour into action and start putting more effort into winning votes in Scotland. But if people hold an attitude of ""I hate labour and I will never vote for them again"" just as they have with the tories then I don't see how  continuing to be a one party nation will benefit Scotland in the long run (though there is still some scope for other parties to emerge as competition to keep them on their toes).",0,1418990753,null,0,false,0,cmzi48t,t3_2pojl3,t1_cmzi48t,t1_cmykqnr,null,1425319224,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Nevertheless, even though I didn't have any prior understanding that it was an insult, once that meaning is told to me, I now understand that if anyone says ""chink"" to me, they are trying to insult me.

The *reason* it is considered offensive is historical. The word itself was [created](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chink) during a time of high anti-Chinese racism and exploitation of Chinese immigrant workers in the west, and also heavily used during wars between Western and Eastern nations. Hence, it was used to refer to Chinese labourers as well as enemies.

I'm afraid that saying ""it wasn't meant as an insult"" just doesn't make sense. You simply have no reason to use the word ""chink"" instead of ""Chinese"" or ""Asian"" or whatever *unless* you mean to offend.

Firstly, I think his argument is along the lines of the entire political class are all aligned on most issues. The difference between labour, lib dem and tory policy is slim-to-none. Nobody opposes the neo-liberal consensus, even though it has been identified as a cause of increased inequality, lower social cohesion and worse health in society.

The reason is because the Neo-Liberal consensus benefits 'capitalists' (in the sense of people who own capital), and this category is one of the main funders of all political parties. It's not a new problem, but Turkeys don't vote for Christmas anymore than policy-makers will choose policies that will lose them funding.

So Brand argues that there needs to be a party worth voting for, that actually opposes harmful Neo-Liberalism (not all Neo-Liberalism is harmful). No politician will tackle this question however, because it will cost their party funding, which means they can't campaign as effectively, which means they'll lose elections. This is the thinking behind Blair's New Labour - first you must become elected by whatever means, and only then can you start to enact policy you like.

Secondly, Brand is a comedian and a polemicist. He's giving voice to the voiceless - his sentiments are not unique, he is simply in a privileged position to be heard. That he doesn't have the right answers isn't his responsibility - we employ politicians who should be the best of us who can listen to what Brand is saying and give good answers.

&gt; f you make a Gift Aid declaration when you donate to a registered charity, the charity will receive additional income from the government.

&gt; For example, if you pay £100 to a charity, the Gift Aid declaration will trigger a £25 contribution from the government.

&gt;Higher-rate taxpayers should make sure to claim the payment on their tax returns, as higher-rate relief is also available. Taxpayers paying tax at the 40% rate can reduce their tax bill by a further quarter of the gift, so they can reduce their tax bill by £25, making the net cost of the gift £75.

Yeah this happened in the 80s and 90s when private company pensions were common, but thats not how any pension you can get in todays market works any more. 

The money losing pensions were tied to specific companies who ran their own pension funds and dipped into them to pay their bills when business dried up. They are almost extinct as a pension now, i've never even seen one any more. 


Every kind of pension you can get today is not one of those - they are run by seperate companies, and are traded across various markets according to your preferences. You can ask for max risk, biggest gain potential, or minium risk , lowest gain (ie, keep it in cash etc) and they'll do it for you.


If you can get salary sacrifice for pension from your employer, it's a really good deal.
for example, I pay £90/month on salary sacrifice , my employer matches that and I get the 20% boost (i'm not a higher rate tax payer), so £221 a month goes into my pension, but it only costs me £90. If i was higher rate, that would be £250/month. that's £160 a month of free money, nevermind any gains it makes over the years (at ~ 5% it will double  in 15 years time) ",0,1418992042,null,0,false,0,cmzieao,t3_2ps549,t1_cmzieao,t1_cmzi8ko,null,1425319094,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

There are so many areas where a blanket ban not only doesn't work but is actually counterproductive that to assert that language is somehow different is ignoring the parallels - absolutes never work unless a word only has one meaning - hence 'nigger' is definitely off the table, but I take offence at someone asserting that a word that actually makes up part of their country that *does* get used innocently can't be because a minority are idiots, in exactly the same way that I'd take offence at being called an alcoholic just because other people misuse the stuff. I'm still a realist, though - I wouldn't make such statements on reddit (Certainly in /r/UK) without expecting a certain amount of Herp Derp in response, but that then makes it more important to do so - we had the Oz trial decades ago to establish that simply taking a word or phrase to be insulting via ignoring the context of use is not a legal basis to be offended.

Beyond the bailouts there has been quantitative easing and a BoE based lending of last resort to encourage banks to lend money. As a consequence, they've built up another unsustainable asset bubble. Brands point that to give these banks, that have received *everything they have wanted for the last 30 years and then fucked our economy up anyway*, a bailout before cutting public services is beyond insulting.

&gt; As for banks not being taxed:

I didn't say they weren't taxed, I said they begged not to be taxed. Not a single post-crisis tax has been levied on those that caused the shit storm. Instead, public services have to be cut to restructure an economy *yet more in their favour*.

&gt; As for regulating the banks better, isn't that really the fault of pre-crisis politicians and the banking regulator, for not regulating them well enough back then? The lending that caused the crisis was reckless but not illegal, after all.

When you purchase the influence of politicians the law is thrown out the window, you can't then blame the politicians because you made it this way. Plenty of things that are completely immoral and unethical are legal. When a dictator owns a government we don't say ""oh, well its technically legal for him to shit on his population"". 

&gt; It's also important to note that reckless lending is only obviously reckless in hindsight.

Not when you instigate regulatory capture in order to allow a highly unstable derivatives market a decade before.

&gt; Even the post-crisis politicians in power now can't really be held accountable for the mistakes of their predecessors. 

I hold them accountable for their actions. Actions like the joke of ""self regulation"" in the form of project Merlin - the magic act to make the blame go away. Regulations have not been significantly tightened.

&gt; So really, the whole thing is just Russel Brand sprouting populist nonsense.

People are right to be angry at the financial sector that, since 1980, and the following ""big bang"" has had everything they have ever wanted. Regulations torn up and taxes reduced before creating western states that can be divided up into assets trade-able as securities.

The problem with the electricity market in the UK is that it was designed when big centralised, reliable generation was normal. This is changing, with massive amounts of unreliable power coming to market, and more importantly, the unreliable power is ""privileged"" in the market in that it is not allowed to be rejected at times of low electricity demand. In the event of unexpectedly high wind production, other power stations must shut down and sacrifice their income.

This is causing problems for power station operators as they are selling less and less energy, and the current method of selling power doesn't take into account reliability. 

A power station has large fixed costs, capital, staffing, maintenance which have to be paid, even if they don't generate. However, in the current market, they get nothing unless their power is taken. This is causing some power station operators to decommission their plants. The risk with this is that in the event of a wind failure, then there will be no backup power available to keep the lights on.

To get around this, the government has added a new facility to the electricity market. Essentially, the power stations could bid in a reverse auction to keep their plants on standby, ready to produce if required.

Assaidi, Aspas, Alberto, Ilori are, for me complete misses.

I think it's ridiculous to include players on loan like Sahin, Moses because it's not like it cost you guys a lot to bring in players for cover like these guys - so from that angle I don't think you can expect much from them.

Sakho, Mignolet, Allen I disagree with completely: 

I think Mignolet hasn't been the #1 you wanted but until recently you never really heard much about him in the press because he seemed to be doing a decent job. So Savage has basically concluded he's a miss based on the last month it seems. 

Allen has always seemed to be a willing runner for you guys and a decent squad player and Sakho has a mistake in him but is still incredibly young for a CB to be measured. He will be immense when he gets a good partner alongside him.

The signings from this summer - you cannot make any real judgements yet. They've been playing over here for a few months now and already you're seeing glimpses of the player Markovic will be, same with Can and Moreno.

Borini isn't the best out there but you need squad players.

I don't think Robbie Savage realises that players like Borini, Allen etc are great to have around as backups - you cannot have 25 superstars. Like Utd have had Fletcher, O'Shea etc over the years as decent enough backups.

In conclusion:

I hate you guys but you're only a few squad members away (forward, #1 GK, CB maybe (Lovren...) from having a good team now and in the future.

No, I'm suggesting we build social housing for everyone who needs it.

&gt;One obvious reason that underpins the current boom is the rapid increase in population.

This isn't the case, the current boom has happened in the last 2 years, are you suggesting that before then migration wasn't affecting house prices and only now people are moving to London and increasing house prices? 

surely the fact interest rates are next to nothing has a much larger effect on the housing market, coupled with the shakiness of the stock market and the relative political stability of the UK means London property was a pretty good place to dump money.

&gt;with irreversible social effects

That's not unique to immigration policy, nor is it a bad thing (I certainly don't think so but I'd like to hear your input)

 &gt;You need some very good arguments to say that the current policy of unlimited EU migration is a good idea

I'm not saying it's the best thing to sliced bread, but you can see from the stats it's positive for the economy, it's a good thing politically (due to the EU's clout) and a good thing for cultural enrichment.

It's not like this has suddenly become an issue, the rate of immigration  growth has been fairly predictable, it's the cuts on public services and lack of spending that have the larger effect on people and migration is just being used as a scapegoat when it is not a problem, nor is it the problem for Britain.",0,1418996972,null,0,false,0,cmzjq27,t3_2pke7c,t1_cmzjq27,t1_cmzh99p,null,1425318475,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

false,somethingdifferent34,null,null,"&gt;The financial crash is directly responsible for austerity measures. The bailout is one aspect of the financial crash. Beyond the bailouts there has been quantitative easing and a BoE based lending of last resort to encourage banks to lend money. As a consequence, they've built up another unsustainable asset bubble. Brands point that to give these banks, that have received everything they have wanted for the last 30 years and then fucked our economy up anyway, a bailout before cutting public services is beyond insulting.

I don't disagree, but the bailout itself is nothing to do with the governments cuts. So when Brand compares the two in the manner he has done, he is absolutely being disingenuous. It leads the layman to think ""They lowered my benefits to gave £46 billion to RBS, the bastards"", which is just not the case at all.

QE is just a method of lowering real interest rates, used on top of lowering the base rate as low as possible. It has helped the whole economy, not just the banking sector. So again, irrelevant.

The BoE's lending of last resort has been and gone, and had little negative effect on anything. So no idea what you're complaining about here.

""to give these banks, that have received everything they have wanted for the last 30 years and then fucked our economy up anyway, a bailout before cutting public services is beyond insulting."" 

This could just as easily be phrased as 

""Since being unshacked from *unfair, overbearing regulation* 30 years ago, banks have *for the first time* needed a little help from the taxpayer on a *strictly temporarily basis*, after providing many hundreds of billions in tax revenues for the last 30 years. The help provided to the banks *will* lead to profits for the taxpayer in the long run""

Both would be hyperbole.

&gt;I didn't say they weren't taxed, I said they begged not to be taxed. Not a single post-crisis tax has been levied on those that caused the shit storm. Instead, public services have to be cut to restructure an economy yet more in their favour.

How is cutting benefits helping the banks at all?

&gt;When you purchase the influence of politicians the law is thrown out the window, you can't then blame the politicians because you made it this way. Plenty of things that are completely immoral and unethical are legal. When a dictator owns a government we don't say ""oh, well its technically legal for him to shit on his population"".

I don't really understand what you are saying. Nobody owns the British government. Banks lobby the government for a favorable tax/regulatory environment, just as pretty much all other major industries do in this country. There's nothing inherently wrong with this.

&gt;Not when you instigate regulatory capture in order to allow a highly unstable derivatives market a decade before.

Considerably more than a decade before, actually. In fact the deregulation of banking was mainly done by the Thatcher government in the mid 80's, and it is important to note these changes lead to over 30 years of growth in the banking industry and many hundreds of billions in tax receipts before it all got out of hand. Are you actually suggesting that Britain would be better off today if the derivatives market had never been deregulated? Talk about throwing the baby with the bathwater!

&gt;I hold them accountable for their actions. Actions like the joke of ""self regulation"" in the form of project Merlin - the magic act to make the blame go away. Regulations have not been significantly tightened.

Is Basel III a joke, then? EMIR? The BoE stress tests? There has been a significant tightening of regulation since the crash. Banks need to hold MUCH more Tier 1 capital than before. And as I already said (at point to which you have provided no real counterpoint, I might add) ""it is important to note that we cannot just apply regulations unilaterally, given the importance of the banking sector to our economy."".

&gt;People are right to be angry at the financial sector that, since 1980, and the following ""big bang"" has had everything they have ever wanted. Regulations torn up and taxes reduced before creating western states that can be divided up into assets trade-able as securities. Maybe Brand doesn't speak money, but don't be fooled by the men that do - this is their world and they get what they want and their interests will always be opposed to ours.

It is a regulated healthcare profession, and those claiming to be a chiropractor must have the relevant qualifications, have indemnity and medical negligence insurance, be registered with the British Chiropractic Council.

I havent seen *anyone* do anything about it, including UKIP; i think all the political parties in this country are bullshit. But i think UKIP is worse than the others for scapegoating people. It is easy to point to a group of people and blame them, its been done since the 16th century when Queen Elizabeth 1 blamed black people for the food shortage.

&gt; That doesn't alter the fact that bringing so many people in, in such a short time frame, is damaging to our country. Our infrastructure can't cope. 

Says who? The only reason our infrastructure has gotten worse (if it even has for that matter) *since 2008* is because of the financial crises. A crises caused by rich people in powerful positions that are unaccountable to the electorate. But instead of addressing the actual problem (unaccountability) you want to address the *symptoms* of the problem.

These werent causes for concern before 2008, but they are now. I wonder why... ever since a derivatives trader (a.k.a. banker) has taken the limelight no one seems to be doing anything about banker accountability.

Farage is as out of touch as milliband and Cameron. Farage is only different because he gives you a scape goat e.g. migrants or the EU. Neither of which are the real problems (the EU needs reform i agree, but leaving it is fucking retarded).

My girlfriend's job is in central London, our friends are here and we love the city.  Looking ahead to when we may have kids, London's state schools are also now the best in the country.  Also, house prices don't drop off as quickly as you might think as you go further out - your commute gets quite long (and expensive!) before it makes a huge difference.  And if my health does recover enough for me to work again, a day lengthened significantly by commuting will not be good for me.  In London we also don't need a car, which is a significant saving (particularly as my girlfriend gets free travel on the tube system).

So not quite ""need"" but on balance we'd currently rather pay a bit more to stay within the city limits and have a bit less money to live on.

No. The worst thing you can say about him is that he is on an ego trip and carrying you along with him. He hasn't achieved anything concrete at all. Point to a policy he's changed. Point to an affect he's had on government in any way. So what are we listening to his voice for? *At most* he has managed to convince thousands of people to not vote or engage with democracy because it's not perfect, which is just plain stupid. You only need to look at how the government treats the elderly to see that democracy does work when people vote consistently and in large numbers. If 18-30s voted at the rate of the elderly the government wouldn't be eyeing up their arseholes for another shafting, and he's made that situation worse. You need to engage with the system to change it, and he's just made this group easier to sideline and ignore.

Lobbying is a billion-euro industry in Brussels. According to Corporate Europe Observatory, a watchdog campaigning for greater transparency, there are at least 30,000 lobbyists in Brussels, nearly matching the 31,000 staff employed by the European commission..

I'm not an expert on this (in fact, to remind myself, I had to google ""3 criteria of bullying"" just now) and I don't hold those up as the rules to which adult abuse should be held to. 

But I think these rules show that these kinds of behaviours can be defined and policed - in the playground example, it's not bullying if no pattern of behaviour has developed, it's just a dispute or a fight (which, to some extent, is probably normal and healthy).

I think you're right to have reservations, but I don't think we should allow shitty things to continue just because we have difficulty defining exactly how shitty they are, or what makes them shitty.

Just from talking to him, you could tell it would have been a huge benefit to him if he'd gone, and it wasn't for lack of intelligence that had held him back.

On the other hand, out of my group of friends from school, 11/12 went to University. Two of these are studying medicine, I'm starting a PhD in September, one is studying maths and has been offered a job with a big finance firm, one is training to be a teacher, another is taking a Masters in Mechanical Engineering, and the rest have graduated. Of those who've completely finished, none of them have jobs that they couldn't have got before studying University, and one of the girls in this position said she basically went because everyone else was. So it's a bit of an odd mix - if we'd gone to the same school 30 years ago it's very unlikely any of us would have gone on to further study at all - many of our parents went to that school and most do manual labour kinds of jobs - but you get people who probably shouldn't go swept up in that.

My ex and I went with option three. The marriage wound up failing for a number of reasons (cliffsnotes version: you guys need to talk to each other) , but I can safely look back and say that eloping at a resort was probably one of the smartest decisions we made together. We spend a grand total of maybe $7k (including airfare) , had a week and a half long vacation/honeymoon, and the resort handled everything about the wedding. We just had to show up.

In light of which, your post seems to be somewhat lacking in veracity, and your assertion disproven by the two posts I have quoted above.

&gt;The protestations about being unable to heft ammo crates as effectively or drag bodies around or whatever other bullshit are a load of bunk if we're already letting them serve as medics, mechanics and cooks, which are physical, labour intensive jobs that require a great deal of conditioning and endurance.

The problem here is yes, while they already do serve as medics, mechanics etc, they have lower fitness requirements than the guys do. 
Does this make no sense at all, when you could be in a situation with some 5-foot-nothing female medic, in full battle rig (which is fucking heavy after a long day, believe me) having to pick up and run off with some injured Fijian monster (and his gear, too) on her shoulders? Yeah, it makes no sense. Holding females to a lower fitness standard than males makes no sense, and i'm sure serves only to make sure they hit more recruitment quotas.

The point a lot of the serving military guys here are making (and being downvoted for, go reddit) is that right now, today, women in the army can be less fit than their male counterparts in exactly the same role, which is not only unfair, its unsafe. Im all for women being infantry, the rape arguments and favouritism could have merit, but arent enough to scrap the whole idea as im sure there's some cold hearted bitches out there who would excel in the job. The problem lies in that ""The chain is only as strong as its weakest link"" and if females are allowed to be combat infantry, but are also allowed to do so at a lower level of fitness, they will only detract from the effectiveness of that section/platoon/regiment.

According to the reports of [Office for National Statistics](http://www.ons.gov.uk) there has been a reasonably significant increase in non-UK nationals living as residents in the UK since 2004 (1 in 11 people/8.9%) and 2013 (1 in 8 people/12.4%) and our population has increased rapidly since 2000 from around 0.3% growth PY to 0.8% growth PY in 2010 although it has slowed slightly since then (0.6%).  There has also been an increase in children being born in the UK to migrants retaining the nationality of their parents rather than adopting a British nationality.  Another factor is there seems to be a problem with population density where migrants tend to move to particular areas which can exasperate an issue to a greater extent than is obvious looking at the whole picture.  For example London's non-UK born population increased by 54% since 2001 and much of that is highly concentrated in certain boroughs (according to the London census).  I imagine there is a similar situation in places like Birmingham and Manchester etc.

Is it as bad or as important compared to other issues as it's made out in some of the media or Farage (aka the avatar of the Daily Mail) would have us believe?  No it's definitely not but there are issues and dismissing it is a mistake especially when people are being fed a ""sky is falling"" message by populist politicians.

Particularly good thoughts on the property ETF.  I think one can get round the issue of the level of equity risk just by making the investment smaller?  I think the real problem with it is the potentially poor correlation of these ETFs with London residential house prices - which could screw me badly if it goes wrong.  I'll download some data and look at historical correlations myself to get a better feel for this.  Will report back in case anyone is interested...

I'm sure you're right about the cash allocation.  Another reason for getting proper professional advice on this I guess.

My plan for my long term financial future, after buying a house, is actually to spend most of the capital by the age of 60 (just over 20 years away), rather than just living off the returns.  I have a pension starting at 60 that I should be able to live off and, given my experience of poor health, I do want to enjoy the next 20 years as much as I reasonably can.  You can't take it with you, after all, and if I run into financial problems later in life there will still be the equity in the house to tap into.

This will obviously need careful budgeting.  I've just bought YNAB and am trying to fill it up with data.  I was intending to assume a conservative 3% nominal return on my investments and a 2% inflation rate, then allow myself a starting annual budget, increasing with inflation each year, that is projected to leave me with £100k left over at age 60 - revisiting the whole arrangement periodically.  Again, obviously something to discuss with a financial adviser but your initial thoughts on the craziness of that approach would be really welcome.",0,1419002363,null,0,false,0,cmzltsg,t3_2pqe2q,t1_cmzltsg,t1_cmzg06y,null,1425317426,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

Immigration causes benefit tourism and is a drain on the economy. A myriad of studies show immigration has benefited the UK immensely and we are in a dominating position currently, being the single fastest growing country of any developed nation.

There is not much if any statistics that contradict this, plus people blaming the EU for dictating laws to the UK is immensly blown out of proportion and Farage continously uses a misquoted and out of context statement something like ""75% of laws are dictated by Brussels"" which is complete and utter bullshit, EU regulations effect about 12% of laws (thats to do with trade only) and only 3% of our laws are influenced by brussels outside of trade regulations.",0,1419003889,null,0,false,0,cmzmjxz,t3_2prvph,t1_cmzmjxz,t1_cmzm7ks,null,1425317086,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

To be getting any minutes at all in a Bayern team who have players like Robben, Ribery, Muller etc to pick from is surely indicative of his ability. For me, he can play a similar role to Lamela in the 'inverted winger/inside forward' position; but he offers something Lamela lacks: genuine pace. It's a shame, but I believe that given his lack of pace Lamela will eventually drift away from the wings and find his natural position as more of a no10, off the striker player. Obviously there'll be some tough competition.

I'm rambling on, but seeing as Poch seems to love inverted wingers, I would love to us play a genuine 443. Chadli cutting in from the left, Kane/Soldado/Hopefully a powerhouse striker like Bony through the middle, and a left footer with pace cutting in from the right (this is where Shaqiri would fit in). Then you could have Eriksen at the point of a three player midfield, with two more disciplined midfielder's behind him, one of whom is more defensive and one who is just a typical CM/box to box type (I.e Bentaleb/Mason/LilPaul/Dembele alongside Capoue/Stambouli). Them being primarily holding would allow two wing backs to play on either side of midfield whilst in possession, not too attacking, but them just being over the halfway line would push the opposing wingers back whilst we attack.

No offence but what mystifies me is people wanting a comedian to produce the solutions, or wanting him to become a politician!

As far as I see it, it's simple, all he is doing is occupying a role that needed occupying. Right now there is no-one in the political establishment for the left. Labour are not ""the working mans"" party anymore, they are basically Tories. Tories are still Tories. UKIP are Tories. Lib Dems might as well be Tories, they talk the talk but don't walk it. All of those parties support the current status quo 100%. Greens are ineffectual and full of stupidly contradictory policies.

So yes it may be an ego trip, but it's an ego trip with a net positive result for the rest of us. Unless you are one of few people who do defend the massive wealth imbalance we are experiencing, then like it or not Russell Brand is the only person with any public profile trying to bring the issue in to the mainstream with something other than the pessimistic message of ""it'll never change"".

He will eventually be replaced by the leader of the party which will emerge to fill the void. IMO he is doing something important, waking up people in the country that just thinking ""Oh well that's the way it is"" is a stupid line of thought... if he wakes up enough people, a political movement will start and then you will have the credible people step forward.

This lead to large cost increases at universities due to the need for more staff and more administration. Previously the universities were funded by government, but it was getting out of hand, so they put ""top-up fees"" in place, which were then increased a few years later.

Once the new government came in, it changed to what basically puts in a staggered 9% tax on graduates (9% on earnings above £21k). It might look like a loan, but it really isn't. It's just signing up to be taxed on your earnings. The return being that you theoretically earn more because you have the degree.

So in answer to your question, you're not meant to believe anything - you are given a choice and you can decide if you want (on average) a better wage but paying 9% extra tax on your earnings over £21k or (on average) a worse wage but without the tax. Your decision should probably factor in how well you think you'd do once you've got the degree. Obviously you're not an average, so you need to factor in your own personal feelings, wants and skills into that decision.

All these people did this and nothing happened of any consequence to anyone.

That's probably due to the amount it would cost to buy the rail and energy companies. It would be completely illegal to simply seize their assets.

Rail infrastructure is already nationalised, since the government were forced to give up their ""keep Network Rail's debts off the balance sheet"" charade. The only practical way to re-nationalise rail operations would be to let the franchises expire and give them to a nationalised body, but that would take until 2029 at least and would still leave the freight and open-access operators.

The fact of the matter is that the reason Liverpool were able to get him so cheap in the first place was because they were allowing him to spend a season back at Lille on loan. I don't know if I believe the 6 million euro fee to bring him to Liverpool early, but I'm sure it's not too far off, and so it should be -- he's a high-profile young talent who lead's the line for Lille every week and was Belgium's preferred no. 9 in the World Cup ahead of Lukaku.

You also have to consider that, if Liverpool were to go out and sign another striker, Origi would be coming into a team next summer with Sturridge, Balotelli and that would-be third striker ahead of him (unless we're just ready to cut our losses with Balo, which I think would be incredibly unfair).

The kid's a Liverpool player; Lille are terrible and I don't buy that he's ""building valuable experience"" over there. **If anything, this allows him to begin the transition to a new country, a new club and a new manager's style of player earlier, giving him ample time to bed in ahead of next year.** If anyone thinks he's being brought in to be our ""savior,"" that's they're problem because he's clearly not -- but he is another option in attack and a proper, pacy centre-forward in a team that's presently dying for one.

Actually you'll get that anyway, you just need to tell HMRC (one letter or phone call). They add on 25% automatically, and you can claim back the other 25% (£800 from your pocket becomes £1000 in the pension and £200 back to you, costing £600 for £1000 invested in total).

Salary sacrifice can work better because you're also not paying NI, so you get even more *and* you might be able to get your employer to chuck in a bit more since they don't have to pay employers NI on it either. 

But yeah, socking stuff away into your pension when you're in the 40% bracket is generally a really good idea however you do it (unless you've got high interest debts).

Here (by inference)...

&gt;""The word 'racist' has lost all meaning, it's just a word the left throws about willy nilly.""

According to you racism doesn't exist, its just a label used by the left for things they don't like.

FWIW I wouldn't describe myself as being on the left (or right for that matter the old paradigm ""left"" and ""right"" is clearly obsolete in this respect) do the left (for example) think hanging is a good punishment for murderers and rapists as I do?

So your attempt to label me as a ""leftie"" would also seem to be in error.

If a person uses the term ""Chinky"" to refer to the Chinese they *are* using a racist term, (in exactly the same way that those would use ""Nigger"" to refer to people of colour are) ...

 ... If when told it's racist, they then try to justify it and say ""racism is just a label thrown about by the left"" (as you did), it then becomes self-evident they are simply trying to justify remaining a racist.

If you don't want to be seen as a racist, you shouldn't then use racist expressions like ""Chinky"" or  ""Nigger"".

I think that's a very good way of putting it. Personally I don't think there's sense in accusing someone of being a racist bigot or whatever just for saying stuff that they've been used to saying all their life without much offensive intent behind them. If tolerance is your aim then you should be tolerant of the fact that the other person has come from a different background and culture to you. Plenty of older people still say the word faggot because it was a harmless insult for most of their lives, its status as an insult for gay people is rather recent (and probably not something that originated here). And then it gets more confusing with the number of gay people who call themselves and others faggots for the hell of it.

In so doing /u/EdShilliband  has stated **categorically** the word ""racism"" doesn't mean anything (it has lost *all* meaning) it's simply a meaningless word used by the left (to deter detractors). 

The only logical conclusion to that definitive statement made by /u/EdShilliband is that racism doesn't exist anymore.

This generation had/has a somewhat more holistic education, and received a different type of 'civics' than the generations of before.

Given that they are here, on Reddit, in r/uk, they are already more politically interested than the average of their age.
