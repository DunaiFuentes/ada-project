If you're looking for soft sand, clear water (its never totally clear around here), and a tide that rarely sends the water away more than ten feet, I would recommend [Bournemouth or Poole beach](http://d927g7hrg99yg.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/1.-Bournemouth-Beach-and-Surf-Reef.jpg?dd0558). This is also nice if you have a jet ski or some other such vehicle. The section closest to the shore, say half a mile or so out to sea, has a low speed limit for vehicles, to reduce the danger, but allow you to use a small anchor near less crowded parts of the beach. One person takes the boat or jet ski round to the beach, others meet them there. Its a nice day out. Watch out for the sandbanks though.

If you're looking for surf we all know about Newquay. Yes, they have the biggest waves. But I've heard people complain about how its become a bit of a party destination etc etc... If you want a quieter place with surf, then North Devon is ideal, [Woolacombe](http://www.bushidobudokai.com/images/woolacombe.jpg) or putsborough are ideal. Smaller surf but quieter. Putsborough is the campsite you see closest in the picture, Woolacombe is the town you see in the distance.

[Croyde Bay](http://www.parkdeanholidays.co.uk/global/img/devon/ruda/surfing/3.jpg), is a small beach with good surf. It doesn't allow dogs on the beach, which is something people complain about with Newquay and Woolacombe. The big issue is how much this beach suffers from overcrowding. In the height of summer, there are usually twice as many people as in that picture.... which makes surfing a bit of an obstacle course of beginners, inflatables, and families who are seemingly unaware of the designated red and yellow flagged swim zone.

There isn't enough of a credible to begin with so the case wouldn't go far enough for money to become a factor.

Illegal by what standards? US standards? International standards? EU standards? International Treaty Standards? And does illegal automatically mean crimes against humanity? I think not.

Governments spending money is not illegal on its own.

Deaths of who? Military men on either sides in combat? Not a war crime. Slaughtering civilians as targets is a war crime. Did Blair/Bush do that? Nope. And hundreds of thousands sounds like an over-statement.

&gt;which as a result , deaths are occurring today

No court would pin the actions of subsequent groups on Blair/Bush. You can't hold them to account for actions committed by a non-affiliated group. That would not stand a second in court. 

&gt;and was based on the fact of weapons of mass destruction , which wasn't found if i remember correctly

But did they actually know there were no WMDs there? How would you prove that?

I use cheques quite frequently on a personal level, paying for holidays and such. I could use Paypal or something like that, but I don't trust them after they almost let a scammer take money from me. (yes, them, I didn't fall for the scam but they tried to give my money away anyway)

I work in the financial sector and my business uses cheques every day for paying off creditors and such.

&gt;""Do not hog the right/middle lane""

I agree with your points on this one. People seem to forget than the legal speed limit is only 70. Yes yes ""the speed limit is arbitrary"" and ""Germany has no speed limit on motorways yet they have lower traffic accidents"", all that being said the law is still the law until they change it. If you care so much about it then become an MP or vote for an MP that vows to change it. If you want to break the law and do more in the outside lane that's your perogative, but don't risk your life and mine by tail-gating me, being an impatient little bitch in your BMW. If I'm overtaking the traffic in the inside lane (which is what the two other lanes are for) then leave me alone.

That he's the oldest actor so far to play the Doctor (at least since the re-launch) is even something that I think was a great decision. Capaldi's age and appearance is perfect for showing what a toll the events of the previous seasons must have taken on the Doctor, even if only mentally. He looks older not in the sense of weak and old, but older as in having seen too much and being somewhat world-weary, having too many scars on his soul to be as exuberant and happy-go-lucky as Eccleston's, Tennant's, and Smith's incarnations were or at least appeared to be.

Aside from that, Capaldi also appears more menacing than previous incarnations. While all three previous actors effortlessly managed to convey that messing with the Doctor was the biggest mistake one could possibly make, they never looked threatening or dangerous. Capaldi does if he wants to, and that fits perfectly with wanting to make the 12th Doctor darker than 9th to 11th.

Another thing is, I really love Japanese literature and film (classic). This might sound a bit random in this thread, but Japanese lit and film were a lot different than their American counterparts. It was based much more in social commentary and discovery of character. I remember a lot of people in my Japanese lit class absolutely hating it, but I really like that style of story telling. 

Reading through all the comments so far I am debating on how I want to go about watching the Classic Series. (I get really confused, because apparently in British English the word series means season? I think?) I'll probably take a look at the docs mentioned in the first comment to get some background and then decide if I want to start by watching specific episodes or just start at the beginning. Generally, I don't like to go out of order, and if I end up wanting to watch the whole Classic Series then it'll just frustrate me that I watched bits and pieces out of order. (I'm one of those people who can't start watching a movie I haven't seen if it has already been playing, even for 10 minutes. I blame being a filmmaking major in college. So much is established in the beginning of things.)

&gt;Biomedical research in Scotland enjoys a larger share of the national science budget in proportion to the size of its economy and it also benefits from substantial funding from UK-based research charities, which would have to be reconsidered if Scotland became independent, Mr Freeman will say.

This has already been refuted by the Director of Research Councils:

Sorry, I'm in work so my answer is a bit terse! I don't believe that biomedical research funding would be much affected and instead I think could be improved by an independent Scotland. The idea of being independent and being in control of our own finances means that the government (whoever was in power), could choose to allocate more.

Well considering that the police are made up of individuals with feelings, worries, personalities, reputations it's not so much what THE POLICE think so much as the people who make up the police force and who may be the victims of harassment or lose their jobs for perceived racism. It's not like the police have the best reputation when it comes to racial incidents. 

I'm arguing on behalf of the individuals who were worried about attaching their names to reports that labelled pakistanis as rapists and paedophiles for fear of the public backlash that may come with such allegations and how that would affect them. 

The Police itself couldn't give a fuck, but the people that have lives outside of the police obviously do care.

As for what to do about political correctness, we could stop encouraging political correctness by enabling all of the over-sensitive types that get so much media attention when they start crying about something.

I've seen the odd episode of the original series out of order on cable TV here in Austria when I was a kid, but I didn't know who or what Doctor Who was at that time (being from mainland Europe in the 1980s, i.e. pre-internet times, didn't help).

As such, I can only talk about the changes from 9th to 10th Doctor, 10th to 11th, and 11th to 12th, and it has always taken me a couple of episodes to get used to and starting to like the latest incarnation of the Doctor. I regretted (and still do) that Eccleston played only in one series, cried tears (men-tears, but tears nonetheless) when Tennant said ""I don't want to go"", and I was moved by Smith's ""I will always remember when the Doctor was me.""

Yet this time, with Capaldi as the new Doctor, there is not getting-used period for me. Maybe it's because I already knew the actor (even though only from DW s4e2 ""Fires of Pompeii"" and Torchwood's ""Children of Earth""), or because he was very briefly shown (at least his eyes) in ""The Day of the Doctor"". Or maybe it's because I felt it was time that the Doctor became a bit darker, and Capaldi was a great choice for that.

I really can't tell, but I'm very happy with Capaldi as the 12th Doctor. I hardly can wait until next Saturday.

In the case of the article you linked, no, there was no reason to call the police racist, unless there was other evidence that suggested the reason why relatives weren't informed was specifically racially motivated. But a handful of injustices is no justification for adopting the bad side. 

In this South Yorkshire incident though, there is a case for the police being racist. It's almost a kind of warped ""positive racism"" where it's worked out better for the rapists who happened to be an ethnic minority because they've evaded trouble purely because of their race. That is evidently incredibly harmful for society. It is a form of racism and needs to be treated as the same as ""traditional"" racism would be handled.

Basically, even though the nominal amount of money going to charity has increased every year, these increases are pretty much only down to increasing incomes and not an increasing portion of incomes being spent on charity. 

While you can definitely make the case that isn't the best way of looking at it, it's not controversial to state that it's been a *huge* issue for charities to try and increase this percentage. If people are only ever giving 2% of GDP to charity, it means that it doesn't really matter what the charity sector does on the whole. Individual charities can increase the slice of the pie they get, but they can't make the pie bigger.

And make no mistake - they have tried *hard* to prove that these executive salaries and expensive fundraising efforts are worth it. They succeed at showing that to their own board, but they utterly fail to show that they're increasing the relative amount people give to charity, and that's what actually counts if you want to make an argument in favour of higher ""re-investment"" of funds.",0,1409151367,null,0,false,0,ck1vq41,t3_2epkt5,t1_ck1vq41,t1_ck1v0yy,null,1427334697,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,beyondReturn,null,null,"We will play both 433 and 41212, I'm wondering which one BR will start with. It probably comes down to which of Markovic and Balo is more fit to play 2/3 of the game.


They will have quick CB pairing in Kaboul and Vertonghen, with Dier being able to move there (also quick) if there are any injuries, so we should expect them to at least give us a fight when we counter. Their expected fullbacks are still young and should be less of a challenge for both Markovic and Sterling. 


In their midfield they would have 2 anchors and with Eriksen (or maybe Lamela?) to sit in front. This works in our favor due to Gerrard not being able to cope well with 2 attacking midfielders running around him. Very likely to start Bentlab which decreases the risk of playing Coutinho (Sandro/Dembele next to Capou would screw us however) in 3 man midfield along Hendo. Eriksen will easily get past Gerrard, but that at least leaves us with one of Hendo or Coutinho getting past their midfield, Capou isn't rapid and Bentlab is still inexperienced despite being talented, Coutinho should have easier time dealing with him than Schneiderlin/Wanyama.

For their attack, it's still all over the place, the sort of creativity and ingenuity that can either help you embarrass a team or simply not come off, none of what they did against QPR seems drilled, the free runs and movements will collapse against a better organized team until they have been doing it for months. It's Arsenals scary early season movements before it all collapsed in the test of time.  Lamela and Eriksen might move around, but I can't personally see them moving with the same freedom if they have to track back against our high pressing side. We arguably only have Sturridge who is doesn't track back or press on the same level as our other players, they will have Adebayor, Lamela and Eriksen. MP has his plan, but it takes months to get players to press effectively (ex. Coutinho only starting in Jan 2014). I think MP will be naive much like BR in his first season, he will take the previous results for more than they told and set up with high defensive line, of course we will do the same, but I believe he will overestimate Kaboul and Vertonghens pace. They will still perform far better than teams who did that against us last season mainly due to the pace of Kaboul and Vertonghen combined with Lloris who will see 40 yard passes before they happen, but a mistake or two will likely happen. Should he not be naive and sit back, we will finally have the option of bringing on Balotelli if he doesn't start that is.


Our weakness is in high line combined with Mignolets unwillingess to come out out of the box and Skrtels/Lovrens lack of pace. Luckily for us we made that same mistake against City so we should be working on it. Adebayor isn't that quick himself and Lamelas pace is still a bit deceptive, have yet to see him running in straight lines, but he seems to have far better acceleration than he has speed, or it might just be him being careful after being out a season, in which case we are lucky to be playing him so early. Eriksen and Chadli are in the same category, neither are too quick and Lennon is out of favor/form. This is a team that will trouble us far less than when Lennon and Bale were running at us couple of seasons ago.

If we start with Markovic he and Sterling should be able to beat their fullbacks, but it's their defense that worried me, they will be able to bully Sturridge and beat him in the air, so we will have to rely on counter-attacking football to get Sturridge behind their back. But BR used 433 for control, he ordered out wide forwards to track back to the point where every attack was starting slow, I'm wondering if it's going to backfire. Sturridge doesn't thrive in slow build up, our wingers will only be able to cross into a packed defense, and Coutinho will be nullified. If we go for diamond first half with Balo up top, he will hold off one of the center backs (Kaboul is likely) while Sturridge gets 1v1 against Vertonghen. Due to their width (and them being home) they will keep the ball for longer and stay in control, but we will be able to counter or even cross if needed due to our threat in the box (Balo from crosses and Studge from second balls/back post crosses).

We look far more dangerous in 41212 and that's what I will go for, hoping that Spurs push up and play high line first half. Starting:

true,RedditMcRedditor,nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"Stagecoach upper management run the buses into the ground instead of getting them fixed properly.

They also schedule routes insanely tightly for drivers, meaning any delay caused by traffic or roadworks has a huge knock on effect for other buses because they don't keep the same driver on the same bus all day. So one driver delayed by 10 minutes in the morning causes delays on any other routes they were supposed to take over later on. 

Say you have 4 routes. 

A to b

C to d

E to f

Get to h

The A to b driver is delayed for some reason by just 10 minutes. That driver is then taking over the C to d route later on, meaning they take some delay with them because their routes are scheduled tightly meaning they can't always make up the time. 

This causes the C to d route to run late, and if the A to b route bus is being changed to another route, it also causes that route to run late.

Best case scenario is the bus is staying on that route so only 2 routes are affected.

Worst case scenario is that the driver has to have his mandated break, is switching to another route and another bus, and needs to swap with the other driver for the same run, meaning multiple routes are now suffering delays.

true,hello_fruit,null,null,"For what it's worth, I'm familiar with this website and others because I did have a phase of trying out inexpensive supermarket wines over this past winter. What I eventually settled on after basically researching them, and what you may find inexpensive, quite good, and very versatile, is sherry (aka jerez wine). It is higher than 12% but the plus to it is that you can drink it over a longer period. It goes really well with meats, cheese, nuts and chocolate; basically everything. You can also mix it 50/50 with lemonade (Schweppes is best) to make a drink called rebujito, which is currently my favourite drink by far. I personally prefer oloroso and amontillado, but manzanilla and fino are other sherry varieties to try. You can also try sherry rich cream, pale cream, et cetera. 

Get yourself a sherry glass, known as a copita, try out some sherries, and enjoy. I was quite shocked by how good it is. The sainsbury's range is the best I'd tried, if you can find a sainsbury's near you, but others should be ok too. You will never get higher quality wine per low price than sherry. It's sublime. 

You can also try Portuguese sherry-like wines like Madeira and Port. 

If it's mainstream wine that you must have, then I'd look into new world wines like Hardy's. American and Australian wines are produced in large quantities (hence the joke that they're refineries - like for crude oil - and not wineries), scientifically with much modern technology, and are consistent quality for the low price. Old world wines, like French and Italian, are still more of an art, smaller production volumes, and tend to be more inconsistent and higher in price.

&gt;You say a trial on what standards , trial by the west's standards ?

I've covered this already. When I say 'west standards' I mean the judicial philosophy that the west, generally speaking, adheres to. It has nothing to do with the laws that exist. Only the judicial process.

This sentence doesn't make any sense.

Try to understand this; just because you think that it is unlawful does not mean it is. Or just because you think it should be unlawful *does not mean it is.* You can't prosecute people based off your own personal opinions about should and should nots. That defeats the very principals of the western judicial philosophy.

I don't think removing Hussein (a dictator) out of power was helping him out...

Absolutely.  And I have no doubt that the researchers had no intention at all of suggesting that robots would replace sheep dogs at any time in the near future.  Rather that they could learn from the strategies that sheep dogs use rounding up sheep and apply them to other areas.  As the article goes on to say:

&gt; “The algorithm may be applied to situations where people have little information and there is a tendency to imitate the behaviours of each other, this is especially common where visibility is poor, and people need escape from a smoky room,” the authors conclude in their report.

I imagine the journalist rang up a sheep farmer and asked him a loaded question like ""What do you think about robots replacing sheep dogs?"" just to get an interesting quote and create a bit of ""controversy"" to spice up the article.

You probably would get a bigger house, but you'd also need to drive everywhere, and they don't really have nice towns and villages like the UK.

You would also have to deal with an even more divided society than the UK. Gang violence and guns everywhere. Tipping your waitress, taxi driver, hairdresser, guy who holds the door for you and everybody else would drive me mental too.

As for friends, I'm not sure. I always feel that Americans are more friendly on the surface but also more shallow, and would be less loyal and more cliquey than British friends.

This debate is turning to profiling people and cultures rather than addressing the systematic principles (not failures) that allows this to take place. And I don't mean fear of racist reprisal, to me that's a load of bollocks. 

There are far worse examples, in our own modern history, of abuse of women and children by ""our"" people, i.e not foreigners.

2.  Centerbacks spread wide when we're on attack.

3.  Capoue drops to pick up balls and to assist in defense.  When the fullbacks are caught too far up, we temporarily play a 3-4-3, with Capoue as a third CB.

4.  Lamela and Eriksen switch positions, but not when we're moving forward.  On attack we keep our width, but in the final third the players are allowed to get creative based on situation.  If Chadli attacks wide, Lamela and Eriksen crash to the center.  If Lamela attacks centrally, Eriksen and Chadli move wider.  I don't think it is nearly as haphazard as ""just facking run around"" Sherwood style.

If I had to pick a way to break us down, I'd think it would using 2 players attacking the center of the pitch.  I was most scared of Liverpool when I saw that beautiful ball in week one from Henderson to Sterling, who exploited the width at the middle of the pitch.

I've lived out here for just over a year and picked up stuff that A) would have been gone in 30 seconds at a car boot sale in Edin and B) was really cheap. Also go to the charity shops in North Berwick - you can get the train and they are really good. Rich little seaside town means good shops that haven't been stripped to the bone by students etc.

Also East Fortune market is good for car boot sale stalls and mega cheap fruit, veg and meat from the butchers auction which is waaay better than supermarket drivel (5kg of huge chicken breasts for £25). You can haggle with the butcher on bulk purchases and fill up the freezer.

Out at Newcraighall there is a little (but good) car boot sale as well on Sundays I think, and there is also one at Seafield (near Leith) on Saturdays next to the sewage works (if it has rained recently it ain't bad).

The law IS complicated because there are so many possible variations. And now we have a highly connected world where

But, to simplify, think of what we do know, and what we do want.

Do we want these people to become ""radicalised"" in the first place? No. Clearly not. So there should be action taken to prevent this such as closing down mosques where this is preached, and by closely monitoring website spreading this stuff. Some people should also be prosecuted for spreading this ideology. I'm sure Benway or some other dipshit is going to whine about this being totalitarian, but it's practically impossible to fight against extremism using principles of tolerance.

Do we want these people going there? Not really. But it's hard to stop them going since they can fly to other countries then cross the border. But we can certainly use intelligence to guess WHO might be going over there to fight, and who isn't.

Are we comfortable with our intelligence services following them while they are over there? IMO, yes. 

Do we want them to commit crime over there? No. And if they DO commit crimes, do we want them to be held accountable? Yes, definitely. 

Should being British give them any sort of immunity or special treatment against being prosecuted? I don't think so.

Should being British give them any immunity from being killed by allied forces or by our own guys? Again, I don't think so. If they have taken the side of the enemy, it's fair.

If they DO participate in fighting, recruiting or helping the terrorists over there, do we want them to come back to the UK? IMO, no, we don't. But maybe we can't stop them, apart from withdrawing their passports and stranding them.

If they DO come back, do we want them to go free and ""re-join"" society? IMO, no. I think they would be very dangerous. So they need to be held accountable for what they've done. And if that isn't provable, they should certainly still be watched. Again, it all sounds very draconian, but there isn't much alternative. These people don't play by the rules and I think ~600 guys coming back to the UK after joining ISIS is incredibly bad news. Even if we can't find evidence to prosecute all 600, they certainly deserve to be put under surveillance IMO because they are at very high risk of plotting some sort of attack here.

2. This has some challenges:

Firstly you might offer higher remuneration to keep a good CEO in tough economic times or during a rocky transition. The company might go from £20m profit to £20m loss, but if the board was bracing itself for a £50m loss the CEO did *well* to mitigate.

Secondly, there is a degree to which you have to be offering a serious remuneration package to attract talent of any kind. You don't get the candidates through the door otherwise.

&gt;
&gt;Before the Eleventh Doctor's 200-year farewell tour between TV: *The God Complex* and *Closing Time*, the writers of the 2005 revival of the series explicitly described the Doctor as around 900 years old, despite contrary statements on TV and expanded media. It is one of the few notable contradictions of previously established material in the revival. To date no episode, novel or comic strip has addressed the discrepancy.
&gt;A simple and self-evident theory is that the Doctor doesn't know how old he is because he has lost count, constantly travelling backward and forward through time making it difficult to measure one's lifespan at all. This theory began as fanon, with the Doctor occasionally admitting to being unsure of his age in spinoff media (COMIC: *Doctor Who and the Time Witch*, PROSE: *Vampire Science*); eventually it became solidified as canon in a televised story. (TV: *The Day of the Doctor*), although the War Doctor's immediate response suggesting he was 400 years younger than the Eleventh complicates matters.

With Hollowpoints, probably not. I'm not a ballistics expert of course, but the whole point of them (aside from not passing through the target and hurting bystanders) is that that they expand inside the body and [mushroom](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/Proload.png), causing huge internal damage. Furthermore, because they stay inside the target instead of passing through, all their kinetic energy is transferred to the target. I'd imagine a couple, or less than 10, anyway, would be sufficient. 

Having said that I think De Menezes was hit 8 times out of 11 shots with hollowpoints. Not that I'm condoning that of course, but I suppose it depends on how the individual officer sees the situation. 

&gt;   I take it you've seen waterloo. If you open fire in there, there's pretty much no direction you could shoot where you wouldn't hit someone.

Again, I've no idea about the training armed officers go through, but unless there was no alternative, I'd hope they'd be able to aim / time their shots in order to avoid bystanders. I mean they're not gonna want to shoot unless they have a clear shot, I'd imagine.

true,dfmacca,cnty-scotland,Edinburgh,"Aberdeen exemplifies the problem with bus services across the rest of the UK perfectly.

First Buses (where Aberdeen is their HQ for the whole of the UK) have a monopoly and so hike up their prices whenever they see fit. They raised the prices of single journey tickets three times in three years. If you're a student and going more than one journey, it's cheaper to buy a day ticket at £3.50 (which, in 2011, were £3) than to get a single, which usually costs £2.70. Single tickets in Edinburgh cost £1.50.

Buses are normally late, and the drivers/inspectors are the rudest individuals I have ever met. One time my friend protested to a ticket inspector as to why have the ticket prices gone up for a third time, to which the inspector replied, ""so I can make more money"".

Matt Smith phoned Clara from the past using the phone on the phonebox. Does this mean we will ""hear"" more from Doctors in the past?

They brought back a premise about Madame de Pompadour. Could this mean there will be a lot of flashbacks to previous plots that weren't fully resolved at the time? I sure hope so.

The first involved not only a sea barrier but there was the complete lack of modern day integrated economic systems such as supermarkets, power grids, human capital, educational industries, service industries etc. etc. etc. etc. etc.

The second situation was also one where economies that were not that heavily integrated with each other cut themselves off from each other due to war. Not only is the whole economy of Britain incredibly closely linked today, but war is an extreme political act and is completely out of the scope of the current situation.

So, no, I guarantee you that the rest of the UK will not damage its economy unnecessarily, and neither will an independent Scotland, to score a few nationalistic points. Both sides will do everything in their power to maintain economic integration at the level it is today. England will not throw away the Scottish market and Scotland will not throw away the English market.

I dont know what you get from above lines or somehow english in India and in Britain have some other meaning, Let me put it this what and how average Indian deduces from above lines

so in europe was peaceful world there were no waring states?

&gt; united them under a model,

annexed with divide and rule policy, 

 &gt; bringing infrastructure and 'civilisation' by evangelical Victorian moral standards, and ruled it with a a tiny amount of civil servants for roughly 250 years

Creating railways to transfer goods so that British east India company can loot lot more easily is not good neither did the boards that put on railways ""Indian and dogs are not allowed"" helped any Indians, Probably in britain they dont teach these thing but its true only certain coaches Indians are allowed to travel earlier days

&gt; As the sun set, financially, the UK gained nothing from the Empire and its financial drain ended up speeding the demise.

If UK gained nothing why on earth more Indians soldiers are dead in WWs than those of britain soldiers.
What about millions of people who are dead due  artificial famines in India during raj so UK can support its war against its neighbors. 

What about market that 300 million strong market for British finished goods? what about trade that UK generated from monopoly it has on India.  

or do you think that UK is ethically trading with India to export Indian goods to europe but some how Indian trade with rest of world was 25 -17% in 1700 to  just under 1% in 1947.

The problem with the original BSG is that it was picked because it was very, very bad.

ABC picked it up because Star Trek/Wars made people crave Science-Fiction and they thought that having a SF series would bring people to their network. They chose the worst series they could find in the hope that they could cancel it due to poor ratings (SF is expensive) and people would stay for the sitcoms (which are cheap to produce).

The thing they didn't anticipate is the pull of ""no other SF series on TV"".

And their plan didn't work at all, people did not stay for their sitcoms after they cancelled BSG.

Not necessarily. There could be other unconsidered factors. 

If we had a community that happened to wear blue jumpers and we had more vandalism in that area, I wouldn't think people would suggest blue jumpers cause vandalism. 

This is all a complex problem and I'm not saying the Muslim community is not at fault. 

I'm from Birmingham and some of the opinions of Muslim men that I encounter are a little backward and outdated. Particularly towards women. The question is whether there is a part of their culture that they inherit which promotes these undesirable traits and whether our integration policies are sufficient in tackling them.

If the police want to shoot someone, what does it accomplish? I don't think it's a logical solution to preventing them from using a device, as I mentioned, so what is the point? To stop them running away? Just hire bobbies who aren't fat and chase on foot...

I don't like the idea of the BTP shooting lots of bullets for no good reason in a crowded public place. I don't believe they'll land 100% of shots on target, and I believe there's a high chance of innocent bystanders being hit by stray bullets, one way or the other.

As the players come out a song called the liquidator plays. To follow this one just listen to everyone around you, but it sounds like this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuH0rHFWvM8

The only words you chant are Chelsea, and there is a clapping rhythm, but its simple. 

blue is the colour is another famous chelsea song, the verse which people might sing is:

Blue is the colour
Football is the game
We’re all together
 And winning is our aim
 So cheer us on through the sun and rain
Cos chelsea, chelsea is our name 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZYfi_Ex_gM


Carefree (to the tune of lord of the dance):

Carefree wherever you may be.
We are the famous CFC,
And we don't give a fuck whoever you may be!
'Cos we are the famous CFC!

The Willian song:

The shit from Spurs bought his flight.
But Will-I-An Saw the light!
He got the call from Abramovich!
So off he went to Stamford Bridge!

He Hates Tottenham!
He Hates Tottenham!
He Hates Tottenham!
And He Hates Tottenham!

Chelsea boys:

Hello, hello we are the Chelsea boys, 
Hello, hello we are the Chelsea boys,
And if you are a Tottenham fan surrender or you’ll die, 
We all follow the Chelsea.

Everything after is a bit up and down. Each Doctor has some fantastic stories but others were outright awful. The 5th Doctor's era began a bit dull due to criticisms of Tom Baker's era stating that it was too gothic, complex and frightening to children (I personally think this was the peak of classic Who in terms of the stories). I recall reading that after Peter Davison's first season, he demanded they not dumb down the stories and write more complex stories as he found it difficult to work with scripts that were dumbed down for younger audiences. His era later culminated as being a very successful one but after that, things became very hot and cold. To me this sudden change in writing despite being quickly rectified was a catalyst to the downfall of the classic Doctor Who. But personally, the easiest eras to watch if you are accustomed to nuWho are probably the 4th Doctor's era and Peter Davison's era (after his first season). The pacing for Hartnell and Troughton was slower but still very enjoyable and while the pacing was very comparable to nuWho during Pertwee's era, the fact that he was stuck on earth for a lot of it might be a tough pill to swallow for some but still a fantastic era.

Another pernicious effect is that the politicians whose own kids go to private schools get to determine the education system for the rest of us. With no real skin in the game, what do they care what fucked up theories get foisted on the hoi poloi? 

For example the disastrous comprehensive system that's hobbled kids for generations was introduced by public school boy Tony Crosland in the 1960s.

If you have one grandparent born in the UK and you can prove it (by requesting their birth certificate from the National Archives, for example) you can get a five year ancestry visa, which lets you live, work and study in the UK but not claim any government help such as unemployment benefit. You are entitled to bring dependents (spouse or civil partner) with you.

Your grandparent must have been born either in the UK/Channel Islands/IoM, in Ireland before April 1922, or on a British-registered ship or aircraft. 

The only requirements are that you can prove that you have sufficient financial resources to establish yourself in the UK and that you can send documents proving these facts. 

The application takes about 3 weeks and costs £289. You can apply either to extend your ancestry visa, or you can apply for indefinite leave to remain in the UK upon the expiry of your first visa.

&gt;Bamford, who has scored 25 goals in 52 appearances for MK Dons and Derby this season, got to meet Mourinho face to face in March, when Michael Emenalo, Chelsea’s technical director, asked him to come to Cobham along with his father, Russell. “Because I was doing well at Derby and I’d done well at Milton Keynes, it was a discussion about that and the planning for next year,” Bamford says. “They were hinting at a new contract but I don’t know yet what’s happening there.”

&gt;Bamford smiles when asked how he found Mourinho. “The first thing he said to me was: ‘What do you want to do next season?’ As quick as I could I said: ‘Play for Chelsea.’ He said: ‘That’s good, at least you know what you want. We’ll see.’

As for our fullbacks, our RB, whoever starts, will push up far to provide width on the right side. Lamela cuts in a lot and doesn't really provide all that much width.

I'd expect Adebayor starting up top. Look for him to drift wide left and for Chadli to tuck into the CF role. That can create separation and can leave Chadli unmarked in front.

Vertonghen will be lined up next to Rose, so if you're counting on long through balls catching Rose out of position, Verthonghen has the reading of the game and pace to cut them off. He was terribly out of form last season but the season before was on the PFA Team of the Year. He looks to be back to his best so far this season.

Expected lineup:

              Lloris

Naughton - Dier - Vertonghen - Rose


         Capoue - Bentaleb

     Lamela - Eriksen - Chadli

             Adebayor

According to the FA's website, Naughton's suspension is up and I haven't heard anything about Walker being fit.

&gt;It's like those fucking Facebook posts where they say ""only people who hate cancer will share""

No, it's really *fucking* not.

I'd say that it's more accurate to call it a pile of self-indulgent, self-justifying bollocks.

For fun. Raises awareness. And Money. It's been done before, you know - but carry on describing everyone *in the world* that's done it under a single dismissal. Doing so has worked out *so well* before.

&gt;if people wanted to donate then they would anyway

So said no successful fundraiser ever. It's apparent just how much actual thought you've given this.

&gt;and then people then call you out for hating disabled people if you don't wanna do it

Haven't seen a single person lambasted for not doing it. But then, I haven't seen anyone else in a froth attempting to dismiss the entire thing either.

true,VincentKompanini,null,null,"&gt; The way I see it, someone with a bomb or bio weapon can activate it before you can shoot them, if they're smart, they'll have a dead man's switch. If the police want to shoot someone, what does it accomplish? I don't think it's a logical solution to preventing them from using a device, as I mentioned, so what is the point? To stop them running away? Just hire bobbies who aren't fat and chase on foot...

Well yeah, guns are  obviously totally ineffective if the bomber detonates before he's noticed or before police get a chance to stop him... But there might be stand-off situations or a Mumbai bombing type event where firearms have a use.


&gt; I don't like the idea of the BTP shooting lots of bullets for no good reason in a crowded public place. I don't believe they'll land 100% of shots on target, and I believe there's a high chance of innocent bystanders being hit by stray bullets, one way or the other.

I don't like the idea of them shooting for no good reason, who would? They'll have good reason for bringing guns to bear. Sure, there have been incidents where the police have been at fault for using guns, but I have confidence in the training of the vast majority of armed police. They're not any old police kicked out onto the beat with an assault rifle, they're trained to use guns - they ain't just gonna start firing off rounds willy nilly into the crowd in the hope they hit a bad guy. I imagine at the least they'd know / have orders not to shoot if there was any chance of hitting a civilian.

For what its worth, we could look at some recent shootings. The police fired 11 shots at de Menezes at close range, 8 of which hit him and 3 of which didn't - but they didn't hit anyone else either. Mark Duggan was hit twice from two shots, as was David Sycamore, and Anthony Grainger was killed with a single shot. What I'm saying is the police have a decent track record of only shooting the people they intend to shoot.

&gt; If there really is a need to put people down, then why not use tazers?

Whilst I agree that tasers should always be used where possible, I believe there are a few disadvantages to them in a situation where many lives might be in danger. 

Firstly, they're relatively short range devices, which limits the options the police have when dealing with a target. Secondly, they're usually stored on belts/holsters, not carried. If the situation is one in which every second counts, the officer would have to drop their rifle, and draw the taser. Its going be be a lot quicker for the officer to bring to bear a rifle that they're already holding.",0,1409159173,null,0,false,0,ck1zo5d,t3_2eq9kn,t1_ck1zo5d,t1_ck1yd4v,null,1427332857,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Anyway, worse case senario they don't register your deposit within 30 
days: 

&gt;What happens if a deposit has not been protected?
Where a landlord fails to comply with Tenancy Deposit Protection, there are two sanctions:
Unable to use Section 21 notice
Under Section 21 of Housing Act 1988, a landlord can serve two months' written notice on a tenant in order to terminate a tenancy at the end of a fixed term, or after a fixed term has expired. However, where a landlord fails to comply with Tenancy Deposit Protection, no Section 21 notice may be given in relation to the tenancy until the legislation is complied with.


&gt;Payment to the tenant
Tenants can make an application to a County Court under the Housing Act 2004 if they believe that their deposit is not being safeguarded, or where they have not been given the prescribed information about the scheme in which the deposit is safeguarded within 30 days of the landlord receiving the deposit.
Where the court is satisfied that the landlord has failed to comply with these requirements, or the deposit is not being held in an authorised scheme, the court must either order the landlord to repay the deposit within 14 days of the making of the order, or order the landlord to pay the deposit to the custodial scheme administrator.


&gt;The court may also order the landlord to pay the tenant up to three times the deposit amount within 14 days of the making of the order.

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"Social mobility is a huge problem and I think more should be done to help people from under-privileged backgrounds get decent educations.

But I don't like the tone of these kinds of articles where they are sometimes suggesting that all these people in top positions with good educations are only there because of ""Elitism"", and not because they also worked hard to get where they are, and they shouldn't be ashamed for having been lucky enough to have a good education to help them get there.

Furthermore, many people like to point the finger of blame to the universities like Oxford. They forget the true purpose of universities, which is **not** an instrument of social mobility. The purpose of univerisity is to pick out the best and give them the best education so they can become the best workers. The difficulty is in picking out the best from poor backgrounds since it is difficult to compare their abilities with richer students when their education up to that point is so much less stringent.

I think Oxford does this well. They spend a lot of money and attention to give greater opportunities to applicants based on their background. But they still have to meet academic requirements. What more can they do? They can't just hand out places to people *because* they're poor.

The only way to fix this imbalance is to go right to the source, which is the comprehensive schools. If our state schools can come close to the quality level of the private schools, then the top universities will have a much easier time picking out the smartest instead of the richest, and from there, the top jobs will go to the smartest and not the richest/most well connected.",0,1409160124,null,0,false,0,ck206k1,t3_2eqduu,t1_ck206k1,t1_ck1zns3,null,1427332606,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Driving everywhere is correct if you live in suburbia or the western cities. However some of the major cities you can get by without. Besides, gas is hellishly cheap. I think what got me the most about continental US cities, is what they call 'downtown' having no defined centre. It is just a mass of rectangular buildings. I suppose this is what happens when most your stuff is less than 200 years old. Still, they could do with having more central obvious meeting places. I found that smaller towns and protocities were better in this regard, although having a 4 lane road separating one side of the town from the other, in the middle of their 'highstreets', as quite perplexing.

Everything being blocks makes sense, logistically and from a road-planning perspective. But damn does it make walking around a pain. But as you say, most areas are not designed for walking.

Got to say, I didn't really ever encounter gang issues. But the threat of guns was ever present. It worries me that so many clearly in need of mental help, wield such weapons. I remember quite clearly a McDonalds being shot up with a fatality a mere hour after I left it. It seemed not a week went by without a news report relating to gun violence somewhere close.

Tipping didn't bother me too much apart from remembering to do it and deciding and appropriate amount. I found that service personnel performed much better than our equivalents with such incentives. What did get to me was constantly trying to calculate tax, however.

I am not sure on the shallowness. A little superficial and materialistic, maybe, but not shallow. If anything I would accuse them of being more genuine and honest on the whole, than ourselves. I also fiercely disagree with the loyalty aspect relatively speaking. However I am used to people from the South East and London, of whom I regard as having some of the flimsiest loyalty I've ever encountered, anywhere. Got to disagree with the cliques too. Groups there are some of the most welcoming and expansionist I have ever met. Whereas here, I would regard our cliques as being very much more closed off, and even poorly held together. You are however quite right on their insecurity. You have to be very careful not to hurt their fragile egos or even use any form of sarcastic ribbing, especially with those from the West. They're quick to judge, quick to misinterpret, but also quick to forgive.

&gt;when you travel abroad you realise just how reserved we British are!

Yes. And in general, I am no fan of our reservedness. Still, compared to some Northern Europeans we're positively chatterboxes. We're somewhere between Scandinavian and Spanish, which isn't the worst place to be, but equally not the best. 

&gt;I absolutely hated LA.

Seconded. LA was truly is an example of humanity at its worst, sociologically speaking. The people there are just... something else. Super-Londoners almost with their self-importance. But go south to San Diego or north to San Fran (or better, Portland) and everyone is nice and friendly again.

I think there could be a need to focus on culture though because such things are bred within cultures - I'm not saying the culture actively breeds it, but that it breeds within the culture. It's then up to them to deal with it from within, or to be given the tools to do that. 

I'm not sure if it was you that mentioned catholic priests? But take that as a context: a few pervy priests led to a common assumption that all priests are perverts. Meanwhile, those priests who weren't involved turned a blind eye - i don't know why. The best way to deal with it would be for the non-perve priests to stop, or at least speak out against, the few perverts. So yeah, you can't blame catholic priests for child abuse, but you can say that they didn't do enough to help because they chose not to take action against the few. They knew what was happening, but ignored it, for whatever reason. Of course, I know it's not easy for them to just 'speak out': they might be speaking out against superiors, in one guise or another, and then be cast out; or they could be seen as bringing shame to the culture of priesthood, with the majority wanting to sweep it under the carpet. I really don't know how you can tackle that sort of thing, because you have to be a part of the culture, or at least be able to influence it, in order to do anything. While we're sorting out the best way to tackle it, kids continue to be abused.

Many people (including me) like to imagine that we can somehow make the world truly *fair*, in that everyone will have equal wealth and success because everything is distributed fairly and equally.

But the fact of the matter is that we are not born equal, neither physically or mentally. Biologically, we are all different in some way or other and some will be born with a natural ability which earns them wealth and success in the future.

However, natural *talent* is neither sufficient nor absolutely required for success, so upbringing, culture and most importantly, education have an immense hand in deciding whether the talented child truly achieves their potential, or languishes in mediocrity, or whether the child who never gives up and always tries his best achieves great success way beyond their expected potential.

Education is necessary to bring out the potential in every child. And every child should be allowed the opportunity to show what they can do with a great education, because you never know where the next genius who saves our planet could come from. As Anton Ego puts it in Ratatouille: Not everyone can become a great artist; but a great artist *can* come from *anywhere*.

So I think schooling up to 16/18 years old should be focused on allowing every child to show their greatest potential in whatever it is they do well, whether it be maths, sports or sheer bloody-minded determination. Universities are then charged with selecting the most promising and developing them into the best they can be. But universities can't do this if they can't properly select the best from *all* the children, not just the rich ones.

true,youhadmeathelo,null,null,"I haven't seen Classic Who yet, obviously, but I do love my fair share of classic Sci-Fi. I also have an appreciation for the classics of other genres as well. Try to look at it this way: the quality of an artistic medium that is constantly evolving, innovating, and advancing such as television and film cannot really fairly be judged by things such as special effects, fancy camera work, elaborate sets, etc., etc. It's important to realize that television especially faced tremendous challenges in terms of budgets and whatnot in the past. Due to new technology and networks like Showtime &amp; HBO producing high quality production TV shows, viewers are starting to expect television production quality to be on par with that of movie production. And because technology that is able to produce high quality cinematography is rapidly becoming more affordable and accessible that means that television has been able to 'step up their game'. (As well as provide talented filmmakers the ability to create content they could have otherwise never have been able to afford to make.) 

So, when discussing the quality of a show, you really have to look past production value sometimes - especially when watching the classics. Sure, it can all seem so cheesy and fake in the face of what we can do now with media (in TOS a dog very much obviously in costume passed as an alien), but what makes these shows so groundbreaking is their content. TOS and TNG are filled with social commentary about the world we live in. And even though those shows are decades old, they still are relevant. I am excited to watch Classic Who because from what others have said it is very much the same way. So many films and TV shows produced in this generation will eventually be forgotten because they will be outdated, and people will say their 'quality' is bad. And in part, that will be true. Because the media that does manage to stick around throughout time is the media that has quality *content*. It's much more about just knowing the back story to Doctor Who. It's about embracing everything what Doctor Who is about and really engaging in the story and all the relevant commentary that story conveys about our own real world. When television is able to reach out beyond just being entertainment and remain relevant for decades then you know you have something truly special. 

I don't want to come across as condescending. I'm just trying to give you a different perspective when watching the classic episodes. And as /u/DoctorPoo25 said in a comment above the perceived production quality can become quite endearing once you really invest yourself in it.

true,GratefullyGodless,tennant,Tennant,"There are lots of theories about Missy, everything from her being The Rani, to her being Romana or River returned. But, my theory is that Missy is one of Clara's splinters. 

Remember, she jumped into his timestream to help stop the Great Intelligence, and she was splintered into various Claras, becoming The Doctor's Impossible Girl in the process. She jumped into the Doctor's ""corpse"" on Trenzanore, but the Time Lords changed things by giving the Doctor more regeneration energy, and thus he lives on and didn't die on Trenzanore.

So, now Clara and the Great Intelligence are still a part of the Doctor's timestream, and that means they should be appearing as splinters in his current and future regenerations as well as his past. 

We know that Clara has referred to The Doctor jokingly as ""her boyfriend"", and when Missy is talking to the repair droid at the end, she refers to the Doctor as ""my boyfriend"". Plus, she looks very similar to what Clara might look like in about 25 years or so. While she dresses anachronistically, so does the Doctor sometimes. The joy of being a time traveler is having a wide variety of fashions to choose from.

As for what she's up to, I believe she's preparing to stop the Great Intelligence when he reappears, and is gathering those she thinks may be able to help her do so.

   Plus, it allows Moffat to do one of his favorite things, which is loop back to earlier stories. Clara only hooked up with the Doctor, because Missy gave her the phone number, which led to Clara leaping into the Doctor's timestream, thus causing Missy to come into existence so she could send Clara the number, It's the kind of conundrum that Moffat loves to drop into his stories.

   So, am I nuts? Or. does this make a good amount of sense?

If you feel that it might be unwise to ask whether the departure of Martha will mean the end of the show's black fanbase, or whether the departure of Jack Harkness will lead to the end of the LGBTQ fanbase, then it's going to garner a very similar response asking about young females as if they were a homogenous group.

I'm sorry your female friends aren't excited about the show right now. However, unless there are about ten thousand of them, they are not a statistically significant indicator of viewership for a TV episode that had more than ten million viewers in the UK and US alone.

* Anthony Granger. Completely unarmed. Suspected of robbery.
* Mark Duggan. Unarmed, had apparently ditched gun before being intercepted. One round passed through him and hit another cop, who was mostly unharmed.
* David Sycamore. Had replica gun. Suicide by cop.
* Mark Saunders. Had empty shotgun that he'd fired several times out of a window over the preceding 5 hours. Had not fired in 20 minutes, was not pointing weapon. Was talking to officers, when 7 police officers fired 10 shots, hitting him 5 times.
* Ann Sanderson. Had air pistol. Likely suicide by cop.
* Abdul Kahar. Completely unarmed. Shot as part of a raid carried out on false intelligence. Survived.
* Jean Charles de Menezes. Completely unarmed. Completely the wrong guy.
* Azelle Rodney. Unarmed. Three pistols in boot of car. Shot 8 times, in 4 distinct bunches by one officer.

Literally none of these people had hurt anyone. Only one was carrying a lethal weapon at the time of their death, and had used it on the scenery. Another two were pretending they were. These three are the only times the shooting was actually justified. All the others except Duggan were found by the IPCC and/or CPS to be wrongful. Only one of the officers was charged (the guy who killed Azelle Rodney), nearly 9 years after the fact.

She mentioned a big Gvt Department and that was that. Soon after graduating she's working at the Ministry. Two years on another lunch, same question, this time she says journalism and soon she's on Fleet Street.

There is nothing bigoted about criticizing, ridiculing or even hating an ideology or religion (which to my mind is a type of ideology).  Not even in theory.  Bigots may certainly criticize Islam but that does not make criticism of Islam bigoted.  

Is my hatred unfair?  You tell me.  

Practically every chapter of The Quran contains violent fantasies about how non-believers are going to be tortured in hell-fire.  And as an atheist I'm all too aware that apostates and atheists can actually be killed in several Islamic states.

I also hate Islamic attitudes towards women.  There's a hadith which says that hell is full of nagging women.  It might be amusing if it were a joke, but it's not funny that people actually believe this.

I also think that Islam, like other religions before it, has the potential to be extraordinarily dangerous.  We're currently seeing an Islamist group attempt to make an Islamic state in the name of Allah.  Perhaps that has something to do with religion?

Islamism is Islam at its worst, but be very clear.  It's fascism.  It's the death of everything.

Historically, though, it must have been an important place to the local inhabitants, because there's just *so much history* lying about the place. There's a ruined twelfth century chapel. There's the ruins of a walled village that was occupied from the Iron Age right through the Roman period and into the Dark Ages. There's even a Neolithic burial chamber that's over four thousand years old just lying next to the road. To put that in context, that burial chamber predates not only the US, but the Roman Empire, the Persian Empire, the Qin Dynasty of China and the New Kingdom of Egypt. It's very old indeed.

&gt;__Göbekli Tepe__ (Turkish: [ɡøbe̞kli te̞pɛ],  ""Potbelly Hill"" ) is an archaeological site at the top of a mountain ridge in the [Southeastern Anatolia Region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Anatolia_Region) of [Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey), approximately 6 km (4 mi) northeast of the town of [Şanlıurfa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9Eanl%C4%B1urfa). The [tell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tell) has a height of 15 m (49 ft) and is about 300 m (984 ft) in diameter.  It is approximately 760 m (2,493 ft) [above sea level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Above_mean_sea_level). It has been excavated by a German archaeological team that was under the direction of [Klaus Schmidt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Schmidt_(archaeologist\)) from 1996 until his death in 2014.

true,Cyridius,irish,Ireland,"&gt;This iin't a one-off. Part of the problem is that people who draw attention to this are called racists or islamophobic.

They're called racists because the only demographic they're willing to look at is ""Muslim"". Or X or Y religion/ethnicity.

What people absolutely refuse to address or take into account is socioeconomic status of the people committing the crimes. Never do people take into account that they're working class, or that they're poorly educated, or that they're educated but jobless, or anything like that. It's always that they're strange, different people.

And that's because it's far easier to bitch and moan about foreigners coming into the country and not integrating and setting up small little isolated communities than it is to sit down and address the serious social and economic problems that allow these kinds of situations to occur in the first place, and this is why the problem is *not going away*. 

&gt;An oppressive regime of political correctness has contributed to the failure of the police and social services with a catastrophic tally of 1400 victims.

And yet, as a *contributor* and not the sole cause of this failure, why is it were are focusing so heavily on the racial aspects to it instead of addressing serious, institutional problems that are far more important than any make believe PC bullshit excuses the council wants to use?",0,1409166553,null,0,false,0,ck23o9q,t3_2eoqjz,t1_ck23o9q,t1_ck1rkqy,null,1427330977,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

In Time of the Doctor she's clearly been living on her own for a while, previously she was shown to be living with the Maitlands.

It was also implied that many of her adventures in the TARDIS were essentially weekend holidays/vacations for her, implying that one episode could be a month or two after the previous. This likely accounts for a fair amount of time passed for her. 

This also accounts for the Titan Comics. 10s adventures in that series start sometime between losing Donna and End of Time while he was traveling alone (though apparently not always alone). 11s are set sometime between dropping the newlywed Amy and Rory off after their Honeymoon and 'The Impossible Astronaut'.",0,1409169848,null,0,false,0,ck25h8d,t3_2epskw,t1_ck25h8d,t1_ck21kkk,null,1427330135,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

I'm not saying that it's wrong or improper in any way to decide that you want money and job security over subject interest.

true,RifleEyez,null,null,"Yeah, someone posted a comparison between the two and you can see that from the stats Fazio is a much more intelligent player reading the game, so his lack of pace won't be as much of an issue positioning wise as he makes many more interceptions than Dawson as a result. Dawson made something like 2.1 per game, whereas Fazio made 3.3. Also, lots of Sevilla and La Liga fans have said ''shame Seville are losing their best players''...so obviously he carries some respect there. 

Think of Fazio as basically a more intelligent Dawson - where his lack of pace is made up for in his reading of the game and intelligence. I also think (correct me if I'm wrong) Fazio has played as DMC destroyer at times - so also has a decent touch and pass on him too. 

*On 7 May 2008, Fazio scored his first goal for Sevilla in a 3–0 win at Racing de Santander.[3] He added another in that match, and a third a week later in a 2–0 home success against Real Betis; in both games, he played as a defensive midfielder.[4]* so 3 goals in a week playing as a DMC. Not bad. 

Plus, he captained Sevilla to the EL win, something we're looking to win ourselves this year and just has much more presence than even Dawson does. 6'4 (1.95m), 14 stone (90k) compared to 12 stone 4 (79kg) and 6'2 or (1.88m).

true,Zetavu,null,null,"First off, the whole timeline thing with the Doctor's age got screwed up decades ago. According to episode statements, Troughton was around 500 years old, Tom Baker was 750, and Colin Baker documented it at 953. 

Then you get all the years with numbers 7 through the end of the War Doctor (remember, he starts young and then ages during the war). Not sure if they ever mentioned how long the war lasted.

Unfortunately, for the reboot they  reset the Doctor at 900, he should have been more like 1200-1400. Then in Impossible Astronaut we see a 900 year old and 1100 year old Doctor. All continuity shot.

However, I would throw a different theory out there. The longer he has a body, the younger he regenerates (or bigger age difference). #1 Hartnell we assume had his body for say 450 years (traveled for half of them). He goes to number 2 Troughton and we see a dramatic transformation to a much younger man. His regeneration is forced on him by the Time Lords so #3 Pertwee is as old if not older. He regenerates after a relatively short time (stuck on earth, so unless he runs off on his own without companions, short time) and regenerates to a moderately younger person (#4 Tom Baker). He is around for the longest time, multiple companions including another Time Lord. In fact his future self is already waiting for his regeneration, so in comes #5 Davidson, youngest doctor to that point (and second youngest yet)

He is around a reasonable time and regenerates to a reasonable similar person (older but not much difference, #6 Colin). He has a very short tenure and becomes #7 McCoy, who is similar to older again. He gets a long time (you see him age because of the time gap when the first show is cancelled) and goes #8, McGann, much younger. 

#8 only had the tv movie but we assume he had a very long tenure from the stories and his small snippet when he regenerated to the war doctor John Hurt, again, a young man at first. He has a very long war, and at the end mercifully regenerates to a young #9. We have no idea how long he lasted, how long he traveled before Rose, but he also becomes a young #10 Tennant. He also has long periods of travel, so we assume gets much older, and then we get #11, Smith who was the youngest yet.

Smith on paper has the longest tenure, 200 years traveling on his own, then 900 years on Christmas, but he also is the last of the regenerations, and realistically much older than any other doctor (for tenure). He becomes #12, and thought he looks old and follows the longest Doctor, is actually young compared to 1100 years of Smith.

So there, we have very very little to work with, and since they've already long since botched continuity, its hard to argue either way.",0,1409170233,null,0,false,0,ck25os6,t3_2epskw,t1_ck25os6,t1_ck1sisz,null,1427330037,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

Okay, let's look at your claims:

&gt; Practically every chapter of The Quran contains violent fantasies about how non-believers are going to be tortured in hell-fire.

This is a colossal, incredible exaggeration. Hardly any of the book even covers this topic.

&gt; I'm all too aware that apostates and atheists can actually be killed in several Islamic states.

And there have been plenty of atheist states which have imprisoned, tortured and killed believers including muslims. Do you hate atheism as a result?

&gt; There's a hadith which says that hell is full of nagging women.

And there are plenty of others which say they should be protected, cherished and provided for, indeed that men have a religious duty to do so.

&gt; I also think that Islam, like other religions before it, has the potential to be extraordinarily dangerous.

Every religious persuasion, including atheism, has produced terrible crimes at one time or another.

true,backtowriting,null,null,"&gt;This is a colossal, incredible exaggeration. Hardly any of the book even covers this topic.

I urge people to read an English translation of the Quran online and decide for themselves.  [Here's one for example.](http://www.clearquran.com)

But let's say your claim is right.  What would it matter if there were only a few chapters which talk about the non-believers being tortured in hellfire?

&gt;And there have been plenty of atheist states which have imprisoned, tortured and killed believers including muslims. Do you hate atheism as a result?

No communist state killed people because of atheism.  Atheism is not even an ideology.  It's an absence of a belief in a supernatural God.  

&gt;And there are plenty of others which say they should be protected, cherished and provided for, indeed that men have a religious duty to do so.

Does it really matter if you can find some good verses when there are so many bad ones?  Does it matter if there are some paragraphs in a book about fluffy bunnies if there are other paragraphs calling for people to be stoned?

&gt;They're [your claims] selective at best and outright dishonest at worst.

Fair enough.  So I urge everyone to see just how dishonest I am by reading the Quran.  Oh boy am I going to have egg on my face when you find out that the Quran is a book full of stories about how we should be nice to each-other and respect each other's beliefs.

It sounds like there's some line for you involving whether they are useful to you or not (alive).  Is that correct?  Is usefulness to you (for some non-dead purpose) the key for you?

For me, the ethics involves a combination of how well will eating some individual (animal, vegetable, mineral or whatever) will further my long term goals as given to me by evolution (to be a creative explorer of the universe), added to whether or not something tastes good, added to whether or not eating that individual is going to be seriously harmed by my action.  (If I can eat just part of a plant, and still let it grow, or if I can plant it's seeds to help it grow babies, then it's ideal, but I'm willing to compromise.)

So, your interpretation of millions of others.

&gt; so in europe was peaceful world there were no waring states?

Indeed, and colonialism was in full strife. Pondicherry? Goa?

&gt; annexed with divide and rule policy,

Divided that which was not united, interesting. In fact, certain rulers were enthusiastic of British intervention against long-term enemies.

&gt; Creating railways to transfer goods so that British east India company can loot lot more easily is not good neither did the boards that put on railways ""Indian and dogs are not allowed"" helped any Indians, Probably in britain they dont teach these thing but its true only certain coaches Indians are allowed to travel earlier days

How, without transferring the entire population of Britain, did they service a vastly superior population? Introducing tea from China was a bad thing that employed hundreds of thousands of otherwise indentured agricultural workers? Looting what, exactly?

&gt; If UK gained nothing why on earth more Indians soldiers are dead in WWs than those of britain soldiers. What about millions of people who are dead due artificial famines in India during raj so UK can support its war against its neighbors.

Two points:

1) Were the soldiers forced to fight? No.

2) Artificial famines? This is a skewed misconception due the the fact the British authorities actually bothered to record the famines, rather than previous rules who just accepted the mass deaths as part of fate or 'punishments from G(g)od/s'.

true,Milvusmilvus,null,null,"It'll be easy to find a place, but it will depend on how cheap you can find a flat as to whether you can afford it. For example, I just moved to Newport (near Cardiff) and am paying £475 a month for a 2 bedroom flat. The deposit was £575 and there was an admin fee of £140 for referencing, with a fee of £50 per additional occupant (but I live alone). So that would be £1240 to start with. Then you have to pay for electric and gas (mine is about £50 a month combined), water (£25 a month), council tax (mine is band B, the second cheapest and is £65 a month but would be £86 with 2 people). So now you are looking at nearly £1400 already, and you wouldn't have a phone line or internet connection. 

However, for a studio you'd probably only be paying £350 a month rent, but even paying a bit more you should have plenty for food and stuff. 

You can search for flats through zoopla and rightmove, I haven't used spareroom. If it doesn't involve a letting agent but just connects you with a landlord it would save you the ""admin fee"" however, which could be good. I rent through Peter Alan and while they are not always very quick to respond to me they have been decent enough, they have a Cardiff office.

This is untrue of course; atheists running atheist states practising [state atheism](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_atheism) have invariably targeted believers for specific discrimination, persecution and brutality.

For a hard-earned 100k portfolio you'd be paying a whopping £450 in fees, plus £11.95 per trade. So let's say you only do 8 trades per year (2 per quarter), that'd be a wallet-blistering £545.60.

With a cheaper fixed-free broker like iWeb or Interactive Investors, you'd be looking at ~£80 p/a for the exact equivalent service.

Even with a small portfolio of say £10k, you'd *still* be worse off: 0.45% of 10k + 8 trades @ £11.95 = £140.60.

All in all, they seem exceedingly expensive, and I can't understand any situation where Hargreaves Lansdown would be better than one of the alternatives.

I think it's also worth considering that it generally costs a fair bit of money to escape from one broker and go to another, so it's my view that you should consider what your portfolio could plausibly be worth, and not just jump for a % fee broker because your pot is small now - in the future it might come back to bite you.

true,Jackisback123,null,null,"&gt; That might be a plausible reason, but do you have any evidence it's actually true? It doesn't seem to be the case in the linked article.

Alas not. I heard this from an experienced firearms officer, but I suppose you don't have any reason to trust him, or to trust that he actually said that.

&gt; It's worrying because we perceive that it's unnecessary. We could be wrong, but it doesn't seem that anything has actually changed to make it suddenly worthwhile.

It's largely common sense. Picture this scenario:

   &gt; *An armed response vehicle is called out to reports of an armed robbery, with the officers' firearms locked away in the vehicle's safe.*

  &gt; *The officers either have to arrive at the location and unlock the safe, retrieve their firearms and hope that the armed robbers don't open fire, or unlock the safe and gear up when they get the call, wasting valuable time before they can set off.*

   &gt; *However, if they already have their sidearms in their holsters, they can set off immediately and, as soon as they arrive, challenge the suspects.*

I do understand that the above scenario is slightly different, in that the officers are in their vehicles. However, the same principle can be applied to firearms officers who patrol on foot. Would you rather that firearms officers were only able to carry their sidearms if they were in their vehicle or actively responding to an incident? By doing so, it means that those officers are less useful, as they cannot help out with routine incidents. 

Of course, you might say they could attend those routine incidents if they left their sidearm in the car, but this means, if they come across an incident requiring a firearms response on foot patrol, they cannot interveine. It also means that, if a firearms incident is called in, they would have to run to their car to retrieve their sidearm, even if the incident is two streets away and their car is parked half-a-mile away.

&gt; One concern is that armed police will only start an arms race as it becomes important for criminals to keep up.

The up-arming argument is a load of nonsense. Criminals know that, except for very rare exceptions to this rule, the police won't shoot unless there is actually a threat.

Why would criminals start carrying guns when it will only serve to increase the allowed use of force and up their prison sentence when they are invariably caught?

Did criminals everywhere start carrying batons, CS gas and wearing stab vests when they were issued to officers? No.",0,1409173188,null,0,false,0,ck27c0j,t3_2eq9kn,t1_ck27c0j,t1_ck26jbg,null,1427329271,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,doonjoot,null,null,"&gt;Now do an overlap with socioeconomic status and then you can start making accurate arguments instead of ""Well, X% of crimes Y is committed by Asians, therefore Asians are more likely to be criminals""

Well, very roughly, in about five minutes, with the first source I found on google:

[link](http://www.poverty.org.uk/06/index.shtml) ""almost half of all children from ethnic minorities live in low-income households compared to a quarter of White British children. ""

Now that source lumps together black caribeans and inidians, but seperates out africans, with different percentages in poverty for both. This complicates things for our puposes, because the met figures on which the ninety two percent claim are based used the catch all term ""black"" (I believe).
Still, we can probably use a figure of double the poverty levels for blacks as compared to whites.

Now, black people account for 13 percent of the [population of london](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_London). If gang rapes were evenly distributed among racial groups, Black people would be responsible for thirteen percent of gang rapes.

Leaving aside the classism (funny old thing, prejudice), if we accept the inference that poverty leads someone to be more likely to commit a gang rape, Then we can do some simple maths.

So, according to my first source, fifity percent of blacks live in poverty. Thats a pool of potential poor person gang rapists of roughly 540,000 in London.

Twenty five percent of whites live in poverty. I really can't be bothered breaking it down accross every ethnic group, so lets just use twenty five perecent as the number in poverty for all non blacks. The potential pool of poor person non balck gang rapists is roughly 2,750,000. Fucking hell there's lot of poor folks in London.

So, black people are roughly 20 percent of the poor person population, which means they should (assuming poverty is contributory factor to gang rape) be reponsible for twenty percent of gang rapes. And yet, they are actually responsible for 92 percent.

I think it may well be much, much more complicated than that.

&gt; “grants are awarded on the basis of open competition and decided through peer review by appropriate expert researchers on a project-specific basis. They are thus not allocated on the basis of location, either geographic or political”.

Scotland has a lot of Scientific institutions. probably more than Wales and Northern Ireland. It would thus take up a bit more of the U.K. budget. [The current U.K. budget per year stands at 5.5Bn with little added contracts to private firms every now and then](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/278326/bis-14-p200-science-and-research-budget-allocations-for-2015-to-2016.pdf) Would be able to see the Scottish government match this level of funding? I personally think in terms of scientific research Scotland would be slightly better off IN the U.k but in the event of a YES vote can we expect to see scientific research agreements? It would be fascinating to see whether the U.K. and Scotland could dump more money into one reserach body for the rU.K, iScotland and maybe Ireland.

What we know- 
Missy is the GateKeeper of the Nethersphere. 
Missy's welcomed a guy who died in that episode to ""Heaven"" and ""Paradise"".
Missy called the Doctor her boyfriend. 
Missy's in the season finale with Cybermen and tombstones.
I don't think she's the Master, or the Rani. I feel like there would be a different feel to her, a more- well, Timelordy-ness to it.
Then again, she was only on screen for 5 minutes. 
She might be Clara, and originally I thought she might be River Song, but now I don't think so.
My theory is that the Nethersphere is somekind of alternate reality or higher plane of existence, or maybe something like E-Space. When someone from the first world dies, they go to the Nethersphere.
I think Missy, being the Gatekeeper, is associated with death, and, the Doctor being utterly surrounded by death, makes her believe he's her ""Boyfriend"". 
Now, here's what we have: Cybermen, Thantos (Missy), and graveyards. That leads me to think during the season finale, the Cybermen will figure out how to resurrect humans, which explains why Missy's evolved. This would be a good story, because the Doctor has many dead friends, alternate versions of Clara have died, and spirits are going missing from the Missy's realm.

true,ProtoKun7,smith,Smith,"Post-series 2 information inbound (I could use spoiler tags but that can be annoying in larger pieces of writing):

Actually, there was a biological metacrisis in series 4; the Doctor was hit by a glancing blow from a Dalek, which caused him to begin regenerating. He used some of the regeneration energy to heal his body, however to stop the change, he forced the excess energy afterwards into the hand that was cut off on Christmas Day. That meant that the Eleventh Doctor had no more regenerations left. He was granted a new cycle, and the Twelfth Doctor came from the first regeneration in the new cycle.

The Twelfth Doctor is the thirteenth body, though, yes (but some people think he's the fourteenth due to confusion about the nature of the metacrisis. That regeneration didn't actually change the Doctor's body, so he was the same before and after).",0,1409174410,null,0,1409174772,0,ck27z2v,t3_2er00r,t1_ck27z2v,t1_ck27r75,null,1427328920,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1
true,_tpyo,dorset,Dorset,"Neither. 

Its the word you use when people aren't actually arguing points or scrutinising things from an objective perspective but just pointing as Islam like its a bloke that you can blame.    
""Islamaphobes"" don't want to do the hard work like learning politics,  cultural differences and having a perspective of history to explain the complicated things in the world.  
Its not an idealistic child who had a hard time growing up learnt their ""less than just"" origins and was then further influenced by a militant. No, no, no, no. The reasoning behind whatever attack is because Islam is a violent religion.  

Instead they seek a simple solution, a simple way of identifying ""wrong"" without all that necessity for thinking.... and thus they woefully attribute behaviour, attitudes and philosophies with one stroke of a brush across millions of individuals all over the world with different nationalities, class, upbringing, values, desires, fears and ignorances.  
This is what Islamaphobia is and it creates fear at a level of the worst extremist and applies it to the most innocent.

------

Lets not beat around the bush, all religions fucking suck, even Buddhism has been used to do all sorts of rank shit so ergo: Islam sucks.  
However ""Islamaphobes"" want to turn it into a pissing content:  

&gt; OH BUT ISLAM SUCKS MORE  

When you enter such a pissing contest, that's when you realise its someone that has taken Islam == Bad as opposed to actually reading up on the histories of the other respective religions.  

... and no, I have no interest in the pissing contest if anyone was interested. Lets ask who you'd rather take on a date: Stalin or Hitler? Which is worse? Play fuck, kill, marry with Mao, Paul Pot and Idi Amin perhaps? Lets spend out time working out which total fuckhead was totally the _worst_ total fuckhead because I'm sure that's really going to prove a lot.

John Lennon's killer was inspired by Catcher in the Rye.  Does that mean that J. D. Salinger was morally culpable?  No it does not, because his book does not advocate violence in any way, shape or form.

Mein Kampf helped inspire Nazism.  And its author *was* morally responsible, because he intended it to stir up antisemitic hatred.

The Communist Manifesto is an interesting case.  Arguably, Marx wasn't advocating extreme violence, and yet Communism has led to the deaths of millions.  Do we hold Communism responsible?  I think so, yes, because it is an ideology which in practice often leads to bloodshed.  

But with atheism, there's no ideology to be held responsible.  The only way I think atheism could be faulted is if it could be shown that people will resort to violence without a belief in God.  But we know this just isn't true. If anything, atheists in secular societies are more peaceful and law abiding than the rest of the population.

Atheism doesn't promote violence and neither does it create the conditions for violence to occur.

We know how and why people jump red lights, and why they do so in an entirely different pattern of behaviour from motorists. We know who will ride on pavements and when, just from looking at the road layout. We can tell you where cyclists are going to get killed (and which demographic) from the plans, before a single lorry has turned up to start the work.

It's all so tedious and predictable but nobody listens and we get tired of this shit. Instead people complain about the avoidance tactics and survival methods that cyclists learn. It's like complaining about colleagues who take an extra day off work to recover from a cold, because they're ""not pulling their weight"" &amp;mdash; it might seem poor, but the alternative is far worse.

It's a sad and sorry state of affairs that cycling on the roads in this country is the domain of the young fit male. Timidity gets you killed on the roads. Many cyclists recognise this and will ride on the pavement. But it's the road cyclists that bear the outrage because no-one likes shouting at old ladies riding at 6mph. So much easier on the conscience to complain about ""lycra louts"", eh?

Well sooner or later we will have it both ways, laugh all you want. Petrol prices don't go down in the long term. Car dealerships seem more desperate these days. I'm going to keep riding, in primary, and encourage all my friends and colleagues to do the same. It'll not be a Dutch-style revolution but I think it will be change anyway.

true,neverendingwantlist,null,null,"[This comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2epkt5/icebucket_challenge_reason_why_you_should_donate/ck1r98g) has a link explaining that they actually spend over half their budget on labour ($12.5m). I suspect some of the 'expenses for non-employee labor' are fundraising drives but the salaries are surprising ($340,000 for the CEO!).

I don't think that should instantly put people off the charity however. Should they get $50m from this campaign instead of last years $24m you would assume that the labour costs couldn't continue taking up the same proportion of income, maybe a small rise in costs but from 50% ($12m) to 30% ($15m) or something similar.

If people are seriously considering donating regularly to the charity then this is the time to find out what their priorities are. If the wages increase, if the lobbying costs shoot up or if they don't dramatically increase spending on research then you would have to seriously question whether it was a charity worth supporting.

Back to /u/anudeglory's point, I do agree that MacMillan's move appears pathetic but from what I can see other charities are not making the same mistake, people are donating to them out of preference. This shouldn't be a big issue as the money is still being donated to good causes that will ultimately help a wider range of people (eg. 1 in 100,000 people in the UK suffer from MND whereas 1 in 10 across the world don't have access to clean drinking water).",0,1409175165,null,0,false,0,ck28d8v,t3_2epkt5,t1_ck28d8v,t1_ck1ztgq,null,1427328736,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

You never know what will happen, so you can't really say ""screw it"" yet.  Last year, the same week as the semis, we were in shambles, with a massive injury list, a new coach, 5th in the league, drew Arsenal in the FA, and still had Europa.  Only Man City and Chelsea would be deep enough to compete for 4th, beat Arsenal, and still have the legs for Europa.

THERE IS ONE KIND OF TEA PREDOMINANTLY DRUNK IN THE UK AND IRELAND, AND IT IS ""BLACK TEA"". THE MAIN BRANDS PURCHASED ARE TETLEYS, PG TIPS, ETC.

The original article is discussing tea in the UK, and I've qualified all my statements/ points to be purely UK/ Ireland focused, and expressed an opinion that I can't get a proper cup of tea in the US the way it is back home, so WTF are you talking about stores in America for?

You're not from the UK/ Ireland are you? If you were, you wouldn't be fighting me on this and worried about being wrong. It's ok to be wrong, it's called a ""learning experience"". That is what happens when you don't have a massive ego attached to being ""right"", and are actually open to input. You know, like input from people who grew up in a place sharing information about the habits of people who .. grew  up in that place, like I'm sharing with you, and which you're trying to somehow ignore, so you can ""be right"".

Suggestion, stop being a fucking child and throwing temper tantrums, it won't serve you well in life, trust me.

Here you go, this should illustrate how none of your comments about ""orange hokey pokey"" or references to speciality tea shops has ANYTHING to do with how tea is presented, purchased and drunk in the UK/ Ireland...

I genuinely laughed. A few people on here know I've been cycling for well over a decade. I guess you were unaware. Either way you grossly underestimate my knowledge on the subject. 

We're actually in agreement to an extent - we *do* need better infrastructure to accommodate cyclists, keep them safe and allow them to move around as suits them best. It needs to be thought out in conjunction with pedestrians and motorists and how *they* move around - but other countries manage it. I'm not saying it can't be done. 

What I don't agree with is this: 

&gt; We know how and why people jump red lights, and why they do so in an entirely different pattern of behaviour from motorists. We know who will ride on pavements and when, just from looking at the road layout. 

You mention these things almost in passing - as though they don't matter. So I'll ask bluntly: 

Do pedestrians not matter? Does their safety come below cyclists? Is that how it has to be? 

Because when you defend cyclists jumping red lights and using pavements - that's how it sounds. Here we have an article about a number of guide dogs hit by cyclists and how they break road laws (in the name of their own safety - according to you). 

Does that make it OK? Does that make them particularly safe? Should we shrug our shoulders and say 'well that's OK then, please carry on risking the safety of guide dogs / pedestrians / anyone else who happens to get in the way of the manoeuvres you want to pull'.

But yes; it's best to focus on your exam results rather than extra curricular stuff. Excellent exam results will make up for weaker EC stuff but it's not true for the opposite. They don't presume that you have a solid background in Computer Science - particularly considering that a significant proportion of applicants haven't even taken it as a formal subject at school - so it won't be particularly advantageous in the interview. Exam results should be the main determinant in whether you get an offer or not - though that isn't to say that relevant EC won't boost your application and show ""passion"".

They provide statistics that will help you determine how you compare against the typical applicant, so you can make a tactical decision about whether you want to actually sit the TSA: different colleges have different methods of interviewing candidates and a minority of colleges will make you sit the TSA. I did AS-level Critical Thinking, which is practically half of the TSA, so I was at a good advantage.

true,ccrobin,null,null,"&gt; It's largely common sense. Picture this scenario:

Oh come on, it's possible to contrive a scenario that makes literally anything seem like a good idea - honestly, that really isn't a very good argument.

&gt;  if they come across an incident requiring a firearms response on foot patrol, they cannot interveine. It also means that, if a firearms incident is called in, they would have to run to their car to retrieve their sidearm, even if the incident is two streets away and their car is parked half-a-mile away

This is the same thing again. It's obviously possible to *imagine* a scenario where this is important - but what really matters is what happens and is important in real life.

Now, maybe you feel that there are literally no downsides, or that they are overwhelmed by the convenience in the situations you outline. The problem there is that this is only debatable because people disagree with that. If you actually want to debate anything, you have to address these points, not make up scenarios/statistics and declare that in your imagination the answer is obvious.

&gt; The up-arming argument is a load of nonsense. Criminals know that, except for very rare exceptions to this rule, the police won't shoot unless there is actually a threat.

Again you declare that something is obvious, but I (and lots of other people) won't accept that without actual evidence. If you can provide some, that would be different.

&gt; Why would criminals start carrying guns when it will only serve to increase the allowed use of force and up their prison sentence when they are invariably caught?

Because people aren't logical automatons planning for the long term interests of everyone. Especially, perhaps, in the case of criminals.

&gt; Did criminals everywhere start carrying batons, CS gas and wearing stab vests when they were issued to officers? No.

This one's just a strawman - the argument isn't that criminals will always attempt to precisely duplicate the police loadout.

Batons are a simple blunt instrument, and people can and do commit crimes with knives - the probably more dangerous alternative. Gas is probably hard to get hold of, and probably not that useful for a criminal to plan for having anyway. The same for stab vests, in the context of interacting with the police criminals aren't concerned about being stabbed - the police use, as you say, batons.

------

Overall, your entire post is nothing but baseless assertions with a couple of different fallacies thrown in for variety. Perhaps you think the issue really is so obvious that no argument is necessary, but it won't help you if you think it's all you need to convince others.

true,[deleted],null,null,"This sort of bullshit bollocks is what fucking infuriates me about society in general, and I don't mean those who are deemed 'elitist' either, I'm talking about the people who fucking play up to this shit.

If I'm driving down the motorway doing 80 odd, and some wealthy guy in a fucking gorgeous car comes up behind me and gets on my arse, I give way without getting pissed off. I am driving a shitter car, so how can I rage? I'd even move over for somebody in a mini metro who wants to blast the fuck out of it in saying that. But a lot of people would think 'prick' as he overtakes you, due to his car and the fact he's enjoying it and using it for how it is supposed to be used. 

In work, if I meet an incredibly influential and wealthy person and am doing the typical 'scouse thing', that seems to get me by and the respect of my peers by saying something witty about the situation and he comes back with an incredly non-witty but factually accurate view of the situation I'll think 'I need that level of professionalism to get more money'. 

If I'm in tesco and the girl on the register looks depressed as fuck I'd think 'she hates life', and possibly make a comment about how I need my vitamin D from oranges, just to see what she says as I understand where she is now and how a positive outlook, combined with a dedicated work ethic can get you where you want to be. I compare myself in that situation and know I'd say something like 'yeah in this weather mate ya not gonna get a lot from the sun harhar', or something slightly banterish. 

When I'm out in a local pub on a friday night and it's fucking heaving and there are guys with their backs against the wall, in a large group who say things like 'ya get me manz dem', and I can see them over the shoulder of the gorgeous girl I'm making slightly smile I'll think 'you need to let yourselves go boys and enjoy yourselves'. 

People are so fucking opinionated about stupid shit and it hinders them in life. A guy with a huge property portfolio and many successful businesses sitting in his London office, who is taking and making calls constantly and emailing people, organising where he needs to be when for maximum efficiency of his presence is not an 'elite' guy, he's still just a guy who's going to bed at night to sleep like the rest of us do and waking up again tomorrow to a new day. 

And furthermore, if our society was more based on 'equality', or whatever fucking buzz word somebody wants to use with no logic behind it, only an ideology.. I would still be talking to that girl in a bar who is smiling looking at the gang of muppets thinking 'live your fucking lives instead of going home to snort beak until this morning comes on'.. and he would still be jealous of me later that night putting it in her arse as she says 'I've never done it like this before', as she finds something new in her life she likes. And that's the fucking point.. people will be jealous of other people ALL THE FUCKING TIME. Some people are just born better looking, so get more pussy. Uglier people are going to be jealous of that and like myself have to develop humor and a brain to get by at any decent standard of living. The more we restrict people doing what they want or 'equalise', shit gets fucked up. 

People who are opinionated based on an ideology leads to things like ISIS occuring, that is the real thing we need to distance ourselves from in this country, rather than thinking 'we're deeply elitist', we have far greater problems than that.

I would say there will at the very least be a need for **all** parties to reinvent themselves as the they will be approaching a new political landscape. Personally I would prefer to see the disbandment of Scottish Labour, Lib Dems, Tories etc. as well as SNP. Basically any party that has an English counterpart. Because it would be better to take a fresh approach without the constraints that the traditions of those parties would have. New Scottish parties for new Scottish politics.

SNP would arguably have to remain around for at least a few years, as ""proof of concept"". It could be seen as irresponsible to disband before they ensure stability for Scotland first, which I fully expect them to do. The SNP are an unusual party in that they are the only one currently driven by a larger vision. Obviously that vision will be reality if we are independent, so it's inevitable they disband eventually. But the passion most of it's backers have for Scotland and it's politics will not disappear. So they will be driven to join &amp; create the new parties more than most I would say. Be that left or right parties.

That said, I could see the Greens enjoying a boost since they are likely to have a proportionally bigger influence on environmental issues in Indy Scotland. Which is just good news for everyone I think, even though they would only be my personal 2nd vote. Scotland does tend to have a more environmentally concerned attitude than the UK government and it would be good see that reflected in our own.

I could see a new Leftist party scooping most votes. Likely one with the attitudes more like that of the early Labour party, when it was driven by working-class issues. Some would claim one of the Socialist parties could manage this. I'm not sure, since they are prone to passionate but somewhat volatile people (I'm looking at you, Tommy Sheridan). But it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world, since Scotland's attitude does feel more Socialist than the UK.

A ""right of centre"" party will definitely always exist in some form, although I seriously doubt it would be wise to continue the Scottish Conservatives. And whoever they are, they are likely to be in the minority. At least until Scotland fosters enough rich right-wing elites to give them any weight.

&gt;Three months after the events of the warehouse, Amy is chased down the Valley of Gods in Utah. She has strange pen markings all over her skin and arms. She is cornered between two SUVs and a cliff-face. Canton Delaware advises her to surrender. When she wonders if he remembers what happened at the warehouse, he responds by shooting her down. 
&gt;In Area 51, the Eleventh Doctor, is held prisoner in a straight jacket and under heavy security. Canton tosses a file of pictures taken of the markings on Amy to the Doctor, questioning him about their meaning. The Doctor suggests Canton ask Amy himself, getting no response, implying her death.
&gt;River Song, also covered in markings, explores an unfinished skyscraper in New York City filled with the mysterious aliens. FBI agents corner her at the edge of the building. Again, Canton advises her to surrender, but she warns them of the alien occupation and smiles sadly before falling off the side of the building.

orange pekoe is black tea.

orange pekoe, one of tetley's most popular blends of black tea denotes a certain preparation of the leaf.

other tea grading includes fannings, dust, broken leaf and flowery.

there are a variety of orange pekoe gradings denoting black tea quality.

unless stated otherwise (such as earl grey) if you're drinking tetley, you're drinking orange pekoe. It may also be a blend of both orange pekoe and pekoe grade *black tea*.

&gt;nd expressed an opinion that I can't get a proper cup of tea in the US the way it is back home, so WTF are you talking about stores in America for?

because your opinion is clearly incorrect.

&gt;Here you go, this should illustrate how none of your comments about ""orange hokey pokey"" or references to speciality tea shops has ANYTHING to do with how tea is presented, purchased and drunk in the UK/ Ireland...

you want to find your smallbatch dingleberryshire tea you go to a tea shop not wegman's. 

it's not difficult.

He had stabbed himself in a drug-induced psychotic episode. The knife went into his heart. He was air-lifted to Bristol for emergency surgery (and weirdly enough I met him in clinic months later).

Anyway, that's by the by. Whilst marijuana is prevalent at Notting Hill, it's fuelled by booze. Glasto is fuelled by drugs and in my mind that is a key reason there is more violence at Notting Hill. Secondly, a lot of violent types including gang members are attracted to Notting Hill. Finally, glasto has a £200 entry fee.

You acknowledge that criminals are using knives, which can be fatal. Short range weapons, such as batons and CS spray are largely ineffective at dealing with knives, unless police officers are willing to risk serious injury by putting yourself in range of the knife to use their baton or spray. [Case in point here](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8523151/Police-tackle-machete-wielding-man-with-wheelie-bin.html) and [here.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2063552/Kingsbury-stabbing-4-police-officers-injured-man-goes-berserk-butchers-knife.html)

Are the above not real world cases for providing officers with firearms?

You suggest that criminals are going to consciously arm themselves with firearms if police routinely carry them. Can you explain the thought  process behind this, because I can only come up with the below, which doesn't seem to make much sense. 

&gt; Criminal: Oh, look. Plod have started routinely carrying sidearms, so I'm going to buy one for myself to.... well, I'll shoot a cop to get away from an invariable police caution after I'm caught shoplifting cheese for the millionth time, and then everything will be fine and dandy and I'll ride off into the sunset, the police won't shoot me and I won't go to jail for the rest of my life instead of just signing a piece of paper.

Criminals who want firearms will already have them - they aren't going to suddenly throw fits because police officers have guns and they don't.

The only issue I can see with 'why always cyclists removed from the equation, why not motorists' is that our road infrastructure is: engrained, universally adopted, convenient, allows for multiple forms of transport (car, bus, HGV etc.) as well as heavy goods transport... 

So phasing out motor vehicles is going to be a drawn out process - it's not going to happen quickly at all. That doesn't mean I'm not in favour of planning for the future... 

Meanwhile - hate to say it - I really have nearly been hit by 4 cyclists jumping red lights this year and I do mean *very* close calls. As much as I do ride and love riding - I also can't muster much consideration for people who allow that situation to come up at all.

true,shortpaleugly,null,null,"&gt; Bhaji, with all respect, it's important to note that most Sikhs, especially in the West, are generally more educated and socially less backwards than Punjabi (especially Mirpuri) Muslims. It's been that way historically since the Sikh Raj,

Because we've made efforts to integrate into the societies and alongside the cultures we've emigrated into.

They've just ghettoised themselves because of the inherent dichotomy that exists where non-Muslims aren't seen as worthy of equal treatment by them as would their fellow Muslims.

That's why they've targeted non-Muslim girls in their **thousands**.

&gt;The Pakistani Muslims in America are truly wonderful people, and the Canadian Sikh gangs/druggies/murderers are trash on the street; it's very hard to stereotype Pakistanis or Muslim community as a whole.

Wonderful people in what way? I haven't said that Pakistani Muslims are **all** evil or bad people. And how do you measure just how wonderful they are anyhow?

Besides, if you're telling me that Sikhs in Canada are trash then I can just tell you that in the UK there is a big problem with Pakistani gangs, drug addiction and dealing, terrorism, female oppression, poverty, lack of educational attainment, high unemployment, Islamic fundamentalism, high infant mortality as a result of first-cousin marriage and so on and so forth.

Neither the above nor anything about the criminal proclivities of Canadian Sikhs makes it any less true that Muslim Pakistanis in Britain are disproportionately likely to be convicted of sexual offences against children than their share of the British population should warrant.

&gt;But this should not be a time for us Sikhs to say ""ha! Look at the fucked up pakis and us enlightened Sikhs,"" when our own community is messed up in so many ways.

No one is: what we're all saying is that it's wrong to back down from challenging the Muslim Pakistani community's links to child abuse for fear of being deemed a racist or an Islamophobe.

Making the link that it has to do with religion is quite disingenuous. Almost none of the other Muslim groups in Britain participate in this, and I've even heard many condemn it and hate Pakistanis for giving a bad image to all Muslims (including some Punjabi Pakistanis in Britain who blame Mirpuris [the most backwards Pakistani group] for giving the wrong message for all Pakistanis.

To give you another example that may touch a cord as a Sikh, Punjabi Sikhs are overall more well educated, socially liberal, and in line with their country's customs than Punjabi Muslims. They aren't as bad as Muslims, but they have their own problems; being the biggest smugglers of drugs in Canada, forming gangs in which people get killed, the occasional honor killing, rape victim shaming, domestic abuse, etc.. Punjabi Hindus are overall more well educated and wealthier than Sikhs; these problems don't exist in their diaspora communities, and most of the top Punjabi professionals (like the dean of Harvard college, Rakesh Khurana, and the Nobel prize winner, Hargobind Khurana) are Hindu. 

There is an argument I've seen some Hindus make that Sikhs suffer the problems that Hindus don't because ""of Khalistani nationalism""; that is to say, the Sikh community's longing for a separate identity and sovereignty from Hinduism/India creates a ""we are da best"" mentality that leads to our downfall. Hindus don't suffer a similar problem, so it makes sense, right?

Not quite. If we look at Punjabi Hindu demographics, pretty much every single one in the diaspora is from a wealthy urban background in Punjab. That's just how things are. If we look at the makeup of Punjabi Sikh diaspora, we will find the majority (and pretty much everyone who participates in ""Sikh problems"") to be of a rural Jatt background; meaning they are farmers who till their own land. This is why they are more conservative and overall less educated. If we look at the overall demographics of Punjabi Muslims, most come from rural areas in the poorer regions of Punjab; not to mention most don't even till their own land. That is why a ton of the problems are concentrated in that demographic, problems that exceed Sikhs and Hindus'.

This divide has been historical; at the time of Partition, Hindus were wealthy urban dwellers, Sikhs were well-off landowners, and Muslims were the poorer workers on the land. In the diaspora, if you look at Sikh and Muslim from prestigious urban backgrounds, you find tons of professionals competing with Punjabi Hindus. 

And all this is ignoring that Mirpuris are even more backwards http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Mirpuri_community#Health_and_social_issues

The real answer why they target non Muslims? They're horny assholes from fucked up families that don't target members of their community because of the close knit community bond Islam gives that isolates non-Muslims. Also in part probably because Muslim women are harder to access given how much they are restricted in conservative homes.

&gt;Because we've made efforts to integrate into the societies and alongside the cultures we've emigrated into.

&gt;They've just ghettoised themselves because of the inherent dichotomy that exists where non-Muslims aren't seen as worthy of equal treatment by them as would their fellow Muslims.

Actually, Sikhs are quite guilty themselves of ghettoization. See Brampton and Vancouver. American and British Sikhs are better, I suppose. 

Anyway, read my other comment as for why Pakistanis are overall more backwards.

&gt;Wonderful people in what way? I haven't said that Pakistani Muslims are **all** evil or bad people. And how do you measure just how wonderful they are anyhow?

Nice, well educated, liberal modern, etc, etc.. They are all professionals in some way, be it IT or medicine. They are much better to interact with than most of the Jatt Sikhs in Canada.

&gt;Besides, if you're telling me that Sikhs in Canada are trash then I can just tell you that in the UK there is a big problem with Pakistani gangs, drug addiction and dealing, terrorism, female oppression, poverty, lack of educational attainment, high unemployment, Islamic fundamentalism, high infant mortality as a result of first-cousin marriage and so on and so forth.

I know this quite well. And I've addressed that their problems are worse than the Sikh community's. But let's take an honest look here. If I was an outsider, I look at Eastern Punjab's drug rate. I look at Sikhs in Canada. I could easily make a conclusion that Sikhism leads to more drug abuse the same way you've made your conclusion about Islam.

&gt;Neither the above nor anything about the criminal proclivities of Canadian Sikhs makes it any less true that Muslim Pakistanis in Britain are disproportionately likely to be convicted of sexual offences against children than their share of the British population should warrant.

Agreed. I'm not trying to make it less true, I'm arguing the reasoning behind your logic. 

&gt;No one is: what we're all saying is that it's wrong to back down from challenging the Muslim Pakistani community's links to child abuse for fear of being deemed a racist or an Islamophobe.

Absolutely agree. There should be no fear, that's one thing where I'm happier to be American than British; the British seem to fear such communities and allow them to grow stronger rather than directly address it (like Americans have done). 

I would say Muslim Pakistani Brit community; again, here in the States, Muslims and Pakistanis don't pull this kind of shit (mainly because stricter immigration laws). And they're well educated.

Scotland is a country, not a region of the UK. It cannot and has not flourished under Westminster rule. Despite criticism and opposition, devolution has done wonders for our country to show the rest of the UK how we choose to run things differently, within budget, when given the opportunity.

Our democracy is fairer (proportional representation, no benches, no unelected house of lords). Our policies and parties are left leaning which match the views of the electorate.

If anything, other than 8.5; the Doctor who was not called the Doctor, they've been getting younger -- but they threw that out the window with 12. I was looking foreward to a love-struck 20 something Doctor who was into the babes. But I suppose the writers are getting older and want someone to relate to rather than making GOBS OF MONEY. Very foolish IMHO.

And as far as the ""if they got old the regen is young -- but something different happened"" --- well, that's true of all the regenerations. I remember with ""The Master"" during Tom Baker's tenure, that they said he ""Went mad after regenerating 10 times"" -- he broke the rules because he was alive too long.

In this instance the details which set this apart from a modern copy aren't discernible from a picture, and become clear only under magnification.

Most original prints of this kind from this era are dot printed, the kind of print one associates with traditional comic books.

&gt;The __Kilmichael Ambush__ ([Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language): *Luíochán Chill Mhichíl*) was an [ambush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambush) near the village of [Kilmichael](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilmichael,_County_Cork) in [County Cork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Cork) on 28 November 1920 carried out by the [Irish Republican Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Republican_Army) (IRA) during the [Irish War of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_War_of_Independence). Thirty-six local IRA volunteers commanded by [Tom Barry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Barry_(soldier\)) killed seventeen members of the [RIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Irish_Constabulary) [Auxiliary Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxiliary_Division).  The Kilmichael ambush was politically as well as militarily significant. It occurred one week after [Bloody Sunday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Sunday_(1920\)), marking a profound escalation in the IRA campaign.

&gt; Anyway, read my other comment as for why Pakistanis are overall more backwards.

So? We're talking about the UK- no one cares about the state of Canadian Sikhs.

Besides, they're not forming numerous organised paedophile rings to abuse underaged children.

&gt;**Nice**, well educated, **liberal modern**, etc, etc.. They are all professionals in some way, be it IT or medicine. **They are much better to interact with than most of the Jatt Sikhs in Canada.**

All you're doing is using personal impressions and spreading them around as if they're fact. I have emboldened the qualitative words you're ascribing to people- these are irrelevant and immeasurable. You're just echoing your personal confirmatory bias.

What's becoming obvious, however, is that you're showing signs of contempt for your co-religionists in another country in an apparent sign of superiority. But hey- as you have said of Muslim Pakistanis in America so too was my impression of your lack of regard for Jatt Sikhs in Canada **entirely subjective**.

See my point?

&gt;I could easily make a conclusion that Sikhism leads to more drug abuse the same way you've made your conclusion about Islam.

Nope.

Well actually you seemingly could because you're making some pretty weird abstractions from what's said but anyway, I'm not blaming Islam for those problems.

I'm saying those problems afflict the Muslim Pakistani community. I have not supported a correlation-causation fallacy because I'm pinning this on the Pakistani community.

&gt;Agreed. I'm not trying to make it less true, I'm arguing the reasoning behind your logic.

A Muslim who has been born and raised in the West, among people of different beliefs, is different to a Muslim born and raised in places like Iran, Iraq etc, among a population that is predominantly Muslim. It is useful to imagine this is a circlejerk of sorts. 

At least in the West a Muslim may be challenged if his specific interpretation of Islam is out of accordance with societal norms. He will adapt. He may once have hated non-believers but over time his experiences and interactions will change his interpretation. He may have seen non-believers as bad people, but 

If he is  never exposed to differing beliefs, or if those beliefs are heavily marginalized as in ""circlejerk"" countries, then extremism will perpetuate and everything becomes an echochamber of hate for non-believers. 

I'm in agreement. It is very important *not* to group all Muslims together, or to judge individuals based on the actions of those that share their race, their gender, their sex, their politics etc. Projecting hate towards a Westernized Muslim may only confirm any reasons he may have for hating non-believers in turn.

If that's so, why are you trying to tell me that 30 years growing up with one kind of tea in one country, then another 13+ years in the US of trying to recreate that myself, and being offered various attempts to recreate over that period and finding none satisfactory ... is bullshit?

Are you aware that many of the same brands are available in the US and across the pond. Have you ever tried to compare Cadburys Milk Chocolate here and in the UK? Take any brand of chocolate and do a taste test, the stuff here sucks.

Fyi - the ONLY place you can get the same version of the same brands available in the UK, is Indian grocery stores. You'll find British/ Irish version of Tetley's, Cadburys, etc. in those stores, but you'll pay a huge premium as they've been imported. Next time you're near one, go buy some chocolate, find the same thing in the US and try them. The US versions suck. Period. I've lots of friends been here years longer than me and all the expats bring back food stuffs from the UK when they travel, many have items shipped as presents, particularly chocolate, tea, etc. 

I've actually got tea bags from back home in my fridge from months ago, I can't make tea like back home with it, it's in the ballpark, but ever so slightly unsatisfying because the milk over here is just *wrong*, and it fucks up the taste. I gave up trying. ALL my friends have tried, ALL say the same thing.

In related news, it's damn hard to get a decent cup of coffee in the UK, because they all like tea. You can get some ok stuff, but the stuff over here is great.

I recommend you stop being an idiot and telling someone with decades of experience that their experience is bullshit. It won't serve you well in life, it's highly disrespectful and you're missing a learning experience. What you're doing is coming at me with a ""fixed mindset"". It wreaks of ego, trying to hang onto an opinion like it's your identity, and is pretty harmful to your development. Here you go ...

true,CaptainPedge,null,null,"&gt;Do they allow girls to try on bras? What about underwear (as long as I put it over whatever underwear I am already wearing)?

No idea about bras, you would have to ask a lady of some kind about that I'd imagine. In terms of lower underwear, generally its not the done thing, but I'm sure a member of staff would be able to advise you.
&gt;What about any Do's and Don'ts at other stores like supermarkets or department stores?

Not really sure what you're on about here. If the store has baskets of some kind, keep your shopping in them, rather than your personal bags until after you have paid. Oh and there is often an attendant at the changing rooms who will count the number of gaments you are trying on and give you a token or something to make sure you return the same number.
&gt;How flexible are clothing stores, department stores, etc with returns?

Depends on the store. If anything the UK is generally better for the customer when it comes to returns than the US.
&gt;How unusual is it to pay with cash for things like clothes? It's becoming quite unusual here to see people pay with cash for anything anymore unless you're over 65 or something. I won't have a credit card, just a debit card when I'm there. But I've always preferred to pay with cash when I can as I am more conscious about the amount I'm spending.

Not unusual at all. Cheques are outdated these days and many shops refuse to accept them, but cash is considered normal.
&gt;Do store workers follow you around a lot when you're browsing? Or does it depend on the size of the shop? I just want to know how often I should expect that as I've always found that to be annoying (on the occasion it happens.)

It depends on the size of the shop and how busy it is. Don't be offended by it though. Think of it as them making sure you know where they are if you need help.
&gt;I come from a state with no tax (vat?) on clothing. But I'm 9 months into a diet that is changing the shape of my body completely. Any recommendations on affordable stores or online stores for clothes? It's kind of becoming quite acceptable and normal to go to thrift stores here in the USA, but my friend told me once that it's ""embarrassing"" to be seen buying clothes in charity shops over there. I'm spending a lot of my money and budget studying there for a year, but I also don't want to look like I'm draped in oversized clothing after a few months. But... I also don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on decent clothing either.

Well remember that in the UK, the price you see is the price you pay, on all goods. Tax is calculated on the business' end rather than the customer's. In terms of where to go, If you are just after basics (plain-ish tshirts, simple underwear or socks, that kind of everyday thing) then there are plenty of places around and even most of the major supermarkets will be able to sort you out. Without knowing a little more about you it's difficult to recommend actual stores to try, but in most major town centres you will be able to find plenty of different stores to cater to your needs. One other thing, our charity shops are a little different to your thrift stores (I believe). They price items in the same way as normal stores and haggling over price is not done. The quality of what's on offer will differ greatly from store to store and sometimes you can find good bargains, but, certainly when I grew up, there was some stigma attached to them, but these days, and with adults, I doubt very much that anyone would really care.",0,1409184047,null,0,false,0,ck2cksf,t3_2ep0o3,t1_ck2cksf,t3_2ep0o3,null,1427326432,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of the views you think are extreme are actually held by a large proportion of muslims: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV710c1dgpU#t=146

* Thirty percent of British Muslims would prefer to live under Sharia (Islamic religious) law than under British law.

* Twenty-eight percent hope for the U.K. one day to become a fundamentalist Islamic state. 

* Almost one in four British Muslims believe that last year's 7/7 attacks on London were justified because of British support for the U.S.-led war on terror.

* Seventy-eight percent support punishment for the people who earlier this year published cartoons featuring the Prophet Mohammed. Sixty-eight percent support the arrest and prosecution of those British people who ""insult Islam."" When asked if free speech should be protected, even if it offends religious groups, 62 percent of British Muslims say No, it should not.

&gt;All you're doing is using personal impressions and spreading them around as if they're fact. I have emboldened the qualitative words you're ascribing to people- these are irrelevant and immeasurable. You're just echoing your personal confirmatory bias.

These two points are related. The fact that most Pakistanis in the US are under the radar, do not ghettoize, and the fact that all the Pakistanis I've met here are well educated doctors or IT professionals who hold liberal views is similar to the difference of Canadian vs UK or US Sikhs. I'm arguing that the Pakistani problem in Britain does not mean Pakistanis are like that; only *within* Britain are they so contemptuous, just like how only Sikhs within Canada behave a certain way. To say its because of overall ""Pakistani"" or ""Muslim"" culture is ludicrous given the educated Pakistani Muslims living in the US and elsewhere. Now, to say that Pakistanis who come to Britain from a particularly socioeconomically backward segment of Pakistani/Punjabi society should be kept watch on is perfectly rational.

&gt;What's becoming obvious, however, is that you're showing signs of contempt for your co-religionists in another country in an apparent sign of superiority. 

Haha. Just as you're showing content for your fellow British Asians of another religion?

As a minority, if someone identifies as Sikh, they need to be a positive beacon for the religion or there will be negative stereotypes. So I do have a problem with [Canadian Sikhs](http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Assassinated+journalist+Tara+Singh+Hayer+mourned+years+after+death/7567608/story.html) hospitalizing and killing journalists they disagree with, [Canadian Sikhs](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U0RYWYkY98o) joining gangs, shooting up rivals, and specifically picking Punjabi names and asserting their Sikh identity to show that they're not Hindu or Muslim, [Canadian Sikhs](http://www.boston.com/news/world/articles/2003/10/05/mom_gave_long_distance_order_for_honor_killing_police_say/?page=fulland) doing honor killings, [Canadian Sikhs](https://circle.ubc.ca/handle/2429/14888) participating in domestic abuse! and [Canadian Sikhs](http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2012/10/14/indocanadian_truck_drivers_from_gta_caught_in_web_of_north_american_drug_trade.html) who drive trucks and are part of huge drug smuggling heists. Are there many honest Sikhs in Canada? Absolutely, my cousin is one, Jagmeet Singh is another. The majority are good people. I would say the majority of Pakistanis in Britain don't participate in this. But is there a significantly disproportionate member of the Jatt Sikh (I only say that because Khatris don't suffer the same problems) community that is in the drug trade or worse in Canada? Absolutely, and if you're denying it, take off the rose tinted glasses. Or even worse, lay off the ethnocentrism; it's a similar exact ethnocentrism that compels these Pakistanis to avoid Muslim women. 

&gt;I'm not blaming Islam for those problems.

Apologies, I thought this is what you were saying. I agree.

&gt;I'm saying those problems afflict the Muslim Pakistani community. I have not supported a correlation-causation fallacy because I'm pinning this on the Pakistani community.

*the Muslim Pakistani population *in Britain*. Of which I am sure is disproportionately Mirpuris who cause the problem. So my British Sikh friend tells me anyway.",0,1409185137,null,0,false,0,ck2d25z,t3_2emih6,t1_ck2d25z,t1_ck2c6b6,null,1427326132,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,MJRocky,null,null,"Ok for the sake of discussion let's say Falcao does indeed move to Madrid. I think we can all agree that Falcao is a better striker than Benzema, and would probably supplant him as first choice. And if Benz wants to be first choice enough to request a transfer, where is he to go? Let's take a look.

*I highly doubt he'd stay in Spain, as the two other elite teams in the league are main rivals of Madrid. So a move abroad makes more sense.

*Gemany: Bayern have Lewandowski that they just signed. Dortmund signed two strikers, and Schalke, while a good team, might be a bit of a step down.

*Italy: Juventus have Llorente, Tevez, Giovinco, and Morata. Despite playing 2 strikers, they're well stacked at the position. Roma has Destro and Totti, who Benzema is better than but unless Totti retires soon it might be tough replacing him. Napoli have Higuain, the guy Benz already competed with. AC Milan need a striker, but don't have the competitive or financial incentives to entice right now.

*France: PSG have 2 of probably the top 5-7 strikers in the world. I have hard time seeing Benzema go to any other French team tbh, although if Falcao were to leave that would conceivably open up a spot at Monaco.

*England: Manchester City have 2 elite strikers and 2 very good strikers. Liverpool have Balotelli and Sturridge. Man U (lol) have RVP and Rooney. Arsenal have Giroud who Benz is better than. 

If Benzema wanted to leave Madrid but stay at an elite team, Chelsea would be his best bet. Chelsea is actively trying to get rid of Torres, and Drogba is 36 and only on a 1-year contract. That leaves Diego Costa as our only long-term first team striker. If he was adamant about being first choice, he'd have to take a step down in terms of the team he'd go to (Arsenal, Roma, Schalke, Monaco etc.) And he's already played under Mourinho. The reason he'd be first choice in any other team that wants him is because the top teams have top strikers already.",0,1409185339,null,0,false,0,ck2d5e3,t3_2eqbyn,t1_ck2d5e3,t1_ck1zbsh,null,1427326090,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

In my state school we had studied practical use of language (i.e. basics of grammar with some vocab thrown in), and the only book I had read in French was *Le Petit Prince*. When an Oxbridge don sat me down and asked me to analyse texts by Andre Gide, I was completely lost. My French was also much worse than an average private school student as I had literally never spoken to a French native speaker, as my department at school was two teachers who were English native speakers and who taught us in English.

&gt; There could be no grosser misconception of the realities than is entertained by those who vociferously demand legislation as they call it ""against discrimination"", whether they be leader writers of the same kidney and sometimes on the same news papers which year after year in the 1930s tried to blind this country to the rising peril which confronted it, or archbishops who live in palaces, faring delicately with the bedclothes pulled right up over their heads.  They have got it exactly and diametrically wrong. **The discrimination and the deprivation, the sense of alarm and of resentment, lies not with the immigrant population but with those among whom they have come and are still coming.  This is why to enact legislation of the kind before parliament at this moment is to risk throwing a match on to gunpowder.**  The kindest thing that can be said about those who propose and support it is that they know not what they do.

He opposes anti-discrimination laws, saying that the 'discrimination and the deprivation, the sense of alarm and of resentment' lies with the native population, not the immigrants. This is only 3 years after the Race Relations Act of 1965, and before that time people could be discriminated against based on colour (though admittedly it wasn't as wide spread as in the US). To claim that the natives are more discriminated against than immigrants is frankly absurd. Although he does say he wants equality between immigrants and none-immigrants in the paragraph before, it is telling that he opposes any legislation to achieve that.

&gt; The Commonwealth immigrant came to Britain as a full citizen, **to a country which knew no discrimination between one citizen and another**, and he entered instantly into the possession of the rights of every citizen, from the vote to free treatment under the National Health Service.  **Whatever drawbacks attended the immigrants arose not from the law or from public policy or from administration, but from those personal circumstances and accidents which cause, and always will cause, the fortunes and experience of one man to be different from another's**.

He denies there is any sort of discrimination based upon race, rather saying if an immigrant has misfortune, it is the same as any other person having a misfortune. It completely ignores the discrimination immigrants faced in the UK, like the Bristol Omnibus Company refusing to hire non-white drivers, political figures running on (or at least refusing to condemn) racist slogans like 'If you want a nigger for a neighbour, vote Labour', or nationalist far-right groups like the Union Movement and White Defence League lynching none-white and using now infamous phrases like 'Keep Britain White'. 

&gt; Now we are seeing the growth of positive forces acting against integration, of vested interests in the preservation and sharpening of racial and religious differences, with a **view to the exercise of actual domination, first over fellow-immigrants and then over the rest of the population.**

While Enoch was only quoting someone when he said ""In this country in 15 or 20 years' time the black man will have the whip hand over the white man"", he mirrors that view in his own words here. It implies that immigrants are scheming to take over, which they haven't. It's scaremongering against the immigrant population.

Now, inb4 someone says that the Rotherham sex abuse scandal shows this domination, there is a stark difference between using the victim card and 'you're racist for calling me out' to protect criminals, and immigrants having domination over the non-immigrant population. Immigrants have very little actual power in the country, such as power in government or over business. They don't have the sort of domination Enoch scaremongers about.

 He goes on to quote a Labour MP John Stonehouse to show this attempt to take over:

&gt; ""The Sikh communities' campaign to maintain customs inappropriate in Britain is much to be regretted.  Working in Britain, particularly in the public services, they should be prepared to accept the terms and conditions of their employment.  To claim special communal rights (or should they say rites?) leads to a dangerous fragmentation within society.  This communalism is a canker;  whether practised by one colour or another it is to be strongly condemned.""

His best example for immigrants wanting domination over non-immigrant populations is 'the Sikh communities' wanting to retain some customs. Hardly domination in my opinion.

&gt; **For these dangerous and divisive elements the legislation proposed in the Race Relations Bill is the very pabulum they need to flourish.**  Here is the means of showing that the immigrator communities can organise to consolidate their members, to agitate and campaign against their fellow citizens, and to overawe and dominate the rest with the legal weapons which the ignorant and the ill-informed have provided.

Again, he suggests that anti-discrimination laws are bad, and that they enable what he defines as 'dangerous and divisive elements' (referring to the 'Sikh communities' in the paragraph before) to flourish. 

And, again, before someone suggests these anti-discrimination laws have allowed some Pakistani communities in Rotherham to abuse vulnerable people, there is nothing in anti-discrimination laws that perpetuate the view that if you implicate an immigrant (or relative of an immigrant) in a crime, you're racist. They are their to oppose actual discrimination, both to immigrants and non-immigrants, such as those felt before 1965 (and later amendments which expanded them), where people could be banned from shops or jobs simply because of their skin colour, nationality or sex. 

So, while there is no smoking gun 'I hate blacks' racist comment, in the speech Enoch concluded that discrimination doesn't happen in the UK, and when it does it is mainly felt by non-immigrants, that anti-discrimination laws are bad because they will offend non-immigrants and will allow dangerous and divisive elements in the immigrant community to flourish, and that immigrants are seeking to dominate the non-immigrant population. This is all wrapped up in a lot of scaremongering. 

While you might not be able to pick out a racist line (although I'd suggest there are racist undertones), Enoch most definitely was not right, unless you don't think discrimination has ever happened in Britain to someone based on race, or if you think discrimination laws are a bad thing, or if you think immigrants are trying to dominate the non-immigrant population.

So, while there is no smoking gun 'I hate blacks' racist comment, in the speech Enoch concluded that discrimination doesn't happen in the UK, and when it does it is mainly felt by non-immigrants, that anti-discrimination laws are bad because they will offend non-immigrants and will allow dangerous and divisive elements in the immigrant community to flourish, and that immigrants are seeking to dominate the non-immigrant population. This is all wrapped up in a lot of scaremongering.

While you might not be able to pick out a racist line (although I'd suggest there are racist undertones), Enoch most definitely was not right, unless you don't think discrimination has ever happened in Britain to someone based on race, or if you think discrimination laws are a bad thing, or if you think immigrants are trying to dominate the non-immigrant population.

In both cases paedophiles are ruthlessly exploiting the situation they find themselves in. But the BBC is a large corporation, with managers, an HR department, the ability to hire and fire, and a responsibility to the children they brought into contact with their staff.

The Pakistani ""community"" are private UK citizens. Some of them may choose to live in the same parts of town, and share cultural and religious values. But if there are paedophiles amongst them, it is down to social services and the police to catch them. Exactly the same as I would expect where I live.

* Benteke? (haven't been really tracking him recently)
* Welbeck (HG, so we might go after him.I dont rate him though)


Young promising players that could play as 2nd choice:

* Lacazette (best one imo)
* Muriel (had a poor season but was really promising before)
* Wickham (HG, has talent, started to live up to it last season)
* Max Kruse (not really a typical forward but plays a bit deeper, like a Messi type role. Scores a lot of goals and is very creative.)
* Destro

Probably a couple names I might have missed but from what I have seen of these players they are most likely people Chelsea would be looking into. Many of these players are highly regarded and valued by their clubs and would really require us to overpay to obtain their services. If we do get another striker this window we really are going to pay an amount that they probably are not worth. We still need it though.

As shown recently with the Rotherham abuse scandal, the fear of being seen to be racist is more corrosive than many people realise and I am in disbelief about how many people live in constant fear about what is and what isn't racist. It's as if they are more afraid about how others interpret them, rather than what they actually intend to convey. Fear of being seen as racist shouldn't be the driving factor behind anti racism, rather it should be understanding of the corrosiveness of racism and therein lies the crucial difference. 
 
The raging pitchforkers are, in my opinion, just as 'bad' as the bigots themselves. I'm sure there are people out there that would think I'm racist for believing the old 'if you don't like western values, don't live here' line of argument.

&gt;

&gt;___Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death___ (commonly shortened to ___The Curse of Fatal Death___) is a two-episode special of *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)* made for the [Red Nose Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_Relief_(charity\)) charity [telethon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telethon) in the United Kingdom, and broadcast on [BBC One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_One) on 12 March 1999. It follows in a long tradition of popular British television programmes producing short, light-hearted specials for such telethon events.

&gt;It has a special status amongst *Doctor Who*-themed charity productions. It has twice been featured on the cover of *[Doctor Who Magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_Magazine)*  - an unusual feat even for a regular episode of the programme. It is the only [parodic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parody) story to be covered by ""DWM Archives"", a section of *DWM* normally reserved for discussion of past episodes of the regular series. Similarly, it is the only parody to be given an extensive behind-the-scenes article on the BBC official website,  and its own video release through BBC Video. It is also the only BBC-commissioned [live-action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live-action) *Doctor Who* production between [the *Doctor Who* television movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(1996_film\)) and [""Rose""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_(Doctor_Who_episode\)).

&gt;Finally, it serves as a production bridge - if not a narrative bridge - between the 1963 and 2005 versions of the programme. Most notable amongst the many connections between ""old"" and ""new"" versions is the fact that it showcases the first televised *Doctor Who* script by [Steven Moffat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Moffat), the first post-production work of [The Mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mill_(post-production\)) on the programme, the only time a woman produced an episode of the programme between [Verity Lambert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verity_Lambert) and [Susie Liggat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susie_Liggat), and the final performance by the longest-serving Dalek vocal artist, [Roy Skelton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Skelton). Executive Producer [Richard Curtis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Curtis) would later write the 2010 episode ""[Vincent and the Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_and_the_Doctor)"". [Richard E. Grant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_E._Grant), who plays the alternative Tenth Doctor would later appear on the actual show, as the main antagonist of the seventh series, the [Great Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Intelligence), after performing the voice of another version of the Ninth Doctor in an animated webcast serial *[Scream of the Shalka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scream_of_the_Shalka)*.

true,yhkim1219,null,null,"Sigh.. Here we go, bring the downvotes:


I so deeply disagree with the criticisms from the article. Starting with the first line, but first of all let's define elitism: From what I've been reading and from what I've been told you guys define it as - A group of rich people who hogs a lot of the high end jobs, by mostly networking with each other, sends their kids to the best (most cases private) schools and university, then these students going off to do the 'high end' jobs thus creating a cycle.


I'll get to this later but let's analyse the article:

&gt;Britain is still ""deeply elitist"" with privately-educated pupils and Oxbridge graduates continuing to dominate top roles in society, a major new report warns


Why is this a bad thing? Surely the whole purpose of Oxbridge is to pick the brightest, then send them off to do the most difficult jobs, which also happens to be the top roles in society (they are top roles due to their difficulty) and they also pay the most.


Now with the issue of privately educated students dominating the Oxbridge placements. This to me isn't very surprising. If you have been in school recently (worked there or go there) I'm sure you will know the sheer difference in the level of education private schools offers compared to government run schools. And this isn't very surprising either. Private school teachers are paid more, they are majority of the times better run, they have better resources and finance. For example when I was in school, my favourite maths teacher (who went to Oxford btw) left for a private school. Why? because he wished to get married soon and the private school offered higher pay, plus they also offered free housing! With 'upgrades' the longer he stayed. Also the school was much better run, more efficient so there was essentially less to do, less stress and more free time. My headmaster tried to persuade him to stay, by making him deputy head of department (even though he's only been a teacher for &gt;2years), because he was so good! However the offer wasn't enough. Now some of you may call out my teacher and go on about his passion for teaching blah blah ""oh~ think of the children!"" but seriously why would you? He's doing it for his family.


These types of things happen all the time. The best teachers majority of the times gets attracted into the private sector (and stay) because it is so much better than the alternative in so many ways. This will inherently make private schools better and so make the education better. 


It's not just the teachers that are different. It is the parents and students too (students less so, but still noticeably different). Parents are paying tens of thousands of pounds in addition to their taxes which they already pay by default for their children's education. These parents are determined for their kids to get the best education in the best schools by the best teachers, no matter the costs. They will encourage their children to study and support them a lot more than the average parent, no matter the costs; they will hire tutors, buy books, stationary, etc. And do you blame them? Most of them are also very clever, who have gone through the system themselves so knows the importance of education (this is also a difference, since ""cleverer"" parents are able to help their children a lot more, for longer and better. Some parents I've talked to aren't able to do KS3 level stuff, let alone GCSE's and Alevel's). These ""elitist"" parents are indeed rich, but that's more because of their skills and intelligence, which allows them to have higher paying jobs. PLEASE don't go on about ""Oh these rich people inherited all their money blah blah or these rich people have their own group that favours 'their kind' only."" These types of people are in a huge minority. If you actually see the children's parents they are majority of the times 'middle class' people. By this I mean the household would earn probably just above 50k. ALSO more and more of these parents are past generation immigrants i.e. Chinese, French, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, American, etc people who came only a few decades ago. So your argument amount this elitist social circle is a big exaggeration. I accept that it exists, but it isn't such a big phenomenon. Finally, these parents HAVE the money. They can spare the money, so they will do whatever they can to improve their children's life. Some of you will frown at this and be like ""oh they spend 30k on their schools! They spend thousands on tutors and other stuff! It's unfair!"" Well that's fucking life. Are you seriously going to criticize parents wanting the best of their children? If you earned as much as they do, surely you would do the same. You're not going to go to your kids and say ""sorry you were born into a rich family, but because I don't want to look bad I'm sending you to a 'worse' school"". Some may actually agree with this, but I certainly don't because you are purposely disabling your kids a good education because of some jealous or idealist people who cannot accept that life is inherently unfair.


Now some of you will tell me that we should get rid of these ""elitist"" private schools since it's unfair for the poorer people who cannot get the same level of education. I sympathies with this and I completely understand, I myself come from a poor background. However, it isn't the correct way. If you merge the private schools with the state schools, you are very quickly going to get rid of the best schools since majority of the best schools are private (for the reasons I've mentioned above). This won't improve the education sector, it'll drastically hurt it. You would think now that teachers aren't congregated into the private schools, they would be evenly distributed and steadily the level of schools will increase. WRONG. This cannot be any more wrong. Do you know what the ""best"" teachers will do? Leave teaching and go into the private sector. Why? Well, since it's all government run now, everyone's pay would have to be relatively the same (unless you want performance related pay), so there is a decrease in pay, what about the perks like free housing that comes with it? Well you can't give it to one teacher and not give it to another, so that's a big no no. But then surely the schools will be better run right? Nope. A big proportion of the best head teachers, staff will probably leave too. 

This country already has a massive problem with hiring teachers in the first place, almost all positions in teaching (especially maths, science and english) are not filled. Why do you think Teach First was created, the 20k grant for becoming a teacher? If you do this to get rid of elitism, then it'll make things worse. **You need to bring the state schools level up to the private level standards, not the other way round.**


Now some of you will interpret this as me saying state schools and their parents sucks and that there is no hope for these children.. Sigh.. Have an open mind. I'm not saying that you can't have a good education if you go to a state school, my points are that due to current circumstances i.e. finance, politics, lack of teachers, etc, the average education of private schools is inevitably higher than the average of state schools. If you are a parent, or a student, I'm sure you would agree with me in saying this and also if I say that - If you try hard enough (probably more than the ones in the private sector in actual fact) then you will get a good education. I mean schools are what you make of it. If you try hard then you will get a better education. It doesn't matter how bad the school is, albeit, the worse the school, the harder you will have to try. 


It is these things in the state education sector that the government has to tackle but is finding it so hard to do. The absolute main reason is the stock of teachers. Like I said before, better teachers tend to go to the private sector, coupled with the lack of teachers filling in the needed places each year, this creates a huge problem. In Britain, as you all know have a big influx of children recently, so hundreds of primary schools has to be built (and soon secondary to the same level). But how are you going to do this without the available teachers? People cry about this every other month and it pisses me off to no end, since you just expect the government to magically build stone structures and call them schools, with magical teachers to fill the place. Doesn't work like that people. Also the current recession isn't really helping, since it's understandably difficult to increase the education budget, seeing as how other sectors like the NHS is constrained, plus gove's stupid spending habits did not help either. 


Any that's my rant on private schools and you lot going on about private schools.

true,yhkim1219,null,null,"Now my rant on the disproportionate representation in the ""top jobs.""

&gt;More than seven in ten (71%) of senior judges, 62% of senior armed forces officers, over half of permanent secretaries (55%) - the most senior civil servants in government - 53% of senior diplomats, 45% of public body chairs, 44% of the Sunday Times Rich List, 43% of newspaper columnists, 35% of national rugby teams, a third (33%) of the England cricket team and 26% of BBC executives attended a fee-paying school, the study found.

&gt;Former private school pupils are also over-represented in politics, with half of the House of Lords attending an independent school along with over a third (36%) of the Cabinet, a third (33%) of MPs, and 22% of the shadow cabinet.


Okay if you have read my rant on education, you will understand my reasoning in saying: of course the higher types of jobs will be disproportionately filled with private sector education children. They get the better education! This allows them to get into better universities! Then they go and get better jobs! Big surprise there! Unless you want less qualified people to get into the higher end jobs because you don't think the proportion of it is right because of your egalitarian ideals that somehow got into your brain. Is this really that surprising? Stop blaming the children who go to private schools and their parents who wants the best for them.


Do your best in your education (if you are a student), do your best as a parent (by encouraging them, help them in time management etc, you don't necessarily have to spend money or teach him the subject) and if you are neither, then think about maybe becoming a teacher?
OR better yet, stop bloody degrading the profession. I swear this and the US are the only countries in the world where the teachers (and some other professions like nurses) are so badly looked down upon. It's like a second class job and considered to be where the rejects who couldn't make it to the private sector go. What the hell? Also this stupid belief that anyone can become a teacher, if they just put their mind to it, anyone from the private sector without any training or experience can magically become the best teachers at anytime they want. Well no you can't.


&gt;The statistics also reveal the numbers in each profession who went to Oxford or Cambridge.

&gt;The most over-represented professions were the judiciary, with 75% of senior judges attending one of these two universities, along with 59% of the Cabinet, 57% of permanent secretaries, and 50% of diplomats.

&gt;In addition, 47% of newspaper columnists are Oxbridge graduates, as are 38% of the House of Lords, 33% of the Shadow Cabinet and 24% of MPs.


Read my previous reasonings, I'm quite happy and also feel reassured that the one of the most important professions i.e. the judiciary system, is filled with those who were best educated.


Now I understand the contempt at the disproportions of the cabinet, since purpose of that is to reflect their communities, but this contempt is I think is more due to the failures of the MPs and even due to the media BS that goes on so much in this country. I don't necessarily think changes to the universities that they went to would have made much change, but probably the types of people that get into parliament. 

However, this bit is one of the most confusing to me. You guys live in a democracy right? You have the power to decide who gets into parliament. So surely it is more the fault of the citizens for (not) voting for the people you do not want to be your representative? If you really don't want these disproportionality then go ahead and vote according to which university your candidate went to. No one's stopping you. I'm not sure why you would want to, but go right ahead. I'd rather you vote based on that than not vote at all.


Ok my rant about this is gone.

You know - it personally took me years to recognize how bad Islam is.  I've had several close Muslim friends and they weren't threatening, so surely this fear of Islam is just the usual racist scaremongering right?  After all - who are the biggest critics of Muslims?

But I think I was wrong.  I've slowly come to realize that Islam is extraordinarily dangerous.  Even if most Muslims themselves are decent people, their ideology, when taken to its logical conclusions is fascist, for want of a better word.

true,PredatorOfTheDaleks,jack,Jack Harkness,"Theory regarding the droids and why they are different to The Girl in the Fireplace clockwork droids. 

Both ships from 51st century. Both on a mission to reach The Promised Land. Possibly the name of a place.  Possible actually trying to reach paradise. 

Madamme de Pompadour ship breaks down somewhere and clockwork droids repair it using the crews body parts but the Doctor stops them before they get Madame de Pompadour brain to replace central computer.

Marie Antoinette breaks down on Earth in prehistoric times. Same thing happens. Clockwork Droids kill entire crew to repair ship but damage is too high. Can't punch hole in time to kidnap Marie Antoinette like the other ship.  The droids are programmed to repair ship at any cost so when they start to break down from being old and worn they start killing people to repair ***themselves***, not just the ship, as their computer logic reasons that if they die the ship cannot be repaired. They constantly repair themselves with mechanical and organic matter over millenia. 

They've stuffed so much into them that they are no longer anything of the original. As the Doctor's broom analogy. Explaing why they are no longer clockwork droids and have an apparent different logic to them. 

They have stuffed so much humanity into them (especially brain matter) that they start to think with more free will and gain smarter techniques (torcher etc). Concepts such as heaven and paradise and pursuit of happiness are now engrained into them from all the humanity they have which is why they are searching for Paradise. Possible that the original SS Marie Antoinette mission was just to a place called Paradise or absolutely different mission.

Think of it like a divorcing couple with a disgustingly giant mortgage on a house with an absolutely brilliant swimming pool. The wife wants to keep the house but never wants to see the husband again, she doesn't want him using the pool. 

If the husband gets even 1% of the ownership of the house he has access rights to that pool and there's nothing the wife can do about it. That also makes him liable for the disgusting mortgage though, but he's willing to pay that price to keep getting in the lovely pool.

The only way the wife can completely lock him out of that pool is to take 100% ownership of the house. She gets her pool all to herself but she also gets the disgusting mortgage all to herself. 

-----

The primary problem rUK/BoE have is that in terms of national debt Scotland doesn't actually exist. All that debt was signed for by the Bank of England, it's their duty to pay and the people who loaned the money probably wouldn't be too happy to wake up one day to find it's been given away to some other tiny new country. If they reject CU 10% gets wiped from the economy but the related 10% debt doesn't. That's the equivelant of the 2008 crash.

The primary problem for iScotland is that there are other ways around it. A new Scottish central bank could buy debt from the BoE of the equivalent value and if discussions go the absolute hardline no-CU route it would probably have to be done or Scotland would be seen to be defaulting on debt. Not *officially* but it would effect ratings. 

----

Swinney is essentially gambling the entire deck on getting CU. In every other area he's happy with simple asset split, something rUK can't realistically turn down without getting crucified internationally. He's betting that keeping our 10% of the economy + a good deal on Faslane + a great deal of control over our economy is enough to buy CU. 

I think he's also betting that the fall out of not taking the debt wouldn't be as bad as claimed.

You are confusing how he said he had ""lived"" for 900 as 11. (""200"" with Amy/Rory/River (assume he goes on other, untold/uneventful adventures, with or with out them; This is true for all the Doctors, BTW), 200 after ""The Angels take Manhattan"" (Implicitly stated in ""the Snowmen""), then we can assume 100 more, puttzing around ""searching"" for Clara, Then another 100 or so once he finds her (Same deal as with Amy, etc.,) AND THEN the 300 he spends defending the Town of Christmas. 200 + 200 + 100 + 100 + 300 = **900**. Besides, he was probably rounding anyway.

*""fourth wall break explanation""* The writers simply forgot/didn't care what the last quoted ""age"" was and so they conveniently Ret-conned that detail when the series was rebooted. What they didn't expect was that the old fans were wise to this and pitched a fit. The argument could have been made that The Doctor, by this point, quit counting  really, and kinda... *just forgot.* However, they decided to drop in the ""the doctor lies"" bit to explain this (and other) continuity flub(s) away. (*see also*, ""wibbly wobbly, timey-wimey."")
This could have been ""good enough"" but, if you notice, they have 11 just BURN though centuries. This was in an ""effort"" to have 12's age be more ""appropriate"" and ""in line with *proper* continuity/cannon.""
On the other hand, the whole ""doctor lies"" thing also opens up the possibility that 9 and 10 (10 especially) were mis-quoting due to their vanity, and 10 traveled a lot more than we are led to believe where as 11 traveled a bit less. Taken in this light, it could be argued that 12 is now quoting His age accurately, as he mentions that his face must be the result of trying to tell himself something subconsciously. The Doctor was not young because he was trying to think of Rose, or because of some inverse effect on the duration of his incarnation, he was ""young"" because he was lying-*lying to himself.* And that's a very childish thing to do. He was young because he was doing what he did in his youth; Run from his problems. And that's a childish thing to do.

The Moment shows the War Doctor what he will become: First, ""the Man **WHO** Mourns*, then second, ""the Man *WHO* Forgets"" (To imply that the Doctor forgets not only his age, and also, the details of the end of the time war, but more crucially, he forgets who he *really is.* However, this does encompass other things as well, just not as pointedly.)

^*the ^subtext ^here ^is ^more ^straightforward: ^He ^mourns ^the ^loss ^of ^his ^race, ^Rose, ^the ^Master, ^Donna, ^probably ^also ^could ^extend ^to ^Sarah ^Jane ^Smith, ^the ^Brigadier, ^possibly ^even ^Astrid ^Peth, ^and ^Madame ^Pompadour ^if ^we ^are ^to ^be ^thorough.  ^Hell,  ^10 ^has ^to ^deal ^with ^the ^loss ^of ^River ^Song, ^as ^soon ^as ^He ^meets ^her, ^he ^must ^mourn ^her.

The (supposed) reason that the Doctor can't consciously choose his face, is because there is a theory that state's he was one of the last Gallefreians to be *born*, not loomed as most other Time Lords are  Romana was Loomed, so she had the ability to ""regenerate"" at will, not just because she suffered a mortal wound, or became frail with old age. Also, she was of Aristocratic stock, so she probably had special dispensation from the High Council to ""Regenerate"" when ever and however she wished. (She basically had moderator powers, to draw a crude analogy)
Therefore, to draw any comparisons between the Doctor's and Romana's  individual regeneration cycles is shaky to say the least.

The current Doctor looks old because he had to remind himself that he IS old and he should grow up and deal with his problems like an adult.
He says he made a lot of mistakes, and it's time he did something about that. It's the Doctor telling himself that he can't solve his problems by moping about, or running from them, or pretending they don't exist. He's  been playing around and goofing off.

&gt;The [TARDIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS) materialises on a seemingly derelict spaceship drifting in space. The Doctor, Rose, and Mickey explore the ship and are puzzled to find an eighteenth century French fireplace. When he looks through the fireplace, the Doctor sees a young girl and asks who she is. She replies that her name is Reinette and that she lives in Paris in 1727. The Doctor deduces that the fireplace is a time window, a device that allows direct access to another time and place. The Doctor steps through the time window and arrives in Reinette's bedroom only to find that months have passed there. He discovers a ticking humanoid wearing eighteenth century clothing and a jester's mask hiding under Reinette's bed. The Doctor tricks the creature into returning through the time window to the spacecraft, where he and his companions learn that it is actually an intricate clockwork android. The android teleports away, and the Doctor warns Mickey and Rose not to go looking for it. The Doctor returns to Reinette's bedroom while Mickey and Rose arm themselves and go looking for the android. Returning to Reinette's bedroom, the Doctor discovers that she is now a young woman. She flirts with the Doctor and they kiss, but she is forced to leave to answer a summons. The Doctor then realises that she is [Madame de Pompadour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madame_de_Pompadour), the mistress of [King Louis XV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XV_of_France).

They see it as a corrupt old boys club for the establishment. It's heavily corporate, the ticket prices are expensive, you can't drink alcohol on a match day - in spite of the fact that Heineken are a major sponsor of the Champions League.

Then you have Platini and FFP.

I think the novelty wore off for a lot of blues very quickly.

Take a look at complaints about ticket prices and the cost of following City now on bluemoon, when people talk of ditching cup schemes they usually mention the Champions League first.

There's also the fact that those kind of fixtures attract the football tourists, and with the high ticket prices a lot of the core support don't attend and they're replaced with day trippers and plastics who don't mind paying a fortune for a one off glamour fixture.

So, the atmosphere suffers, heavily.

Honestly, it's not enjoyable watching a game surrounded by people wearing half and half scarves recording the match on their iPhones or taking pictures of opposition free kicks and penalties with digital cameras.

It's horrible in fact.

I still remember how incredible the atmosphere was for the UEFA Cup quarter final against Hamburg back in 2009, so it can be done. But for those of you who didn't know, the price of an adult ticket for that game was £5 - yes, 5 quid. We hadn't sold out the previous fixtures and City wanted a full stadium roaring the boys on, so they introduced that one off price policy.

And it worked.

Unless you wish to argue that the 7% of private schooled children are all firmly to the right of that curve then you have to accept that they will broadly fall in a distributed pattern along that curve.

I'd also contend that you misunderstand the purpose of private schools. Parents are not paying thousands of pounds for their children to learn more about botany. The ROI on this investment comes in the form of grades. Grades which allow access to superior universities. Private schools provide superior preparation for examinations at GCSE and A-level. 

This is evident when you look at the performance of private schooled and state schooled students at universities. State schooled students perform at the same level or better than their private schooled peers. Your argument does not account for this.

Private schools give people a huge leg up during a critical period; a very narrow window in which life chances are formed. 

And all of this would be to completely ignore the fact that highly privileged people are huddled together at an early age in a breeding den of nepotism. Whose back do you think they have? In whose favour do you think they will mobilise Father's trust fund? Who will they elect to cabinet?

In short, your argument that they are better educated is not supported by studies on state and private schooled students at university; and education should not be conceived as directly translatable into ability.",0,1409203777,null,0,false,0,ck2kl8f,t3_2eqduu,t1_ck2kl8f,t1_ck2f7p7,null,1427322016,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Unfortunately, we don't have a collective name that we call ourselves.  In the circles that I run in, if you live in the city, you are ""from the 'Ham"".  The more affluent, white collar types live south of the city, in the suburbs of Homewood, Vestavia, and Hoover, which is collectively called ""Over the Mountain"".

Our nickname is the ""Magic City"", and here - college football is king.  The University of Alabama (of which, I am NOT a fan) dominates the sport nationally, and the in-state rivalry is Auburn University.  When they play, it's called the ""Iron Bowl"".    College football starts this weekend, and until New Years, you will find it tough to have a discussion with anybody from Birmingham unless you throw a ""Roll Tide"" or ""War Eagle"" into the conversation.

We expect the brushed-aluminium Dan Miler tyoes to lead our parties, and hold the whip. Policy has become less important than personality, and the respective parties appear to be obsessed with projecting the right look. Cameron's airbrushed posters should tell you all you need to know; he looked better than Gordon Brown so folks voted for him, despite the manifesto being as thin as supermarket own-brand lavatory paper.

My mother-in-law summed it up nicely for me (inadvertently, I might add) when she saw Thanet South's Labour candidate. ""Oh, he looks about twelve. I don't like him. A twelve year old in a suit."" I asked her if she's listened to anything he had to say, or whether she knew about his history (Thanet born and raised, current mayor of Margate, majored in politics so probably pretty committed. A career-politician-in-waiting) but she just said ""Look at him. Just look at him.""

When people talk about their politicians being someone they could have a pint with this disturbs me greatly. Politicians have traditionally *not* been someone you could have a pint with, except perhaps in the North back in the sixties and seventies. If yo ureally want to vote for the man on the street then vote for the man on the fucking street, not someone who has obviously been groomed and coached. Niggle and Boris are certainly not men of the street, they only act like it because their image gurus have taught them this.

It only boils down to that old chestnut: people don't listen to what you have to say, only how you say it and how you look when you say it. People are shallow, have short memories and are disinterested in politics generally. The right man could stand in front of them and have them all voting for a tax on oxygen.

true,SocialMediaEd,null,null,"I'm the social media editor at the Independent so I read this with interest (through wet salty tears). I'm on my holidays right now... easy opt out but it is true, honest.

First thing to say is that a lot of these headlines came from our sister site i100.co.uk which is not meant to be the independent... they were just tweeted from the main account. Something a bit more internet friendly if you will. And yes, it seems to be a format everyone is using a lot more these days, but sometimes it is a good format. For example, the signs we live in a rape culture. http://i100.independent.co.uk/article/14-signs-we-live-in-a-rape-culture--gk_rqcmxml I prefer reading this in this style, than a long essay.

The other thing, which I think someone has already pointed out, is that you can't fit the whole article on Twitter..There will always be the 'information gap' that characterises so much of really cheesy click bait. Even if you aren't trying to purposefully tease people. 

The other thing is that quite a lot of people do actually want to read this lighter content, especially if they are accessing the content through social networks.. it's just about light and shade.  We do tweet quite a lot of serious stuff too.. These are just some examples.. it's just a sample of our output.

I will however take your points on board.. Good news for iPhone users is not a great sell for any story. It's a bit generic clickbaity, and you're right.. we can do better than that.   

I don't see too much wrong with a reminder of Richard Attenborough's best movies though. And if you do have a round up of the best skincare.. how would you tweet that? 

And... don't tell me you didn't want to know what came out as the best cheese for pizza in a 'scientific' study. Because you did.

You've got to do what's best for the country, not what's best for some people. If she decided not to do what she did, she would only have one other option: Sign us over to the Eu. I don't think it's that she had no empathy, as she actually had lot's of empathy, it's just that the austerity measures being put in place would hurt the working class. Either decision would have hurt the working class, but I would rather be hurt and still independent. But then Labour managed to gain power for a long time and broke the country, but they still convince the working class that they're ""for the man"" and still manage to be successful. It's absurd.

true,the_oncoming_storm,CommonWeal,,"I think it unlikely that any of the three unionist parties will see more independence from their UK parties until its members see it as essential for electoral success.

If there's a No vote, I think the referendum campaign is unlikely to hamper the Tory vote, but we might see a backlash from Yes voting Labour and LibDem supporters. I don't have a good feel for how significant that might be, but I wouldn't be surprised to see the LibDem vote collapse even further to the SNP. 

I genuinely fear for the LIbDem party in Scotland. I've no idea how big their core vote is, but they're not likely to be winning more friends at the moment. I think Danny Alexander might get his Portillo moment next year.

We should remember that a Lib/Lab coalition is the natural alternative to an SNP government, so such a scenario might well deliver another SNP majority, especially if they declare that they won't have another referendum in the next parliament. 

Scottish Labour's hatred for the SNP has been holding them back since they lost power, and I don't see any change in that attitude coming soon if there's a No vote. One of the big problems with their ties to the UK party is that it becomes difficult for them to outflank the SNP on the left on any social democratic issues. 

I don't see the SNP disbanding any time soon. If the vote's close, they'll no doubt re-focus on a vote 2/3 terms down the road. If the vote isn't close, then it gets more interesting. 

Will we ever get a right of centre party that is not the Conservatives? I guess that depends on whether Murdo Fraser is the next leader of the party. The time seems ripe for a split, and there will be no better time to win voters from other parties.

The more energy anyone spends on it the more likely it'll come to the notice of the community or media, and the more likely the investigation is to get branded racist.

It's not about a binary ""investigate/ignore"" choice - it's about *priorities*, and the *degree* of effort they're willing to invest without a solid lead or evidence, and the cost/benefit tradeoff of inviting another PR and community-relations shitstorm when they don't have anything compelling to back it up.

Culture matters, and not all cultures have equal outcomes. But they all do have a considerable amout of agency and are able to shape their own destiny. Blaming all your problems on a scapegoat (aka ""West"") isn't going to solve them!

I was asking how my new insurer can say they don't need to put a claim on my policy while my old insurer says they are putting one on. It's a central database so the 2 are mutually exclusive. As you rightly said, the new insurer you'd expect would class it as a claim but they didn't which is what I didn't understand.

My response was cranky to the other post because it was neither helpful nor insightful. I'm already aware I shouldn't have done it and it was a bad move on my part. That said, in mind of posts being helpful to future readers, the below is what i've found out.

* The obvious first - if you sell your car, yes cancel your insurance immediately.
* Pretty much all insurers opt in to be RTA insurers. (RTA = Road Traffic Act). What this means is that if a car is involved in an accident and said car has an active policy on it, the insurance company that the policy belongs to will be responsible for paying out any claimants - regardless of whether it was you driving or not.
* Now, while they are obligated by law to pay out a claim, they are not obligated to put a fault claim on your policy and this is entirely at their discretion and very much arguable.
* If there is an accident where a car isn't covered by an active insurance policy, this is dealt with by the Motor Insurance Bureau. Essentially, a small part of every insurance premium is put into a central pot to cover accidents where there is no insurance. Think of it as a national insurance for cars.
* If you sell a car privately, although you are not legally required to, you would be well advised to see proof of ID to ensure the details on the V5 form a valid.

My previous insurer have agreed to remove the fault claim from my policy so if anyone ever finds themselves in this situation, argue it.
