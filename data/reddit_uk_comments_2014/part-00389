There are two parts of Bicester; the town and the village. The town is a combination of people/families who will live in there in perpetuity and then the ""outsiders"" who are typically communting (sic) to London, Brum, High Wycombe. It's a small town mentality type of place where you go out every friday/saturday night to get lagered and then end the night watching people fight outside the kebab van, or sample the delights of a curry, chinese chips with curry sauce or sausage and chips. It's very much like groundhog day living there. It's unfortunately well-placed near the M40 to get to lots of places in an hour including airports, hence my 35 years there and... The Village.

The Village was never wanted by the town, but the town council are allegedly corrupt and willing to take back-handers. So while it offers employment for a small percentage of the town, it offers significant traffic issues with the 98% of the population and surrounding villages. It's a chav magnet (not just the chavs that came from Banbury back in the day). The only people from Bicester (town) that go to Bicester village are those that work there.

A while back they tried to introduce a green development near Bicester (another town council job), where you would be charged a premium to enter via car. Clearly someone had been to Colorado for the greenery.

So now they're going to make this a garden town? Leamington Spa is a garden town; Cheltenham is a garden town. Bicester is a wanna-be and will never be.

[Even this old BBC article mentions it.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/scottishhistory/modern/intro_modern2.shtml)

&gt; Glasgow took the brunt of the depression in the 1930s and acquired many negative stereotypes which it is still trying desperately to lose as it maps out its future for the 21st century. During the inter-war years Glasgow was the corpse of an industrial city, devoid of the spirit of industry, with slums and razor gangs becoming the enduring images of the age. These images were perpetuated in the novel No Mean City and countless other literary imitations over the years which focused on Glasgow's 'hard man' character. It was a mentality which became entrenched over the years, but which reflected the economic and social problems which Glasgow was experiencing for much of the century.

[Here is a TIME article which mentions Glasgows bad reputation as having a 'reputation for youth violence'](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2095603,00.html)

I think getting a centre back is more important in January, if Mirallas and Atsu weren't hurt, we'd have a lot more options on the wings (though it looks like Atsu is headed back to Chelsea now, Roberto should've played him more). If that's the case, we should focus on buying a centre back and getting a winger on loan in January.

A centre back seems more important now, because Alcaraz and Distian are shit, Browning isn't there yet (appears to be playing more on the right anyway), and Stones and Jags need a decent back-up. We should get somebody young (20-24) who can partner well with Stones. I have no idea who that is.

My argument would be that Barcelona never tried to play to our weaknesses (I know that sounds silly).


Why at Stamford Bridge, did they attack so high up the pitch? We were setup to defend and counter, and they played right into it.

You'll see countless times now that Mourinho tightens up away from home, and then pushes for the win in the home game, it adds pressure to the home side when it's 0-0, you want to take the initiative at home, Barca never offered us that.

If they had sat back and played tight  then maybe they'd have had a 2-1 lead at the end of the second leg, and wouldn't have had to push 10 men into our half.

They smashed out plan a, which is what we prepared for, and then when they were ahead in the second leg, instead of sitting back or retaining possession deeper (to draw us out), they sat up and continued to play Plan A. Once again, that's what we were setup to play for, we didn't have the creativity on the pitch to take the initiative, because defense and counter was our tactic.

So from a purely tactical overview, Barca thought they were that much better than they could just play the same way and get through, but i think that's arrogant, and clearly the difference between the pragmatic approach of Mourinho, and the stylistic way Pep ALWAYS plays.

They missed clear chances, i agree, and normally they wouldn't, but they also conceded 3 goals, 2 at home, that ""normally"" wouldn't happen either. If i was Pep, i'd be looking at why they conceeded those goals, rather than why Fabregas missed an easy chance.


My final point about defensive football that i really hate, is that people say "" it's easy to sit 9 players in the box"", but when you look at teams like Liverpool who threw a 3-1 lead away at Crystal Palace, you'll see that it takes not only tactical nouse, but a clearly defined pla.

How many times do we score, and then watch Mourinho make defensive subs, 20 minutes go, Mikel, 5 minutes to go Luis or Zouma. I didn't see any of that from Barca, it was balls to the wall, we are the better team, arrogant, and complacent in my eyes.

(*taken from a quote under the article )

This report on the impact of welfare reform on Northern Ireland, was commissioned by the Centre for Economic Empowerment and carried out by Professors Christina Beatty and Steve Fothergill of the Centre for Regional Economic and Social Research (CRESR) at Sheffield Hallam University.

Key points

• When the present welfare reforms have come into full effect they will take £750m a year out of the Northern Ireland economy. This is equivalent to £650 a year for every adult of working age.

• The financial loss to Northern Ireland, per adult of working age, is substantially larger than in any other part of the UK.

• Belfast is hit harder by the reforms than any major city in Britain.

• Derry and Strabane are also hit very hard, and generally across Northern Ireland the most deprived areas face the largest losses.

• The biggest financial losses to Northern Ireland arise from reforms to incapacity benefits (£230m a year), changes to Tax Credits (£135m a year), the 1 per cent up-rating of most working-age benefits (£120m a year) and reforms to Disability Living Allowance (£105m a year).

• The Housing Benefit reforms result in more modest losses – an estimated £20m a year arising from the ‘bedroom tax’ for example – but for the households affected the sums are nevertheless still large.

• By lowering incomes more than elsewhere, a key effect of the welfare reforms will be to widen the gap in prosperity between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.

It's the word ""gay"" that's the issue, let's substitute it for grey and see if that  helps. The FDA state that the prevalence of HIV in grey blood is  60 times greater than non grey and that it has an infection rate 800 times greater than first time blood donors and an 8000 times greater than repeat blood donors.

Tests are not always accurate and there is a window of up to 3 months where infected blood does not test as such because the telltale antibodies that the tests are based on do not show up. Blood is also ""pooled"" or tested in batches of ten so more than one recipient is in danger of infection if the donor contracted HIV during that crucial three month period.

Much of the testing is also based on a questions answer sheet which of course can be falsified and the problem becomes worse in countries who rely on family or purchased blood.

The immense pressure for the lifting of the ban on ""grey"" blood may well be putting lives at risk and is based more on an equal rights agenda than it is on safety and science.

I have my doubts, is that due to me being a bigoted homophobe?
Naa if I or my children needed blood I dont care where the blood comes from and I'd shake the hand and thank any gay man who was altruistic enough to give blood, I just want it to be safe.

I think this is a bigger factor than we think.

I am a big believer in mental toughness and psychology being the key for great players. Anyone getting regular time in the first team is a great footballer (compared to the average person) and they have always been the best as they grew up. However, the difference between becoming a *professional* and just a great footballer is huge, I think. Maturity, understanding the business, and still playing at a high level for a business like a football club is important to sustained success in any professional league.

So, I guess what I'm getting to is that even though Brad Jones may not have the raw skills of Mignolet, the fact that Jones can offer a slight bit of comfort for his defenders could go a long way.

Not to say that Mignolet's teammates don't like Mignolet or thinks that he is an awful keeper, but I do think that they want Mignolet to succeed and thus an extra sense of pressure to do something extra (or even extra-ordinary) to help him out. A lot of times that creates some critical mistakes.

Jones isn't necessarily the long-term answer but maybe his ""I don't give a fuck; I'm just a backup 'keeper and I have nothing to lose"" attitude really gives a club a boost in the short-term (and indirectly helps Mignolet get back to where he needs to be).",0,1419415979,null,0,false,0,cn43yle,t3_2q87ki,t1_cn43yle,t1_cn43vwm,null,1425238567,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Costa, Fabregas, Hazard, Oscar etc for Chelsea, Aguero, Dzeko, Silva, Toure for City, Falcao, RVP, Rooney, Mata, di Maria for Man U. Even Arsenal have Sanchez. At this moment in time I wouldn't say any players have *that* kind of factor going forward so far. But nobody predicting a Spurs win is a bit strange. However....

&gt;I could save a lot of time here and just say Tottenham will nick a 2-1 win in the last minute. 

And they rightly point out that they need a win terribly.  Stranger things have happened. Last year for example Sunderland went on one hell of a streak, lost a load of games and only got a couple of points from 9 or 10 I think. Bottom of the table by a lot (7 or 8 points iirc) then they drew with City, then won 4 including  beating Chelsea and United and survived the relegation battle. It's football, anything can happen. Would you have predicted them to draw with the champions and beat Chelsea after that run? I wouldn't've, would've said a certain win for both and relegation for Sunderland. Rambling about players below, don't waste your time but I typed it out so I'll keep it.

Chadli, Eriksen and Kane this year are probably the biggest threats on average, none yet are at that level. Chadli's improvement this year has been drastic and if he keeps playing well and improving at this rate could possibly be the biggest threat imo - he can score quite a few - could be 15+ this year which is mental, excluding Bale haven't had that from a winger/wide player since.... well a long time - he can get half a yard and cross, can beat a man, can come inside, can make intelligent runs through (was it Besiktas his goal was ruled but wasn't actually offside?), has good feet, is a bit faster than average, is built, can finish very well..... Yeah he could be very good. Eriksen, aside from being less built is the more ""intelligent"" of the players in the side, has a beautiful final ball, can strike (which he needs to do more of), again a good bit of pace.

Lamela I'm not including in that list atm because he needs to consistently play well over a longer period of tim, like the others have done this year.

My speculation is this...

* While FSG are rich enough to provide enough resources for a large club, they're not necessarily as rich as, say, Chelsea or Man City.
* FSG are self-aware enough to realize that we're not ready to grab a Champions League spot consistently.
* So, you invest in younger players who may be more willing to stay with a club for the long-run, rather than players in their prime who may want to leave because we're not quite ready for consistent Champions League play.

It's an unfortunate situation. I look at Luis Suarez and I want to say, *you* could have not only been the Man who leads us to the Champions League but also success in the Champions League. But it's hard to change *perception*. Suarez is in the prime of his career and being the great footballer that he is, realises that his window is closing quickly and he wants to win *now*. Hence, Barca.

However, younger players? You can convince them to stick around longer. They're not as willing to jump ship to, say, Spain to start a new life in an unfamiliar location.

That is sort of the in-between-a-rock-and-a-hard-place situation that we're in.

The NHS will flatline (people have been happy to mention immigrants are a strain on the system but forget most people on the front line doing the hard graft are immigrants)

Lots of people will leave right? But what people don't realise (or do depending on what argument anti immigration people are going for). Is that most immigrants work, so what will happen is they will all leave and the governments PAYE income will plummet. 

 this is because contrary to popular belief, most 'poor' immigrants work but still live on the breadline whilst most poor natives don't; pop out a couple of kids and just live on the dole for the rest of their lives.

Then there's the skilled workers, there was a huge influx of 'natives' (my self included) going to university to get a better skill set. But the Tories put a stop to most people being able to reasonably afford that. So what will happen is, people come in to fill that void.

And if companies can't get skilled workers then they either go bust or move, you can't hire someone with no skills to become a doctor or a software engineer.

My point is, people are looking for someone to blame during these hard times, I think people just need to use their noggin and think things through. I personally want what's best for Britain, not what's best for 'the natives' and pulling out of EU free movement is not up there as a smart thing to do. Tightening what resource people have access to until they've contributed to the system is. 

But then I think that should happen to people REGARDLESS of whether they were born here.

So would I, against sides that play a bit of football (leaving quite a bit of space) but can't reliably finish is a great matchup and we've won a good number. Newcastle, Everton, Swansea being the recent ones. They've had problems scoring although you can almost guarantee that means they'll score haha.

I'd agree with that too.

In the same way that everyone lately shits on Mason despite us playing better with him in the team, so too do we play better with Lennon in the team, across his entire career with us.

Players like Lennon and Mason and Kane and Walker give us space to work in by virtue of selfless work off the ball and constant sacrificed runs. Lennon and Walker also provide width, stretching the game in the middle and giving space for others to work in.

Even when Lennon has a bad game, these are still evident. It might not be flashy, but it improves the team, and it is my opinion that we see too quick to criticise individual errors in the context of attributes that significantly improve the team performance.

I would rather have Lloris sent off every fifth game but have him stop the through balls and balls over the top being played. I'd rather have Kaboul help maintain a sometimes quasi-suicidally high line that takes the strain off the midfield than watch Fazio punch people in the face in slow motion in the six yard box. It's about the way that the players can influence the system and the way we play. It's about how we play, and what the outcomes are, not how much each individual is seen to be doing.

We are almost always better with Lennon, regardless of whether he gets on the ball at all, and that is BECAUSE of Lennon.",0,1419419280,null,0,false,0,cn44km0,t3_2q7ap3,t1_cn44km0,t1_cn3ptsr,null,1425238283,6,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,6

Depending on the kind of work discussed (skilled vs. unskilled) it ought to be possible to fill the void of unskilled immigrant labour with unskilled native labourers. 

With regards to skilled work, there are skilled software engineers - for instance - but there are many who claim to be skilled but actually are diabolical by UK standards. Don't automatically assume that being a foreign software engineer makes you a capable one (any more than being a native software engineer makes you a capable one). I've lost count of the number of interviews we've had for non-native software engineers who've received very poor feedback on their technical ability. 

I'm pretty sure there was an article relatively recently posted on here (last couple of months) that indicated that EU immigrants were a benefit to the country, non-EU immigrants tended to be more of a drain. It might be worth looking that up as well. 

Lastly - before writing off non-working British completely - consider how much opportunity they necessarily have for advancement in their own situations. That's not to say everyone is aching to work hard (there are no doubt lazy and unmotivated people just as there are motivated ones) - but if you're born in to council estates, poverty and poor education then you're going to be afforded fewer opportunities to get out of it. 

In closing - writing off British workers as unsuitable for replacing immigrant ones does not look at the whole issue and will only continue to perpetuate a shackled British underclass who have little hope of employment or advancement. That's not to say immigrants are directly to blame - but saying British people are lazy vs. immigrants may also be an unfair conclusion.

I'm pretty sure it was. I think the overdose risk would be high if it was mostly opium and heroin.

The thing you want to look at is what's called the active/lethal dose ratio.

http://smg.photobucket.com/user/matt06/media/Drugs.jpg.html

If you take 1 unit of a drug for a therapeutic result, then X units of the drug will kill you.

For marijuana and LSD, the ratio is about 1000. You need to overdose by 1000 for it to kill you.

Alcohol is 10x. e.g. you can drink 5 shots of vodka, but 50 shots will most likely kill you.

Heroin approaches 5x.  

So, let's say you want to smoke some heroin, and you need a lungful of heroin for a ""dose"". Then 5 lungfuls can potentially kill you. Also consider that long term users of heroin build up a tolerance. if you've never taken heroin before, you won't need nearly as much.

I wouldn't stand anywhere near a bonfire of heroin. Even if you don't overdose, you can pass out, vomit and choke.

Do you remember the [Moscow Theatre hostage crisis?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_theater_hostage_crisis#The_chemical_agent_mystery). They suspect they used an opioid gas to subdue everyone in the building. I'm not saying that burning heroin is the same or as powerful as this synthetic gas, but you can see the effects that such a gas can have.

Welfare reform? Too right we need it, the country isn't exporting, it's not creating wealth, it's eating itself from the inside out with a massive welfare state that's grown far larger than originally designed.

Half the current countries leadership for the past 30 years actively encouraged it's supporters to bleed the States coffers dry, now they've reaped what they've sown, a country addicted to state jobs and Benifits.

In fairness, though by no means is it just our guys, Westminster and the western world by and large have allowed corporations to export our entire manufacturing capacity to the Far East where goods are produced for buttons by people who work for buttons under communist regimes and worse. THAT is the real crime, who would have thought when China was rolling tanks over its own people for wanting even a smidgeon of the freedom that we take for granted that our leaders would be supporting that regime by exporting our manufacturing to there?

BUT that all said and moaned about there's only one way to fix it, get of our arses and work. Ween the people of the welfare addiction by giving them the opportunity to work for a better life.

Look at 'keepers like de Gea. He was ridiculed in his early days of being a regular starter but he seems to have developed into a great 'keeper and pegged as the successor to Casillas.

Why not Mignolet?

However... considering our current situation, there may not be enough time for Mignolet to develop to his full potential.

Also interesting is that about 3 or 4 years ago FSG assembled basically a dream team of established players for the Red Sox and it was an unmitigated disaster. One of the top two guys spent much of the season injured, the other forgot how to hit a ball, the manager was terrible and it all culminated in a scandal when the pitching staff were found to have been drinking beer and eating fried chicken in the clubhouse during games. 

FSG retooled with a manager with less baggage and solid but not as ""world class""-type players and won the World Series 2 years later. I've been wondering for a while now if Liverpool's focus on raw/youth players has been driven by FSG's success in pursuing a similar model with the Red Sox.

&gt;“Doing porridge” is what inmates in UK prisons call serving time. It’s slang for the bowls of gloopy, boiled oats that were once ladled out every morning at lockups across the country. But the saying has taken on a whole new meaning following the launch of open-to-the-public restaurants inside select British prisons, where convicts work as chefs and kitchen assistants, cooking Michelin-style cuisine.

&gt;The brainchild of The Clink Charity, set up to reduce reoffending rates of ex-offenders by training and placing graduates into employment upon their release, three prison restaurants now operate in the UK. The newest is The Clink in south London’s Brixton neighbourhood, opened February 2014. You can find it beyond the menacingly thick-steel doors of Her Majesty’s Prison: a mesh of barbed wire, patrolling guards, sniffer dogs and security cameras. Given that dining at the jail requires an in-depth security briefing before a reservation is confirmed, visiting can be, well, complicated.

&gt;...

&gt;The statistics don’t lie. Following the success of the first two Clink restaurants – one located at High Down in Surrey, and Clink Cymru at HMP Cardiff in Wales – reoffending rates have plummeted. Currently 49% of ex-convicts in the UK reoffend within one year of release; for those who serve sentences under 12 months this increases to 61%. But in 2011, the reoffending rate of graduates from The Clink was only 12.5%.

There are few things more painful then watching your heroes grow old and weak. There are few things more heartbreaking than watching your parents suddenly become old and weak.

It's sobering to see Steven Gerrard at 34-years-old (still quite young in human terms but not in footballing terms) lose a step to youngsters who couldn't possibly have any idea what Gerrard meant to the game. (It's also the understandable reason why some footballers are about the money but that's a discussion for another time).

Steven Gerrard is an aging legend but who is going to be the one to tell him that? Who is going to be the one that tells Gerrard, 'Mate, you're the player you once was, it's time to take a step back.'

Who is going to be the one in your family that says, 'Dad, you've lost a step, you've got to give up the only job you've ever known.'

Brutal.

For legends like Gerrard, I believe that the club has the responsibility to almost save the player from himself. To truly honor and respect a legend, you have to gradually create an exit plan that allows a legend to enter the sunset of his career in the most graceful way possible.

My hope is that the club will see this and work even harder to develop a squad that is so amazing that Gerrard doesn't feel as if he needs to be the Man anymore. And then gradually bow out of regular playing time while still being able to pop in for some bursts of magic. I think that is one of the best ways to show true respect for a legend as opposed to forcing an old race horse to the brink.

Hopefully we will see that soon.",0,1419422087,null,0,false,0,cn4535y,t3_2q9qmc,t1_cn4535y,t3_2q9qmc,null,1425238042,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9

While I was extremely disappointed in the departure of Suarez, I cannot necessarily blame him.

It's easy to look at a player and criticise him for lacking loyalty for a club. But supporters and ownership are rarely criticised for making the ruthless moves to abandon or move a player who has seemingly 'lost it.'

As for the Red Sox example, I think that is an interesting case.

Sometimes a club like Manchester United, Chelsea, Manchester City, Yankees, Lakers, etc. can simply play fantasy sports and create a team of superstars and established players and go on to succeed and win titles.

However, it's not always that way. There's more to sport than simply gathering superstars together like a fantasy team.

There are so many intangibles and team chemistry is one of them. And often times it's that team chemistry that can take a group of lesser individuals and turn them into a *team*.

59.3% christian - 33.2 million people

25% no religion - 14.1 million people

7% not stated 

4.8% Muslim - 2.7 million people

4% Other 

From 2001 census the number of people identifying themselves as Muslim grew from 3.0% to 4.8% (1.8%).

The number of people identifying themselves as No region grew from 14.8% to 25.1% (10.3%), the drop of Christianity was from 71.7% to 59.3%(12.4%).

The claim that it could become the UK dominate religion in just 10 years seems pretty baseless. However I'm not looking at the all the data as I just don't know it nor how to process it properly. Taking into account ages and birth rate yes It might be possible but I highly doubt it would occur in 10 years, maybe 40+ years.

There is a problem with the term ""Dominate religion"" as it doesn't include non belief when comparing the data (not that it can nor really should). 

The news piece never mentions once the size of non religions people, and that the growth in Muslim is tiny compared to the growth of Non belief.

Data is lovely, just don't cherry pick it.

I would expect the percentage of the British population calling themselves Muslim will continue to rise until it balances the rest of the planet at around the 23% mark, although as Atheism grows more quickly, we could find that percentage shrinking worldwide as well.

No it won't. With a controlled immigration policy we can bring in people as and when required.

&gt; Lots of people will leave right?

No, why would they?

&gt; But the Tories put a stop to most people being able to reasonably afford that. So what will happen is, people come in to fill that void.

University is actually more affordable now than under Labour. There is absolutely no reason financially not to go to university.

&gt; And if companies can't get skilled workers then they either go bust or move, you can't hire someone with no skills to become a doctor or a software engineer.

This is a follow On point to above but its still moot anyway because of my first point. They can bring in workers as and when required under a controlled immigration system. The workers just have to prove they're needed. That's all.

&gt; Like being born here gives you the right to be a drain on the system

While I don't disagree that we should tighten benefits more across the board, the idea on tightening on immigrants especially is pretty fair in my eyes. Because the likelihood is is that a native has at some point contributed to the system, or their parents have. Whereas a newly-migrated immigrant has not.

I don't really remember anyone bitching too hard in the summer about how Migs was definitely not going to be good enough for us as a goalkeeper. We knew he wasn't amazing but can't really recall many goalkeepers being top of the list of must-have players over the summer.

&gt; no natural defensive mid

Likewise. There was a *lot* of complaining last January and then we went to win 11 games in a row with Gerrard in a holding midfield role and people didn't see it as a huge issue (and we signed Can).

&gt; no defensive coach

Yeah tbh, can't argue with this one. Our defence has only gotten worse and worse since Rafa left. 

&gt; no real replacement for suarez

We could have signed one, but that would have been £60m+ not spent on the likes of Moreno, Lallana and Markovic (assuming we could even persuade someone to come) and we'd have the exact same issue we had last season: zero depth, our only options from the bench were the likes of Cissokho and Moses, and we had no contingency for injuries. Our squad is struggling without a key striker at the moment, but could you imagine how fucked we'd be if our only signing in the summer was Falcao or Aguero with the amount of time they've spent off the pitch injured or unfit? We'd be stuck with Borini up front almost every game and hoping that Sterling/Coutinho/Henderson are OK to play every game all season without burning out or getting injured. 

Whether we bought the right players is a different issue (personally I think Lallana and Lovren were overpriced, and Balotelli hasn't been used as well as he could have been) but I'm still pretty confident that it was the better decision in the long-run to spend most of our transfer money bulking up the squad rather than keeping ourselves stuck to being a one or two-man team. You can't win anything with a great first XI if everyone else in the squad is useless. 

Like fair enough to your point that if this was raised last season it should have been dealt with over the summer, but a lot of the things you've said either weren't seen as big issues or at the very least weren't considered a priority. Is easy with hindsight to point out exactly what we maybe *should* have done, but the club didn't have that hindsight at the time.",0,1419426634,null,0,1419432589,0,cn4610n,t3_2q9qtn,t1_cn4610n,t1_cn44qrk,null,1425237603,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

3, Because blood is often pooled and tested in batches of ten the risk of multiple infections due to the undetectable window is high.

Therefore.....blood from gay men DOES carry an increased risk.

Why should the presentation of thee facts be treated as homophobic?

It doesn't mean gays are dirty, sick or morally less equal than anybody else, it just means that those factors constitute a higher risk to those recieving the blood and this should be rightly considered when setting procedures.

I've already said I'd be very grateful for anyone's blood if I needed it so I can hardly be advocating predjudice here.

The gay lobby does IMV need to grow up, it's a big boy now and homosexuality is by and large accepted in society so they should be grown up about risks and not simply adopt a poor me I'm persecuted attitude every time anybody raises a question that relates to homosexuality.

Why form any (formal) coalition? Many of the Tories and Lib Dems' current difficulties, in opinion polls, possibly including UKIP's rise, could come from the Coalition agreement's provisions from May 2010. 

If no Coalition, Cameron would have received a bit more latitude operating on his own, Labour would have stuck with Brown for a bit so they weren't caught leaderless at a snap poll (Brown's resignation was a condition of Clegg's), and the right of the Conservative Party may not have ditched their party for UKIP out of frustration for concessions (real and perceived) to Clegg. Clegg never gets slammed for supporting a Tory government with Thatcherite policies.

Ed Miliband would be extremely foolish to repeat Cameron's mistake. And the LibDems aren't necessarily moderate or moderating. Many are unhappy ex-Labour (which are going back to Labour or to the Greens). Some are true liberals (Clegg). The only moderates in the LDs are people like Baroness Williams, who think whatever the truth is that lies between Labour and Tory manifestos are the source from which all policy should be derived. And I think the electorate would prefer the largest party to attempt to go-it-alone, governing on a bill-by-bill basis for a bit.

I see people on reddit with a real hatred for overweight people, and they always blame them as if they consciously made themselves overweight. Personally I don't see any difference between obesity and other addictions, sugar is a drug and it's addictive as fuck. We don't blame people for being drug addicts, so I don't think it should be any different with obesity.

I wish people would direct their anger onto the corporations and their advertising &amp; product branding that continues to trick consumers into thinking they're eating healthily, or onto the government for not doing anything about it. 

Consumers are purposely kept ignorant as to what's actually healthy, just look at the sales of 'low fat' foods that contain huge amounts of sugar. People are also tricked into thinking they can eat this junk food and lose weight if they go to the gym, which just isn't true, you can't lose weight when you eat this shit regularly.

Just isolate yourself from anything that's going to distract you. It sounds stupid and annoying, but it works so well. I have my computer on when I revise, and even I get distracted a bit, or I might get a message from someone on my phone ~~though this rarely happens because no one wants to talk to me~~. 

For me, the main thing that drives me to revise is the fact that I want everyone to look at me and think ""fuck. This guy's good."" It sounds a bit *up myself*, but honestly, I love it when people think that of me at school because that just makes me even more motivated. 

I thought of GCSEs as a game, and I wanted to win. You need to get it into your mind that you'll **never** get anything if you don't want it, so do anything to ensure you do get it. Like I said, for me it was imagining my GCSE year was a game. I'm an extremely competitive person, so this worked perfectly for me - and that's what I'm doing with my A levels. 

All in all, it doesn't matter how you do it. You can ask 1,000 people how they revise, but it might just be one person's method that will work for you. I can browse Reddit for 10 minutes every an hour and get back to revision, or go and make myself a cuppa. It works for me, and I have good concentration, but that doesn't mean that everyone does it. 

Feel free to PM me. I'm here to help!

Christianity is the backbone of *some* local communities, and it is at the heart of our national life because this is a *Christian* country.  You have Christian saints days, you celebrate Christmas and Easter, the Monarch is the Supreme Governor of the Church of England, etc.

59% of people identify as Christian, 25% as non-religious. I'm sure a large part of that 25% still celebrate the Christian holidays and festivals. They probably also celebrate Diwali and support their friends during the Ramadan fast.

While it could have been phrased better, his statement couldn't possibly encompass every other faith and celebration and it doesn't necessarily exclude those who aren't Christian.

I'm an Atheist, and I'm still celebrating Christmas this year. I'm taking part in a Christian faith festival *as it stands today*. I understand that Christmas is derived from other festivals, but I'm doing the Christian one because that's what most people do.

The young ones who have come in this past summer are struggling to acclimate already: Moreno is touch and go, Can is touch and go, Markovic was in very bad form until recently, Manquillo touch and go as well.  It takes time to get properly set in, and many of these guys had a preseason to help them out yet still they struggle.

I guarantee the weight on Origi's shoulders will be far greater if he comes in January than if he comes in the summer.  He'll definitely fit into how we play very, very well, but so do many of the other youngsters we've bought and they're having a hard time.  You bring a striker into a misfiring squad that's struggling for goals and I guarantee the overwhelming expectations is for that striker to solve the goal scoring problem.  Origi won't do that, he's not even very clinical at this point in his development.

The guy is going to be amazing for us, but the time for him is not now.  We can be patient with him, and I think we need to be.  It's better for everyone involved.

1. Like you rightly said, we got a lot of link up play between defence and attack, something that was missing. Markovic and Henderson saw a lot of the ball and they played really well with their runs up&amp;down and their pressing. Not sure if the success is down to Lucas and Gerrard's partnership working well though.

2. Element of surprise: I believe that neither Arsenal or Bournemouth adapted to our system well and may have been surprised to an extent with the formation. I dont know how long we can continue making subtle variations to our tactics to affect the game. For starters, I think BR has done well to come up with an interesting solution to our problems with the resources we have. And the opposition will have to plan for us and we may do very well leading up to Sturridge's return.

We seem to have fixed issues in Attack, but our Defense leaves a lot to be desired. We may be stretched a lot at the back and may see a lot of 'Giroud-ish' goals with this system - the ball pulled back for a header/finish in the box. An issue persistent with playing 3 at the back. Time will tell. Also interesting to note that BR keeps referring to 'Individual' mistakes in defence where CBs dont clear the ball from the box. It has been going on for a while (since Carra), and I dont know what BR is doing to resolve that..

Companies target children from early ages, plying them with advertising for takeaways and junk food. We have nowhere near enough regulation on the shit these companies specifically target towards kids.

People get tricked into focusing on buzzwords like 'low-fat' when they're trying to eat healthy, there's a systematic campaign by food companies to make unhealthy food appear healthy. 

The problem here is food companies and the lack of government regulation, this is the thing we should be fighting, not focusing on the individuals.

I just put it down to being torn up being played on a rainy day.

Will be interesting to see if the club goes with a more advanced artificial pitch, or go back to a more natural composition which is always harder to maintain in Liverpool.

I'm yet to see this policy thats tough on immigration yet somehow brings in staff to the NHS, they are already understaffed so it kind of goes hand in hand that cutting off one of the main employment pipelines will make that worse.

&gt;University is actually more affordable now than under Labour. There is absolutely no reason financially not to go to university.

I was under the assumption that £9000.00 a year tuition fees would be a pretty good deterrent, five years ago that sort of money would see you through three years of University. You'll have to explain to me how -as a student- spending more money is more affordable then spending less.

&gt;This is a follow On point to above but its still moot anyway because of my first point. They can bring in workers as and when required under a controlled immigration system. The workers just have to prove they're needed. That's all.

I'd like to point out that I stated tighter immigration controls like a system similar to Australia would be beneficial.

That said, cutting immigration would leave a shortfall in workers, regardless of whether it was completely closing the borders or only letting in a select few. This would be beneficial **if** we already have people here that can do those jobs. 

I know you think that university is affordable, but I'm going to go ahead and say that most potential uni students are going to agree with me in saying that its not. So I go back to original point on that, in that we don't have the skilled work force to cover such an event. Again I've seen no party policies that state they want a skills assessed immigration policy. So far all I've heard is ""lower the cap"", ""pull out of the free movement agreement"" basically knee jerk reaction policies to reel in the voters.

Its a shame immigration is top of the agender for the up coming election. I could think of much more important things that need our attention then that.

We've been linked with the likes of Perrin from Genoa, but he seems like a risk since he's so young and a bit raw for a keeper.  Lots of hype around him as the heir to Buffon though, so maybe it's worth the chance?  I don't know much about the player so I don't really have an opinion.

I don't think a forward of the quality we need is going to be available to us at all, let alone for the peanuts we have to spend on him (especially if we buy a keeper as well).

No it isn't. The actual cost of being at uni for the student has stayed the same. The amount of debt said student is saddled with after graduation has trebled. You can make roundabout claims of the salary threshold being a bit higher for different rates of payback, but the fact remains that if you're getting a decently paid job then you're going to be paying a lot more for your degree under the Conservative's student loans system (the kind of job you want to get as a graduate. I wouldn't describe the payment threshold as particularly high be honest, I could have earned more money with a trade instead of a degree).

[What you talking about Willis?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Care_in_the_Community) It's been a continuing exercise as the cost of welfare and healthcare has grown. Community care is a cost saving exercise. They do a lot of it in Japan for the elderly because there's no good way of shipping lots of ill and immobile people to hospital and back on a regular basis. I don't know about the quality of patient outcomes for this approach but I'd imagine it's a lot less invasive for the people involved, the important part is being able to access the appropriate treatments which is precisely what is wrong with the proposed approach.

What these changes will do, as perfectly outlined in the article, is reduce the rate of treatment and in turn some conditions will progress to becoming untreatable. This is not going to improve outcomes for patient care.

The fundamental reasons they buy young is firstly they want to buy cheap and secondly they plan to make a profit from them later, not that ""they're not as willing to jump ship"". Young players and established players are no different in the royalty department once there is a possible better offer elsewhere, look at Sterling.

The policy failed because in execution they actually couldn't get the quality that the team is needed and the money was also not cheap either. Some guys here argue that they will pay off in long term. That's very unlikely, because when you are not qualified for the regular playing time, you won't be able to improve quickly. The are always new players coming in, the competition within is so heated, if you can't make it in one season, there is far less chance you will ever make it, even if you are not that bad, look at Alberto and Suso.

And then in your last post you said the way the law is that you would drive stoned because of the law being unfair. And I think that is fucking stupid. Whether the law is right or wrong, and I agree using these tests are wrong, to respond to that by saying 'well fine I'm just gonna drive stoned off my face then' is just stupid as you'll put innocent people in danger.

I'm hugely in favour of the public sector running *(most)* core services and the private sector has a pretty bad track record for biasing profit over everything.  Obviously it's fun to blame everything on private sector greed, but the public sector wouldn't have done any better on this.

The public sector is under-resourced, under-funded and riddled with bad management.  None of these are going to get any better any time soon, if ever.

There's another thing that's not always particularly clear from outside it:  The public sector has an terrible incentive model which promotes risk aversion.  There's rarely, if ever, a reward for high performance and deviation from process isn't tolerated.

If anything, the, ""We followed the process."" thinking which leads to a guy trying to rebuild his life being thrown back into the prison system because some paperwork wasn't signed off is more common in the public sector than the private sector.

Operators in India are also given a much more strict script or are just used to slow down operations to give UK operators more time to respond.


Source: Worked in a call centre when I was younger for a large retailer, very commonly got told by supervisors to just re-direct customers to India and tell the other operator to just keep them occupied until I could get back to them when lines were busy. I feel sorry for the Indian call centre workers, normal customer service people get a lot of abuse from angry customers but those guys just get a whole other level of heavily racist abuse from customers, like some real deeply nasty stuff, its one of the reason companies tell them to give fake english names out.",0,1419448681,null,0,1419449396,0,cn4f7gq,t3_2qadoh,t1_cn4f7gq,t1_cn4bibu,null,1425233148,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

http://www.reddit.com/r/BritishPolitics/comments/2j3m7x/uk_government_to_sell_eurostar_stake_before/cl8e085

&gt;Sure, though I'd better keep it fairly short.

&gt;I'm a socialist, which probably speaks volumes about my thoughts regarding globalisation. My dad was a union leader for many years back in the 70s and got the big shaft from the Tory govt in the 80s. When I got into politics it was very much as an anti-Thatcher / Major / Tory generally, and like many others crowed mightily when Blair got in, though things changed pretty quickly when the direction of his 3rd way became clear.

&gt;Privatisation was just the beginning: I worked with a lot of people who had come from the mines, the car factories, BT, you name it. There was such bitterness and anger, even hatred towards the Tory government, and then to see Blair continue the trend... It was a bit of a wake up call for me. Then of course the second Iraq war, Enron and Bush's cabinet. They weren't even bothering to hide their motives by this point.

&gt;I left the Labour party, joined the Lib Dems for a bit, then they sacked Charles Kennedy, appointed Ming over Hughes (the latter may not have been a bad thing with hindsight) and demoted a lot of other MPs that professed to ""alternative"" lifestyles. In a hissy fit I joined the Greens, read Lucas' book (Green Alternatives to Globalisation) which was admittedly full of daft ideas but got me reading about other stuff. Basically I got turned further and further away from globalisation, and I was never a fan to begin with.

&gt;What drives me politically speaking is the idea of a fair society, with publicly owned services and private companies that pay their fair share. If Tescos and Vodaphone buggered off elsewhere because they refuse to pay their taxes then that opens the door for smaller businesses with different ideas. To have MPs or lords who answer to bodies other than the general public is not democratic, it's not good for society in general and is a clear conflict of interest.

&gt;The theory of globalisation may be sound, but in practise it means that a politician can act according to the organisation that is most likely to offer him or her the most benefits. To see John Major join the Carlyle group after leaving office makes me question his motives while PM. To see Cameron and Blair acting as arms dealers while in office leaves a particularly bitter taste in the mouth. And to see Blunkett campaign for ID cards provided for by the company whose board he sat on... Well, all these things are done pretty much in the name of globalisation. Those of us who decry it are seen as hindering progress, or unpatriotic, or some kind of loony. Yet I subscribe to the view that being pro-globalisation basically gives someone a license to be a crook. Not everyone is a crook, of course, but there are plenty that make Richard Nixon look pretty fucking saintly.

&gt;Finally, globalisation (I believe) makes it all too easy for big business to exploit their workers. I don't think that Nike, Apple, Nokia, whoever, would find it quite so easy to set up sweatshops in Bangladesh and then snigger quietly when the factory collapses if the world wasn't so pro-globalisation. By limiting the power of a corporation and ensuring better regulation the lives of the workers and their families could be significantly improved. Even if it's just basic healthcare or a better wage. But no, globalisation allows Big Business to do pretty much what they want outside of the US and Europe.

The whole thing got sprung on short notice and I cancelled all of my planned vacations at the time to go. I think something like over 100 official supporters clubs applied to get in, but only 36 were chosen. Talking with the staff, the club rents out the pitch for two weeks after the end of each season for corporate events. Been to Anfield many times and toured the grounds before, but went with the team and saw that some company paid for an 11v11 event that included Alan Kennedy on the pitch with them.

There were three groups that day and LFCNY was in the last group. You got to have a few group matches and then a penalty shootout with a team that counted towards your points total. I ended up scoring my peno and saving the last one to win the group. Didn't have any expectations on the day, but we ended up winning the lot. 

Back to the topic of the thread, the pitch really did a number on my condition. My body was just crushed the next day. My lower back was pulled, my knees had pitch burns all over them, and my hips had deep bruises. Tried to play in my local league the next week. Went for the first dive in warm-ups and I just felt this massive joint of pain from my hips that rocked my body. Decided to pack it in shortly after. After that Anfield experience, I don't think anything will ever come close to the emotions of an impossible dream that day. I still have a hard time believing it actually happened.

The Christians run them as part of their service to God. Yes, as a Christian I think that people are prone to sin and without encouragement from other believers, many people would decide to stay at home and watch their Strictly boxset instead. It's been [very well established by social scientists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_Alone) that community has declined in recent decades in the West; it's a matter of fierce controversy whether this is a cause or consequence of the decline in Christian commitment.

""They are **only** doing it for religious reasons.""

You're assuming that religious reasons are inherently inferior to some other (unspecified) reasons. I think that's an unjustified assumption.

""Go down to your local food bank....""

The one nearest to here is entirely run by church members, so it's evens on anecdotes. You've presumably seen /u/iheardyoulikecheese's statistical evidence that churches run three-quarters of food banks. I'm not aware of any foodbanks run by overtly Marxist or Liberal affiliated groups (do enlighten me) and I'm certain none are run by Strictly fans! Churches have built community in a way that none of the others worldviews mentioned have.

So I'm not convinced by your argument that celebrity TV shows build community in a way that is comparable to churches.

&gt;__Tigernmas__,  son of Follach, son of [Ethriel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethriel), a descendant of [Érimón](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89rim%C3%B3n), was, according to medieval Irish legend and historical traditions, an early [High King of Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_King_of_Ireland). His name means either ""Lord of Death"" or ""Beautiful Lord"" in [Old Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Irish). 

&gt;According to the *[Lebor Gabála Érenn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebor_Gab%C3%A1la_%C3%89renn)* he became king when he overthrew his predecessor [Conmáel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conm%C3%A1el) in the Battle of [Óenach Macha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navan_Fort), and within a year of his accession had won twenty-seven battles against the descendants of [Eber Finn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eber_Finn), almost completely destroying Eber's line. It is said that during his reign gold was first smelted in Ireland, by the wright Iuchadán. Tigernmas was the first king to give drinking-horns to his followers, and the first to have clothes dyed purple, blue and green and decorated with brooches, fringes and ornaments. Seven lakes and three rivers burst from the ground during his reign. After reigning for seventy-seven years (or 100 years according to the Book of Fenagh, P 23), he and three-quarters of the men of Ireland died on [Magh Slécht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magh_Sl%C3%A9cht) while worshipping [Crom Cruach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crom_Cruach), a cruel deity propitiated with human sacrifice.   According to the *[Annals of the Four Masters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annals_of_the_Four_Masters)*, Ireland was without a High King for seven years after his death, before [Eochaid Étgudach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eochaid_%C3%89tgudach) took the kingship. 

&gt;The *Lebor Gabála* synchronises his reign with the deaths of Thineas and Decylas, kings of [Assyria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyria), and the reigns of [David](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David) and [Solomon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon) in [Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Israel_(united_monarchy\));  the *Laud Synchronisms* with the [Judean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judea) kings [Asa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asa_of_Judah) and [Jehoshaphat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehoshaphat) and the Assyrian king Pertiades (Pyriatides).  The *[Annals of the Four Masters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annals_of_the_Four_Masters)* dates his reign to 1621–1544 BC;  [Geoffrey Keating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Keating) to 1209–1159 BC.

These are all full-cast audio dramas. The Dalek Empire stories are all 1 hour each (4 in series 1, 4 in series 2, 6 in series 3) and the Lost Stories are 1 1/2 hours each.

Dalek Empire - These don't have the Doctor in, but are about the Daleks trying to conquer the galaxy and various people trying to stop them. They are good fun, and David Tennant is in series 3 in a pre-Doctor Who role.

Lost Stories - These are adaptions of stories that weren't made during the original tv run, but were considered. Most are from the abandoned original season 23, so were very close to being on television until the show got put on hiatus for a year and the production team were ordered to scrap all scripts and start again with a 'new direction'.

Some are really really good and it is a crime they didn't get made. Highlights are Leviathan, Paradise 5 and Point of Entry. The Nightmare Fair is the return of the Celestial Toymaker. Some of them are so terrible they become good (like The Hollows of Time, written by the same guy who did the classics Logopolis, Castrovalva and Frontois).",0,1419453275,null,0,false,0,cn4hb5t,t3_2qatu7,t1_cn4hb5t,t3_2qatu7,null,1425232131,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

Add milk. My preference is to just cover the bottom layer of weetabix, though if I'm having 4 or more then obviously more milk is required. Milk should be poured onto the top layer, not down the side.

Now either: Cover the top layer in sugar (one spoon is plenty to achieve this); or add a spoon of chocolate spread; or drizzle honey over the top layer; or take any sweet preserve you have lying around (lemon curd counts, as does jam. I haven't tried marmalade, but I might tomorrow) and add a spoon of that.

false,seemylolface,lfc12,,"You think Lucas is terrible? Seriously?  Do we watch the same player?  When Gerrard plays the same position Lucas has been playing we get ripped apart through the middle and he's certainly not a terrible player... Lucas shows that a disciplined and intelligent defensive midfielder makes a big difference in anchoring the center of the pitch and protecting the defense in transitions, not just any player.

He's a very positionally intelligent player who  covers for his midfield extremely well, wins the ball, and gets us going.  He has been superb at covering the midfield, specifically Gerrard when he wanders off, in the past few games.  If you put any other player on our team in there with Gerrard it would be hell on earth for our defense.

If you play Lucas/Gerrard in a setup where they're the main combatants in midfield (like the 4-2-3-1) then they'll get run over because neither one is particularly mobile.  But if you include a third man (which the 3-4-3 does because Lallana or Coutinho regularly drop into the midfield to make a 3 man center on defense, which one depends on where the ball is) to help break up the transition from the front and pack the center once settled in defense then it works really well.

We can make an educated guess though. 

&gt; Well, basically until our dining room table was covered in twist-wrapped chocolate. It took some time.

Fortunately, dining room tables are a [standardized measurement](http://furniture.about.com/od/diningroomfurniture/a/Standard-Dining-Table-Measurements.htm).

Give that only two people were involved in this project, we'd expect it to be a husband or wife duo, and for the sake of averages we'll assume that they have the current average number of children - 1.7, rounded up to two.

Combined with the parent's internet affinity, we can make a reasonable assumption that they are of a more recent generation, and therefore are also likely to be living on a lower income with less money in savings than if they were baby-boomers or older.

This means they're likely to have a 4-seater dining room table, with a generous estimate of an upper diameter of 111.76cm, equating to an area of about 9700cm^2, or just shy of 7/500th of a standard association football pitch.

An average celebrations sweet is around 20mm in length, with a 10mm twist on either end. Combined with a ~10mm height, each sweet has an area of about 4cm^2.

That means that there is space for around 2425 celebrations sweets. Given that Teasers are a little bit larger and more rotund, and also that the researchers likely did not perfectly tesselate each sweet for maximum efficiency, I'd probably round that down to about 2200 to err on the side of caution.

Given these assumptions, the upper limit for the number of tubs opened and tested stands at 26 tubs (floored from 26.7).

Turns out I'm not just a little overweight. Medically, I'm borderline obese. I need to lose 3 stone just to be a healthy weight as per BMI. And if I'm being honest with myself, this weight taking me over the line isn't muscle, it's fat.

&gt; Private enterprise can be an excellent means of providing quality service as well as turning a profit... private providers have no incentive to go for quality, instead meeting minimum contractual requirements.

You pretty much refuted your own point... correctly, I might add... because private enterprises only goals is to minimise cost and maximise income - if you weren't meeting minimal contractual obligations then you would not be maximising income and minimising cost.

Private enterprise can provide quality of service, but this comes at premium prices, the kind that only well-off individuals purchase, not the sort you buy with public money. With public money, you have a limited budget, therefore you look to trim the costs as much as possible.

He lost a couple of steps in the aftermath of the ACL and can't quite keep up physically anymore.  He doesn't start to struggle until he's asked to cover far more ground than he can traverse in a timely manner (which often happens when he plays next to Gerrard in the 4-2-3-1 because he's sitting next to Stevie to one side, and then Gerrard wanders off and suddenly Lucas has to adjust faster than he's physically capable of doing).  He's a very smart defensive player and no one else in our team can play his role in this formation properly except *maybe* Can, but I don't think he's got anywhere near the discipline required just yet.  

He's also nowhere near the most upgradable player in the team, that's laughable.  Skrtel, Toure, Lovren, Johnson, Enrique, Allen, Borini, Lambert, and Balotelli are all more of a liability than Lucas is and you can also make an argument for Moreno and Manquillo to be on that list too if you try hard, but it isn't my personal opinion.  I actually like a lot of the players I just mentioned and think they have good roles to play for us, but all of them are easy to upgrade on.  Of course there are plenty of better players out there than Lucas, but that's the case for just about every area of our team and it's nothing out of the ordinary to be that way when you're not Real/Barca/Bayern/Chelsea/City.

A more mobile DM I think is really important for us to sign because he fits in better than Lucas with the energetic, high press we like.  That doesn't mean Lucas is terrible though by any means.  I never said Lucas is the best for us or a perfect fit, but I completely disagree that he's terrible and there is absolutely no other player in the squad who can protect our defense even remotely as well as he can consistently.

These are known as unsolicited goods. But if goods are sent to you by mistake, you need to contact whoever sent them to let them know and ask them to collect the goods. You might get goods sent by mistake if they are meant for someone else or you’ve been sent duplicate or extra items on top of what you ordered.

&gt;If you receive goods you have not ordered and which haven’t been sent by mistake, you can treat the goods as an unconditional gift and you can do what you want with them.

It's got a office politics-y  theme that people who enjoyed Len Deighton's Bernard Samson stuff or *The Sandbaggers* or *The Hour* or the aforementioned le Carré will enjoy.

I can only imagine they are setting NHS Tertiary care up to fail as it can be the only consequence of this. 

This illustrates very well why the mockery of an internal NHS market is so flawed. 

Hospitals will be left with the choice of going broke (remember these are the most needy and most expensive patients) or denying patients care. 

It sounds heartless but if I was a Hospital I would suggest the latter. The ridiculous way in which the NHS is structured means that it is not the responsibility of the Hospital to provide care. 

Please don't blame the hospitals, they cannot run a service at a loss any more than any other company can. If it cannot be done at the centrally imposed price then it is not up to the hospital to provide it, it is up to the Secretary of State to find someone who can.

The whole German nation pulled itself from the ashes by a motivation of hating the Jews. 99% of those people had nothing against the Jews. They were just regular people that felt helpless and lost and then someone came along and said fuck these guys and that motivated them to come together and do things because now they all had a common ""enemy"". 

A topical example? Look at Ferguson. Most of those people don't know what the fuck is going on but they feel a commradery now with their fellow peers and that's an addictive feeling. A want to fight along side your peers for a common cause.

The last few games Ryan's form has definitely taken a drop, and that's where I've seen the majority of his misplaced passed and questionable defensive work that you mentioned. But on form, the way he moves the ball in the midfield, especially when paired with Nabil, is what sold me on him. I don't think it's a coincidence that since he's joined the team we have seen more fluid, one touch passing out of midfield. He isn't going to receive the ball, pick his head up, and take on players to advance the ball like say Dembele. He just receives it and moves the ball on, keeping our play moving quickly instead of kinda hindering the pace of our play like Demebele's take ons tend to do sometimes. This might be a bad comparison but I've seen him as sort of our Michael Carrick type player. Everyone was so hyped on Carrick a few seasons ago, and Mason reminds of that style of play. Nothing flashy, just pass the ball on the the next player and keep everything moving. Add to that his good work rate, a decent shot from distance, and the fact that he can play a decent forward pass too and I think we've got a starting XI quality CM.

My first instructors car was a nightmare, my second instructors car was next to impossible to stall. My girlfriends car that I drive now is easy to stall, but easy to get used to. 

&gt;My dad keeps saying to release it slowly and when I do the car jumps and switches off.

What you are doing is jumping off the clutch without realising it. You are bringing up the clutch to rapidly, even though it feels like you are doing it slowly. I couldn't get my heard around my first instructors clutch at first, and I kept doing this very thing.

What solved that for me was pottering along in first without any accelerator. 

This explanation sounds complicated but for me it was by far the best solution.

Find a flat, level surface. Put it in first with the handbrake on. Very slowly (As in twice as slowly as you instinctively feel you want to) allow the clutch pedal out. You will notice a change in engine noise, this won't be obvious at first but your ears will tune to it.

As you reach the biting point, the front of the car will nose up very slightly. It's pretty obvious once you've seen it once. The more you release the clutch the more the cars nose will point up (as it's wanting to go forwards), keep releasing the clutch and you'll stall. 

Repeat letting out the clutch a few times to the point where the nose of the car just starts to move. 
At this point get rid of the handbrake, keep your feet exactly as they are and you will move forwards.

Apply accelerator smoothly as you very slowly let that clutch go completely. Slowly and smoothly is the key to a car you aren't used to. 

Might not be of any help to you, but it worked for me. You'll get your head around it in no time. It's amazing how quickly it becomes second nature.

A good example of contracting out  could be seen in most machine maintenance that goes on in Glos NHSFT; I can't speak for the effects on other trusts but I know for a fact that it is immeasurably cheaper for the work to be done by private contractors than by in house staff.

-4 for reading up on the specifics of the law to write an informed reply? Next time I won't bother...

tl;dr of earlier comment: copyright infringement can be either civil or criminally prosecuted depending on what the IP holder wants to do. As criminal process requires a greater burden of proof, most small stuff seems to get put through civil court unless there's significant damage incurred to the copyright holder or it involves widescale fraud/counterfeit/piracy.
[/edit] 

Not familiar with key aspects of this. However I'm mindful that this is likely a prosecution in Scottish court, where the law may differ slightly. He was also prosecuted for offences under the criminal offences section of the CDPA - they nailed him on the more severe counts of making available commercially (he was paid for every film he uploaded).

In fact I'm amazed he didn't get prison time, he committed the copyright equivalent of 'going equipped': (see S. 107):

&gt; Criminal liability for making or dealing with infringing articles, &amp;c.
&gt; 
&gt; (1)A person commits an offence who, without the licence of the copyright owner—
&gt; 
&gt; (a)makes for sale or hire, or
&gt; 
&gt; (b)imports into the United Kingdom otherwise than for his private and domestic use, or
&gt; 
&gt; (c)possesses in the course of a business with a view to committing any act infringing the copyright, or
&gt; 
&gt; (d)in the course of a business —
&gt; 
&gt; (i)sells or lets for hire, or
&gt; 
&gt; (ii)offers or exposes for sale or hire, or
&gt; 
&gt; (iii)exhibits in public, or
&gt; 
&gt; (iv)distributes, or
&gt; 
&gt; (e)distributes otherwise than in the course of a business to such an extent as to affect prejudicially the owner of the copyright,
&gt; 
&gt; an article which is, and which he knows or has reason to believe is, an infringing copy of a copyright work.
&gt; 
&gt; (2)A person commits an offence who—
&gt; 
&gt; (a)makes an article specifically designed or adapted for making copies of a particular copyright work, or
&gt; 
&gt; (b)has such an article in his possession,
&gt; 
&gt; knowing or having reason to believe that it is to be used to make infringing copies for sale or hire or for use in the course of a business.
