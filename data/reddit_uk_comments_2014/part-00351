The pharmacist is going to ask for ID, ask him if he is taking any other drugs or under the supervision of a doctor and if the kid wants to buy from this pharmacy again he will have to bring back the empty ampoules to stop him hoarding and selling it on.

- The incremental benefits of having Common Market membership over an extensive Free Trade Agreement are not that great, and are not worth the trade-off of being able to sign FTAs with better performing economies.
- The civil law system the EU works on chimes very poorly with the UK's common law system, and we're better off out of it. It ends up with law that should be decided by precedents in court cases being set by amateurish politicians.
- The European Parliament works on a party grouping system that the vast majority of the public won't ever vote on (instead focusing on the member parties), meaning that an executive based on such an election is highly undemocratic. It's much better to have national democracies.
- Items like the European Arrest Warrant disrespect long held British protections for those accused of crimes and ends up with some huge travesties of justice because many European nations have highly flawed judicial systems. 
- We are required by membership to subscribe to the ECHR and the ECJ, which are final courts that can effectively make new law with no checks on them. This is a system is severely problematic and has been criticised by a whole bunch of senior British justices.

Around 10 minutes is an improvement, but I don't think it is good enough.  Currently the journey is 1 hour according to Google, and they plan to get it down to around 50 minutes. The Bus is currently 55 minutes which stops in Pontypridd, with driving being 39 minutes. At peak times driving/bus will take longer.

Improving the trains, lines and quality of the overall services is good and I am glad to see more investment in South Wales, but I think the current issue is the time it takes for the train and bus to get into Cardiff.  These are perfect commuter locations that would massively help the city and the valley towns if this time was reduced.  Not addressing this issue is what I find crazy.

However, the Entente grand strategy was to bludgeon the Central Powers into defeat - with a complete blockade all that was left to do was to wage hard and bloody total war on the Central Powers until they were completely exhausted and defeated. Soldiers lives were seen as completely expendable to this goal (and from a purely numbers point of view - the Entente had no shortage of soldiers to throw at the problem so maybe this is true), which is what caused repeated mutinies and indeed one of the main catalysts to the fall of the Russian monarchy.

Personally I want them to actually become a movement, with an agenda that actually puts something new in place of what they tear down. 

From the revolutions in the Arab Spring, to the Orange revolutions in Eastern Europe, all modern led revolutions that refuse to have leaders simply tear down those in power who have failed them and ask for something 'better'. What they get usually is a group already on the fringe of power, see muslim brotherhood or ex soviet powers, that already have leaders, funding and a clear message a slim majority or sometimes just a vocal minority want. They take control and the countries often becomes worse because of it and very few truly free liberal democracies can be formed in those conditions. Then of course the backlash against those who are then in power can be worse, such as in Egypt, or no clear power emerges and the country turns into a bloody civil war such as Syria that never got enough power to oust the dictator or Lybia which never united its many disparate groups and is in a constant power struggle. 

If they don't elect leaders they will often do it naturally themselves with the loudest and most popular naturally forming and often being not suitable and even damaging to the movement. If they elected say a large amount of leaders, a dozen or so to keep the movement from being too centralised, that act as representatives and are bound by their 'constituents' then they could actually make some real and powerful change. These people could be put forward by anyone, vetted accordingly by the community and voted on to represent the movement to the media and work for their interests. They could do it pro bono or acting with donations from the community.

Even during the Falklands War soldiers were buried where they fell and were not repatriated. 

To play devil's advocate I think the conscious effort to engage the public more in military affairs will severely hamper the British Army in achieving its objectives further down the line due to its hesitancy to sustain casualties.

Reckless goes on to say that he had always been in favour of migrants being able to stay permanently - when he spoke last week and said ""we'd look favourably on them staying"" he was basing that statement on recent policy discussion with Farage.

&gt;__British Rail Class 315__ [alternating current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current) (AC) [electric multiple units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_multiple_units) (EMU) were built by [BREL York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BREL_York) works from 1980 to 1981. They were the fifth and final variety of [British Rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Rail)'s then-standard 1972 design for suburban EMUs, which eventually encompassed 755 vehicles and five Classes (Class [313](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Rail_Class_313)/[314](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Rail_Class_314)/315/[507](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Rail_Class_507)/[508](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Rail_Class_508)). Like the [Glasgow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow)-based Class 314 units, they are only able to operate from the 25 [kV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt) [overhead line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhead_line).

&gt;The fleet works inner-[suburban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb) services on the [Great Eastern Main Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Eastern_Main_Line) and the [Lea Valley Lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lea_Valley_Lines) run by the [train operating company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_operating_company) [Abellio Greater Anglia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abellio_Greater_Anglia) out of [London Liverpool Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_Street_station).

Yes, it is. I'm an economics undergrad at a top russell group university.

Supply increases, demand is stable, price drops. 

I totally agree on a living wage being paid, and having minimum wage increase with inflation (which it has more than done since its introduction).

What is the point in removing re-sits? Re-sits aren't cheating. We should be encouraging students who fail to study again and pass next time, not telling them to give up and live with failure. I hate the push to make everything just be judged on a couple exams.

Why in America is it that people are encouraged to return to school and learn, why are they encouraged to retake their high school diploma exams and actually better themselves, whereas in the UK we have this obsession with making children live with decisions they make when they are teenagers? If you fail once you're done and you're not supposed to go back and re-do it because 'oh well tough shit kid you failed once now deal with it.'

Here in the UK some people have some retarded attitude where if you fail one exam in school you should have your life destroyed then and there with 0 option to improve or learn from it.

Starting Smith,  Mohsni and Black all together was a disaster that you could see coming from the start. Only surprising thing there is Mohsni didn't somehow find a way to f up. Only 2 players in the starting 11 in Law and MacLeod that can create chances. Around the 70th minute taking off MacLeod for Boyd who if you give him chances he'll score him but if not he'll do fuck all and creating those chances was something the team couldn't do to save their life. Then taking off Daly for Clark, i don't mind Clark coming on but i would of taken Black off. No Templeton or Aird so there was no pace down the wing and no one who could put a good cross in to the heads of Daly or Boyd. Keeping 5 at the back even though you need a goal. With the way they were playing late in the game you would think they were up 1-0 instead of being beten. Then to seal it up Black decides he will just run over the Hearts player in the box.

It's games like these where Ally looks completely lost and out of his depth picking a team that had no creativity, no pace and the best chances were both from Law one being a free kick and the other having a shot gifted to him for it to only hit the bar.

Ironically the BNP this week said their immigration policy was identical to the Conservatives!  You see, the racists don't want black immigration and Europe is predominantly white, and since the Tories are wanting to appear tough on immigration but can't control it from Europe, they're having to cut down on immigration from outside the EU.

On the flat income tax, I don't agree with it, but I believe their position was a very high personal allowance. It would be people on middle incomes that would have got hit hardest, but it all depends on how they would have changed NI as well. I believe they have retracted the policy and will publish a new tax policy in the run up to the next election.

To be considered a non-domicile you will need to be seen to spend the majority of your time in Germany and not the UK. This changes depending on the country and I'm not sure what the rules are in England but for instance if I was to accept a position in Norway I would need to first of all be paid from the UK, not for instance by a Norwegian company, and I would need to be flying back 2-3 times a month. I would very much have a base of operations in the UK as well as a flat etc. in Norway. This would also be easier as Norway isn't in the EU!

If, however, you are planning to move to the UK and in truth make it your home it is both morally and legally right that you pay tax locally for the services you use. For instance pay council tax for your flat for the people that are emptying your bins (You will not be able to evade this at all if you have any UK domicile) or your National Insurance contributions if you plan on having a Doctor in the UK and not returning to Germany when you have an upset stomach.

Finally, as other's have pointed out, our tax system within the UK isn't all that different from most European countries and we are certainly cheaper than the Scandinavian countries so I cannot see how it would even begin to be efficient to do this.

The reason, by the way, your question has been met by such hostility is there is there is a lot of focus at this time on immigration and for immigrants such as yourself to be seen to be paying there way and being a functional member of society; much the same way as German has had a long standing questioning of Turkish and Polish immigration.

false,BezierPatch,null,null,"Leaving immigration aside as you have, do you not believe that any of those are offset by the benefit of the government being required to follow the EU's higher standards for individual rights?

* **General rights**: The EU charter is a solid basis for individual rights, championed by the UK, and is well enforced by the EU. However, the UK has no strong nor immutable equivalent, and the government has already declared its inability to reduce individual rights as a reason to leave the EU.

* **Privacy**: The Information Commissioner is given little to no actual enforcement powers (£500k max), the ECJ has shown it's willing to force multi-national companies to follow legislation.

* **Consumer policy**: The EU views consumer rights as a core value, and has resulted in incredibly important legislation such as Distance Selling Regulations, Unfair terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations and E-Commerce Reglations, which have all resulted from EU directives. Losing £1000 when you get scammed has a bigger effect than a general increase in cost of living.

* **Security of nationality**: The EU provides the right to freely leave the country of your nationality for work. The UK and Turkey are the only two states who have yet to ratify this. The risk of transferring abroad for a while and finding you lost your nationality because you didn't meet some obtuse requirement is removed working inside the EU (and is currently very real if you work outside the EU).

Basically for almost every problem I've had as an individual that has required me to refer to law my protection has been provided by an EU Directive. I can't afford a lawyer on retainer to work via common law and the vast majority of the population can't either.

***

From the Equality Act for discrimination issues, to Distance Selling regulations for when I've been scammed purchasing online, to unfair contract terms protecting from a particularly obsessed landlord and even to simple things like knowing I have the option to move abroad until my contract ends if my employer closes their UK office.

Pretty much every single one of the laws that have *directly* affected the quality and security of my life have come from EU Directives, and I have have absolutely no reason to believe that the UK would have implemented similar laws of its own will.

false,John_Wilkes,null,null,"&gt; General rights: The EU charter is a solid basis for individual rights, championed by the UK, and is well enforced by the EU. However, the UK has no strong nor immutable equivalent, and the government has already declared its inability to reduce individual rights as a reason to leave the EU.

While I support a Bill of Rights, I find it extremely problematic that the ECHR judges have no checks on their power. They have ruled that ""whole life terms"" in the UK are illegal, for example, and I find that very troubling. I would like a UK Bill of Rights, as has been proposed by the Conservatives, but one that can be amended democratically. This obviously isn't possible inside the EU.

&gt; Privacy: The Information Commissioner is given little to no actual enforcement powers (£500k max), the ECJ has shown it's willing to force multi-national companies to follow legislation.

Again, this is something I believe that could be passed at the UK level.

&gt; Consumer policy: The EU views consumer rights as a core value, and has resulted in incredibly important legislation such as Distance Selling Regulations, Unfair terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations and E-Commerce Reglations, which have all resulted from EU directives. Losing £1000 when you get scammed has a bigger effect than a general increase in cost of living.

We have an Office of Fair Trading in the UK that does a very good job at protecting consumers as it is. I think the EU takes a lot of credit for stuff that would happen anyway.

&gt; Security of nationality: The EU provides the right to freely leave the country of your nationality for work. The UK and Turkey are the only two states who have yet to ratify this. The risk of transferring abroad for a while and finding you lost your nationality because you didn't meet some obtuse requirement is removed working inside the EU (and is currently very real if you work outside the EU).

I'm not sure I understand this.

In general, I think there's a lot of stuff where power passes from the national level to the EU level, and EU supporters then claim there would be no protections in place if we left. This isn't the case. With the European Arrest Warrant, for example, it replaced existing extradition treaties, so the ""advantage"" is much overhyped.

I do think there are some good things that come from the EU that wouldn't have happened without it: the telephone charges across Europe, for instance. However, I feel these are largely small fry compared to the large economic benefits, the ability to control our own borders, and the ability to have a more democratic society.",0,1416670313,null,0,false,0,cm9ueji,t3_2n2fkb,t1_cm9ueji,t1_cm9u9he,null,1425896695,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The EU provides a safety net for human rights, by having two levels (National and EU) which would both have to be compromised before we start to lose those rights.

During the time period where these allegations are being made, the 1960s-1980s, the world was not such a safe place.

What seems to be emerging from this scandal is a bit sinister. The security services seem to be implying that they knowingly participated in a complex game of sexual blackmail with government officials. Some of which included allowing children to be abused. And what's more, they still think it was worth the trade off.

I'm sorry, I am just of the massively controversial opinion that equal crimes should be dealt with equally regardless of who does them. I didn't know that was the definition of an apologist. How do I redeem myself? Should I adopt your opinion that we should only pay attention to violent psychopaths if they're Muslim? That sounds like a wonderful idea! Death to all Islam! That's a shame because I think we should cut the bullshit and start treating all religions equally as the mental illnesses they are, or is that being an apologist. I will not ignore one religion in favour of another, I will condemn them all! Or do you somewhat support christianity in their endeavours to force biblical law upon us all? This isn't being an apologist, this is telling the truth: all religion is Cancer and it must die.

I'm not trying to distract anyone about anything, but since even mentioning Christianity counts as ""distraction"", what do you want me to do? Deny christianity is doing these things and start screaming about how every muslim is out to take over the world?

When I moved to my current place, that area was included in my search radius.

Let's put it yet another way. Say for a second that is the only source of cheap housing in north Bristol, and that with changes to the M32 leading the way there is significant regeneration of the area. Demand in the area rises, Landlords put prices up, suddenly there is no cheap area. Is that better? If prices are pushed down by the M32, then reducing or eliminating that impact increases prices.

More than that, even the Energy Savings Trust says the most efficient speed is 55-65mph, so, for the least pollution, we should perhaps be setting the limit at 60 or 70, exactly where the limit currently is for most of the M32.

People are raised all the time with stupid, hateful points of view - just because they hold that doesn't make it something to tolerate.

You might think, ""Ok, but this was twenty years ago..."" but there's no evidence I've ever seen that suggests that anything much changed.

In one of his shows Reginald D Hunter describes his father's Nut Holding theory of Economics.  It goes something like this:  *There's a man whose name and face you don't know and he's got a grip on your nuts.  And there's another man whose name and face you don't know and he's got a grip on that guy's nuts.  And there's another man whose name and face you don't know and he's got a grip on the second guy's nuts and this goes on all around the world.  When one of you coughs everyone's nuts hurt.*

So, how can that relate to the way the office of the whip functions?  Here's the thing:  Nearly everyone in front bench politics has either got a man *(whose name and face they do in this instance know)* who has a grip on their nuts.  The ones who don't have any dirt on them in the whips' little black book has his hands wrapped around someone's nuts and has been culpable in hiding the very dirt that makes it possible for the office of the whip to function.

You can only stop that sort of practice through a wholesale clean up.

As I've put it before none of the political parties will call the others out on their nonsense because your lies this term will be my lies in the next term.

We don't need to spend as much as we do on the military.

Sweden spends about £6 billion p/a and seems to be doing OK, so I'm guessing that there could be about £30 billion in the pot we could use to say, put toward our annual education bill and reduce that by a third - or even god forbid invest a third more than we are currently and start to educate the population a little better.  A major hospital such as Derriford in Plymouth costs about £370m a year to run. You could run 80 hospitals of similar size for that saving - and still have an functional armed force.

I hear a lot of rage and anger over Islam here, every time a story about Muslims appears on this sub everyone runs around screaming THIS IS PROOF ISLAM AND MUSLIMS ARE EVIL, WE SHOULD BAN IT ALL ASDOFGIHASD;LHOERSF;IHFOI.

Now if I said ""we should ban Islam"", do you not think I would get some upvotes for that post. Islam can be a terrible religion what with Islamic state all the terror groups, Islamo-neds calling themselves ""shiara patrols"". It's something we can all do without and I hope you agree with that...

But then what if other religions. Islam isn't the only psychopathic authoritarian religion. It's not even the most successful in getting it's way in the west. It's the one we pay the most attention to. If we rid ourselves of Islam we won't be rid of religious authoritarianism, we'll just be left with one more people seem to like.

In Russia, you can be arrested for holding hands with a member of the same sex or even just being openly gay. In America you can be arrested for having a miscarriage or denied prescriptions by your pharmacist for ""religious reasons"". You can be tied to a gurney and forced to have an unnecessary C section by order of the court in Ireland, and in southern Africa there's laws being passed that would make Saudi Arabians puke with shock in it's barbarity. You can't run for office if you are an atheist in some states in the US and you have to go to your doctor to be told government-mandated lies if you want an abortion in others. Now if the force behind those laws was Islam, we'd be up in arms, but it's not. It's Christianity.

And it's not just Christianity and Islam. Hinduism and Sikhism have a force marriage problem in this country, the Jews are assaulting people in the streets for not wearing the right things in their areas in Israel and we have the whole set promoting ex gay ""therapies"", which have been proven to do more harm than good.

But consider  - they're generally the same, and mostly can be summarised as ""treat others as you want to be treated"". If that's the case, you would have that even in a world without religion. Except it's not just that everyone wants to be treated like everyone else. Humans are greedy. Humans are bastards. We always want more.

1) The new system is working.  Possession wound up being pretty close to an even split, which is far and away removed from what I was expecting initially.

2) Depth, depth, depth.  We were missing Sakho, Valencia, Kouyate, **and** Song, to say nothing of Noble coming off for Jarvis -- but the match never seemed as dire as some of last season.  I didn't feel that we were truly out of the match until the final attempt got picked up by Howard.

Not terribly happy about the result, but we're going to be fine.  A lot of the folks that started today should never be used as anything other than impact subs -- namely Carroll, Cole, and Nolan.  We'll bounce back soon, lads.

Err...that's Tennant's Doctor on a good day.  On a bad day, and especially by the end of his run, I wouldn't describe Ten as 'happy-go-lucky.'    More like 'intermittently depressed and maniacal.'

The interesting thing about Capaldi's role(and the writing this season, of course), is that he's really bringing to the forefront some of the glimpses we've seen of the Doctor's darker side since the revival started.  

What's interesting about Capaldi's Doctor is that he's gone past the point of depression, or reactionary anger at the events of his life, to a point where he's developed a shell of seeming-callousness that's barely contained half the time.   Where previous Doctors would be vaguely bi-polar in their moods; Capaldi's a truly scarred but experienced Doctor who approaches each new adventure with an eye largely towards how to best manipulate the situation towards his favor, and has largely forgotten how to get attached to people he meets on the way.

false,Helpopotamus,lfc87,,"This game for me is a pretty big one. We've come off a truly terrible run of form where we've tried the same redundant tactics every single game. Rodgers has had 2 weeks to mill over a lone striker up top and how ineffective it is with our current batch of players. 

We don't have a striker who is 'intelligent' enough to act as a solo creative output. Yes Balotelli played as a lone striker at Milan,  but there, the wingers/ midfielders were the primary output  whereas here we're used to having 2 forwards who did all themselves last year, and still haven't figured out how to work without them. 

It's not 'modern' but I truly believe we should take a note from Pellegrini and play a 4-4-2.

Lovren needs a break. He's out of form and under pressure to perform. Play Toure and Skrtel at the back. Toure isn't a long term solution, but he's proved capable enough to fill in for now.

Our current tactics seem to have moved back to just keeping the ball. We play it around our back four trying to find little passes. This doesn't work. Teams know what we're trying to do and press us in our own half and we get completely overrun. QPR did that to us, and we were ridiculously fortunate to not lose by a 3 goal margin to them let alone somehow escape with all the points. If Harry Redknapp could figure out a strategy to completely destroy us, it's not going to hold up against the rest of the league. 

We need more quick incisive passing. We have the fucking players. Coutinho/Lallana/Gerrard all capable of finding a game winning ball. But we sit in our own half when have players like Sterling/Mario/Markovic who could burn past defenders. Yes we'd lose the ball more, but we'd put them on the back foot and teams on the back foot make mistakes. We're always on the back foot recently and eventually we crack. At the moment we allow them the time to co-ordinate themselves and track back to defend against us. 

The bottom line is we have more quality than 75% of this league comfortably, and we can compete with the other 25%. There are very few games where we should be as cautious as we've got.

The formation I'd play is something a long these lines:

                               Mignolet

     Manquillo     Skrtel               Toure     Moreno
   
    Lallana      Henderson(If fit)/Can   Lucas (Gerrard has been a target to exploit for other teams)   Coutinho


                     Sterling

                                                Balotelli

&gt; And I should apologise for sarcastically implying you held opinions that you did not express...

No problem. It's the internet - it happens :) I would caution that one of the biggest problems about the so-called immigration 'debate' in this country is that it is largely one based on gut feelings and anecdotal evidence based on one's surroundings, and people's emotions are easily manipulated when even a basic understanding of how immigration works is almost unknown amongst the general public. And as you point out, that's true of most people. Why would any British citizen understand how immigration works? That's true of most places - if you've never needed to use it, you don't know what it is.

An analogy I often use is nuclear power, because it tends to draw strong opinions based either on what others have told you, or what you wish to be true. Ask most people, particularly the anti-nuke crowd, a simple question like, ""What is radiation?"" and you'll be met with a variety of incorrect answers. ""It's this stuff... that comes from like radioactive material, that poisons you and causes cancer."" Taking an hour or two to understand the basics of nuclear fission puts one in a much better position to critically analyse the pros and cons of nuclear power.

&gt; First, the ONS graph shows some recent fluctuations, but net immigration is still close to all time highs. (By all time, I mean all time during our recorded history...)

I agree. It is still indeed high, although of course what we're seeing right now is mainly a substantial reduction in non-EU immigration being replaced by EU immigration. Also, I'd point out that the 2013 estimates claim that some 15% of inward migration to the UK are British citizens. The majority of these would be Brits living abroad for long periods of time, now returning to the UK. I can only offer personal anecdotes as to why that's happening right now based on people I know who have done this, but my three main culprits would be: 1) The financial downturn has caused many people to lose their primary means of support wherever they lived, and might now need to return to the UK to make another go of a career. 2) People deciding to start families in their home country, which is often influenced by the perceived strength of British education, the desire to raise their kids in an English-speaking country, and desire to be close to relatives who can help with child care, and 3) I wonder to what extent Britain's ageing population is compelling more people to return to take care of ailing parents. 

&gt; The Conservatives have trumpeted their intention to reduce it, but as you point out their policies have mostly affected the people that we should be letting in.

I would say yes and no. I would certainly argue that the policies have hit a lot of people who *should* be coming in, namely: 1) legitimate spouses of British citizens who cannot meet the new insanely high financial maintenance threshhold that is truly draconian, 2) post-study workers, who make a positive financial contribution to the country in graduate positions with their UK-based skills and knowledge, and perhaps a few other stragglers. However, one of the bigger overhauls has been to other sponsored family members, not just spouses and dependent children, meaning that it is no longer possible to sponsor members of your more extended family to come to the UK. I fully agree with this, as the economic motivations for this were always a bit suspect in my mind from the very beginning, and I would personally maintain that this was one of the driving forces for what most would consider a 'negative' type of immigration. I address all of this a bit further down, so keep going.

There are also more stringent English language requirements, which is fair enough. Generally speaking, and this is a massive generalisation, I think the system currently in place for non-EU migrants is pretty damn solid. If I were the Minister for Immigration, or the Home Secretary, I might tweak a few things here and there, and radically overhaul the enforcement regime, but the system itself is actually quite robust now.

&gt; the movement is so large and so asymmetric that a renegotiation on free movement would surely succeed. The Eurozone's policy failures are so large, and the movement so asymmetric, that they are in no position to object. 

Perhaps. Just a few weeks ago, Merkel stated that she would absolutely **not** negotiate on the freedom of movement. That being said, I think there are enough countries in the UK's position to want to do something that an arrangement could be reached that may, for example, require all migrants to apply for residence permits if moving to another EU country. This would be my proposed solution, and this is why:

At the moment, EU citizens can move to another country to work, study, or live if you've got the means to be self-funded and not rely on public benefits. Now that's all nice and well, but the means of enforcement is problematic for *all* European nations since it's difficult to ascertain whether or not the migrant did in fact undertake a genuine job search, whether they do intend to be employed, and even when they entered the country (no stamps are placed in passports as this signifies that the person is subject to immigration control, which most EU migrants aren't, although that can vary). This is why, even though you're not meant to be allowed to claim public benefits for at least a year, it's hard to enforce this rule. No one knows exactly what you've done and exactly how long you've been there.

At the moment, Croatians like myself are under transitional arrangements. This means that most Croatians have to go through a simplified version of the normal work permit arrangements, unless you qualify for an exemption (fortunately I did). Even so, Croatians like me should apply for a certificate showing that we're exempt from the transitional rules. Theoretically, if we meet the requirements, we're not in any way obliged to apply for a certificate, but it makes job searching much easier to be able to prove it, so most do.

My idea is this: require *all* EU citizens wanting to undertake activities in another member state to apply for a residency certificate. Many do anyway, because if they intend to apply for permanent residency (often before naturalising as citizens) then the residency certificate can be useful to prove how long you've resided in your new country. Nevertheless, requiring a residency certificate before accessing any public services would make it much, much easier to enforce rules that already exist in terms of waiting before accessing things like JSA, housing benefit, etc., as it would provide a clear-cut idea of how long someone has lived in the country and when they first arrived. It would also act as a deterrent for any would-be fraudsters (in my own personal experience, word-of-mouth is a better deterrent than any rule could ever be). I think this would be both more feasible and more effective than any wholescale renegotiation about the fundamental rights of EU citizens, and would be far more palatable than almost anything else proposed.

**tl;dr New rule: before accessing *any* public services, all EU migrants must apply for a residence certificate that demonstrates when they entered the country and what their intended purpose (work/study) is.**

&gt; Third, I am not sure how much of the current immigration policy is the result of the last Labour government, but encouraging immigration was surely deliberate immediately they came to power. (Hey, I voted for them, and I feel I know how they thought.) Much of the motivation was of course to import more Labour voters. Now that is not cricket. 

I would indeed place a fair amount of the 'blame' at Blair's feet. It's worth mentioning that before 2000, the system was laughably relaxed. It was after 2001 in particular that the system suddenly started to tighten up. Before then, Britain truly was an open door.

This is another thing I find common in British political discourse - this notion that if something was true once, it'll always be the case. Britain has not been an open door, at least for migrants whose entry can be controlled, for 14 years now, but it was before then, so it must still be. You hear the same thing surrounding rates of alcohol consumption: 'Binge Britain', 'Booze Britain', anything to paint young people as radically irresponsible with alcohol use. The fact is that binge drinking in the UK peaked back around 1999/2000 and has been falling ever since. In fact, it's gone into freefall since the recession began. But because it *was* true once, it's hard to shift people's perceptions about the current state of affairs.

I'd also add, as something of an irresponsible aside that I alluded to earlier, that a common theme you hear from all corners of society is that people don't have a problem with immigration per se, just 'certain people' who don't tend to integrate well. Let's face it: we all know damn good and well that they mean Pakistanis. Pakistani immigration has also been in terminal decline since 2001, and the vast majority of Pakistani people you meet in the UK will likely have arrived before 2000 when things were much different. A few continued to arrive as sponsored family members, until that system was radically overhauled a few years ago and restricted more or less to spouses, dependent minor children and dependent parents. No more siblings, aunts/uncles, cousins and so on. So that specific shibboleth of immigration has already been 'fixed', so to speak. As to working on Pakistani integration into British society, that's certainly something that needs serious addressing, but my *personal view* is that the actual issue of new arrivals from Pakistan flooding in has been stemmed, and now it's time to work on those who are already here.",0,1416677669,null,0,false,0,cm9x94k,t3_2mz9or,t1_cm9x94k,t1_cm96m23,null,1425895278,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

&gt; As you point out, the number of 'illegals' and overstays is unknown and only vague estimates seem to be available. I am mystified at the government's ineffectiveness here -- do you understand it? 

Do I understand it? Frankly, no. It's somewhat baffling to me as well, because I believe this is the **single biggest thing that could be done to not only combat illegal immigration, but to deter would-be criminals from entering in the first place**.

Honestly, *this* above all other things is a damn farce to me. Blair eliminated exit checks and border points back in 1998. I presume it was a cost-saving measure, although there may have been some nefarious intent as well. I couldn't say. However, if anyone was actually serious about tackling illegal immigration, as well as visa overstays, they would 1) reinstate exit checks and 2) move to an electronic visa system. This would make a world of difference.

Right now, most illegal immigration enforcement comes from random spot checks on employers (and not PwC or Vodafone, we're talking a halal butcher's in south London kind of thing). Most of their intel is either old-fashioned detective work in conjunction with local police authorities or anonymous tipoffs to immigration hotlines. It's hideously inefficient and quite ineffective. It's effectively a glorified fishing expedition - you raid somewhere dodgy on the off chance that there might be illegal workers there. You don't actually *know* unless you've spent weeks trying to build a picture of each employee and crosschecked a paper immigration file in Sheffield with their presumed identity. It's hard work.

The whole of the Schengen area, and indeed most other countries, have immigration exit checks so that you can tell either upon leaving a country, or upon reentering it, whether or not their previous grant of leave was breached simply by looking at the entry and exit stamps. It's simple. Or you could digitise *everything* at great initial expense (like Australia has) to give yourself an even better chance. If you've got a 90 day visa and haven't been 'scanned out', you'll show up in the next day's shitlist of 'people who haven't left'. Then they can look out for you. If you go through an exit check and they scan your passport, a big red window shows up on the screen saying: WARNING: VISA OVERSTAY BY XX DAYS. Then the banhammer comes down. If you don't go through an exit point and remain illegally, then that same information can be disseminated to Jobcentres, local police and council, and the next time you show up to any of those, shit gets real. At the very least you know that Joe Bloggs is out there overstaying, so you've got an exact name (plus all previous visa applications and personal info) to work with.

As an immigrant, being a migrant is something of both a right and a privilege. I would not consider this to be a breach of privacy. As long as a legal mechanism existed to permanently wipe most of that data upon becoming a British citizen, I think that safeguards most people's personal info.

As another aside, I could be wrong, but I seem to remember reading a few years ago that most British airports, even new ones, still have ample blank space available after security checks specifically allocated for the purpose of reinstating exit checks. Kind of like how all distances on British road signs are actually in nice round metres (every yard is actually a metre, every mile is actually exactly 1600 metres, etc.) specifically so that when the UK inevitably metricates its road signs, none of the posts have to be moved. Same general principle. I'd love to see someone act on it.

At this point, expenses be damned. It will free up local police to not have to devote time and resources to immigration task forces, the UKBA can deal with known criminals on their own terms, and more importantly, public trust in the immigration system can be rebuilt. And as I said earlier, word gets out. If enough people are ringing their mates at home saying, ""Fuck it, they're coming down hard on everyone. I can't leave the country or they'll flag me up at the border, best to stay at home,"" then that's the kind of publicity that money can't buy directly.

&gt; I suspect the main reason is that senior politicians and civil servants feel remote from this issue, and they decided to declare it a policy priority without actually doing anything either desirable or effective. 

I'd agree to an extent. I actually think that's true not only of immigration, but of most things in general. When the term 'political class' refers to a group of individuals who, almost by design, have no concept of the lives of 'ordinary' people, you're bound to get them making policy based not in the best interests of the people but in.. something else.

So there's my solutions, which I think the UK could secure from the EU. Get all EU migrants to apply for residence certificates to prove their right to access public services, and reinstate exit checks and an electronic visa regime. They're all imminently doable and would take no significant effort. Maybe time and money, but it's not exactly reinventing the wheel. Those three simple things would go a long way towards fixing most problems that still remain, and should do a lot to restore public confidence in the Home Office, which is rightly shaken. Hell, if Cameron could do that, it would also restore his image and take the wind out of Ukip's sails.

**EDIT**: I just wanted to share [this video of the head of the Migration Advisory Committee](http://youtu.be/vraHOolvhr8?t=7m35s) speaking last week about immigration trends in the UK. It's a looooooong video, but if you're interested in the subject, it's absolutely vital. One thing that his talk raises that is **very important to note** is that inward flows *also* include people coming to the UK as students, which I think is a bit strange. International students don't work a whole lot (and are restricted in how much work they can do) and now have no recourse to stay in the UK after their course ends.

I disagree, and your example proves why. In the 60s the big threat was WWIII and the USSR wiping us off the planet. That's already a far bigger threat than what we face today. What makes it worse is that we couldn't do anything to prevent it other than arm ourselves and acquire more destructive technology than our most powerful enemy (who would then rearm themselves in response, thus making their possible destruction of us all the more likely if war did happen).

The BAE example is much safer than that. The SFO investigation was called off due to national security. The morals/ethics of it can be debated, but when the debate is national security, its beside the point. The threat was the Saudis would stop their counterterrorism investigations.

We are a bit lucky though that this is West Ham of new, rather than a classic Big Sam team, as I am sure they would have tightened up a lot more at 1-1, and we wouldn't have got the space to score our second.

Lukaku's decision making is shockingly suspect, but he was once again rewarded by being in the right place at the right time- but on balance of the performance, he was again very poor. Andy Carroll at the other end really gave us a lesson on how a big striker can cause problems, and I have never seen Lukaku even attempt that. Whilst Carroll couldn't hit a barn door, he is a very effective target man, and asks a lot of questions of defenders... Hopefully shadowing Big Dunc will inject some of this type of football into Lukaku's head. 

Barkley was decent though, you can see he is building his fitness- and whilst he is also shocking at decision making, his ability to change the pace of an attack is something we have missed greatly this season. 

Distin was pretty impressive today, he stuffed a lot of attacks and his positioning was sublime. Hopefully he is over the Voodoo Curse that kept him out of the side earlier in the season. 

Osman has a decent enough game- very similar to how he used to play under Moyes when he sat with the line of play and kept things simple. Whilst it gave McCarthy a bit more work off the ball, on the ball he was very smart and kept the ball moving, as was asked of him.

&gt;___The Millionaire Next Door: The Surprising Secrets of America's Wealthy___ ([ISBN 0-671-01520-6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/0671015206)) is a 1996 book by [Thomas J. Stanley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_J._Stanley) and William D. Danko.

&gt;This book is a compilation of research done by the two authors in the profiles of 'millionaires'. In this case they used the term 'millionaire' to denote U.S. households with net-worths exceeding one million dollars (USD).

&gt;The authors compare the behaviour of those they call ___UAWs__ (Under Accumulators of Wealth)* and those who are ___PAWs__ (Prodigious Accumulator of Wealth)*.

false,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; I disagree, and your example proves why. In the 60s the big threat was WWIII and the USSR wiping us off the planet. That's already a far bigger threat than what we face today. 

Maybe I could have been clearer.    
As you say, 1960's...  A real possibility of nuclear war.    
2006 (BAE investigation gets canned) issues with global terrorism.    
Now:  Basically the same as 2006.

The excuse, ""This is essential for national security (and therefore we don't have to justify it)."" is exactly the same.

Or, to make my point as cleanly as possible, the world (or at least the bit of it we inhabit) is far safer than it was fifty years ago.  The excuses used to cover things up are just the same.

&gt;The morals/ethics of it can be debated, but when the debate is national security, its beside the point.

This is where you and I are going to part company.  I appreciate that sometimes there will be a need to make the least bad decision and that that might even stretch to, ""We allowed some appalling thing to happen to stop something worse.""  There's no point where I'm going to buy, ""It's national security so morals and ethics are beside the point.""

In fact, as I see it, the issue of tolerating or permitting the least bad thing to prevent something worse should explicitly be a moral/ethical issue.

Tumblrinas didn't like that he was no longer adorable and cuddly, though this crowd was exaggerated because of how loud they are, and was often parodied. It was likely a very small number. 

The first episode wasn't fantastic, and fans (who like Capaldi as an actor) questioned his characterization. Criticism waned somewhat as the series went on but continues today. 

I would say that reaction to Capaldi and series 8 has been mixed to positive. Maybe 70% like it, a 20% lukewarm/meh, and 10% didn't like it. But there's always going to be a 10% like that who, when given a free $20 bill, will ask for two $10 instead.

&gt; ""EU citizens who have been established in the UK for seven years or more [**after UKIP introduce the policy**] will, depending on their circumstances, be able to apply for permanent leave to remain

Either Farage intended that statement to mean all EU immigrants that had been here &lt;7 years would be deported pretty much on day 1 of UKIP's government or he meant that deportations would only start after 7 years so that migrants would not fall foul of a policy that didn't exist when they decided to move country. The latter would be obviously fairer and seems to be what Farage is saying he intended but Reckless seems to have been under the impression that deportations would begin ASAP after they were given time (a few months maybe? How long does it take to process requests?) to apply for leave to remain, not 7 years. 

7 years is not a temporary 'transitional period' that's 1.5 Parliaments, UKIP could be out of power by the time the policy took effect and the new government could reverse it. Either Farage is lying about his original intention and threw his colleague under the bus to protect the party's image or Reckless had no idea what the immigration policy of the party he just defected to (so that he could protest immigration) actually is which seems.....poorly planned.

While it isn't illegal, be careful not to use the cycle lane because we're not allowed to use them. 

If there's space to cut across the front of the car in front, by all means do it. It'll prevent anyone around you from crowding you if you're not quite quick enough to pull away. Again, don't put yourself into any cycle boxes. The law is complicated around it, but try to avoid stopping in them unless you really, really need to. 

Some other points to consider. Don't take risks if you don't feel confident or familiar with the road ahead. I've been riding years, but I'll be very hesitant about filtering on roads that I don't know. You'll end up positioned on the wrong side or traffic etc.

&gt;The revised result means that RBS, which is 80 percent-owned by the British government, was the worst performing UK bank in the European stress test, which assessed whether banks have enough capital to weather another economic crash.

&gt;The revelation is another embarrassment for the bank, which has been fined in the past two weeks for failing to stop its traders attempting to manipulate foreign exchange rates and for a computer systems failure two years ago which locked millions of customers out of their bank accounts.

&gt;RBS said on Friday it held core capital under full Basel III rules of 5.7 percent after the adverse scenarios, scraping past the minimum 5.5 percent required. It had initially appeared to pass the test comfortably, holding core capital of 6.7 percent.

&gt;""We are examining how this mistake was made, and will be working with our regulators as we do so,"" RBS said.

This shit annoys me. Hugo and the article explain that they like the trajectory of the club. And then only a few months into the season, the whole plan is done. The media needs to stop perpetuating the situation at our club. I know people get frustrated with the term transition year, because we have apparently been in one forever. This is more than a transition year, this is not a new manager coming in and putting some new tactics on the white board. 

Poch has been given the responsibilioty to repair the damage caused in the past fourish years. It doesnt matters who's fault it is ffs. What matters is how we fix it now. Levy has shown signs he is willing to give Poch the time to do so. As the THST stated in their meeting, there is a concesus at the club that we have a highly talented manager and we trust him take the club forward given a proper chance. Im going off the original post a bit but just have to get this stuff off my chest. i know the argument, yeah i just want us to see good football and i dont care if we win. This mentality is daft. Arent there days at your job where you just dont give 100%, or you just cant be bothered, or its just not your day? So are you saying we can never play a bad game? and if we do, we're in a crisis. We have played 11 games in the league. We lose a few bad games and suddenly we are in a crisis?! We are not in danger of relegation and there seems to be an issue with our players. Is it supposed to be rosey every match? 

Football team's forms are cyclical. Just because we are in a relatively short down cycle it does not mean we are failing our plans to achieve what we need to achieve. Look at the fucking giants our club is against in the financial graphs introduced by enic. For those of you who dont realize how fortunate we are, look at teams like villa who are ""sleeping giants"". We were in the same position as them 14 years ago and now look at the trajectory we have taken. It took 14 years to get us to where we are and we are still punching above our weight on average. As we get closer to the top, its going to get harder and possibly take longer to achieve our plans. 

TLDR: Can we just chill out and look at the club long term and give it a few years. love you lot",0,1416681812,null,0,false,0,cm9z3ya,t3_2n3fug,t1_cm9z3ya,t3_2n3fug,null,1425894412,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Many cultures created music and notation through intuition, they were driven by the evocation of vibrations, not maths. And the western scale you talk about is only the dominant way of tuning. There are many others.

I don't find that on the surface an equation that I don't understand, is as breathtaking or visceral (in the moment) as a painting by Turner for example. There is a certain amount of groundwork involved in finding beauty in pure maths. The same isn't true for many types of art.

The way I see it, is that you need to get to a level of skill in maths to understand things, whereas you can listen to Miles Davis and immediately get hit with pure talent. If you started rabbiting on to Miles about maths he'd blast you in the ear with a quick riff and you'd shit your pants. Point being what you're arguing comes from artistic intent - not technical approximation of that intent. Ya dig?

The fuel additive is a ""fuel borne catalyst"" (FBC) which is a metallic or organometallic compound (e.g. cerium oxide nanoparticles, or ferrocene). The car has a reserve tank of this additive installed at the factory, and every time you fill up the fuel tank, a dose of additive is dispensed into the fuel tank.

These fuel borne catalysts result in the formation of nanoparticles of catalyst material during combustion and these attach to soot particles. The catalyst reduces the ignition temperature of the soot, so that the soot burns off when it lodges in the DPF.

Without catalyst assistance, the DPF has to get to 800-900 C to ignite the soot and start the self-cleaning cycle.  This may require the car's ECU to detune the engine, or trigger a special fuel injector to dispense fuel directly into the exhaust pipe, in order to heat up the filter. Some cars use this system (e.g. Toyota diesels have an extra exhaust pipe fuel injector to heat up the filter)

With a catalyst in the fuel, the soot will ignite at 500-600 C, which is normal exhaust gas temperature under most driving conditions, allowing the filter to self-clean without the need for forced regeneration cycles. (Peugeot and Citroen use a catalyst system to assist filter cleaning).

Urea tends to be used in commercial vehicles (it's often sold under the brand-name ""adblue""). The urea is nothing to do with soot, it's to do with a smog forming pollutant called NOx, that is produced when fuel is burned in ""lean burn"" conditions. 

Petrol engines burn at ""stoichiometric"" conditions (just the right mix of fuel and air), but diesel engines burn lean (more oxygen than needed).   To deal with the NOx problems, there are two options - one is to reduce the amount of oxygen that a diesel engine can get. The usual way to do this is to use ""exhaust gas recirculation"" which makes the engine ""breath in"" some exhaust gas, although some manufacturers have added a throttle to their diesel engines (throttling an engine wastes a lot of energy, and one of the reason diesels are more efficient is because they historically didn't use a throttle). The problem with EGR is that it leave soot and crud all over the internals of the engine, and can block up valves, turbochargers, and other mechanisms.

For commercial vehicles, where manufacturers and operators are more interested in reliability, then a catalytic converter can be used to remove the NOx. The petrol design of catalytic converter only works in ""stoichiometric"" burn conditions, and cannot work for more than a few seconds at a time in ""lean"" conditions. So, for a diesel catalyst, a different system is needed. In these vehicles, urea solution is sprayed into the catalyst, and the catalyst reacts the urea and NOx, producing harmless gasses like Nitrogen and water vapour. 

In the USA where NOx regulations are much stricter, urea has been used in passenger cars for a while. However, some of the new Euro 6 cars have started to use urea NOx reduction as well as EGR in order to meet emissions limits.",0,1416685466,null,0,false,0,cma0sg0,t3_2mzl9w,t1_cma0sg0,t1_cm99i6x,null,1425893466,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

false,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"It's a good idea, **but**...

Government *(whichever flavour you look at, not just the current lot)* see votes in kicking people who need help.  It's a side-effect of people believing that we're running under something like a meritocracy.  If you need support it must be your own fault somehow - Maybe you're lazy, or dumb, or a scrounger.  If this is the case plainly you don't deserve help and should be publicly kicked rather than supported.

Public sector IT is consistently over-priced and tends to run badly.  This is *(in my opinion)* because they're tied into abusing buying requirements and (most importantly) the decisions are made by people who aren't fit for the role they're in.  If they were fit for the job they'd earn more in the private sector (and that guy **is** in the private sector, trying to bamboozle the public sector dumbass who gets sent along to negotiate).

In order to do something like this quickly and efficiently you have to trust the people in decision making positions.  The Civil Service is moribund under processes that reflect the complete lack of trust they operate in.  Add to this the fact that there's a pretty good body of evidence to the effect that targets are handed down to do things like sanction people's benefit claims and you can see the drive is in the opposite direction from what you propose.

Universal Credit is already supposed to do this.  As you said there's a rapid reclaim process it just doesn't work.  This is because of the above.

&gt;

&gt;__""White van man""__ is a stereotype found in the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) of the driving of smaller-sized commercial vans,  perceived as selfish, inconsiderate, mostly working class and aggressive.  According to this stereotype, the ""white van man"" is an independent tradesperson, such as a [plumber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumber) or [locksmith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locksmith), self-employed, or running a small enterprise,  for whom driving a commercial vehicle is not the main line of business, as it is for a professional freight-driver.

&gt;The term White Van Man has been used as part of road safety campaigns by the [Freight Transport Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freight_Transport_Association).

I think that Townsend is our best option on the left without Chadli available, and I'm a huge fan of how Soldado improves the overall chance creation of our other attackers.  

If we struggle, I'd like to see us try out a sort of diamond like this:

Capoue

Mason - Eriksen

Lamela

Kane - Soldado

In theory, Soldado would swing out wide and Kane would be the focal point in the middle, with Lamela taking advantage of space created by the two striker moving all over the place.  Though with Hull quite possibly running three center backs, I'm not sure that would work as well as it would against a back four.

&gt;The ""__Famine Song__"" is a song sung by some [loyalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalists) in Northern Ireland and [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland) and is normally directed at [Irish people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people), [those of Irish descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_diaspora) or those with perceived affiliations to Ireland.  It is also sung by fans of Scottish [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) football club [Rangers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangers_F.C.) due to rival [Celtic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.)'s Irish roots. Set to the tune of ""[The John B. Sails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_John_B._Sails)"" popularised by [Carl Sandburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sandburg), the lyrics of the song make reference to the 1840s [Great Famine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_(Ireland\)) of Ireland. The song is often heard at loyalist marches in [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland) despite the [Great Famine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_(Ireland\)) being an event that impacted the whole of Ireland. The Famine Song has received criticism due to the sectarian nature of its lyrics and, in some cases, those singing it have received criminal convictions.

I think he has a role to play at our club now, and his role will become more important in the future as we make some inevitable changes.

I don't like him starting right now.  He doesn't make our play move quickly.  He has a very methodical approach to the game and while he's superb at controlling the tempo of the game, I think his tempo is a little slow for us when the game is starting in a lot of situations.  He's not a direct or incisive player and he doesn't help us transition quickly from defense to attack.  He's great at winning the ball and then retaining it for the team with his possession and short passing game for sure, but I think we need something more direct than him right now.  I'd rather it be Gerrard/Can/Lallana in the middle with Sterling as the forward at the moment (is he injured or something I missed?).  You can change Coutinho for Lallana if you want, but I think the extra energy of Lallana makes him a better fit when Gerrard is on the pitch.  If Sterling is out then I like Lallana as the AM and Coutinho as a runner so he can get more time on the ball.

I also think that once Gerrard is being phased out then Allen's role at the club will get bigger.  Gerrard is a direct player, and contradicts Allen's style.  I don't think they work very well together because they tend to bypass each other, leading to one or both of them getting caught in a weird position at times.  As our midfield changes from Gerrard as the central figure into whatever is next (the Lucas/Henderson/Allen midfield from last winter was saucy... lots of shorter passing but with great vertical movement to transition play, something you don't get nearly as much of with Gerrard involved) I think Allen will fit in a lot better.",0,1416688491,null,0,false,0,cma24a1,t3_2n3qzp,t1_cma24a1,t1_cma1t60,null,1425892846,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

false,shudders,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; But Manchester serves more airports directly in Scotland and rUK than Heathrow. It's also easier to get to than London (direct trains from Glasgow and Edinburgh).

Isn't that a reason to develop Heathrow then, because with development Heathrow could also serve Scotland better.

&gt; we start investing in cities other than London ... try a regional thing ala the North Rhine

We are. The Government have already begun plans for redeveloping Northern intercity rail connections to do just this.

&gt; A second hub of business and culture alongside London would be a boon for the UK as a whole rather than just the south east.

More money for the UK, regardless of where, is a boon for the UK as a whole. Heathrow needs developing because most of the UK's business is in London, so flying to Manchester is a waste of time. Yes the North should be developed also, but as I've said, that is already in the pipeline. There's no reason not to do both. In terms of time, the business already exists in the south-east so that should take preference because its an extant problem.

I would also guess the reason Heathrow / South East comes first is because its more profitable as a whole. In other words (and these numbers are fictitious to demonstrate my point), it will be something like £1 of south-eastern regeneration nets £3 for the economy, whereas £1 of northern regeneration nets £2 for the economy. If this is the case, it is cheaper for the UK as a whole in the long-term to invest in south-eastern regeneration firstly, then the rest of the UK thereafter.",0,1416688642,null,0,false,0,cma26o8,t3_2n38b2,t1_cma26o8,t1_cma1axo,null,1425892815,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

You're an atheist. I'm an atheist. In our world view we see the damage done by religions and think we'd be better off without all that. Fair enough.

Regarding the proposition 'The problem is people, not religion', if we look at it not from the perspective of someone defending religion but from logic we can see there's something to be said for the argument; religions don't choose people, people choose religions.

For all the talk of religions being memes or collections of memes the fact remains that at some point people make a concious choice to be religious or to not be. 

So our question then becomes, ""Why are people making these choices?""

People are how they are, a lot of them are not particular good at introspection and, in the absence of other answers, religion is very good at providing a one size fits all framework that allows them to not worry about the big picture.

Yet I was still asked questions such as: whether or not I had ""ever taken illegal drugs"" (why does this matter?), ""why didn't I try to hit him or scream for help"" ('because I wanted to live' was my answer), ""when did I last have consensual sex with him"" (we were engaged to be married...), ""why was I wearing no clothes"" (I was in bed, at home, going to sleep).  Would any of these things have made it ""not rape""? He forced himself on me, knowing I did not consent to sex, I begged him not to, surely that is enough?

He himself has mental health issues and is rather eccentric, and had a record of petty crime in his teens. If he'd been someone in a position of power, or had the presence of mind to come up with a lie, things likely would be very different... he made a full confession in the end, pleaded guilty as early as possible.

I'd like to say that I found the whole experience of reporting and going through statements and such to be extremely disheartening. Three police forces were involved and were terrible at sharing information with each other (and me); they lost evidence... then there's the courts. Delayed sentencing **5** times, twice due to an 'inadequate' psychiatric report; not taking what's called a ""Victim Impact Statement"" from me until I *asked* them about it having looked it up (a great failure on the part of the police); not asking me about a proposed restraining order until the morning of one given sentencing date... the whole thing has been a fiasco. I've lost faith in the police and the Crown Prosecution Service. If I were assaulted again, would I call them? I don't know.

Sorry. That turned into a rambling essay. I hope it makes some sense.

Edit: I forgot to say that, despite all of this, I'm happy that I live in a country where what happened IS a crime, and was treated as such, and I was not disbelieved at any point by the police.

Andy has no business starting a match anymore, as far as I'm concerned.  He can't shoot, and he has no pace.

Mauro should have started today.

Honestly, after seeing Vaz Te today, I'm inclined to think that Sam was correct in saying we needed another striker during the transfer window.  We need more people that can provide the kind of pace Sakho and Valencia bring to the table.  Speed is what's getting us a great deal of our goals. That, and our commitment to the attack -- which was missing today.  Andy doesn't have that killer instinct our other strikers do, and that worries me.  More than once I saw crosses sail right past him without so much as a nod in their direction from him.

We really missed Downing today.

The problem with yes-no referendums (as Scotland recently discovered) is that it oversimplifies the argument and doesn't allow for nuance in people's opinions.

IIRC one of the diagnostic criteria used to be actually having murdered someone, so you couldn't be formally diagnosed until you'd killed, as if killing caused the disorder instead of (sort-of) visa versa. But the idea of ""psychopaths in suits"" who never kill directly but who get into positions of power and cause far more damage than any serial killer has been recognised for decades.

[**EDIT**  Oops - the way I say that suggests that ""psychopath in suit"" exists as a diagnosis. AFAIK there's no official diagnosis specifically for this - I just meant the idea has been around and studied for quite some time.]

Research the going prices on eBay and Gumtree first; Gumtree users do, so don't be a fool and ask for more than eBayers are selling for. [EDIT] do this by watching similar items, but be aware of what I say about payment cycles below - things may be going for cheap at this time in the month.

Be wary of shit **scams** such as one I've posted below. Always get them to meet face to face. Offer to let them test it whilst in your presence so they trust you. Be very honest about any defects and upload pics of scratches or bumps. If you get an offer and arrange to meet someone, don't rely on it going through (I sold an iPad last week, some fella decided to call ten minutes after he was due to tell me he was drunk and 'can we sort it for another time?'), keep responding to other messages too. If you need the money urgently, mark the ad as 'urgent', but note that this increases the likelood of receiving absurd offers, such as 40% of the asking price (I sold a very old iPad last month too - some of the offers were a joke). However, feel free to reply to such idiots asking for a more reasonable offer, and they mostly do.


Gumtree's sorting facility is absolutely shit. Rather than paying for their premium services, delete your ad each day and post it again so it goes straight to the top. I monitored the views my ad had, and after around 12 hours, they completely stopped increasing. 

Do it soon. Monthly pay dates are usually from around 24th - 1st of each month, so people will have money for the next fortnight, and very little thereafter. In December money will only really be spent on Christmas presents, and unless your laptop is whizz-bang great and in immaculate condition, you don't stand much of a chance. Thereafter, in my experience, people don't really start spending money until February when they've paid off their Christmas credit card bills. 

If you get a text such as the below asking you to reply on email, ignore it. 

With Gumtree you get emails that hide the sender's email address, and when you respond to it, it hides yours. I shouldn't have replied to this idiot, but god damn it, I can't function before my fourth coffee.

**Scam**

I got a text at 7am; it came up with the name 'Steve' and because I'd asked FB mates if anyone wants to buy it the night before, I briefly thought it was a mate who lives in the Isle of Wight until my foggy morning brain settled. I'm going to screenshot the text and email because I don't give a shit if this person's personal info is out there, he/it/BOT is a scammer. The bad English should give it away really.

false,ppphhh,UnionFlag,CBF600N-Kent,"Since nobody has mentioned the obvious tips yet I'll list some. Go slowly. No faster than a cyclist, in general. Watch for angled wheels, or turning ones, since they're the people who're likely to move. Keep an eye on indicators but don't rely on them. Watch people's heads, they can be a clue. Watch for car-sized gaps people might lurch into. Be ready to brake always, and don't be afraid to beep at someone who moves. (Don't get into any fights over it, just let them know you're there.) Keep an eye on the road surface, a pothole might not throw you off but if it sends you six inches to the left you might hit a mirror. Make sure that if the lights change you're aware and can duck in somewhere, if there are no lights just keep an eye upwards so you see traffic start to move. Personally I keep the bike in a low gear so it's nice and noisy, but I still seem to startle a lot of people so I don't know how useful that really is. Try to give people a nod if they move over for you, it builds goodwill. If someone *doesn't* move, just be patient. 

There's a lot to watch out for but it comes naturally after a while, as with riding in general. Obviously only filter when you're sure you can get away with it, if a gap looks a bit iffy, it's not worth the risk.

false,ciaran036,null,null,"Honestly I think they are going in the right direction already by encouraging more people to use public transport, cycling and walking and improving the roads to better cater for buses and cyclists in and around the city centre. 

I think free park and ride schemes should be provided so that people in the outer and further areas from Belfast can drop off their cars at conveniently located car parks and then take buses for the remainder of the journey. 

In order to make the system work going forwards, they seriously need to lower the cost of using the buses and trains coming into Belfast as that's a big reason why many people are taking their cars instead, it works out cheaper and the links to/from the bus/train stations aren't great. There needs to be more free shuttle buses going to the key parts of the city where people go to work. Titanic Quarter is going to see increased numbers of workers going down there - they really need to provide free shuttle buses from the train/bus stations nearby. It's all well and good to be walking those routes or cycling during the summer months, but the rest of the time it's a miserable cold and wet trek. 

Also, I heard they are introducing bike hire schemes in Belfast soon (the so-called 'boris bikes' - the Barclays cycle hire system in London, much like the Citi bikes system in New York). 

Since Citi are increasing their workforce past the 2,000 people mark soon, it would actually be a great idea if they introduced the Citi bike hire system in Belfast as well, to provide an alternative option to the one the council is currently working on, perhaps to provide alternative routes and perhaps a bit of competition as well. Both schemes need to be extremely reasonably priced (perhaps even free, except perhaps a deposit for the cycle hire). 

For road users, there's honestly not a lot that can be done, not inexpensively anyway! There's just too many people coming into Belfast to work. I think Invest NI should be directing expanding companies to the smaller towns/cities around Northern Ireland, cities that are in much need of investment and jobs, and which don't have serious traffic problems (e.g. Derry/Londonderry). Derry/Londonderry has very good potential I think to expand - there is big potential for office space at Ebrington, still plenty of room beside the new Science Park down at Fort George and so on. There are plenty of other excellent sites in the other towns and cities around Northern Ireland for companies to expand into. Belfast will only see further strain if all the jobs keep coming here! University of Ulster need to keep their campuses at Jordanstown, Coleraine and Magee strong, instead of dialling things down in the regional campuses and dialling them up in the city centre campus. There are valid arguments for expanding the campus in the city centre, but that won't come without potential traffic problems and increasing the density of people living in the area.",0,1416699884,null,0,1416703327,0,cma70qs,t3_2n1wz7,t1_cma70qs,t3_2n1wz7,null,1425890543,2,false,Belfast,t5_2rc51,2

* Hashed markings? Go ahead. Solid line? Stick to your lane.
* Assume pedestrians have right of way at all times. People *WILL* walk in between traffic.
* Don't use the cycle lanes or ASL boxes (although I'll stick a front wheel in one just to let a car know I will be pulling off ahead of him)
* Never pass a [keep left](http://legacymedia.localworld.co.uk/275787/Article/images/18076084/4542050.jpg) sign on the right.
* If a car/van makes an effort (even a small movement), thank them with a quick wave or thumbs up.
* Bus lanes can only be used in certain cities, and [only if there is a sign](https://www.tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/images/bus-lane-signage.jpg) specifying you can.
* Avoid bus-lanes if the main lanes are free (Taxis and Busses = lots of diesel sunk into road). But then again, I always use them when commuting.
* Exercise extreme caution if filtering up to a roundabout. Avoid filtering to the front - drop in 5+ cars behind
* Make sure you're in a suitable gear. Don't filter up in third, ticking over. If the lights change, you'll need to get a shift on and you don't want to stall.
* Remember if you have panniers on, your bike is wider (whoops, sorry Mr. Bus)
* Avoid 'lane splitting'. I define lane splitting as 'filtering at high speeds'
* On a dual carriageway, filter down the middle
* On a motorway, filter down between lanes 2&amp;3. Don't filter between lane 3 and the median.
* Wear a helmet camera incase anyone hits you.
* White lines, road joins and cats-eyes can make you swerve. Avoid them.
* Be aware of other bikers sat in traffic whilst you are filtering. A few times I've had other bikers change their mind and want to filter, but don't perform their shoulder checks.
* Position your bike in clear view of the car's right-mirror. They will often see you and move in slightly.
* Do feel incredibly smug when you pass traffic.",0,1416700711,null,0,false,0,cma7do3,t3_2n3g08,t1_cma7do3,t3_2n3g08,null,1425890376,3,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,3

As a frequent flier, and being subject to transport options at both airports, having had a gander at the situation regarding both major London airports, it's become increasingly clear to me that it makes *no fucking sense whatsoever* to add another runway to Heathrow.

It's not just a bit silly, it's fucking crazy. The area is absolutely chokka, and the skies above it are full. When I fly into Gatwick, I just land. When I fly into Heathrow, 50% of the time I'm in a holding pattern, sometimes for up to half an hour.

Furthermore, though Heathrow is well served by the Tube, coaches and the extortionate train (which my company won't pay for so I don't take), travel into London from Gatwick is fast and if you choose right (direct train to Blackfriars or London Bridge) very cheap.

But actually they shouldn't be considering either Gatwick, Heathrow, or the madcap idea of Boris Island. A new feeder airport for London needs to be somewhere that has a lot of onward flights, and access to the Midlands or the North.

Which is a very expensive risk. Hopefully businesses will move there, but if it takes hundreds of billions worth of investment in improving airports, city infrastructure, regeneration and high speed rail linkages between cities, that's several decades wait.

There are a lot of flat shares to find.

Yeah, I can't really attack it on that grounds.

I think a much better line of attack is not that it's populist, but that it's not a policy. Or rather, well, it is a valid idea, but it's hardly some revolutionary policy that changes much, and just a few vague ideas like this don't make a complete manifesto.

false,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"To be fair, it would be pretty intimidating to have an adult giving your child pictures of people naked. That would be considered grooming. Anything which involves an adult deliberately showing sexual content to a child is far too close to grooming. 

However, if it's more passive, I really don't see the problem *as being specific to children*. There's not a problem with children seeing sexualised imagery. It's just sex. They'll be bombarded by it when they're older anyway and might as well learn to have an adult, and matter of fact perspective on it. It's part of life for adults. Let's not put it on some super special pedestal. 

I do think that the kind of ""journalism"" which goes into the creation of things like the Star, Sun, Mirror is subpar, though. I'm *not* saying we should ban it. I just feel that there is something a bit iffy about a national newspaper publishing a picture like that on it's front cover, but what can you do. It's just my christian sentimentality coming over. The problems of a free press is that they'll publish freely. Freedom isn't freedom unless it's free to do things which we don't necessarily like (such as offending our sensibilities).

*Edit*

I lost my original birth certificate on my 18th birthday at a pub. Didn't notice until I was at the bus stop and ran all the way back but the bar woman hadn't had it handed in. So I figured I might have lost it before the pub on a different bus and ended up going the ten miles into town to check in at lost property but there was nothing. 

I kept it hidden for 3 weeks from my parents, they kept asking for it back to put in the file and I told them that I'd left it with a mate so I didn't lose it. They must have known by the 3rd week though as when I came clean they didn't bat an eyelid. 

Found it again about 2 years later down the side of my bed when I was moving out.. Then lost it again on my last house move this year.

I am not sure where you stand on your rest days being cancelled. It would seem that the European Working Time Directive (which you have opted out of) is the main piece of legislation that protects your rest days.

(I'm trying really hard to avoid decision-theory jargon here.)  To be clear, it's not a put-down, it's a perfectly rational perspective and is often the best approach ... it's just a different evaluation scheme.  

I haven't forgotten Capoue's prior dominance either, but it doesn't weigh as heavily in my judgements.  Your selection is based on what Capoue has done in the past but isn't doing now (based on his performances in the PL); I'm more focused on what Stambouli hasn't done yet but might do (based on his performances in other competitions).  Objectively speaking, the expected value is probably the same, but we are each focusing on different things.

Regarding Kane and Soldado, I was referring more to our conversation a couple of months ago.  The current Kane-Soldado situation is not quite the same, though I think there is a related dynamic underlying our current evaluations of them.  

Neither has been indisputably better than the other, as the continuing debate on this sub makes obvious (though almost everyone agrees that both are preferable to Adebayor at this point).  

In the League, neither has seen much game time (though Soldado has seen more than Kane), so we're picking from scraps.  We did look particularly good with Soldado against City, which is the stiffest competition we've faced, and we haven't seen Kane against any team of that calibre.  

On the other hand, if we look across *all* competitions, we've mostly looked better and had more offensive production with Kane than with Soldado.  Also, on at least two occasions, Soldado has played 90' with Kane being subbed on -- both times, we instantly looked better with Kane on the field. 

So, with Soldado, it's mostly about what we've seen against City (and in preseason), and what he has done in the past in other top competitions.  With Kane, it's mainly about what we've seen in cup competitions, and what we think we could see in the future.  Both have strong possible upsides, but they're based on different premises.  Which one you or I or anyone else prefers is a matter of perspective and emphasis -- which is where we differ (and that's really all I was trying to say in my previous post).

**TL;DR**: I'm more focused on what we might see in the future, you seem to put more stock in what we have seen in the past.  Both are reasonable perspectives, but they do lead to different conclusions: I want to give Stambouli a go, you want to stick with Capoue.  I'm more excited about Kane, you have more faith in Soldado.  (To be fair, with Chadli injured, I'd like to see them play together.  I think we've actually looked our best with both of them on the pitch at the same time.)

Actually prior to the Falkland invasion the British Government was privately giving serious consideration to abandoning the islands. They were far away, of little value (this was before oil was discovered) and cost too much to protect. Argentina perceived, correctly, that the UK was weakening their claim of sovereignty but incorrectly believed that they wouldn't fight for the islands and so they invaded. 

However it's one thing to be considering returning the islands by choice and having them taken by force. The latter become a point of principle, pride and patriotism and so Thatcher had to respond by force. She couldn't political justify not doing so and besides it proved a good PR chance for her. Few in the UK would stomach having Argentina get a military victory over Britain even if they didn't give a flying toss about the islands. 

So now the question of the Falklands has become a point of national pride. People died in reclaiming those islands so giving them up is not in question.

They did everything necessary to patch up the damage (and NR and its staff should be praised for that) but they haven't fixed the bits that weren't damaged, or more importantly, they haven't built a new line to avoid the sea.

So there's a risk it'll happen next year if there's a storm. And even if there isn't, the sea spray often means that trains can only run on one of the two lines so there are delays and even slower speeds than normal. Further up the line you just have general disruption caused by flooding

It's ridiculous and the government currently isn't saying much about investment. I'm hoping they're leaving it until closer to the election to buy votes.

The beeching axe is another sore point, it removed an entirely separate rail line from north Cornwall to London (it got cut west of Exeter), and it's this line that is part of the ""plans"" to be reopened to build that Dawlish avoiding line. People who live in very north Cornwall have to get a bus to Exeter to get on the train.

One of the nearby towns also has a heritage railway, running between the station in the town itself to a tiny village and to the town's mainline rail station a few miles away (it's really in the middle of nowhere) - also donation and volunteer funded and quite nice.

&gt;EU111 European institutions must be designed with care and with mechanisms for correction, to prevent the drift towards centralism that has repeatedly been seen in history.

&gt;EU112 Part of the way to do this is to have a multiplicity of independent bodies with clearly defined areas of responsibility, and with the possibility of membership by different groups of nations and regions. An example is the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe for conflict resolution. (See Part 5)

Theatre industry isn't just commerical, and even highly successful professional groups take funding from the Arts Council.

London Philharmonia Orchestra gets about 2 million a year from the Arts Council and is one of the most recorded orchestras in the world. Also on the list are groups like the National Youth Theatre and Orchestra (who, whilst based in London, primarily work with people from across the UK and audition across the country to find people for their shows). On top of this you can see that the English National Ballet (6 million), English National Opera (17 million), English Stage Company (2 million) and the English Touring Opera (2 million) and Theatre (1 million) are all listed.

Also receiving funding are places such as the Southbank Centre are on the list (20 million), as are the Royal National Theatre (15-17 million), Royal Opera House (25-26 million), The Roundhouse (1-2 million). 

Most of these hire and work with professionals throughout the year pretty consistently. Some of them *are* professional companies. It's fairly obvious that the Arts Council does *not* just support amateur companies and amateur work, but also contributes significantly to the professional scene within London.

Even at commerical theatres (such as the Apollo Theatre), it isn't unusual to see companies performing there funded by the Arts Council to some extent. The Arts Council supports *every* level of culture within the country, which is why it's so good and why it's such a pain that funding is being cut time and time again, because it means producers have to stick to what they believe are safe money makers. Commerical pressures and all. I digress.

**If your figure ""per person"" is only measured by the population of those in the area, then the Opera House alone is going to be about £2.90 per person in the city (population 9 million or so) and we'd have to shut down Southbank and the National Theatre to ensure that we don't exceed £3.60/person.**

Moving on to discuss the effects of having this large theatre company:

The largest theatre industry in the world (and one of the largest performing arts industries) creates high levels of amateur companies around it because of the high number of trained professionals in and around the area, combined with the necessary industry infrastructure to support them.

Putting this simply: there is more amateur performing arts in London than anywhere else in the country. More companies, more groups, more amateur performances. If you include schools as well, you'll probably scale quite quickly out of control... and schools can and do use outside professionals where necessary and available. The greater support for connected arts (dancing as a part of musicals, for instance, especially further south and towards Brighton - one of the largest dance areas in the country outside of London) also means that there are more people who can participate in these things and more enthusiasm for doing these things. It's not a coincidence that most of the *national* amateur groups are based in London (and some of them are internationally recognised, like NYMT, as being at the top of their field in amateur productions). There aren't many other places where you get sufficient professionals (remember that support crew for theatre tend to be professional, even in amateur productions). Of course, national companies being based in London also means that the funding creeps into London even though 

The price of putting things on in London is more expensive because you tend to be competing (to some extent) with the professional theatres within travelling distance. This means working with London professionals (such as professional band members for musicals) rather than anyone else, which spikes the price.

I don't think that £3.60/person to £20/person seems unreasonable when you start to consider just how much more you'll be paying within the bounds of London and just how much more is demanded of companies that wish to perform in London. Also, people seem to do more in London compared to anywhere else: there's a lot more projects and performing arts programs within London. If it's measured per person *in the area*, then an area with a higher density of arts is going to naturally have a higher amount of expenditure per person, especially when every essentially every major national group and the vast majority of major theatres (many of whom seek funding or work with those with Arts Council funding) are all based in the area.",0,1416737505,null,0,false,0,cmajlc9,t3_2n38b2,t1_cmajlc9,t1_cmaj0wd,null,1425884562,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I was in a very dark place the first month I moved away, mostly because of my long distance relationship. I ended it, and I felt better as soon as I drove away (crying by the way, it was a very odd experience). Is their anything making you unhappy? If there is something of that sort, how can you change it, your mentality about it? Is it best to remove that thing from your life?

Those are things I like to keep in mind when I feel down and out. Sometimes you just really can't help it though, and as moonie said, you might just have to wallow in it till you feel better.

If the router is a typical residential router it'll be doing Wifi too, which means it knows which devices are connected to the wireless network and their MACs. It will also have an IP/MAC mapping so that it can communicate with any device on the network, and a DHCP lease table showing what addresses were handed out to whom. MAC addresses are indeed spoofable, but most users wouldn't know how to do that and IIRC iPhone/Android/OSX make it reasonably difficult

Then the router's NAT table can spit out the translations it is doing which would show what device (IP address) on the inside is connected to whatever IP on the external network.

So from there it wouldn't be difficult to piece it together and see that wifi device X is currently connected to IP address Y - although the NAT table won't show anything if the connection has been terminated.

It's not exactly a trivial task and the timing would be crucial (it would be useless for anything in the past), but it certainly isn't impossible if the ISP or an attacker has that much control over a router. It'd be even easier if NAT is not used

I'm not exactly sure what you're saying what's wrong with the OP's comment. ISP supplied routers can be programmed to give the ISP a fair amount of remote access - such as being able to reboot on demand and changing its configuration

A weakness of the data which springs to mind is that only those actually booked in for treatment count. If waiting for a first appointment patients would not be counted. There is no obvious reason however, to think this number had grown at the time.

I agree completely with you, but being awestruck at the beauty of maths is the same as being deeply moved by an art performance. In both examples you are the audience. The painter and the mathematician are both artists- both search for new meaning and when they find they *bring it back*. Whether it's a painter expressing ""love"" on a canvas or a quantum physicist expressing the relationship between two theoretical particles, both subjects are intangible and abstract. Look at the symbolic image of the atom, which required creativity to create from what are essentially numbers and formula. Richard Feynman *leaps* to mind, as does Carl Sagan, Newton, Einstein. All artists painting pictures of the forms and shapes they had seen in their data.

Sorry for rattling on, but my point is that scientists and artists are two sides of the same coin- both seek truth, both take mental journeys of study and both express how they see the world in a way that other non-artists may grasp. It saddens me that so many people see it as STEM vs Art.

You have large working class communities that relied heavily on low level industry jobs, like the shipyards, they never needed a formal education because they got apprenticeships and training on the job, connections from families and friends helped them get a foot in the door and they were set for life. When the industry jobs just died, and there was no investment in the area because well why would you, theses people had nothing left no culture or tradition of education and no prospects for the future. Its no secret that these jobs were mostly filled by protestants and its often said that when Republicans were in prison they hit the books while the loyalists hit the gym, and why wouldn't they, no one they knew ever needed an education, they needed to be strong to do their work education traditionally was of little use to them.

Now this is an issue with plenty of post industrial cities but those jobs aren't coming back, there is very little investment in that area and the vast majority of those jobs that are still here are home grown, the products that are still made here are first class but who's really going to invest in manual jobs here now, CNC and is far cheaper.

There are social problems as a result of this, general disenfranchisement of a lot of people, welfare costs, criminality and the paramilitaries are recruiting again, a generation has passed and they don't see where they fit now.

It doesn't take a degree in psychology to know that hiding the real world from children fucks them up.

&gt; Do you have any statistics that prove that kids in the 60's were perfectly able to deal with the same things? We treated these issues entirely differently in past decades, with many not getting any kind of assistance whatsoever.

And they didn't need it, because they weren't brought up to be traumatised by a glimpse of thigh.

&gt; Perhaps you should find a hobby, if Tesco adjusting their shelf space is really upsetting you.

Sophistry. It's not about bloody Tesco, it's about hiding stuff that your kids need to know about. I'm not talking upskirt pictures and sideboob. That's not all that's being hidden. The serious news stories are being hidden, too.

You can bet your bottom dollar those kids aren't allowed on the internet past the Cbeebies website and they're almost certainly not allowed to watch the news. The campaign wasn't simply to hide the naked ladies, it was to hide *anything* that might disturb the kids.

Let's look at what I remember from growing up in the 70's and 80's:

The 3-day-week

Callaghan's atrocious government (I don't recall the previous Wilson/Heath messes, thought I was alive for it)

the bread strikes

the Birmingham pub bombings

Thatcher's rise to power

The miners' strike

The Falklands war (my uncle served), including the General Belgrano incident as it happened

The Iranian embassy siege

The death of PC Fletcher, the abduction of Jamie Bulger, the Yorkshire Ripper...

Tienanmen Square

The Berlin Wall coming down and the end of the USSR...

All before I turned 20...

There's more, but you get the point - world shaping, important events in history that left me with a certain view of the world. There were a lot of good things, too and I'm not a complete cynic, but I've only listed the bad things. These parents would happily lead their children into childhood with a world view centred around Peppa Pig and In The Night Garden.

false,mediaboy,cnty-england,England,"&gt; You could relocate the Southbank or National Theatres to elsewhere in the country (or they could become touring) to redistribute spending on the Arts.

Southbank Centre and National Theatre both profit from the immense support structure for the Arts in London.

It isn't as simple as relocating a building or suggesting that they're touring. In London you also find the vast majority of self employed professionals in the Arts, and one theatre isn't going to provide them with enough work to live on, so they aren't going to shift, so that theatre is going to either drop in standards (less competition = standards drop) or lack the requisite support staff completely. I know a musician who lives and works in the North, and they still spend 3-4 months of every year in London working, because the pay is much better (richer area, ticket prices can be higher, more money to go around for everyone) and it supplements their poor income from playing elsewhere. On top of that, borrowing gear and finding specialists is much harder outside of London. Whilst there *are* facilities for this, they're not as comprehensive. Similarly, sourcing and maintaining equipment (especially specialist equipment, once more. Standard LX/SFX stuff would be easy to find, but things like Star Curtains aren't) is much harder when you aren't in an industry centre.

There are slow moves towards non-London areas (recording studios are springing up all over, for instance), but they are struggling. The world of Performing Arts is incredibly small outside of London: I have never worked with someone outside of London who hasn't worked with at least one other person that I've worked with before, and most of the time you can basically play bingo with crew + band calls until you've ticked off all the names around any given area. Getting *into* that kind of network is a nightmare in and of itself, and generally starts where work is most frequent and the most new people (mostly students) are starting up because of the education facilities, industry infrastructure and new groups willing to take a risk (and audiences willing to take a risk!): London. Where else *in the world* are there two dozen conservatories for various artforms within thirty minutes of each other? I could stand up from my computer and be at the Academy of Music within 45 minutes to meet some guy who wants me to play through his brand new contemporary musical that he's just written... and occasionally that's exactly what happens, complete with his mate (the director), his mate's best friend (who fancies himself a producer) and some girls they found on the internet (the choreographer and her friend who was bored). Where you don't have a wide enough pool of people to draw on, you can't get the same response: I get asked by friends in York if I can go up to that part of the world and do exactly the same thing because they sometimes struggle to find people willing to work with them rather than work *for* them.

Which is partly why exposure and tourism is also an issue. London is one of the biggest tourism centres in Europe and has the largest thoroughfare of theatre goers in the world (ahead of New York, I should note). Moving a theatre outside of London - where tourists *don't* often go, and *won't* often go for a variety of reasons (ties to London, poor public transport infrastructure outside of London, lack of time for extensive national travelling, etc.) - doesn't create an audience, though I'm unsure of the exact proportion of tourists that attend the National Theatre and SBC. Even if we are only to look at British visitors to theatres, there is no other place in the country with the same transport links for national access.

When I lived near Leicester, it wasn't unusual - if I had the money and time - for me to visit London for a concert, stay with a friend, have an afternoon in London and then travel back. Even schools across the Midlands and the South travelled to London to see shows because it's relatively convenient. I saw several plays at the Globe as part of my English lessons (two or three day trips). College/school trips to musicals were a yearly occurrence and used to plan out future school musicals by the staff as well as teaching points for prospective actors and musicians. I know that the drama students also attended various plays in London with some frequency. SBC is also popular with the London universities because of it's central location. Many of them use it for student showcases and other exposure-seeking events. The same can be said for other London (and southern) groups.

The question I would have to ask is: where would you move SBC/NT as to maintain the (relative) centrality and ease of access? Birmingham, as one of the central train hubs of the West Midlands, could perhaps be considered I suppose, but they already have plenty of theatres that aren't working at capacity. Perhaps Liverpool or Cardiff? They, of course, they are both well serviced already by a variety of theatres, and supported in art by the graduates and students of LIPA and RWCMD respectively, who provide both cheap technical support and an eager audience of students to buy tickets - it is notable that Liverpool and Cardiff both have substantial student-ticket programs in their theatres, as many of the London theatres do. It's worth noting that the existing theatres in Cardiff have already been slated for [cardiff council budget cuts](http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2014/02/cardiff-council-approves-cuts-sherman-cymru-new-theatre-st-davids-hall/) (which has already seen a direct effect by reducing the amount of programmed events at the relevant theatres) and many of the theatres are buckling their belts. Edinburgh could be an option, of course, but this (like Cardiff really) lacks any reasonably fast connection to the South and Scotland (and the North) is much less propserous than the South so the support for the industry (in terms of audience money being pumped into it) is going to be poor, so the professionals are going to be scarcer. Other than the Edinburgh Festival (and the Fringe), most people seem to stay further South.

Perhaps what says the most is that every industry professional I know (for music) outside of London has to teach to supplement their income. Those within London that I know teach only if they *want* to teach because they *can* find sufficient work with sufficient people to at least pay their rent and their bills, even if they occasionally go hungry.

It may be a bit of a catch-22, but there's no point investing money elsewhere because no one is going elsewhere because there's not enough money there to support us. Where would you locate a theatre that you'd be able to provide a sufficient industry boom to move enough people there to sustain a theatre? It would require a lot more money (which is, I gather, what the Arts Council has been saying for a long time in any case) and, I think, much better infrastructure. Which is coming: money is being pumped into the North to improve public transport which will, in turn, allow more people to get to a theatre located in any major city up there. The only question is whether it's time to try and boost the Arts elsewhere now, or if we need to wait a few more years. Given that the government doesn't seem to want to spend money on the Arts... I'm going to say that we need to wait a couple of years. The current system seems to suffice for those groups outside of London that need additional support (I've not heard of many groups being denied Arts Council funding, and most of those that were denied it were *somewhat* sketchy: directors ""losing"" sizeable amounts of equipment into their garage, expensive equipment being sold off or ""mislaid"" by trustees..) and should be supported further and new professional groups encouraged to try to move a little further up the trainline through subsidies and increased performance and rehearsal spaces.",0,1416747287,null,0,false,0,cmalbk4,t3_2n38b2,t1_cmalbk4,t1_cmakr24,null,1425883686,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

My personal opinion is the Heathrow option is fundamentally flawed. It's located on the wrong side of London! Not to mention all the other problems any development faces.

Sure. If they *catch* you in the act. But if you run away then no amount of CCTV review is going to identify you.

A *wiretap* is the equivalent of police ""stopping and searching"" you. And they must have reasonable suspicion to do this. But if you do something and the police come looking later why should they have records about everything you've done to make it easy for them to catch you?
