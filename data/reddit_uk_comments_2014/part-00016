signing costa would be good, but it would : 

1) We may lose Courtois , I am pretty sure he would be part of deal if ever it happend.
2) It would demoralize  Lukaku very very much (which I honestly dont want).
3) Also I find Costa to be like, he may bring the goals which we need, but he may well cause an unrest if hes not happy. He is angry young man and provokes others (I saw a video on that on youtube, couldnt get the link now).

Next season we can have 
Lukaku as our main man
Torres as a sub / secondary striker.
Ba if he stays.

Our squad IMO is complete after the signing of Matic, maybe Kurt Zouma (to replace terrry) and Shaw to replace Cole if cole doesnt renew / leaves CFC.

I love Lucas, he has no deficiencies,  stats prove he is best DM in the league, better than Yaya, better than Fenandhino, he is our most important player and not just because we don't have any other DM's.

If our team consisted of 10 Lucas' s and Luis Suarez we would be best team in the world. Lucas at CB is best CB. He must be worth 100 million pounds but nobody else can see that..... thank God!!!!

Barca, RM, Bayern, would love to add the rock that is Lucas to their teams. 

Make sure they don't see his stat sheet or they will be making crazy offers! Their scouts must be blind and that Scolari must be mad not to have Lucas' name first on Brazil's teamsheet. He would be their most important midfielder ffs

They would all likely be able to find one year (three term) contracts in schools, depending on your subject specialism. 

But as Engage seem to be set up for your circumstances, they're probably good to go with. Look on the TES messageboards and see if there are any mentions/opinions of them.

If you're planning on teaching in secondary schools in the UK, you'll have to expect behavioural problems at some point unfortunately. Although what you deem as ""a bunch of behavioural problems"" will likely depend on your prior experience. You might find a ""good school"" but it still might not be plain sailing. Inner-city schools may come with their particular challenges, but some find them the most rewarding to work in.

Find out what regions have jobs available and then you'll able to read particular school's Ofsted reports online, and get a slightly better idea of what to expect. Find out what catchment areas each of Engage's offices cover - for example, while Watford is in Hertfordshire, you may find they'll be mostly supplying London jobs.

Last time it seemed like the country was fed up with Labour and propping them up would not have gone down well. They would have been seen to have been ignoring the will of the voters, but they had pick between that the reaction they could expect if they aligned with the Conservatives. I'm sure they felt it was the lesser of two evils but perhaps they underestimated the strenth of feeling.

The Conservatives won a lot more seats than Labour too, would it have been right to have turned the loser into the victor? It would also have had practical implications. A Lab/Lib government would have had fewer seats and that might have made things a lot harder for them to get things done.

I can see things being different next time. I think there's a lot of buyers remorse with Cameron, although there always is with voters, and the Conservatives generally.

#***WARNING: ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK. SPOILERS BELOW!***


* Blink- This is just an amazing episode. The first time I watched it, it was in the middle of the night. I feared for my life. I mean, things that only kill you when you can't see them? Brilliant!
 

* The Girl In the Fireplace- Really tugs at the heartstrings! Coincidentally, i had a nasty speck in my eye the entire episode...

* The Eleventh Hour- Fish fingers and custard! I love this for being the beginning if the eleventh and amy pond! I just love how he told her to wait 5 minutes, and he came back 14 years later-__-

* Vincent and the Doctor- Mainly for the doctors line about how life is a pile of good things and bad things. The good things don't make the bad things any better, but the bad things don't make the good things any worse. 

* The Girl Who Waited- It was interesting to see Amy grow old waiting for the doctor, until she gave up hope. But that moment where they leave old Amy out was heart-breaking:'(

* Asylum of the Daleks- The beginning of Clara. I don't know why, but I always felt so sad for her when we found out she was a dalek. Her voice was heartbreaking. *I... AM NOT... A DALEK!*

* Midnight- Seeing the doctor so helpless was a strange sight indeed. I love how they kept the alien a mystery(exactly how they should've kept the angels:/)

* The Day of the Doctor- Seeing three doctors at once was FANTASTIC! The scenes with the Queen were especially hilarious! 

* The Time of the Doctor- This was a bittersweet episode. Seeing the doctor grow old brought a smile to my face. And the clothing projectors were pretty funny. The regeneration scene brought me to tears. Handles, come back!

* The Unicorn and the Wasp- Agatha Christie. Nothing more. Well maybe also that I've always loved mysteries. 

* The Waters of Mars- The doctors scene of insanity at the end really made me see him in a new light. He's not just a guy who constantly saves the universe, he has so much internal conflict you just want to run up and hug him!

* The Wedding of River Song- Just the strangeness of seeing all of history at once was so overwhelming! But finally seeing that the doctors does not die was awesome!


* The End Of Time- Mainly for the regeneration scene. Tennant was my favorite, and I didn't want him to go either! His goodbye with rose was so sweet. ""I bet you'll have a great year!"" But I didn't really like the master in there:/ I just didn't feel any other scene than the regeneration. But the Oods seemed nice. ""The universe shall sing you to sleep."" I love this line. The doctor has done everything for the universe, and it just put me over the edge.

There is not a unusually large amount of hate for anyone in this subreddit. If you feel like you're seeing it a lot it's probably sensitivity to it mixed with a little Confirmation bias. I do it to. Whenever I see people presume that episodes I like are bad (Like Love and Monsters or The Next Doctor) I feel like 'Man, why is everyone always crapping on these' But their Not. It's just that I'm tuned into that and it's like laser vision when it does happen. 


People use these ""Why all the hate for X"" posts when all they really want to do is talk about how much they like something, which is fine! But it's kind of a straw man thing to blow up a problem that isn't really there just so you can argue against it. 


There is overwhelming love for Matt Smith here. And David Tennant. And Christopher Eccleston. And Russ T Davies. And Stephen Moffat. And this proven because every time someone makes a post like this about how ""Everyone thinks X sucks, but I think it's great"" the comments that ALSO like X vastly outweigh the detractors.

* Not a ""prolific"" goal scorer by any standards - he manages a goal every 3 games.
* Just checked - he turns 31 at the end of the month.
* Seems like a cheap replacement for Defoe to add depth - if at all.
* He's similar to Soldado - except that he has some lovely long shots on him.
* Would be a good partner to have alongside Ade, but even if he's paired with Soldado - he could play the Ade role of feeding a final pass to Soldado for him to finish because he's very decent at good passes in the final third. Him and Eriksen would probably be able to make a good combo.
* I know I've mentioned the Soldado similarity, but he's another one of those who has a pretty much 100% shot accuracy from within the box.

What value does this have other than keeping prestigious cavalry regiments around?

The military budget looks like welfare because there is so much extraneous crap on there. If we ever did go to war the tank regiments would be immediately defunded and their men sent to retrain as infantry. At least the ones who weren't transferred to the engineers to take on minesweeping and such.

OTOH clear cut stuff we must have like drones are controversial. If war broke out with Russia 10 years from now the nation without drones will quickly lose air superiority. With the demands of war we will be pumping out thousands of drones and swamping manned airforces with sheer numbers. Drones being a lot cheaper than planes.

Fan belt needs tightening or replacing. 

&gt;Leaking + squeaking = not satisfactory quality.

Unfortunately a lot of older cars leak and squeak. Trying to find a leak in a car is sometimes a very mysterious journey, I had a Mazda 323 that leaked ( same thing, wet roof - that came later - and water on the floor + it would condense on the windows in the morning )   we changed every damn window and door seal and it still wouldn't go away. Damn mystery that one. 

&gt;Possible airbag malfunction. 

Does the airbag light come on periodically when you turn over the ignition? If the light does come on then your airbag is probably fine. FTR the light has to come on or it won't get through its next MOT and it probably won't have got through its last MOT. It won't get through its MOT with an airbag warning light fault either. This is a issue and can be a pretty expensive one to fix, sometimes more than the car is worth if it's an older car and you're talking about replacing the seatbelt sensors and/or a whole airbag. I had to scrap said Mazda for this. The garage that sold you the car must fix this or IMO they've sold you a duff that isn't road worthy and that's definitely a case for getting your money back.  It may however just need resetting. 

Edit: added bit on airbag warning light.

true,forgottenoldusername,eng-manchester,It is indeed grim up north.,"While she seems to be comparing the worst of state schools to the best of private schools, in some ways I agree.

If I had the money, I'd send my hypothetical children to a private school.

I had two good friends in my state school who were borderline failing, they both moved to a local private school and suddenly became A* students right up to A levels. Their work ethic didn't change really, it was the amount of effort and resources the school could offer. 

I personally wish I went to private school, though even if we had the money my mum wouldn't have let me.
I was however, lucky enough to go to a superb state school.
Bullying was very uncommon compared to the rest of the UK, worst I got was a pretend kicking in, which actually ended up in us all laughing together at hwo one of them kicked the floor and did his foot in, while we walked back to class.
The teachers on the whole were superb, the facilities were decent.

And having said that, some private schools are just money grabbing bastards!

I don't think those who went to private school are better if someone has 3 A* A levels when who gives a shit where it came from? 

I don't accept that sort of snobbery, but at the same time I don't buy into the other side who treat those who went to private school poorly. I have a friend who went to Eton, and he gets the piss taken out of him day in day out, gets called a snob, fat cat, daddies boy. The lot of it.

true,[deleted],null,null,"* Firstly the US isn't retiring the A-10, they have extended it's use for at least another 15 years, and will probably extend it again after that seeing how useful they are.

* Secondly you can't win a war with just jets and drones, you can win a battle, but in order to win a war you need boots on the ground, and tanks are a part of that formula. Tanks have been incredibly useful in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and we certainly wouldn't have done nearly as ""well"" as we have done in either country without them, but for different reasons. 

In Iraq they were instrumental in holding urban areas with lots of sectarian violence, due to the chance of random pot shots and IED's hitting our troops, they were useful for protection and to project an image of presence and power. 

In Afghanistan tanks were both useful for defending main operating bases and for operations at forward operating bases. Sometimes when a sniper is shooting at you from a random hillside it's useful to be able to turn the big guns on them and simply blow the hillside away. Calling an airstrike can take hours, by which time the Talibs are usually gone, and costs hundreds of thousands of pounds, for each bomb dropped. A tank is there, ready for action and primed, it can also carry troops, equipment and affords protection.

Tank corps were also the first troops over the border into Kosovo, [I'm sure you've all heard about James Blunt and his guitar strung to the side.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Blunt#Military_service) The point is that aircraft carriers still rule the sea despite submarines, and tanks still rule the land despite drones. If you are there with an aircraft carrier or a tank, it is a big ""fuck you"" to the enemy, you own that land, it is now yours.

Also, for every new threat such as drones and fighter aircraft, counter defences are developed to deal with them. Currently the British defence company BAE is developing a laser and rail gun based defence weapon which is both fixed and portable for aircraft carriers and tanks. This would make anything flying at less than near space altitude obsolete and easily shot down. A tank would be an ideal mobile platform for such a power hungry defence weapon.",0,1389954910,null,0,1389955386,0,cert941,t3_1vfn6r,t1_cert941,t1_cersq6p,null,1431981347,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

With regards to tanks. You need land forces, I've not said we should get rid of infantry. Tanks might well still prove useful against inferior enemies. I'm not sure that should be the focus of our military planning though. We could have beaten Afghanistan without any tanks.

I try to keep a civil tongue, even when presented with dross like this. I really, really do, but considering that my dad has just passed away, over a decade after my parents divorced, I feel the need to chime in here.
*Sir* Gerald Howarth can shove his comments up his fucking arse as far as I'm concerned.

My parents split up in 2000 when I was 10, and were divorced in 2003. My mother, my brother and I moved 70 miles up North when she met her new partner, and my Dad moved up as well, despite his career as a relatively high-ranking police officer in the Met. My dad broke his fucking back keeping his career going, commuting up to 160 miles a day for over a decade and did every possible thing he could to support my brother and I. He never took a single penny out of the state, and now he is being lumped in to the typical Tory bracketing as a 'dysfunctional separated parent' who needs to be judged and ostracised.

My dad was a model of a hard-working, morally correct man. He was heartbroken when my mother and him split up, and coupled with the stresses he endured in his job and the fact that he never did get over my mum, he took to drink. He was a hard-working policeman who gave everything to that job for the sake of a better country. He was commended for taking down a post office robber armed with a loaded gun on his own. He worked horrible cases including homicides, rapes, and everything in-between so this man can get up on his little stool and shout about how dysfunctional families should be frowned upon.

true,G_Morgan,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt; Also, for every new threat such as drones and fighter aircraft, counter defences are developed to deal with them. Currently the British defence company BAE is developing a laser and rail gun based defence weapon which is both fixed and portable for aircraft carriers and tanks. This would make anything flying at less than near space altitude obsolete and easily shot down. A tank would be an ideal mobile platform for such a power hungry defence weapon.

These technologies are useful but their impact is being exaggerated. A lot of these claims come about because the US can shoot down satellites. It is assumed that because a satellite is a long way away and moving fast that anything suborbital is dead. The truth is the key characteristic of satellites is they sit in a neat path that can be predicted down to the millimetre. Provided you can match that accuracy with a projectile they are quite easy to shoot down. 

Something atmospheric isn't going to move as predictably. The hard part is detection and tracking. It doesn't help that drones are:

1. A lot more stealthy than our stealth planes just because they are a lot smaller.

2. A lot faster and agile than manned planes because they won't kill a pilot if they suddenly pull 15g.

Let's see what this think tank has to say about themselves.  From [their FAQ](http://www.marriagefoundation.org.uk/Web/FAQ/Index.aspx):


&gt;Q: Are you trying to turn back the clock?

&gt;A: [...]People do still want to get married. In a 2007 IpsosMORI/Civitas survey of 1560 young people (aged 20-35) across the UK, 62 per cent of unmarried parents wanted to marry. **Young people want certain things in place before tying the knot: the top three being a partner to whom they want to commit, financial stability and home ownership.** The decline in marriage is a symptom of thwarted aspirations, not a rejection of the institution.

So they want financial stability and home ownership *before* they marry?  What good is pushing for more support *after* people are married in that case?  If young people are waiting for the right circumstances to get married then adding perks to marriage isn't going to make them get married any sooner.  If they do, then they're likely going to be worse prepared for marriage.

&gt;Q:  Isn’t it better to support parenting rather than marriage?

&gt;A: Quality of relationship does, of course, matter. And there will be long-lasting healthy co-habitations, and unhealthy marriages that break down quickly. But in supporting marriage we need to remember two vital points:


&gt;First, marriage is a proven route to stronger relationships and this is not just a result of a ‘selection effect’. 


&gt;**Secondly, quality of relationships alone doesn’t confer all protection and rights, nor give clarity as to public status. The public legal status of marriage is beneficial in and of itself, as well as a result to the quality of relationship that we believe it fosters and sustains.**

Acknowledging that relationship quality *is* a factor, independent of marital status, and still pushing for perks for married couples.  Rather than perks for *all* couples/parents.  Poor legal status for unmarried couples will be detrimental to quality of relationship, which they've identified as important in the previous question.  It certainly seems like it'd be something worth dedicating their time and effort to if their primary aim is to ""reduce the number of children caught up in the family justice system and the misery which they experience as a result"" (from the last faq question)",0,1389956650,null,0,1389957191,0,certhxp,t3_1vfrv1,t1_certhxp,t3_1vfrv1,null,1431981462,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The whole thing is a bit strange, there's definitely some shadey shit going down on the cops side of this whole thing. Another to add to the long list of police fuckery that has been happening in this country. This is from wikipedia:

Lawyers for the Duggan family argued that police had planted the handgun found on the scene.[137] Two witnesses testified that they saw a police officer move something from the minicab to the place where the gun was found, 20 feet away from Duggan's body.[138] One witness (""Miss J"") said she saw the officer pick up the gun, adding: “It will never leave me for the simple reason it’s not often you see a gun in broad daylight."" She said the officer ""had an expression like he’d found gold.""[139][140]
The driver of the minicab testified that he did not see a gun in Duggan's hand, nor did he see one fly through the air. He said Duggan was shot in the back.[141] Another witness said there was ""definitely"" a phone in Duggan's hand.[142][143] During the inquest Ian Stern, counsel for the police, suggested that the same witness - the only one to actually see Duggan being shot - had earlier told a journalist that he (Duggan) had been holding a handgun. The witness denied ever making such statements.[144]
""V53"", the officer who shot and killed Duggan, testified that Duggan was still holding a gun after both of the shots were fired, saying his eyes were ""glued to the gun."" Military surgeon Jonathan Clasper testified that it would be difficult to imagine Duggan throwing his gun 20 feet after being hit by the two shots.[145]
Near the end of the hearings, lawyer Leslie Thomas confronted the police officer ""V59"" with the possibility that a gun had been planted, saying: ""I'm going to suggest to you, V59, that you knew where the gun was before the officers had gone round (the fence), because you, and all of your colleagues had planted it there.” The officer replied: ""I did not plant any gun at any scene. I find that highly offensive.""[146] Thomas also accused officer ""W70"" of inconsistencies and omissions in testimony.[147]",0,1389957658,null,0,false,0,certnhr,t3_1vfqdi,t1_certnhr,t1_cert96s,null,1431981621,-33,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-33

The dissidents have noticed Haass proposals got the go ahead - ""ach well boys, time to stop the bombing campaign, sure this is the next best thing to the united Ireland we've been terrorising this province for since this American lad said flags are a crock of shite."" Well done Mr. Haass.

The Haass talks have very little chance of stopping the bomb threats. What it does do is show a united front towards dealing with recent instability by the power showering executive, which is necessary and not forthcoming as of now. I'm sure you can see the value of such a statement as interpreted by foreign direct investment (the Gov of NI will do its best to ensure business is unhindered by social unrest), especially so on NYE/NYD - which could have been quite the media coup for what has been thus far a rather insignificant experiment on behalf of Stormont.

&gt;As for protests, I'm sorry big lad but you're going to have to get used to it. People are angry for one reason or another even if that reason is stupid but we should live in a society where you are allowed to protest without a bunch of pinko liberal bigots demanding heads on sticks. Just in the same way you or I should be allowed to protest over something you feel strongly about. Also if you haven't noticed, the flag protests are hardly causing much disruption now...unless you're a melodramatic prick who gets worried by a few scores of loyalists standing about doing nothing of any importance while the other 99.9% of Belfast get's on with it's daily life. 

I didn't express any opinion about protests. What I did say was how this was being interpreted abroad by potential investors and the possible disruption to business operations - perceived or otherwise. It's still taken into account in risk assessment.

&gt;As for your last point the people of Northern Ireland should be demanding a referendum. That's how it should work - but people are so apathetic towards the process of peace here that instead they'll sit back and take the metaphorical Irish Nationalist cock to agree with whatever they agree with because ""sure, those unionist bigots disagree so it's probably right."" 

There's some projectionism going on here... In the other thread you were bemoaning peoples opinions of the DUP and now see fit to launch a tirade against Nationalism which plays no real part in this discussion we're having. I haven't once mentioned party politics (and I don't intend to). I believe NI is a country with too much history. I am not a 'community worker', so history does not put food on my table or keep the lights on. 

You should assume that attracting FDI and promoting a stable NI strengthens NI's position within the union moreso than saccharine loyalty to a few bandsmen. NI will likely not have a referendum on these topics, but what we will have are mandated elections, and with post-Troubles children reaching voting age I feel that a referendum on the merits of our politicians will be coming indirectly.

&gt;And it's not about pride it's about sovereignty. I will not have my province run by cooperate American/foreign interests. I will have my province run on the best interests of all people willing to engage in peaceful activity. Then maybe we can start talking about foreign 'interest.' If our decision are made only on the interests of cooperations and business then we're truly a broken society.

It is completely controlled by the [Taliban and other groups like the Haqqani Network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Emirate_of_Waziristan). Therefore any data coming out of there goes through their propaganda department and is likely to be twisted, inaccurate or largely made up. Therefore I am always suspicious of ""civillian"" casualties in Wazirstan. I'm sure there are genuinely innocent people there who have been killed, but the number pales in comparison to the number the Taliban have [killed in Afghanistan] (http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1p4b4k/marines_murdered_man_live_on_camera_court_martial/ccyta56). It isn't a numbers game, we should do better, but the fact remains that we actively try to avoid civilian casualties , the Taliban actively target them. I find it uncomfortable that certain liberal newspapers are more outraged at the accidents our military inccur, than they are at the idea of a Taliban government existing and all the fun things that would bring for the Afghan people, particularly women. 


Look:

If you accept the fact that war will occur (justly or not), it is a fact that a large portion of the time, we, or at least the Americans will be engaged in conflict. Mostly low-intensity counterinsurgency as that is what has constituted most conflicts since 1945. 

Now I believe, and I assume you agree that war should not be the default situation. We should always be striving to achieve a lasting peace. Therefore the tools we deploy in war should reflect that desire. Drones, tanks, civil action programmes, Hearts and minds operations, jets, JSOC, ground units, ships etc etc } all of them are tools which we deploy. 

However this deployment must be balanced with other considerations, we must try our best to obey the international laws we are signed up to. We must make each deployment of our tools proportionate to the threat posed, but we must also make it proportionate to the success that will be gained from doing so. 

I.E. We shouldn't drop cluster bombs, mines, or nuclear bombs because they are disproportionate to the threat and disproportionate to the success that would be gained. They also break international laws, and cause death and suffering long after the end of a conflict. 

Obviously the intentional targeting of civilians is outlawed by international law and is outlawed by most Western countries domestic law as well. However the accidental killing of civilians is an accident, it was not intentional, it is unfortunate and should involve recompense. 

However, wars, particularly modern wars rotate around the population. [Although the world is becoming less violent](http://nocamels.com/2012/12/mathematical-model-shows-the-world-is-becoming-less-violent/), the places where the world is violent are changing. They are not like the old Concert of Europe battles on the plains of France or Prussia where there are no civilians for miles. Modern warfare revolves around cities, around the support of the population. This increasingly puts civilians in the firing line, not in the sights, but in the firing line. 

Therefore civilian casualties are inevitable in a modern conflict simply as a result of where the conflict is. We can take as many steps as we can to reduce this. You might not know this, but Israel has actually pioneering many tactics and operational techniques that have significantly reduced the number of civilian deaths in their operations in the West Bank. This has included the use of drones.

If you don't believe me, look at the number of civilian casualties in the Second Chechen war (Russia trying to control a rebellious Islamic insurgency in a province it sort of controls), compared to Operation Defensive Shield (Israel trying to control a rebellious Islamist insurgency in a province it sort of controls). 

I’m not going to argue drones were instrumental to Israel’s success, but they certainly helped. And this also demonstrates a further point. Drones helped end the conflict quickly. The Second Chechen War essentially ended in 2009, Operation Defensive Shield ended in 3 months. Chechen civilians had to experience nine years of conflict. Both operations didn’t destroy the insurgencies, both still operate in the Caucasus and Palestine. Yet one operation ended very quickly, which massively reduced the period of war, which massively reduces the period in which civilians are at risk. If you can end a war quickly, although some civilians may die, prolonging the war will also mean civilians die. 

Now drones are undeniably an effective tool. You cannot deny that having an unmanned air vehicle, which puts none of your own troops at risk, is a massive advantage from a tactical point of view. 

Now I assume the war is just - if you disagree with the war being just then your problem is to do with the war, not the drones. But even if the war wasn’t just, your priority should still be to end it as quickly as possible. You can’t just pull out, otherwise you are knowingly putting the population at huge risk of massacres. You can’t pull out because civilians are dying, knowing that when you pull out, far more civilians are going to die. You utilise all measures which force the opposing side to an negotiating table. If that includes a possibility of a few civilians dying, it is unfortunate, but so be it, because if that doesn’t happen then way more civilians are definitely going to die.

Drones help answer that dilemma. Civilians may die yes, but civilians die in war, that is an unavoidable fact. It may seem avoidable looking at the individual circumstances in which civilians die, but if you look at war as a general thing, it is obviously inevitable that at some point, someone will fuck up, one bit of intelligence will be wrong, a group of insurgent leaders will be travelling on a bus. But drones are an effective tool, which therefore improves our ability to discriminate civilian and military targets (not perfectly, but far far more than the Russian minefields in Chechnya did). And furthermore, being an effective tool, they will help bring the war to an end sooner, reducing the period of risk massively. 


You cannot let the chance of civilians dying be trump card that cancels out any benefit to an operation. It sucks, but if you did that, all you are going to do is encourage the insurgent group to use human shields, to surround their meetings with civilians, to meet and operate in urban areas. You would be encouraging civilians to be put at more risk than they were before. Therefore you must show that you are willing to incur the cost of civilian casualties to prevent that, which encourages the insurgents to rethink their tactics and move away from civilian areas to other means. 

The valid questions about drones are not their deployment, but how and where they are deployed. Their use in war adheres to international conventions (their use in areas which are not at war is more controversial but can still be in the end necessary). I have already described why I don’t believe they dehumanise conflict to a great enough extent that it should impair their use.

true,notsurewhatdayitis,eng-yorkshire,East Yorkshire,"As a new driver you need a DCPC. You cannot work as a LGV driver without one. This is 35hrs of training which includes two required modules and the rest electives. 

So in order of what you do:

1) Get the provisional and get a medical. You will have to pay for a medical. [Prices vary wildly](http://www.trucknetuk.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=19955) and the good news is you do not have to use your own GP so shop around.

2) Do the driver training and theory test and get the test passed.

3) Only when you've passed the test then do the DCPC. No point paying for the DCPC if you fail your test and can't afford to continue and pass. The DCPC should cover tachos and drivers hours. Make sure you choose modules which cover loading.

As newly qualified driver its going to be hard to find work. There's a lot of very experienced drivers with decades and hundreds of thousands if not millions of miles experience you'll be up against. Employment agencies are actually a good way in. You'll get a wide range of experience in a short amount of time without the pressure that fulltime employed drivers have as it is expected agency drivers are crap. Ask lots of questions and carry a notepad. Better to ask than try and wing it and make a complete arse of the job. Going down the wrong road in a 44 tonne artic can be a lot more problematic than in a car - I once had to reverse a mile back down a road with help from the police when I came across a low bridge where the signs had been nicked by pikeys.

Trucknet UK is a mine of information. [Here's the link to the new and wannabe drivers forum.](http://www.trucknetuk.com/phpBB/viewforum.php?f=5)

I would just like to make this point before you embark on spending £3-4000 on a license and training....

The hours are long. 8hr a day fixed hour jobs are very rare. Your average working week is going to be around 55hrs and the longest it can be is 84hrs. 15hrs is the longest you can work in a day and if you legally can you will be expected to if needed, only getting 9hrs off before starting work again. 3-4am starts are common as most first drops are timed for the time businesses you deliver at open so if the builders merchant you're delivering to opens at 8am and you are booked for that and its 4hrs away you'll be starting at 3.30am. When the weather is shit and the police are advising motorists not to go out you'll still be expected to. The only part of the job you can guarantee is your start time. From then on its a crap shoot. Most truck drivers learn not to plan things for after work because as soon as you do the day turns to shit and you miss it.",0,1389960512,null,0,1389960790,0,ceru3us,t3_1vbb89,t1_ceru3us,t3_1vbb89,null,1431981835,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

So much of the argument around this case is because number two *seems* to contradict the other two. But it doesn't.

I am proud to be the manager of Tottenham. Yeah, it's going to take some getting used to, but, I think I am on my way to getting used to it.

All I ever demanded as a player was honesty from the manager. They aren't going to like you when they aren't playing and I didn't like my managers when I was left out. But, they can respect you still, and, it's fine to have a laugh and a joke with the players, but, when it comes match day they got to know who the boss is. I think Kenny Dalgliesh, who managed me at Blackburn was best at that. He was down with the boys, we could have a laugh and a joke with him, we ate together and prematch we would always stay together. But, when it was time for business we knew who the boss was. I'm convinced I can do this job.

Yeah absolutely, but I'm not trying to contrast Andre, Andre has done a good job at this football club.

I like defenders to be responsible at the right times. I don't buy into formations too much, players win football matches, not formations. I think that is where I try and put my point across to the players, it's not about how we set you out on the board or on the TV screen, it's about what we are asking you to do on the field of play.

&gt;Adebayor, has had a lot said about him. How have you made that connection?

It was an easy transition for me, he wasn't being considered and he was out of the picture. He is a top striker, motivation was obviously going to be there just by putting him in the side. I think he is a freak of nature when it comes to his fitness and capabilities. Anyone can see just by looking at him that he carries no weight, what he has got is a huge heart under that chest and a desire to play football at the moment. Long may it continue.

[Cuts to scenes from win against United at OT]

We need a level of consistency and we need to be in and around challenging for champions league, every single year. I think over the last 4 or 5 years that has happened at this football club and we need to continue that. We need to go the extra step though, we need to compete with the Liverpools and the Evertons of the world who have now come into the frame and really are challenging. So, it is getting tougher to reach the top 4, but we're not phased by the challenge ahead of us. You can only really point to results, you know, people from the outside only see results. Because, I don't like to insult peoples intelligence and say, ""You know, we aren't getting results, but I am improving this one and that one"", it counts for nothing. The fans don't want to hear that, what they want to see is where you are in the league, are you getting a result, are you scoring enough goals, are you entertaining us.

&gt;

&gt;**Fuck** is an English-language word, a profanity which refers to the act of sexual intercourse and is also often used to denote disdain or as an intensifier.

&gt;The origin of the word is obscure. It is usually considered to be first attested to around 1475, but it may be considerably older. In modern usage, fuck and its derivatives (such as fucker and fucking) can be used in the position of a noun, a verb, an adjective or an adverb. There are many common phrases which make use of the word, as well as a number of compounds incorporating it, such as motherfucker.

The article posted isn't about the cycle of violence, it's about spending on a military when there's no obvious enemy:

&gt;I occasionally attend defence seminars to immerse myself in exotic surrealism. A recent one comprised soldiers, thinktankers and arms suppliers, all living off the public purse. They were like Macbeth's witches, incanting: ""By the pricking of my thumbs / Something wicked this way comes,"" before stirring quantities of money into their budgetary brew. ""Thrice to thine and thrice to mine / And thrice again, to make up nine,"" they chant, the nine being billions, not millions.

&gt;No one at these events ever talks about who is being defended against whom. We are just warned that if the defence lobby does not get its money, ""capabilities will degenerate"" and allies desert. Assorted ""wars"", on terror, drugs, human traffickers or whatever will be lost and unmentionable horrors result. The Ministry of Defence is like Benefits Street for slow learners.

It's more fundamental than issues with the current situation. Now I agree that there's probably a cycle of violence at play with intervening in the Middle East. We're quite possibly just creating new terrorists, although it's hard to see where we could get evidence for such claims. But the issue is that slashing the military budget to the hilt just because we don't presently have anyone threatening us is extremely short sighted for two reasons:

1. You can't predict where the next threat will come from.

2. By lowering are guard we're quite possibly inviting further threats. For example against British Overseas Territories.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Duggan had been arrested for, but never convicted of murder/attempted murder. In fact, his official criminal record isn't *that* spectacular. Cannabis possession and handling of stolen goods. That's it. Those are the crimes of this crime lord.

Yet...he was somehow [one of Europes most feared and violent criminals](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/mark-duggan-among-europes-most-feared-and-violent-criminals-before-his-death-sparked-the-2011-riots-8835363.html). Evidence suggests he was on the way to a [drug deal](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/01/mark-duggan-shooting-drugs-deal) and this is why he bought a gun. No evidence exists that he was on his way to a murder.

Duggan was a criminal. A bad man.

But...his guilt, via the press and third hand evidence, not an actual court that tried him, is clear to all. He is a gangster. A drug dealer. A potential killer. All accepted, none of it official. None of it anything he was ever convicted of.

But, even I, believe he was a nasty piece of work and I'd have avoided him like the plague. But here is what bothers me, and it goes beyond his shooting. With a man so clearly guilty, with a man so bang to rights and obviously dislikable, with a police force that did everything right and a press simply reporting the news impartially...why all the revision? Why the clear lies and multiple stories and misinformation? Why is any of that necessary? And more troubling, simply because Duggan was a villain, why is that okay with so many of you? Why are so many extremely quick to brush away the anomalies being highlighted as if people want a statue of Duggan on the spare plinth in Trafalgar Square?

I have no love for the man. It's guys like him, as a relatively bookish black man who had to grow up on rough estates in South London in the 80's/90's trying to avoid the drugs, violence and gangs, that I spent my life fearing the most. It's guys like him that undermine my efforts to be a productive law abiding member of society as some simply will always view my skin colour as a marker of criminality. The less Duggan's in the world the better as far as I'm concerned.

**BUT**...do I want a police force that answer to no one as long as you don't like their targets? Do I want a press that will bend the truth to fit a certain narrative, whether for greed or more malicious intent? Do I want a toothless process of investigating these accusations that serves no one but those it's charged to scrutinise? No. Duggan being a gangster is no excuse for some of the things some of you are willing to let slide.

The impunity to kill a man one week, the feeling of invincibility when possibly legitimate concerns are brushed under the carpet because you all decide the police and the justice system are without fault because you hate the person complaining is what leads to the hubris to snatch your camera when they have no right, or break up a student protest with batons or pepper spray, or spy on students, or lock up students for downloading materials they don't like...basically any number of transgressions against people who don't look like Mark Duggan but look a little more like you.

Allen has been quite good when fit, though he needs to step up more to justify his price tag. Overall, glad to have him in the squad

Assaidi might not cut it for us, but he only cost like 1.5million, which is a worthwhile gamble for a young talent that might still come good.

Cissokho has ben pretty bad at times, but he is only a loanee, so it's not that bad

Sakho looks to be a beast that could easily give years of good service

Kolo is a great, experienced player to have in the squad as a player and an example to the youth.also free.

Moses hasn't quite panned out, but again, it's only a loan.

I think the British people would sacrifice a 9.7% say in how their country was run, for a 100% say in how their country was run.

&gt;You wouldn't make the case for independence for Norfolk only on the basis that they have 9 out of 650 MPs

The difference being of course being that Norfolk has never been an independent state, and is incapable of supporting itself.

""But technically, neither can the UK!"" I hear you cry. Well, no we can't. But we can trade, as we have done for centuries. You do not have surrender sovereignty to another nation, just because they have a resource you need.

The second reason why your Norfolk analogy is utterly inappropriate, is that people from Norfolk do not have a pathological inferiority complex when it comes to the rest of the UK. Norfolk residents to not have a history of being repeatedly undermined by Lincolnshire when attempting to integrate into the UK, Lincolnshire did not sell weapons to an enemy Norfolk was currently fighting. (Here I am comparing Norfolk and Lincolnshire to the UK and France, respectively).

The fact of the matter, is that the UK is hated on a fairly base level by many EU residents. This is because of our perceived 'arrogance', which as far as I can tell extends to us not wanting to join a now virtually defunct currency with which Germany runs Europe.

I do not support the surrender of sovereignty on the basis that the EU will ""protect us from our government"". We control our government 100% and have the strongest democratic tradition in Europe.

true,keizersozei,flair5,,"I think there are parallels between AVB's and Ramos's appointments with us. Both seemed liked long term investments due to the way they came in, and the funds they were given to buy lots of players in their first or 2nd transfer windows. It seems as if Levy wants this template of manager to be our future. Academic, scientific, systematic. It's no secret that he wants Spurs to have a Wenger type of manager. Ramos didn't work out because he kept on loosing. I'm still not 100% sure about why AVB went - I think there is something behind the scenes that we as fans just won't ever find out about. 

I think in contrast, the Redknapp and Sherwood appointments have been the temporary stop gaps. Harry worked out quite well so stayed for a bit longer. Sherwood I'm still not sold on. It's impossible to tell when you're still in that honeymoon period with a manager. 

Long winded way of saying: I'm sure Levy is/has been looking for long term appointments, but they haven't worked out. The prem is less forgiving these days, so if a manager isn't working out, you need a replacement who is different. Not just a different man, but a different style.

 [***Rectal prolapse***](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectal%20prolapse) : 

---

&gt;

&gt;**Rectal prolapse** (rectal procidentia) refers to a medical condition where a section of the wall of the rectum prolapses (falls down) from the normal anatomical position with associated pelvic floor dysfunction. This may occur while straining to defecate, or during rest.

&gt;Used unqualified, the term rectal prolapse often is used synonymously with **complete rectal prolapse** (external rectal prolapse), where the rectal walls have prolapsed to a degree where they protrude out the anus and are visible outside the body. However, most researchers agree that there are 3 to 5 different types of rectal prolapse, depending on if the prolapsed section is visible externally, and if the full or only partial thickness of the rectal wall is involved.

&gt;Rectal prolapse may occur without any symptoms, but depending upon the nature of the prolapse there may be mucous discharge (mucus coming from the anus), rectal bleeding, degrees of fecal incontinence and obstructed defecation symptoms.

None of us were there, so none of us can possibly claim with any certainty whether or not the cyclist should or shouldn't have been in the road position that he was. He is the only one who can make that judgement and it is meaningless for you or I to say what he should or shouldn't have been doing.

The only thing that anyone can conclude with certainty is that the moped overtook on the left, which is a huge no-no according to the rules of the road. And he also attempted to physically kick the cyclist before zooming off to escape the consequences of his actions.

We're looking at blurry, shaky cam footage so it's impossible to tell the condition of the road from the video. The only people who can decide if the gutter is safe or not is the cyclist at the time.

Furthermore, consider that perhaps the camera is fixed to the right side of the cyclist's helmet or shoulder, which would make it seem like he is further to the right than he really was. Or perhaps the camera was on the left, meaning he was actually way over to the right. We have no idea.

The moped overtaking on the left is no indicator of whether there was much space on the left or not. Physically, a moped can fit in between a 2 foot gap, but you wouldn't do that at 20mph. Camera wasn't pointing to the left so we can't tell how much space he left when undertaking. It could have been 2 ft, it could have been 6 ft. The gutter may have been extremely potholed, and the moped rider was just happy to subject his vehicle to the potholes regardless of the danger, simply to make a point. Or maybe it was completely smooth and the cyclist was being over-cautious.

My point is that we could never know for sure unless we were there, so we should all just chill out and stop asserting whether he was being safe or being annoying.

The only thing we can know for sure and agree on is that the moped rider assaulted him physically, and it could easily have ended up with a fatality if another truck was overtaking on the right.",0,1389972798,null,0,1389973046,0,cerxkqa,t3_1vfsp8,t1_cerxkqa,t1_ceruv1l,null,1431983461,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

I second [The Anderson](http://www.theanderson.co.uk/) in Fortrose, if you can get there. Jim is a great guy, his wife's cooking is amazing, fresh, and local. There are many many beers to choose from and 180 whiskies. His wine cellar is good, too. The rooms upstairs are comfy, so if you have a chance to stay the night... I highly recommend it. I had my wedding reception there. 

In Inverness town, I definitely recommend [Hootenanny](http://www.hootanannyinverness.co.uk/). Especially if there's a nice wee music sesh going on. It's a favourite place for locals. 

Also, [The Castle Tavern](http://www.castletavern.net/). Castle Tavern does the Cromarty Brewery ales, and Hoots does the Black Isle Brewery ales. 

I disagree with /u/daeedorian about the Black Isle Brewery ales. There are about 6 regular ones from a blonde to a porter, so maybe they had one that they just didn't like. I'm particularly fond of the Red Kite and the Heather Honey. On Castle Street right across from the castle is a specialist [shop](http://liquoricebeer.com/) selling hundreds of beers and ales, and they stock most of the ones from all around Scotland. 

For excellent pub food (with a french twist) and atmosphere, try [Nico's](http://www.theinvernessrestaurant.co.uk/inverness_restaurant/menu.htm) and [The Waterside](http://www.thewatersideinverness.co.uk/restaurant.php#.UtlOOWTFKPQ) is nice, too.  

On the other side of the Ness from The Waterside is [Eden Court](https://www.eden-court.co.uk/). It's always worth seeing what's on there. 

Finally, if you have time to get out of inverness, try to! The Highlands are stunning. My top tip is to take a day trip via train to the Kyle of Lochalsh. Trains leave from Inverness and travel west through some of the most stunning scenery in the Highlands. You'll have a short time to walk about in Kyle and then hop on the train back. Take a picnic for the train and a couple of bottle of ale... and you're set for a great day out. Likewise, if you get a car and are comfortable with driving in the UK, head on a day trip to Ullapool or Gairloch. Eat fresh seafood and catch some music at The Ceilidh Place. 

I hope you have fun and really enjoy your time in Scotland. If I were going to be home.... I'd definitely see you at Hoots for a pint. :) ",0,1389973379,null,0,false,0,cerxth3,t3_1ve6p2,t1_cerxth3,t3_1ve6p2,null,1431983576,4,false,inverness,t5_2s9vh,4

Lewis Holtby is thought to be eyeing a move back to Schalke after finding himself out of favour under the new head coach, while Etienne Capoue is rumoured to be a target for Napoli.



The noises coming out of Nacer Chadli’s camp suggest that the Belgian is also concerned about his lack of first-team opportunities as he looks ahead to the summer’s World Cup – and Sherwood concedes there may be departures during this transfer window.

“Am I prepared to see people go? Yes absolutely,” he said. “As long as they’re the right players and the ones that I don’t want to take us forward, then I’m happy. 

“You can only go with a certain amount of players. Obviously the pressure’s on because it’s a World Cup year for a lot of these players - it’s important that they’re playing. 

“We can’t guarantee that they’re going to get maximum game time, but we certainly won’t be leaving ourselves short. If no-one left I wouldn’t be shedding any tears over that either.

“My priority is to keep us as strong and competitive as possible, and I wouldn’t be making any decisions based on any national team.”

Sherwood is not aware of any imminent deals, but he concedes he has held discussions with technical director Franco Baldini regarding the players he can do without.

“There’s no movement as far as I’m concerned,” said the head coach. “I think Franco might be working in the background regarding a lot of transfers.

“I’ve heard nothing concrete regarding Etienne Capoue or any other players. The only one is Ryan Fredericks, who has gone on loan to Millwall this morning.

“I’ve had discussions [with Baldini], yes, but it’s sometimes a case of supply and demand – and there are guys that I’m still getting used to and getting to know. 

“I’ve got a certain amount of trust in other players before some others, but the longer I’m with them on the training field the more I’m getting to know them and the more I’m getting attached to some of the new players as well.”

Sherwood added: “[Capoue] is a new player and he’s obviously one that I’ve read a lot of speculation about. All I can say with regards to Etienne Capoue is that he’s never caused me a minute’s problem here. We have a good relationship. 

“He realises that I’ve used Nabil Bentaleb in front of him – not only him but Lewis Holtby and a few other players in the midfield area - because I knew the young boy and I trusted him. 

“Etienne has played, he played at Old Trafford, and he’s been asked to play in reserve games to keep up his fitness, along with other players, and they’ve done that and have never caused me a minute’s problem. 

“It’s not been an issue between us. The fact is I’m still getting to know some of these new players and I know the other ones better.”

While it is likely that players will exit White Hart Lane before the end of the month, Sherwood is not expecting any arrivals.

“Not at the moment, no,” he said. “It looks to me like we have had four or five new signings [this week] because it’s the first time I’ve seen four or five of them on the training field. 

“Not a lot of clubs have spent the money we spent over the summer, so it’s very difficult to find quality in January which is going to strengthen you. 

“But if we had an epidemic between now and the end of the window we could look. We are generally looking but we are not actively trying to sign anyone.”

It's not victim blaming it's defensive cycling.

true,GratefullyGodless,tennant,Tennant,"   I think you have unrealistic expectations for character depth in an adventure show. Remember, first and foremost, Doctor Who is and always has been an adventure show. Expecting great depths of character in a show like Doctor Who is expecting too much for a story that has to resolve itself by the end of the hour, or two if a multi-parter.

   Don't get me wrong, you still want interesting characters, but they have to be interesting on an economy of scale. You only have so much time in the episode to spend on plumming the depths of a character, so most writers have to use shorthand, stereotypes, and stock characters.  But, despite that, the characters on Doctor Who still tend to be more interesting than the characters on many other sci-fi/fantasy shows or movies.

   You think the women characters on Doctor Who are one-dimensional? Try watching the re-boot Star Trek movies, Star Wars, or just about any action movie of...well...ever. Compared to most adventure movies and shows, the women of Doctor Who are great wells of depth, not the shallow pools prevalent in most sci-fi/fantasy media.

As you know that's a very difficult question to answer. If there's a genuine threat to your life, from armed men (Like ex-RUC men here) then you should be allowed to carry a gun for protection. If you're paranoid and believe the media like the DailyMail and think you are going to get mugged by an escaped prisoner every time you leave the house, then no way, guns should be kept away from that type of person at all costs.

Everyone agrees with that. Or at least anyone with half a functioning brain _should_ agree with that.

Driving/cycling/riding safe is about being defensive in my opinion. That means acknowledging there are arseholes out there and modifying your behavior to minimize the risk to yourself.

My route home takes me along commercial road and I cycle in the bus lane. That means I have to compete with a shit load of mopeds/motorbikes. They just don't give a fuck and will zoom past me doing twice the speed, if I right on the outside they will zoom past me on the inside. So I ride on the inside with enough gap away from the kerb that I feel safe so that if they are going to overtake they will do so on the outside.

The guy in this video was cycling so far to the right that he opened up a huge bap for this arsehole to come up the inside. It's not right, it's fucked up. But knowing that this cyclists might want to consider not riding so far to the right in future, it really is unnecessary. And this is coming from someone who does around 2000 miles a year on my bike and have done since I got my first bike in 2006 and I will hog the lane like nobody else when I need to.

Wow... what a sinister comment. So, we should just ""get used"" to these protests even it's over something silly? (Your words!). Even if they cost the taxpayer MILLIONS of pounds? Millions of pounds that could open schools or the City A&amp;E? 

You're clearly a Flegger sympathiser, despite recognising the issue is ""silly"". What gives?

&gt;  you are allowed to protest without a bunch of pinko liberal bigots demanding heads on sticks.

This doesn't even make sense. You offer the term 'Liberal' as a derogatory slur, I'm very proud to be liberal, it's beyond the grasp of reasoning why anyone would want to be conservative. You do know protest is a very much a liberal institution - miner strikes? Occupy? Greenpeace? Water Aid? 

&gt;  Just in the same way you or I should be allowed to protest over something you feel strongly about.

Perhaps I feel very strongly that all Indonesian boys under the age of 7 should be executed. Can I protest about that? I guess I can but it's fucking ridiculous and should be given no credence whatsover. Flag protesters shouldn't be given any merit and they certainly shouldn't have an American coming over to negotiate with them.

&gt; Also if you haven't noticed, the flag protests are hardly causing much disruption now...unless you're a melodramatic prick who gets worried by a few scores of loyalists standing about doing nothing of any importance while the other 99.9%

This one is hilarious. They aren't doing any harm so leave them be. Let's forget about the businesses they closed, the millions of pounds they wasted and the irreperable damage done to the reputation of Belfast. Better yet, now that they've fizzled down to fuck all but 20 facists with Isreal flags and e-ciggarettes, we'll allow their cause to halt progress to Northern Ireland as a society and an economy.

I see them every Saturday in Belfast. And they annoy the fuck out of me! I've had visitors from other countries ask me what they are doing. I've had visitors from England, the most British country in the world, ask me what they are doing. And I find it impossible to describe it. I get embarrased explaining it. 

I would be even more embarrased if I was a sympathiser.

Attack is the best form of defence, and all that.

Always used to really bother me under Houllier when we'd be sometimes be only 1-0 up and he'd take off an attacking player for a defender to try and close up shop. We'd invite the opposition onto us, and frequently someone at the back would screw up and concede a goal, and we're then stuck at 1-1 without as many attacking players on the field. Much more comfortable with Rodgers' style of keeping our opponent under pressure and sustaining the attacking momentum - maybe we end up having to win 5-3 and don't get many clean sheets, but at least we're not throwing away points because we can't hold onto our leads but don't try and increase them either.

true,notsoyoungpadawan,null,null,"&gt;I actually don't mind a bit of bias from the pundits or commentators. I think it shows that they really care and are passionate about the game.

Well of course they are passionate. Its football. Everyone's passionate about it if you follow it. The problem arises when the biased opinions are picked up by the other media sources, who turn that bias into absolute fact. And since these pundits are all ex-footballers, everyone apart from the CFC fans ends up gobbling down that pile of shit because its assumed that ex-footballers always know what they're talking about. But when you watch someone like Michael Owen or Graeme Souness speak you know they don't know what they're talking about half the time.

Personally I've always felt that Andy Gray was the best football pundit I've watched. His opinions were always as close to non-biased as possible and usually spot on - I know the hate regarding him and I'm not a supporter of it or his, this is purely from a football opinion perspective. I remember him and Sky used the goal-line technology during the Champions League semi vs Liverpool, where I think Luis Garcia thought he'd scored a goal but it was never a goal. Jose called it the ""ghost goal"", I think, and Gray said he was sure it was not a goal as well. 

I watched him again on Al-jazeera during the month of December and his opinions were spot on as always.

true,GratefullyGodless,tennant,Tennant,"By adventure show, I mean a show that's primary focus is adventure, not comedy, or drama, although such a show will touch upon both. It's a show where the plot is the main driving element, and the characters and their interactions are often written to service the plot, instead of the plot being written to service the characters. 

I don't think Amy or River were one-dimensional by any means. But, any adventure show by it's very nature cannot devote the time to explore a characters inner depths much. You have to keep the plot moving, you have to drive the story forward, and other parts, such as character development have to by necessity take a lesser priority.

   If you want to delve deep into a characters depths, then you have a Character Drama or a Monologue, but you wind up with little time to devote to a complex plot with multiple events and scenes. And, Steven Moffat LOVES complex plots, with lots of twists and turns and foreshadowing.

   So, it's not that Steven Moffat has created one-dimensional characters. Amy's feelings towards the Doctor were complex, because of when and how they first met. He was always her ""Raggedy man"", and they felt a protectiveness for each other based on the fact that she was the first companion he had met when she was a child, and then had travel with him as an adult. I think Moffat did a nice job with Amy up until that last half-season she was in. It seems like he had run out of Amy and Rory ideas by that point.

River was brash, bold, and sadder than you give her credit for. She blew herself out an airlock, trusting the Doctor to be there for her. That's a ballsy thing to do. But, a lot of the bravado of River comes from the fact that she knew what was going to happen, and had to keep that from the man she loved, and the mother she never knew while growing up. It's not that she didn't have feelings, just that she had to keep those feelings to herself, and how better than to put up a light hearted front to keep herself from breaking down. 

   I think both characters had more depth than you think, I just think Moffat was more subtle about their depth than referencing it directly.

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;Probably?

I'm sorry I don't understand what you mean, do you disagree that the photo was probably provided by a family member? Where else did it come from?

&gt;Considering how the tabloid press conducts itself, I really wouldn't give them the benefit of the doubt.

What i mean is, if you put a complex photo in an article, you need to provide context. So every time it is used, your caption would need to explain why he was holding a memorial, why he was in a graveyard. This information could be considered distracting to the current story, and the content of the article. In this case it also could be considered to be being empathetic to Mark, when the author may not want to take sides. The photo may have been cropped simply to avoid these problems and act solely as a way of identifying the person in question.

&gt;So taken out of context, what do you think it makes him look like? What emotions does it evoke? What emotions do you think he had when it was taken?

Without any context it just looks like a photo of a man, there doesn't seem to be any particular emotion on display. With context of course you can imagine he was probably feeling grief.

&gt;You think there was a plethora of photos back in July 2011, before the shooting that sparked riots? How about after a trial that let the officers off for free, even though there are a bunch of inconsistencies in their stories? Before he was shot, nobody knew him. Why would there be pictures of him so easily accessible on Google?

I understand your point that back when the shooting first happened there would not be many photos of him. So fair enough, IF someone wanted to paint him in a bad light, it would make sense for them to crop the image in this way. However, that in itself does not prove anything, as the image could also have been changed for the reasons i have suggested. This also only applies to when the image was used right after the shooting, not later on when more images became available.

&gt;If I had a family member who'd just got shot by the police, I'm not sure I'd have chosen a photo like that.

You would have to ask whoever provided the photo what their reason was, but someone gave that photo to the media.

Sure, but the point is that there are a huge number of cyclists on /r/unitedkingdom that are going to upvote anything to do with cycling. It's disproportionate - why can't it stay in /r/ukbike seeing as absolutely every cycling topic is on both?

I can understand it being difficult to get any games when there are only four other opponents.

This post was aimed at the nth teams that aren't signed up to the ladder currently and was toned in such a way to the people who know who I am.

I don't mean any disrespect as you don't know who I am but I don't want you to come across uniformed in the future. I don't really play Dota at the moment ergo no-team but I follow this community quite closely as i'm probably the best reason it's alive and kicking in it's current state (/ego). 

I founded UKDota.net a little more than a year ago, providing tournaments and such for UK amateur teams including qualifiers for LAN events and using my volunteers to manage and run the events, some of whom now volunteer for ESL.

Whilst doing this I was also captaining Reason Gaming until I stopped sometime around June?

If there's anyone here who's already shown the rest of us how it's done and how it's not done, that'd be me.

Sorry, w'll.

If you're suggesting he ride centrally rather than slightly to the right of centre I fail to see your point - either way he will be totally obstructing the lane with the same traffic implications that seem to be your main concern. If you're suggesting he ride much further to the left to allow overtaking within the lane - when the cyclist may have considered conditions and decided it would be too risky -  then you're going against the advice of organisations who dare I suggest may have more expertise and data at hand than you in this field! 



If you don't believe in taking the lane as a defensive move then by all means don't, but you can't expect other cyclists to adhere to yours and other road users personal preferences against their own safety interest and government advice. Especially not when it's a dual-carriageway and you're all likely to be held at the next traffic light as it is!

true,letsgofriday,null,null,"&gt;The success is due largely to a simple formula: Put the best team possible on the ice and stay away from Northern Ireland’s complicated politics. That means being the only team in the league that does not play the national anthem before home games, and making sure no fans come into the building wearing T-shirts or colours that might cause offence. Nothing is left to chance. The team’s name, derived from Northern Ireland’s famous Giants Causeway rock formation, and teal-coloured uniforms, were carefully chosen to be as neutral as possible.

&gt;“We’re a really good thing for Northern Ireland and Belfast, because we’ve made a conscious decision not to get involved in all that,” said Mr. Kelman, a Calgary native who has been with the club since its founding in 2000 as a player and now manager.

&gt;It is working for fans like Wendy Cush, who fell in love with hockey about five years ago when a friend took her to a Giants’ game. Ms. Cush did not like soccer and rugby, both politicized in Northern Ireland, and enjoys coming to a sporting event where unionist, nationalist, Catholic or Protestant allegiances are put aside. “That’s all left at the door,” she said. “No one cares about that here.”

52 days worked per year with no other kind of regulation? So you're saying that people would be in effect, earning their yearly amount of JSA with 52 days worth of work? That's over £3800, not including housing benefit which can be included on a claim PLUS the wage earned by the work put in.
Let's say average rent is £400 pcm (which is pretty low) that then gives someone ￡4800 (£8600 altogether) for 52 days worth of work with no benchmark to check against?



I'm not saying everyone is going to take advantage, and in theory it sounds like a great way of giving people an opportunity to work on/prove their skills. Unfortunately, I believe, there are too many people who would do their 52 days and then sit back and do nothing, further inflaming the 'us &amp;  them' mentality of people working and people claiming benefits.

true,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"What she said is considerably more sympathetic than the headline suggests.

It's not really even an issue of that the Right-Wing hate food banks.  There is a constant stream of hate and loathing that washes over us from the media about how disgusting, lazy and untrustworthy the poor and people on benefits are.  It's terrifying if you realise this, because it's there like background noise all the time to the point that not only does it become what some people believe, but that we're all sort of accustomed and desensitised to it.

The fact is there are a small number of people who are, for want of a better or more delicate term lazy scum.  They exist.  But they're a tiny, tiny fraction of the people who get covered with the spare tar from their brush.  But every day the noise reverts to pointing out some toerag and telling everyone, *""Look!  Look at the lazy scum!  Despise the lazy scum!  Revile the lazy scum!  That's YOUR tax money he's drinking!  That's YOUR tax money he's smoking!  you pay for him HATE HIM!""*

This is where this problem then oozes into the cracks in society.  Especially because you don't see the media annointed scumbag yourself, usually.  So what you see around you are people who work hard to scrape by.  *(Unless you're significantly affluent in which case you almost certainly don't see them and you probably particularly resent paying so much tax for them.)*  

You don't see that for every one person like there there're a thousand kids who worked hard to get decent grades in school, were told, *""Oh, they hand out A's like sweeties these days, in my day you had to work!""* when they got a decent education and then looked at the unloving outside world to see that there're hardly any jobs and the ones you're offered are likely for sixteen hours, if you're lucky enough to dodge a zero hour contract!

There're more people working three jobs and scraping by to pay the bills than there are of these designated scumbags!

But we're constantly reminded:  There are millions out of work!  There are millions claiming benefits!  Look!  Look at the thief, the drunk, the drug addict, the lazy waster!  No one ever actually tells you that all the unempoyed are that reviled wretch, but you're shown them together every day.

If you forgive the lack of little brass callipers to hold your eyes open it's a little like the stream of images in the therapy sessions in A Clockwork Orange.  Learn to revile this, learn to hate this, learn to be sickened by this.  *(Perhaps Benefits Street should be watched while listening to the glorious Ludwig van!)*

Some time back there was an article in the local paper *(Bradford)* that described a trend with local schools moving cooking classes to Fridays so they could ensure that the kids were decently fed on the Friday because they were worried some weren't being properly fed over the weekends.

This article drew from the peopl commenting on it a torrent of hate and spite toward the parents on the assumption that they were benefit chugging dross.  And the point that whether the parents were or not the important thing these was that kids aren't being fed properly.  

How broken do you have to be to read that and your reaction is not concern for the kids, but wrath at their parents over some squandered benefits?

I work with someone whose mother runs a school breakfast club because the kids turn up every morning unfed.  It ought to reduce you to tears to know that a five year-old child devours a Pot Noodle and says it's the best thing he's ever tasted!

Fourth place receives a play off place in the Champions League and can play against any number of teams including the fourth placed team in La Liga to the title winners of a lower ranked league.

Fifth place receives a play off place in the Europa League. However, if the FA Cup winner is already in the Champions League then fifth gets entry straight into the group stage and the runner up of the FA Cup goes into the third round of the Europa League (had Wigan lost the final last season they would have entered in the third round).

Sixth and seventh place can receive a place in the Europa League should the domestic cups (Capital One Cup and the FA Cup) be won by teams already in Europe and the runner up of the FA Cup is also in Europe. The runner up of the Capital One Cup receives nothing if the competitor is already in Europe.

The winner of the Champions League now bumps out the fourth placed team to the Europa League play off stages (or group stages depending on the domestic cup results). Tottenham finished in the top 4 but thanks to Chelsea winning the Champions League; Chelsea received the Champions League play-off place despite finishing 6th.

In 2005 when Liverpool finished 5th but won the Champions League this sparked a debate on what should happen. Everton were furious at the proposition of losing the Champions League spot but also supported the idea of 5 teams in the CL in order to get Liverpool into the competition in the 2005/06 season. 5 teams joined but Liverpool had to start from the very first round and in the end any of the complications of having 5 teams from the same domestic league in the competition were avoided when Everton goofed up and lost the play-off.

Also United have zero chance of winning the Champions League against the likes of Bayern, Real, Athletico, City, Barca, Dortmund or all the others they could possibly face over two legs in the last 8 or 4.

&gt;A **knight-errant** is a figure of medieval chivalric romance literature. The adjective errant (meaning ""wandering, roving"") indicates how the knight-errant would wander the land in search of adventures to prove his chivalric virtues, either in knightly duels (pas d'armes) or in some other pursuit of courtly love.

&gt;The template of the knight-errant are the heroes of the Round Table of the Arthurian cycle such as Gawain, Lancelot and Percival. The quest par excellence in pursuit of which these knights wander the lands is that of the Holy Grail, such as in Perceval, the Story of the Grail written by Chrétien de Troyes in the 1180s.

We've certainly got the depth and quality to run a three man midfield in the center, and with Paulinho showing flashes of his best, I think it'd work damn well.  Also got Bentaleb for a little variety.

As for the main topic, it would require a huge change to how we play.  We'd have little to no physicality in the front three.  Which could work, considering it would be focused on pulling the central defenders out and then taking advantage of the open space.  I think both Townsend and Lamela could and wuld excel in this kind of system, so there is that.

I also agree that Soldado could handle it too.  He has a good awareness of space.  Ade does as well, and with his hold up play and tendency to drop deep, he fits the bill.

You can calculate the risk of a car crash because the causes are known, there are plenty of data and they are consistent thus predictable and you can insure against the risk. The issue with macro-politics and global stability is there are far far too many variables to accurately predict what will happen. The risk of terrorists getting a nuclear weapon or a country descending into turmoil and rebellion is not really a risk at all it's an uncertainty - it's unpredictable and the outcomes are unknown. As a result you have to plan for the worst case scenario. Even as time goes on, uncertainty clears and risks start to materialise there's no way to know if we will be prepared enough soon enough. If we get rid of our aircraft carriers then come to realise the risk of needing aircraft carriers in the next year is huge then we're fucked because it takes over 10 years to built them. 

If Simon Jenkins thinks we don't need aircraft carriers, for example, and the carrier takes 10 years to build then he needs to show we won't need an aircraft carrier for at least 10 years and he needs to make the same assessment every year and if he gets it wrong, and our citizens are killed then we should all blame him for it....well that's exactly the scenario the people who hash out the defence budget are in.

* Liverpool and City have been offered 19 yr old winger Ricardo Kishna at a cut price by Ajax, his contract runs out at the end of the season

* We are interested in Schalke winger Jefferson Farfan (29 yrs old). Reportedly we are willing to pay £11m but Schalke want £15m. Seems unlikely they would sell at all considering he is the team's highest scorer this season and is on contract until 2016

* Cruzeiro turned down a £8.3million bid from a Premier League side for 24 yr old playmaker Everton Riberio, a reported LFC target. Bid possibly from United, and negotiations are continuing

* 23 yr old Ghanian midfielder and reported target Emmanuel Agyemang-Badu of Udinese said that there has been no bid from LFC. However he said he would jump at the chance to join us

How many times have we all seen a player like Salah, with a good track record in a foreign league and a few big European performances to his name, come to England and struggle mightily?

I feel that FSG are wary of being burned by another Carroll/Downing situation, as they should be. However, if we were to pay over the odds for someone (as often happens in January) and they don't work out, I could see FSG tightening the pursestrings further as they work towards fully repairing the club's finances. I'm not saying I don't think we should be active in the market, just that I think making the wrong signing now could be long-term much more harmful than not making any signings. 

Unless something miraculous happens and we get the chance to sign someone like Mata or Draxler (this won't happen in this window if even the next), I think some prudence is definitely called for right now.

Cameron was born in London and brought up in Peasemore, Berkshire.[6] Cameron has a brother, Allan Alexander (born 1963, a barrister and QC)[7] and two sisters, Tania Rachel (born 1965) and Clare Louise (born 1971).[4][8] His father, Ian, was born at Blairmore House, a country house near Huntly, Aberdeenshire, and died near Toulon, in France, on 8 September 2010;[9] Ian was born with both legs deformed and underwent repeated operations to correct them. Blairmore was built by Cameron's great-great-grandfather, Alexander Geddes,[10] who had made a fortune in the grain trade in Chicago and returned to Scotland in the 1880s.[11]

King William IV, one of Cameron's ancestors
Through his paternal grandmother, Enid Agnes Maud Levita, Cameron is a lineal descendant of King William IV by his mistress Dorothea Jordan. This illegitimate line consists of five generations of women starting with Elizabeth Hay, Countess of Erroll, née FitzClarence, William and Jordan's sixth child,[12] through to Cameron's grandmother (thereby making Cameron a 5th cousin of Queen Elizabeth II).[13]
Cameron's paternal forebears also have a long history in finance. His father Ian was senior partner of the stockbrokers Panmure Gordon, in which firm partnerships had long been held by Cameron's ancestors, including David's grandfather and great-grandfather,[8] and was a Director of estate agent John D. Wood. David Cameron's great-great-grandfather Emile Levita, a German Jewish financier (and descendant of Renaissance scholar Elia Levita), who obtained British citizenship in 1871, was the director of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China which became Standard Chartered Bank in 1969.[13] His wife, Cameron's great-great-grandmother, was a descendant of the wealthy Danish Jewish Rée family on her father's side.[14][15]
One of Emile's sons, Arthur Francis Levita (died 1910, brother of Sir Cecil Levita),[16] of Panmure Gordon stockbrokers, together with great-great-grandfather Sir Ewen Cameron,[17] London head of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, played key roles in arranging loans supplied by the Rothschilds to the Japanese Central Banker (later Prime Minister) Takahashi Korekiyo for the financing of the Japanese Government in the Russo-Japanese war.[18]
Cameron's maternal grandfather was Sir William Mount, 2nd Baronet, an Army officer who served as High Sheriff of Berkshire, and Cameron's maternal great-grandfather was Sir William Mount, 1st Baronet, CBE, Conservative MP for Newbury 1918–1922. Cameron's great-great-grandmother was Lady Ida Matilda Alice Feilding. His great-great-great-grandfather was William Feilding, 7th Earl of Denbigh, GCH, PC, a courtier and Gentleman of the Bedchamber.[19] His mother's cousin, Sir Ferdinand Mount, was head of 10 Downing Street's Policy Unit in the early 1980s. Cameron is the nephew of Sir William Dugdale, brother-in-law of Katherine, Lady Dugdale (died 2004) Lady-in-Waiting to HM The Queen since 1955,[20][21] and former Chairman of Aston Villa Football Club. Birmingham-born documentary filmmaker Joshua Dugdale is his cousin.[22]
Cameron has said: ""On my mother's side of the family, her mother was a Llewellyn, so Welsh. I'm a real mixture of Scottish, Welsh and English"".[23]

While you could argue that Luiz may be a better defensive player, Cahill fits better into the team.

true,military_history,null,null,"No. Say you're mugged by a guy with a gun (a knife would work too). He threatens you, you have little choice but to hand over your valuables, so you do that. He leaves. You have lost a few things but they are replaceable, and most importantly you are alive and unhurt. If you're lucky, the police might even catch the guy and get your stuff back. But even if not, you're alive.

Now say you are the sort of person who wants to defend themselves. You go out and get a gun. Now you get mugged, by a man with a gun (or a knife) and you're not helpless. You are able to defend yourself, and since you've gone to the effort to arm yourself, you probably will want to. Two things can happen:

A) You grab your gun, and you manage to shoot the mugger before he can react. You've just killed someone. You are in all likelihood going to suffer from nightmares, PTSD and what have you as a result. But at least you're alive, AND you haven't been mugged.

B) You go for your gun, but the mugger gets there first. There's a good chance that he's more prepared than you to use his weapon, less likely to hesitate, as he is desperate and he's not armed himself for nothing. You are killed, or at least grievously wounded. By trying to defend yourself you've escalated the situation and turned what could have been the loss of a few replaceable items into the loss of the only truly irreplaceable thing you own, your life.

I understand that sometimes people do defend themselves successfully. But I don't know why anyone in the right mind would risk the consequences of *failing* to defend yourself successfully. That risk is colossal. And that's before you consider the risk of someone turning the gun on you. Or someone taking the gun (however careful you are, that is always a risk) and turning it on someone else. Or someone messing around with the gun and killing themselves by accident. Or someone with mental problem turning the gun on themselves.

true,NastyCabbage,null,null,"Can you not get a student loan? Student loans also cover your living costs by lending around £3500 a year on top of your fees. That would basically solve your problems assuming you will be a decent earner once your studies are finished. Admittedly I'm on the £3k a year fee loan, but I just lose £100 from my paycheck every month pre-tax and don't really notice it (and wouldn't have my job without that degree).

Life as a student almost the poorest you will be in your life. My opinion is that if you can't live off £40 a week (excl rent and bills) then you are at uni for the wrong reasons.

Taking advantage of a grant due to a mistake is risky. If you get caught out, and it is obvious that you did it on purpose, you could be in trouble. I imagine you would get away with it if it 'could have been' an honest mistake. Don't they ask the parents their incomes though (in which case they would have to lie), or do they just rely entirely on the P60?

You should be able to get a student bank account quite easily. Some of them offer a £2k interest free overdraft for the duration of your studies. After you finish, it turns into a graduate account. 1 year after you finish studying you will need to have the balance down at below £1500. 2 years &lt;£1000. 3 years £0.

This is also about to happen in Germany with the creation of Super-Bayern.

Over the next decade I think we will see an even increased distance in terms of financial success and competition between the CL teams and everyone else. In England the only thing that will keep it from getting out of control is the sheer number of financially viable and competitive teams (currently Tottenham, Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, City, and United with honorable mentions going to Everton and Newcastle) who will take resources away from each other (read: CL football).

true,Vaneshi,cnty-england,Midlander trapped in Hampshite,"&gt; WorkShare jobseekers collaborate to design a new playground.

And would these people be fully versed in the H&amp;S legislation with regards to children's play areas?  If not it makes this step pointless until they've achieved that knowledge. 

&gt; WorkShare to install, along with any professional assistance

They are unlikely to know the finer points of construction, as you're already getting in a team of paid professionals to 'assist' why bother with the unemployed helpers?  They will get in the way, slow things down and cause the project to cost more than it would of without them being there.   Also by incorporating unqualified, unskilled cheap labour in to the mix the council would run the risk of pissing off the unions especially if any of them thought a member was dropped from the project in favour of the free worker.  

&gt; After the work is completed, the council are politely asked if they would like to pay the jobseekers

LOL.  ""No."" will be the answer each and every time.  Doesn't matter how polite you are about it, the answer will remain ""No"". 

&gt; Jobseekers are not mandated to take part

Excellent and like the hypothetical council my answer would be similar.  I have better things to do, like finding actual paid employment, rather than wasting my time on something I wouldn't even bother putting on my CV and I am unlikely to be competent at in the first place; I am a SysAdmin (and a published author TYVM) not a child's playground designer. 

&gt; I think people wouldn’t slack off

People post to reddit from work (and not just during their lunch hour either).  People deliberately take as a long a shit as possible at work so they can crap on the clock.  When not posting to reddit or taking a dump the size of a super tanker they procrastinate to the point of absurdity when allowed to.  Of COURSE people will slack off, that is if anything human nature.
 
&gt; If they’re willing to go work for their benefits

If it pays NMW or better I'm game for a giggle; which in this instance would be exactly 11.3 hours or 2.8 hours of work at my usual rate as it wouldn't pay anything other than £71.70 a week, as you're only politely asking for donations which as already discussed you will never get.

&gt; The exemption from the jobseekers agreement

Which isn't just a contract that says you the claimant will do X, it's also the agreement which stipulates the government will pay you Y.  Being exempt from it would actually mean not getting any JSA. So when faced with your scheme it is in my best interest to say ""No.""

Louisiana has lax gun laws but incredibly high murder rates, so I would say that it has little to do with gun ownership and more to do with culture or socio-economic circumstances.

I've attempted to be as clear as possible, but from your reply and more than two thirds of it dedicated to some racially motivated conspiracy I never indicated, it's easy to see why you're distracted.

I'll try again in bullet points:

* The press engaged in manipulation (this post) of the character of a man already pretty much established as a criminal. So much so you are *still* parroting the notion that he was on his way to a killing. No such evidence exists. If it does, please link to it. What we *do* have is court testimony from the man arrested for amongst other things selling the firearm in question that it's intended use was as ""security"" at a drug deal. For a man who is apparently a hardened killer doesn't it strike you as odd he was setting up his first big drug deal and for some reason didn't already own a gun?

* The details of the juries findings are free and easy to access, yet your version of it is wrong...but you still state it with authority. This is the attitude I speak of. Check again the details and tally with your interpretation.

* The IPCC *and* the police initially lied. Again, something that seems odd for a group of people who did nothing wrong and have nothing to hide. The various conflicting stories, eyewitness accounts and the fact that the attending officers needed to sit together for several hours to come up with a story to explain a few short seconds of perfectly reasonable police action doesn't strike you as odd. Fair enough

* The IPCC have now apologised and admit several lines of inquiry are yet to be explored and that changes need to be made in procedures as clearly mistakes were made or at least more transparency is required.

This isn't about racism. No one ever said it was. This is about the press, the police and the IPCC overseeing a series of events and exhibiting behaviours that stink to high heaven. Once again, not to belabour the point, Duggan is no hero or martyr, and *his* actions are not what I spoke of. At no point did I make excuses for him or attempt to paint him as an innocent. I am simply saying the speed and effort in dismissing the questions above...the resistance to them, as exhibited by your own reluctance to acknowledge any anomalies or troubling aspects of the actions of the above parties rings alarm bells, at least for me.

true,DEADB33F,null,null,"&gt; I have a fairly schizoid opinion on guns as though I like shooting personally I do believe it's better for a society as a whole not to have easy access to them.

This is why I think the US is in a difficult position regarding their firearms legislation.

Preventing law abiding people from having access to the means to defend themselves isn't really an answer while every criminal has easy access to firearms.

They obviously need to do *something* to curb the levels of gun violence, but restricting the rights of those who obey the law won't really do much.

One thing I think the UK does very well is require that all firearms be safely stored when not in use. If someone breaks into a gun owner's house in the UK the firearms will be stored in a secure gun-safe and won't be easily accessible. This is a huge factor in stopping legally owned firearms falling into the hands of criminals.

In the US it's perfectly legal to keep a handgun in a drawer next to the bed, or keep a loaded shotgun in a cupboard under the stairs. As a UK gun owner I find this attitude to gun storage to be utterly insane, although many people from the US will defend it to the hilt.

---

Depression &amp; mental health is another issue that US anti-gun (and pro-gun) campaigners gloss over entirely. The US doesn't really have a comprehensive mental health program. You either have to pay through the nose for drugs &amp; therapy or deal with it (and the consequences for not having it treated properly).

Edinburgh University unions were originally run by full time staff members who would, up until the late 70's, fine or permanently ban students whose behaviour was 'unbecoming.'  This was before union membership was automatically obtained through matriculation - a yearly fee had to be paid for a student to use the facilities.

There were cases where students were fined money for vomiting, and in one case where a male patron was banned for swearing in front of a lady (he had been asked to resign to save face, and had refused.)

I mean I assume they went away and investigated him, asked around and guess what they found... yeah he was a scumbag. So, you're saying they shouldn't have reported what they found out about him? Because it seems to me that, in this case, the press actually were *spot on* with their representation. So what's the problem?  
  
Second point. What about my version is wrong? I took that from the BBC analysis nine days ago. The only liberty I might have taken is the reason *why* he had the gun which I don't think was a key question for the jury. Though that seems like a really odd point for you to take issue with, so maybe you could explain that? You criticise me for making the assumption that this guy was going to use the gun to shoot someone... let's be realistic he didn't buy it to shoot pheasants.

What is it you believe the press reported that was ""spot on""? Their speculation about how high up the ladder of organised crime Mark Duggan possibly was? Do you want to share where all this was verified to the point such speculation can now be deemed ""spot on""?

If you admit to taking a liberty, why? Why take a liberty? To what end? Why does a criminal's record need further embellishment from you? 

The rebuttal to ""the press cropped photos to make a man look more menacing"" is not ""he had a gun and *was* menacing"". In fact the very fact he was in real life a menacing man would mean such press manipulation was wholly unnecessary. How many times have we seen photos of serial killers but they're friendly holiday snaps provided by the family? Would it be okay to draw on fangs and a cartoon scar to make the killer look more menacing? Wouldn't the details of their deeds be sufficient? Would you say ""but, he *is* a murderous killer, who cares if the press shot has been photoshopped with a striped Freddy shirt for the front of the paper?""

The odd point for me to question is one that people are repeating as some justification for any and all issues raised. See the very top comment in this chain. The killing has already been justified by a jury, but people seem compelled to justify it further by cooking up a hypothetical assassination this hardened killer was on his way to with his brand new gun. No one seems to question the notion that a killer doesn't seem to own a weapon until that very day.

Personally I think he's more than capable of being positionally disciplined, it's more a case of whether he wants to. 

Rodgers' comments on how Gerrard has now realised there isn't a reliance on him to score and create as much as there used to be, and thus he's more willing to help out in other ways, is promising - he might become more positionally disciplined as a result of not feeling like he needs to be pushing forward and helping the team get goals.

What this doesn't change, though, is the need to have more quality in the more forward-moving midfield spots.

The only chance I feel is if there is some substance to the supposed friction between him and Mourinho (or if JM has his eye on another striker, maybe we'll get another loan year). If he doesn't like him for whatever reason, then Abramovic isn't going to bat an eyelid about losing money on him if he has to. Wikipedia puts the Chelsea transfer fee at £10-17M, and with his age, potential and goal tallies over the last two seasons, he'd easily go for more than that.

From RL's point of view - he'll be as good as guaranteed Champion's League every year, more money and a solid shot at the title, especially now Mourinho has pledged his future and Ferguson is gone. On the other hand, he'll be worshipped at EFC more than he would at Chelsea and won't need to play second fiddle to any other striker.
