true,HannibalAntePortas,null,null,"I personally want LVG because he's had a lasting and foundational impact on every club he's ever managed. That to me speaks volumes especially when you check his CV and see the likes of Bayern and Barcelona. With LVG comes a culture of discipline, communication and success and I believe we need that in a bad way. I want him because of his experience and track record and I think we should do what it takes to get him.

While I like de Boer a lot and think he's a good manager, I can't help but think that he has the benefit of managing one of the best organized and most cultured clubs in the world in Ajax. As I've said before, Ajax is Ajax and at Ajax de Boer is surrounded by other Ajax men who are managing Ajax players who have grown up playing the Ajax way. No other club in the world has such a consistent culture from top to bottom and the only other one that is close is his likely next destination; Barcelona. 

I personally am not a big fan of Yakin. He's the manager of the far and away best club in Switzerland. They have the best players and the biggest budget. Basel should dominate the league, yet they're currently only 3 points ahead of Grasshoppers and have drawn 13 times this season...13. Last season they lost 6 times and drew 9 times and only won the league by 3 points. When you're the clear favorite in the league and you have the biggest budget, you should dominate.

He's not bad by any means, even with us he's shown that he will get you goals one way or another.

What happens instead is people park half on the pavement on each side of the road so that you can then fit 1 car down the middle (and so everyone coming the other way has to wait back until it's passed).

Even when most of the houses have driveways, most households have 2+ cars making it impossible to park them otherwise, and there's absolutely nowhere nearby to park either. Most of the roads around here are in the same situation, and banning parking on pavements would create an impossible situation, it can and will never happen.

true,Rideitor,UnionFlag,"Leicester - '95 TRX850, '94 CB250N Two Fifty, 2 x CBX250RS-E","It is very difficult to know the actual compression of an engine, indeed it varies between engines that are otherwise exactly the same, but if you mean the compression ratio then that is a bad place to start. Real compression, or dynamic compression as it is known has to take into account the total amount of stuff in the cylinder, not only new air/fuel but also exhaust gases from the previous time it fired - if your engine has lairy cams there will be less exhaust gas, and you can up the ratio a bit. If it has normal road going cams you can't go so far because there's more gas already in there, but then the extra heat of that exhaust gas makes the new mixture easier to burn.. And then you have the actual shape of the combustion chamber and how much it heats or cools the mixture, and a squish band that cools the mixture and can allow a higher compression ratio and and and.. It's a bit of a science.

Overall, our basic 95RON fuel is already higher octane than is available in many countries and is fine for almost anything, certainly if it is naturally aspirated. I mean there are bikes out there with 12.5:1 compression ratios running fine on 95RON, it's not an issue now that engines are mostly understood by the manufacturers.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Yeah? Not that I know much about it but I got the impression metal had a good community, once you got past the ones that liked metal to the exclusion of all other music. How come it's getting stagnant?

Same music, lack of innovation. So many metalheads complained when KoRn, Five Finger Death Punch, InFlames (And a few others) did a few Dubstep and Drum'n'Bass inspired tracks... So all the bands went back to sounding like Metallica/In Flames rip-offs. New stuff is greated with ""Eurgh, more emo bullshit!"" ... see the hate on FFDP's original album.

The people in my locale are at least some of the most judgemental people I know, arrogant, snotty about their opinions on music and really have about as much personality as a tea-bag.

It may simply be my locale where the issue is these days, but eight-nine years ago it used to be fucking wicked to play, watch and be apart of music. These days, it's all about brand recognition.

&gt; Haha, calling Operation Yewtree! 

Operation Steak-need.

&gt; Yeah landlords can be bitches about guns, but I guess some of their reasons are legit. Not least of which, they probably won't like someone drilling big bastard holes in walls and floors to fit a safe.

I agree entirely with his opinion really, I just voiced the opinion and said I'd involve him due to the need for a weapons box. He said he was uncomfortable so no problem! I have however decided on building a basement when I get my own place... and storing enough weaponry to concern the local police force.

&gt; Not liking airsoft rifles is pretty harsh though, the only potentially dangerous thing about them is they look like real guns to the gun-phobic general populace.

I have three weapons though and they're all very realistic. G36C, Benelli M3 Super Shotgun and a Glock 17. I've had to threaten a neighbour with the second one simply because he thought kicking off at my front door (after I asked him politely to turn his music down) was a great idea... so I really get his concern.

I don't help the gun-phobes sometimes as they really are a means to an end with some people (My neighbour is the only person I've only threatened, I'm glad I did because he had a knife in his boot... I'm really glad he's gone now)

We recently looked at moving to a house and in the same area a three bed house is around £650 a month. Were just saving the deposit for a house now instead. Renting actually allows for budgeting better and knowing where your money goes as any repairs are down to the landlord to fix.

Check if the place comes with a fridge, washing machine as that cuts down on expense, but you'll need cutlery, plates, glasses, kettle, towels, oven trays, cleaning supplies etc. Your first food shop tends to be expensive as you buy stuff that will last a while such as ketchup.

It sounds like the genre is in a difficult place, when innovation and taking inspiration from other genres is vilified. The snotty metal fan is a pretty common stereotype, and one that seems to be worryingly true.

Fair enough I guess, but it is kind of annoying when people say they're  'uncomfortable' with guns.

He wasn't a flop yet, we were just assuming he was having a slow start. 

But you're saying that now, almost three and a half years later he's still being picked because the higher-ups believe that it's more important to have a ""big name"" like Torres up front than it is to have a competent striker like Ba (assuming in this situation that Ba is indeed better than Torres). By now it is clear that he is not good enough and that he will never be good enough, but you are claiming that he is picked over Ba because of his name.

I try to listen to everything and anything with metal, but it's so repetitive and the community slates EVERYTHING original, or at least cries plagiarism everywhere these days. It's a dying genre locally, being taken over by a small electronic scene that is rapidly gaining ground.

&gt; Fair enough I guess, but it is kind of annoying when people say they're 'uncomfortable' with guns. I get that they're a tool designed for killing and that's kinda creepy, but overall the gun fear in the country does my nut in. Unlicensed criminals are the ones to be afraid of, not legal owners who just want to practice their hobby. 

I had this very argument at work a few weeks ago. I said I loved doing tournament shooting and got so many dodgy looks from ""THINK OF THE CHILDREN"" types, it got difficult to even have the conversation really. Drives me banana's.

&gt; I'm with you on the 'getting a small armoury' thing haha, as you say it's just a matter of money and space!

I'd love to get a G36C in single shot variety. That'd crack me up, but at least I can say I've got one!

&gt; Sounds like your neighbour was a pleasant guy... In all seriousness though it's a good job he didn't whine to the police about the whole airsoft shotgun thing, they go fucking spastic over the slightest suggestion of firearms misuse haha.

He had a record of threatening behaviour anyway (Checked with a mate who did it on the sly for me), he would just play his music on 11 at all hours of the day. 

I woke him up one morning to have a chat (proper polite and everything...) and he just went ballistic about me being unfair. When I proposed that playing dubstep at 2:30am on a Monday morning was the same he disagreed. I walked off informing him of the Police being called next time it happened... he hit the roof, followed me to my door (Only 20feet away) and wouldn't back off, when I went to shut the door he jammed his foot in there. When warned he was now on very thin Ice I just reached round the door to where I keep the shotgun and pulled it when I saw the fucking HUGE knife had in his boot. Told him to fuck off if he knew what was good for him. 

Have the occasional issue with his old room mate because of it... but I think he's scared shitless since Halloween and he saw my friends and I walk out of my apartment in full black SWAT attire with Umbrella Corp logos and enough realistic firearms to concern an Army Battalion.

Luckily enough he wasn't stupid, and I know enough coppers that they're aware I own weapons. I've had to let them know any time I intend to go out in public with them (I do the occasional Cosplay type thing when I see costume contests.)

I watch Ajax a lot because they've been playing really beautiful football with De Boer, so I'd say I have seen about half of their games this season, and almost all of their games this season. Last season Fischer stood out a lot more than he has this season. This is mostly due to him being injured. Anyway, the reason I like him is because he has a really good first touch (the anti-Shelvey), has a lot of pace, can finish with both feet, and can pick a pass. He's a really clever player, which is something that you can't say about Assaidi a lot of the time. He's not as fast as Sterling, but he's plenty fast enough to keep up in PL. 
Not to mention, he's only 20. A lot of people have been really hard on him this season, but it's similar to how many LFC fans felt about Sterling halfway through last season. He's a kid, he's still learning the game, and he got hurt, which also has hurt his confidence. I am of the opinion that he would be able to succeed on our team and would be able to learn so much from Brendan and the other players. He could be a world beater one day, and I'm not the only person who is saying that. When there's hype, there is often at least some talent, and Fischer is no exception.

&gt; they proceeded to kill civillians for the next 30 years. If they had picked their targets better history would have looked more favourably upon them.

yeah like that time they blew up docklands. how many died? oh yeah. two. you see, as with most military organisations, innocent people die when they deploy. unless you can name me one army who has never killed civilians. moreover, armies sometimes have rogue elements and people acting independently of said force yet using the same banner. The actions of one or two unscrupulous volunteers should not necessarily diminish the entire organisation, and certainly doesn't take away from the fact that the IRA was a different kettle of fish to the UVF or UDA. The latter two were purely sectarian in motivation and ideology, and would [kill civilians as part of their strategy, just for being Catholic and/or nationalist.](http://www.reddit.com/r/northernireland/comments/1albj1/sickening_extract_from_pup_manifesto_about_uvf/) They were also largely funded, equipped and even populated by British military intelligence. You see, there's a massive hypocrisy whereby people reserve the strongest words in their (limited) vocabulary for the IRA (""scum"", ""filth""), yet not apply this to the British army, who have of course killed far more civilians all over the world. But that's OK because they're a standing army right?

By the way, anybody who calls the PIRA terrorists yet venerates the old IRA/Easter Rising crew, is inconsistent, and partitionist in mindset. Plenty of people do that, including the entire Dublin establishment (and even the Queen laid a wreath to the old IRA!). But if you want to get them to say *why* the PIRA are so different from the old IRA, they simply can't. They'll just say ""that's totally different"", use ""scum/filth/terrorists/murdering bastards"" but not elaborate. It's a massive problem in the Irish psyche, and is evidently continuing in this thread.

The reason so many people buy into the state narratives (and you'll find this especially with people over 40) is that in the 70s and 80s, channels of information were dominated by state and commercial media - BBC, ITV, RTE, broadsheet newspapers. There was no internet disseminating citizen journalism, no uploading footage to YouTube of police brutality, and crucially no leaks from the security services coming out. Sinn Fein had their own press but as with all niche publications, it was hard to disseminate and procure. Nowadays in any conflict you'll get young people on whatever side broadcasting their first-hand experience of conflict. Sinn Fein was censored from both the Irish and British media (comedically not being allowed to broadcast their voice, so Gerry Adams' dialogue being spoken by an actor for example). Rebel music was banned from the airwaves. Therefore all people got was the ""terrorist"" narrative. One can say that the BBC was just reporting ""the truth"" but there was a massive influence from central government about how the IRA was portrayed. [A BBC documentary where they interviewed Martin McGuinness at home with his wife and children (rather than eating their hearts) nearly brought down the BBC, and caused a mass strike by the NUJ](http://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/dec/12/mondaymediasection.northernireland).

true,VincentKompanini,,Old Growler,"&gt; I try to listen to everything and anything with metal, but it's so repetitive and the community slates EVERYTHING original, or at least cries plagiarism everywhere these days. It's a dying genre locally, being taken over by a small electronic scene that is rapidly gaining ground.

Sounds like metal fans are digging their own genre's grave, to an extent. It's one thing if most of the stuff being produced is unoriginal, but if they slate the small amount of stuff that does sound new then they only have themselves to blame I suppose.

Yeah I tend not to discuss my gun-based hobbies with people unless I know they're sound or if they show a genuine interest. It's frustrating to see people think you're sick in the head just for shooting paper or clays. A lot of people have an even bigger problem with game shooting, so I keep that very quiet IRL.

There have always been those willing to risk their bodies to defend society against fascism, and you don't just start fighting against fascism when it takes a majority hold in the country. The fact is fascists don't just rally, they actively pursue their ideology. 

The fact you equalise them is pathetically ignorant. How many antifascists have planted bombs, attacked innocent people because of their religion or the colour of their skin, how many terrorist attacks have antifascists been involved, how many murderers? There's no comparison to be made. In fact ANTIFA, the militant antifascist movement that does participate in violence is radically different. ANTIFA were the force that drove Combat18 of the streets (an organisation that called for the hanging of blacks and participated in many violent attacks). The difference between even the violent wing of the antifascist movement and fascists is incomparable; of course that stark difference goes unrecognised if you fetishise form over content. Both indeed use violence, but there's a radical difference in using violence to defend people, and using it to attack people, most don't usually fail to recognise that gap (that just fail to apply it consistently usually ending their consistency at the level of the state and war), however those that do i.e. 'pacifists', are as George Orwell said *""objectively proto-fascist""* (since absolving yourself of responsibility in an attack places you on the side of the aggressor).

However the truth is much more sinister and Amsterdam as well as other parts of holland are refuges of sick criminal activity.

take for example howard ""mr nice"" marks.

Supposedly a nice person hence his name, but would a nice criminal be doing hanging around with nasty underworld figures?

Mr Nice is an act, Howard Marks is a sly businessman.

Here is a catalouge for the first cannabis seedbank in amsterdam ""the seedbank"", this later became sensi seeds after the man pictured Neville martin schoenmaker cannabis breeder and Heroin Addict.

http://imgur.com/gzpfh61

A desperate man he left Australia to ""recover""(take) heroin in holland and made a business selling cannabis seeds (seeds are legal in uk and other countries,germinating them isnt.)

The offical story doesn't add up how does someone move from australia to amsterdam and set up a business when they are an impoverished smack head. Answer they are in the international drugs trade and volunteer to be a patsy for the real criminals/breeders such as howard marks. In the picture you can clearly see he high out of his mind on heroin.

later he took the fall for a american bust of the seedbank see the wikipedia article. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neville_Schoenmaker.

So who control marks and his buddies: The Anglo/Dutch/American Criminal Network operated by the same people who finance the Anglo Dutch Bank/Shell ectcetra. The businessmen (who make money in illegal/legal means and dont care corrupt illuminati/freemasons).

Take a look at this london gang pushing drugs who talked to the daily mail first if the daily mail knows a gang that pushes skunk why dont they report them to the police instead of chatting to them. Its a promotion piece, despite what it says use of cannabis has fallen by young people over the last ten years.

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"What has to change is the pathetic way in which you seem to frame Muslims as the ""Poor moderate muslims, if only they weren't Muslims""

Sod you and sod that. I tell you what I'm intolerant of - people who think that they truly understand the concept of freedom yet deny people's right to be themselves in any context.

You know what I'm intolerent of.. people who think that by couching their own troubling essentilaism in the veneer of  respectability they can somehow cloak they nature of what they actually think.

You seem to think that by qualifying your answers you can get away with the vile content of your postings so far. So I'm gonna put you straight big boy.

Let's rock and rolla. 

Lesson one - what is ""Islam"" , please define it. Is it Sufi, Hanafi, Hambali, Shafi, Shia Ithna-asheri , Shia Ismaili or other? IS there one ""Islam"" that you can actually refer to , if so which is it? Which is the true ""Islam? Of the 1.2 billion people in the world.. which is the true version that you speak of? 

You don't actually know. But you don't need to know. What you're doing is setting up a big amorphous mess - those people, them, the other. The one that you can point to and feel superior. 

So , of this mythical Islam.. which is it that has the fringe? And does that Fringe exist? 

What about the social factors, around 77% of ethnic minorities in this coutnry live in around 88% of the poorest buroughs in the UK. Of those that identify themselves as Muslim.. 90% are ethnic minorities. 

Why isn't there a cohesive argument for poverty and lack of life chances being a factor in people's problems? Why reach for Islam? 

Simple, because you can use Islam to scare people, where as the idea that poverty affects chances is proven by research and it would undermine your argument that there's something ""essentially wrong with Islam"". 

I don't see you arguing that there's something wrong with Catholics/ Protestants in in NI. Why not. If you were comparing categories that would be the case, but you're not. Because you're not interested. 

You're busy being a propagandist.

The intolerance to free speech argument would work, if the right to free speech was protected in this country. It isn't. It's conditional. Yet, you don't seem to have a problem with anyone else. NO..You're copying good old Douglas Murray when you say ""there are problems with Islam"".. so we've got your number. 

And I've said this before about offence - without understanding the mythology and symbology of language any discussion of offence is pretty meaningless. It's uniformed gripping by people who can't be arsed to read the reams of philosophy on the subject. 

What HAS to change is that people expect everything can be explained by Islam per se, as if Islam is divorced from social context, economics, regional and international politics. 

What HAS to change is people like you being allowed to get away with uniformed bollocks about FGM and other such things, when it can be proven in fact by research that you're talking your hat.

I've always said Europa League is a curse, and the lads know that. Nothing is worse than playing in Latvia on a Thursday, then going to Norwich away on Sunday. We need a Champions League to progress and the money it will bring into the club is on a completely different level to the Europa League, as well as the calibre of player we can get in. Dare I say it, but Romelu might stay if we get CL.

I honestly think all our fixtures are winnable. Everton at Goodison is the biggest game in Moyes season (in my opinion). He's coming back with a new supposedly superior team. How many times has Moyes' Utd risen up to expectations and played well in a big game? Once, against Olympiakos. He's gona fucking bottle it. We've already beat them once, we're gona do it again. We've always played well against City. That 3-1 game earlier on in the season was actually a pretty good result considering most teams got out of there about 7-0. We can definitely beat them. Arsenal are the only team in that group that I think we could slip up on.

Essentially they are. Problem is, the genre has become such a cluster-fuck of sub-genres that it no longer has any identity due to the internal conflicts within the genre's community itself. ""What's that? DOOM METAL? How fucking bizzare, I listen to Death Metal..."" Great. Wonderful. 

That and beard-nazism. Christ.

&gt; Yeah I tend not to discuss my gun-based hobbies with people unless I know they're sound or if they show a genuine interest.

true,YoungFoxyandFree,present,null,"I like Rodgers. I like Sturridge. Liverpool play great football. That said, Liverpool just leaves a bad taste in my mouth since the Rafa era (there is definitely a rivalry there). Also, (no offense to you personally) in my experience I find the fans unbearable. When they go through bad years they either disappear or go on about their history. When they are relevant again, their team is full of gods and its all shit talk (Gerrard &gt; Lampard, etc). Sore losers and bad winners in my opinion.

I'd rather City win than Liverpool because I think they have the best all around team and have been expected to win the whole season. They win and its no big deal. If Liverpool win they certainly deserve it, but there will be no end to it by the fans. I will still be rooting against both teams though since we still have Liverpool head to head which I know we can win. What I don't know is if we can have a perfect record the rest of the season without the strike force to break down teams who put 11 behind the ball. If we can't pull it off this season though, Jose will get his striker in the summer and take it from there and see what happens between the 3 teams.

I couldn't care less about the money bags at City. That is the way football is now. I don't understand this romantic view of football that its all about the game and money shouldn't matter. When the players themselves start staying at their home clubs and turn down big money, then I might be anti-big money investment. Also, Liverpool has had their share of rich investors in the past. They just happened to have finances well before most other clubs so they have history. Man U has always had money too. SAF is one of, if not the, greatest managers of all time, but he also hit the internet bubble in the early 90s making his club one of the first great worldwide brands. His rise at Man U could not have come at a better time. Those two teams have the most history in English football, yet people seem to forget all this and think they won the right way, whatever that is.

Imagine for you that your biggest goal threat (Suarez) was injured for literally the whole season, Imagine if your best midfielder (Gerrard) was injured for half the season, imagine if your creative force (Coutinho) and best defender (Skrtel) were all injured AT THE SAME TIME.

Arsenal when we had 8 injuries in October-November were still winning pretty much every game, but we coped because we still had Ramsey. Now he's gone along with Walcott and Ozil (and Wilshere) our midfield is fucked. Wilshere is backup for Ramsey, that just shows our depth in midfield, but both are injured so we're fucked.

I wouldn't even make a single excuse if only one or two of our players was injured, but it's the fact that it's literally our 2 biggest goal threats have been injured for at least half the season that makes me think we were unlucky compared to other clubs, along with Ozil. This squad without all those players will still probably get 80 points and the FA Cup.

Up until Walcott and Ramsey got injured we were one of the best sides in Europe. That just goes to show that this squad is clearly top 4 material, we lead the table for 3 months ffs.

I rate what Rodgers has done but Wenger's a better manager. Looks like Wenger will win more than Rodgers this year anyway.

If you think Arsenal can do better than Wenger then you don't really understand football. Yes we haven't won anything for 8 years but Arsenal didn't have the expectations of a top club in that period - from our spending we should have had the expectations of Everton but still overachieved especially 2011/12 and 2012/13. We couldn't afford to have any net spend at all for 8 fucking years, but now we can afford to and have bought a world class player thanks to Wenger and that will continue now we have the money. It's clear that Arsenal will continue to progress like we have done this year, and after one year of spending we'll win a trophy. With a striker half the quality of Ozil and fitness of Walcott and Ramsey I'm very confident we'll finish with at least 85 points next season.

4 more points and we're guaranteed to finish above Spurs for 6th place (really 3 points is all that is needed given the massive gulf in goal differential between us).  So one more win and we are guaranteed 6th and to place above Spurs giving us Europa unless they start winning games 10-0 or something.

11 more points puts us above Everton guaranteed and into 5th.

12 more points puts us above Arsenal guaranteed.  So, win 4 of our last 6 and we are guaranteed to be at least 4th.

17 more points puts us above Chelsea guaranteed for 3rd.  So we have to win the rest to be guaranteed a top 3 finish.

Edit:  Well, that's not right.  We can't finish below 7th now, not 8th, as Soton is 8th.  2 more points guarantees us 6th (and Europa), 4 more puts us 5th, 11 more for guaranteed 4th, etc, etc.

There'll need to be redundencies (there's generally about 5 crews per rig, only 4 will be needed if they move to 3/3). There's rumour that those guys will lose time off but get pay rises, but to be honest a lot of them don't seem interested since they're already earning 30-70k a year and an extra 10k doesn't make nearly so much difference to them as losing 6 weeks of time off per year.

Some guys I've talked to are thinking about doing that now before there's a glut of guys trying to get out of the UK sector. I suspect there won't be nearly so many leaving as some do (people like to complain but it's easy, ultimately, to stay put). Some will though.

Norwegian sector is bloody hard to get into, but a lot are saying they might as well go foreign and do 4/4 (based in the UK but working outside the NS) since it'll pay better than NS work and if they're going to be away for 3 they might as well be away for 4.",0,1396217011,null,0,false,0,cgfy3dz,t3_21rmfj,t1_cgfy3dz,t1_cgfxz0l,null,1433138244,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,notnotcitricsquid,null,null,"Purchasing property can be a wonderful and fulfilling endeavour but the cost of renting should not be the reason to do so, it shouldn't even be in the top 5 reasons! Renting is more expensive than *mortgage payments* because rent includes all of the miscellaneous property ownership costs.

Property ownership is very different to renting, although they both solve a common need (a roof over ones head) that's about where the similarities end. If you own a property you have greatly reduced flexibility in every area of your life, from financial to employment, you can't just drop everything and move 200 miles north when you're heavily invested in your own home.

Don't think about renting as wasted money and don't think about home ownership as cheaper than renting, think about home ownership as making a commitment and renting about paying for flexibility. Purchasing a property might be a good decision for you but try not to focus on the money you're ""wasting"" on rent because it can be exceptionally deceptive. As others have mentioned, interest rate rises are likely on the horizon.

true,Rodents210,rose,Rose,"&gt; Her sudden career change seems really unrealistic. Has she ever expressed any interest in teaching on the show?

She worked with children from the beginning, so teaching young children is not a huge leap. Not to mention she's been around for only about 10 episodes, give or take depending on who you consider to count as ""Clara."" Don't try to compare her to people who have been on for seasons.

&gt; The same thing happened with Amy. The Doctor leaves for a bit, and when he comes back, bam, she is a writer.

Actually, she was a model. She became a writer only after she was sent back in time by the Weeping Angels in New York.

&gt; I feel like I don't know the characters, whereas in the RTD era, the companion's careers were a defining trait in their characterization. 

Sounds like rose-colored glasses to me (pun not intended). Let's see...

1. Rose: Shop girl. Completely unimportant other than the occasional ""See, Rose, you're still worth something even though you work at a shop.""
2. Mickey: What did he even do? We know what he went on to do, and that was a character arc for about maybe two episodes, but other than that...
3. Adam: His career is only important as a point of convenience in one episode.
4. Harkness: Time agent and con artist. Only really important in the sense that it gives context to his knowledge of time and his street-smarts. Then he works for Torchwood Three which is only important in one or two episodes of the main series and hardly brought up more than that.
5. Martha: Medical student, later doctor. Only serves to lend context to the fact that she's a book-smart and clever companion. It isn't really important until she leaves to work for UNIT, and even then she seems more like a field agent than a doctor 95% of the time.
6. Donna: Temp. Same case as Rose. ""You still matter even if your job doesn't"" ad nauseam.
7. Wilf: I'm guessing he's retired. If anything was mentioned of his career I didn't pick up on it or it wasn't important enough to remember.
8. Sarah Jane Smith: This one I'll concede was important, but she wasn't around long enough for it to be any sort of ""development,"" and is realy only a follow-up to her previous time on the show.
9. Astrid: Not really important other than why she might want to travel with the Doctor.
10. Christina: Her characterization makes her career more than her career characterizes her. Anything else would not have made much sense with her personality.
11. Adelaide: Well, yeah. It's obviously important for this one episode because her role is her biggest defining factor. I wouldn't argue that her career rounded out her character any, because her career *was* her character.

Now let's look at Moffat's companions...

1. Amy: Starts as a whatever-gram person, then doesn't have time to develop a career because she doesn't come home all the time at first. Later she marries Rory and after the Doctor fakes his death, her adventures with the Doctor led into her gaining more self confidence (and therefore had less compensatory obnoxiousness) and becoming more grounded. She leaves her dead-end job for a career as a model with her own perfume line (Petrichor). She sacrifices her success and her adventures for her husband, where she ends up in a time period that wasn't very conducive to a career for a woman. Writing was one of the most lucrative things she could have done to make her living, and with her adventures in time and space and knowledge of technology throughout time, she had a lot of ""fiction"" she could write.
2. He's a nurse, which is relevant in at least as many episodes as Martha being a medical student.
3. River Song: She's an archaeologist, which is often mentioned, and her decision to become an archaeologist is important to her arc. I won't go further into that because her character arc sparks debate that I don't care to get into.
4. Clara: Starts out as a nanny because it parallels to her alternate self, who was a governess. Other than that, considering Clara has been around for *half a season,* it hardly seems fair to view her through the fond lens of companions past who have lived out their entire arcs to completion. She's been a teacher for two episodes and both were eventful enough that to not have a conversation about it is reasonable. Even if they never addressed it, she's already had as much career=character development as any RTD character, and much less than Amy.

Even if Moffat's characters had less career-based development than RTD (of which I've yet to be convinced), what you're basically saying is that Moffat doesn't use this one very specific method of characterization that was supposedly used in the past, and it's really the only characterization that matters, since you're judging the worth of a character by how much of this one particular trait we see, others be damned.

That means they aren't truely ""monsters"". It's very possible they only do what they need to survive in that state, perhaps even trying to find revenge on gallifrey. Therefore it doesn't seem to weird that the angels may have provided food to the residents.

Here is an interesting point about Ronaldo: In 6 years at United in the Premier League, that 31 goal season was the only time he scored more than 20 in a year. It took him his 4th year to get a double-digital tally, then his 31 goal season, then his last was 17 goals (IIRC).

Juve took a risk with podgba and it was played off. When he arrived he was a promising youngster who left united because they wouldn't play him. When he got there they immediately began playing him because of his promise but it took about half a season to get settled. My friend is a juve fan and even he thought they were rushing pogba and he wasn't ready.

Thiago was slowly introduced into barca starting at 19. A couple of seasons of showing promise but playing second fiddle to xavi and he left for Bayern where he is now playing pretty regularly.

true,harlequinity,WA,wales,"Short memory?

&gt;Jose would never stand for that

Do you not remember Jose's first stint and departure. There was a club statement released saying it was due to a souring of relations between JM and RA. Notably over transfers with RA forcing through the acquisition of several, most notably Shev (another big name striker) against JM's wishes.

Is there any doubt RA likes big names? Not really. And why not, he has a fucking huge yacht, buying obscenely expensive players is just another display of wealth. Can't exactly blame him, I would be equally ostentatious given his circumstances. 

Is there any doubt RA has control over the teams transfers and selections? Transfers, almost no doubt, I think thats been made clear. Selections, more blurred. It wouldn't surprise me if he has in the past had some control. I mean the amount of guys he has sacked suggests he isn't afraid to put pressure on managers.

I agree it seems far fetched, and Jose wouldn't be the man to stand for it, but then last time he didn't stand for it off he went to Italy. I feel managing under RA would be immensely pressured and, considering all of this, perhaps a little give and take to relieve some pressure isn't as far fetched as it may seem at first. 

That is all I am saying. But please downvote away.

true,Saiing,cnty-england,UK -&gt; Japan,"I come from Lewes, so let me shed a bit of light on this.  Basically it's all good natured fun.  Lewes holds what is generally reckoned to be the largest bonfire night celebrations in the UK.  There are a number of Bonfire societies both from within Lewes and the surrounding villages in East Sussex.  Every year they dress in whatever their traditional costumes are (or a theme costume) and process through the streets.

The Cliffe are the self-styled ""bad boys"" of the event.  They are one of the largest of the societies and don't process with the rest for largely historic reasons.  Every year they choose several people who are named as ""enemies of the Cliffe"" who are made into large tableaux (basically huge comical statues) that are filled with explosives, laden with fireworks and dragged through the streets of the town before being set fire to at the Cliffe's main display.  Generally the ""enemies"" are topical characters such as Jimmy Savile or Margaret Thatcher,  but occasionally controversial (one year they burned the manager of the local Barclays Bank because he refused a loan to the society).

The reason our celebrations are so big is because bonfire night coincides with the anniversary do the burning of the Lewes martyrs who were Protestants burned by the catholic authorities many hundreds of years ago.  So there's a lot of mentions of ""no popery"" and anti-catholic banners, but although this sounds pretty bad it's actually all done with a pretty tongue-in-cheek attitude and is light-hearted.

The main procession is always a pretty amazing spectacle, with racing of burning tar barrels and small bangers (known locally as rookies) being thrown around.  It feels incredibly dangerous sometimes but actually there are rarely any issues.  It's all just good fun and a traditional event that brings everyone out for a food night of food, drink and fireworks.",0,1396228539,null,0,false,0,cgg2t1m,t3_21rmie,t1_cgg2t1m,t1_cgfuo2o,null,1433140466,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

true,OWSucks,null,null,"OP is getting a lot of hate for posting this. My perspective: my brother's also a huge Arsenal fan, and even he said today ""I really hope you win the league, to stop City, to stop Chelsea... and, for Gerrard"".

He thinks Gerrard is world class; phenomenal. His actual wording was ""love that guy - so immense"". But more than that, more than an Arsenal fan, and more than a Liverpool fan, he and I both want to see England do well at the World Cup. I know the general consensus for Brazil is that we'll be lucky to get out the group, and we've got no chance of winning the tournament. But who here thought at the start of the season that Liverpool would be lucky to get 4th, and that we had no chance of winning the league?

This World Cup coming will be Gerrard's last, and probably his last game for England as well. Going into the tournament with the captain only needing a World Cup Winner's medal to complete his cabinet would, for the England fans, give the competition something it really doesn't have at the moment - importance.

My point is that there's more than one factor that goes into why a given fan wants a particular result. People in this thread have said that they want Everton to get 4th, despite the local rivalry, because it would be good for football on Merseyside. Anfield Champions League nights are iconic, and it's not just Liverpool fans who know it. Anybody would be attracted to that energy - it's intoxicating.

So if some Arsenal fans want Liverpool to win the league, to stop the big spenders winning it, or because they think Gerrard deserves the medal, or because they want to watch Champions League football at Anfield (starring Suarez), or because they like red more than blue, then good.

I apologize if I came off a little confrontational, I wasn't intending to start an argument, just trying to have a little discussion.

&gt; Do you not remember Jose's first stint and departure. There was a club statement released saying it was due to a souring of relations between JM and RA. Notably over transfers with RA forcing through the acquisition of several, most notably Shev (another big name striker) against JM's wishes.

I agree that Abramovich has had influence in transfers there's no doubt about that. It's also very possible that he has affected team selection in the past. But the point that I was trying to make was that all that stuff was in the past, and that now, 3.5 years later, I find it really hard to believe that Abramovich or anyone else at Chelsea is encouraging Jose to pick Torres over Ba. Don't you think that Mourinho and Abramovich would have discussed this before he came back to Chelsea? It was one of the things that led to Jose parting ways with Chelsea the first time he was here, so I find it hard to believe that he wouldn't make sure things were different this time before coming back. I don't think Jose would be at Chelsea right now if he didn't have 100% control of transfers and team selection. Otherwise he wouldn't be talking about staying for 12 years and building a legacy.

Sorry, I disagree. Look at Liverpool. They weren't bullied by Arsenal or Suarez. They put their foot down and he stayed and he's having the season of his life.

Sure, Bale might've been upset at not being allowed to go to Madrid, but so what? Suarez was **a lot** more upset at not getting his move away from Anfield than Bale would've been had he been made to stay. And now he seems a completely different guy. He loves the club and they're challenging at the heights that he wants his team to challenge.

Yes so we got offered a world-record fee. Hindsight is 20/20 of course but there was no 'bullying' by Real Madrid. Bale had a contract with us and if we wanted him to fulfill it, that should've been that.

It may be culturally insensitive to call an individual Northern Irish person ""British"" (in the same way you might offend a Catalan by calling him ""Spanish"", or calling a Quebecois ""Canadian""), but you wouldn't know without that individual person telling you, and to my knowledge, Rodgers has claimed that he is ""British"".

true,matcht,lfc12,,"I doubt it because not many managers have the faith in their team to outscore the opponent or do they have a strikeforce as good as ours. Playing two up top inevitably leaves you short in other areas, especially in an era where most sides play a 4-2-3-1. We are able to do it because SAS are so effective that they usually make up for our defence.

However even Rodgers has recognised the limitations of this system vs better sides. Perfect example is today's game, where we switched back to a 4-3-3. The better sides (usually) would be able to pick us off on the counter if we played 4-4-2, especially with our porous defence. They would obviously struggle to contain us but it is possible. 

What our use of a variation of the 4-4-2 does show is that it can be very useful against the worser sides in the league. They do not usually possess enough attacking quality to outscore ours. This has worked for City, who also aren't great without the ball. This is why I've been surprised by Chelsea's tactics at times, they are hesitant to play 2 upfront and it's cost them.

Btw, I don't think Mourinho's formation revolutionised anything in England. Look back and you'll see most teams followed Rafa's 4-2-3-1 blueprint, using a double pivot and a lone forward was unusual in England but now most sides use it. Even Mourinho.

Besides, that last yellow is not really easy to pick up if you know what the consequences are (missing two games). If you remember last year, LS7 was on 9 yellows before this stage of the match and it took him about 5 or 6 games to pick up his yellow and deservedly 10 match-ban along with it.

true,Max2tehPower,MX,mexico,"No....but like Mourinho said, it is out of our hands. Prior to Liverpool - Spuds, this is the scenario for Chelsea to win it:  

City has to lose both (or lose one draw one) games to their hardest opponents: Liverpool and Everton away, which seems more likely after their draw at the Emirates.  

Chelsea has to win every single match after Palace, and with the last 3 away matches, it can look good on paper, which are Swansea, Liverpool, and Cardiff. The home games are almost a guarantee win. Despite our bad away form, Swansea look to be a win, since they play possession/passing football, which is perfect for Chelsea's counterattack. Cardiff will be the difficult one, since it will be the last match, and if Cardiff hasn't been relegated by then, then they will be fighting for their lives...so if they decide to play an offensive game, then Chelsea can win it easily, if not, then *gulp*.  

Now, with this scenario, Liverpool has to lose or draw in one of their remaining games outside of Chelsea. One draw allows Chelsea to catch up on points, and even if Chelsea is behind in goal difference, this scenario will put the fate of the title at Anfield against Liverpool for either teams.  

I pray to the football gods to make this happen. Obviously, if City win everything, then City win it. If City choke and Liverpool don't, even a win at Anfield won't be enough for Chelsea.

That's kind of a horrible thing to try and explain to someone mainly because, for me, there are these horrible feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness.  
For me, the thing that really strikes home is the monologue that The Doctor delivers to Merry Galel as she's about to let herself be eaten by the creature she calls Grandfather.  I wish I could find you a good link to it, but it's always embedded in a big wall of text.  He tells her in a whole lot of really gorgeous words that she's important. 

He says, *""Hey. Do you mind if I tell you a story? One you might not have heard. All the elements in your body were forged many many millions of years ago in the heart of a faraway star that exploded and died. That explosion scattered those elements across the desolations of deep space. After so, so many millions of years, these elements came together to form new stars and new planets. And on and on it went. The elements came together and burst apart, forming shoes and ships and sealing wax and cabbages and kings. Until, eventually, they came together to make you. You are unique in the universe. There is only one Merry Galel. And there will never be another. Getting rid of that existence isn't a sacrifice, it's a waste.""*

He tells her she matters.  He makes the universe a beautiful place to hang around in.  Everyone has some kind of worth and beauty to them, because they're a part of that universe.

true,jjones217,num23,,"I agree, and I did mean to add the bit about eastern Europe. However, the Thursday-Sunday bit is worse, in my opinion, because Sunday fixtures isolate your team.

Maybe I'm naive or just don't understand the media culture surrounding football as much as I could yet, but I feel like Saturdays are better:

* Saturdays see nearly the entire Premier League take part in the footballing activities. 

* Non-die-hard fans probably travel and attend better on a Saturday because there's no work the next day and they can hit the pub and get sloshed to their heart's content, whereas Sundays - especially the night caps - require a late return home to an early rise the next morning. Not that Spurs are lacking for ticket sales, I think fans just enjoy the Saturday atmosphere more.

* The spotlight doesn't shine so squarely on your club on Saturdays. I mean, sure, if you're in the hunt for the Top 4, then  the media will be all over you anyway. But the lone (or 1 of 2) Sunday night fixtures give the media an extra 24 hours to scrutinize *your* club. If things go badly, as they are in North London right now, the media are vultures and will try to get to the dirt faster than Eto'o in the penalty area.

* The players aren't as distracted by yesterday's results. Yes, I know,  professional footballers aren't supposed to be distracted like that, but it happens. And i know that an opponent losing the day before could be a boon to your energy and drive to win; but it could also put more pressure on you. 

My view: you play on Saturday and you are one in 16 other teams doing so, the media doesn't pay as much attention, you aren't distracted by results - it's just you and your side focusing on getting the 3 points for that day.",0,1396237682,null,0,false,0,cgg6obg,t3_21skxo,t1_cgg6obg,t1_cgg6a6q,null,1433142355,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

The best thing I can suggest, for your peace of mind, is for you guys to talk to the council before your neighbour does.

The local council will have as many problems with neighbours making unreasonable complaints as they will with people making too much noise, so will probably be able to advise you.

From the sounds of it, you have nothing to worry about from the council - someone mentioned that their local council doesn't do anything about car alarms going off in the middle of the night.

IMO dogs barking are a totally normal part of everyday life, as long as they're not at it constantly for hours.

I think I'd try to find something to act as a sop to his complaints - some way to meet him in the middle, even if he's being unreasonable.

You can get [doorbells with two buttons for about £15](http://www.meteorelectrical.com/wirefree-portable-door-chime-kit.html), why don't you replace your current doorbell with one of these, give him the second button and tell him to press it any time the dogs are bothering him.

I haven't thought this through fully, so I'm undecided whether or not it's really a good idea, but I get the impression that you're trying to combat his complaints, rather than soothe the situation. He may be totally unreasonable and not conducive to soothing, of course, but if you can find some way for him to notify you (text you or tweet you?) before he gets angry, then that might prevent the antagonism.

It'd also be worth explaining to him that shouting at dogs doesn't work to quiet them, because the dogs think of it as him barking at them, and thus it's their job to bark back.

Jan is a fantastic defender, one of the best in Europe, and if we don't want him i'm sure Barcelona will be happy to take him off our hands. You have to remember that a) he's bedding into a new manager (tim) who's been a big jerk to his best friends at the club (Nacer in Jan, Eriksen &amp; Moussa by keeping them off the field for Bentaleb) and we're not taking the steps forward i'm sure he was promised. He'll be fine after we get in a real manager this summer.

Dawson is 32. That's kind of everything that needs to be said; he hasn't adjusted for the drop in fitness/pace, etc. that goes with being ""old"".

Kaboul is still not fully fit, and even if he is, (which again, I don't believe) he also has to shake off more than a year of rust at this point. He's still getting his legs back under him from being out for a very long time due to injury, but he's a very good player, and I have every confidence he'll be back to form next year if we re-sign him.

And finally, remember this; it's not just the defense who looks like they dont' care.

And frankly, I don't think our ""should win"" games are necessarily going to be that easy.

* West Ham: it's away against a team with (generally) capable defense and an ability to park the shit out of the bus (see: Chelsea match). Also, they have a spurned former Liverpool attacker (they always seem to score against us) who is pretty much the type of player we're worst at defending (big guy who can head in lofty crosses).

* Norwich: OK yeah, this one we should win.

* Crystal Palace: again, it's away at a ground with fantastic support. Also, they just beat Chelsea there. Yeah, we're more of an attacking threat than Chelsea, but given that it's so late in the season and they may be in a relegation battle, I don't think this game is likely to be that easy.

* Newcastle: at home, so really should be a win, but even sans cabaye you can't always trust newcastle to lose when they're supposed to.

TL;DR every game's a cup final. I think the correct strategy is just to go all out to win the next game every time. Once we've beaten West Ham, *then* we can worry about who's available for City.

All of the above will be a year older and more experienced (with a title run in no less). Over the next three years you will see them approach their peak (ideally). You can see a spine emerging here. The midfield is starting to look good even a few years down the line. 

In perspective: Mignolet is 26, Suarez 27, Lucas 27, Agger 29, Skrtel 29, Gerrard 33.

When the time comes for the older lads to hang up their boots, we'll have plenty of time to recruit by then.

On a more serious note I wouldn't say we're more pessimistic just more cynical in out look, if that makes any sense?

The outlook in the UK I could become Prime Minster but I know that the likely hood of this happening is basically nil even if I work really hard. In America*, the outlook is, I could become Prime Minster (or President) but only if I work very hard. The UK outlook seems pessimistic due to the fact that maybe we consider harsh truths a little bit more, maybe take said truths a bit too much?

I wouldn't say we enjoy anyone failing, only the people who deserve it, after all we do love an under dog story. Let's say there was an orphan boy/girl and they worked up their way up the greasy pole but was a snob and was just awful to everyone. When they fail we would mock them as they deserve it. If said orphan boy/girl was nice we wouldn't mock them as they tried their best. 

Why should we be happy for the sake of being happy? After all happiness is not the normal state for a human being, being neutrally indifferent is. If I'm happy all the time then how will I know when something makes me truly happy?

*America as in the Americas, particularly Canada and the US.

The debates are useful things to hold- they get the party back into the limelight a bit. Though, I wouldn't be surprised to hear that the audience for the things is overwhelmingly made up of people who've already made their minds up on the topics. 

I'm not too hot on the *Party of IN* campaign slant. While it's a nice feeling to be campaigning for a party that's, for a change, *unequivocally* on the right side of the argument, it's hardly likely to be much of a vote winner- it's going to be quite successful in hardening the remnants of the core base, I expect, but precious little besides. Those who're concerned by job losses aren't going to vote Lib Dem on the issue when the arena for the decisions concerned is as remote as Brussels- they're going to vote Labour, ""to send a message"".

First off, unemployed programmers are really in abundance here at the moment, from what I've been told.

Secondly, most of the tech jobs in the UK are in the south, where it is more expensive to live. If you avoid London you would be looking at the Reading, Basingstoke, Swindon area mainly. But a lot of the jobs would be in London, which would likely be out of your price bracket considering the three of you would have to live off of the one salary as you mentioned.

Your best bet is for your wife to either search for jobs in the north, or as I said outside London in the south if nothing turns up in the north.

true,vasticles,null,null,"Yea yea, injuries ruined our midfield, blah blah blah. Every team has injuries throughout the season. Yes, there's an element of luck involved: some teams get away with fewer injuries than others. However, there are many other contributing factors to dealing with injuries and their effect on the teams' seasons. Training methods, conditioning, physios, schedules and ultimately - the depth of the squad. 

Wenger is a good coach, but a stingy one. He's got a degree in economics ffs. You say injuries to Ramsey, Walcott, Ozil and Wilshere. Hell, it doesn't take a genius to admit that you need to prepare some backups for those boys. Especially since Arsenal's schedule is a busy one with 4 competitions and all. All of those lads, save for Ozil, are injury prone. Just look at the past seasons and tell me I'm wrong. Spend some money and get some cover!

Now, take Ozil. A class player no doubt, but he is coming in from La Liga, which is significantly less physically demanding than BPL. Playing for Madrid, he would always get subbed in the second half. Runs out of steam, fizzles out, gets disinterested, whatever. Do you really expect him to deliver intensity throughout the entire 90 if he has never consistently have done it before, let alone in a tougher league? Poor man management. He's 25, give the man a rest more often in his first season.

If you wanna challenge on all 4 fronts, get some proper depth. Look at City and Chelski. Hard to admit, but that is how it's done. Wenger should've known this. But he's cheap. He's a good coach, because he keeps you competitive and consistently gets you into the top 4 without spending too much. He is phenomenal with the youth. For the owners, it's fantastic. He makes them a killing, while spending little! For the fans, it's horseshit. If I was an Arsenal fan, I would be frustrated to the bone, especially if I lived in London and paid those outrageous ticket prices. How on earth does it not make you livid? Constantly hoping that your team will not choke like it always does in late season, and then watch it choke and then finally settle for mediocrity.

I truly do hope that you win the FA cup. Arsenal fans deserve that much. But as far as blaming your season on injuries, I think you're being just a smidge too naive. ",0,1396253712,null,0,false,0,cggb0r2,t3_21r871,t1_cggb0r2,t1_cgfxzat,null,1433144402,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Full year as a member of the Barclays Premier League

Total revenue increased 213% to £71.8m (2012: £22.9m) with average league attendances up from 26,427 to 30,807

Broadcasting income grew from **£5.6m** in 2011/12 to **£46.9m** in 2012/13

Matchday income of £11.8m in 2011/12 has risen to £16.9m in 2012/13

Commercial income increased from £4.8m in 2011/12 to £6.7m in 2012/13

Profit before player trading increased to £8.7m but with an overall net loss of £7.1m. Player trading included a one-off exceptional cost of a £2.1m impairment charge to write off the carrying value of certain players

The loss before interest and tax has reduced to £6.6m (2012: £11.9m loss)

**Club wage to turnover ratio reduced to 65%** (2012:102% after the removal of exceptional bonuses)

Total group wages, including player wages, increased to £47.1m in 2013 from £28.7m in 2012

**At 30 June 2013 (balance sheet date) there were £21m of committed transfer fees still to be paid and since this date a further £27m of player transfers were negotiated (in the 2013/14 season). Whilst £21m has been paid in this current season, £27m will still be owed from 30 June 2014, with £22m of this being due in 2014/15 alone**

A £5.6m loan was taken out with Vibrac in September 2012 to enable the Club to take advantage of a lower transfer instalment payment by paying earlier, and so reduce overall cash outflows and liabilities

Expenditure on the total training ground project now anticipated to exceed £30m. The first phase of the build is expected to open this summer

**Further investment from the shareholder in the year was £12.5m, with another £2.2m in September 2013 bringing the total investment since acquisition to achieve promotion to the Barclays Premier League to £52.7m. £37.9m of this has been converted into equity shares in the year bringing net liabilities down to £1.6m from £32.4m in 2012**",0,1396255221,null,0,false,0,cggb9bh,t3_21tc3e,t1_cggb9bh,t3_21tc3e,null,1433144514,5,false,SaintsFC,t5_2tboa,5

You'll find cheap prices everywhere, just depends on the quality of the house and area you want to deal with. I'm in a very boring ""family"" area. But that's OK, as I've got family. 

BTW, I negotiated down from £950pcm. I also negotiated a previous place down from £1100 to £1000 but I chose not to take it in the end. Just ask for a discount, it can't hurt.

The houses in St Ives come and go very quickly, so there are always lots of places to choose from and the competition allows negotiation. It's a renter's market.

That's especially the case given many tall buildings are on the site of old ones, and the planning requirements for new ones are sufficiently high that they generally look pretty attractive. Many other developments are in areas specifically designed for this, such as Canary Wharf.

London has some of the most expensive cost of land in the world and needs housing. Do we want other major cities to overtake it because they have the office and housing space available? Or do we want to spend lots on commuter transport and destroy greenbelt land?


This article would be useful if it gave specific details of specific developments that would be problematic and why. This is just vague fear mongering.

Edit: and complaining about developments in Stratford and Elephant and Castle seems a bit weird - they're pretty crap but it isn't due to tall buildings.

As to whether his objections have merit, that is another issue.

Unfortunately there is a stigma in UK against high rise residential because of the association with nasty post-war council blocks, but it can be done in a stylish and progressive way.

A capital city that revolves around and is based entirely on the generation of money. London is open for business if you have the potential to generate wealth and/or you're already wealthy. It's becoming more and more closed off if you don't. 

My problem with gentrification is - and I've seen it happen to a couple of areas in London I've lived ( Portobello road and Kensal Green ) also the area where I live now ( Queens Park )  is that when money moves in, culture is pushed out. 

It's one of the reasons the girl and I are thinking of moving away. I mean I work in the music industry, she works for the press. We both feel that we're being pushed out of ( or more to the point we no longer fit into ) the area we live as it's been/being gentrified beyond recognition even though we own a property and can therefore afford to live pretty comfortably here. 

Basically we don't want to live in a purely money driven environment.

Tactically - Sterling's in great form and Liverpool's fullbacks are questionable defensively, so don't play a useless Championship-level wannabe-winger leftback behind a player who's also poor at pressing and tracking back. Play someone who'll hassle Johnson and win the ball off him (Chadli would do in a pinch) and whoever you can find who can actually defend (admittedly that person might not currently exist in our squad).

You can't separate the two though. One of the reasons why Putin is such an 'operator' is because of this authoritarian personally, and because he has the option to quell all opposition by sending in the police to arrest them. It's like me saying I admire Hitler because of what he did for the German economy, but not because of the war and genocide stuff. The two are naturally interlinked, and you cannot separate them.

Plus, for a so called 'libertarian', I would not expect him to support such an authoritarian figure, even if he is 'an operator'. 

&gt; On Merkel, Farage said: ""She is incredibly cold. I always say – I agree this is a bit rude – but whatever you think of the public image of Merkel, in private she is even more miserable. I warm to more extrovert people.""

What a surprise. Will Nigel ever say something about the EU, or relating to the EU which isn't negative? I can understand an anti-EU stance, but he's taken it to the point where he'll criticise Euston Station because it has the letters E and U at the start. It seems completely deluded to me.

&gt; Cameron is ""a perfectly nice fellow who stands four-square for nothing,""

Other than policies related to the EU, what does Farage stand for? Smoking in pubs? People in glass houses comes to mind.

&gt; Miliband a ""nice chap, not very worldly – I would love to see him in a working men's club in Newcastle""

Yes, the best way to judge a politician is how they would perform in a working man's club, not actually in politics. Personally, I always vote for the best 'bloke', not the person I think will represent my views the best.

&gt; Pressed to pick between Cameron and Miliband, Farage said: ""Don't give a damn. Ed has come up with some pretty bonkers ideas.""

I was on the other side of noise complaints two years ago, when an upstairs neighbour would let his kids ride scooters along all the open balconies of the flats. They sounded louder than any passing helicopter or jet, and would go on for 10 minutes because the kids would each ride in a different direction from their front door, then down the stairs, then cross each other, then down the other stairs etc. And when they got to the bottom, they'd start back up again!

I talked to the neighbour, whom I thought he was being twatty with his teflon-shouldered responses (they're just kids, they're just playing I took them to the park two weeks ago), but I'm sure he thought the same of me for daring to question his parenting. The sound stopped in any case. Maybe he just didn't realise before how loud they were?

I felt like a load had been lifted, as for over the last few months, I was spending ever weekend waiting for the noise, then stopping what I was doing when it was going on. I'm sure you feel something similar in waiting for the dreaded council.

tl;dr: Talk to the neighbour (record the conversation if you're worried he'll use it as an excuse for trouble), and listen to his complaint, as well as explaining your position.

But the point about going outside - it is perfectly acceptable to keep any aged cat indoors for its entire life. It requires a bit more commitment of keeping your kitten/cat active by playing with it, but it dramatically reduces the risk of many deadly diseases and injuries. You're cat won't be at risk of FIV, cat bite abscesses, being hit by cars, stolen by neighbours, as well as any number of parasites and infections.

Most adoption agencies won't adopt out if you don't have access to a garden, but I've had my cat indoors an she does just fine.

He's got the port where he can expand his military influence. He has ensured more buffer zone between himself and the West. He's got everything he wanted and he has lost absolutely nothing.

And he knows that we will just sit around condemning everything and doing fuck all while he rolls tanks around. There was basically 0% risk for Putin to do what he did. And every day he is strengthening his grip on Crimea while we sit around whining. All we have to fight back is a few token sanctions that hurt nobody important in any meaningful way. Nobody here cares enough about Ukraine or Crimea to start a war, so it's basically there for him to take and he can laugh about it while we cry like little bitches.

The only clever comeback we have against Russia is to get ourselves energy independent. Then we don't need to give a shit about them and they can die in obscurity.

[Tell that to NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlargement_of_NATO). 

&gt;  Crimean based were rented to Russians and I could see no problem in continuing such rental

NATO would, that's kind of the point of their expansion and the marginalisation of Russia.

This has nothing to do with communism and it's demise hasn't lessened the importance of the Great Game. We've been fighting Russia over these lands since long before Marx was born. The end of communist rule didn't mark the end of east/west rivalries. 

&gt; he knew exactly how West would behave and that Ukrainians aren't capable of defending themselves.

80% of that region were always going to side with Russia so the definition of ""themselves"" is open to debate in Crimea. Hence the current outcome being predicable. When The Council of Foreign Relations (i.e. CIA) decided to fund the Ukrainian opposition groups they undoubtedly discussed this and likely wrote it off as a likely but acceptable loss. 

Yes, you can argue that Russia got that situation via a form of ethnic cleansing (population migration) but that's where we are today. 

&gt; Yes, they wouldn't do it over them, unless Ukraine was in NATO

Even being in NATO isn't good enough. See Georgia in 2008. You need to be ""attacked"" to invoke NATO protection (hence Turkey recently being caught trying to stage a false flag from Syria).

At first, the stories that came out I totally agreed with. Things like google, Facebook, apple etc all cooperating with the NSA. Or that encryption standards can't be trusted. Or mass collection of email and internet history. Those are genuine public interest stories and I supported him releasing them. I assume that all the other documents were things of a similar nature.

But the recent stories are not. Tapping Merkels phone or bugging EU offices is a genuine intelligence activity and I think it's wrong for someone to disclose that.

The problem is public transport wont become better unless people use it, people wont use it because they have cars, and most car drivers dont care where they park as long as they don't get fined....Unfortunately society has a whole suffers. And I think unfortunately it should be drivers who are penalized. 

The other option is we nationalise buses, or give them government cash to to improve the coverage and trips. Past that Im all out of suggestions.

true,pharao007,null,null,"&gt; He didn't say ""I admire Vladimir Putin"", rather he said Putins leadership over his country and his actions on the world stage was superior to others.

Is this some kind of different language or what? There was a clear question, ""WHICH CURRENT LEADER DO YOU ADMIRE?"". If Farage wanted to mention Putin, how about starting with ""Admiration is a wrong word here but I certainly...."". Just because Farage didn't say ""I do admire Putin"" it doesn't mean he meant it through the sentence. Jeez.

&gt;People defend and attack Farage on many websites, he makes some valid points and some bad ones.

But too many people don't acknowledge these and desperately defend Farage, even in such idiotic statements. To me that is very radical, when a person is so blindly defending a politician, he would agree to anything he says/does.

&gt;why are you so obsessive with attacking him?

It's a free world. Why wouldn't I argue some points and comments made by him and his party? Especially when I see some loonies who will lie, just to prove their beloved Farage is not in the wrong. I'm giving an opinion, which usually proves them otherwise.

I don't like Farage and his party for his anti-EU and anti-immigration rhetoric and yes, I'm an immigrant myself so you may say I do it in my own interest. I voice concerns with such things though as other people simply don't care about them and later we have whole immigrant bashing, which at the end of the day can mean me and other immigrants are affected by such. Because I follow the topic I also have knowledge, which many don't and simply aren't bothered looking at. Just to let you know, I've won a PCC case against the Daily Mail, which was using EU and non-EU immigration numbers to make a point of EU-migration. obviously I can't prove them they did it on purpose but at least they're going to change the article and make a clarification.

Farage to me is a right wing nearly radical and as long as I value fair point and would gladly discuss it, Farage, his party, some Tories and for example The Daily Mail have very non-objective discussion, based often on lies and exaggeration.

&gt;You've posted numerous articles about Farage to many subs over the past few days

One news was put on two subs so that r/europe also has a chance to see it. One was about NHS. Other about most recent comment following a well known debate. You are just doing exactly what Farage and some papers do, exaggeration, just to prove their point. Also, what the hell is wrong to post threads which are most interesting to me?

I think Farage is playing off the negative view most people take on events such as the Iraq war and the war in Afghanistan, where western powers were very quick to get into long and bloody conflicts which lead to the death of a lot of people and not much else. 

He is contrasting that with Putins non violent approach to recent conflicts, such as Syria, where the world was ready to enter another violent conflict with questionable groups on both sides, and Russia was able to negotiate the surrender of chemical weapons without anyone having to invade. Making him look like the good guy, wanting peace without having to resort to violence. 

Many people believe the west's approach would have ended in another Afghan like conflict, and believe a non invasive approach like Russia's was preferable.  

The same can be said with the Crimea conflict, most people don't agree with what Putin has done, but he certainly did it in a much less bloody way than the US or their allies would have done if they had the same intentions. 

That is where the admiration comes from, the ability to be a global player, and to stand up for your nations interests. The ability to project a strong image, without having to resort to actual violence. 

Obviously that is a simplification of what Putin has been doing, and how Russia is governed as a whole, but on the international stage Putin has shown himself recently to be a strong influential leader who gets what he wants.

Am I the only one who posts about UKIP and Farage on Reddit? And even if I did what is wrong with it? I see Farage like that and share articles about it. If you see anything wrong with other politicians just do the same. Couple of minutes later the same article was posted by someone else....

&gt;He's pretty damn smart actually.

Sending own army to other country is being smart? Not really dude, no. It's bullying. Using own force for the personal gain. He was more smarter when he somehow put pro-Russia politicians few years after orange revolution. That was way smarter as it wasn't such obvious.

Tell me something. Have you looked at history of Europe during and after II WW. Tell me, how is it possible that Poland was invaded by Russia and Germany, Germans later decided to attack Russians (and it was for all of us one of their ""best"" decisions) and when war came to the end, it was Russia who gained new territories and influences upon all countries (puppet-states)?

Would you call Stalin smart? From one point of view, yes. From the other (and the whole rest) no. He was a selfish dictator, who didn't care about human beings, just for the gain of the USSR (and obviously himself). Why the West allowed for Stalin to take over whole Eastern Europe? Fur fun? No, it was because they didn't want to continue war but this time fight Stalin. Stalin wouldn't mind fighting though, after all, it was millions of his own people who would die, not him. Not saying about his approach where he killed millions of Russians himself (by his orders).

true,Obidom,cnty-uk,Cheshire,"&gt;One estimate, from the Digital Citizens Alliance - a group backed by rights holders - suggested that piracy websites worldwide generated $227m (£137m) from advertising revenue each year.

Says it all....

&gt;The Infringing Website List (IWL) will be an ""up-to-date list of copyright infringing sites"" that can be cross-referenced by those third parties, in the hope that they will pull their advertising from those sites.

Who decides if a website is infringing?

&gt;""If an advert from an established brand appears on an infringing website not only does it lend the site a look of legitimacy, but inadvertently the brand and advertiser are funding online crime,"" said Detective Chief Inspector Andy Fyfe from the City of London Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit (Pipcu).

two things, firstly some advertising is generated automatically, not manually placed, secondly, fucking PIPCU, Privated police force paid for by Rights Holders....

&gt;The City of London said a pilot of the IWL carried out last year resulted in a 2% reduction in advertising from major household brands on the identified illegal websites.

&gt;

&gt;__Harold Fredrick Shipman__  (14 January 1946 – 13 January 2004) was a British [doctor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician) and [one of the most prolific serial killers in recorded history by proven murders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_serial_killers_by_number_of_victims) with up to 250 murders being ascribed to him.

&gt;On 31 January 2000, a jury found Shipman guilty of 15 murders. He was sentenced to [life imprisonment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment) and the judge recommended that he never be released.

&gt;After his trial, the [Shipman Inquiry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shipman_Inquiry), chaired by Dame [Janet Smith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Smith_(judge\)), began on 1 September 2000. Lasting almost two years, it was an investigation into all deaths certified by Shipman. About 80% of his victims were women. His youngest victim was a 41-year-old man.  Much of Britain's legal structure concerning health care and medicine was reviewed and modified as a direct and indirect result of Shipman's crimes. Shipman is the only British doctor who has been found guilty of murdering his patients.

Obviously NATO doesn't have to be used solely for the ""fight"" with Russia and can be used as a common military power in any world conflict, which can affect NATO members directly.

&gt;NATO would, that's kind of the point of their expansion and the marginalisation of Russia.

Would, could, should. Then it would be a Russia's problem. They could move their bases somewhere else. After all it's the country's final decision who it wants to support and what foreign army to have on its own land.

&gt;We've been fighting Russia over these lands since long before Marx was born.

Yeah, read on Wiki about Crimea's history. It changed hands very often and in fact I think it is ethnic Tatars who should be given more right and all about Crimea, as they were mass expelled by Stalin.

&gt;80% of that region were always going to side with Russia so the definition of ""themselves"" is open to debate in Crimea.

Nothing wrong with having international observers or even UN making sure that the vote in Crimea is legal et al. If Ukraine wanted closer ties with the EU, they would know that treating people in discriminatory fashion wouldn't be a good sign for the EU. After all it's the EU who wants more liberal and equal stuff, not Putin!

He ended the problems in Crimea with very little bloodshed, while bettering his own nations interests.

Compare that the the recent intentional affairs most people in the UK will be familiar with. What comes to mind, war, conflict, death.

Kalas will be loaned out next season.

Let's evaluate next year's squad including possible loan recalls for depth.

LB - Azpi, PVA
RB - Ivanovic, Azpi.

Ideally here we bring in Luke Shaw.  We immediately have a 3 man rotation between Dave, Ivanovic, and Shaw with PVA here as cover.

CB - Terry Cahill Luiz Zouma.  We are fine here unless we sell Luiz

Pivot - MVG, Matic, Ramires, Lampard, Luiz, Chalobah

At this point Frank should be a pinch hitter, subbing in for a game if needed due to injuries but being used off the bench similar to Mikel if we want to drop to a 3 man midfield. There is always the chance Luiz and/or Ramires are shipped out.  MVG coming off an injury shouldn't be looked at as an every game starter.  Room for a permanent oartner for Matic.  Chalobah needs a full hear in the EPL before coming back to Chelsea

AM - Schurrle, Hazard, Willian, Salah, Oscar.  We are golden here and can bring back Piazon if needed.

Striker -  um....Lukaku maybe Schurrle

GK - yep.....Cech/Courtois......embarrassment of riches

At minimum we need a first choice striker and a LB/RB depending on how you view Azpi at this point.  A long term partner for Azpi would be good and using a few English spots wouldn't be the worst

Shaw and Costa should be wrapped up before the world cup.  A new midfielder would be great and if we can pry barkley away from Everton it would help with the English spots.   I think one more striker could come in to be our number two especially if we ship out Lukaku for some stupid reason.

&gt;NI pays for pensions 

It's all from the same pot. Unless the scheme is specifically funded then it just comes out of the pot. 

The best part is even though all the funding comes from one point, the government keeps all of the funds separate on paper to give their mates in the pension industry a massive backhander. Pension reform to be more like Canada / The Netherlands has been brought up many times and it gets struck down because Parliament is too close to the City. The savings would be in the tens of billions per year.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-moving-forward-with-pension-fund-consolidation

£508 million per annum, over 20+ years of the average retirement age, tens of billions to be saved...

There are still about £1.7 *trillion* in unfunded pensions liabilities that the government refuses to even talk about. It's a can that keeps getting kicked down the road.

My GF managed most of the selling of old stuff that we couldn't/didn't want to carry, and the boxing, but that still took a lot of my own time. The move itself took about as long as expected, and fortunately I was able to ensure net access on arrival but it's important to remember that the Spanish postal service is, well, less efficient than that of the UK. If you post stuff off regularly make sure you live close to a post office :) Fortunately, I don't need to, but getting a PO box was a must for me all the same.

To pretend that the Ukraine was some how a stalwart ally of Russia that has been co-opted by the EU or nato is patently ridiculous.

The fact of the matter are that Russia put huge economic pressure on the Ukraine over the EU association agreement which lead to Yanukovych (who up to this point had been pushing to achieve the political reforms that the EU had required ) reversing the deal for one with Russia. The people demonstrated, Yanukovych fled from the capital, was unanimously impeached and an interim government set up. 

This has lead to Russia ignoring the democratic will of the Ukraine people (based on a technicality about his impeachment which largely ignores that Yanukovych had control of the Judiciary etc) pretending that Yanukovych is legitimate so they can use it an excuse to ignore the new government while happily accepting Crimea's vote on independence which technically wasn't legal either.

Worth noting that the vote that was, literally, just between ""I want crimean to be a total independent part of Ukraine"" and ""I want to be part of Russia"" with no way to vote as status quo and the former granting the powers that would allow them to do the latter anyway. 

In short Russia wanted the Ukraine to remain firmly under their control and it blew up in their faces and now they are using it as an excuse to make a land grab. I'm not going to say the west is blameless in all this, there has undoubtedly been an interest in an EU aligned Ukraine but to pretend that this mess is the result of that and not Russia's own failed attempts to keep Ukraine inline with Russia is really very... well... silly. 

I agree that there was no way this was going to start a war, Russia never would have done this is they didn't think they'd just basically get away with it but this whole thing has been driven by Russia intervention and is *about* Russia's ability to retain influence where they think they should have influence after the Ukraine had told them to go fuck themselves.

Where though? Their only other Mediterranean port is in Syria and NATO is doing it's best to knock out that one as well. That would leave Russia with a huge detour through Scandinavia to be able to ship anything via the North Sea or Med. The northern passage is very exposed &amp; dangerous in times of war and has issues in the winter due to ice, plus once you get out of the worst part you still have to get past either the ""GIUK gap"" or English Channel which NATO monitors so closely it probably knows if a bird shits in the water!

We're playing a dangerous game, cornered animals tend to strike out and Russia is a gnats hair away from that situation.

&gt; Nothing wrong with having international observers or even UN making sure that the vote in Crimea is legal et al.

IIRC that was offered but the UN said no to avoid lending legitimacy to the vote. 

&gt;  If Ukraine wanted closer ties with the EU, they would know that treating people in discriminatory fashion wouldn't be a good sign for the EU.

Therein lies the hypocrisy in our stance; the many of the new leaders of Ukraine are outright fascists who seek nothing other than being discriminataory. They've already removed Russian as an ""official lanaguage"" of the country, so things like government websites, forms, documents etc etc will ostracise about 33% (IIRC) of the remaining population.

&gt; I'm not aware of this. If this real or speculation?

[It's beginning to look iffy at the very least](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/219brz/us_other_powers_kick_russia_out_of_g8/cgb0fws). Lots of cash and PR has been poured in their direction by the usual suspects, particularly Larry Diamond who was behind the ""I am Ukranian"" viral video that triggered it all off. There's talk of $5 billion being spent on the 'development of democracy' in Ukraine. Most of these groups were also involved in the 2004 elections following the original revolution they had. 

It even seems apparent that [the snipers that provoked the escalation](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2573923/Estonian-Foreign-Ministry-confirms-authenticity-leaked-phone-call-discussing-Kiev-snipers-shot-protesters-possibly-hired-Ukraines-new-leaders.html) were under the orders of the new leaders. 

&gt; It's certainly better than not being in it, especially when a small country with fragile everything and shortly after revolution, is overtaken by Russia's forces.

Swings and roundabouts. NATO membership isn't just a military pact, it's a way of life! You need to embrace the IMF which means forced rules on ""austerity"", privatisation etc etc  via onerous loans that bankrupt your country for generations while lining the pocket of whichever corrupt government steps up. We aren't doing this for the benefit of Ukraine, we'll bleed them dry. The EU trade agreement had that in mind; in removing trade tariffs from Europe their own industry would not be able to compete with the more developed parts of EU industry. We're playing real dirty here, offering them a shitty trade deal then overthrowing the government when it gets rejected.

How are they getting the brunt of it? and the answer I guess is practicality. If you take much more money from the top than we already are we actually stop making as much money as a country, and the end result is even less capacity to provide welfare and healthcare.

Here is some quick thinking pull out of my ass answers.

The first thing you have to realize is each time travel ability comes with it's own set of micro rules.  The only constant rule among all time travel abilities is that all changes take place in one universe.

Point 1. Any time travel with Curtis' abilities allow him to maintain the memories from both timelines.  Because he maintains both memories, he has feelings for Alisha.  Spending double the time with her means double the feelings.  Clearly he was cheating on Sam.

Point 2. In Misfits, time travel doesnt create a parallel universe, it alters the singular one.  Because of this, if an object travels to the past it will continue on in time and essentially coexist until the time the original travels back to the past.  Example.  You travel back to two weeks before your birth.  Once you are born there will be two of you in the world until you travel back in time or until the older you travels back to the future.  

Curtis is also selfish and narcissistic. Maybe he had a dvd or flashdrive with the interviews with him when he traveled to the past to stop the milk man.  He showed the gang, simon asked for a copy, simon put it on a vhs because he is a hipster.

Point 3.  This isnt a big deal.  They clearly shot the scene but had to cut it for time.  Its like Arrested Development and their ""on the next. . ."" scenes that are never in the next episode.

Point 4.  With Curtis' ability, now Kelly's ability, they keep the memories from all timelines they enter.  Her remembering her nazi life and her normal life is still possible.

Point 5.  Simon traveled to the point he traveled to because he needed to save Nathan from the cult so he (nathan)could kill Rachel.  If she(rachel) lived Alisha, and everyone else, would never have returned to normal.

Point 6.  I cant solve this one. the guy cant time travel but has the ability to send a person's mind back and forth through time.  Thats why Jess had the baby but no memory of it.  Her body was basically on autopilot.

When she tried to kill herself, the guy sent her mind back in time but I get lost there.  I cant explain why the message would be on the phone.

One theory is he sends the person and anything that are on their person through time.  That would explain the message on the phone because the phone containing the video was from the future but if that was the case, she would have slit wrists.  It also wouldn't explain the baby.  If Jess' body was sent to the future, she would have just been pregnant one year in the future, instead of already having birthed a child.",0,1396269946,null,0,false,0,cggduui,t3_20hfaj,t1_cggduui,t1_cg7xnz6,null,1433145804,1,false,misfitstv,t5_2s8pg,1

Step 1: Befriend lots of MPs with similar views to you. Convince them that state provisioning is wasteful and unfair to the super efficient private sector. Get them to support funding cuts.

Step 2: Rent a thinktank to write a report on how badly the newly cut services are doing. Suggest that your private company gets the contracts (Note: Only take the ones which are immediately profitable). The MPs you befriended think this is a vote-winning idea and agree.

Step 3: Offer non-executive / consultancy positions to your befriended MPs, take them out to dinner on occasion. Profit massively and don't reinvest.

Looking at the term it's hard to say what it is exactly, as some policies Farage wants to have don't really work with it. Let's take smoking, Farage's libertarianism says the ban shouldn't be introduced, as all people are individuals  and should do whatever they want, but on the other hand he fails to see that smoking may harm other. That's just contradiction.

&gt;from centralised bureaucracies like the EU

And putting that power back to the UK's government, when it doesn't change much anyway as it is still someone above us who decides things. While on the other hand, why is it bad to discuss issues internationally? After all we can achieve more as a group, rather than individuals (proven on plenty of occasions).

&gt;but the EU does a lot of harm to unskilled workers

Nothing wrong with changing the EU, even if it's very hard to do so. The ""harm"" is also usually exaggerated and not proven by research. Also, I've heard ""mass non-skilled immigration"" and ""mass skilled immigration"" and anti-immigrant people/organisations use one of these whenever it suits their current topic.

&gt;Many people want a referendum and a democratic choice in their lives and some see UKIP as the only way for them to get that.

Fair point. Nothing wrong with having a referendum, especially when majority support it. Democracy works in a way though, that we elect politicians who say what they want to do. Ideally if they win they should put it into motion. If we have Cameron who says he will give referendum and yet there is also UKIP who says the same, then obviously splitting votes doesn't help. Ukip supporters should switch to Conservatives, at least that's my opinion. If Labour wins and they have said they will NOT give referendum, than tough luck, make campaigns before next elections to pick up the party which says will give referendum.

&gt;

&gt;__Ashdown Forest__ is an ancient area of tranquil open heathland occupying the highest sandy ridge-top of the [High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Weald_AONB). It is situated some 30 miles (48 km) south of London in the county of [East Sussex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Sussex), England. Rising to an altitude of 223 metres (732 ft) above sea level, its heights provide expansive vistas across the heavily wooded hills of the [Weald](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weald) to the chalk escarpments of the [North Downs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Downs) and [South Downs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Downs) on the horizon.

&gt;Ashdown Forest's origins lie as a medieval hunting forest created soon after the [Norman conquest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_conquest) of England. By 1283 the forest was fenced in by a 23 miles (37 km) *pale* enclosing an area of some 20 square miles (5,200 ha). 34 *gates* and *hatches* in the pale, still remembered in place names such as Chuck Hatch and Chelwood Gate, allowed local people to enter to graze their livestock, collect firewood and cut heather and bracken for animal bedding. The Forest continued to be used by the monarchy and nobility for hunting into Tudor times, including notably [Henry VIII](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VIII), who had a hunting lodge at [Bolebroke Castle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolebroke_Castle), [Hartfield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartfield) and who courted [Anne Boleyn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Boleyn) at nearby [Hever Castle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hever_Castle).

&gt;Ashdown Forest has a rich archaeological heritage. It contains much evidence of prehistoric human activity, with the earliest evidence of human occupation dating back to 50,000 years ago. There are important Bronze Age, Iron Age and Romano-British remains.

I watched as a group of twenty somethings strolled onto the platform, opened a bottle of cider and sat on the floor. A few minutes later, an old man walked up to them and joined them. Soon there were about 10 people sat on the platform, passing bottles of cider up and down the line.

After the alcohol started to take effect (the train was sat for around 20 mins), the cider line started to get bored. Obviously offended by the existence of the train, they started throwing bottle lids and other small crap the the windows, laughing gleefully as myself and the other passengers jumped at the impacts. For a finale, one of the rather merry ""men"" stood up, walked over to the train, made eye contact with a female passenger and pissed up the side of the train.

Clearly having had enough, the conductor closed the doors and signalled the driver to go. Not a single fuck was given by the train crew.

I don't believe they should be punished. More that the other options can only come about at the cost of road space - which results in punishing car drivers.

totally - But I would argue people should use the right tools for the job. Need to do your weekly shop, use your car. Need to go 2-3-5-10 miles down the road, bus, cycle or park and ride. If the infrastructure not there demand it, if that does not work we will continue on the path we currently are.

Atos and the sick/disabled - thousands of people are too ill and clearly cannot work are being found fit for work (they found a woman who was in coma fit for work) Sick people have died because of the stress being caused and it's the goverments fault because they are the ones that brought in completely draconian measures to access people on. Don't even bring labour into because they weren't so vile and inhuman! All the gov cares about is hitting targets so they can then spin to the pathetic public.

""Bedroom tax"" - now if this was inmplented properly then it would of been a good idea but it's not. Nowhere enough 1/2 bedroom places which gov knew about so  people in bigger houses are getting shafted (especially the sick) I know some money was put aside to help disabled but i've not heard anything since so i'm skeptical. Don't you even dare tell me people should move because they shouldn't have to move away from family and possibly to a place with worse job prospects. 

Zero hour contracts - huge rise on then since tories came into power.

Workfare - 30 hours a week for benefits? No! Companies exploit and will keep using them instead of actually hiring anyone.

I think it would be a good idea to get people on some voluantry work because at least with that they're helping charitys and local community (and not big corporations who use and treat you like crap) Plus gets them experience which can only help.

Not sure why you picked on my innocuous post, which has not much to do with the legality of parking, being as it is a call towards legalizing criminal damage.

Farage is implying that Putin is a stronger and better global leader than anyone in the UK or the rest of Europe. He gets things done, as opposed to what he sees as the bloated and inefficient EU. 

The fact that you have gone as far as South Korea to find a politician that you admire shows how effective that line of attack has the potential to be. If you can convince people that Putin of all people is a better leader than anyone in the EU, you just might get them on your side, as an anti-europe party.

 He might not be able to convince you, but what about the people who vote Ukip or are thinking of voting for them? A leader who puts his own nation first, who looks out for national interests and doesn't do what he is told by the international community.

Every year, when they see the Morris dancers, the son asks his dad if he can join them. 'Not until you're eighteen, son,' Dad always says, hoping the boy will forget about it. But he doesn't.

On his eighteenth birthday, the son opens his presents and cards, goes out for a meal with his family, and generally has a jolly old time. But something is missing; something isn't quite right.

'What's the matter, son?' Dad asks, starting to worry. 

'I'm eighteen now, Dad,' the son replies. 'I want to be a Morris dancer.'

The dad realises that there's nothing he can say or do to avoid it. The time has come for his son to take up the bells and handkerchiefs of the ancient tradition of Morris dancing. So the next day, he drives his only child down to the local Morris dancers' HQ.

'I want to become a Morris dancer,' the young man says to the chief dancer, a grizzled old man with grey hair and a thick Gloucestershire accent. 

'How old are you?' he asks, frowning. It's not often someone still with all their own teeth wants to join the Morris dancers. 

'Eighteen,' the boy replies eagerly. 'I am old enough, aren't I?' He would be devastated if he were turned down after all this. 

The old man nods slowly. 'Arr,' he grunts. 'You're old enough. But first you'll have to pass a medical exam. You've got to be fit to be a Morris dancer.'

As luck would have it, the Morris dancers' doctor happens to be at HQ at the time, so he takes the boy into a side room for an on-the-spot checkup. He's in fairly good shape, perhaps a little on the chubby side but a few turns of Brighton Camp or Hunting the Squirrel would soon sort that out. Finally, as the checkup is almost over, the good doctor says, 'Pull down your trousers'.

'What?' the boy asks, sure he's misheard. 

'Pull down your trousers,' the doctor repeats.

'Why!?' The poor kid is mortified. 

'Look,' replies the doctor, 'do you want to be a Morris dancer or don't you? Come on, let's get it over with.'

Red-faced and ashamed, but determined to become a Morris dancer, the boy undoes his belt and pulls down his jeans.

'And your pants,' sighs the doctor, so the boy pulls them down as well.

A quick prod and poke is all that's needed. 'I'm sorry,' says the doctor, gesturing at the boy's penis, 'but there simply isn't a place for you here with the Morris dancers. You've been circumcised.'

'What's wrong with that?' the boy asks, his pulse quickening. Hot tears are prickling the backs of his eyes and he blinks them back furiously.

'Sorry,' the doctor repeats, and he appears to genuinely means it, 'but only a complete prick can become a Morris dancer.'

To find a *political leader*,  not politician.

On one hand, Agger has done nothing wrong to lose his spot in the team right now and the ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" adage comes to mind. He has played ok lately, not bad, not great.

On the other hand, I'm of the mindset that Sakho is the better player and is the future going forward so we need to start utilizing his talents. For the upcoming match, I definitely think he is better equipped to handle the likes of Carroll. From a financial standpoint, we didn't pay 17m for a player to sit on the bench.

We don't want to mess with a winning formula, but at the same time, we have a player on the bench who is most likely the better option. It is a really difficult decision to make, and I don't envy the position Rodgers is in, but I'm pretty sure we will see Agger in the starting lineup come Sunday whether we agree with it or not.

The UK sold chemicals used to make many of the chemical weapons in Syria. Nobody is innocent in that conflict.

I despise Putin, i think he is one of the biggest threats to international security in the world today. But I have to admire how he had been doing things recently. He prevented an invasion of Syria, which may have ended the conflict there, to protect his own interests, but he did it in a way that made him seem like the peacemaker in the region.

Then, he annexed an entire region of Ukraine without killing anyone (One person has been killed since), while the rest of the world sat by and did NOTHING.

yeah thats a single thing that went wrong, but how were the government to know the company contracted would turn out to be incompetent? besides that the intention was efficiency to make sure the welfare money was being spent efficiently.

I dare, they fucking should if they want to choose where to live they can pay for it themselves. Their convenience is fucking other equally deserving people out of a place to live. By the way less free money is not a tax, just throwing it out there.

The difference being that before these contracts the people now on them were unemployed.

Hence now I think the way to tackle this issue is to rather overhaul local government and try make this more accountable and efficient. So basically lets try to make local councils more useful. Sounds over simplified and it'll probably never work but not doing anything to solve this problem is a huge mistake.

One way would be to group these local councils into regional areas (e.g. all the councils in each region of around 8 million people would form a sort of regional-provincial-state government for that larger area). These regional governments would then be answerable to the National Government of the UK. In my mind this is similar to federalization but somewhat different.

With the way things are going, I then thought of perhaps a Federation of European states that would go along with this recent wave of regional independence to go over Europe. However I note that a lot of the news about regional independence in Europe (i.e. the latest news about Venice wanting to be independent) is rather blown out of proportion. Plus it means more EU federalization and power, which I know a lot of people wouldn't want.

What really got to me was comparing the two managers pre-match chats. The interviewer asked Tim what he felt after re-watching the previous Spurs/Liverpool match and Tim said he didn't bother to look at it, instead he was hoping to weather the storm and strike later in the match (a tactic that had me scratching my head considering Liverpool are the hardest team in the league to try simply hold out against, and he opted for Siggurdson in a deep midfield position). 

Rogers on the other hand instantly pointed out how he saw spurs high line as a weakness and looked to penetrate it (exactly what happened). 

I kept asking myself yesterday what was the plan, I would watch the players off the ball to see where/why they were moving and short of some decent link up play through the middle there didn't appear to be anything. Villa caused Liverpool all kinds of issues some time back by leaning on Gerrard all game, I saw Eriksen take Gerrard on once (successfully), apart from that we appeared to attack them where they were strongest.

I try to find the positives in spurs as often as possible but yesterday there was no plan, no passion and no sign of growth. Eriksen is a lone bright spark currently.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"Yesterday was a great example of what a good manager can do for a team.

Tim may espouse that passion is pivotal in winning games, that the approach has to be ""blood and thunder"", and passion and determination are great but you have to also back it up with some management.

I can't even say he seems to be learning from mistakes at this point. He is literally making the same mistake as AVB did with playing the high line (with a defensive back line not ideally suited to it) and not effectively pressing from the midfield.

He continually insists on playing Eriksen and Chadi out of position and opted to play with no DM against the best attack in the league yesterday.  He doesn't seem to be putting the players in the best position to succeed.

The pressing being done on the pitch by both teams was a good example of management. When we pressed it was usually 1 or 2 players moving up to press, when the LFC player faced the press they were able to find a teammate without pressure to get the ball to and then moved to provide the teammate with a outlet for when he was pressed. It was easily solved by the LFC squad and they were able to consistently exploit the lack of consistent pressure paired with the high line.  

When LFC pressed the entire unit pressed, they knew where their teamates were and effectively switched ensuring that our players were all constantly under pressure and we had no clue how to cope with it. The result was errant passes and lost possession or long balls down field. Over and Over again.

At half time you would have expected a change in how we were doing things yet we stayed the course.

Yes we made mistakes that contributed to the goals, but honestly with how that game was approached by the two managers, even without the mistakes it would have only been a matter of time before LFC lit us up.

This approach isn't unique to TT, certainly Cleanfeed (BTs system) works in a similar way. The only way to block individual files on a web server is by proxying or running some kind of DPI on the traffic - otherwise, how is the ISP going to know what files you are accessing?

He looks like a seasoned professional now with his decision making, and he's a threat all over the field with and without the ball. And while earlier in the season he almost always tried to beat defenders with pace he is now confident enough to slow down and get his head up and play more intelligently because he's confident that when challenged physically he can hold defenders off the ball. I think the way he stretches the field wide and is able to hold onto possession is the most important improvement we've made that makes us capable of beating any team.

&gt;

&gt;__Merseyside__ /ˈmɜrzisaɪd/ (Br.: [*clarification needed*] /ˈmɜ:zisaɪd/) is a [metropolitan county](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_county) in [North West England](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_England), with a population of [1.38 million](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ceremonial_counties_of_England).  It encompasses the [metropolitan area](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_area) centred on both banks of the lower reaches of the [Mersey Estuary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersey_Estuary), and comprises five [metropolitan boroughs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_borough): [Knowsley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Borough_of_Knowsley), [St Helens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Borough_of_St_Helens), [Sefton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Borough_of_Sefton), [Wirral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Borough_of_Wirral), and the city of [Liverpool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool). Merseyside, which was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the [Local Government Act 1972](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government_Act_1972), takes its name from the [River Mersey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Mersey).

&gt;Merseyside spans 249 square miles (645 km^2) of land which border [Lancashire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire) (to the north-east), [Greater Manchester](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Manchester) (to the east), and [Cheshire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheshire) (to the south and south-west); the [Irish Sea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Sea) is to the west. [North Wales](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Wales) is across the [Dee Estuary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dee_Estuary). There is a mix of high density urban areas, suburbs, semi-rural and rural locations in Merseyside, but overwhelmingly the land use is urban. It has a focused central business district, formed by [Liverpool City Centre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_City_Centre), but Merseyside is also a polycentric county with five metropolitan districts, each of which has at least one major town centre and outlying suburbs. The [Liverpool Urban Area](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_Urban_Area) is the [fifth most populous conurbation in England](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_conurbations_in_the_United_Kingdom), and dominates the geographic centre of the county, while the smaller [Birkenhead Urban Area](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birkenhead_Urban_Area) dominates the [Wirral Peninsula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirral_Peninsula) in the south.

&gt;For the 12 years following 1974 the county had a two-tier system of local government; district councils shared power with the [Merseyside County Council](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_County_Council). The county council was abolished in 1986, and so its districts (the metropolitan boroughs) are now effectively [unitary authority areas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_authorities_of_England). However, the metropolitan county continues to exist in law and as a geographic frame of reference,  and several county-wide services are co-ordinated by authorities and joint-boards, such as [Merseytravel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Passenger_Transport_Executive) (for public transport), [Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Fire_and_Rescue_Service) and the [Merseyside Police](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police) (for law-enforcement); as a [ceremonial county](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceremonial_counties_of_England), Merseyside has a [Lord Lieutenant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Lieutenant_of_Merseyside) and a [High Sheriff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Sheriff_of_Merseyside). Merseyside is joined by the neighbouring borough of [Halton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halton_(borough\)) to form the [Liverpool City Region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_City_Region), which utilises The Mersey Partnership as a development agency.

&gt;Merseyside is an [amalgamation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalgamation_(politics\)) of 22 former local government districts from the [former administrative counties](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_counties_of_England) of [Lancashire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire), [Cheshire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheshire) and six autonomous [county boroughs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_borough) centred on [Birkenhead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birkenhead), [Bootle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootle), Liverpool, [Southport](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport), [St Helens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Helens,_Merseyside), and [Wallasey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallasey).

Should we actually persist at around replacement fertility, it's perhaps less of a pressing issue to reform *ceteris paribus*). Also we had never we seen quite such dramatic increase in old-age life expectancy, which is the other pressure on pensions systems. 

I'm not arguing that some policies couldn't have been done better (obviously there is a fair bit of politicking around the state pension), but in all honesty it's difficult to design such a policy with fairly vague projections and guarantee it's going to fall out perfectly.

What? I am trying to look at options for solving the problem, you are refusing to participate and instead you are lashing out at me for whatever reason.

&gt;  There was no problem. The problem is the government changing the fees against the majority of people's will.

Exactly, I am giving a solution for how to get it back to the way it was, you seem to just want to cry about it without actually solving anything.

&gt; And I am currently enjoying £0 tuition fees. Funny how I still fight for those who have to pay, despite being fortunate enough not to have to pay.

I never went to University so I don't have fees either, but I would still like to see the price lowered (actually, I think it should be free, but I suppose it has to be paid for somehow) so that everyone had the same opportunity. It won't be lowered if all we do is moan about how unfair it is, which is what you are doing (moaning about it is not ""fighting"" for it, it's not really doing anything other than showing your displeasure). The only way to change it is by voting for someone other than the conservatives, or at least someone who doesn't plan on financially draining the country's workforce before they even get a job.

""Dear *amfxc*,
 
We currently block URLs recommended by the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) that contain child abuse imagery. Due to the way we block these links, we are aware that some users may experience intermittent issues accessing some hosting sites for the days when a sub-URL, or content that is being hosted on that site, has been placed on the IWF list.  We know that recently some customers had issues for a few days when trying to access Wordpress for this reason. This issue only happens for the duration that the URL is being blocked and most hosting sites are extremely responsive in taking down the offensive content once it has been identified. We know this is very inconvenient for customers affected and we are working on an improvement to how we block the IWF list that is intended to stop this happening in the future. We hope this will launch very soon and we will keep you updated with news.

 
Kind Regards
 

Michael"" 

I'm still talking to him now and will update when any more relevant information is available. 

**EDIT:** Funnily enough I've just received an email from the IWF which **completely contradicts** what Michael Hopkins said. The message is:

""IWF does not itself block websites but does provide a list of URLs for Internet companies and organisations to facilitate URL blocking (not IP address or domain level blocking)...With regards to imgur we do action specific URLs from time to time but it is never at the domain level and there is no reason why you should not be able to access legitimate parts of the website.

We were showing systemic weaknesses but the score could have easily ended 1-2 or even 2-2 with a little tightening on defense and better finishing. Sherwood didnt see it as a systemic mismatch, and once the game started he realized that his game plan would probably go fine if we had a little luck on our side. Which is retarded of course, but he didnt set us up for failure from the get go, he just overestimated the mental intangibles from our team. With a little more passion and focus the difference would have been huge. I wish we played with 5 in the back, but Sherwood thought a result against liverpool would be a high scoring 3-4 or 4-4 affair. He set us up to combat liverpool with speed and finesse in the midfield rather than a solid rock in the back. Maybe that's partially because he knew that our team would make mistakes, but coming back from a goal or 2 down is a lot easier without 5 defenders.

Since the age of 8 I've had all teachers say to me or my mum on parents evening that I write like a doctor (I.E. A fucking mess). I've actually resorted to getting people with neat handwriting to write my application for me as I recite it to them. If I have to write an application I will write it in block caps because I can barely read my own writing so I don't expect others to be able to. Spelling is one I can agree with however, really shows a lot about people.

2. is kind of fair, a crease or a slightly raised up corner should not be a problem IMO, sometimes people have to fill in forms on a small desk (Like me) and usually there are a bunch of forms on the desk so some are going to get slightly creased.

3. I feel you're wrong on this one, I'm 17 and under recently I was attending college. I dropped out after only getting a pass last year and having to do the same course again to get a merit would kill me, that course is depressing. I left school with only one GCSE and that was in Maths. I'm not stupid, I only have one GCSE because I was bullied at school and just couldn't handle it so I withdrew from school. Maybe I'm in a minority but usually there is a reason for this.

If an application form comes in with bad spelling, looks a mess and they have shit grades then of course that is fair, however you should not rule out every candidate because of their grades.

we have migrants up here that have fit in perfectly well and those that have fit in less well, along with natives i'd love to deport on the flimsiest pretence.

The three key things that would get to the route of the problem. 
1. Sort out the chronic housing shortage, we need to build enough to at a bare minimum track population growth. this would stop people being driven out and areas getting overloaded.
2. Stop building ""rich"" and ""poor"" areas social housing needs to be interspersed with private housing with short and long term rental.
3. This all needs to happen more slowly, if an area changed over 50 years that's fair enough it gets objectionable when i happens in less than 10. Not sure exactly how to go about that i must admit, longer term rental tenancies would be a start. as would addressing the first point and building more.

People work their whole lives to pay off their mortgage should understand that - it's not like it's a secret. When undertaking such a huge debt, it's pretty stupid not to inform yourself. However, I think people do generally understand and still take out mortgages because the net gain is positive for them.

You have to view lending as a service, people borrow money for important things - cars, houses, starting businesses, etc. It serves a role in the economy and in making people happier and more mobile. If banks/building societies could only lend out up to the amount they hold in deposits then loans would be more expensive and a lot harder to obtain.

true,cacafogo,num5,,"There are only two things I question about the Liverpool game.  It isn't the lack of a DM, because as I wrote before the game I doubt it would have helped us (and I still maintain that position).  It isn't playing Eriksen on the wing and Chadli in the center, because I see reasons for that too.  It isn't starting Bentaleb every game (in fact in this game it was actually a good idea).  I will happily explain to anyone why I don't question the above decisions.

The first question is why he didn't have everyone putting some actual pressure on the ball instead of sitting back and letting them do whatever with it.  Maybe the players aren't motivated enough, maybe he told them to sit back, who knows, but it has been a common issue while we are still using a high line.  Against Liverpool in particular that is incredibly stupid, you need to take away their time on the ball so they can't thread it through the defense, and we didn't do that.  That shows a complete lack of tactical knowledge, an unwillingness to change, or the inability to motivate the squad, any of which is a big problem for a manager.

The second question is why the fuck Sherwood was in the stands the past few games.  I don't know what message he is trying to send, but the message we are getting is that he doesn't give a shit.  He isn't getting paid just for his time during the week.  If the squad has motivation issues, it certainly isn't inspiring to see your manager (or rather, not see him) up in the stands texting his assistant.  He says passion is important, and he certainly is passionate when he's on the touchline, but then goes and hangs out away from everyone.  I saw a lot of people asking ""why was he still in the stands after going 2 goals down"" but I think the better question is ""why was he there in the first place"".  Managers should only be in the stands when they get a touchline ban, simple as that.  They need to lead and organize the team, and they cannot do that from the stands.

I agree to an extent that you don't want a bunch of idiots working for you with money - but make sure you reward clever people intellectually some how. Having worked in retail often it was the case that I would be talked down to about issues or topics that I knew more about or grasped more clearly than superiors. They were a manager because of age, not necessarily merit. 

 Now, I'm not saying I'm that intelligent, but if it's an environment where there's no stimulation then they'll get bored and just start to work the system and it can back fire on you. Basically, treat them like intelligent people.

Secondly a child has a right to not be denied education, and the right to freedom of expression, religion and conscience.

Additionally the state has the legislative obligation to, while taking the least intrusive steps, treat the welfare of children as a paramount consideration (while also taking the childs views into account)

It's easy to see how these three things can come into conflict.

In saying that, I think it is easy to argue that the best interests of a child are served by not allowing educational institutions to fail to teach basic established scientific reality. If a family wishes to teach their children otherwise privately they can, and likewise a child can choose to ignore whatever they are taught. The state has that obligation to ensure their ""best interests"" are served at school, I suppose.

So, the balance of cover on the policy will reduce in line with an equivalent repayment mortgage with the same interest rate as already illustrated by GavChap.

Your situation sounds a little complex so you may want to take some advice. If you demand a higher sum assured now, reducing in the future, but not so linear as with a decreasing term plan you could, in theory, set up a series of level term policies with different terms and gradually reducing cover e.g.

* 10 year policy £50,000
* 9 year policy £40,000
* 8 year policy £30,000
* 7 year policy £20,000

So cover in years 1-7 = £140,000
Year 8 = £120,000
Year 9 = £90,000
Year 10 = £50,000
End of year 10 = £0

Slightly more expensive and administratively onerous, but might fulfill a need.

Yes.

&gt; The only way to significantly cut down on car use would be to drain the life out of all the smaller towns and villages, and squeeze absolutely everyone in the UK into that area within the M25. Or at least into the centres of half a dozen big cities.

Bullshit would it.

Look at the Netherlands. They have more cars per head of population than us, but they manage to keep their towns and cities free of parked cars on the pavement and too much motor vehicle traffic.

&gt; Build super-high-rise skyscrapers, keep all business and people in a tiny area, and then the need to travel is vastly reduced... But is that really a world that any non-Londoner would want to live in?

I'm not *assuming* the grades over the population are good. I'm *stating* that over the population of school leavers as a whole, the grades are better than they've ever been, and *much* better than they were a decade or two ago. That's a statement of fact, and the Guardian link gives the actual government statistics if you want to check. If the applicants for your job don't have good grades, that's likely a problem relating to the conditions or prospects of the job you're offering, and not a problem with the output of the school system. (If the complaint was that the kids with good grades were terrible that might be the problem, but that's not the case here)

&gt;The well educated ones will go where the opportunities are for them - University or a decent job in a major city. The small-medium chain of value stores will attract 'everyone else', not the ones who are working towards something.

Mortgages are the key one but also any sort of personal loan. Also, many businesses have loans to invest in further expansion. 

This all comes from the ability to loan out depositors' money multiple times.

&gt; 2) what are the greens going to replace this system with?

I'm guessing that the Greens would replace it with them only being able to loan out money collected through investors purchasing bonds. That would make it very, very difficult to get a loan because there simply wouldn't be enough investors to cover the amount of loans issued for normal economic activity.

&gt; Having looked up the definition of FRB it seems this must be the way most retail banks make money, no? So how on earth would they continue to exist without this system?

Correct, retail banks would be pretty screwed if they couldn't loan out customers' money. They'd have to radically alter their business models.

&gt;  So how on earth would they continue to exist without this system?

true,ckwop,null,null,"&gt; Ending private banks ability to create money out of thin air, then lend it to people at interest would 'trigger a serious depression'?

Yes, it would. The ability to loan out depositors' money is central to economic expansion. All the loans to businesses, mortgages, personal loans etc all depend on this principle. 

I find this line often touted on the internet of creating money ""out of thin air"" hilarious. What, pray tell, do you think money actually is? Knowing the answer to that question is the start of economic literacy. 

The purpose of money is to facilitate _trade_. Banks creating money fulfils this purpose.

&gt; The people that enable the banks to perpetuate debt and devalue the currency on a daily basis are the ones which should be kept away from power. How anyone can think that giving banks the ability to create magic money is a good thing is beyond me.

Inflation is a central part of any sensible monetary policy. Money is there to be _spent_. You can't have money that behaves like an asset or a commodity. 

For example, if the pound was appreciating at a rate of 5% a year, nobody would spend their pounds. They could just hold on to them and they'd make a five percent return. This would cause a huge drop in trade, resulting in a depression.

Money is designed to lose its value so that people invest it or spend it, creating economic activity. That's its purpose in the world.

Assuming you earn over the personal allowance in on your main job the second job would be taxed at 20% on all of it. As you say you're only just getting by I'll ignore the complications of 40% tax!

You do better on NI though. Your free-pay (the threshold before paying NI) is per-job, so if you earn less than ~~£700 or whatever it is~~ £153 per week or £805 per month in your second job you won't pay any NI on it.

And look at videos of Dawson's yellow cards- a majority of them were as a result of his brave/foolhardy runs forward. CBs dart forward on occasion- picking a CB with a speed handicap over one without one simply for tactics' sake isn't solving the problem- it is creating one. I genuinely believe that both Vert and Chiriches are fast enough to catch up to Suarez after Dawson's bad pass yesterday to Kaboul. A CB uses his physical skills to complement his role in the central defense. You don't hear anyone saying Kaboul/Dawson is a poor pairing because they are both tall. Physical talent like jumping, dribbling, and speed shouldn't be seen as a handicap but rather an asset. So I guess my point is why are we holding Chiriches skill on the ball and speed against him?

Levy has created a structure that allows for football clubs to thrive. We have our brand growing across emerging markets. We now have one of the best training grounds on the planet. Our youth program is improving and is producing some quality talent. The stadium is on it's way which I feel some people don't realize how difficult it is to build a stadium in London. Levy also has a lot of other people funding this stadium around the idea of enhancing the city of Tottenham, thus reducing the investment the club has to pay. 

Levy needs to just get one more thing right. He needs to know who to hire and when to fire. Which he has done incorrectly a few times. Jol, Ramos, Avb. Arry was right to be sacked. In the past it has been difficult for spurs to sign a world class manager, which is the reason why we have to bring in young and less proven managers because in the past Spurs was a much less attractive club to manage. 

What levy has now done is created this foundation that will enable a world class manager to thrive in the long term. And finally if rumors have any truth we might just be getting that manager this summer. 

IMO the biggest difference between Spurs and the top 4 teams is they have a proven world class manager. Yes we don't have a Suarez or a hazard but if you look at the individual quality our club  it's right up there with the best in the league. 

Also like the post made a few weeks ago spurs are at a massive financial disadvantage to the other teams in the league.

They do. I remember writing a CV in class when I was 15.

The hardest part about writing a CV though is not the formatting or the layout, it is the content. It's no good being taught how to put together a CV if we've got nothing to put on it. Unless you were lucky enough to have a paper round, employment history was empty, and the qualifications section only had our Key Stage 2 SATs on it as we hadn't done our GCSEs yet, which left a list of skills and hobbies alongside a short personal statement. At 15 years old you're not going to have many skills, and even if you do it's going to be an arbitrary list because you likely have little or no experiences to show how you demonstrated those skills. So what you end up with is a list of hobbies (e.g. I like socialising, listening to music, playing FIFA and walking my dog), and a list of skills comprising of the following: Communication skills, IT Skills and Numeracy Skills.

Only offers a useful option in a system where we expect to be pinned down in our own half. Lampard is getting old and far less reliable and also still looks to get forward rather than willing to sit. MvG is practically our only hope. Unless Romeu plays for us again, I kinda wish he would but I haven't been paying too much attention to his loan.

At the end of the day LEVY has hired every manager since ENIC took over and they have all been fired by him too. That should make it crystal clear to him that he needs to step back and give the next guy time and control regardless of early results or expectations....

Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't trade him for any other chairman, I just feel he really needs to believe in the next guy and the philosophy he brings, he's created the foundation, he just needs to step back now, interfere again and it won't matter if the next manager is world class or not, it will fail again!!!

1. The WHOLE Kop stood up and sang for the WHOLE game.

2. The songs! Done 25 home matches in the last three years and 8 this year, and a lot of the songs on Sunday have rarely been sung. They are mainly all the old Glory songs. Even a tribute to the ghost goal, with the Luis Garcia song.

http://youtu.be/-iEnyf2JL5M

3. My pal jumped too high on the Suarez goal and fell a row and a half. This was common place yesterday. It's was a fucking war zone when the first few goals went in.

4. The noise, honestly words don't do it justice. My ears have just recovered. 

5. The other songs! They weren't just Stevie and Suarez. Henderson and Coutinho's songs were the most popular players songs. But the new Brendan Rodgers song was the main one and quite rightly.

http://youtu.be/MqUgxm7E9fk

6. The game, do I need to say anymore? 

7. When Sterling got subbed. Wow. The whole ground gave him a standing ovation.

8. The Spurs fans. Top support, and hilarious songs! 

9. Brendo and the teams passion, at the end they walked over to the Kop to thank us. And the battle cry the Kop let out boys! Every single player and Kopite had to get goosebumps or they are not one of the famous reds at heart. 

10. And most importantly, the famous Kopites! There is no other stand like it, we are brothers all dreaming about the same thing. Everyone understood what it means to be in the Kop and it is our right to support our team the Liverpool way. One typical cynical fan shouted at every mistake we made for the first five minutes. The Kopites sorted that out and told him to shut the fuck up. Even at 4-0 I had to remind him of the score. Sit in another stand if this is you and you are thinking of going this year, this is not the way of the Kop. We don't forget our history and we had the classic songs about our heroes to : http://youtu.be/i-dXqENEX2w

Brendo has embraced what Shankly did here and is playing the Liverpool way, and trust me the Kop celebrated the Liverpool way. If there's anyone like me who has a dad that tells stories about the Kop during the glory days, it felt like the stories that have been told. Some of the old boys tell me it will never be the same as when it was all standing, but last night was definitely a good un (And some of the lads we go with used to actually go and watch Shankly's team!).

That'll have to do for now, I'm bored of writing.

Vladimir Putin was asked to pressure Roman Abramovich to find a place on the Chelsea youth side for the grandson of Kazakhstan's President, the boy's estranged father has claimed.

By Richard Orange, Almaty

9:00PM BST 17 Jul 2011


Rakhat Aliyev, who has been exiled from Kazakhstan since 2007, said that President Nursultan Nazarbayev contacted Putin, who was then Russia's president, to influence Mr Abramovich to favour Aisultan Nazarbayev.

""I met with Abramovich in London for my son because he was interested in playing football for Chelsea,"" Mr Aliyev told the Daily Telegraph.

""Abramovich gave him a trial and he told me, 'Sorry, tell President Nazarbayev that I can't interfere with the team's selection process. I'm like the conductor of an orchestra, and I play with the number one orchestra in world football.'""

When Aisultan returned to Astana, Kazakhtan's capital, to tell his grandfather the bad news, Mr Aliyev claims he was told that Mr Nazarbayev, through his assistant, had already tried to sway the selection.

""He said, 'What can I do? I have already made contact through the Kremlin',"" Mr Aliyev claims. ""The assistant of the president called Putin's assistant to organise this.""",0,1396293570,null,0,false,0,cggo3gg,t3_21up1f,t1_cggo3gg,t3_21up1f,null,1433150695,7,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,7

He didn't say that Paulinho/Eriksen/Lamela would improve from past success, he made the point that they would improve Spurs based on what he saw from them playing (I'm uncertain of whether he meant at Spurs so far this season or at their previous clubs, but this isn't relevant to my point here). He means that he saw them play, and he thought that they were the type of player that could improve Spurs. You might say Soldado had success in Spain, indeed it's just about fact that he did, but he's not saying that if you had success before then you could help Spurs.
