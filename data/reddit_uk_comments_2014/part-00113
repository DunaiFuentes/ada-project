Meritocracy is a reaction to the cronyism of the past (and present). People getting into positions of power simply through having been born to the right family or having gone to the right school. 

The concept of the meritocracy is simply to stop that and to instead have the people who are best and most able.

I wonder what you would consider to be an alternative? 

""but is it really right that people would be denied the best jobs because of something which is outside of their control?""

So we should hand out jobs randomly to people who apply regardless of their experience and/or capability? Of course not, we give jobs to the people who have demonstrated that they are able.

""Except how do you define 'the best and most capable people'""

No-one defines this, each individual does their job as well as they can or as poorly as they can get away with, they are rewarded or not depending on how successful they are.

""The most naturally intelligent? Well that's great if you were born clever""

Unfortunately the genetic lottery isn't kind or fair. If you are born stupid and ugly then you are shit out of luck.

Lerner had a very poor record running the Browns whereas their record seems very impressive. I like their emphasis on appointing people who really know what they are doing to run the sports side of the club while they take care of the finance. I think that's the main thing we have been lacking under Lerner.


A few people have mentioned a great fan experience, emphasis on their academy, good marketing - all of which sounds positive **IF**, of course, they could manage to replicate it in football.


And they are businessmen, this would not be a plaything. Which I think is no bad thing. You can see why they would want the Texas Rangers as it is their local club. There may be an emotional connection, it endears and associates them with people in their community. But there seems little point in them buying Villa (in that they don't have strong emotional ties and can't really make money off it) **unless** they think they can make the club into a significant, visible brand - which would require them to show ambition, invest pretty heavily and get us right up the league.",0,1398101153,null,0,false,0,cgy87iu,t3_23lnhz,t1_cgy87iu,t1_cgy7d23,null,1433455263,3,false,avfc,t5_2s569,3

You could just book advance tickets for every day you have to work, they will become available 10-12 weeks before travel dates so it's a bit tedious.

You could also possibly get a room in a househare really on the outskirts of London for that kind of money, but then transport costs start adding up again (will cost more to commute in if you are in zone 6 etc).

true,p7r,null,null,"The vast, vast majority of content on all BBC channels is produced by independent production companies and sold to the highest bidder. If ""Pointless"" hadn't been bought by the BBC then the production company would probably have successfully sold it to ITV.

Does that make it ""original BBC content""?

I would argue through the question you've raised that you seem to misunderstand how TV works. The BBC doesn't go out and say ""We need Mrs Browns Boys! Somebody make that!"". It is pitched to them, and it's pitched to Sky, and it's pitched to ITV, and in some cases to C4 and C5 and one of them gets to do a deal.

Occasionally they'll just buy stuff in - the BBC has bought in tons of stuff straight up (Family Guy, American Dad Ja'mie all air almost daily on BBC3 and all if it bought in), and as formats that need adapting (but less so than others that basically grab whatever Endemol is pitching that season), and sometimes they'll co-produce with other channels (nearly all the BBC Nature stuff, a few high-budget dramas they know will do well in the US, etc.).

Not many at the BBC are tasked with *producing* original content. They *commission* it from independent production companies. 

That is so different to how you think the BBC operates, I think you need to make sure you understand the full process before you really get into an argument with some stranger on the Internet about it with the level of confidence you seem to have.

As for the violence: GoT is unusually graphic. Arguably it's the most graphic thing ever aired on TV. It is therefore hard to find a comparison in terms of a TV series 

Therefore for comparison we'll have to look to the many, many films that the BBC will - and has - air uncut (especially compared to ITV), and especially very late after the watershed.

I don't think they'd have any problems airing GoT on BBC2 at 11pm, they'd just preface it with a ""this program contains very graphic violence, scenes of a strong sexual nature and very strong language from the beginning"" warning as they do when showing anything else of that nature - e.g. anything produced by Tarantino (they aired Kill Bill uncut).",0,1398105256,null,0,false,0,cgya78n,t3_23i5ki,t1_cgya78n,t1_cgy8xls,null,1433456201,2,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,2

true,layendecker,crest-new,OLD CREST 4EVA,"&gt; the pre-seasons, exactly the same every single year

No, very different. We started with poor results often, but that was not because we were doing the same thing. We tried tougher runs, easier runs or more relaxing breaks. To say we didn't do anything different is utterly ignorant of what we were actually doing. 

What our poor starts (which were not every year) indicate was not Moyesie inability to do something different, it was the struggle he had when we lost important players. 


&gt;he exploited our finances to make himself seem like a godsend.


Better than not exploiting them and getting us relegated mate, which teams with far bigger budgets have done in the time he has been with us. Moyes was a  godsend, and if you don't think so- then you clearly did not watch the 01-02 season, we were nailed on to go down, and he kept us up and built everything we have today from there. If it wasn't for Moyes there is no reason to think that we would ever have got promoted, and we could be in a situation like Derby or Forest have been. 

&gt; how were we unrecognizable? 

How were we not? We changed from being a rough long ball team who tried to hold onto 1-0 wins (2004-05 is calling) and played largely down the middle to a team that played really fucking nice football over the past few years, and one of the great British exponents of modern wing-centric football. 

Flair on the ball has been incorporated, where once upon a time the only thing close to flair was quality long balls. If you think that Moyes would have signed a player like Mirallas in 2007, then you are absolutely nuts. He brought in modern inside forwards, whilst creating a pretty unique transitional attacking system with Osman and Fellaini starting attacks and counters with unified movement down the flanks and most importantly, a huge knowledge of the system by everyone in the team. 

Was he a complete manager? No; had he stagnated in the position? Yes- but that doesn't mean he was anything other than a phenomenal manager. 

Moyes is a unique manager in that he creates a pretty rigid system and the players know exactly what to do in it. That makes us really, really tough to play against; and has allowed very mediocre footballers to look world class at times. Have you ever wondered why so many of our players shit the bed when moving to another team, or playing for their country... It is because they are not very good, and Moyes made them shine.

&gt;how you think that after 11 years, being a below average team turning into an above average team is good progress then i think you don't understand football.

The Dunning–Kruger effect strikes once again. I have just checked your comment history, and it reads like that of a petulant child. You make some pretty out there points, then get defensive when people make a counter argument against them. How is calling someone an 'ugly cunt' helping you articulate a point? Grow up, learn how to form an argument for discussion and you will have a great time on /r/soccer, but until you can inject a bit of humility, understanding for others, and intelligence- keep your shit to the Youtube comment threads.  

I have been a large Moyes detractor over the past few years for various reasons, but to say he wasn't doing anything different shows that you have a huge misunderstanding of football. Go back and watch any game from 2004, or even 2008- it is a completely different team. 

He was a great manager for us at a tough time; looking back and saying otherwise is bitter and disrespectful. Moyes may have tried to forget what we did for him, but it doesn't mean we can't take the higher road as supporters.

true,thetasigma4,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"The best places are season 1, season 7, season 12, season 27, and season 31. 

Season 1 is the beginning of 50 years of Doctor Who and is the introduction of everything and has a story arc which creates the Doctor we know today. It is however old sci-fi so is slowly paced and has wobbly sets, black and white etc. and is plagued with missing episodes (97 as of now).

 Season 7 marks the moving into colour and a new format with the Doctor trapped on earth. It is an incredibly strong season and it is one of the few with a fairly consistent setting  and character base with the entire UNIT crew. It is also pretty slowly paced but has more action than with the first two doctors.

Season 12 is the introduction of the most popular doctor and is also a very good season. It also has the most popular companion and is  better paced and the serials (the stories are all made up of multiple parts and are called serials but for the classic series only) are considerably shorter compared to the previous two starting points (which may or may not be good for you)

Season 27. The first of the New series. It is a logical start point and has the most modern pacing as well as some very strong episodes but a lot of cheese and a few issues finding Doctor Who's place on modern TV

Season 31. The first big change in the New series. Doctor Who has now found its place on modern TV the pacing is even better than in series 1/ season 27. It also has a less human Doctor compared to the New series other two Doctors as well as introducing a three season story arc.

These, I think, are the best starting points in Doctor Who. However these miss out on some great Doctor Who such as the entire Second Doctor (apart from the first option) etc. but as the Classic series had few story arcs you also have the option of jumping around a lot to which i will give you this list of some of the best episodes:

1: His pure historicals are good (IMO) such as The Aztecs, Reign of Terror and the Romans. The First Three serials are also good (including the first Dalek serial. Time meddler I also enjoy. Also the Tenth Planet is good

2: If you don't mind reconstructions Power of the Daleks, Macra Terror, and Evil of the Daleks are Good but if you do the following are also good, Mind Robber, Invasion, War Games, Tomb of the Cybermen, Enemy of the World

3: His entire first series is amazing (IMO) so watch all of that and then maybe Green Death, The Three Doctors, The Seas Devils, Carnival of Monsters and The Time Warrior

4: First series is mostly great especially Arc in Space and Genesis of the Daleks( easily one of the best stories of Doctor Who ever). Then there are Terror of the Zygons, Planet of Evil, Brain of Morbius, Horror of Fang Rock, Terror of Weng-Chiang (unfortunately a bit racist but a good story nonetheless), Sun Makers, Key to Time (Classic Who's first long story arc), City of Death, Logopolis.

5:Kinda, Snakedance, Black Orchid, Earthshock, Cave of Androzani are all good

6:Vengance on Varos and the Trial of a Time Lord (second long story arc Classic who did)

7:Happiness Patrol, Remembrance of the Daleks, Greatest show in the Galaxy an his entire last season are all good

8: Movie unsurprisingly. This is not a great story but Paul McGann is excellent in it

I will add almost everything by Robert Holmes is fantastic. Full list of episodes and synopses (for the classic series) here for you to have a look and decide which serials you find interesting: http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/index_first.shtml

edit: Also for the New doctors (even though they have more of a story arc so jumping about is less advisable especially for eleven) :

9: Dalek, Father's Day, Boom Town are all good

10: Human nature/Family of blood, Midnight, Girl in the Fireplace, Blink, Waters of Mars, Forest of the Dead/Silence in the Library

11: Eleventh Hour, Vincent and the Doctor, Amy's choice, The Pandorica Opens/The Big Bang, God Complex, the Girl who waited, Cold War, and the Crimson Horror. Although the last two people will probably disagree with me on I like them very much so take that into consideration.

They have tried it before with the right to buy scheme and shared ownership schemes. The houses eventually drift back up to market rates, the subsidy ends up in someone's bank account.

They should certainly try to ensure that the houses are not snapped up by private landlords. But the only way to make housing affordable is to build a lot more of it.

Most of McDermott's signings have been poor. Only Smith can be considered a success and to a degree Murphy and Butland. All we heard for months is how we needed genuine width and pace in our team yet now that he has his two preferred choices for width they have been both ineffective and out of the team (I'm aware that Kebe is injured but why buy Stewart and shove him on the bench non stop).

I don't think AVB is a bad manager. I think he's an ok manager but he's also very adpept at marketing himself.

He took an unbalanced but exciting Spurs team and after Bale departed, managed to turn it into a sterile, joyless team that couldn't score goals and by the end of his tenure, couldn't defend either. Despite this, he walked into the Zenit job, and continues to be linked with all the best teams in Europe. I think he gets by partly on his record at Porto, and partly because he's seen as a young, ""progressive"" manager, who is media-trained, polite and charming.

I started university in the nineties.  It wasn't **as** bad then, but already a degree was becoming mandatory for a great many jobs.  Jobs for which by all rights you didn't need a degree.

Even then you could see plenty of students who had taken non-vocational courses - Courses which many of whom had started having been told some variation of, *""Follow your hearts/interests!""* - Finding themselves near unemployable and starting off on post-graduate courses in computer science or business management to correct for this.

The vast bonus of holding a degree was a historical relic even then.  

It's not a bad thing to get more education.  As a state we can afford a few extra years of lesser economic activity after mandatory education.  *(I worked throughout the time I was at university.  In my experience most students do.)*  What it isn't and hasn't been for more than two decades is a golden ticket.

And that's before, on the grounds of it being so, you heap several tens of thousands of pounds of debts on people.

Alternative, is to have Ramires go there. But I really think we need him in CDM to hold off their counter attacks (with Matic unavailable).

But by having Willian play at right back it means Schurrle can start on the right hand side as well, having those two overlap on the right would cause absolute nightmare for Filipe/Godin.

Also, swapping Terry/Cahill around, prefer to have Cahill cover Costa who is the faster striker and let Terry and Villa go at it in a game of 'who positions themselves best wins' (both being slower than earlier in their careers).

First of all, the UK and England are not the same thing. You previously said England absorbed or conquered these other countries, not the UK.
Second of all, you probably mean Britain. The UK didn't exist before all of these countries joined together.

I guess with Wales you're almost right. Wales was at one point part of the ""Kingdom of England"" (because the Normans invaded both countries thus unifying them) but this kingdom had previously comprised of the kingdoms of Kent, Sussex, East Anglia, etc etc so if Wales was ""absorbed/conquered"" by England then Minnesota and New York were also ""absorbed/conquered"" by the USA
(Note: after the Norman invasion Wales was made legally part of England by Henry VII who was of Welsh descent)

Scotland requested to become part of Britain. Their king took over the throne of England which united the two countries under the same monarch. Then after falling on difficult financial times after their efforts of developing an empire failed they asked to join England and Wales. And they did. Which formed the kingdom of Great Britain.

Ireland... Ireland was under English (and then British) rule for a long time but wasn't annexed by Britain until 1800. This created the United Kingdom (of Great Britain and Ireland) but Ireland has never actually been part of England or Britain at any time.
Recently, The majority of Ireland became independent from the UK (creating the Republic of Ireland and The United Kingdom of a Great Britain and Northern Ireland)

Either way, yes of course there is ""segregation"" because Scottish people live in Scotland and Welsh people live in Wales and English people live in England. Just like Texans live in Texas and Californians live in California!

true,yakubu22,null,null,"ok so you can't even read let alone argue a point. you honestly haven't got a clue mate. david moyes' pre-seasons are the exact same every single year. do you know what the objective of the pre-season is? it is to get back into the competitive phase gradually. this means low intensity training sessions. every single year, david moyes would run his high intensity training sessions and sandwhich it all in between league 1 and 2 opponents. this constantly ran the team into the ground before the start of the season, while playing against underwhelming opposition providing no competition at all and providing possible demoralising results from losing to ""airbus fc"". this happened every year, and without looking at results, but looking at performances (obviously something you lack), it was extremely lethargic. There was no energy in performances, no motivation, slow and boring build up play. how you can say this didn't happen every season even though everton earned the tag of slow starters, then you're thick as shit.

he exploited our finances meaning that he constantly said ""were so poor, i'm a brilliant manager for making everton top 8, beating utd, chelsea, city at home"" all a load of shite, loads of teams can beat the top 4 at home (wba, newcastle, sunderland, swansea), thats nothing special, he never beat arsenal, and he never beat any of the top 4 away. all this constantly making excuses up.

hmm, the 2001-2002 season. ye i definitely recall it a lot better than you. we definitely weren't nailed on favourites to go down and in the games moyes had left in charge he had the record of 3W 1D 4L. nothing short of amazing. the teams who went down were miles worse, and obviously were the favourites to go down.

this is where youre stupid as fuck pal. the 2012-2013 season was without a doubt the most longball i've ever seen in my life at goodison park. yeah we did play down the middle, but we played long fucking balls to fellaini constantly. there were a few nice team goals here and there but everyone gets goals like them. 

im not even going to read much more because you're fucking daft. if you think that moyes would have passed up a player like mirallas in 2007 then you're fucking stupid. osman rarely started counter attacks or attacks, and fellaini was too far up the pitch to start anything at all, so im not so sure what this ""unique transitional attacking system"" is. 

how is moyes a unique manager for his rigid system? a lot of the manager have this so called unique system of having players do certain jobs and not do others. this doesn't make us a tough team at all, this makes us an extremely easy team to beat. theres a thing called pre-match scouting. it leads to having your tactics found out, which happened a lot. if they're shite but look world class under moyes, then what about martinez? if martinez has made the team completely better with individual performances from players, then surely by your logic that martinez is the greater manager. you give far too much praise towards a manager, there are 11 players on that pitch that do the hard work. lescott without jagielka isn't as good, but quality for england with them pairing (clean sheet v spain standout performance). pienaar without baines was useless, not because of moyes, but because of his partner. i guarentee you, if a team signed baines and pienaar, they'd have excelled equally if not better. 

the dunning-kruger effect strikers once again blah blah blah, you haven't even argued this point which is obviously right. any pretty out there point i have said is completely valid and plausible, and it's not being defensive at all its called insult to injury, it doesn't matter if i call someone a name, the fact that it means you stop arguing points and change the subject means that you are a stupid dickhead who has lost. calling someone an ugly cunt doesn't help me articulate a point, but i'm not a fucking journalist and neither are you and using big words doesn't help you articulate a point either it just makes you look like a cunt. until you can learn to understand a bit of football, keep your shite to your /r/soccer, givemesport and bleachereport or any other shit website where people think they know their football.

the 2004-2008 is a different team because there is different players, it's still moyes' fundamentals and moyes' tactics. even his 2003 team and his 2012 team.

you need to get your head out of his arse and stop sucking his dick. its supporters like you what makes the media viewpoint of everton correct. you have no clue about everton at all.

The point I was making was that Arsenals run in is in fact not 'harder and tougher' compared to ourselves and that this is a myth from fans and the media. I myself said theirs is harder because they're playing 'lesser' teams with the expectation of winning and being able to relax but having the prospect of being caught cold and beaten. While we, play teams around us (United, Southampton and Citeh) with the pressure on us to up our game and win. 

Backing this up by showing our record vs Citeh at home and the fact that United wouldn't be as tough as people think because of how Goodison would react, this part was fully vindicated. Southampton and Hull will be on their holidays as their seasons are effectively over. Southampton can't really move in the table and before playing us, Hull have 3 or 4 games in the space of 2 weeks with a cup final looming and that our own downfall in those games would be ourselves, making it hard for ourselves.

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxford,"Just want to say first that I appreciate you coming and bringing the other side to the debate regardless of the downvotes.

I can't speak for all the lefties, but  my own opinion is that benefits aren't too low, not at all. In a lot of cases, I think they're too high. The issue is how difficult it is to prove you need it. That is what (I think) is driving people to need food banks, the delays, hurdles and sanctions that seem to be the norm in the benefits system now. That needs to be fixed so that the benefits are going to the right people at the right time. Fixing this is not an easy task admittedly, but part of the problem is people being so cynical and always assuming the worst of people. 

Now, talking specifically about food banks, imagine how much it would cost to actually fully assess every applicant that comes through the door. How long would it take? Who's going to pay for it? The charity? And all that expense and hassle just to make sure that they can't take a few pounds worth of basic food? It's just food, let them have it! 

In fact, my own personal opinion is that benefits should be reformed so that cash payments are minimal. Most of the necessities should be directly provided by the government itself or coupons provided to be used at the shops. Perhaps instead of giving £X per month for food, just give the the food, or coupons for the food. That might help reduce the incentive for abuse that DM readers are so worried about and therefore reduce the expense and hassle required to check everyone.

The reality of the competition is barely any different than the FA or League Cup, but just add in that you might have to travel 3000 miles to face your opponent. 

On our day I can see us taking points off anyone. We've beaten every side that made it into the CL from England but for Chelsea (so far). We can certainly get ourselves out of the group stages.

But beyond that we'll likely need a number of reinforcements to save us when injuries and stamina let us down.

We need a new backup keeper.

We may be fine depth wise in our fullback positions.

We are fine depth wise at CB.

We need another CM who can change a game from that position and who can add some steel that Allen doesn't possess.

We need another striker who is a guaranteed scorer of goals. Some might say we need another winger, but I'm as of yet convinced of that - despite the fact we seem to be pursuing wingers.

As I said in another comment, all that is left to do is to get a certificate of health 10 days before we fly, and we should avoid quarantine. 

For anyone going through this as well, I'd recommend going to a ""breeder's"" vet, vs. your standard one. The reason for this is that breeders often have to ship their animals to other countries for stud services, etc., and the larger vets that care for these animals are better equipped to help their clientele with the logistics of moving an animal to a new country. My cat is a purebred, so I just kept going to my breeder's vet because they were already familiar with the breed--no particular reason outside of that. But I'm glad I stuck with them, because their experience with shipping animals internationally definitely helped planning my pet's travel go more smoothly, and they had a couple of different microchip types on hand, depending on where I'd be going.

The tiny minority of benefit claimants rolling on government cash is such a small problem, but still one that is pretty ridiculous. I think the guardian found there to be 5 households making over £100,000/year in benefits. Such a tiny number, but still ridiculous. That should be stopped, but not at the expense of people in real need like yourself.

That's why I actually support a flat cap. Seems simple to enforce without adversely affecting the people like yourself. Same guardian article found the £26,000 cap would affect about 50,000 households. 

The cap could solve that little problem but it's only a small, pretty insignificant problem.

Go back to Football Manager. That's just a stupid accusation.

I remember a number of occasions (this season) where he'll have the ball in the center of the park or, worse, around our box, and someone will just thug him off it. 

His attacking movements have improved drastically it has to be said, but that could simply be a result of the system. It seems obvious to me that, every time he makes those runs forward, he's about as comfortable as someone with shoes on ice. Even when he's dangerous, he never looks dangerous.

Henderson, on the other hand, I think has proven so measured, composed, and strong anywhere you throw him. Ultimately I expect we will need a 3rd CM who is not debatably talented. 

This year our optimal side has involved a lot of fluidity, but for the most part its a 4-1-2-3. With Coutinho and Henderson basically playing CM positions. This has worked because Coutinho and Sterling have been unbelievable tracking back. Sterling has been for a while but Coutinho really figured that part of his game out in January. 

To keep us fresh and able to rotate based on who we're playing against, I think we need a new, top(ish), more athletic or at least strong CM. Gerrard is playing DLP. Hendo is Box to Box. Lucas and Allen fail at some part or other of what we need from the other CM. They'll get lots of game time because we'll rotate. But I don't think we'll confuse them with being first choice.

I understand your train of thought. But it relies on a lot of things that are more fragile than you realise. Things like pay rises, continuing employment, interest rates, your forecast of the London property market being accurate, finding tenants and your dad and girfriend being able to contribute.

Over the next decade your life will inevitably take some unexpected turns. You don't have much room to maneuver if you are aiming for a huge mortgage with your repayments being *just about* affordable in the ideal case. In fact you are putting yourself at a huge risk.

Within my handful of closest friends* in London (including myself in this set), here is a list of things that have happened between our early 20s and now.

* Profound unhappiness with work (very common)
* Career change, often effected by further (expensive) study
* Going to work abroad for your employer
* Burning desire to move to the countryside
* Break-ups
* Marriage
* Divorce
* Unexpected parenthood
* Serious physical illness
* Serious mental illness
* Bereavement
* Redundancy

**Socially**

About the problems with housemates and tenants. I've never lived with a live-in landlord but a few of my close friends have. Some got on well, some didn't. There's still the potential for unpleasant situations, even if you think the risk is lower.

My first hand experience has been. Renting with friends. Some friends I loved living with and we had loads of fun. Some friends drove me nuts and were terrible housemates. I've also lived with a mix of friends and Gumtree strangers. One guy was awesome and we have become close friends. Some turned out to be unbearable. I've lived with my girlfriend in a shared house. I don't recommend this unless money is tight. The lack of personal space and the diplomacy required to maintain good relations between everyone is too much.

I've lived with just my girlfriend in a flat. This has been great. The WHOLE place is ours, just ours. The living room, the bathroom, the kitchen. No stupid politics about washing up, fridge space or laundry. If we want to rearrange the furniture we don't have to worry what other people will think. If we want to spend the evening making a huge mess in the kitchen we can just do it.

My point is that sharing your place with an as-yet unknown person means it won't really feel like your home. Even if you have a friend in mind for the room they may move somewhere else after a year.

true,AngelicMelancholy,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"I'm doing quite well here, probably because the law and government are *not* religious.

Who the Queen marries doesn't affect the rest of us, so I'm just going to ignore this.

The law is very good at keeping religion away. You have a large amount of religious freedom, and the law does not require you to do anything of a religious nature. And these days, it doesn't forbid you to do anything based on religious guidance.

I don't have any examples of laws that are based on religion, except for the recent marriage debacle. Even then it is just a case of: had the law not been based on religion, then religious people would not have had an objection to gay marriage on their religious grounds. (The only sensible argument that I heard was saying that the word ""marriage"" was defined as given by the bible. In which case the government can use a different word for all legal things.)

Furthermore, the government doesn't take actions based on the bible, or other Christian beliefs.

Unless you have specific examples that I'm not aware of, the only influence Christianity has is on peoples' sense of right and wrong, but that doesn't translate into any actual actions/laws in a way that puts other religions at a disadvantage. For example, MPs can base their moral beliefs on any religion, or just use their own brains to determine right and wrong.

So in this way, Christianity does not hold a special privilege in government. (Ignoring the Monarchy, there are a few Bishops in the House of Lords and that's about it I believe.)",0,1398113228,null,0,false,0,cgye42e,t3_23jo02,t1_cgye42e,t1_cgydter,null,1433458045,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,HannibalAntePortas,null,null,"A lot of people here love Frank de Boer and I can't say I necessarily blame them, but I have a few concerns about him. He has the benefit of managing one of the best organized and cultured clubs in the world in Ajax. As I've said before, Ajax is Ajax and at Ajax de Boer is surrounded by Ajax men who are managing Ajax players who have grown up playing the Ajax way. He didn't create that top to bottom culture. It was already in place and he merely continued it. Though he has done quite well with Ajax, I can't help but think that he has massively benefited from the Ajax culture. My concern with him is whether or not he could replicate that style of football and that top to bottom approach without that culture at this club. Then, supposing that he is able to, would he be given enough time to implement it? I think he'd be worth a shot, but I do have my concerns.

As you said there are quite a few other options that I feel could do a job here. I really like Martinez and was disappointed that we missed out on him, but I don't think he'd leave Everton, especially after having quite the successful season this year.

I also like Thomas Tuchel from Mainz and think he'd be an interesting manager for us. He has done well with them consistently despite having very few resources with which to work. 

I mentioned him a few weeks ago as a dark horse candidate should LVG fall through, but I think Magath might be worth a look. I like his pragmatic approach to the game and he has tons of experience. He did well with Stuttgart and showed that he isn't one to shy away from giving the youth a chance to shine bringing up the likes of Hildebrand and Kuranyi. He won the double in back to back seasons with Bayern. He won the Bundesliga title with Wolfsburg and led Schalke to a second place finish. Despite his goofiness, he wins matches be it with sides facing relegation or with sides in the highest echelons of football as with Bayern.

true,ianrush88,null,null,"Thought some of the examples used here were pretty poor, particularly Neville's.

The examples he gives of dropping too deep look like pretty normal defending to me. When he says the CB's first instincts are to drop off, that's most defenders' instinct (and was definitely Carragher's). If the opposition have the ball close to your box, it's pretty normal to see the defensive line drop a bit inside the box as you don't want to leave space for through balls or crosses between the defence and goal keeper.

For Snodgrass' goal the ball was played into the channel, pulling Skrtel out wide and eventually the cross came in from roughly ten yards from the byline. At no point was Sakho playing any of those wide players onside, and when the cross was played he was in line with it - a good position. If Flanagan had dropped deeper he would more likely have been able to attack the ball rather than getting steam rolled by snodgrass.

The next example is the most ridiculous as Norwich have a throw in in line with the 6 yard box. If our line is pushed up Norwich just throw it to the player 5 yards away (can't be offside) and he has all the space in the world to measure a pass in between defence and keeper for an onrushing forward. And in the modern game with the current offside interpretation there's no way you can do a cavalry charge out to the edge of the box after the throw in is taken. The player on the penalty spot just runs through into the space vacated by all the defenders pushing up. The fault there was simply Sakho's for losing track of his man.

Carragher's examples from the city game were better as we did have a tendency to drop too deep when the ball was being played around in front of us, leaving too much space for Silva.. But it's very difficult to always get it right against a player of that quality, especially when we were playing a midfield primarily set up to attack rather than restrict space.",1,1398114301,null,0,1398115101,0,cgyemv8,t3_23mb2b,t1_cgyemv8,t3_23mb2b,null,1433458292,-1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,-1

Hi, my turborock! My dear, excuse, for a delay of the answer! I even do not
know what to tell first. I simply hope that you will be happy! The most
important, finest news - I did it! I got the visa! I am very happy!!!!
Now!!! I have all news and detalls about my visa!!!
My VISA is valid for 30 days only. And I can stay with you for 1 month maximum!!! 
Is it WELL for you? I hope... After that I should go to Consulate your
country or go back to Russia.. And I have the right to extend the visa for
another 3-6 months!!!
My prince, today I have not stopped on it and later we with my girlfriend at whom
I have stopped in Moscow have gone to office of this airline, company that
reserves airway tickets. I asked them how I can reach Heathrow and how
much it costs. They've told me that the roundtrip flight to your airport
cost 2187 US dollars. It was too expensive for me and I've
asked them to find the cheapest variant. And they've offered. It would be
only on the April 25 I have learned, that cost of tickets up to in one party will
make 685 dollars, I was wondered if it was possible to reserve a ticket and
to pay for it a part of the funds this time and the other part later,
because other people can buy the cheap ticket and I'm not. But they've
refused and I was in despair! I've asked them to help me so long time that
tears have come to my eyes! And they've agreed! I have learned, that now return
tickets are necessary for the proof of that I independently can return to Russia.
But there is an opportunity to change return the ticket on money in your
country, or to change date (Open Ticket). To me have told, that if will take return
tickets the discount at a rate of 5% is given, it turns out that
685+685=1370 dollars and will subtract 5% these are 68 dollars that will
make 1302 dollars, but still it is necessary to add to this sum of 10%
from cost for registration of tickets and meal, it will turn out 1432 dollars,
It was the best variant for me. They have told that I can pay it now, I
have agreed because it is the only chance for me, because I must give to
anti-emigration committee a data about my payment. I went to bank and there
was a huge turn. I long stood and then approached in a window and to me
told that the program doesn't work. I went to other bank, it was necessary
to go at once to this bank, there were no turns and everything well works.
I paid for the ticket. Everything is ok now. It is:
7:35 am Depart Moscow (SVO)
Arrive Heathrow 8:20 pm April 25
I will give you my flight number information, as soon as i have it in my hand. 
I will go tomorrow to the airport, I would like to check all documents and
to learn about rules. Ok turborock, Do you really want to have serious
relations with woman as me? Do you really will meet me in Airport when I
will arrive to you??? I really believe in this with all my heart!!!
turborock I am very glad that the destiny decided to bring together us with
you. I will be always grateful to destiny for this gift. 
Now I am confident., that we shall meet.. My dear turborock, you and your
letters are so necessary for me, you are inseparable part of my life. 
I say about it very serious, because you know how much I miss you my dear turborock, 
I cannot wait to get your next letter. With good news!

Let's take nursing. Nurse Fairhead currently works 40 hours a week, over 5 days. This new proposal becomes law, and he's suddenly working 18 hours a week over 3 days, with no increase in pay. Not only has he just had his pay *halved*, but the hospital also has to hire Nurse Fletcher to cover 18 of those 22 hours that Nurse Fairhead used to work, and there's *still* 4 hours of working time unaccounted for, which would require another nurse to be hired as well.

That's two and a bit nurses now doing the same amount of work that one used to do, for the same pay. I don't think there are enough trained nurses in the UK to cover that gap, tbh. And would they really be more rested? With their pay halved along with their hours, I can imagine they'd be looking for a second job to make ends meet.

Like I said, for the ""low skill"" employment sectors like retail, a shortage of workers might be a good thing, but *only* if the wages for 18 hours were comparable to, or better than, those for working 40 hours a week, which I somehow doubt it would be.

The issue is more that if you can do 40 hours of work in 30, why do it in 40? You could quite easily keep the same pay and have a better quality of life, but the fact is people see 'part time' as 'lazy' or 'unsuccessful'.

A few months later the police told me they'd decided it was her fault but weren't going to prosecute or do any follow up, which is the case for almost all non-fatal bike crashes. 

The police report was sent to the car driver's insurance company who agreed to take liability, the insurance company won't fight a police report, it's not worth it. So no courts were involved at all. I sent copies of all the receipts for bike repairs/doctors notes etc. to them and then they did... something corporate... for about a year before sending a cheque.

I'm not going to assume there isn't at least *one* person out there potentially taking advantage of these food banks, but demand for them hasn't risen for nothing. There are a lot of people in this country who are in poverty and quite a large percentage of those people *work*. What does it tell you about our current government if even working people are forced into food poverty? There's something seriously fucking wrong somewhere, and the fault does NOT lie with the working class.

Food banks have become a necessity in our country - a country that should be wealthy enough to avoid just that. Demand wouldn't rise for no reason. Nobody would *choose* to use a food bank to get a free tin of prunes. They're using them because they're out of options. Why? Well, it could differ from family to family. Perhaps they were teetering on the edge before being hit with the bedroom tax or DLA sanctions and now they've sunk under. 

If a family with children has to resort to a food bank just to make sure their children are fed, I'd rather see a hundred children fed than see them go hungry because 1 person decided to game the system.

Honestly the fact that food banks have to exist at all here is a disgrace. I hope to never see the conservative party elected ever again, not even as a coalition. They're just far too dangerous.

true,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;Teachers and nurses provide an irreplaceable service and should be allowed to strike, while tube drivers get paid ridiculous amounts to sit on their arse all day and can be replaced by an automated system really really fucking easily.

Maybe. When you say *easily* I suspect you underestimate the difficulty and the cost. The cost issue is the one really holding it back, because the state doesn't want to invest any capital in anything.  *(When they DO it's done under PFI or some similarly ropey scheme that ends up costing far more than it was worth.)*  Chances are we'll go from overpaying the Tube drivers to overpaying *(probably even more)* someone else - More likely than not Serco, or G4S or one of that ilk.

In the end though, you're almost certainly right.  Those jobs will be taken over by technology.  They'll be obsolete and while it'll be genuinely unfortunate for the people who lose their livelihoods this is something that happens as we slowly progress.  In a hundred years it'll probably seem as backwards as teams of navvies digging the tube tunnels by hand does now.

That doesn't change the premise though.  It's the reason why tube drivers striking might be counter-productive in their particular case.  It may be the case that in the fullness of time going on strike only hastens their replacement by mechanical systems.  All that said I think it's fair to say that being highly unionised and being willing to take strike action is a very real part of why they're so highly paid.

As a counter-point to that nurses in particular tend to be exceedingly reluctant to strike.  They take their social responsibilities really seriously.  They know the consequences of their withdrawing their labour so they generally don't do it.  The result is that despite the incredible importance of what they do they're undervalued and underpaid.  In fact our government only just vetoed a pay-rise of just 1% as too high!

Still, returning to my original case, if the only reason you can muster for, *""You shouldn't strike!""* is essentially, *""Your striking inconveniences me!""* that's just not good enough.  

You said, *""tube drivers . . . can be replaced by an automated system really really fucking easily.""*  As I said, I don't think it's that easy, but that's what settles that dispute.  Are you worth the money you demand?  Then pay it.  Or *(this is less applicable to essential public services)* are the costs so high that it's not economic to continue the business?  Shut down the business - Stop providing that service.  Or can your job be re-enginered or replaced so I don't need you?  Well, this is where the Tube drivers might come a cropper.  We replace you with automated systems.  I'll tell you right now though, taking that approach with teachers and nurses won't end well.

But you see, *""You're not worth the extra money and I can do something else!""* is fundamentally different to arguing that your fundamental right to withdraw your labour should be subservient to what I want!",0,1398118174,null,0,false,0,cgygg7q,t3_23lqq9,t1_cgygg7q,t1_cgyf3fr,null,1433459211,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

The evidence of this countries christian heritage is clear in everything we do.  Our working week for instance.  Sunday trading laws.

Bare that in mind and yesterday you [couldn't buy from some garden centers](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-27093623) because they were forced to close due to the same sunday licence laws falling on Easter sunday which is, what?

Well, ok Pratchett does have alsymers so I must also assume that the rest are also operating a few sparks short of a full angle grinder.

So British Humanist Society, I charge you thusly.  I want you to follow up on your stupid ill thought out moment of insanity when you put together that joke petition.  If indeed we are a ""secular"" society, let's do away with the sunday licencing laws.  Let the shops open 24/7 regardless what day of the week, holy day, festival it currently is.
Let's abolish having our public holidays dictated to by the same religious feasts.  Nay, lets abolish ALL religious feasts entirely.

true,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;It seems to be a perfectly valid excuse when public sector workers seem so bitter about the pay rises and bonuses that private sector workers get.

I don't recall seeing a single example of the public sector seriously arguing, *""In the private sector they get X, so I want THAT.""*  Where I have seen it is in the context of Civil Service Reform where the public sector are losing contractual rights to bring them into line with the private sector.

Employee A get bonuses and higher pay - Employee B gets a better pension scheme.  Ok, leaving aside the specifics of what value each has we can have parity there, agreed?  When you come along and say to Employee B, *""We're reducing your pension rights, because it's not fair that you have a better pension than Employee A.""* it's not unreasonable for him to respond, *""Sure I have a better pension, but I have lower pay and I don't get bonuses!""*

The pay thing is a particular bone of contention, because the press constantly makes claims that public sector workers are paid more than in the private sector.  However, you might recall that a few years ago the government said it was going to push Civil Servants onto local pay bands because they felt that Civil Servants were overpaid.

The commissioned the Hay Group to carry out the **[analysis work](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/80176/CO_Market_Facing_Pay_Report-10-Dec_2012.PDF)** that would support this.    What this research showed was that Civil Servants weren't in fact overpaid and that the people in the most senior grades were in fact hugely underpaid.  The government quietly shelved the project right after this, which is why you haven't heard anything about it since.

Iran - the nearest they had to any kind of effective war of independence was what Jundullah was doing, their tactics were, if anything, similar to what the IRA were trying to do (bombings, assassination etc), but as soon as Abdul Malek Rigi got caught when the Iranians intercepted that plane and then they hanged him, that was pretty much the end of them as any kind of true force for good, even the USA (along with Iran) designated them a terrorist organisation and for those two to agree on something is pretty rare. 


Pakistan - This is where it gets complicated, so many different tribes looking after their own agenda, you see the odd attack against gas pipelines and stuff against the ISI and people like that, but they've got no chance of getting independance, the ruling Pakistani classes (the Punjabis) need that gas from Balochistan and the West REALLY needs the Pakistani government to help them with the problems with terrorists that come from Pakistan and they will tell the Baloch to fuck the fuck off, because they have nothing to give. If you also look at the tribal situation, you have so many different Baloch tribes, with the Marris and the Bugtis as probably the strongest, because they have better links to the government and better leverage, but not a lot really. The ISI is (allegedly) kidnapping dissenters willy nilly and while the Baloch whine about it, nobody really cares about them. A good example is that the Pakistanis chose Balochistan (specifically the Chagai hills area) to test nuclear weapons in the 70s. 


Afghanistan - Fuck knows what is going on in those areas, it's a complete mess. 

If anyone wants to know more, specifically on the Iranian side of things and the Pakistani side of things (and I hasten to add, I expect these to be pretty biased), I''d suggest watching the following videos. 


I fucking hate Peter Tatchell, but he interviews Mehran Baluch here who 'represents' (and I say that with tongue in cheek) Balochistan at the UN - http://www.veoh.com/watch/v15574249Ka8gKRt6


There's a Dan Rather reports on Balochistan - which covers Balochistan pretty well - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X7KDGsxyp0 (part 2 should be on the same page)


There are more youtube videos but they're in Farsi and I don't have the time to translate.

Firstly if you're considering not restricting (and you're not doing direct access) I'd strongly recommend you do restrict it. It's not worth it, if you have an accident and you can't take your bike back to refit your restrictor kit (cause maybe your in an ambulance) your insurance will be completely void. This could also result in points on your licence, a fine and won't help your case when deciding who's to blame for the crash. You don't wanna be an uninsured rider. You may think you're careful enough to avoid crashes but there's always dick'ed drivers who'll ensure the opposite.

Since my licence is older than yours I've had to restrict my bike to 33bhp but most of what I say will be the same principle for you. 
I've looked into this lots, and from everything I've read, buy a bike which is purpose built to the amount of bhp you're allowed. So for me it'd have been a zx250. I guess the newer zx300 would be ideal for you. 
That being said, if you can't afford that or would prefer a larger bike, buy any bike which is twin cylinder and restrict it. It's easy enough to do, it's a lot cheaper too. Plus getting an older bike means if you drop it (which as a new rider you will) it won't matter - at least not so much, it's heart wrenching when it happens. Also insurance cost for most twins is pretty affordable, and if you were to get a zx300 it'll cost about the same. 
I've had a 33bhp restricted kawasaki gpz500 and it had plenty of torque and was a very enjoyable increase in power from my Honda nsr125 - which are some of the faster 125s.

When you restrict a twin, you knock a bit of power off all round the tacho, so you still get plenty of power throughout.  Whereas if you restrict a 4 cylinder bike, you'll knock off the top power band which is where all your torque is and the bike will feel sluggish and boring. Not to mention the insurance cost as well as a (usually) more unforgiving riding position - which when you're new to the game doesn't help. So I'd recommend not get a cbr600 until you come off your restriction. 

 
If you can afford something more modern, I'd definitely suggest getting a suzuki sv650 which is what I'm now getting, which someone also suggested above. Perfect bike to be restricted and when you can derestrict it I'm told it's like having a brand new bike all over again. For £1000-2000 you can find a one in very good condition. They come in sports as well as naked - both look good and almost anyone would swear they're bullet proof. Ideally you want a 2004+ model which is fuel injected and easier to restrict. I think also the 2007+ models had a couple more upgrades. But a pre 2004 will still be good enough. They're said to be very good for new riders, seeing as they're relatively light and easy to control. 

Hope this helps :)

I get free handouts, not from the state, from my parents, I work for family businesses and when I'm 'good' I'm very good, capable, intelligent and educated meaning I've replaced several consultants, but half the year I'm useless due to episodes of mental illness, I'm still paid because my family feels they should support me, they are understanding as best they can be (they try to understand but don't actually understand it if that makes sense). My mum thinks I'm deserving of help because she trusts me, trusts that I'm doing the best I can in episodes, trust that I'm not lying to get time on mental health wards because she knows I don't enjoy it (but it's easier than them having to keep suicide watch). 

She understands that not all families are as understanding, she understands most aren't in a position to support family members like they can.

I don't know about you but having my team play fun and attacking football when I watch them every game is really important to me. AVB turned us into Stoke.

&gt;For levy to fire AVB half way through the season after the summer we had was a joke and replacing him with a Manger that has 0 experience was a slap in the face.

The firing of AVB was indeed hasty but there was no other man that could take our club in the middle of a season so that's why Tim got the job.

&gt;very very poor in Europe, and lost every cup game

Because Europa League got tougher and tougher as is expected of any cup. The other cups too.

&gt;Also him basically throwing every player under the bus

I don't see how telling the players they don't play well enough is throwing them under the bus. We all know most of the summer buyings disappointed this season, under Tim as well as under AVB. The only difference is AVB didn't have the directness to tell them straight.

Being struck off is an entirely different thing to being sacked, even though Wasp-ish *(probably entirely accidentally)* referred to one while using the figures for the other.

&gt;No teachers have been fired for incompetence in almost half the local authorities in England during the past five years, figures from a TES investigation have revealed.

&gt;Nationally, more than 3,200 teachers have gone through official competency procedures over the same period, figures collated for the first time reveal.

&gt;This resulted in 273 teachers being fired or accepting severance pay and leaving, but in 72 local authorities there are no records of any teachers being removed from their posts.

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; By that logic, should Scotland also have to pay a share for the costs in moving and/or decommissioning Trident?

I think that's a reasonable question. Nuclear material isn't something like a building or a railway, and if Scotland helped create it then there's clearly some responsibility to removing it safely. If Porton Down were based in Scotland then we couldn't simply say ""sorry, don't want biological weapon research here, we're cutting the power to the site"".

However removal by relocating the subs to a US port is quite different from removal by decommissioning those subs and dismantling the warheads. My guess is the former is much more likely than the latter, and that Scotland's share of the costs will essentially be covered by being flexible over the timescale by which they are removed.

I know I perhaps sound a bit like I'm saying this is your fault - I'm not though. I'm just viewing it from how a solicitor would look at it. I'm not a solicitor, but I've taken action against a landlord twice (once successfully, once half successfully), and learnt quite a lot from it. The key is to make sure you do everything by the book, and are reasonable in your demands. That's where most people fall down legally with this stuff - everything in you wants to bring down hell, because it's the place you live, but in the eyes of the law you still need to moderate your demands and act like a reasonable human being. And if you do that, and the landlord doesn't, you're in a far, far stronger situation.

Be aware also, that if you make too much of a fuss and you're past a six month (or one year, depending on your contract) break point in the lease, there's often nothing to stop the landlord serving you notice to move out, which could be inconvenient.

He played himself 21 times in his first season, he scored on the final day to clinch the title against Chelsea. He only played twice in 1987/88 after we signed those lads, he was definitely more manager than player by that point. He did not play at all in 1988/89. His final goal was in April 1987.

Ironically, the very fact that the UK is wealthy is the same reason you need food banks. The UK attracts more immigrants, legally and illegally, than any other country in Europe.

That really isn't anywhere close to true. In fact, it's the worst example you could have picked. 

Stoke, in their notoriously dull but effective period under Tony Pulis, built their entire game plan around *not* having the ball. They were long-ball merchants, averaging 40-45% possession and attempting more long balls than most other teams in the league. They also had appalling pass accuracy (around 70% in 12/13) because they tried to play so many long balls.

Point is, they felt less likely to concede without the ball. AVB's philosophy is that possession is the best form of defence and I don't have to tell you how much possession we averaged under AVB.

The ""boring"" football you were all complaining about was AVB trying to turn spurs into a team who could dominate and control a game from minute 1 to minute 90 and not rely on fast, flowing counter-attacks as we had done under 'Arry and before.

I agree with /u/DogBotherer on the big picture - welfare is a flawed response to a fundamentally unequal and harmful set of social relations - capitalism - and I'm more interested in replacing the way in which we organise society.

However in seeing capitalism as unequal and harmful, I recognise that those that are hit hardest, upon whom capitalism inflicts the greatest suffering, are those who are, for varying largely unfair reasons, very poor. Welfare benefits are one way of ameliorating that harm, and, flawed though they are, I would still, in lieu of more substantive change, like to see larger benefit payments so as to ameliorate suffering more.

He's always been average to inept in defense. That's the truth. Say what you will about his ability to get forward. That mostly is a tool for us to relieve pressure. He's never that dangerous in the final third. He just looks dangerous before an average cross or awful shot.

Glen has never been dangerous enough going forward to justify his being defensively woeful. He's essentially a link man. He can get forward well and do some quality overlaps. That's really helpful, but I think we've seen from Flanno lately that it isn't really impossible for someone to add that to their game. Flanno has been, if still slightly uncomfortable with it, just as dangerous going forward. And although he makes his errors, he can be a brick wall. Which Glen has never been confused for.

And for the Skrtel comparison. I'm not sure he's even improved all that much this season. He's been great. I also don't think he deserved his reputation for ineptitude last season. He's only getting all these plaudits because he's been our most consistent CB (which isn't saying a lot this year) and he's scored goals. Its absolutely nuts how if you score some goals as a defender, everyone glosses over your defensive ability. 

Again, I'm not knocking Skrtel. The issue is last year Rodgers sort of blamed a few players for losses that I don't believe were their fault, and Skrtel happened to be one of them. With Carragher around, it was easier for him to just give the legend a last run about.

So I think that him having been out of the side for so long certainly plays a big part in it.  But yes, I do think that he, and Skrtel, and everyone else is nervous as hell.  We're in a title race, and our forwards are keeping us afloat brilliantly, but I'm not surprised we feel tentative at the back.  You know, the other team has the ball, you feel like you can't take risks with the title on the line.  What does that look like?  Well, it *feels* risky to step out, I think anyone who's played defense can understand that.  You give forwards space to run in behind, you worry about timing and coordination where if one player steps late the other team can break the offside trap, you generally give yourself less margin for error and can end up facing the play looking at your own goal.

Speaking to the Official Site following his substitute league bow, the 19 year old said that the reception he received from the fans did help settle his nerves on the day, but now he's got a taste for it, he wants to build on it and show everyone what he can do.

'It was good to get on the pitch after being on the bench five or six times. The fans gave me a good reception and it meant a lot to me.'

Robinson goes on to say that having been at the club since he was eight years old, to make his league bow for us is a very big thing for him indeed, but now obviously he hopes it's the first of many, and whilst he accepts he's a way off a starting debut yet, and he probably doesn't expect that to come this season, if he can notch up another few substitute appearances - following on from his club debut last September against Spurs in the Capital One Cup - he'll be more than happy with his progress this campaign.

'I want more of it now. It has given me more confidence. The gaffer gave me confidence when he had words in my ear just before I went on, then when the fans reacted like that, it was big for me.'

Manager Paul Lambert has said himself that he had no concerns in throwing Robinson on for his bow, because he believes he has the mental strength to make it at this level - although obviously he still has development to do - and he knows what he's capable of from his under 21 performances this season.

'Callum is only a baby. He's been doing really well for the reserves. He's got years to go before he can be classed as an established professional footballer, but he's on the right ladder. He's been doing great and he deserved his chance.'

Lambert goes on to say that whilst as a player he is 'miles away' from being the finished article yet, which is obvious given his lack of game time and lack of a loan spell out (despite his age of 19, it remains something we still must address in terms of development of younger players), Lambert knew that mentally he was ready and was more likely to play without fear as opposed to be too in awe of the situation, given what the game meant for our league status.

He's got pace and skill, but the thing that sets him apart is his defensive workrate. He gives all his energy for attack and defending which is extremely valuable to a team. Also I can't remember the last time he had a bad game. I remember ONE game where Sterling had a poor game, though I forget who it was against.

Lallana and Hazard both have had games where they were not 100%.

true,Gluestuck,null,null,"Headington is about 15 minutes from the city centre by bus, assuming you get on a bus as soon as your arrive at the bus stop off the top of my head there are buses every 10 minutes or so. That probably doesn't sound too bad but considering Oxford is a reasonably small city most places will take sub 10 minutes on the bus. So It's not too far if you don't mind that bit of travel but compared to the rest of the city places I mentioned its further out. Have a look on google maps to get an idea, its about 2.5 miles away from the centre.

The properties are larger because It's further away from the centre and so is slightly newer than the rest of the city.

Pros of Headington:

It's got pretty much everything you'd need near by since it has its own shopping area (similar to summertown in north oxford, but larger). 

Most of the houses are newer than the rest of the city and are slightly larger as you said.

It has decent access to the city centre and Oxford Brooks university.

It's fairly close to a couple large park/green areas which are nice in the summer.

Cons of Headington:

If you're going to be at Oxford university and not Brooks, it might be a little annoying to get to the relevant college.

The bus route is good but not as good as the rest of the city.

Headington is on a BIG hill (the rest of Oxford is fairly flat). It's fine if you're on a bus obviously but walking or cycling is a bit of a pain.

Lastly, and this could just be my prejudice, but the area is not as nice as most other areas (possibly nicer than cowley road). It's a little more ""chavy"" for want of a better word. Meaning lesser educated, more violent. Again, don't take my word for it, that's just how i've always viewed the place since unless you live in Headington, there isn't really a reason to go there. It's by no means the worst place to live in oxford as blackbird leys, rose hill, and barton are much less desirable. 

One last thing, you might want to consider buying a bicycle rather than bussing since it is much cheaper and most people in oxford cycle.  To put that into perspective, a monthly bus pass which allows you to go anywhere in oxford will cost you £40-50. and an annual one is 400+ i think. A second hand bike will cost you £40, but make sure you get a lock because there is a lot of bike theft in oxford.

I do rate Gylfi, and rate him above some of our other midfielders this year. Especially above Townsend, and Lennon. Both have been abysmal. Chadli is Gylfi's main threat to a starting job. The problem is Gylfi doesn't get enough first team football and hence doesn't get into any form. What I find odd is that when Gylfi does start or comes off the bench, he manages to bang one in, or be involved in the play up to a goal. Those are good signs when you don't start much. 

When Gylfi came to Spurs, he was supposed to fill that VDV Attacking Midfield role, usually the top of a midfield triangle in a 4-3-3. Last year Bale blew up as he was moved farther and farther up the pitch, so there goes that. Under AVB's odd tactics, he never really settled too well with the crunched possession and diabolically lethargic build up. And when you add that we signed Eriksen, Capoue, Lamela, Paulinho in the window, it becomes harder to get a look into the starting line up. Also consider Townsend blew up this year (who I believe is highly overrated). 

In regards to his best position, I don't know. He typically comes off the bench onto the left side, using his ability to cut inside and shoot as an inverted winger (similar to Lamela). He's good on both feet though so he can still cross a ball, which I love. I don't think Gylfi is a good holding midfielder, and I can't say we can depend on him a ton defensively in that regard, but that's why we employ Sandro/Capoue/Bentaleb in that position. I'd say he is equally capable of playing an attacking left and/or attacking mid behind the striker. Obviously, we have Eriksen to play maestro. 

Gylfi is a class player, no doubt -- The issue is he has had to sit back while the board demands the new purchases be thrown into the starting eleven to justify the transfer budget spend. This is similar to Holtby, who we had to send out on loan to Fulham. 

And in that, I wish with both Gylfi and Holtby that they would either integrate them into the squad or move them on to another club. They are good enough for first-team football, especially with a mid-table team. 

Great to hear from you, and if you get a chance to speak to Gylfi, tell him we're backing him for a starting position!",0,1398132722,null,0,false,0,cgyncb2,t3_23l3w7,t1_cgyncb2,t1_cgym5p5,null,1433462530,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

&gt;

&gt;On 1 September 2001 [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_national_football_team) met [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team) during the qualifying stages of the [2002 World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification_(UEFA\)), at the [Olympiastadion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Stadium_(Munich\)) in [Munich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich). England won the game 5–1, abetted by a [hat-trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick) from England striker [Michael Owen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Owen). All of the England goalscorers were [Liverpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.) players.

&gt;The two teams had met most recently in 2000, in what was [the final match at the old Wembley stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_v_Germany_(2000\)). The match ended with a 1–0 victory for Germany, with [Dietmar Hamann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietmar_Hamann) scoring. The last time that England had beaten Germany had been during the [Euro 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2000) competition in June 2000, with a 1–0 win at the [Stade du Pays de Charleroi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_du_Pays_de_Charleroi) in [Belgium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium). [Alan Shearer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Shearer) had scored the winning goal in what was the twilight of his international career. With the exception of that match England had not beaten Germany in competitive football since the [1966 FIFA World Cup Final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1966_FIFA_World_Cup_Final).

Just wanted to point this out, as to not assume their gradual spending with the Rangers would play out the same way in the EPL.
Another thought that is purely speculation. The Rangers were purchased in 2010 for roughly 350£, 57% of the rumored price to purchase Villa, and each owner's net worth seems to be growing at a ridiculous rate each year, according to Forbes. It doesn't seem out of the question that a huge sum could be spent this transfer window, and the overall investment could still be below what they paid for their MLB franchise.

Entry #18

I feel as if I am losing sanity. My work makes less and less sense. When I started this journey, the intentions were pure. The hope was honest. All I wanted to do was find the source, research The Rabbit Hole.

Then I found the Reddit World, which at first seemed beautiful, but I now realize that the true intention was to overwhelm those who dared this journey. I am one of those. And I believe I being overwhelmed.

true,[deleted],null,null,"How can we address this issue as members of the EU?

Bare with my logic here, it's quite simple and simple logic is the logic that makes the most sense, even common sense if you will.

Being members of the EU means that anybody from the EU, including very poor Eastern Europeans, can live here. We are however, a small island nation with finite resources. If we have more people here we use more energy, meaning we import more so inflation rises, the pound becomes worth less and the costs of imports rise with a larger population, increasing the cost of living.

Now, an increased cost of living means as individuals we consume less. There's less to go around. 

So, might it actually be in our national interest to also keep house prices and rent high? In effect, making life here too hard for foreigners with non-native tongues? Meaning with less of them, there's more resources to go round.

But why would our government take such an approach? Well, maybe for decades now we've just had weak governance who cannot stand back and say 'wait Canadians and Aussues cant come here but less culturally akin Eastern Europeans can, who have a lower standard of living and thus, we get more of them? How does that make sense?'.. And they don't really want to ruffle the EU feathers by leaving the EU, so are happy with the status quo rather than doing anything about it.

Plus, India has even been kicking up a fuss over rules for Indian immigrants. And we surely want to keep a huge growing economy like India happy don't we?

So, higher costs of living in rent and mortgages simply outprices immigrants, whilst also hurting native citizens. But as native citizens, we really shouldn't stand for this.

That's my theory anyway, unless anybody else has any real reason why we aren't swamping the nation with cheaper more affordable housing? ",0,1398137816,null,0,false,0,cgypwg0,t3_23lth3,t1_cgypwg0,t3_23lth3,null,1433463732,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Salvio and Maher have always been good talents in my opinion, so we can't rule them out. Personally, Konoplyanka wouldn't be the best transfer for us, he'd be a second-rate version of Kuyt at best. There are plenty of other transfer options out there, like Berardi, Gaitan, Ganso, or Shaqiri/El Shaarawy if we're feeling adventurous. 
 
 
Areas we need to touch up on are the LB/RB positions, (glen Johnson's been looking good these last few games, but he's a bit off in the long term, and we can't keep playing a 19 year old in left back and not expect him to be jaded, especially if he's playing in the World Cup (hopefully).
 
 
Wingers would be our second biggest area to focus on, but we've got much better players in these positions, with Coutinho appearing more frequently there now and Sterling being in amazing form. A back-up striker would probably be the last area to focus on, since Borini should be good to slot right in to the squad. 
 
 
On a side note, Reina's a big problem. It's definite that we can't have both him and Mignolet at the same time, unless Reina accepts a wage cut, but we all know he's a great keeper, and there are plenty of other options for him out there. And so we get left with Jones, who, in my opinion, should be playing in the Championship at best. He can't even hold a starting spot in the Australian national team. So a back-up cheap keeper (not something like Doni again please) would be useful.

Went to college in London, got a job with Logica afterwards, got bored after a year or so and joined a web startup when there was only 4 of us. One of the clients (co-owner of a post-production house in London, in the movie industry) wanted a web coder and offered me part of the company he was forming. Grabbed that one with both hands...

Set up the company (Unique-ID) and we sold systems that helped out post-houses and movie companies. Starting price was about £50k...most movie houses bought 2, one for backup...

Had lunch with George Lucas at ""The Ranch"", sold the system to ILM, used on Star Wars (the latter trilogy), sold to Manix (The Matrix), Bond films, etc... then we had problems of success, we'd never learnt to say ""no. You can't do that"", so our resources started to get outstripped by our commitments. Not good. Company folded :(

Older, wiser team set up SALT, and basically did the same. Managed to attract the attention of an SVP at Apple, who used to come by every trade show and see what we'd been up to. Eventually got bought. That was 10 years ago now...

Moved around inside Apple a bit, got married, got a 2-year old kid, now working in my dream job in Apple R&amp;D as I said. No details - all very hush-hush these days, sorry :)

Last Xmas I got a big bonus, so finally did something I'd wanted to do for years - hired out one of the big directors boxes at Anfield and invited everyone I knew to the match, must have been about 30 of us. Managed to get my (American) wife really into LFC, so we'll worth it :)

It's been an interesting life so far. You'd never have thought I'd be where I am now when I was a skinny 7 year old kid going to Anfield Rd Juniors :) Not so skinny any more though ... :)

Basically I've been lucky in parts and worked my arse off in other parts. Sometimes it's been pretty depressing (firing people who've done nothing to deserve it is the worst thing you can be forced to do. It eats away at you inside), and other times it's been better than sex. Life, really.

Cheers :)

As one of those A&amp;E doctors I worry you might have missed the point.

I'm an emergency medicine trainee, my curriculum, in-house training, courses and reading habits are all about emergency medicine, I can tell you about major trauma and heart attacks and stroke and airway obstruction in a child and how to put in a chest drain and when to refer to neurosurgeons and so on. You can see my curriculum here; http://www.collemergencymed.ac.uk/Training-Exams/Curriculum/Curriculum%20from%20August%202010

At no point have I (or most EM doctors) expressed any particular interest or received any training in the management of chronic pain problems. In fact, this is one of our least pleasant presentations; we don't necessarily have access to your investigations, we don't know what the other doctors who saw you thought, we don't have a great range of drugs to prescribe you, we have no-one to refer you to and a very limited range of investigations. What's more, even if I did have access to all the drugs and investigations, I wouldn't know which would benefit you. So, I'm not surprised you feel like this ED managed you poorly, you saw a doctor who isn't trained in managing your problems in a place that isn't equipped to manage your problems.

Spurs are either the littlest heavyweight or only 1 of 2 cruiserweights--Everton is decidedly middleweight.

&gt;[Adolf Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler) led the [Nazi party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_party) to power in [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany) by appeals to ethnic pride and [conspiracy theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theories) that [blamed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapegoat) [Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_conspiracy) for the nation's [economic troubles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles). He instituted government control over the news media, [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] and used his charisma and great oratorical skills to lead [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany) into a war aimed at expanding its [territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebensraum).

As a mobile phone provider, they're adequate for me - I near enough always have more than enough signal for a phone call (and I live arse end of nowhere). I can't remember the last time I didn't.

They've given me free bolt-ons in the past because I rung up and asked and pointed out I'd been with them for ages - although they don't seem to be doing as many rewards and such as they used to. Their web based live chat is useful though.

My current contract is a HTC One. I pay £27 a month and get unlimited calls and texts and 1gb data.

My only gripe would probably have to be - as other people have said - their data isn't brilliant.

One the one hand you want sport to be competitive but on the other you want children, especially at a young age, to enjoy playing sport without being inhibited by pressure to win.

It should be competitive but there should also be a focus on what was done well and what could be improved rather than a win/lose mentality.

I'm also not sure about the articles take on state vs private schools. In my experience certainly with cricket all the promising young players are snapped up by private schools before they are even 13 years old where they get access to first class coaches and facilities. They also have extra time to hone and improve their games compared to kids at state schools/ at a club. From there they are picked up by the national coaching system and are put on the path to the national side as such.

exams results: which exams? I remember doing SATs every 3 years or so, but being taught by up to 5 different teachers for the same subjects for 1 exam. Do we add some more exams? Are these standardised exams? Who standardises them? If a teachers students then don't do well on this exam, who are we to say it's the teacher who was poor and not e.g. poor guidelines, poor support or resources provided by the school, poor teaching of the teacher etc. And again, it encourages teachers to teach kids what how to pass the exams, rather than understanding the questions.

On a whole migrants claim more in child benefits, housing benefits, less likely to be unemployed, less likely to use state services, less likely to commit fraud etc. than British citizens. If you believe in the free market you should believe in the free movement of people, however in reality its supporters only support the free movement of capital.

The racist anti-immigrants types dominating now have no way of understanding the processes that are at work. Immigration is a way for capital to increase the reserve army of unemployed, and thus undercut the wage of British workers. Any rational person would thus aim their criticism at the cause of this, capital, and its insatiable need for profit at the expense of humans, but in a society dominated by the ideology of capital, where wealth dominates, instead the immigrants themselves are blamed. Blamed for their own attempts to live on this earth. Dividing the working-class across nation has long been a tactic of the bourgeoisie, since it hides their own culpability and redirects working-class anger against ‘the other’.

As for your comments about exams,
&gt;Do we add some more exams? Are these standardised exams? Who standardises them?

We already have a bunch of national standardised exams so that isn't as issue. 

&gt;If a teachers students then don't do well on this exam, who are we to say it's the teacher who was poor and not e.g. poor guidelines, poor support or resources provided by the school, poor teaching of the teacher etc.

If the school is poor then all the teachers will appear bad, clearly thats statistically unlikely and is easy to flag up and investigate further. Schools are also widely assessed (offstead) so thats not hard to work out.

&gt;And again, it encourages teachers to teach kids what how to pass the exams, rather than understanding the questions.

true,mmmmmh,null,null,"I suppose the point I'm getting at is that we don't know how to measure performance of teachers. Sure, you can look at a range of factors, but every teaching style, every child and every subject is different.

&gt; While any 1 individual metric may have weaknesses taking a number of them as a whole should give you a good and accurate impression of how someone is performing.

Combining metrics is creating a new single metric with all the same problems: education isn't black and white. As soon as you bring in metrics, you start turning people away from education - that's not what we need. 

Another anecdote: (therefore totally irrelevant in the context of a debate, but interesting nonetheless) I remember one teacher who wasn't very good at teaching their subject but provided a huge amount of emotional support and encouragement to struggling students. Also, as I said, what about those teachers who don't tick any of the boxes of being a good or nice individual or teacher, but get good grades?

&gt; If the school is poor then all the teachers will appear bad, clearly thats statistically unlikely and is easy to flag up and investigate further. Schools are also widely assessed (offstead) so thats not hard to work out.

Based on what statistics is that unlikely? Poorer schools are likely to not be able to offer the same opportunities and resources to teachers whilst, at the sametime, being harder jobs, and are therefore less likely to attract teachers who value getting paid a decent amount for a challenging job (which, given current uni fees and cost of living, is any half-knowledgeable graduate).

&gt; There are 2 issues here, a) again it wouldn't be the only metric and b) surely this is a problem with the exams not testing people properly then, which is completely separate from a debate on teachers pay.

The issue here is that quantitative metrics are inherently flawed in an environment with so many humans and variables. This is a valid point in response to a comment suggesting paying teachers based on performance (which you suggested be assessed by a set of metrics)

It's easy to say ""yeah, pay teachers based on performance"" but actually coming up with a working metric that accounts for both a childs education and their personal development is near impossible. And the only way to validate such a metric is to turn the future of this country into guinea pigs - something I'd rather avoid, personally.",0,1398161200,null,0,false,0,cgyvme2,t3_23lqq9,t1_cgyvme2,t1_cgyv9es,null,1433466494,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;

&gt;___Jedward's Big Adventure___ is a children's television programme airing on [CBBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBBC). It is hosted by Irish twins [Jedward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedward) (John and Edward Grimes) and follows them as they visit various [UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site) historical sites around the United Kingdom.

&gt;Each teaming up with celebrity guests, the twins are tasked with learning as much about each site as possible, before leading a tour of real tourists and passing on what they've learnt. 

&gt;Two series of five episodes each were produced and broadcast, whilst a third series was extended to 10 episodes, due to be broadcast in January 2014.

Do you agree in principle that a 'better' teacher (however you want to define that) should be paid more than someone who has simply been there a long time?

Like it or not almost every element of modern society now involves quantifying peoples ability, set against that background I don't think it is unreasonable to want to try and reward high performing teachers for their good work.

&gt;I remember one teacher who wasn't very good at teaching their subject but provided a huge amount of emotional support and encouragement to struggling students. Also, as I said, what about those teachers who don't tick any of the boxes of being a good or nice individual or teacher, but get good grades?

Both of those examples are at best a mediocre teacher, certainly neither is good because both are failing to fulfil key tenets of their job description. Thankfully they are not even conflicting so a good teacher can achieve both. 

In my job there are at times conflicting requirements (make sure everyone enjoys themselves Vs make sure no one gets hurt) and yet I am still assessed on my ability to meet both.

Originally the UUP wanted all of Ulster, as it was the Ulster Unionists, and didn't want to concede any ground to the Home Rule side in negotiations over Home Rule. But when partition came the Ulster Unionists only took six of the nine counties ensuring that their province would have a strong unionist majority by ditching the strong republican voting counties. In this sense Northern Ireland was a gerrymandered entity upon its establishment.

I can't quite remember now but I think the idea of partition may have just been a tactic the unionists originally used to stop the Home Rulers from pushing Home Ruler in order to stop partition. When that failed they resorted to establishing the Ulster Volunteers and threaten civil war.

I agree entirely in most cases. But when the consequence of a failed experiment is an entire generations education destroyed, then I'd rather not play with fire.

&gt; Do you agree in principle that a 'better' teacher (however you want to define that) should be paid more than someone who has simply been there a long time?
Like it or not almost every element of modern society now involves quantifying peoples ability, set against that background I don't think it is unreasonable to want to try and reward high performing teachers for their good work.

I'd be for a system of performance related pay that we can prove works in an educational environment. The cold hard truth of [research into this suggests that performance related pay works for mechanical, physical jobs, but has the opposite effect once rudimentary cognitive skills are required](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance-related_pay#Opposition) 

&gt; Both of those examples are at best a mediocre teacher, certainly neither is good because both are failing to fulfil key tenets of their job description. Thankfully they are not even conflicting so a good teacher can achieve both.

I agree, but unfortunately, we [don't have enough enough teachers at the moment](http://www.independent.co.uk/student/news/exclusive-uk-faces-desperate-shortage-of-science-and-maths-teachers-8758266.html) so the last thing we need to be doing is discouraging or sacking educators because they don't meet your arbitrary metrics. After all, a mediocre teacher is better than no teacher at all.

&gt; In my job there are at times conflicting requirements (make sure everyone enjoys themselves Vs make sure no one gets hurt) and yet I am still assessed on my ability to meet both. And I wouldn't have it any other way because I am good at my job and performance assessment means that I earn more now than if pay was only linked to time served.

My OH works in a performance related pay industry, and from what I can see (it's not sales, but the same can be applied to sales industry) the net effect is that customers are commodified so people can keep their job and get a good salary. Again, this is fine on a factory line, or even in sales, but I'd rather not have children, their educations and consequently theirs and the countries future, commodified.

We are not a Christian country, or a Muslim country, or an anything country, we are a Country, with 60 million individuals who mostly all those to live together,  that is supposed to value freedom of speech, freedom of expression and freedom by and large to do your own thing - that's actually what I value most about this country and that's why I get very upset when people make value statements like this.

How much more perfect would it have been if the PM had said "" we are a moral country, we stand up for human rights, we stand up for freedom of speech, for democracy, for freedom of religion, for a mans home to be his castle, for village fetes and tea and crumpets"" - those are values I can get behind and believe in because they do not rely on me choosing a particular fairy tale to follow - everyone could get behind these values - though of course it's much easier to say ""christian"" than to actually live the values of being one, which clearly as a government they do not.

Whether the PM is Christian should IN NO WAY reflect public policy - because all you end up doing is sounding like a religious right wing nut job a la the USA

I dont understand what it is with people in this country at the moment, what with UKIP, the PM espousing Religion and the Daily Mail - none of those parties espouse anything like the meaning of the UK I was brought up in.

&gt;This one interests me, how many people actually support regulation and taxation of sugar (and sweets, biscuits etc.) in the same way things like tobacco and alcohol are restricted? Certainly for me this is a step too far in terms of government intervention into peoples day to day private life. 


I support it to a certain extent. I mean biscuits and chocolate are tasty but it's just ridiculous- they're literally everywhere, it's so much easier to find a simple carb high sugar snack than it is a real piece of valuable nutritious food. Back in the day there was no such thing as snacks - it's something that's been introduced fairly recently.

And on every supermarket shelf there are products labelled ""low fat"", ""no fat"", and ""only 1% fat!"" But our body needs fat, (admittedly not trans-fats etc) and doesn't need added sugar - we get glucose and fructose for energy from our food as it is without the need to add more.

An example of this, have you heard of fluff? It's like liquid marshmallow. Completely made of sugar, and all over is printed no fat, as if it's a health benefit!? 

Sugar is one of the most addictive things we consume. It's caused an obesity epidemic and is killing people.

If Mourinho was any other manager, he would of been sacked. We needed a striker at the start of the season and getting Eto'o was always a gamble, loaning away Lukaku was also a bad decision IMO, he could of played a handful of games at Chelsea after a successful loan spell at WBA, if not loan him out in the January instead. Selling Mata also, no one would of got away with that stunt, and in my opinion we have missed him, as Oscar has been under performing, so has the team.

But let's look at two things, winning all our EPL games and hopefully Liverpool don't win it and overcoming the inform Madrid. We need an explosive finish to the season.

As for over achieving, no i don't think so. We spent enough in the Summer to be title contenders without a doubt.

&gt;A fundamental criticism of performance-related pay is that the performance of a complex job as a whole is reduced to a simple, often single measure of performance.

Which is exactly what we have been talking about here. In my mind there are 2 types of PRP, the first is commission or specific target related pay (eg. car salesman and as discussed in that video) which I agree would be a disaster within teaching.

However the 2nd type is much less clear cut, for instance my pay is reviewed yearly. I meet with my manager, discuss how I've done against the specific targets I was set at the start of the year, discuss my performance in general and the year ahead. He then goes away, talks to colleagues, other managers etc. comes back and tells me a) what my Christmas bonus is and b) what my base pay will be next year, if I'm not happy with his assessment I can appeal. Such a system allows a wide range of criteria to be looked at, including 'soft' skills and let knowledgeable people use their own judgement and common sense.

As an employee I am much happier under the 2nd system than one where pay rises were only linked to time served. It allows my skills and hard work to be recognised. Clearly money isn't my only motivator but not feeling like talent is being recognised is a humongous de motivator personally and performance assessment is one facet of achieving that.

This is a problematic one - a fairer voting system will disadvantage the people who today actually *prefer* the big parties. As such, it will only succeed in a referendum if the big parties become extremely unpopular, or if people explicitly vote against their own interests, or if supporters of smaller parties manage to get leverage. It's the old ""two foxes and a chicken voting over dinner"" thing - it's flawed from the outset.

true,Quagers,null,null,"&gt; But when the consequence of a failed experiment is an entire generations education destroyed, then I'd rather not play with fire.

That is highly alarmist, at the end of the day the people teaching are the same people, a change in their pay structure has the potential to adversely alter their motivation but it is unlikely to destroy an entire generations education.

&gt;I'd be for a system of performance related pay that we can prove works in an educational environment. The cold hard truth of research into this suggests that performance related pay works for mechanical, physical jobs, but has the opposite effect once rudimentary cognitive skills are required

As I replied to another poster I am not calling for turning teachers into car salesman, the primary argument stated on that page is precisely what we are debating. I am arguing for the sort of system used in cognitive jobs in the private sector. From that post,
&gt;for instance my pay is reviewed yearly. I meet with my manager, discuss how I've done against the specific targets I was set at the start of the year, discuss my performance in general and the year ahead. He then goes away, talks to colleagues, other managers etc. comes back and tells me a) what my Christmas bonus is and b) what my base pay will be next year, if I'm not happy with his assessment I can appeal. Such a system allows a wide range of criteria to be looked at, including 'soft' skills and let knowledgeable people use their own judgement and common sense.

&gt; After all, a mediocre teacher is better than no teacher at all.

But that raises the question at if high skilled individuals felt their abilities would be recognised in teaching would more go into it, raising the quality of teachers. The last of high achieving students choosing teaching as a career has long been a problem.

&gt;What benefits do you think performance related pay in schools will bring?

I'd like to turn that around and ask how you justify basing teachers pay purely on time served?

It's similar to the irony of firemen striking (and potentially allowing you to burn to death) because of 'safety'.

&gt;

&gt;The __1994 UEFA Champions League Final__ was a [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) match between [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy) club [Milan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan) and [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain) club [Barcelona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona), played on 18 May 1994 at the [Athens Olympic Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens_Olympic_Stadium) in [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens), [Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece).

&gt;Barcelona were favourites to win their second European title in three years, [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] having just won [La Liga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga). Milan's preparation before the final was in disarray: legendary striker [Marco van Basten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_van_Basten) and £13 million young sensation [Gianluigi Lentini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianluigi_Lentini) (then world's most expensive footballer) were missing through injury; sweeper and legendary captain, [Franco Baresi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco_Baresi) was suspended, as was defender [Alessandro Costacurta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Costacurta); while [UEFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA) regulations limiting teams to fielding a maximum of three non-nationals meant that their coach [Fabio Capello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabio_Capello) was forced to leave out [Florin Răducioiu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florin_R%C4%83ducioiu), [Jean-Pierre Papin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Pierre_Papin) and [Brian Laudrup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Laudrup). At the other side the rule meant that [Michael Laudrup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Laudrup) would not star in the match, this omission triggering his decision to leave [FC Barcelona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona) at the end of the season.

&gt;Milan played in their all-white away strip, which historically they use in finals of the [European Cup/UEFA Champions League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League), while Barcelona played in their red and blue strip. Milan dominated early and were rewarded when [Dejan Savićević](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dejan_Savi%C4%87evi%C4%87) ran down the right flank and passed to [Daniele Massaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniele_Massaro), who tapped the ball into an empty net. Massaro banged in his second just before half-time to make it 2–0 after a solo run by [Roberto Donadoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Donadoni) down the left wing.

One thing that *really* pisses me of, though is seeing things like ""Only 50 calories per 32g portion"", and then having to hunt around the whole package to find out (in tiny little type, hidden behind a fold) that a 32g portion is in fact 39% (or some other percentage that makes it impossible to divide up without digital scales) of a tiny little bag of something that most people would consider one portion for the whole thing.  There's no excuse for this - it's very obviously intended to mislead, and they wouldn't bother doing it unless they have reasons to think it works.

I think stricter labelling requirements could do a lot. Requiring that the total kcal content of the whole package, and a defined standard comparable unit (e.g. 100g, 100ml for fluids) be put in large type on the front would be a fantastic step. 

I bet a lot of chocolates and crisps would see sales plummet if you did this and people could easily see both how dense some products are, and how much they could eat of various other products...

Incidentally, though, I'd also expect sales of juice to drop, and soda to increase: Lots of people buy juice with tons of added sugar that are just as high-calorie, or even worse, than even Coke or Pepsi, thinking they're getting fewer calories. 

Pepsi is around 43kcal per 100ml; while some versions of Tropicana for example, are closer to 50kcal per 100ml. (EDIT: And I just had lunch, and looked at the calories per 100ml of some drinks: Chocolate milk: 75 kcal per 100ml, and while to their credit, 100ml kcal measure was shown, they did not show the full kcal for the 375ml bottle, but for *half* the bottle. Who buys a 375ml bottle and drinks half of it? Anyway, though it may be better for you in terms of fat and protein, if you're counting calories, a 330ml bottle of cola is pretty exactly half the calories of a 375ml bottle of chocolate milk....)

And I agree with you about the ""no fat"" thing. Frankly, when they clearly intend to mislead, regulation of labelling is the least they should expect to face.

Do you find this disgustingly liberal? It's from article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Also, where do you stand on the freedom to cause offence? Do you believe people should be free to publish Mohammed cartoons or wear them on T-shirts? I do. What about the freedom to condemn homosexuality as ""an abomination in the eyes of the Lord""? Being a gay rights activist, I find it offensive, but nowhere near as offensive as the proposal that the speech ought to be banned from public discourse.

I like the following passage.

&gt; The world needs to become comfortable accepting dissenting opinions rather than striving to erase or silence them. The greatest diversity issue of our time is embracing diversity of thought.  Be it in the privacy of your own home, the workplace, or in a public forum, EVERYONE has a right to their opinion. We might not like certain opinions, but censorship via public witch-hunts is not the answer.

&gt; Have you ever noticed that the most intolerant people tend to be those who preach tolerance the most loudly and aggressively? Ah, the intolerance of the tolerant, but I digress… Here’s the thing – nobody owns the patent on free speech, and the right to voice an opinion in the public square is not reserved for any particular group or agenda.

Absolutely. Sainsbury's implemented the traffic light system on packaging and said it didn't effect sales.

The main thing stopping me from deciding on going down this route is that 1) I'm expecting my hours to be pretty long and I feel like any finishes past midnight followed by an hour taxi journey home might be a bit of a nightmare, and 2) I know it's cliché and potentially I'm lying to myself but I do feel like there's value that can be had in having the option to stay later to post-work drinks and not being the person that always leaves early etc.

Sure if it's a massive, miserable commute home then it may not be a good option.

I wouldn't base any major life decisions on not being the person that always leaves work-drinks early. It means you have other things going in your life. Have some self respect man!

If you are expecting to regularly work past the hours when the trains are still running then that sounds quite extreme, even for banking or management consultancy (I assume we're talking about one of these here). Trust me, most people can only tolerate that kind of lifestyle for a few years.

Anyway I've somehow ended up giving unsolicited life advice when you've asked about the finances.

Certainly for me this is a step too far in terms of government intervention into peoples day to day private life.

The suggested regulations by medical groups are largely related to marketing.
For example, sweets shouldn't be marketed on TV.
This has very little to do with personal freedom, I'd argue that the conflation with personal freedom is little more than a lobby group invention (it was used when people said ""you can't market cigarettes to children"" for example).

Sure, people should be free to buy a can of coke or a chocolate bar whenever they want, but people don't choose the influence marketing has upon them as a consequence, why is its regulation such a taboo issue?
Ordinary people don't loose personal freedom because we say you can't show an advert telling people to smoke 30 cigarettes a day or eat 50 burgers a week.

By that argument, slavery is all fine and dandy if a majority supports it. Something doesn't magically become right because it has majority support. That is to a large extent why we have separation of powers, particularly a separate legal system, and put down guarantees of rights in laws: So that a majority can't ride roughshod over minorities.

The problem is this doesn't really help us in the creation of new rights. But as it stands, the current electoral system blatantly denies proper representation to a large part of the population. The fiction that an MP properly represents the whole electorate in their constituency is just that: pure fiction. It's a convenient fiction for the large parties, but it is still just fiction. It is certainly not democracy.

EDIT: In retrospect it is clear that accepting the referendum was a stupid mistake. It was a gamble that they might get more support for it amongst the electorate than amongst MPs, and now the whole debate will be tainted by the referendum for a long time. It will happen eventually, but probably will require even more people to lose all trust in the big parties first. Of course it didn't help that the alternative on offer was a horribly shitty choice.

Sunday trading laws could be argued as competition/employment  laws stronger than allowing people time for religious service etc.

While we allow faith into power taking position in the Lords, it can be argued other faiths are now represented through appointed peers.

Christianity does bury itself within English law, however I believe it's based on common sense and public order to instil laws against murder and theft etc. This is evident as Acts against adultery and not observing the Sabbath don't exist.

true,L__McL,,Who would win us the Cup? Tim sure would.,"Part I:

* Where do you want to see Villa headed for the rest of this season/next season?

I think it's important to try and end well. A win against Hull or Swansea is needed, we don't want to end the season without a win in 9. Next season I can see us sneaking into the top half. Before the 4 losses in a row we were sitting in tenth. With either Lerner or someone else I think we'll invest enough to finish there.

* With the whole manager drama, do you think we should keep Lambert or ditch him?

I stay stick with him. I've said my opinions many times on this sub and I remain a fan of Lambert. I really think next season is the season we'll start seeing the results of what he's trying to do.

* What are your opinions about where we will finish this season?

Around 15th/16th. I think if we get results against Hull and Swansea we should finish above Sunderland, Cardiff, Norwich, West Brom and Fulham. Maybe Swansea as well.

* What do everyone think about potential takeover in the next window? 

I'm intrigued. I like Lerner. I'd be happy for him to stay. However, it's always exciting when there's a possibility of new investment. Hopefully, decent input and help Lambert make the chance of top half and then maybe Europe a reality again. 

* What do you think of the potential new owners and what they could bring to Villa?

From what I've read it seems positive. They seem Lerner-esque in the way they're willing to invest and let those who know what to do spend the money. Thinking optimistically we could have a repeat of Lerner's first years when we came 6th 3 years in a row.

Part II:

* Where do you want to see this sub reddit going, like more subs, more content, what?

I like this sub. It's one of the 3/4 that I regularly visit. I think ideally we'd have more subscribers but that's hardly something we can help. I think content is good, a mix of stories, rumours and discussions is good. 

On match threads, it's apparent that /u/zirrwhale usually does them. For the Palace game the other I did them and without bigging myself up I think the way I did it was the best way. A big pre-match thread so we can all discuss the upcoming game, line-up and stuff in this sub and then one of us does a match thread over on /r/soccer.

Immigrants send money home - actively reducing the economy, in the same way imports do. If you're even saving money, banks use that money for business investments, mortgages, and things that make money when people pay them back with interest. There is no static money, unless you spend cash on gold and put that gold under the floorboards of course.

As you mentioned in your post, this is not racist to question and think about. Personally I absolutely salute any individual who wants to come here and increase the quality of life they live by hard work, it's admirable on a personal level and there really is no two ways about that.

But screaming 'racist', or that I'm ideologically right wing when drawing obvious correlations hinders progress and the betterment of this nation.

I do, the wigs that Judges wear don't make us any more Georgian than we'd otherwise be. These are all just artifacts. Our clocks don't make us Babylonian, a bowler doesn't make us Victorian. Its the cultures and practices that shape a country and we have returned mostly to heathenism. If the UK has a religion then its capitalism, people go the shopping mall more than they do church.

Now, this doesn't derail your entire argument, because ensuring people are still paid enough (especially for low-paying jobs) while working only three days does seem difficult. Further, finding enough people to cover certain skilled jobs would also be difficult.

I don't consider myself violently homophobic, misogynistic or Luddite, and I don't see a contradiction in my views because I don't consider Islam to be inherently violent, homophobic, misogynistic or Luddite compared to other religions. Now perhaps I need to back myself up there. Although there certainly are Muslims who are all of those things, I think it's a much more complex sociological issue related to all sorts of historical and current circumstances. I think that trying to pin it on Islam itself is lazy and an excuse in this case to make a thinly-veiled racist attack on black and Middle Eastern people.

On the violence issue, we have to consider the recent history of the Middle East. The decline of the colonial empires created power vacuums and dictatorships. The creation of Israel didn't help. The region has been torn apart by war upon war for decades. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, much of the resentment about this state of affairs has been directed Westwards.

Homophobia? We in the West have only been tolerant of homosexuality for about 20 years or so. We forget that it was as recently as 2003 that it became legal to talk about homosexuality properly in schools. Alan Turing was sentenced to chemical castration for being who he was. The Middle East does not have such high-quality education as the West. Nor does Africa. This breeds ignorance. We cannot accuse Islam of homophobia whilst ignoring the Christian persecution of gay people in Africa. Religion is not the issue. Ignorance is, and ignorant people will back up their bigotry with whatever they can.

Misogynistic? Again, we forget that we in the West treated women as second-class citizens until at *least* the early 20th century, and arguably well into the '60s or '70s. Switzerland only gave women the right to vote in 1971. As with homophobia, education is the key. Ignorance breeds bigotry. I would also suggest that there's something more sinister going on in places like Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan (under the Taleban) where women are denied education. Denying people education strips them of the power to be a political force in the country.

So what needs changing at Villa? Why are we languishing in the bottom half of the table?

**Money**. Lerner has respect for the clubs traditions and is for most a far greater choice over the likes of Vincent Tan or Assem Allam, who in contrast have little or no respect for the clubs traditions or history and treat them with unwanted rebranding exercises. However, he is unwilling to invest beyond what is required to stay up, and as was noted by former Villa legend Andy Gray recently, has not been attending many games, with all signs pointing to a mutual break-up. His ever increasing restraint on investment along with his recent statement suggests he is looking to depart, and a new owner could bring more money. Money does not buy success, as QPR so graciously displayed, but it does better equip the manager to field a team of players that deserve their spot on the starting eleven. Recent rumours suggest we might get a couple of Americans come in who are little more flush with their cash, but also understand the need to build patiently and leave the manager in control of the reigns when it comes to footballing matters.

**A goal scorer**. Remember the excitement around Villa Park when Benteke was scoring goal after goal? We need him back, and we need him in form. However admirable the work rate of Gabby, Weimann, and Holt, they don’t possess the ability to knock in goals like Benteke. Every team needs a reliable goal scorer; Liverpool have three of them, as do City.

**Faith in PL**. I still firmly believe this man has the managerial ability to do very well for us if he is given the tools to do so. I doubt any other manager that we could potentially attract in his place would be able to do significantly better. Sure, 3 at the back is not a formation any of us like to see but that aside from that, I’m confident we’ve got the right man for the job.

I've seen this expressed quite a few times, but a question: When has this (or in what situation might this) actually had an impact? Apart from the selection of FM/dFM, I can't think of a possible situation where this is likely to be relevant. 

Given the ""other"" parties are capable of supporting a Petition of Concern to make a vote cross-community, a situation where them not counting towards either tally would make an impact requires: A) an overall majority in Stormont supports legislation the ""other"" community wants to stop; B) this includes majorities of both the nationlist and unionist communities; and C) the non-aligned parties would have both the desire and the votes to overturn it through a putative PoC mechanism.

I cannot think of any legislation which would come through under those circumstances, or a mechanism to address this which wouldn't give the ""other"" bloc disproportionate power for their seats.

Specifically the man was an Islamaphobe which is really fucking pertinent to our discussion. To dismiss him as ""scraping the barrel"" is pure blindness. Its less about them being Christian as being local as demonstrating that terrorism is a politically charged practice and religion is merely an accessory to it. It's like stating that people that wear jeans are terrorists, their trousers are unimportant, the religion is unimportant. Almost every single attack is politically motivated.

- Get a rough idea of what your portfolio will hold. What are you looking to invest in? You mention having read up in index funds- if you're interesting in this, do you prefer regular investments (in which case, you're probably looking at funds) or ETFs (for lump sums?). 

- Your portfolio strategy will help determine which type of account is right for you. Look at the supermarkets as well as the big players. Hargreaves Lansdown, Barclays stockbrokers, etc. 

- Make sure you get compliance sign off before you trade. The problem with being a finance lawyer in the City is that trading is burdensome and you might not have thought of this angle yet. You will likely be conflicted from a lot of FTSE purchases.

true,YourLizardOverlord,eng-sussex,Scotland --&gt; West Sussex,"The other fundamental problem with the first type is that people work to the metrics.

I've seen the second type work quite well in a small company because it's easy to see the impact people have on the bottom line. In larger companies I've found it more rigid and vulnerable to internal politics. I've seen ""management by objectives"" go horribly wrong in a large oilfield services company. 

An appraisal system is only as good as the managers and culture. I don't see it working too well in education. In the school my kids attend, they use internal promotion to reward the more competent staff. This works quite well: you're offering people ""autonomy, mastery, and purpose"", and rewarding them financially for the extra responsibility. 

Rather than performance pay, I'd like to see a change in public sector recruitment culture. The best outcome is to avoid employing incompetent staff in the first place. I've been involved in recruiting in both the private and public sector, and I was horrified at public sector recruitment practices. 

I'm used to conducting robust probing interviews, pushing to find the limits of people's talent and experience. But I was advised that I was not even allowed to ask different questions of each candidate. There was no way to drill down into their experience and detect where candidates were pushing the boat out a bit. It's no wonder that sometimes bad teachers are recruited.

That's because no matter what the motives of the speaker, their argument may still be valid. What if Islamic scripture really is ""inherently violent, homophobic, misogynistic or Luddite"", just like the Bible? What should we do then?

On your failures to take the bull by the horns, though our own traditions may very well have been oppressive towards women and gays, and we should bear this in mind before pointing the finger at others, we still have to decide what to do in this country now. Do we protect the right of an openly gay man to walk down a public street near a mosque, or even in a muslim area? Should we allow muslim educationalists, even in publicly funded schools, to sit girls at the back, as is done in some muslim countries, like Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Oman, but not others, like Libya and Egypt? Again, should we allow those hosting debates in public universities to segregate the audience by sex?

Again, where did I say they'd signed up. This entire discussion is pure hyperthetical based on your comment about schools arranging events.

&gt; Noone organizes the friendlies for the kids who want a relatively organized, regular cricket game.

* Kids can want sports events to do but unless they speak up and talk to teachers, they can't expect schools to mindlessly arrange them without any consideration of interest

* Schools can gauge interest but that is no precursor to actually getting people to signup to anything.

* If they get enough interest they can start taking names for events

then one of two things can happen:

* 1) The event gets enough people and goes ahead or
* 2) The event doesn't get enough people and it cancelled

If the event gets organised yet fails because people don't turn up then what can you do?

I've signed up to many things in my time and you know, sometimes they just don't happen.

* This could be genuine interest followed by laziness to attend
* Other unexpected events getting in the way

He's still a good manager despite this year. He didn't only get the job because of Alex Ferguson he has a good record. He has had success with a low budget. Better tactician than Sam especially with underdog teams (Everton was a fortress with him).
RAVEL - big one for me, if Sam leaves Ravel comes back in my eyes (if QPR get promoted that changes I guess) this isn't Moyes specific but he's a manager Ravel might respect.

Cons: He's probably too good for us. I could see him being manager of a team who doesn't need to worry about relegation every year. Maybe Newcastle?
Probably going to have a high wage we'll have to come close to, but we've got Sam Allardyce so thats clearly not an issue.

I will be looking to save regularly at this stage rather than a lump sum (except for perhaps a small kickstarter lump sum) so funds will probably be where I end up.  I have seen people suggest lifestrategy funds which automatically re-distribute for you.  This may be a route I go down initially.

This is where I'm having trouble picking.

&gt;Schools can gauge interest but that is no precursor to actually getting people to signup to anything.

&gt;If they get enough interest they can start taking names for events
then one of two things can happen:

&gt; 1) The event gets enough people and goes ahead or

&gt; 2) The event doesn't get enough people and it cancelled

&gt;If the event gets organised yet fails because people don't turn up then what can you do?

People don't *need* to organize specific events for kids who don't care about winning at the moment, they can just join the regular team with the people who do care about winning.  That's why there's noone asking for events just for the kids who don't care about winning.  The only people concerned about alternative events (not) being set up are the people who are concerned that a lack caring about the end result means they won't try their hardest.

&gt;OR, the kid (with help from parent(s)) could find themselves a good club to attend that doesn't necessarily advocate winning as the be all and end all cutting out the need for the school to do anything.

Why?  They can just join the regular team, they aren't fussed and neither are the schools really.  It's the parents of the competitive kids that don't want them mixing with the kids who don't care about winning, since they might believe that it'll affect the end result and overall performance of the team.

&gt; despite there being Buddhists in America, during the invasion of Vietnam, none of them committed terrorist atrocities during or after that war.

America was at war with Vietnam for ten years and during the war atrocities were commonplace, with near continuous attacks on civilian areas, including suicide bombings. After losing the war the US withdrew and played no further role in Vietnamese politics.

Contrast to the middle east, let's pick Iran for example but you can do this for half a dozen more countries. In the 50s America overthrows the government and installs the brutal government ever seen in Persia. Following 25 years of torture under the direct control of the CIA via [SAVAK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAVAK) the people revolt and stage a revolution which is sold to the masses as a religious one. America then spends the following decades trying to bring down that government, including the constant support of multiple terrorist groups such as [Jundallah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jundallah_%28Iran%29#United_States) and [MEK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mujahideen-e_Khalq#Designation_as_a_terrorist_organization). These groups control most of Asia's opium trade and in the last decade or so have killed a few thousand Iranian policemen. That's a solid 50 years of pure evil behaviour and it took them about 30-40 years before they even began to mirror the US tactics.

Now, please explain to me why you think these situations are even remotely comparable in terms of angering people. What reasons do the Vietnamese have for continuing any forms of counter attacks on the Americans? 

&gt; A quick glance at papers in the last few weeks will show you that Muslims have murdered in the name of Islam in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, India, Syria, Nigeria, Israel, Algeria, and Yemen.

None of those murders were ""in the name of Islam"", they were all a part of a wider political conflict over control of those regions. They are ethnic &amp; political divisions, not religious ones. Religion plays a role in some of their propaganda but it's not a driving force.

&gt; While Christians, Buddhists, Sikhs, Atheists, and Jews, have killed... as good as ZERO. 

You are so totally misinformed about the world that I actually sympathise with your specific hatred of Islam. It makes sense given that you seem to actually believe what you just wrote.

Our drone attacks in Yemen alone over the weekend alone killed approx 60 IIRC. Buddhist violence in Sri Lanka and Burma have killed hundreds in the last couple of years. The entire Israel/Palestine conflict could be viewed in the same way, that's a few thousand dead right there n the last ten years. Atheists? Stalin, Mao, Khmer Rouge, take your pick, there's a few million notches on their belts.

But let me reiterate: NONE of these deaths are ""in the name of"" religion. NONE. Every single one is part of a wider fight for power, often with groups pitting different ethnic groups against each other. Us Brits were great at that back in the day, that's why we split the Kurds between Iraq, Turkey and Syria, that move is still paying off today. The Israelis aren't killing Palestinians and vice-versa because of holy reasons, they are doing it because they disagree on who should be in control of the region. It really is that simple.

true,rubygeek,null,null,"&gt; Not every single minority viewpoint deserves representation such a system is clearly unworkable in practice.

You're setting up a strawman. Yes, it is not practically feasible to represent every single minority viewpoint (though I massively disagree with you about whether or not they deserve to be - the people holding those views are worth just as much as you; if they don't deserve to be heard, neither do you). That does not justify not representing those that *can* be easily represented. 

The UK parliament is large enough that a system like the Norwegian, with multi-seat constituencies, proportional representation *within* each constituency, coupled with a small pool of non-regional seats used to even out representation, would *vastly* change the maths in terms of how mainstream a view needs to be before there'd be a good chance of getting representation.

First past the post is pretty much *the* worst system in use in any country with elections today. There are a wide variety of systems that ensures much better representations of minority viewpoints. It hardly matters which - as a first approximation pretty much *any* other electoral system in actual use outside of dictatorships would be an improvement.

&gt;  What you do have is the same single vote that every single other person in the country has.

That is entirely irrelevant when the voting system makes that vote entirely worthless if your views are not sufficiently aligned with the mainstream. In fact, it is entirely irrelevant for a huge proportion of the population who lives in ""safe seats"" and holds the view of the #2 party in their constituency too - but they at least will tend to get their views reasonably represented via MPs from other constituencies.

&gt; What you don't have is influence over and above the popularity of your opinion

No, what people with many minority viewpoints has, is substantially *less* influence proportional to the popularity of their opinions, by virtue of not getting *any* representation in parliament, even though the viewpoints in many cases are widespread enough that they'd get substantial representation with a more proportional system. 

Compare the EU Parliament elections vs. elections for Westminster. One may assume that people intentionally votes differently, but it is wholly illogical to assume that the huge disparity in voting patterns and representation does not also boil down to the voting system. As such, the EU Parliament elections provides a stark demonstration of how the FPTP system deprives people of adequate representation in Westminster. In fact, for some people with minority views, they are in the bizarre position of being better represented in the EU Parliament, despite the small number of UK representatives there, than in Westminster, where the number of votes behind each MP is vastly smaller.

&gt; Your argument seems to be that under FPTP and our current system of electing MPs you have no representation. But the AV referendum was an example of direct democracy, everyone had exactly the same amount of say and the decision was clear.

For starters: Democracy does not mean majority rule. The term itself means ""rule of the people"". Nobody uses pure majority rule, because the flaws are well understood (see also further below).

The AV referendum was a demonstration of just how flawed FPTP systems are: A minority viewpoint, no matter how large a minority, gets outright ignored rather than lead to negotiations about a solution that works for both sides. Straight up yes/no referendums are in most cases *awful* for democracy, as they offer a method for the majority to provide a veil of legitimacy for steamrollering over minority views without a second thought. 

That might sound great when you're in the majority. The thing is, most of us are not nearly always in the majority, though some are more often than others.

&gt; No its not, its because you enjoy the benefits that living within such a society confers and are unwilling to give those up.

That misses the point entirely. If it was not for the threat of violence if unrepresented minority groups ignored majority decisions, ""such a society"" like this one would not exist in its current form: The majority would need to compromise. It is only because of the willingness to use violence - even against demonstrators - that decisions can be pushed through with the slimmest of majorities instead of compromise. This has nothing to do with democracy.

You'll note that pretty much no society have systems based on straight up majority decisions with no other rules. For a reason: Nobody would want such a system, for fear of ending up on the ""wrong side"" of a fox/chicken dinner scenario. 

Instead we have constitutions (yes, even the UK) that limit government power - if the majority was always ""right"", this would serve no purpose - we have legal systems that can challenge government power - if the majority was always ""right"", there'd be no reason to subject government to legal challenges over laws - we have electoral systems that *all* try to mitigate the effects of straight majority rule (even FPTP - otherwise, why do we not have just a single constituency and give the party that gets the most votes every seat in parliament). 

Pretty much the entire history of popular representation have been a history of slowly, gradually increasing the proportion of the population that gets representation, because we've step by step come to accept that depriving people of representation also reduces the legitimacy of government.

I'd suggest the book [""After the Revolution? Authority in a good Society"", Robert A. Dahl, Yale Press](http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300049640). Despite the title, this is not a left wing work - Dahl was a conservative US professor of political science. It is a celebrated introduction to the problem of representation and decision making, and how straight up majority decisions are largely incompatible with it.

Most online/discount brokers don't charge for dealing funds.

As far as lump sum vs regular goes: Some of the funds I looked at had a dilution levy as an initial % charge when you purchase. As it's a percentage it doesn't matter how you slice it, lump sum or regular.

For the actual broker fees, you probably want to avoid a fixed-fee broker since it works out more expensive for smaller portfolios. In the future you can always transfer your holdings.

Like I said I don't think we should ban sugar, I'm saying there needs to be some serious changes to the way out food is packaged and marketed to us. I don't even think taxing it more is a very good idea. People will be just fat and skint.

But the mentality of saying its all their fault and is a lack of self control isn't a fair way to view the situation. Yes greed does play a part of course, but sugar is addictive, and it's EVERYWHERE. And there's a huge lack of education regarding nutrition. Look at how the schools treat it - they gave pizza for breakfast! And french fries are classed as a  5 a day vegetable.

And regarding self control, I quit smoking and that wasn't down to will power. Will power is a short term way of your mind fighting something and saying NO. It's hard, and it doesn't give long lasting results. A complete change in lifestyle or mindset is the key. But if you don't have the right surroundings or encouragement or knowledge then you're gonna find it incredibly difficult.

I see your point on combinations, our bodies crave fat. But fats aren't the enemy.
Butter, full fat milk, avocados - all really fatty and all are healthier than refined, fortified, added sugar confectionary simple carbs like 'chocolate' bars.

People are misled.
A granola yoghurt, pret a manger salad and a innocent smoothie have more calories than a Big Mac, can of coke and a Krispy Crewe donut. You're getting more nutrients and eating healthier food, sure, but you're still getting fatter.
And sunny delight - when everyone realised that it had the same sugar content as coca cola, they put a bit of calcium in there, and said in the advert ""now with added calcium to help kids teeth build strong teeth"" - it's absurd they can find loopholes and get away with it.

If the government let the people who are supposed to be regulating our food packaging and marketing actually do their job whilst providing proper nutritional education, instead of sucking the cock of the CEO of sugar town, then I think we'd see some progress.",0,1398177500,null,0,false,0,cgz004y,t3_23nycu,t1_cgz004y,t1_cgyxm2p,null,1433468558,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;It's called winning mentality for a reason - not ""whatever mentality"".
Lack of a better option is a reason but so is a laziness to find something more to your suiting.

That's the problem, it's still an assumption.  If someone doesn't care about winning, tries out for the team and still gets picked, does it really matter if they don't care?  By the standards of those selecting the team, they're good enough and fulfil the requirements (and judging by the fact that they tried out, the team fills their fun requirements)

&gt;Your 5aside is irrelevant if you're not trying to win anything.

Is it?  It shows we go into the game not caring about the result, yet putting in the effort to try and score against the other opposition.  Is my anecdote about my wee bro irrelevant as well?
