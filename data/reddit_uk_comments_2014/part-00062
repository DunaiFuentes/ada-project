&gt;""The self-reported effects data contradict the conclusions or implications presented in previous literature reviews that harmful effects stemming from CSA are pervasive and intense in the population of persons with this experience. **Baker and Duncan (1985) found that, although some respondents reported permanent harm stemming from their CSA experiences (4% of males and 13% of females), the overwhelming majority did not (96% of males and 87% of females).** Severe or intense harm would be expected to linger into adulthood, but this did not occur for most respondents in this national sample, according to their self-reports, contradicting the conclusion or implication of intense harm stemming from CSA in the typical case. Meta-analyses of CSA-adjustment relations from the five national studies that reported results of adjustment measures revealed a consistent pattern: SA respondents were less well adjusted than control respondents. Importantly, however, the size of this difference (i.e., effect size) was consistently small in the case of both males and females. The unbiased effect size estimate for males and females combined was ru = .08, which indicates that CSA, assuming that it was responsible for the adjustment difference between SA and control respondents, did not produce intense problems on average.""

&gt;""Many lay persons and professionals believe that child sexual abuse (CSA) causes intense harm, regardless of gender, pervasively in the general population. The authors examined this belief by reviewing 59 studies based on college samples. Meta-analyses revealed that students with CSA were, on average, slightly less well adjusted than controls. However, this poorer adjustment could not be attributed to CSA because family environment (FE) was consistently confounded with CSA, FE explained considerably more adjustment variance than CSA, and CSA-adjustment relations generally became non-significant when studies controlled for FE. Self-reported reactions to and effects from CSA indicated that negative effects were neither pervasive nor typically intense, and that men reacted much less negatively than women. The college data were completely consistent with data from national samples. **Basic beliefs about CSA in the general population were not supported.""**

Shifting gears, I loved today's lineup. The only change I'd make is to get Eriksen involved as I believe he is our best player all things considered. It's very tough to see how we'd edit it though as I feel all 11 are deserving of starting. Maybe have a 4-4-1-1 with him and then Ade at the top and have Soldado come in at roughly the '70 mark for Eriksen. I think Soldado is more talented at setting people up then finding the net and I think it's what he looks to do first when he gets the ball and score second.

* First Doctor was too cold, standoffish, and unloveable; Second Doctor wore fur and was charming.  
* Second Doctor grew to think of himself as a puppet-master; Third Doctor stayed on one planet and got dirt under his nails.  
* Third Doctor was violent and overly humanized from spending too much time on Earth; Fourth Doctor refused to genocide even the Daleks and was much more alien, spending time back on Gallifrey as President.  
* Fourth Doctor was increasingly hard to relate to, being as he was such an ancient alien; Fifth Doctor was more of a hippie (wore vegetables) and more of a team player (not just in the cricket outfit, but in the way he treated the Tardis team).
* Fifth Doctor was too vulnerable and carried around the weight of regrets of letting down his friends; the Sixth Doctor was a dick whom everyone hated -- no friends, no vulnerability.
* Sixth Doctor committed occasional genocide and other hideous egregious crimes because he was basically a bad person.  The Seventh Doctor spent time with a young vulnerable runaway, and in teaching her, learned about himself, also a young vulnerable runaway.
* The Seventh Doctor wasn't careful enough, and occasionally wandered in front of bullets.  The Eighth Doctor paid attention to details, because he was looking for chances to make out with nearby earth girls.

You won't become a *good* pianist unless you have a proper piano or a decent digital piano to play on (the kind that cost upwards of £500) and at least a few lessons to make sure your technique is correct from the outset.  Real pianos are loud.  Digital pianos have a volume control and can be played with headphones.

However, it's very easy to start making music with a cheap MIDI keyboard (like [this](http://www.andertons.co.uk/controller-keyboards/pid18431/cid613/alesis-q49-49-key-usbmidi-keyboard-controller.asp)) and some software.  If you've got a Mac/iPad then GarageBand is a great place to start.  I'm not familiar with equivalent software for windows, but there's plenty of stuff out there.  These give you virtual instruments (pianos, synths, samplers, drum machines, etc) and sequencing/recording functionality so you can record and edit your music, just like a real multi-track recording studio.

As I understand it, if you wanted an Employment Tribunal judge to find in your favour on a claim of sexual discrimination you have to be able to show that you were discriminated against **because** of your gender.  It's not enough to simply show that demographically your group is disadvantaged.

If you take time out of the workforce it'll have an effect on your pay and your opportunities for promotion.  A man who takes a substantial chunk of time off on paternity leave and shortens his working hours will suffer the exact same consequences.

One of the problems that comes with some of the efforts to correct this is that it incentivises discrimination against women in the workforce.  Several years ago Godfrey Bloom was slated for saying that no one in their right mind would employ a woman of child-bearing age.  There are plenty of employers who behave **exactly** the way Bloom described.  You can't effectively challenge it because all they have to do is claim they selected someone else for any acceptable reason they fancy.

.

If you vote small and others vote small, we all benefit from diverse viable political parties, so all voters win.

If you vote small and others vote large, you lose.

If you vote large and others vote small, you win.

If you vote large and others vote large, the current stale political climate of two and a half out of touch arrogant lying authoritarian neoliberal parties remains, they just swap sides in the commons every 10 years, and all voters can be considered the losers.

.

The current voting system is a horrible mess that tends towards a result that noone likes. Noone wants to be the first to change to voting small because that will hand their opponents who vote large the next term in office. Much like nuclear disarmament, everyone has to cooperate in action once, and **not** act in short-sighted self-interest to screw over their opponent.

.

It won't be changed because the two and a half main parties will all assume the 'no' result to the AV referendum represents total satisfaction with the status quo.

true,SportingShooter,null,null,"The Hunting Act also prohibited using dogs to flush a fox to guns. This method was used extensively in Wales, where there's a great deal of forest and a well-hidden fox population. The teams of contractors - called gunpacks - would consist mainly of farmers and often responded to a specific problem fox. I understand the government and some government agencies used gunpacks up until the Hunting Act came into force.

There's no prolonged chase, no red coats or hunting horns. It's a quick and humane way of controlling the fox population which, thanks to the Hunting Act, is now essentially illegal in England and Wales. Phew!

ISA's have an annual allowance, an amount you can put in and avoid being charged tax. If you put in over that amount then it does become liable for tax. These allowances can also be changed by (I'm presuming here) HMRC. That sentence from the bank basically means things can change and if you're a muppet and put in too much then you won't get favourable treatment.

Personally I think that ISA from TSB is good for your needs. It's instant access which is key for someone in your position.

Same here.

&gt; However, to argue that smoking cannabis doesn't cause serious mental health problems for a proportion of the population would be sticking one's head in the sand.

Agreed.  All the more reason to legalise, tax and properly regulate the market.  

I find it interesting to contrast our approach to cannabis (and other illegal drugs) with something like paracetamol.  Paracetamol is a far more dangerous drug in terms of immediate toxicity.  Apparently a dose of 4g (8 x 500mg tablets) is enough to cause permanent liver damage and you can buy that much over the counter in a single packet.  

Most people know the risks of using paracetamol and are able to moderate their intake, thanks to education, limits on the strength of tablets available without prescription and so on.  It doesn't stop desperate people from using it to commit suicide (or attempted suicide), but it reduces the chance of accidental overdose.

I wouldn't dream of buying paracetamol from a dodgy bloke in a pub car park and I'm sure the government, health professionals and other interested parties would be horrified at the idea of it happening.  It's a dangerous drug - you can't leave it up to criminals to control the market! (they would say).

So why not apply the same logic to cannabis, or even heroin for that matter?  People are using them whether they're legal or not.  If we really care about the welfare of these people then we should passing laws that reduce harm to them rather than punishing them for failing to abide to the Daily Mail's puritanical view of what's ""good and proper"".

TL;DR: potentially dangerous drugs should be properly regulated *inside* the law, or they're not being regulated at all.

The next time maybe a week with a one on one interview to get to the bottom of why you're missing appointments with someone who can understand the difference between a completely legitimate excuse and someone who's taking the piss. 



Can you even imagine a situation where you were late for work or ill for a day and 13 weeks worth of pay were then docked?

You'd tell your employer to go fuck themselves, and their job. 

Yet these people can't.

true,[deleted],null,null,"It's difficult enough to obtain concrete proof of actual physical abuse, sexual abuse or neglect. In order to prove that a child is ""at risk of extremism"" you would first have to arrive at an agreed definition of the term (what two people consider to be extreme may differ dramatically), then obtain evidence that the parents hold such views (which they are unlikely to share with the authorities) and be able to demonstrate that the views of the parents were having a detrimental impact on the child. Deciding whether to take someone's child away because of their religious beliefs puts you on very dodgy ground, both legally and ethically. 

Also, is there actually any evidence that children who have been exposed to Islamic extremism will reject the beliefs of the parents once removed from the home? You could argue that taking a child away from their parents for their political/religious beliefs will intensify any feelings of anger or resentment towards non muslims and lead to further radicalisation. 

Unsurprisingly, Boris seems to have a very simplistic view of both child protection and religion. He also fails to acknowledge that their are ""extremists"" in every religion, not just Islam.

To complicate things even more, a substantial number of people in Northern Ireland identify as neither British nor Northern Irish, but as Irish. I don't know if that includes Brendan (I know his son's been capped by the Republic's U19s and that Brendan grew up playing GAA and went to Catholic school, but that's hardly decisive), but it does make things even more complicated. However, since I've never seen anything referring to Rodgers as Irish (just British and Northern Irish) I'd guess that he prefers to be referred to as British.

TLDR: Rodgers is not *British*, but he is British.

Depending on the job it may work better to act middle class. It's usually safe to act middle class, people are used to middle class accents from TV.

What a lot of people do is a mild regional accent like Estuary English or that media Manchester accent a lot of celebs use. You never hear a celeb talking in a full Wigan accent (which is quite difficult to understand for most English people). So just because someone has a regional accent, mate, doesn't mean one isn't posh. It's actually one of the more annoying things some middle class people do, to emphasise their regional accent and their grandad who worked down t'pit, while being quiet about the posh school they went to and their other grandad who was a lord. George Osborne recently tried a more ""matey"" accent but did it hilariously badly.

If you look back to accent history then you can see it's changing remarkably quickly. Read Thomas Hardy - at the time it was a good depiction of rural life but now no one talks with such a pronounced accent, certainly not in Dorset.

The state of the labour market plays a big role unfortunately. With 100 candidates for every job it doesn't work well for a candidate to stroll in and go ""alright geez.""

I'd like you to note that I am explicitly not commenting on the sensibleness of the Treasury.  *(This isn't important.  I'm just teasing. But the comment did make me smile.)*

I'd guess that the Treasury would have been guided by HMRC on tax treatment.

For direct tax purposes Bitcoin clearly **is** a voucher.  It's not cash and it can be traded for money, goods or services.  *(I know that's an extremely broad definition, but it's what the law says.)*  It's not always the case that direct and indirect tax treatment matches, but they generally do.  

Once you diagnose what Bitcoin is for tax purposes the tax treatment follows.

So, they can claim what they liked, but it's not a misclassification, unless *(and this would be an interesting possibility)* they're acknowledging Bitcoin as a currency.",0,1393850012,null,0,false,0,cft5u2c,t3_1zf686,t1_cft5u2c,t1_cft5hql,null,1432636771,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

To a large extent, it is. Pretty much any major event these days generates a significant amount of first-hand reporting on Reddit. The Boston Marathon bombing is one of the biggest ones (partially due to the fallout over false identification of suspects). There's been at least one shooting in the US that had someone in the area sending live updates. And I know I was getting my updates on where the London riots were moving from here.

Given the large subscriber base Reddit has, there's a very good chance a Redditor will be at the scene of any event.

&gt;I've heard of a few cases locally where they've gone for their regular time, and told they've been sanctioned for not attending an interview they never knew about..   A letter may of been sent, but somewhere between DWP's incompetence and Royal Mails' backward business ideas, it's not reached it target.

Yeah, like me. You literally have no proof that you didn't receive a letter and they say they sent one which obviously isn't signed for so it's you against them. One mistake by someone at an understaffed and overcrowded Job Centre is literally you being one step away from being fucked.

I got my letter though, only it stated one date to attend which I planned on doing but forgot to mention the one that was about five days before which I didn't attend because it didn't fucking exist to me without any notification. 

""Sorry, you've been signed off for missing an appointment you should know about magically through the medium of telepathy.""

And they never want to admit to a mistake, it has to be your fault because they've seen it all before so it must mean you're taking the piss as well. A word or advice for people that miss an appointment. *Do not* contact them and be honest about it because honesty will get you sanctioned.

http://i.imgur.com/wB1CIeX.jpg

That's what the rules are. If you contact them within five days of missing the appointment, you get sanctioned. If you *do not* contact them, you just get signed off the dole and then you can sign back on right away once you get confirmation it's ended without any sanction to your name.

I'm very conflicted here....

This feels wrong on many levels, misinformation isn't child abuse, if it were then private/secular/religious schools should be outlawed. 
 Education is one of the few roles of the state and if it's cheaper and easier for teachers to 'educate' your children when you aren't telling them opposing theories at home, then they should try and 're-educate' the parents, combat the problem at it's source.

This is a precedent that mustn't be set. Where do you draw the line? It's always a slippery slope on that roadway to hell, that's paved with good intentions.

If these people are as extreme as is being stated, then they should either be taken into custody or enlightened and educated. Punishing them with what appears to be a clear 'human rights violation' will only enforce the hatred.

..an example...

Little 'Mo' is a young teen in an inner city. He goes to school, has friends, was born and raised in Britain. He's a normal kid, like everyone else he has his problems. Mo is currently conflicted, on one hand he's being taught about life/science/the world at school, and at home he's being told a very different story. A sinister tale with paedophilia, genocide and lessons from the 6th century about survival, morality and the desert. He loves and respects his parents but having grown up in Britain, doesn't quite see eye to eye with some if not all of their extreme views, instead of hiding away from society he has embraced it and some of it conflicts with his parents outdated views. He can see their behaviour from an outside perspective and it doesn't seem right. He later marries, has children sends them to a public school, where they learn about mathematics and biology where they learn that to say ""I don't know"" isn't a crime.

He loves and respects his parents but having grown up in Britain, doesn't quite see eye to eye with some if not all of their extreme views, but the police came yesterday and took his mother and father away. Who are these 'White Devils' as his dad used to call them, and why are they taking his father away? This man loved his family, he worked hard all his life, and now he's being taken away in handcuffs. 'Mo'' ends up in juvenile detention because very few people want to adopt a teenager, he's depressed and furious with his situation, his surroundings and 'the man'. ""Fuck them all, they ruined my life"" is his mantra, ""dad was right"". In 'juvey' he seeks out the words of wisdom of the cellblock cleric/joo-joo/priest/vicar/imam and is taken into the flock.

They used to be a side that were incredibly hard to beat unless you were a side that could just straight-up outplay them. With lesser teams, if they tried to play proper football Man Utd would rip them to shreds, and if they tried to sit back and defend all game they'd wear them down and typically score in the last 10 minutes once their opposition had gotten tired. 

These days they've just lost the ability to grind out results against teams who are happy to sit back, they don't have a strong enough midfield to control and boss the game, and whilst they have a lot of power in their attack they lack any real pace to counter with. It might be the same team that finished top last season, but it's a team that's now a year older when it was already a pretty ageing side in key areas (Giggs, Scholes, Evra, Vidic, Ferdinand, RVP). And they did beat Arsenal at OT in November, but Arsenal for whatever reason completely failed to turn up that game and United still only won 1-0.

I wouldn't say it's a certainty we'll win, because they'll be fired up and I've seen some very mediocre Liverpool sides cause an upset against some much stronger United sides over the years, but I really think they're massively struggling at the moment and will keep sliding unless they can buy 4-5 very good players over the summer.

I think that applied more to last summer than it does today/it will this summer.

When Agger was made VC we didn't have Sakho, and last season Agger was probably our best defender, so when Carra retired Brendan probably wanted someone to try and take over from his organisation at the back, and also Agger has been very loyal to the club so it was a no brainer making him VC really.

However this season Skrtel has really stepped up his game, whereas Agger has had a couple of injuries, his form has fluctuated, and has had to compete with Sakho and Toure which has given Brendan something to think about; flat back four against Southampton comes to mind..

If Agger were to leave I think it would be because he might not be guaranteed a starting spot over a fit, younger Sakho, plus we would be paying high wages for him to sit on the bench.

Whereas if Skrtel were to leave I think it would be if we got a good offer, and a good replacement. 

TL;DR: I think that this summer it would be more likely for AGGER to leave rather than SKRTEL, however it could be very possible that BOTH of them leave. ",0,1393858490,null,0,false,0,cft7wj7,t3_1zdq6g,t1_cft7wj7,t1_cft5e90,null,1432637747,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

* Moyes has gone. Contract ran up and he was chosen by Ferguson to replace him. They are now shit and Moyes is a cunt for belittling us since he left.

* Roberto Martinez is his replacement after winning the FA Cup. His arrival was met with some anxiousness as Wigan went down as they won the cup. Turns out, he's the shit as a manager and all the players were just wank holding him back.

* Fellaini, our record signing, followed Moyes to Man Utd for £27m. We are all happy as he doesn't suit our new sexy style.

* Martinez (a.k.a Bobby Martin) has us playing some slick stuff and we go out to win every game. As it turns out, this is much more fun than playing not to lose like Moyes did... Who would have thought ey?

* We're 6th at the moment and have a big FA Cup quarter-final this weekend against Arsenal. We went there already this year in the league and were unlucky to come away with just a draw (an example of the playing to win every game thing).

* In terms of players; we have very arguably the best RB and LB in the league in Coleman and Baines respectively. These guys bomb forward while Howard in goal, Jags and Distin with Barry (on loan but soon to sign) coming deep from midfield have a strong partnership.

* McCarthy (following Bobby from Wigan) and Barry are a modern day 'Dogs of War' partnership, breaking up play and letting others do the fancy shit.

* Pienaar, Mirallas and youngster Barkley tend to play in front of them. Barkley is a home-grown Liverpool lad and has a shit ton of potential. Mirallas is an exciting winger/striker who likes to run at defenses while Pienaar is slow but him and Baines have an amazing partnership down the left.

* Lukaku is our main striker but is on loan (Everloan Aren't We) and unexpected to stay beyond this year. He's big and scores goals. That's pretty much it for him.

For you as someone living in Ireland, we have a strong Irish contingent at the moment with Coleman, McCarthy, Gibson (injured, get used to this) and McGeady our new winger.",0,1393858611,null,0,1393858937,0,cft7y12,t3_1zfk0f,t1_cft7y12,t3_1zfk0f,null,1432637765,23,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,23

Not really - you're ultimately suggesting than an almost entirely aggregate-based content channel is better than a single provider, and taken in that context, yes it is, but the point ignores how the BBC is uniquely unlike any other provider - you may as well suggest that there's no need for The Guardian or The Independent because reddit is better. So, we look at what it is that's unique about the BBC, and once we stack its' shows against other *individual* providers, then the game is completely different.

&gt;Right, but you said that cbeebies alone is worth the license fee. I disagree, at least for me.

You have no problem with kids having no choice but to watch the likes of the Disney channel, with all the ads and tie-ins that come with it? I'd prefer to at least give people the option. Cbeebies isn't for me personally either, but then that's the point - the BBC is *not* a 'control the content with your $' channel, it's meant for everyone; hence I don't watch Songs of Praise either, but I'm happy it's there for people that do.

&gt; The quality of the shows that Sky hosts has nothing to do with their poor business practices and political biases.

It has everything to do with it, because your $ allows them to enforce wonderful practices like ribbon-tickers about shows you have no interest in being forced on you while you're watching shows you like. And with no BBC as an alternative, do you really think this sort of behaviour would suddenly become more reasonable?

&gt;Are you suggesting that I should dislike programs Sky hosts and prefer the BBC because of how bad their practices are?

I'd suggest you find other ways of watching the shows you want - it's not like Sky have exclusive rights to, say, Breaking Bad. But that raises another good point - the BBC have a mandate and such that stops them from pulling moody maneuvers; Sky have your $, and that's it - and there are too many don't-cares watching it already for your specific $ to make much difference.",0,1393858781,null,0,false,0,cft8036,t3_1yz6xm,t1_cft8036,t1_cft7e5f,null,1432637792,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

That is what I have a problem with. Ideally it wouldn't happen, and if it didn't then you would be right, it would be entirely down to ""their choices"". I'm not even arguing that businesses should be paying pregnant women while they're off.

4-5 months is plenty of time to go out of business when missing a key staff member you are legally unable to replace, then there are all of the admin costs of a temporary replacement,  I agree that they shouldnt assume it's going to hit them in the case fo maternity but I wouldn't force them to keep a job open for that staff member if she chooses to start a family at a really inconvenient time for the business.

&gt;Instead we get all this rubbish about how 'dangerous' it is to hire women of child-bearing age, even if they don't plan to have children in the first place, solely because they can get pregnant.

sure I agree that's BS I agree

&gt;I just hate the argument that taking time off for a pregnancy is somehow unreasonable.

well I'm sorry but I advocate such an argument, taking off more than half a year is going to cause disruption, and at the end of the day nobody is forcing that person to have children, what seems to be being advocated is treating the woman who has had children as if she has been there working the whole time as much as anyone else when it comes to promotion/bonus/pay rise time.

&gt;Men do not have to make the same choice because biologically they cannot get pregnant. They can still biologically have children without being penalised for it.

but this is the point I'm making, it's a choice. she does not have to have kids and if she chooses to she can choose the time.

And no, Image 3, I clearly meant the RB and Bern. Bern is the only defender within the proximity of the ball actually running back at full pelt. Richardson is fairly upright, and orientated centrally, he's not checking Schurrle as he should be and ball watching. I said this in my previous posts.

And to back up the opinion that only the RB and Bern are running, I reference the outcome that Schurrle is challenged just before he gets the shot off by their right back. This is what I mean. Richardson makes no real effort to get back. He just picks up Torres. Heitinga is completely out of position and the RB comes across instead. This is something we end up doing and it often ends up being a hairy affair.

And finally, I am aware Richardson is their LB in this game. But he's grown up as LW and played the majority of games there prior to the end of his Sunderland career. This mentality is what I'm referring to. Richardson doesn't really want to chase, all he wants to do is attack. Which is equally why they got so much joy down that side and why Ramires spent most of his time defensively reinforcing Schurrle. Anyway, that's another argument.

Again, I didn't say anything there I didn't mean. Well aside from accidentally saying thread instead of threat. But I cba to change that anyway.

Had Heitinga not actually tried to play the offside trap they still could have forced Schurrle wide. Without him it's 1v1 and Schurrle won it. The RB does all he can. Heitinga's mistake. Thanks to Torres's movement.

Ivanovic takes a relatively quick throw-in, inasmuch as it goes far in a short amount of time and Richardson doesn't get back goalside in time. This is to be expected given that he was just going for the overlap from Kasami. This is almost definitely why Bern is so far left. I mean it's natural that the defence get pulled across. That's all fine and textbook. If Heitinga hadn't taken himself out of the game then they would have been fine and we'd have lamented our lack of cutting edge. Heitinga spends nearly 3 whole seconds standing still on the halfway line and then doesn't even bust a gut to get back.

Also if they were planning overlaps they probably should have planned for Parker to go wider in transition for a backwards pass, Sidwell to commit and their RB to plug the space. But nevermind, these are all Fulham's failings.

true,Skavau,null,null,"&gt;Not really - you're ultimately suggesting than an almost entirely aggregate-based content channel is better than a single provider,

I already said this earlier, that yes, Sky hosts all sorts of different channels as opposed to the BBC that only hosts their own content. But again, the idea that the BBC (and indeed by extension all the non-BBC British channels) objectively offers the best service is questionable at least. If I had to choose between a TV License and Sky, I'd choose Sky because the content on Sky is more varied than the BBC in my opinion.

&gt;yes it is, but the point ignores how the BBC is uniquely unlike any other provider - you may as well suggest that there's no need for The Guardian or The Independent because reddit is better.

I did not say that there is ""no need"" for the BBC. In addition, I do use Reddit for news more than the Guardian or the Independent. Yes I do recognise the difference in format.

&gt;You have no problem with kids having no choice but to watch the likes of the Disney channel, with all the ads and tie-ins that come with it?

When did I say this? You said that Cbeebies alone is worth the license fee. I replied that it is not for me. At all. Not for millions of people.

&gt;I'd prefer to at least give people the option. 

I was not aware that I was arguing for the option to be taken away.

&gt;Cbeebies isn't for me personally either, but then that's the point - the BBC is not a 'control the content with your $' channel, it's meant for everyone; hence I don't watch Songs of Praise either, but I'm happy it's there for people that do.

So presumably, for you, cbeebies is not worth the license fee. I assume that if the only thing available on the BBC was Cbeebies you would not purchase the license.

&gt;It has everything to do with it, because your $ allows them to enforce wonderful practices like ribbon-tickers about shows you have no interest in being forced on you while you're watching shows you like.

You do not have to watch the adverts, however much you dislike them.

In addition, the 'challenges' that piracy and subscription models on the internet will eventually compel companies to change their practices.

&gt;I'd suggest you find other ways of watching the shows you want - it's not like Sky have exclusive rights to, say, Breaking Bad. But that raises another good point - the BBC have a mandate and such that stops them from pulling moody maneuvers; Sky have your $, and that's it - and there are too many don't-cares watching it already for your specific $ to make much difference.

If we're talking about my practices, who is to say I do use Sky? (I don't, by the way). I'm just pointing out that the BBC is not the best service available in my opinion.",0,1393859281,null,0,false,0,cft86fr,t3_1yz6xm,t1_cft86fr,t1_cft8036,null,1432637876,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

1) ""They offered £40m+£1. What we’ve found ... is that contracts don’t seem to mean a lot in England – actually, in world football.""

2) ""Since apparently these contracts don’t seem to hold, we took the position that we’re just not selling.""

As I said in my original post, the first quote was clearly Henry lamenting player power as right after the ""don't mean a lot"" he talked about players agitating to leave, not honoring contracts, Torres etc. The second quote happened about 3 mins after and I at the time took it as referring back to the 'release clause' not being legally enforceable in England, but looking back it makes more sense that Henry was just making a general statement about the club making a stand against player power.

true,practically_floored,newcr-1,,"Moyes, who was our manager for 11 years, moved to United and is doing pretty badly. They're currently 7th, below us and look likely to finish there for the first time ever. We got Roberto Martinez as our new manager who basically all Evertonians have fallen in love with, he has us playing possession and short passing football, which can be amazing to watch when we're at our best. We beat United at Old Trafford for the first time in 21 years and held Arsenal to a draw at the Emirates in the same week, which was pretty good.

Players to watch out for:

**Ross Barkley** - from our own academy, this is his debut season in our starting 11 and he is amazing. Best talent we've had since Rooney. He's having a dip after coming back from an injury (broken toe) but looked himself again in our last game. Some examples - [a beautiful free kick vs Swansea](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-8qWLvfiqbyA/UrckE7eF-NI/AAAAAAAABH4/iY9ojhD_wCc/s0/22-12-2013-GifNumber-15.gif) and his [Goal vs Norwich.](http://gfycat.com/EvilParchedLabradorretriever)

**Seamus Coleman** - has been a solid right back for years but really stepped up this season. Said Martinez gave him the confidence to make shots on goal, and as a result he has scored some belters. Some examples - [his goal vs QPR](http://gfycat.com/TameDeadAzurewingedmagpie) and his [amazing strike vs Swansea.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-QEXoPIqFny8/Urcfxr0puGI/AAAAAAAABHg/yI7EmDaT16Y/s0/22-12-2013-GifNumber-13.gif)

**Leighton Baines** - United tried to buy him in the summer but failed, and he just signed a new contract for us instead. One of the best left backs in the league (if not the best), also our set piece specialist. He scored two free kicks in our first game against West Ham, either side of the goalie - [1](http://gfycat.com/LimpRectangularAurochs) [2](http://gfycat.com/NauticalPeacefulHoneybadger)

**Kevin Mirallas** - can be a little greedy with the ball, but worth a shout just for his partnership he's forming with Baines over free kicks - scored [this beauty](http://gfycat.com/HorribleAdventurousIridescentshark) last month and tends to take free kicks on the left, while Baines takes them on the right.

Honourable mention to **James McCarthy**, another Irish international that we signed this summer and he is a brilliant player. Not scored for us yet but is so solid in midfield that it allows Baines and Coleman to come forward and score goals. We have a few good loan signings this season too, **Gareth Barry** from City, likely to sign in the summer as he's a free agent. Quality player. **Gerard Deulofeu**, 19 year old from Barcelona, looks set to be a fantastic player although has his faults, looks likely that we'll get him back on loan next season. **Romelu Lukaku**, striker from Chelsea, 20 years old and our top scorer. Has good and bad points, but is a great player while we've got him. 

Finally, I personally love **John Stones**, our 19 year old 3rd choice centre back. Jagielka and Distin are a great pairing, and keep him out of the squad normally, but when he gets the chance to play as centre back he's been great every time, really an exciting prospect for the future.",0,1393859898,null,0,1393860164,0,cft8ego,t3_1zfk0f,t1_cft8ego,t3_1zfk0f,null,1432637980,5,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,5

They're widely acknowledged as being easy! Upon their introduction they nearly destroyed the Scandinavian folk scene, because everybody picked them up instead of the harder traditional instruments.

I'm joking a little, but I think it's a matter of how your brain works. Some people find them really easy, some really hard. I'm good at touch-typing, and I think that skill transfers over - coordinating buttons on two hands at once.

After all, most of those 120 buttons are chords (and you don't use that many chords in a song, so often you'll only be using six or so buttons in a song, including the bass line), so you don't have to learn left-hand chord shapes like you do on piano and guitar. The bellows become just like breathing after a while, you hardly know you're using them, but they're capable of lots of expression.

I'd encourage people to at least try them before writing them off as 'hard' - after all, in only a few minutes you can learn to play a simple song (like 'Wild Thing') with only one finger. Remember, if you're using the bass, chord, and piano buttons all at once, you're doing as much as an entire band of some other instruments.

This way Lucas/Henderson can neutralize Rooney/Mata, and we can have the best short passing team to control possession and release Sturridge/Suarez through the middle.  I think United's soft center is their biggest weakness, which is why I prefer the movement of Suarez/Sturridge/Henderson alongside the passing of Coutinho/Allen.  Sterling to come off the bench for Coutinho in the second half once (fingers crossed) we have a lead, so that he can stretch play more.

*EDIT: Having learned that Gerrard is available, I would play Mignolet; Johnson, Agger, Skrtel, Flanagan; Gerrard, Henderson, Coutinho; Sterling, Suarez, Sturridge.  If Gerrard is in the team, we're not going to be passing triangles in midfield, so it's much more important to have the pace of Sterling and SaS on the flanks.

What did we do? We laughed at them and recycled them.

&gt; I think drinking Coca Cola makes me look more western and contemporary.

I don't think this makes any cultural sense. You might get westerners trying to be Japanese, but UK folk don't tend to be trying to become more ""Western"". Also I have no idea who would drink Coca-Cola to be ""contemporary"". That's more about what you wear and how you act than what you're currently snarfing down. 

&gt; When compared to other brands, Coca Cola is the most suitable choice in such aspects as: Taste, Smell, Price etc.

Haven't seen this question brought up as making no freakin' sense, but this is another one that just doesn't make ANY sense. It's like trying to ask if Coca-cola is your favourite cola, but in a really terrible way. 

Another cultural thing that this survey seems to ignore, is that over here ""alternatives to Coca Cola"" are usually any other fizzy drink. Off-brand colas aren't much of a thing here - they exist, some people drink them, but they're not really seen as a ""thing"". Survey needs to clarify if the ""vs"" questions are for off-brand coke or anything fizzy.

I agree it would be worse to make a post about it, I disagree that it would be worse to say. Many people are understandably irked with someone not in a power position attempting to impose their will on the community. Thats why I said live and let live. I shouldn't have said ""I have no problem."" My problem would be that he felt the need to make a post about it, not that hes making a statement about fans being cunts.

Herein lies the root of the problem. OP has no business policing the community. He should police in the way ever other user does, with his upvotes and downvotes. 

&gt;Just don't think the OP was as wrong as the majority of comments suggest.

And obviously you're entitled to your opinion (I have no issue with it.) I do think that the comments suggesting OP should let people do what they want has some merit given that the community has decided to back those opinions. 

Finally, I personally agree with OPs sentiment, especially because our position isn't assured and its easy enough to end up in an argument on reddit without looking for one.

true,Youngy798,eng-Eastanglia,East Anglia,"A quick search shows a definition such as :

Radicalization (or radicalisation) is a process by which an individual or group comes to adopt increasingly extreme political, social, or religious ideals and aspirations that (1) reject or undermine the status quo[1] or (2) reject and/or undermine contemporary ideas and expressions of freedom of choice. For example, radicalism can originate from a broad social consensus against progressive changes in society. Radicalization can be both violent and nonviolent, although most academic literature focuses on radicalization into violent extremism (RVE).[2] There are multiple pathways that constitute the process of radicalization, which can be independent but are usually mutually reinforcing

One part is very worrying in my opinion, political opinions which go against the status quo. Who decided what that means? Maybe anyone goes against the government will be classed as extreme. 
Would we class christians who have 'extreme' religious views as radicals? Things we think of as extreme now may not seem extreme in the future. Just look at black civil rights in America.

His book value remaining (assuming he was on a 4 year contract- I couldn't find what it was easily) is ~1.75M.  I doubt we'll be able to get that for him and he may well simply be released for nothing, meaning we take a loss of 1.75M for the coming FY on him.  Reina isn't going to generate much either since he's clearly not wanted back at this point.  

Not spending in January is irrelevant- different fiscal year entirely.  

For CL, much depends on whether we place 3rd or 4th as to how much we would eventually get.  It's safe to say 20M or thereabouts is a reasonable low estimate, climbing closer to 50M if we manage to win the thing.  We will get a bit more coin from Standard Chartered if we're in the CL, I seem to remember that adding about 5M or so as part of their contract.  

The increased PL revenue basically takes our club from a loss every year to something closer to break even, so I wouldn't consider that as additive so much as simply offsetting the losses we've been having near every year since FSG came in.

So, I'd say we're maybe 25M to the good as far as guaranteed, mostly based upon the CL revenue.  A 20M player on 100k a week deal for 4 years costs the club over 10M annually (not including all of the incidentals involved in their transfer, like agents fees, VAT, etc.).  Given that CL is not guaranteed beyond next year (assuming we get into it this year), the club can't really afford to go nutso buying players.

Well, you can't really lump all other commercial UK channels in with the BBC - for a start, most of them have copied Sky's you-won't-mind-will-you approach to longer ads and the like - and even ignoring that, they're generally not on a par in terms of programmes anyway.

&gt;objectively offers the best service is questionable at least.

Anything is questionable - but if there was a commercial equivalent that was any good (and not an aggregate), I'm not sure anyone's ever convincingly put it forward as an example.

&gt;So presumably, for you, cbeebies is not worth the license fee. I assume that if the only thing available on the BBC was Cbeebies you would not purchase the license.

Errr..you did read the part where I pointed out that I'm happy to provide the next generation with a no-ads and no-tie-ins channel? As well as my pointing out in multiple posts in this thread that it's not really about what one individual wants - to do so is back to 'I don't use the NHS, why should I have to pay?'. But since you appear to have avoided that issue, please address it directly - what's so bad about providing varied content for everyone, at a lesser price than buying channels from abroad?

You're not? Why shouldn't everyone else have the right to follow your lead? Or have you not considered the ultimate outcome if they did? Even ignoring ads (which Sky force upon everyone even though they're already paying) - do you really think that the actual content won't change in quality or price? Sport has already undergone this - anyone into Football, etc. now has to pay Sky to watch a lot of what they used to get on the BBC. And when this happened, did they refuse to do so in order to ensure things would carry on the way they had for decades? No, they all paid, so now they all pay a huge amount compared to the portion of the license fee that covered this. This kind of thing is what will happen to *all* content if there isn't a much, much cheaper offering that doesn't have ads either for the likes of Sky to compete against; I'd carry on paying the license fee for that reason alone.

&gt;You do not have to watch the adverts, however much you dislike them.

Sure. That's not a stupid statement in any way at all.

You don't *have* to watch the into/ titles/ etc. on DVD's and Blu-Rays either - I guess the overwhelmingly huge number of people that complain about them just want an excuse.

&gt;In addition, the 'challenges' that piracy and subscription models on the internet will eventually compel companies to change their practices.

It's certainly stopped them making the UK wait six months for new US content while they drive the prices up. Other than that, I haven't noticed anyone talking about the likes of Sky reducing the ads and such - far from it, The Simpsons movie even made a point of satirising the fact that they've gotten *worse*.

&gt;If we're talking about my practices, who is to say I do use Sky? (I don't, by the way).

You as in 'someone that defends Sky as a perfectly reasonable alternative to the BBC as a justification for not paying the license fee'.

&gt; I'm just pointing out that the BBC is not the best service available in my opinion.

Well we've already separated aggregates from content providers, so it's on you to name a better offering of the latter. And why it's such a bad idea to pay a relatively small fee to provide radio/ TV/ internet content to everyone.",0,1393862960,null,0,false,0,cft9lw2,t3_1yz6xm,t1_cft9lw2,t1_cft86fr,null,1432638549,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; In 2011 the state of California's own ""federal district courts"" (which is a blurry line I don't claim to understand) started going after dispensaries despite their own law saying they were legal.

The relationship between California and the Federal government is a *bit* like the relationship between Britain and Europe.

This is a very loose generalisation, so don't take it too literally, and I'll explain a bit more.

In principle the US federal government (Obama, the White House and Washington DC) only deal with foreign affairs and ""interstate commerce"" - all other laws are left to the states. 

The idea behind this is that all the states get to rule themselves - to define assault, murder, theft and so on how they wish. States should be able to establish things like consumer laws and what your rights are if you buy a product and it breaks down 3 weeks later.

Remember that the US was formed from these various territories and colonies which has overthrown foreign rule - they didn't want to be ruled by a distant central power. So the states would be like ""little kingdoms"", except with voters instead of hereditary kings.

Originally, the only purpose of the federal government was criminals who operated in multiple states (i.e. equivalent to a European-wide police task force) and to stop Louisiana imposing import taxes on cotton or whiskey imported from Mississippi (like we agree to free trade with France and other EU countries).

Over time, the federal government has extended the remit of ""interstate commerce"", allowing it to meddle in pretty much whatever it likes.

Gun manufacturers have to put serial numbers on guns because they might be used in the commission of felonies in adjacent states, there are federal food preparation standards because a grocery chain buying the readymeals you make might wish to sell them in their store across state lines.

People born in Denver don't have a Colorado passport, but are citizens of the United States. They don't need a passport to travel to Utah, just as we have free right to travel to France (and live and work there). The federal government issues Coloradans their passports, because that's a matter of foreign affairs.

Federal judges and prosecutors operating in California may have been born in the state, and they almost certainly live there, but they're employed by DC to enforce federal laws. All this to address your statement ""California's own federal district courts"" - the federal district court in which they work is located in California, but does not belong to California.

I hope you find this explanation helpful.

Just think, if he put aside two or three years insurance fees, he'd be able to jump into all kinds of powerful / fancy / semi exotic motors.

I lumped them in with them because in order to watch them on the television in the UK you need a license (I know you can watch them on their respective online players) but to watch them traditionally, you need to buy into a license. That's somewhat unfair.

&gt;Errr..you did read the part where I pointed out that I'm happy to provide the next generation with a no-ads and no-tie-ins channel? As well as my pointing out in multiple posts in this thread that it's not really about what one individual wants - to do so is back to 'I don't use the NHS, why should I have to pay?'

Wait wait wait

Are you suggesting that the TV License should be mandatory? That people who have no intention of ever watching television should buy into it?

&gt;But since you appear to have avoided that issue, please address it directly - what's so bad about providing varied content for everyone, at a lesser price than buying channels from abroad?

I don't object to the BBC. I don't object to the BBC providing a service. It should not be a mandatory tax though (as you appear to be suggesting).

&gt;You're not? Why shouldn't everyone else have the right to follow your lead?

What is ""my lead"" exactly?

&gt;Even ignoring ads (which Sky force upon everyone even though they're already paying) - do you really think that the actual content won't change in quality or price?

I do not use Sky by the way.

&gt;You don't have to watch the into/ titles/ etc. on DVD's and Blu-Rays either - I guess the overwhelmingly huge number of people that complain about them just want an excuse.

I'm not sure what your point is about advertisements here. Yes, they're annoying and the introduction/titles/spam on DVDs is unacceptable. You've bought into the product and should not be expected to watch that (this is just one reason why film piracy is successful: convenience). 

You could argue that subscribers of Sky should be more pissed off than they are at adverts because they are subscribers. 

Okay.

Now what? What is your point advertisement here other than them being annoying?

&gt;It's certainly stopped them making the UK wait six months for new US content while they drive the prices up. Other than that, I haven't noticed anyone talking about the likes of Sky reducing the ads and such - far from it, The Simpsons movie even made a point of satirising the fact that they've gotten worse.

Well I am not sure about advertisements but the industry clogs along slowly.

The idea of a television schedule and television channels is beginning to become an outdated concept now anyway. They will have to change soon and the BBC will too, actually. 

&gt;You as in 'someone that defends Sky as a perfectly reasonable alternative to the BBC as a justification for not paying the license fee'.

I don't need a justification for not paying the license fee. It is not a mandatory tax. I don't watch BBC programs. 

&gt;Well we've already separated aggregates from content providers, so it's on you to name a better offering of the latter.

This really is irrelevant. Sky offers a broader array of content (albeit with advertisements) and the vast amounts of material available on the internet or through other services just outdoes the BBC on major scales of interest to me such as serial dramas, sports, comedy (though the BBC has been very good there).

&gt; And why it's such a bad idea to pay a relatively small fee to provide radio/ TV/ internet content to everyone.

It isn't. Someone who wants to watch the BBC is welcome to buy into their services. Someone who thinks the BBC is swell is also welcome to buy into their services. 

Some people however, who don't watch it, don't watch it. They thus do not pay the license fee. Recall I only replied to you originally because you were condemning people for using the iPlayer and not paying the license fee.

&gt;I can now tell you hospital records data on individuals released by @HSCIC in Sept 2013 was publicly available online.

Does this mean people could directly access the raw pseudo-database via the cloud even without appropriate permissions? The HSCIC statement suggests the contrary:

&gt;The NHS IC had written confirmation from PA Consulting prior to the agreement being signed that no Google staff would be able to access the data; access continued to be restricted to the individuals named in the data sharing agreement.

So either Goldacre has been misinformed, or PA Consulting have done something very, very wrong when uploading the data, and should be reprimanded accordingly. There's nothing inherently wrong with using a secure cloud to process massive amounts of data, provided it's managed properly. What's unclear at the current moment is whether appropriate safeguards were instituted and abided by.

Goldacre's more recent statement suggests that PA Consulting have committed a data breach unrelated to the cloud, by publishing analyses containing small sub-groups:

&gt;So @HSCIC released HES data to a company who incompetently presented it online breaching the small number rule. 

This would refer to an instance where data have been tabulated and made public in a manner that potentially permits the identification of individuals (e.g. a table cross-tabulating a disease of low incidence by a small region or time, where a sub-category comprises &lt;5 cases). It remains to be seen precisely what data were made public and in what form. Information concerning small numbers and the publication of data can be found [here](http://www.hscic.gov.uk/media/1592/HES-analysis-guide/pdf/HES_Analysis_Guide_Jan_2014.pdf).

**Update 2** 

Turns out that the publication of interactive mapped HES data on the Earthware UK website used [**mock**](https://twitter.com/bengoldacre/status/440576479248662528/photo/1/large) data. 

**Update 1**

The small number issue appears to be separate from any concerns surrounding the use of a Google cloud, and instead refers to the mapping of HES data by a company called [Earthware UK](http://www.hscic.gov.uk/article/3947/Statement-Use-of-data-by-Earthware-UK). According to Goldacre:

&gt;[...] told me that in one practice there was one patient in one month admitted for one condition.

I always find it odd that people would pick Stoke as a free pick team but if you ever came to Stoke during a matchday, people would appreciate and respect you on a level unlike any of the big clubs with thousands of foreign fans. 

Growing up from Stoke it's great to be a Stoke fan as all your friends watch/follow the games and every 3rd car you see will have a Stoke sticker in the back window. Plus being in the lower leagues for so long makes it still feel great to see the potters on match of the day.

Slow riding is important to master as it becomes a bit more difficult on bigger bikes which are heavier and will likely have a greater turning radius. They will also have more powerful brakes and the front brake tends to be more powerful so locking it up is much easier at slow speed. Exclude the use of the front brake for slow speed things, unless of course using only the rear would cause a collision.

Clutch control, just make sure you really have it down pat, so you can go onto a step hill and hold the bike stationary by using the clutch and throttle, regulate your speed using the clutch and so on. Accurate clutch control will make riding a bigger bike quite a bit safer.

Allen is a Box to Box Midfielder and has done well for us when he's been put on; Isco/Suso are more of a creative and attacking mid, and Suso has been utilized more on the right wing as an inverted winger so he'd offer up a different option to a more traditional winger such as Sterling.

I think that the team is stronger with Montoya than a healthy Enrique. Montoya will have all the backup that Enrique does this year but without the history of injury. 

Isco may not happen. It's been rumored which is where I started this list. Rakitic is another option. I do think there will be a high value CM coming in this summer.

So they let you opt out. 

Then because too many people opted out they postpone it 6 months

Then it turns out that you cannot opt out of the hospital database only the GP database (which is postponed)

Then we find out today it was all uploaded publicly and freely available already (hospital) 

I really do Hate this government; How can people keep missing the point that this government is only interested in supported business and finding ways to exploit the existing infrastructure to turn a quick profit for themselves and their friends. I cannot see the younger generations (once they start voting :?) ever letting them back in power. 

Also I love that the Tories this morning blamed Miliband for the stuff in Ukraine. http://uk.news.yahoo.com/miliband-blame-ukraine-crisis-tories-094535289.html#2XgTM0x its like anything and everything will be spun to make the other party look bad. 

I one day hope that a government party will come to power that will retrospectively go back over the Tories rule and find if they did abuse their power and how many laws they broken. I would vote for any party that offered to do an inquest it to the Tory government (and the labor government before that) I would love for all the current politicians to be reviewed. Anyone that is found making decisions based of what is best for them, their friends rather than the country as a whole should be treated as a traitor and it is time we did something about these people selling this county to line their own pockets. Any just to deter anyone else from doing it, any politicians found to be selling out this country for their own pocket should have ALL their family money removed. 

It is time to remove the blue blood from Government, they are becoming increasingly reckless as they feel they are above the law (which they mostly are)

Coates £1.1m

In: Yevhen Konoplyanka £16m (the amount of his release clause), Will Hughes £6.2m (would likely cost double that), Alberto Moreno £8.8, Victor Valdes Free, Martin Montoya Free

The window is mainly about increasing depth. 

We need another keeper as our third keeper is last seasons U21 keeper. Ward is highly rated but considering his age we need more cover. If Valdes is happy to come and only play half the games, then he would be a good Kolo style signing. He'd come in for two seasons and we can use the time to find a longer term replacement. 

Full back is an urgent area to reinforce. Enrique will hopefully start next season back to full fitness but we still need more than one senior natural left sided fullback. A right sided fullback will also help what with Johnson looking like next season may be his last with us. That is why I've pipped for the two young but experienced Spanish fullbacks. 

Cover for midfield is also important. With Gerrard and Lucas at defensive mid, the need for defensive midfield cover is lower for the time being but we still need extra bodies in midfield. Will Hughes would be a good replacement for Hendo as the young and learning CM in the team. Hendo has really been forced to play far too much this season so an extra quality man in midfield will mean we don't feel we need to play Hendo in every cup and CL game.

Kono replaces Moses in the squad, though hopefully with a lot more participation in the season. Suarez and Sturridge have backup through Aspas and Borini. Coutinho has backup in Suso.

 [**Long and short scales**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long%20and%20short%20scales): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;The **long and short scales** are two of several different large-number naming systems used throughout the world for integer [powers of ten](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powers_of_10). The names are from the [English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language) translation of the [French](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language) terms échelle longue and échelle courte. Many countries, including most in [continental Europe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Europe) and [Latin America](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America), use the long scale whereas most [English-speaking countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-speaking_world) and [Arabic-speaking countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_where_Arabic_is_an_official_language) use the short scale. In all such countries, the number names are translated into the local language, but retain a name similarity due to shared [etymology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology). Some languages, particularly in [East Asia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia) and [South Asia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia), have large number naming systems that are different from both the long and short scales.

true,valerianroz,null,null,"4th year Sussex student here. Lived in East Slope in my first year. It really depends what sort of first year you are looking for as to which accommodation to choose (ie if you want lots of parties, choose East Slope. If you dont, dont, as it can get noisy!)

East Slope was a brilliant place to live, if a little grimy (couple of flats down from me they had woodlouse infestation lolz). Best parties I've ever been to happened at East Slope! I also LOVED the kitchen/dining area and believe this to be the best shared space in accommodation available.

I'm pretty sure East Slope is going to be knocked down soon for redevelopment. If you have the option to choose to live there, you may be the last group ever! (It was built in the 70s and most who did live there are extremely nostalgic about living on the slope. One of my friends had some random people turn up at their front door because they used to live there decades ago and wanted to see if it had changed at all!)

Also, I agree with the above comment. Brighthelm has a really nice layout like a real house (kitchen and dining area downstairs with patio doors, some bedrooms on ground floor and the rest upstairs). And they are the only halls to have a washing machine. It's quite annoying to have to use the launderette otherwise. However, I did have a friend who lived in Brighthelm and the entire rest of his house were quiet international students, so he ended up moving into the empty room in my East Slope flat :)

Don't know that much about the rest of the accommodation options. My sister lived in York House which was alright, not much kitchen space though which can get pretty annoying. 

Another friend lived in Swanborough, which is very close to the rest of the campus buildings where lectures are held, and the Co-op. These flats have a huge kitchen/living area too which is a bonus. I think these rooms are mostly ensuite. 

If you were looking to live somewhere a little more independent off campus, you could think about the University owned halls which are actually in the centre of Brighton. I don't know what the buildings are like but it's another option :)

If you've got any questions feel free to PM me!

John Henry doesn't say things accidentally. He's not out there bragging and sticking his foot in his mouth.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt; That's somewhat unfair.

Not really - if a BBC equivalent had become apparent, there would be grounds for asking why we need to pay for the same via a license; but it doesn't really float anyway - all the others are a) not as good, b) do not provide radio and other services, and c) do not receive any of the fee, generating their income through ads (which is why the concept of charging *and then showing ads anyway* is a bit bizarre.

&gt;Are you suggesting that the TV License should be mandatory?

Generally, it is mandatory. If you own a TV capable of receiving BBC, that's usually it. Hence 98% of viewers pay for it.

&gt;That people who have no intention of ever watching television should buy into it?

You mean like the Fire Service, Police force and NHS services I've never used? What shall I do, complain that I'm paying for other people, or enjoy the fact that I get better content by paying for less? You've (so far) asserted that an aggregate of the rest of the world provides a better overall service, which as pointed out is akin to insisting that reddit is better than the Independent,. so why does the latter need to exist. You could list the top ten shows (from Breaking Bad downwards), and that still wouldn't be true because of the number of other services the BBC provide that the others don't.

&gt;Well I am not sure about advertisements

If there was any chance that people wouldn't mind, ad-channels would get higher figures in the UK, and the take-up of Sky/ Virgin would be greater. And that's before we get to '150 channels and nothing's on'.

&gt;The idea of a television schedule and television channels is beginning to become an outdated concept now anyway. They will have to change soon and the BBC will too, actually. 

Absolutely - I can't think of any shows we reserve 7pm (say) to watch - which is why as the number of online-viewers grows, asserting that because you only watch online (or similar) is a very short-sighted and ultimately self-defeating outlook.

&gt;I don't need a justification for not paying the license fee.

Apparently you do, or this thread wouldn't exist.

&gt;It is not a mandatory tax.

I've already explained why 'I'm not breaking the law' isn't good enough on its' own.

&gt;I don't watch BBC programs. 

It's not just for you. And if we increase that to a number of people who like to say similar, they strangely tend to have seen stuff like Sherlock; that's the level of viewer you're lumping in with - it really is I-I-I to a silly, self-defeating degree.

&gt;This really is irrelevant

Only if you don't acknowledge the reddit/independent example. If the argument were that obvious, Sky wouldn't need to also offer the BBC channels.

&gt;Sky offers a broader array of content (albeit with advertisements) and the vast amounts of material available on the internet or through other services just outdoes the BBC on major scales of interest to me 

Ok;

* A science program better than Horizon
* A car show better than Top Gear
* An astronomy program better than Sky at Night
* A news quiz better than HIGNFY
* U.S Sherlock vs. UK Sherlock

And so on. You're also not mentioning the *average* quality of shows - it's not like upon getting Sky/ Cable the quality of programmes went up by any significant amount; quite the opposite.

And you keep reducing the 'everyone' argument to you - to the point that you've avoided addressing why it's better to pay for everyone *again*, despite my mentioning it twice in the previous post.

&gt;It isn't. Someone who wants to watch the BBC is welcome to buy into their services.

That first sentence contradicts the second one. Re-read the question.

&gt;Someone who thinks the BBC is swell is also welcome to buy into their services.

Which (again) is the argument put forwards by those that just can't understand why they should have to pay for others' healthcare.

&gt;Recall I only replied to you originally because you were condemning people for using the iPlayer and not paying the license fee. 

Because they use what is really a loophole to get a free lunch, and when challenged come up with really weak excuses and usually fall back on 'it's not illegal!'.

Lets not beat around the bush here. If any major power's espionage department want your data then you're likely not going to win.  

..... and I would trust a large cloud provider like AWS over the usual sharks that government IT projects are plagued with.

&gt; Whoever has your hardware hosting your instance and data has full access if it is to process locally.

Well one of the ISOs talk about physical access and AWS's ToCs stipulate that access to the servers are physically guarded by a security team. So we're back to the social engineering threat of an already authorised individual being manipulated.

All of the options pose risk. Going with an established cloud provider means that you gain access to an already well oiled machine as opposed to hosting everything yourself. The challenges there include physical access, hardware and hosting the VMs, staff training, connectivity, downtime, etc etc. There is a lot to deal with there and if an UK contractor makes the decision to go with a cloud provider then they're probably getting a better outcome than they would in trying to do it all themselves (considering how fucking awful most government IT projects are).

true,Skavau,null,null,"&gt;Not really - if a BBC equivalent had become apparent, there would be grounds for asking why we need to pay for the same via a license; but it doesn't really float anyway - all the others are a) not as good, b) do not provide radio and other services, and c) do not receive any of the fee, generating their income through ads (which is why the concept of charging and then showing ads anyway is a bit bizarre.

I am not sure you know what I am calling unfair. I am pointing out that ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5 etc are free services funded by advertisements. However they are de facto not free because you are required to have a TV License to watch Television in the UK. This is unfair to them as it could negatively impact on their audience base. If you watched their services through a TV you effectively need to subscribe in order to watch channels that would be otherwise free.

&gt;Generally, it is mandatory. If you own a TV capable of receiving BBC, that's usually it. Hence 98% of viewers pay for it.

But you don't have to own a television, thus it is not mandatory.

&gt;You mean like the Fire Service, Police force and NHS services I've never used? 

What a pathetic comparison. These are vital front-line services that have as their primary goal to save lives and prevent crime. Not comparable to an a television services. Individuals should not be compelled to fund entertainment services that they may have no interest in using.

&gt;What shall I do, complain that I'm paying for other people, or enjoy the fact that I get better content by paying for less?

You use the BBC and like the BBC. You presumably have a TV License. That's fine. Someone who does not want to watch television, or own a television or even use BBC services should not be compelled to pay a fee every year. They would not be interested in the ""better content by paying for less"" because they would never use the services.

&gt;You've (so far) asserted that an aggregate of the rest of the world provides a better overall service, which as pointed out is akin to insisting that reddit is better than the Independent,. so why does the latter need to exist.

I never said that the BBC should not exist. This is invoking an argument I never made.

&gt;Apparently you do, or this thread wouldn't exist.

I didn't start this thread. My participation in this thread also has nothing to do with me thinking I need to justify myself to you.

&gt; I've already explained why 'I'm not breaking the law' isn't good enough on its' own.

You've asserted that and applied ridiculous examples to make that point ignoring entirely why those things were criminalised at all. At any rate, I don't consume BBC content.

&gt;It's not just for you. And if we increase that to a number of people who like to say similar, they strangely tend to have seen stuff like Sherlock.

I haven't seen Sherlock. In addition, it isn't for me at all. There is no ethical reason for compelling each individual in Britain to pay into a media service that they may or may not be interested in watching. It is not comparable to the NHS, Fire Services or Police. At all.

&gt; A science program better than Horizon
&gt;A car show better than Top Gear
&gt;An astronomy program better than Sky at Night
&gt;A news quiz better than HIGNFY
&gt;U.S Sherlock vs. UK Sherlock

None of those things I watch, by the way. At any rate, the idea of a ""best"" show is considerably subjective. HIGNFY is great but really only resonates with British audiences. 

&gt;And so on. You're also not mentioning the average quality of shows - it's not like upon getting Sky/ Cable the quality of programmes went up by any significant amount; quite the opposite.

Perhaps, but the amount extra you get is considerable.

&gt;Which (again) is the argument put forwards by those that just can't understand why they should have to pay for others' healthcare.

That's their argument, not mine. I am not them. Funding Healthcare is a different thing entirely to funding through tax a media service.

&gt;Because they use what is really a loophole to get a free lunch, and when challenged come up with really weak excuses and usually fall back on 'it's not illegal!'. Sound familiar? :-)

A loophole is unintended. The iPlayer being free appears to be deliberate. Contact the BBC if this bothers you so much.

&gt;  The spokesman said: ""The relevant part of the Human Rights Act that affects information we release to the media as a CCTV appeal is the 'right to a fair trial'. 

&gt;  ""Dorset police do not ever state the person pictured in the CCTV image is the person we believe to have committed the crime because this can influence witnesses and maybe prejudice a trial. 

&gt;  And the police have made the task of putting a name to the man's concealed face even more difficult by failing to issue a description of him, leaving out key details such as his height, build and accent. 

What would listing his height, build and accent achieve? If someone recognised the person, be it recognising the balaclava or jacket, or perhaps knowing someone who was planning to do something similar in the area, they wouldn't need to know the description of the person, as they would already know who it is. Withholding this information is to stop people phoning in because Bob down the road is about that height, and has a similar sort of accent, and curtain twitcher Doris next door always thought he was a dodgy sort.

In terms of form, this is a very reliable option, but I'd rather Willian in the center, and Hazard on the wing, to be able to run free, and cause more damage. Willian drifts off to the left, while hazard just drifts to either wing. When Schurrle was playing, I don't remember Hazard invading the right wing too much though. 

ST: is the point where I'm absolutely torn by who to play. They're all bad in their own way, Eto'o seemingly a tad above Torres, who is a tad above Demba. 

Midfield is the one we change more frequently depending on the opposition. Matic seems like a staple back there, but Ramires moves up a lot, meaning Mikel/Luiz provide a different style. Mikel slows down play, while Luiz helps to feed the ball to the attackers, while also covering the defensive positions.

true,[deleted],null,null,"For a bit of flavour, I'm going to tell you to ignore everyone else here. I'm not saying this is the best decision, I'm just giving you a different side of things. 

If you want the Coupe, you get the Coupe.

First off; I think you mean the Hyundai Coupe S, not the S Coupe. The S is just the trim level (they also do SE), where an S Coupe is actually a different car produced in the 90s.

I'm very familiar with the Coupe, albeit the 2.0 model, and I can't rate it highly enough. It's good looking, extremely reliable, and fun to drive. It's not quick by any stretch of the imagination, but it does handle well. I've heard that the 1.6 is pretty sluggish, but that doesn't matter as it's your first car. It's still fun.

I will say however that the car is spectacularly impractical to get in and out of; the doors are very thick, which means you have to open them wide to get out, and you have to sort of exit behind you. The back seats are also tiny.

If you're getting hypothetical quotes of £1800, I'd say that's pretty good. You won't get much lower than that in your first year even if you do choose a little Fiat or something.

In my opinion, there's a lot to be said for paying a bit more for insurance if you're going to enjoy the car, especially when it's going to be pretty reliable. You have to weigh up how much extra it's going to cost you and if it's worth it for your own personal enjoyment.

Don't be one of those people who buys a shed, and spends £500 on a bodykit and fatboy exhaust when they could have just spent a few hundred more on insurance for a better car.

My first car was a 1.6 Volvo S40. When I bought it, my friends thought I was mad - compared to their 1.0 Corsas, it was a huge and extravagant beast with a massive engine. Looking back on it now, it was a small and gutless saloon, but it fared me very well indeed. I specifically remember that it cost me the same as two of my friends' cars - a Punto and a Matiz. I spent about £200 more on insurance than they did, but at the end of the first year, I was far better off after they'd forked out hundreds to keep their cars running.

Again, take this with a pinch of salt. I'm not a practical car buyer. I've never spent less than £1500 on insurance in my five years of driving, but I have never ever regretted it.

**TL;DR: Be willing to spend more on insurance if it means you're getting a better car and might save money / enjoy yourself more.**

Benfica couldn't penetrate our defense, even though our defense was sleeping. I can't imagine they'd do better against Rose/Vert/Kaboul/Walker. I think they'll struggle for goals and, as long as Sandro is fit and can close down the area in front of the back four, may not score during the tie. 

In all honesty, we probably have the easiest run in of the final 16. Sure, others may say Anji, Ludogorets or Plzen might be easier but I disagree. Benfica is an underperforming team that can't get it together it seems (or the last tie showed) while Plzen and Ludogorets are really riding an emotional rollercoaster, and we rarely do well against teams like that.

I say we have a pretty favorable tie and as long as we put a strong showing at home we can take a half-strength side to Portugal and play a defensive match. They won't be able to break us down and I'm confident we can pass to the final 8.

My anxiety of people letting me down or getting rid of me means that I often avoid making friends and I find myself feeling worthless and lonely.

&gt;

&gt;**Three Men in a Boat** is a television comedy/documentary series produced by Liberty Bell Productions for [BBC Two](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Two) starring [Dara Ó Briain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dara_%C3%93_Briain), [Rory McGrath](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McGrath) and [Griff Rhys Jones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griff_Rhys_Jones), first shown on 3 January 2006. In this first rendition, the three participants rowed in a replica wooden [skiff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skiff) from [Kingston upon Thames](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston_upon_Thames) to [Oxford](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford). 

&gt;The BBC subsequently commissioned and aired Three Men in Another Boat,  Three Men in More Than One Boat,  Three Men go to Ireland,  Three Men go to Scotland;  Three Men go to Venice, and Three Men go to New England, broadcast in 2008, 2009, 2009/2010, 2010 and 2011 respectively. Every series, bar the first, has featured the music from the Pirates of the Caribbean film series. In late October 2011, a production team was shooting in [Provincetown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provincetown), Massachusetts, America's oldest art colony, at the tip of [Cape Cod](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Cod).

true,amgoingtohell,lfc12,,"Reading the comments here about nationality and Northern Ireland. Let's nip this in the bud. 

Firstly, rather than seeing diversity in nationality as a negative thing as often happens in Northern Ireland it should be seen as positive. 

People living in that part of the island of Ireland are in a unique position. 

They get to be either Irish citizens or UK citizens or both - seeing as people there can hold dual nationality and both a UK and Irish passport. People have a right to refer to themselves as Irish, British/UK citizen, Northern Irish, Ulster-Scots or whatever floats their boat. Who cares really?

Lets not drag Brendan Rodgers into some petty argument about nationality - I doubt he or any true Reds fan wants that. 

The headline could have been: 

""Liverpool's Brendan Rodgers an inspiration to a new breed of UK managers""

or simply:

""Liverpool's Brendan Rodgers an inspiration to a new breed of managers""

... but it isn't 'wrong'. End of the day - Rodgers could be Italian for fucks sakes and still be an inspiration to British managers.

People here moaning about it are being over sensitive. It's not like it said 'British manager Brendan Rodgers...' They call him Northern Irishman. Regardless of politics he is definitely from the northern part of the island of Ireland.

So fuck it. Who cares? He is a fucking amazing manager and most importantly - he is our manager. Lets be happy about it and not worry about some petty label. We are all united by the fact that we are Liverpool fans regardless of where we live.

Final thoughts (read in the voice of Jerry Springer): Remember folks, nationalism a double-edged sword. It both emboldens the blood, just as it narrows the mind. 'Til next time - take care of yourselves and each other.

I mean if we want to start picking holes in things we could also say that they make an error when they say British Isles and Ireland - instead of Britain and Ireland. The island of Ireland is included in term 'British Isles' - a geographical (not political) term to describe the Atlantic Archipelago.

&gt;[Following recent concerns regarding our access to HES data and its use in P2 People &amp; Places, we would like to clarify that we have never had direct access to the raw HES data. The NWPHO carried out the analysis on our behalf.](http://www.beacon-dodsworth.co.uk/site/data/hospital-episode-statistics/)

And:

&gt;[The NWPHO scanned four years of individual HES data records allocating to each record one of 41 codes that gave its P² group (e.g. J30 Council Terraces: Lone-parent family; Protestant religion; Rent property from council;Unemployed; Have limiting long-term illness). The NWPHO looked at 14 diseases to find the rate of disease for each P² group. This enabled Beacon Dodsworth to draw disease maps and do other analysis without encountering privacy issues. For each disease we had 41 numbers from which it is impossible to track down an individual case. Removing all identifying information such as name, address, postcode etc and replacing these with a geodemographic coding, results in significantly valuable data sets that can be widely distributed without invading privacy](http://www.beacon-dodsworth.co.uk/blog/general-news/set-our-data-free-an-open-letter-to-the-secretary-of-state-for-health/). 

So Beacon Dodsworth had no access to identifiers or health records. Merely a series of disease rates according to a number of pre-defined geo-demographic categories. These disease rates were then applied to maps according to data from a range of different surveys, which indicate the probable locations of each P² group.


**Update from the HSCIC, 04/03/2014:**

Confirmed:

&gt;[We would like to make clear that information given to Beacon Dodsworth by NW PHO was anonymous, aggregate level analysis, which was used to look at disease prevalence in different communities. No record level data was shared with Beacon Dodsworth, nor was any of this information sensitive or at patient level.](http://www.hscic.gov.uk/article/3951/Statement-Use-of-data-by-former-North-West-Public-Health-Observatory-and-Beacon-Dodsworth)",0,1393883064,null,0,1393952413,0,cftjaen,t3_1zgtn8,t1_cftjaen,t3_1zgtn8,null,1432643247,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

This has allowed us to be orders of magnitude more productive in agriculture, manufacturing and other industries. The level of work needed to sustain a comfortable lifestyle is probably only a tiny fraction of what actually occurs. You talk of a 4 day week, I would argue that we could theoretically survive comfortably on even a one or two day week.

One of the problems is that this is not the road we have ever taken. Increases in productivity very seldom result in fewer working hours for the workers, but in increased production, artificially inflated demand, and (crucially) inflated profits for owners and investors.

The level of income of the top fraction of society is the only thing that has benefited from our gains in productivity, and we need constant growth and increases in productivity to sustain the capitalist class in these lifestyles to which they've become accustomed.

That's the only reason why we work so much, and without it we could all work much less for the same or similar standard of living - with a lot more time to enjoy it.

There'd also be no need for unemployment. I'd argue that there's no need for unemployment now, other than as a tool to erode worker's rights and drive down wages.

true,Aygers,lfc99,,"There is possibly another reason. In another article posted on the sub, we've seen Rodgers introducing the (arguably) seventh different tactical setup at the beginning of the match. This says to me that Rodgers prepares a plan he believes is the best approach toward winning a game and then proceeds to stick with it for a variety of reasons, most of which the author of the article stated.

Given Rodgers has been the manager of Liverpool for about a year and a half, I think we can asses his character in this job at this point. First thing that springs to my mind is calm, the next is decisive. There's others as well, but that's not what we're here for. My point is this, BR is a man who rarely second guesses himself. Of course we've had occasions where that worked against him, but this season, the majority of matches, his approach worked well. Last season less so.

Rodgers has made a step forward as a manager this season. I think we can all agree on that. Previous season he tried many things and it seems he learned a lot from it. I find that to be incredibly admirable and useful trait. If he continues to evaluate his approach and adapt it according to what he's learned during the previous season, he can turn into a great manager indeed.

While I agree there are very important and accurate facts listed as to why BR's subs don't score a lot of goals (the biggest one for me is, he tends to play his best team right from the start and keeps faith with them), I would also like to argue, his pre-match preparation and tactics setup play a very prominent role in why the subs don't score as often. 

At this point I am very interested in two things:
1) how often in this season, or in both seasons, Rodgers adapted his starting plan in the course of a match
2) how will Champions League qualification and subsequently bigger squad affect him as a manager

Point two is impossible to discuss, because we'll just have to wait and see. However it will be a big test for him as a manager, as he is likely to posses a considerably better squad next season.",0,1393885499,null,0,false,0,cftkgvm,t3_1zgibz,t1_cftkgvm,t3_1zgibz,null,1432643805,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

true,kittenpyjamas,eng-hampshire,Hampshire - Living in the midlands,"People deride this kind of article as being utterly wrong when it's not. 

Social and cultural capital are real concepts which exist.

Just a warning, I am going to generalise, but the point stands.

When you have a child from a working class background, they don't have the opportunities a child from a middle class background has. A working class child won't be taken to the theatre, they won't be taken to museums, they're less likely to be read to at home when they're young and are less likely to have access to books. They're at a disadvantage compared to little Timmy who went to the science museum last week and has been exposed to Shakespeare before secondary school. This is cultural capital, and if you lack cultural capital you are less likely to be able to get on in our generally middle class society. 

Social capital is the working class mum and dad not being able to get their child into the nice school in the area because they aren't in catchment. Little Timmy's parents wanted him to go to this school desperately and so using their social connections they played the system. They moved house when little Timmy was very small so he would have an address inside the catchment area.

Here's what the processed loaf contains: wholemeal flour, water, yeast, spirit vinegar, salt (significantly more), vegetable oil (rapeseed and palm oil, the latter of which is very bad for you), wheat protein, soya flour, emulsifiers (mono- and diacetyl tartaric esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids - vegetable), and a flour treatment agent (ascorbic acid).  Now that's not a particularly egregious example - it's not as cheap and nasty as some.  But even here, largely because of the Chorleywood process which is now used to make about 80% of our bread, more unnecessary stuff is added, including much more salt than you would use to make bread yourself (about 8 grams in a standard loaf).

The comedy that makes it to network broadcast, ad supported, prime time television is going to be generic, feel-good, and unoffensive (almost aggressively so) by design.  Stray from the beaten path a bit, even to basic cable comedies, and things like Jeremy eating the dog (one of the funniest moments in the series, imo) are more common.

That having been said, as an American, I definitely see a difference in tone between British and American humor (humour?), with American tending toward the goofy/heartwarming, and British to the acerbic/sarcastic.  [This video here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k2AbqTBxao) has Stephen Fry articulating some of the differences quite well.  It only works in broad strokes though, because I find Russell Howard to be incredibly goofy, cheerful, and optimistic, and Lewis Black to be angry, spiteful, and pessimistic.

It's not exactly new territory, American optimism vs. British pessimism is one of the more defining differences between our cultures. Or at least, it's the go-to difference for all those arm-chair sociologist out there.

It's that risk of if they do have it, given or taken, then where will they stop? Potentially just Crimea, but it sets a precedent that we won't intervene and that they're able to do it, so it's that balance of avoiding military intervention while also ensuring that they don't go any further - can't go any further - if they do have it.

true,kmarti33,lfc99,,"Well probably starting with the ManU game in 2 weeks will will have 7 midfielders/wingers/forwards for 4 spots: Gerrard, Henderson, Allen, Sterling, Lucas, Coutinho, and Aspas(Moses if you are desperate).  I would say in most of our games Coutinho and Sterling (sometimes Gerrard and Henderson) are visibly tired/worn out after 60 minutes.  This leads to missed 50/50 chances, breakaways and poor passing.  Granted out midfield isn't know for finishing chances, its not like they don't get opportunities though.

Now to your question, if one of our forwards is being locked down, wornout, slightly injured or frustrated, it can lead to bad decisions and missed opportunities.  Which is why Sturridge gets subbed out sometimes.  When this happens to strikers they try to force the issue a lot and try to do everything themselves which leads to missed opportunities for other players and usually a lot of long range shots that miss badly.

Yes when healthy and fresh our attack is amazing, but every starter doesn't necessarily play their best every game.  When that happens we shouldn't be afraid to utilize our bench.  I mean look what happened in the last 2 games when we introduced subs, Allen and Sterling made tremendous impacts on the game especially offensively.  Going forward we will have 3 of the 7 players mentioned above on the bench available to be subs.  Besides Suarez I would say any of our starting attack at 70% or less is not necessarily a better option than a fresh sub.  Our attack is so fast paced that the players don't get much chance to rest especially if they are also pressing as much as possible.

I was asked to go to an interview in my local city for an environmental care position, almost guaranteed work, I thought brilliant! Turns out it was cleaning graffiti off the streets for no more than the JSA was paying me anyway. Did I take it? Did I fuck. I told them that with this work I would be worse off due to having to pay for travel, they told me they would pay (on a side note don't believe this as they don't always actually do it). I told them I would be worse off due to having to pay for extras (food, work goods, clothes), they told me these were normal things everyone has to pay for. Then I told them I refuse to work 30 hours a week doing the work given to convicts for considerably less than what this county has, by law, decided is the very minimum we pay people for a service. I told them it was disgusting to allow companies to pressure the countries most desperate people into working for pittance because they want to get cheap staff, and how such practices will simple demoralize a generation. Luckily my advisor completely agreed and he pulled me off it, but I know other people weren't so lucky. 

The sad reality is even if every job is filled tomorrow there will still be more than half of claimants claiming. The stigma around being unemployed can be horrible but don't let it make you feel like you don't have a choice, because you do, and someone in a different position doesn't have the right to judge you when you are trying, and they are bad for doing so. The minimum wage is a law, it was decided that is what you deserve for work, you should not take ANY job for less than that, and to do so will only benefit the company you are being used by.

Work will come along, make sure you cover your back and do everything they ask within reason, keep records and try to save every penny you don't need to spend.

And if it stops at Crimea they might just get away with it, there's another precedent here though; Russia using military force to get what they want, and using it to secure a very key naval base that could enable them to do more of the same in places further away from their borders.

There's also the manufacturing side of oil to consider - I mean look around you, virtually everything we use is made from or by hydrocarbons, our society itself is built on hydrocarbons - there's no renewable source at present that comes anywhere near to replacing that. Not even close. 

We can't grow it and we certainly can't synthesise anywhere near the amount we consume.  And besides that any process to synthesise an oil replacement would need oil itself for the manufacturing process, same with the manufacturing process for any kind of renewable power source.

- I don't think government funded selective faith schools should be a thing at all. I don't think that's what we give our taxes to the government for.

- I think it would be impossible and immoral to ban private selective faith schools. Parents have a right to choose what they think is the best education for their children. However, every private school I know of has a charitable status on the basis of community benefit - they take in some students for free or at a reduced rate. This should not be given to schools which select students based on religion (apart from extra curricular ones such as Saturday schools and evening classes).

- Religious and cultural studies should be obligatory in all schools up to a certain level, and this should cover all major religions and cultures in reasonable detail.

Let's NATO intervenes the public in Western Europe and North America probably won't like it. Nations bordering Belarus, Ukraine and Russia have a lot to lose and will probably push for NATO/EU to show some power. Elections are coming up in Europe for the EU Parliament and in a year or two most will be voting for national governments no one is going to risk doing some thing unpopular and intervention in foreign lands aren't popular. Most the wars Russia has fought in ex soviet states are in a frozen state even the ones it didn't fight in Armenia/Azerbaijan.

I didn't say ban private faith schools and I don't think that they should be banned.  Although I do still think that they are a sick idea.  
Stopping using tax payers money to make new (state run) faith schools would be a start, and the (gradual - never ever attack religion (unless you want to promote it)) desegragation of current state run faith schools. 

&gt; Religious and cultural studies should be obligatory in all schools up to a certain level, and this should cover all major religions and cultures in reasonable detail.

Exactly. I'm with you and Dennett on this one. 

&gt; I don't think we need to abolish faith schools at all, we just need to offer them no room to radicalize or secularize children.

I presume you meant to say 'segragate childen', if so - then that is exactly my problem with the whole faith school project started by Blair and continued by the coalition.  Faith schools segragate.  What kids are taught in class matters but routinely meeting, playing, socialising with kids of other religions and cultures is more real and informative in many ways.   I live in London and really like it here, I like the people the diversity and the creativity that comes about where you have a melting pot where cultures mix.  This whole 'multiculturalism' bullshit is divisive and dangerous and incredibly unfair - how dare the government collude with conservative 'community leaders' to pigeon hole people within the brackets of defined cultures - pretty much at birth.  Culture is not static, it's organic, it evolves - leave people alone and they find their own way.  When you try and control it and build barriers (like segragation) tensions, contradictions and misconceptions build - it's dangerous.  I can't decide whether or not it's some clever and cynical right wing ploy to divide and control or utter utter moronic arrogance on the left (probably the latter).

&gt; Parents have a right to choose what they think is the best education for their children.

True, the rights of parents are very important.  But the larger impact on society and community relations also matters - it's a balance but I'd rather my tax was spent in a way that does not discourage community cohesion.

Those CL home games under Rafa were as close as we've been to reliving them. We're were genuinely one of the best sides in Europe and you had the sense that we could take on anyone. It was recapturing a bit of that magic that had made us kings of Europe and it felt good.

 I used to go the game quite regularly, and to be honest if you gave me a list of league fixtures I probably struggle to tell you which ones I'd been to. But I could tell you all about the European games, which stand I was in, who scored etc, they're burned into my mind.

On the other end of the emotional scale, I was there to see us dumped out as defending champions by Benfica, where I cried during a defiant full time rendition of YNWA. I'd never been so gutted as I was seeing us getting knocked out at Anfield as Champions.

It was the only time I've cried over football and it was in large part down to the highly charged and emotional atmosphere that Anfield has on European nights.

true,darmani11,IQ,iraq,"Go back and re-watch goal 1. Torres would've been clear on goal if Schürrle decided to pass it up to Torres, instead of his 1-2 with Hazard.

Once the ball was with hazard, hazard kept it for a moment, wasting Torres' run, but opening up Schürrle's run. If hazard instantly passed it up, Torres would've been behind the defenders, with Schürrle to his aid, making the best of both runs.

Had Hazard or Schürrle sent it over to Torres, it would of meant Oscar, Torres, and Schürrle would've been in front of goal, with only 2 defenders covering.

Not only that, but the run confused the back line. They were all crumpled up together, but no one marking anyone in specific.

Brilliant attempted play by Torres I say.

**64' Schürrle's Goal #2**

Torres' run following his failed through-ball to Schürrle was put to a stop when Eden was challenged by a defender, after Oscar had salvaged the ball.

Torres managed to keep on side this time, but slowed to a walk, after noticing the play was going to start on the other side. As soon as Schürrle got the ball, he bursts into a sprint, providing support to Schürrle, but it remained a difficult ball to play for Schürrle, so he did well to finish it, instead of attempting to get it to Torres. 

** past 65'** Fulham played extremely open. 2 opportunities were wasted, as Schürrle's selfishness for the goal to complete his hat trick meant he took unreasonable chances. Both in which passing it, would've granted a better opportunity. 

The contribution of Torres in the third goal is blatantly obvious, and both of you already touched on it.

Final note, I felt there was more good play by Torres in the first half, but I'm too lazy to watch the first half a third time. My second watch through it, I noticed that contrary to what you said of him drifting off to the wings, he was very central. The only time he drifted off to one side was when play was on that side, and that is to be expected.",0,1393897654,null,0,false,0,cftq1z2,t3_1zcj1i,t1_cftq1z2,t1_cfsmf60,null,1432646436,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

When the youngest got to be 13 he asked me to unblock it. 

As for my girl, my SO is incharge of that. This is really the best way since I not only know that they understand porn isn't real but I know that they are consuming stuff with a channel I have provided. They have no reason to go look elsewhere. And when they have they have talked to me about it.

It's also allowed me to be the cool Dad. They have come to not just me but their Mom a couple of times with issues I would to this day not approach my parents with. I feel this is one of many reasons why.

Kind of don't understand how people apparently can't see the massive inconsistency in ""We posted losses of £50m this year but we now owe less money!!"". If we were under someone like Abramovic, then these losses can continue (FIFA FFP aside), but FSG don't seem like the kind of group that will be happy to bankroll £50m losses year on year.

That said, the fact is that FSG know the figures and the long term plans, and presumably they've got some strategy for putting us back in the black again. That I can't see FSG happy to be consistently bankrolling those kinds of losses, yet they seem perfectly happy to retain ownership at the club would suggest to me that things aren't so bad. 

I also think it's worth noting that 2012-13 was the tail end of one of the worst periods for the club, and at the very least I'd expect the figures for 2013-14 to be substantially better.

The one redeeming thing about the figures published would be that about £48m of our outgoings relate to old player sales (under FFP transfer fees have to be distributed across the length of the original player contract in the financials), so a good chunk of that loss is tied up in big purchases like Suarez, Carroll, Downing, Adam, etc that we're still having to put on the books, and kind of make these things hard to judge in an individual year. 

I don't know if that figure will necessarily go down over the next few years as I expect we'll strengthen the squad, but it's at least less worrying when losses can be attributed to what's basically capital expenditure in new players.
