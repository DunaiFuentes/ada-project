true,strolls,null,null,"You could probably win a court case on the strength of emails, but the question is whether it's really beneficial to do so.

The landlord is under no obligation to continue renting to you - not past the end of your contract, anyway.

So - guessing that you have a 6 month contract and that you've been there a few weeks already - you could easily find yourself receiving notice to quit in another few weeks time, looking for new flats again, irrespective of whether or not you're in the right (morally or legally).

IMO this question hinges upon how reasonable the bloke is and how amicable you can be.

If you're both employed and expecting to stay there a while then I think he should want to accommodate you, but my experience of landlords is that they're often short-termists who're only interested in what they *need* to spend *right now*.

If you're gonna win him over, you need to be super, *super* reasonable - remember that he doesn't have to do it (a court case might win you a couple of hundred quid) but he should want to do it because it's what you've been promised. You need to persuade him that he should want to be fair with you and make you happy because you're going to have a long relationship and because you're going to be looking after his property for years to come.

If you allow him to perceive you as a shrill complainer, then you might as well just start looking for a new place now.

Finally, just let me say that I think this is all completely unfair, and that you shouldn't have to fight to get what's promised to you.

We grew up during the Wild West days of the internet. As it grows larger and more influential, it's is going to be legislated more. 

A physical store can't sell a porn DVD to an underage customer. Legally they have to check ID and verify their age. Clearly parents have a responsibility to stop their kid going into adult movie stores but the internet has always been a bit of a loophole to this where we put responsibility 100% onto the parents and kids and not the vendor. 

Same applies to plenty of things apart from porn. We are seeing it with occasional prosecution for calling people nasty names on twitter. As the internet becomes a bigger part of real life, we will have to start applying more 'real life' laws to it. If I call someone a stupid nigger to their face, I could probably get arrested. So if I do it on Facebook or a web forum, there's actually no reason it SHOULD be different - it's just that historically we are used to that behaviour online being seen as different to face to face.

I suppose the plan from BR is for Migs to pass it to Sakho/Agger, who then distributes it to either Gerrard or the fullbacks.


I think he's a great keeper and I'd rather see us invest in a great coach for him, rather than a new goalie.

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt;  it seems like an awful waste of a landlord's money (and mine in extra rent) to have an agency that literally only takes money and, presumably, deals with overdue rent. 

Agencies will often charge different rates for difference services - just finding and auditing tenants will be cheaper than also organising maintenance contractors &amp;c.

&gt; It felt a bit like they'd found tenants, job done, washed their hands of us from that point on.

I was going to reply elsewhere, but here is as good as anywhere - in general, and unfortunately, agencies can afford to be this way.

The main constraint against which agencies operate is landlords, not tenants. 

It is the number of landlords an agency has that determines their income, primarily.

Vetting tenants, collecting money and dealing with maintenance and legal issues is something that anyone can do. Sure, there's a skill to it, but they're skills that most anyone can learn, and there is always another lettings agency who are happy to make promises and steal your clients (landlords) away from you.

Finding tenants, especially good ones, isn't a walk in the park, but agencies are practised at it. Most of the time, if they can't find a good tenant for a property they wait a bit longer and one will turn up. Then they just sit there and the money comes in, usually for at least years at a time.

Obviously if they wait too long to find the right tenant, they risk pissing the landlord off, and that's the important thing, as far as agencies are concerned - at any time the landlord can take his ball and go play with someone else. 

So an agency's primary concern is keeping the landlords happy, not the tenants.

If they find another landlord, they make more money, if they lose a landlord they make less.

Finding more tenants, or keeping tenants happy, doesn't generate more revenue, once all their properties are filled.

It's probably more hassle for you to move than it is for agencies to find another tenant. It's certainly harder to find landlords than tenants.

There are some quite decent agencies out there, and there are some really nice people out there who work for lettings agencies, but unfortunately, that doesn't mean much.

There are some awful landlords out there, and when a landlord throws a fit because he doesn't want to make some reasonable expenditure, there's not much the staff at the agency can do. You can be as nice and reasonable as you like, and they can make whatever promises they like, but if the agency can't persuade the landlord to treat you fairly then there's nothing to be done about it. 

Agencies have no sanction against bad landlords except refusing their money, and generally this would be something that falls only to the boss, not to the staff who have to deal with the bad landlord every day.

If you have debts that are racking up interest then pay them off FIRST. Borrowing money is expensive and puts you at risk. Make sure you stay out of debt as much as possible.

I had a similar situation and set up a S&amp;S ISA with Charles Stanley Direct. For long term a cash ISA is not the way to go.

I bought the Vanguard Lifestrategy fund (80% Acc in my case as I'm looking at a longer timescale). Essentially you get a complete low cost portfolio in a single fund. You can read about the different versions here:

https://www.vanguard.co.uk/uk/portal/investments/about-our-products#lifestrategy-funds

The PDFs on that page have a good summary of the standard investment concepts If you're talking about holding for 5-10 years, probably the 40% or 60% version is most suitable. Each % fund is available in Income or Accumulation forms, you will probably want the Accumulation version. The BlackRock Consensus funds are similar but with greater fees.

You should really read up on the basics (https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/categories/saving-and-investing for starters). It's important to know how this stuff works and what risks you are taking.

EDIT: And their opposition equivalents.

Conservatives are Tories

Labour are...just Labour, they used to be unofficially called New Labour, but this was a marketing move to signify a move towards the political centre from their leftwing origins. 

Liberal Democrats get shortened to LibDems.

David Cameron is usually referred to as Dave. 

The Employment Minister Iain Duncan Smith is shortened to IDS.

The problem with current UK politicians is that very few of them have prominent enough personalities to warrant a nickname. We usually simply refer to them by their names.

You might want to throw London Mayor Boris Johnson into your research. He's very vocal, very opinionated and one of the few truly unique characters left on the current British political landscape.

Also, you should be looking at UKIP (The UK Independance Party). They have a smattering of European Parliament seats, but none at home. They're well positioned to make an impact on next years' General Election, but mostly because of the country's disillusionment with the main parties and the utter disaster that has been the Conservative/LibDem coalition.

Honestly, with an inquisitive mind like you appear to have, you will learn quickly to identify the BS (of which there is plenty in politics) and it will become fun laughing at some of the more inane promises and speeches which you come across. Treat it as a game of detective; it's really very enjoyable!

I work in social media so how you're using Twitter is more professional curiosity on my part. 

You should probably include Alex Salmond http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Salmond and Nigel Farage http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Farage

As the Scottish independence referendum is coming up soon and Alex Salmond is leader of the SNP you'll probably see him pop up a fair bit. 

Nigel Farage is the leader of UKIP who are gaining a lot of media coverage and are chipping away at the Tories' right wing vote. 

The UK has seen massive decline in party membership and general interest in political parties, our media tends to focus more on ministers and MPs who either create a scandal or are more vocal than most.  

I might be a tad optimistic here but I think you'll see people talking more about issues than about politicians. 

You should certainly include George Osborne as the chancellor he'll certainly pop up more than most.  

Really slang wise aside from a few characters who have stood out most politicians aren't well known enough to be referred to by anything other than their name or a derogatory term depending how people feel about their party.

Why is this about difficulty?  So everyone has the capacity to become a doctor and anyone who chooses not to be is simply opting to take an ""simpler"" path through life?

Which is a fallacy, so-and-so still has a mother and a father, however remote they may be.

&gt; Just something so that kids hopefully don't grow up bullying others for having two dads, etc.

That may be the stated goal. I believe the true reason for going after young kids is more in line with trying to remove the uncomfortable edge in being homosexual by teaching them that it's perfectly normal.

Kind of like this current post where the guys says ""If everybody failed physics, then nobody fails."" Similarly, if everybody loses the notion of a normal sexuality then being homosexual may feel more ""normal"". Which is a quite common behavior, e.g, ""if we persuade ourselves that everybody do drugs, then we may feel less bad about doing drugs."" This attempts are bound to fail obviously, still people do that all the time.

The ""bullying kid"" that's mocking them because they're homosexuals really only exists in their own minds, basically they're trying to fix their internal psychological conflicts by changing the world, in a classical neurotic pattern.

Kids are not a social experimentation playground. Do whatever you want in your own privacy, I have no issues with that whatsoever. Only leave them kids alone.",0,1398016547,null,0,false,0,cgxflot,t3_23i10e,t1_cgxflot,t1_cgxanuo,null,1433441520,-5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-5

Do you click on the Suarez dive vine and then go the comments expecting something and then dont see it and are upset? Like what does that have to do with Chelsea at all? You're upset because Jose rubs people the wrong way and as soon as he chokes in one of the biggest games and throws everyone else BESIDES himself under the bus people react. 

It's not a fucking circlejerk, its people realizing that look, Suarez isn't the spawn of Satan everyone makes him out to be (before the season he might as well have been hitler) and they are realizing that you have been lucky enough to witness one of the GREATEST seasons from a striker in a long time. 

Stop expecting everyone to be lovey dovey towards you club when frankly your leader doesnt deserve it. Dont go to /r/soccer expecting everyone to have your idea and believe what you believe.

It's so rare to see a Chelsea supporter just man up and say you know what? Mourinho wasnt good enough today. So when people visit /r/chelseafc (dont tell us to fuck off, its a free world we like to see you guys panic) and they see multiple threads/comments berating the ref, and then a thread applauding Jose, we get an idea that you're all whiny brats. THATS how a circlejerk starts. 

TL;DR: Grow a pair of balls, stop expecting everyone to agree with you and accept your club and Jose aren't infallible. Liverpool, City, and Arsenal players all get criticised like everyone else.

They were giving the kids books and holding class talks saying that evolution is wrong and that they should give themselves to jesus and all that psycho patter nonsense.

No we weren't, stop trying to change the subject. This entire thread is about the supposed harm caused by the presence of Muslims. 

Besides, most of Buddhism is nonsensical. It was anti-science for 1000 years, you think it's a coincidence that practically zero human achievement came out of that part of the world? Buddhists believe that the world is an illusion and that trying to make sense of it through science and reason is subservient behaviour.

&gt; Buddhism was the first religion to teach respect towards one's wive

Bullshit, there are many paganistic beliefs pre-dating it by millennia, some of them were even placed women as more important than men.

Also, such ""respect"" was of the kind of respect you have for your animals, it was not anything remotely resembling equality.

&gt; not all branches and teaching of Buddhism say that a woman can't achieve enlightenment

80% by followers do.

&gt; please read deeper than the wikipedia page.

The wiki page on Buddhism is a whitewash written by stoned hippies who only pick up on the new age crap and don't actually understand it. They even argue that Buddhism is pro-science which is completely backwards to the belief's fundamental concepts.

&gt; At least they don't stone rape victims to death or circumcise newborns. Really, you are embarrassing yourself.

Actually, they do stone people, particularly child sex slaves who try to escape. There was a formal order of punishments ranging from mutilation, bone breaking, stoning and eye gouging.

I'm just going to go ahead and edit your comment to what is actually relevant to mine:

&gt; Why does that bother you? I dont understand. Do you click on the Suarez dive vine and then go the comments expecting something and then dont see it and are upset? ~~Like what does that have to do with Chelsea at all? You're upset because Jose rubs people the wrong way and as soon as he chokes in one of the biggest games and throws everyone else BESIDES himself under the bus people react.~~

&gt; It's not a fucking circlejerk, its people realizing that look, Suarez isn't the spawn of Satan everyone makes him out to be (before the season he might as well have been hitler) and they are realizing that you have been lucky enough to witness one of the GREATEST seasons from a striker in a long time.

&gt; ~~Stop expecting everyone to be lovey dovey towards you club when frankly your leader doesnt deserve it. Dont go to [1] /r/soccer expecting everyone to have your idea and believe what you believe.~~

&gt; ~~It's so rare to see a Chelsea supporter just man up and say you know what? Mourinho wasnt good enough today. So when people visit [2] /r/chelseafc (dont tell us to fuck off, its a free world we like to see you guys panic) and they see multiple threads/comments berating the ref, and then a thread applauding Jose, we get an idea that you're all whiny brats. THATS how a circlejerk starts.~~

&gt; ~~TL;DR: Grow a pair of balls, stop expecting everyone to agree with you and accept your club and Jose are infallible. Liverpool, City, and Arsenal players all get criticised like everyone else. But god forbid Jose gets criticised or we're circlejerking against Chelsea.~~

It doesn't really bother me, I just kind of see it and roll my eyes. It's not a big deal, just /r/soccer. Not sure what Suarez having an incredible season has to do with it though? I actually thought it was quite funny - the transition between rolling around and starting to sprint was so fast it was pretty comical. It's not some grand slandering of Suarez, though some would probably want it to be. The thread was filled with people passionately defending him - such a contrast to the popular opinion in previous seasons. The contrast is interesting, and shows how public opinion can swing.

You can call it a circlejerk because all the top comments were saying the same, with the dissenting voices being buried. Only one opinion was being heard = circlejerk. But like I say, it's not really a big deal. /r/soccer has been a Liverpool love-in for the past couple of weeks, I think this is fairly undeniable, but next time Suarez goes psycho on someone that will probably change.

Spanish has a lexical similarity of .89 to Portuguese while English has a lexical similarity of .60 to German ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_similarity#Indo-European_languages)).

Having a look at a/the/one definition:

&gt; [Bigot: A person who is obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices; especially :  one who regards or treats the members of a group (as a racial or ethnic group) with hatred and intolerance.](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bigot)

Let's say that the lady in question was asked to read a book to a group of kids, and then found out that the book was about a little girl who had two daddies. She then refuses to read the book because her religious beliefs dictate that the gay lifestyle (let's ignore that term for the moment) is morally wrong, and it is her conviction that children should not be taught about it in any positive sense.

I think I've described the situation fairly and not just to be able to make this following point. If you disagree, or can describe it more neutrally then let me know? But with this hypothetical: Is that not, then, ""obstinately devoted to her own opinions (and prejudices)"" in so far as she will not even read a book about such people to the children? Given the general acceptance of homosexuality, and given that some of the kids in such a class may turn out to be gay, why should the general public allow someone to manifest their intolerance? 

edit: I understand the point you're making in so far as ""Someone should not be forced to read a book about a gay couple if they don't like gays"" and I think I can agree with it. In this sense, then, the correct course of action is to dismiss that person because they cannot live up to the contract they signed - I'm pretty certain that she signed up agreeing to promote equality of everyone regardless of race, religion etc. She's not being forced to read a book, but she's being dismissed for refusing to uphold her end of the contract.

&gt;  It'd be close minded to instantly dismiss another opinion as some sort of backward thinking.

True, but she is not employed to have a particular opinion, or should I say she doesn't have the right to exercise the manifestation of that particular opinion, in front of children.

That's not going to work, obviously. Slagging off Chelsea fans in a subreddit explicitly for Chelsea discussion is a bit rich don't you think? 

&gt; Mourinho wasnt good enough today. 

Mourinho wasn't playing (yes)today. He reserves the right to claim that the ref had a bad game. Mike Dean objectively had a bad game. You lot seem to care a lot about what Mourinho has to say, and ignore the fact that Brendan has done the exact same thing earlier in this season. Fucking. Hypocrites. 

We don't want anyone, least of all liverpool fans to be lovey dovey towards us. We do want to be able to have a constructive discussion about football, which we unfortunately cannot have in the liverpool love-in that is r/soccer right now. This is our only sanctuary, and it's turning into a bit of a troll-fest, which is annoying. 

&gt; Suarez

He's not the spawn of satan, but he has offended Chelsea fans by being a fucking prat, biting ivanovic and staying on the pitch, scoring the equaliser in the 98th minute, and with countless other actions. 
He clearly doesn't have the same respect for the game than other players do. Don't get me wrong, I wish Ramires wouldn't dive or elbow players, but I'm not asking anyone to like him. So stop trying to get other team's fans to like Suarez. It's not going to happen. Him being good at football does not negate my opinion of him as a fucking scumbag who is not sporting and prides winning over everything. I know plenty of dicks that are good at football. Do I have to like them? No. 

Claiming that we're 'lucky' to witness Suarez in our prime is beyond inane. You're WELCOME for Drogba then. You're LUCKY to have been alive at the same time as Zola, Hazard, Lampard, and Terry. You're welcome. You should be thanking us for our club blessing with you the chance to watch these fantastic players. Oh, you aren't thanking us? What, you didn't celebrate their achievements?

Iain Duncan Smith is called IDS, presumably because it sounds appropriately like a chronic medical condition.

Ed Miliband is sometimes called 'Red Ed', and very occasionally 'Wallace' (from Wallace and Gromit fame).


Overall, your list of people is a bit messed up. It's not really the people a British person would select to represent the parties. More likely would be Tories:

* George Osborne  
* Boris Johnson (identifiable just as 'Boris')

He will almost certainly own a huge amount of land in the Pakistani part of Balochistan (Balochistan was carved up between Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan quite some time ago). If you look at Balochistan province in Pakistan, it's quite a lot bigger than the UK and it has vast natural resources too. Despite a lot of those resources (a lot of gas) being taken by the Pakistani ruling classes (Pakistanis of other ethnicities who look down on the Baloch people and treat them like shit), I'm sure some money does come into that area too, he will almost certainly get some of that from his supporters because (a) they support him and do see him as a king and (b) they see it as important that he can live well in the UK and can promote their cause politically. 

That's the way I see it anyway, he got asylum here a few years ago and I'm surprised they took so long to give it to him, having read a few Balochistan news sites (which can definitely be more biased than our rags, so taken with a pinch of salt) there are a fuckton of assassinations and shit going on in that area all the time.

This summer I would suggest focussing on practising STEP I questions until you're relatively comfortable getting at least a grade 2 (that is - if you've covered all the material, I believe C1-4, S1 &amp; M1 are taken as a given for STEP I &amp; II). Note - for STEP III it covers material from any and every module, as well as ramping up the difficulty. STEP is really *really* hard, and you'd do well to start as early as possible. I certainly wish I'd started earlier than last January. Luckily they accepted my near-miss!

Personally I found the extra curricular reading to be quite interesting, but mostly not very helpful. At least at the college I applied to (Churchill), at the interview they couldn't care less about my personal statement etc, and were only interested in watching me stumble my way through the problems they set me. I don't see any harm though, and I imagine they considered personal statements much more carefully at other universities that don't interview.

true,dbwhrsd,JE,jersey,"It's pretty obvious where this team has lacked this season. Breaking down teams that put 9 and 10 men behind the ball. Additionally services into the box on corners have been horrendous. I'm not sure what the solution to this problem is, maybe someone who can shoot from range, someone who can shoot with both feet and strong on the ball. 

I don't have the answers, Roman pays good money to people who do. I do know that this team will be re-tooled in the transfer window and not be considered a little horse next year.  No matter how this season winds up it's been a fun campaign and there is silverware still left on the table. This is a young team, and outside of Lampard and JT these players could remain together for some a few seasons. I am excited we have an excellent core, stout defense, the one of the best tacticians in the game, and a massive transfer budget. We will be Champions next year and be on the short list of teams to win Europe. (not that we can't win this year. If we advance to the final, 90' anything can happen)

But regarding yesterday's game, it just magnified what our biggest weakness has been this season. Defending set pieces and breaking down defenses with 9 men behind the ball. 

It's bitter now, especially seeing those scousers lift the cup. But I think the blues will be dominant next year, and years to come. Look at the progress our players have made; Hazard, Schürrle, Dave, and Willian

You may have quoted me correctly, but you misunderstood me, in particular with regard to the state / commercial distinction. I proposed a ban on the inclusion of religious content by public, meaning state-funded, broadcasters. This is in keeping with liberal principles, not opposed to them, as should be obvious.  People have no choice but to fund state broadcasters, the result being the state is imposing religion on people rather than leaving them free to practise or not whichever they please. What i am proposing is exactly what happens in the US now. Public broadcasters like PBS broadcast no specifically religious programming. If people being interviewed want to talk about religion that's fine, but there are no specifically religious programmes. 

Commercial broadcasters, on the other hand, should be free to broadcast as much or as little religious programming as they please. Right now, as far as I know, in this country they are under a public service obligation to include a certain proportion of religious programming. This part of the obligation should be removed the better to preserve, not diminish, freedom of speech. The state has no business telling people to get religion. That is a matter for the individual. 

I'm surprised a serious proponent of freedom like you would find this novel or controversial. It's really pretty standard. There are many contradictions in politics, but you have to really struggle to find one between freedom of speech and the separation of church and state.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I've lived in London for nearly 8 years. Had a lot of similar experiences living with other people (friends, strangers and family) and have looked into buying in various configurations over the last year. Here are my thoughts:

Why do you want to get a larger place and rent out a room? I don't see the advantage in taking on the extra risk, both financially and in terms of who you will be living with. Rental income is not free money (yes I know about the rent-a-room scheme but to make up the numbers you'll surely need to go way above the threshold), it comes with legal obligations and it'll take up a great deal more of your time than you think.

Financially:

A 10% deposit on a £500k flat. £20k stamp duty on top of that. Look at this: http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/boeapps/iadb/repo.asp . Interest rates are at a historic low. They will rise and you *will* get bummed. Don't do it.

Socially/Personally:

If you or your girlfriend don't get along with your tenant then your living situation will be a very unhappy one. It will happen sooner or later, I've seen it many times. Two of you = twice the opportunity for bust-ups.

When (not if, trust me) you and your girlfriend decide you've had enough of living with other people, your living situation will be a very expensive one. You also can't easily move to a different place without losing a lot of money in fees and stamp duty.

My advice is:

* If your parents live near enough to London or you have other close family in London, live with them. There's no shame in it. If you are disciplined you will save an incredible amount of money. If you feel like it means you won't have fun, set aside some of it for some awesome holidays or weekend fun times. Make a decision on buying after about a year or two of work.

* If that is not an option, rent a place with your girlfriend to start with. For a year this should cost far less than the stamp duty on a £500k flat, plus you have a year (or more) to think about your long term options. The cost of buying the wrong place is very, very high. The cost of renting is fixed, at least for a year.

true,objectobject,lfc68,,"We'll need a keeper another keeper as we are short there. If we can get Fabianski on a free from Arsenal then that would be a great signing.

Rumours of us already having an agreement in place for Coentrao. That would sort out the fullback area as we'd also have Enrique back next season. Between Johnson, Flanagan, Enrique, Kelly, Wisdom and Coentrao we would be sorted there.

Ilori coming back will mean we don't need a new CB. But if we feel a good player is available then it wouldn't be a bad place to reinforce considering Toure's age and Agger's injury troubles in the past.

Between Lucas and Gerrard, I don't think we need to worry about defensive midfield.

CM is the most needed area to reinforce. One experienced and one younger would be perfect. We've been barebones in midfield nearly all season.

Attacking midfield is mostly sorted between Coutinho, Suso and Teixeira. However another signing would enable us to loan out Teixeira which would be a good position to be in.

On the wing we could do with another signing. It would enable  us to loan out Ibe again.

If Aspas leaves then we need another striker. If not then we are good in that area between Sturridge, Suarez, Borini and Aspas. Hopefully Yesil comes along well too and can make a couple of appearances next season.

So to sum up:

Backup keeper: Fabianski possibly

One LB: Coentrao rumoured

Two CM: One experienced and one young

I think there's a bit of a problem sometimes with anyone offering anything more than wide-eyed enthusiasm over players.

My thoughts on Mig are simply put. At the start of the season he was the quality deserving of our side. We weren't yet in CL. MOST of our fans, if you all remember, were talking about how 5th would be an achievement. If you look at all the predictions, very rarely did we get above 6th. Considering that, Migs was the level we were at. 

Right now we're guaranteed CL. We are pushing for a title. Is that a sustainable year to year thing? Pushing for a title with CL? Certainly we have a whole lot of momentum, regardless of how the season ends. But we're going to need a whole lot of quality depth. I look forward to the returns of Suso, Borini, Ilori, etc. But I also wonder where our side can improve our first 11. 

Right now I'd say Glen Johnson, for all the talk that his injuries held him back this year, is in a position where we can improve the quality and benefit immensely. Regardless of our rotation next season, you have to ask what will our first 11 be. 

Suarez has booked his place.
Sturridge has booked his place.
Sterling has booked his place (for all those dumbasses who wanted him on the bench mid season).
Hendo has booked his place.
Coutinho has probably booked his place.
Gerrard is unlikely to be dropped (and in this form, confidence, etc, why would you?)
Flannagan has probably earned himself a starting berth whether on the right or left.
Sahko has likely booked a spot (although our CBs, with the depth we have, will likely be rotated)
Skrtel you have to think has booked his spot.
I don't think Johnson has (or his contract would be sorted).

I - the key here, ""I"" - do not believe Mignolet has made an argument that he cannot be replaced by a better keeper.


I don't think it'd be a great idea switching the keeper again after one season. So I assume he'll stay put.

BUT, I absolutely believe Mignolet is not nearly the long term goalkeeper everyone thinks he will be. The nerves we saw him display early in the season are often still there. His shot stopping prowess certainly is better than Reina. But does that mean there's no one better than him?

For me, Mignolet and Johnson are the two players who have begged the question: can we do better. I think everyone else in our side, regardless of whether there are obviously world class players out there better, have proved their worth in the PL. I think it'd be a crime for any of them to be dropped. I don't think it'd be a crime for Migs to be replaced.

He is very stubborn and refuses to change his methods or ways. e.g constantly running players into the ground in pre-season and ruining our first half campaign. he did this continuously until the last season. his refusal to use certain youth players when we needed them (barkley, coleman, baxter, forshaw, wallace) and instead using neville in cm. he just won't accept the fact that he is wrong a lot of the times and he doesn't fix it. that makes a very poor manager in my books. pep guardiola recently came out and said his tactics lost the game v dortmund.

relegation team is a huge myth. we were never really in danger with the exception of the great escape. albeit that above average is more successful than 14th-17th. he never really gave us success. he added stability but with that he drilled the idea that placing 8th is an achievement under the budget he was operating on. but yet martinez has operated on the same budget and made improvements, made us competitive, and gave us belief.

you could say it was luck but it's most likely a case of martinez having better managerial qualities. theres no hiding the fact he has constantly praised all the players which moyes would never have done. there is an extreme amount of positivity in the club whereas under moyes it felt like a strict army camp.

i'd also say theres more chance of us signing lukaku than chelsea keeping him. with reported asking price from chelsea of 25mil and with lukaku wanting to sign with us (has hinted a lot and mentioned possibly in interviews) with only 2 years left on his contract, i'd say 20mil for lukaku is plausible for both parties.",0,1398025498,null,0,false,0,cgxjbvo,t3_23e58e,t1_cgxjbvo,t1_cgxfy3m,null,1433443277,1,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,1

I couldn't disagree more.

Just because something was influential in our history doesn't mean it is automatically the right the thing to do - yes we can acknowledge Christianity's role in shaping our country in History and RE lessons but no reason why that should extend to an organized prayer.

I disagree with special rights to any group of people over any other, and favouring one religion does that. We live in the here and now where only 60% of the country categorizes themselves as Christian, as of 2011. You're in favour of giving special treatment to 60% of the country at the cost of the remaining 40%. How is that fair to that 40%? And how is our history a good justification for that?

true,bcash,null,null,"That would be a valid point if the proposed law was vaguely sensible.  

What do I mean by sensible?  How about a comprehensive, non-judgemental categorisation system for every website?  UK-based sites would be obliged to categorise themselves accurately (with an appropriately sized fine for getting it wrong), overseas sites would be welcome to join (on submission of a fee) or would default to 18+.  This could then combine with each ISPs filters to allow individual subscribers to verify which categories they want to allow or not.

What's wrong with that?  That should work better than the current hodge-podge of filters and planned laws.

The problem is that the recent flood of anti-porn initiatives (in the form of laws, and ""voluntary"" regulation) isn't really concerned about preventing children from seeing pornography - at least not only that - the protagonists concentrate on that angle as it's the one most likely to win wider support.

What it is, is a wider more general anti-pornography in all it's forms.  These recommendations are designed to be as awkward as possible for knowing human adults.  This is why there will be multiple-levels of filters, including one which will almost certainly be a credit-card skimmers dream.

This, of course, invites a general debate on the merits and harm of pornography as both an abstract concept as well as specific examples.  But the point is that this isn't happening, and almost certainly never will either.  And what's the worst thing about such a debate not happening?  We're defaulting to a 1950's ideal that upper-middle class civil servants know best what's right for everyone.  It's a form of social engineering based on ideology disguised as protecting the vulnerable.

Pornography is, almost by definition, an emotive subject.  But I don't think we should sleepwalk into censorship by default.  I take a liberal approach to politics, and believe that censorship is only justified in a small number of circumstances (e.g. an overseas site hosting unequivocally illegal content), but classification of the type I suggested at the start is empowering.

true,RayPiste,null,null,"Great reply thank you so much.

To answer your points:

I had originally thought that 2 bedrooms gives a bit of flexibility. To begin with renting out one bedroom would presumably more than cover the increased amount of mortgage repayment and I had assumed somewhere central would be relatively easy to rent out (have obviously never done this before so I am sure there are many things I have not taken into account). Then once I have a bit more financial stability as time progresses and my salary starts to rise the 2nd bedroom can be rented out more short-term (e.g. on Airbnb) as required or used as another room. This being said, I have also been looking at 1 bedroom places and studios as I think in many areas this will be all that I can afford.

Completely take your point on interest rates as I realise I have never really been exposed to rates above 5%, I was hoping that finding a rate fixed for ~2/3 years until my salary starts to increase would somewhat cover this. (Again I may be banking on my salary increasing too much but there's a relatively high expectation on the grad scheme I'm joining that you can break £50k base after a 18 months.

Socially I get what you are talking about getting along with tenants, currently at university one of my big issues is that sharing with 5 others is a nightmare (after the fact we have terrible landlords- one of the reasons I'm keen to get out of renting so much!). Did many of the problems you have seen happen where one of the tenants was a live-in landlord? I would have hoped that this could help reduce the chance of incidents happening somewhat (may be wrong!).

My parents do live outside London but commute there for work so obviously I could do the same (they are happy for me to live rent-free as long as I'm saving) and this is an option I've been seriously considering. The main thing stopping me from deciding on going down this route is that 1) I'm expecting my hours to be pretty long and I feel like any finishes past midnight followed by an hour taxi journey home might be a bit of a nightmare, and 2) I know it's cliché and potentially I'm lying to myself but I do feel like there's value that can be had in having the option to stay later to post-work drinks and not being the person that always leaves early etc.

I can imagine what I will do is speak to some people currently in the role / industry I'll be joining upon graduation and find out how important it is to be based near the office and then use this information to either live at home for a bit and see how the housing market / interest rates fare over the next year or so, or alternatively start renting somewhere whilst exploring the different parts of London and understanding which areas are feasible for my budget / lifestyle / preferences.

Also thank you for the negative equity link, I actually read it through Monevator a few days ago and it was very true. I kind of feel that property in many parts of London are in a bit of a bubble however think that places more central can weather any financial storms slightly better.",0,1398027162,null,0,false,0,cgxk0bx,t3_23j2jz,t1_cgxk0bx,t1_cgxiixv,null,1433443596,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

---

&gt;

&gt;One Stop, which includes some of the smallest stores (smaller than a Tesco Express), is the only Tesco store format in the UK that does not include the word Tesco in its name. The brand, along with the original stores, formed part of the T&amp;S Stores business but, unlike many that were converted to Tesco Express, these kept their old name. Subsequently, other stores bought by Tesco have been converted to the One Stop brand. Some have [Tesco Personal Finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesco_Personal_Finance) branded [cash machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_teller_machine).

&gt;The business has attracted some controversy, as grocery prices in these shops, often situated in less well-off areas, can be higher than nearby Tesco branded stores, highlighted in *[The Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times)* 22 March 2010: ""Britain’s biggest supermarket uses its chain of 639 One Stop convenience stores – which many customers do not realise it owns – to charge up to 14 per cent more for goods than it does in Tesco-branded stores.""

&gt;Tesco responded to the article stating ""It is a separate business within the Tesco Group, with its own supply chain and distribution network. One Stop stores offer a different range to Express stores and its operating costs are different. One Stop’s price strategy is to match to its nearest competitor, [Costcutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costcutter), and is frequently cheaper.""  They can usually be found in smaller communities across the United Kingdom.

The water pressure on the gate kept it in place, although there was always a little leakage in a working dock which was kept in check by the pumping station.

The boats would have sat on keel blocks which were spaced at frame intervals along the length of the vessel, this supported the dry weight of the vessel.

true,koeri,null,null,"&gt; while I'd wish no one the indignity of being locked away for some sort of insanity because they're simply gay as people were in the past, there is no empirical proof it is genetic

I haven't noticed anyone claiming that it is genetic in this thread, but there is pretty strong evidence that sexual orientation is heritable to some extent.  For example, identical twins are significantly more likely to have the same sexual orientation than fraternal twins, and the sexual orientations of men who are related through their mothers are correlated (suggesting that something on the X chromosome influences men's sexual orientations).  It has been suggested that sexual orientation might be determined by [epigenetics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics): basically, there are complicated mechanisms that determine which of your genes are actually expressed, which are inherited to some extent.  Be honest, what you mean by ""there is no empirical proof it is genetic"" is ""I've no idea what I'm talking about, but it sounds unlikely to me"".

&gt; I've heard anecdotes a plenty of 'I was born that way', and personally I'm not so bothered if it's true or a memory has been filled in.

""A memory has been filled in""?  What does that even mean?  The only interpretation I can think of for all of this is that you think gay people are mad or forgetful or untrustworthy.

&gt; The reason for the declassification as a disorder was political pressure

Not really.  There was never widespread agreement among psychiatrists that homosexuality should be considered to be a disorder: even Freud thought homosexuality was perfectly normal.  The modern view is that mental disorders, by definition, must be harmful and cause distress to the patient - homosexuality clearly doesn't meet that definition.  In the 70s, when homosexuality was removed from the DSM, psychiatry was in a pretty bad place, and as far as I am aware, there was very little rigorous science underpinning any of it (the infamous [Rosenhan experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenhan_experiment) was published in 1973).  People like Kinsey had only recently started doing the first serious empirical studies on human sexuality.  There was political pressure to remove homosexuality (I'm sure there was also pressure to keep it), but that certainly isn't the main reason it was removed.",0,1398027758,null,0,1398028021,0,cgxk9g7,t3_23i10e,t1_cgxk9g7,t1_cgxfnup,null,1433443715,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"Ok, the top-line thing to understand is that HMRC can make limited disclosures where they are for the purpose of carrying on its business.  There are exemptions built into the DPA that allows this.

What they are proposing is to change the law so that additional disclosures can be made.  Part of the explanation in the response to the consultation was specifically to allow HMRC to make disclosures for purposes wider than for the benefit of carrying out its business.

There are two parts to the proposals.

1.  The release of anonymised tax data.

2.  The release of VAT registration data.

Ok, the second part is the simplest, so we'll deal with that first.  This part of the proposal proposes to release the **whole** of the data you give in your VAT registration.

This means your name, the name you trade as, your address, phone number, email address and your bank details.  That last one is the one I'd be most concerned about.

The most obvious use for this is fraud prevention.  If you start a limited company it has to be registered with Companies House.  This means certain information becomes part of the public record.  This would potentially create something similar for VAT registered traders.

Companies House doesn't tell the entire world your bank account number though.

Since it might seem fair enough to suggest I'm scaremongering by pointing that out, question 11 was this:  **""Do you agree with the proposal for controlled release of the full set of VAT registration data to qualifying parties?""**

Before we move on to the other data set, bear in mind that when it says *qualifying parties* what is proposed is permissive legislatory changes.  That is changes that allow the release of the data, not changes which make it compulsory.  This means it would be entirely legal to sell it to credit reference agencies but refuse access to other interested parties.

The anonymised data is harder to address, because the proposals don't really lay out how it would be anonymised or what data might be released. 

The issue *(as I see it)* is that no compelling case was made for the release of the data.  If there was a really strong reason to release the information it should be made and the costs and risks could be considered alongside that.

It's adding additional burdens to an already underfunded and overburdened government department with a huge amount of risk of individual level data being reconstructed to identify the individual with no coherent selling point.",0,1398028801,null,0,false,0,cgxkp3v,t3_23i950,t1_cgxkp3v,t1_cgxc475,null,1433443921,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Jericho or Cowley might have some cat-friendly apartments, though to get a decent backyard, you might have to rent in North Oxford/summertown, but some of these may exceed your budget by several hundred points.  Apartments go quickly during the summer, so an attempt to get one for October should start no later than June. Some of the places will be on the market before they are officially available, though most arrangements will go to the first person who wants to start paying rent.

The underlying socio-economic values of the potential schism are too deeply obfuscated behind political rhetoric and esoteric economic data that rarely meets the eyes of even the top level of society, for anyone to be making a truly informed choice. I dare say even the Scottish Parliament is in as much ignorance as some of the people on that account. 

If we come out the other end of this whole, then its likely the Celtic nations will turn around and persist in maintaining that England somehow owes them something more. Perhaps its true, and maybe its a tender bi-product of on-going political destabilisation.

&gt; We were the first country in the world to wholesale abolish slavery

[Hmm...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolition_of_slavery_timeline)

&gt; * 221-206 B.C.E: The Qin Dynasty’s measures to eliminate the landowning aristocracy include the abolition of slavery and the establishment of a free peasantry who owed taxes and labor to the state. They also abolished primogeniture and discouraged serfdom.

&gt; * 960: Doge of Venice Pietro IV Candiano reconvened the popular assembly and had it approve of a law prohibiting the slave trade

&gt; * 1117: Slavery abolished in Iceland

&gt; * 1200: Slavery virtually disappears in Japan; it was never widespread and mostly involved captives taken in civil wars.

&gt; * 1274: Landslova (Land's Law) in Norway mentions only former slaves, which indicates that slavery was abolished in Norway.

&gt; * 1315: Louis X, king of France, publishes a decree proclaiming that ""France signifies freedom"" and that any slave setting foot on the French ground should be freed.

&gt; * 1335: Sweden (including Finland at the time) makes slavery illegal. An abolition of slaves setting foot on Swedish ground does not occur until 1813.

&gt; * 1416: Republic of Ragusa (modern day Dubrovnik, Croatia) abolished slavery and slave trading

Actually, there are so many examples I can't be bothered copy-and-pasting the ones since 1500.

Dear Liverpool FC: Thank You for what you’ve given Luis Suarez (From your 3 million new Supporters)

Thank you.

Liverpool Football Club has gained three million new supporters in Uruguay, and this is not a common thing. All over South America, football fans generally become attached to a player and not his club in Europe. In Uruguay, things are different. And it’s something I’ve never seen happen before. The first thing I noticed that fans took positively about Liverpool FC (when Luis first joined) was the striking similarities between both football cultures. You see, Uruguay’s football culture is a bit different in that it treats its national team more like a club than the usual manifestation of nationalism seen around the world. Fans and players fight for the shirt (+ its history), and the culture very inclusive to any fan, regardless of nationality.

When Luis first went to Liverpool, Sky-Blue fans from all corners were thrilled to have discovered (maybe for the first time) a club that shared the same devotion to tradition and history in football. But what further set Liverpool FC apart was the humanity they displayed towards Luis and his small family.

Liverpool FC players and supporters are famous for the devotion they show in honouring their iconic club history.



“What was before, we see once more. Is our kingdom, a distant light”. Both football cultures (LFC and Uruguay) share a relentless need to return to the glory days and re-create the mythical feats of old.


Flash forward to the summer of 2013, and Sky-Blue fans all over the world were legitimately furious at Luis Suarez for even considering leaving Liverpool. Beyond the titles and the glamorous history, they saw a level of compassion that is rarely seen in a professional football establishment. A legend like Kenny Dalglish put his reputations on the line for what in his heart he believed was right. Friends like Glen Johnson and Steven Gerrard publicly supported him in the face of a hysterical and calculating media. You know your true friends are the ones who stand by you when a mob-like majority has ostracized you. And the fans, as well as his international teammates knew that Liverpool FC had become friends in the truest sense of the word.

These people knew that Luis would never find another club on earth as perfect as Liverpool. At the time, Liverpool FC and their supporters were understandably disappointed. But instead they continued on the same way they had always done: with class, empathy and kindness. The club and its supporters continuously offered their support (emotional and psychological), and made him feel at moer than ever. This helped him turn the page from an agonizing period in his life, and he went on to have his best ever year with Liverpool.
A re-born Luis Suarez was key in helping Uruguay qualify to the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
Also, a re-born Luis Suarez was key in helping Uruguay qualify to the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
So, all I can say is: thank you. I wish the language barrier wasn’t historically a factor in keeping these two football cultures from interacting. Because, your hairs would stand up at seeing how this entire tiny nation has taken to Liverpool’s cause. I wish all the best to our friends on Merseyside.

Sincerely,
Alvaro

We already have a currency union (amongst our other forms of union), but apparently that's not good enough.  If they want independence they can have it, but I don't think it's fair on rUK for Scotland to pick and choose the bits of us that they like as if we're some kind of menu, or like a divorce where you take the house but not the mortgage.

The risk from rUK's point of view is that we'll be responsible for bankrolling the Scottish government, but have absolutely no control over them (rather than the limited fiscal control we have currently).

true,koeri,null,null,"&gt; That may be the stated goal. I believe the true reason for going after young kids is more in line with trying to remove the uncomfortable edge in being homosexual by teaching them that it's perfectly normal.

The ""true reason"" is that most of us remember how shitty it was to go through puberty and discover that you are attracted to people you aren't ""supposed"" to be attracted to, and then waste years wondering what is wrong with you and listening to other people talk about how weird/funny/disgusting/sinful people like you are, all the while feeling  completely terrified about how other people might react if they somehow found out your secret.

&gt; Kind of like this current post where the guys says ""If everybody failed physics, then nobody fails."" Similarly, if everybody loses the notion of a normal sexuality then being homosexual may feel more ""normal"". Which is a quite common behavior, e.g, ""if we persuade ourselves that everybody do drugs, then we may feel less bad about doing drugs."" This attempts are bound to fail obviously, still people do that all the time.

I'm not quite sure how to give these analogies the response they deserve while remaining respectful, so I'll just say that failing exams and drug addiction are inherently bad, while homosexuality is not.

&gt; The ""bullying kid"" that's mocking them because they're homosexuals really only exists in their own minds

Did you not go through childhood or something?  At my high school, if you wanted to insult someone, the go-to words were things like ""poof"", ""homo"", ""gay"", ""faggot"", and ""lezzer"".  Growing up listening to your peers use descriptions of you as an insult every fucking day is completely soul-destroying.  I only knew of one pupil who dared to be openly gay, and the other kids laughed about it behind his back all the time.  I barely knew him, so I wouldn't have known if he was seriously bullied over it, but I would be very surprised if he wasn't.

&gt; basically they're trying to fix their internal psychological conflicts by changing the world, in a classical neurotic pattern.

Why, thank you for your diagnosis, Mr. armchair psychologist.

&gt; Kids are not a social experimentation playground. Do whatever you want in your own privacy, I have no issues with that whatsoever. Only leave them kids alone.

* Cameron is seen as privileged and smug, but he seems to be able to glide through chaos in his cabinet. Every u-turn and ministerial scandal look awful for his government, but never seem to blow back on him personally. Relatively popular with the nation, if not his own party, some of whom have long knives out.
* Osborne is loved by a few on the right, but wildly unpopular with the nation. Cameron's privilege and smugness turned up to 11, but where Cameron has a smooth public smile, Osborne has a nasty smirk. Tipped by some as next leader of the tories, except...
* Boris is impressively popular. Mayor of London, presents himself as a buffoon and became popular through comedy TV appearances. Utterly impervious to his scandals, which include an undisputed lovechild with an intern and using his position to prevent the police arresting a fellow Tory MP. Will actually be next leader of the tories, unless George can pull something out of the bag. Sometimes appeals to centrism.

* Ed Miliband is seen as 'meh'. He's not super-charismatic, and has failed to make a real impact. Next election is his to lose, and he's trying his hardest, although probably won't manage it. It is a popular opinion that his brother David should have been Labour leader (he was favourite until Ed's campaign blindsided him). I supported Ed then, although I'm less sure now.
* Ed Balls is either a safe pair of hands, or an awful profligate responsible for our current financial crisis, or 'who?', depending on who you ask. Known for an annoying 'flatline' hand gesture at PMQs, and a ridiculous twitter meme.

* Nick Clegg is the most unpopular man alive in Britain, with approval ratings somewhere between Jimmy Savile and the guy who gave Freddy Mercury HIV. Made a big splash leading up to the last election, and is popularly seen as breaking every single promise in their manifesto. Since his assent to government, the Lib Dems frequently lose their deposit in byelections, recently with one notably coming fifth in Nottingham after candidates from Labour, Tories, UKIP and the Bus Pass Elvis party.
* Vince Cable is seen as competent and is well respected across the political spectrum, but has done a poor job of PR in government and has been bumped into a non-job due to misguided remarks (and a Telegraph hatchet job). Probably the only Lib Dem in government who can buy a pint and be fairly sure no-one has pissed in it.

I think the vast majority of us didn't think Sterling would have that sharp of a rise in the second half of the season. This decision making and instinct is almost automatic now which is fantastic.

To be fair though, the club hasn't been this far in contention in a while and I think to see the rivals putting out silly January transfer window money is always a worrying sight. A good lesson for everyone not to get reactionary and invest in trust, not fees. Such a great season and it's all new territory for me.

The part about ENIC's intentions absolutely terrifies me, and proves my point about Levy.  He is treating Spurs as a business investment, not a football team.  He buys low and sells high with players, and he will do the same with Tottenham.  Compare that to Barry Hearn at Leyton Orient, who grew up watching Orient bc he was  too poor to attend PL matches.


I also understand the part about being hopeful.

Anyways, much of his work this season has also included undoing what previously had been done- team was tactical nightmare, no stability for players to perform consistently or even improve. We were too reliant on Mata for the past 2 seasons to get us out of trouble. Jose has come and not just changed that altogether. Players have improved massively.
 
The current lot have always struggled against lesser teams, and come up short when it required. Now we have the best record against big teams but the players fail to take the responsibility- too many needless touches or passes and no incentive to drag the team forward- and dominate the opposition. 
You're right about how awful we've been in the last 2 months.We have come up trumps against Spurs, Arsenal and PSG at home but struggled against lesser teams; surprise, surprise.
 
Mourinho has gone bonkers at the refs after the Villa game and rightly so. You might think he's only following up on building up siege mentality but it couldn't get an more blatant how much dislike there is for both Jose and Chelsea with the refs. Foy wrongly sent off Willian and cost us the game, then wrongly sent off Mourinho and charged him. Mourinho happens to ask for a few words from him and Riley and they declined to do so. That's when he lost his shit and started his silent protest at the refs. Remember how he said he came to know the true character of Foy after the game.That was when he rudely declined to talk to him after the match. Jose has asked for personal  hearing and there were suggestion he was unhappy at the how they treat him differently from others. Guess what, he gets a warning and gets fined. Now we lose at Sunderland after a dodgy penalty given by a Scouse linesman and a scouse referee at a crucial game. If this doesn't make you mad then I don't know what will.

I don't agree with this. The only time his head is down is when he's being challenged whilst dribbling... Which is what most players do, including Lampard, who was once our main playmaker.

Oscar's problem isn't his field of view or any of that crap.. Its his lack of ability to trust himself with a through pass. You can tell a lot of times when he tries a through pass he isn't 100% confident with it. Other times I've seen him pull of ridiculous chip assists etc. 

tl;dr There is nothing wrong with his field vision crap, its just that he doesn't try putting through balls enough due to the fear of giving possession away.

&gt; I've said on an earlier thread this week, but, I believe his best role would be the 3rd midfielder (Lampard role). His long shots are brilliant and he has the instincts when to make his runs.

This I do agree with. I too have said this countless times, especially when there were rumours of us selling Mata and everyone being content with Oscar being our number 1 CAM.

&gt; This is a difficult issue because how would the debt be converted into the new currency?

So on the date of changeover there would be an exchange rate set which would be applied to all assets/debts/stuff in/owned by/owed by Scotland whereby they would become denominated in the Scottish pound. I imagine it's a reasonably easy process as its been carried out quite a few times before when countries have switched currency.

&gt;Who do they owe the money to?

I guess it would be owed to the same creditors but the percentage owed by Scotland denominated in Scottish £ (or standard £'s actually)

&gt;What if they just default on it?

They would be penalised by the markets I guess? I don't know, I think its very unlikely to happen though.

&gt;Will the creditors allow the debt to be transferred to Scotland or will they demand the rest of the UK is still responsible?

I really don't know. I guess they would have to allow it. If they didn't allow it to be transferred I guess they would have to accept some sort of haircut on the debt? I'm really not sure on this one...

true,mishagale,null,null,"There are some significant differences between the US and the UK in this respect. Firstly, the trading of slaves and later the ownership of slaves was abolished in the UK  some time before it was in the US (1807 and 1833.) Even prior to then, it was only legal to own slaves in Britain's overseas possessions, not in Britain itself. This meant that there was never a very significant non-white population in Britain until after the second world war, when immigration was encouraged from the Colonies to fill labour shortages due to both deaths during the war and reconstruction efforts. That's not to say there was no discrimination, but it was largely directed at the Irish and Jewish communities. There was also a fashion in Victorian times (and later) for ""exotic"" servants, and there was especially a demand for Indian cooks. However, being Cook in a wealthy household was a comparatively privileged position by the standards of most working-class Britons.

So there was never any kind of legal framework for segregation, but it wasn't uncommon for certain groups to be refused service: the classic example is the ""No dogs, no blacks, no Irish"" signs seen in many pubs. Correspondingly, there was never really an equivalent to the organised civil rights movement, but various laws have been created which prohibit discrimination, most recently those mandated by EU directives and treaties. The earliest would be the 1965 Race Relations Act, a response to ""Race Riots"" such as the Notting Hill Riots of 1958. So while there was racism, and racial violence, it was never quite fuelled by the same long-standing grudges held in America due to the practise of slavery and the Civil War.

A couple of other relevant stories. Harriet Jacobs, an American slave who escaped to the North, writes of her visit to England:

&gt;We sailed from New York, and arrived in Liverpool after a pleasant voyage of twelve days. We proceeded directly to London, and took lodgings at the Adelaide Hotel. The supper seemed to me less luxurious than those I had seen in American hotels; but my situation was indescribably more pleasant. For the first time in my life I was in a place where I was treated according to my deportment, without reference to my complexion. I felt as if a great millstone had been lifted from my breast. Ensconced in a pleasant room, with my dear little charge, I laid my head on my pillow, for the first time, with the delightful consciousness of pure, unadulterated freedom.

Secondly, during WW2, many American units were stationed in Britain. Although these units were segregated, there was no segregation for either military or civilians in Britain, which lead to conflict. There is  a story (which regrettably I can't cite, and may be mis-remembering) about US officers drinking in a British pub objecting to the presence of blacks, and insisting the landlord throw them out. The landlord responded by banning white American soldiers from the pub. For all that British people at the time may have practised a certain amount of ""casual racism"", they tended to object to the institutionalised racism of the USA.

I don't want to pretend that my country is a paradise of integration, even today there are serious problems with inequality, racist attacks, and discrimination. But in answer to your question, we never had problems of the scale or severity of those in the USA.

Serious question:

If the debt lies with the sovereign state then why would you think it would be fair for Scotland to take a proportional debt share but hold on to currency which is allocated to the sovereign state?

I don't agree with the logistics of a currency union itself but surely if it's based on morality of some sort then it would be right for Scotland to have access to an asset it has contributed to for a long time.

I think after a vote is cast for independence then the negotiations would probably be quite reasonable anyway. There are lots of areas of shared interest and I know we can all live in harmony and form a good relationship.

Headington, a little further out than the first two but has some nice areas. Last but not least, my personal favourite (as I grew up there) is Abingdon road. Close to the centre, and easy access to Cowley road. Lots of families and the best outdoor pool in Oxford. Houses are on the whole very nice so may be a little expensive as most won't be flats (apartments). North Oxford (woodstock and banbury road) is also an option, as it's the nicest area of Oxford but it is extremely expensive.

About moving here around October, It could be problematic as most houses would have been taken by students at that point (Many more students come to Oxford during term than leave, so the population increases). But! The saving grace is that the houses that are available may have lower rates since there are fewer people looking for housing. One house I rented with my friends (4 of us) cost us 315 a month when usually it would have been more along the lines of 350.

true,tusksrus,null,null,"&gt;Also Malcolm Bruce is the Deputy Leader, wich is quite important i presume?

How important you are in politics depends on how important you make yourself in public first, and your rank in the party second. 

In the coalition government the Conservative (no one calls them the C&amp;U party although that is their full name) party holds all the major government positions: prime minister, chancellor of the exchequer, home secretary, foreign secretary. These are the key political ranks which matter the most. 

There's also the ranks of Deputy Prime Minister (which isn't as important as it sounds), held by the leader of the coalition government's junior party the Liberal Democrats (Lib Dems), or Justice Secretary (which is the modern face of the historic Lord Chancellor position), currently held by a Conservative.

For the Lib Dems, there's not a clear way to decide since they don't hold any defining roles in the Government. Obviously the leader Nick Clegg is important. The chairman Tim Farron is probably more important than he is given credit for. The only other positions that are at all notable are Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and Vince Cable, the Business Secretary. I think there's a couple more Lib Dems in the Government, but nothing notable as far as I'm aware.

For Labour, you basically just want the Leader of the Opposition (Ed Milliband) who is the leader of the main opposition party, and the Shadow Chancellor. All the other Shadow Cabinet positions seem to be interchangeable when you're in opposition, and (at least as far as rank is concerned), not important enough for you to consider probably.

All that is just about people who are notable because of their rank alone. Plenty of people are prominent because of themselves rather than their rank in the party or the Government. Boris Johnson the Mayor of London and tipped to be a future Conservative Party Leader is one example.

How many internet trolls do you think are like that in reality? The same logic applies, but on a larger scale.

But again, the two are very different. Blackmailing with CCTV requires confrontation. If I get blackmailed, I know exactly who blackmailed me, where s/he works, what s/he looks like, what his/her name is, if s/he's wearing a nametag, who the witnesses were.. the list goes on. All of this can be used to build up a legal case against the blackmailer.

Scotland will not so much move left or right, as the entire landscape of debate will tilt and shift, and some elements will end up to the right, some to the left.

true,mtempissmith,null,null,"Yeah, except in this case, River, who's never set foot on Gallifrey, we know has regenerated at least 3X. I'm not sure that I buy that Jenny doesn't have the ability to regenerate. She's a clone and while she is technically from The Doctor she may have somewhat different genetics by how she was produced. For all we know her not being able to regenerate might have more to do with her being a female clone of his than his actual offspring. 

River was conceived in the Tardis during her parents time traveling days. She's not really Gallifreyan she's a human who somehow got made into something very like a Time Lord because she was conceived within a time machine but is she a Time Lord in the sense that The Doctor is? Maybe, maybe not. We'll never know how many regenerations she might have had or how Gallifreyan she might really have been because she gave up all of her regenerations to save 11. But it could very well be she'd have not been like the Time Lords we know at all. 

I personally don't get River's existence in a way. It's a bit of a plot hole. I mean The Doctor took away Donna's being a Time Lord because he said her human brain simply couldn't handle it. Yet here we have River born of two very human parents walking around regenerating and all that as if she was born on Gallifrey and had been fully prepared for being a Time Lord. Even after she lost her regenerations she's still acts like one most of the time. Seems being human must not have been too much a problem for her at all.

The only thing I can think is that somehow the Tardis altered her DNA to be more Gallifreyan so she could live with it. Post loss of regenerations she seems almost like Alt-10. Human, but somehow able to stand what Donna somehow could not. It kind of bugs me.

And then while you're back in London the following day, make this a day to relax in the quiet, smaller, more residential parts of the city, eating at a local cafe or restaurant, strolling down the canals, through the parks and the free sites (remember to leave a donation), admiring the architecture, and shopping. Also be mindful of the weather. Raining? Do more indoor stuff. Sunny? Make the most of the sunshine. Visit at least one spa town, one royal status town, one seaside resort, and one cathedral city. And take guided boat tours down the rivers towards the end of the day if available.

Go on a walk or trail, such as Wainwright's Walk or Hadrian's Wall. Festival season is starting, so maybe buy some tickets?

Sherwood would pick Ben Arfa over Dan Gosling at least. 

Think of it this way, if you had the choice between Pardew and Sherwood would you pick Pardew? The same Pardew who has lost 5 straight? The same Pardew who has lost every single match bar 3 since the close of the transfer window? You want him over Sherwood? I have to beg to differ.

When reading people's arguments about whether the Mail was right to do the piece or not it seems that they fall into two main camps: People that don't see anything wrong in this kind of exposé as ""there are loads of people scamming the system"" and this article highlights that, and people that feel it's wrong because ""there's a small minority of people scamming the system.""

In both cases, no one has presented any evidence to support how many people are actually conning the system. I suspect that this is because there aren't any figures supporting either claim. What I feel is being lost from this discussion is the one set of figures that we do have, which is the x3 increase in food bank usage. What would cause the rise? Are some people now more likely to be incapable of handling their finances, choosing to blow it all on cigarettes and Sky TV? Are people becoming less trust worthy and therefore more likely to take advantage of a free meal? Are government policies effecting people's ability to feed themselves? Is it something else entirely?

Personally it seems unlikely that there has been a large jump in people's desire to cheat the system. Maybe more are struggling to feed themselves and pay for Sky, but the cost of Sky hasn't jumped up dramatically in the last year. It could be that spiraling food costs are squeezing their finances more? Maybe the newly introduced policy of withholding benefits for a period of time could be a factor?

There is the diamond you are talking about where our midifield is CDM - LM - RM - CAM. And then there is the CDM - LCM -RCM - CAM diamond.
Firstly, understand a formation is just the ""average"" position of the players.  

In the diamond, Lucas and Allen have the task of breaking up opposition play and help win the ball back. Now Norwich or basically any other team that builds their attack from the wings, usually overload the space with the winger and the fullback. now in such scenarios Lucas or Allen have to assist our fullbacks to counter the threat and win the ball back. Thus, it may look like Lucas and allen are playing on the wings.  

Now, if there is a team that attacks more through the center of the pitch then Lucas and Allen remain central so that we dont lose the midfield battle in the middle. 

Also in attack, our formation is much more free form where we spread out our players around the opponents playing area and Lucas and Allen move into spaces where our more creative players can pass to them to keep the attack going.",0,1398053097,null,0,false,0,cgxus6q,t3_23k76y,t1_cgxus6q,t3_23k76y,null,1433448804,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

We need full backs.  If Johnson goes, we'll need someone on the right, and Jose needs decent left footed cover on the left.  Flannagan has been great, and will continue to do so, great as cover.

A defensive midfielder would also be good.  Gerrard wont play all games next year, and we need someone who can sit in front of the back 4 the way Lucas can.  M'Villa has been mentioned many times, but I've never really watched him.

THe Will Hughes rumours have died down, but talk was we had signed a pre contract agreement type thing.  

Konoplyanka would be great, or at least another pacey winger (left footed), someone who can change the game from the bench.  This is what we have missed this season.  Our first 11 is very strong, but we can't really make that change that turns the game around.

true,electricidiot,null,null,"Gaiman was obviously contacted about writing an episode, and if you're not a regular member of staff, clearly they're going to go over every line with a fine tooth comb even more so than a salaried staffer's script to look for heresy on a show like this. So if the idea was considered beyond the acceptable scope of the canon, then they'd have pulled it. Simple as that really. Gaiman has no special powers to force the line to be in the show. He wrote it, Moffat liked it, liked the idea of it, so he left it in.

And the line where shortly after regeneration Eleven touches his hair and says ""I'm a girl!"" with obvious excited wonder, but not astonishment at an impossibility, was a RTD line (possibly with collaboration or with the involvement of Moffat, as this was the hand off from one writer to the next). In and of itself, it's not a fantastic bit of evidence in gender swap regenerations being common, but I think his finding his Adam's Apple and relaxing a bit indicates this was more than just a bit of fun with a new hairstyle.

But two things, though. First off, I have to say, hahaha, to the idea of there being a ""Doctor Who Canon"" that is established rock solid and cut in stone that can never ever be changed. Going back to the very first Doctor, this series has been nothing more than add on some ideas here, refine some ideas there, add in some new ideas here, and so on forever. Regeneration wasn't part of the ""original canon,"" if you like, but was thrown in for practical acting reasons. Chen-7 as a disease that could kill two-hearted species and prevent regeneration was a novel introduction to the ""canon."" Chameleon Arch allows you to change your biology entirely to human? 

Secondly, I'm going to venture to say that 1.) guy hired to write episodes, then later 2.) promoted to run the show, and 3.) given power to hire other people to write the shows, gets a much bigger vote on what is and isn't ""canon"" than ""Redditor on the boards who objects to the idea of the Doctor becoming a woman."" I assume that the Ninth Doctor saying he could regenerate with two heads was just as much a leap into uncharted ""canon law"" as mentioning getting a vagina instead of a penis. I assume that a temporary Doctor Donna is just as much a leap into uncharted ""canon law"" as a clone Gallifreyan who can heal her body if not regenerate entirely. I assume that changing race is as much a leap into uncharted canon law not much discussed back in the hallowed days of the Carved in Stone first season of Doctor Who.

So hmmm, at what point does an idea gain entrance to the canon? Who gets to make that call? Who gets to say ""this is canon"" and ""this is so not canon""?",0,1398054844,null,0,false,0,cgxvhl0,t3_23hs23,t1_cgxvhl0,t1_cgx9mfl,null,1433449136,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Since then, we've played 5 home games and won, as well as 6 away games which we've won. This puts the win streak at 11. The graph only shows the *last* 6 of each. 

Here's an easy way to look at it:

W (H) Everton

D (A) West Brom

W (H) Arsenal

W (A) Fulham

W (H) Swansea

W (A) So'ton

W (A) *Moyeschester United*

W (A) Bond Villan's Lair

W (H) Sunderland (Agent Borini's mission)

W (H) Spurs

W (A) West Ham

W (H) Man City

W (A) Norwich

The West Brom slip up is sandwiched between 2 home wins, but is beyond six away games ago. Just count the last 6 of home and away games and you'll see why the form guide is the way it is, but our streak is still 11 wins.

I'm probably the only person I know (besides my family, many of whom are Scots or at least half-Scottish) who cares about the whole Scottish independence thing and recently I've started giving it a lot of thought because I might be moving to Edinburgh in the coming months - most likely before September. That means that now I'm probably going to get the ability to vote. While I do have Scottish heritage I was born and raised in England so I'm not sure I *will* vote even if given the opportunity, but I'll just wait and see I suppose.

Right now I'm definitely not informed enough to form a solid opinion on the matter. A lot of people say Scotland couldn't survive on its own, but I don't see why it couldn't. It might be a rocky beginning (as it would be with *any* country gaining independence) but if it turns out to be ultimately better for them to be independent, maybe it's a good thing. On the other hand maybe it's better for them to stay a part of the UK and just be given more self-governing powers to stay shielded from the worst of tory policies. It's quite telling that there is no more than *one* tory MP north of the border and absolutely no UKIP support. Politically, Scotland and England are growing further and further apart. 

But really I don't think the average English person thinks about it all that much because it's out of their hands. They're not getting a vote and they can't control if Scotland goes independent or not. They're mostly of the ""sit back, watch and see what happens"" persuasion.

If we hadn't completely shafted it this past weekend I would be 100% behind you. I'm saying this because I knew Norwich would be a tough game for LFC, they handled them away and I think they can dispatch Palace too because Suarez is picking up pace again.

This loss means we are betting on luck, we are betting against the odds. A rookie mistake. 5 points behind with 3 games to play and if you think LFC can fuck it up, believe me we have had our fair share of fuck ups this season.

Let's pack our bags and travel to Madrid with one goal in mind. To win. Then we can go to anfield, much like we did 2 years ago and hope for the best, but we MUST make it to the UCL finals.

For the first goal, he shouted to Skrtel to leave it, he was 50/50 by the time he got there, if his anticipation was better he could have out leaped before then or jumped with Skrtel to increase the odds.

I have noticed he doesn't seem to dive where the ball will be unless the situation is direct, the Man City first goal I thought was obvious of Silva. Second was Johnson and Skrtel.

But all this can be coached and training with Suarez, Sterling and Skrtel he'd get good practice. Anticipation type saves, quick one on one situations and defending crosses.

true,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,"Interesting stats.  There's no doubt that particularly lately, we've become specialists are coming from behind to get a result.

I think a couple of things...

Firstly, the Sherwood era has been marked by the individual performances of two outstanding attackers - Eriksen and Adebayor - rather than a cohesive team attack.  Eriksen's goal/assist stats over the last five or six games are leading the league, and Adebayor had similar stats at one point.  So I do feel that some of our results have been down more to two players with something big to prove, rather than evidence of great managerial nous.

Secondly, most of the teams that we've clawed our way back from a deficit/level first half have been, frankly, shit teams.  Fulham twice, Sunderland, Swansea, Hull.  These are teams that other top four contenders have been able to regularly put away with ease, not with a sustained fightback.  Hell, the win over Fulham at the weekend was against the worst defence/goal difference in the league, and it still took a Lloris wonder save AND a penalty save to win convincingly, and that was at home.  Southampton is one of the few decent teams we've managed to come back against, but that was arguably due to their inexperience first time round, and then lack of really having anything to play for second time around.

Against shitty teams we've consistently conceded first or let them equalise.  Liverpool are top of the league right now precisely for the opposite - they've regularly used the opening 10-15 to score or something completely close out games to make the second half almost moot.

It's true that to succeed you need to learn how to win ugly and fight back.  But I think the mark of truly successful sides is to not even give your opposition a sniff to begin with.  That's our weakest aspect, and it's worst of all against the top four.

If Sherwood is giving us so much fight and psychological strength, then where is it when we play a team above us?  I dare say he's not giving it to us - great players like Eriksen and Adebayor are just exploiting lesser teams of their own agency.",0,1398063568,null,0,false,0,cgxy1n2,t3_23kcr8,t1_cgxy1n2,t3_23kcr8,null,1433450341,9,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,9

FANTASTIC write-up, thank you sir. Thoroughly enjoyed the read and fresh perspective (even though I just commented that we've seen this sort of post already) (the statistics were tasty).

As far as not being able to ""not get the intensity in the first 45,"" I can only guess that Tim prefers a cautious sort of 1st half, whether or not he sets out his team to actually play cautious. I think he's more than comfortable reacting to what the opposing team show through one half and is good at predicting what they'll do in the 2nd (the latter may not be as tough, especially if it's lowly West Brom with a shock start and 2-goal lead, but you get the idea).

//e Because Norway's technically outside of the EU (for shipping purposes...), if someone ships them to you from the UK, then they'd need to fill out a customs declaration. You'd also pay the UK version of merverdiavgift (Which is cheaper anyway, 20% instead of 25%, and only on certain types of books, as per 701/10 below), and possibly end up paying toll as well, depending on how much the books cost.

Derp, VAT notice 701/10 makes books zero-rated for tax.

&gt;3.1 Books and booklets

&gt;These normally consist of text or illustrations, bound in a cover stiffer than their pages. They may be printed in any language or characters (including Braille or shorthand), photocopied, typed or hand-written, so long as they are found in book or booklet form.

&gt;Supplies of any of the following are zero-rated:

&gt;    * literary works  
&gt;    * reference books  
&gt;    * directories and catalogues  
&gt;    * antique books  
&gt;    * collections of letters or documents permanently bound in covers  
&gt;    * loose-leaf books, manuals or instructions, whether complete with their binder or not, and  
&gt;    * amendments to zero-rated loose-leaf books, even if issued separately.  

&gt;School work books and other educational texts in question and answer format, are zero-rated because the spaces provided for the insertion of answers are incidental to the essential character of the book or booklet. The same applies to exam papers in question and answer format provided they qualify as books, booklets, brochures, pamphlets or leaflets.

&gt;But supplies of the following are standard-rated:

&gt;    * books of plans or drawings for industrial, architectural, engineering, commercial or similar purposes  
&gt;    * picture card and stamp albums, unless they contain a substantial amount of reading matter which is complete in itself, and no more than 25% of the album is set aside for the mounting of cards and stamps  
&gt;    * completed stamp albums, and  
&gt;    * products that are essentially stationery items, for example, diaries and address books.

Europe is a different monster in terms of how a team usually plays, and I firmly believe our team can do amazing in Europe. 

Our team is weird in the sense that most teams rely on their strikers or wingers to score, and midfielders chipping in is like the cherry on the cake.

We on the other hand are the exact opposite. Our midfielders have to score and a striker scoring is like an added bonus. This means that our midfielders have to focus not only on creating chances, but scoring them, which, let's face it, if they had an eye for goals or shooting boots, they'd have probably become strikers. 

Your midfield's priority should be to control a game, we can do that already, but to have nearly the entire burden of scoring goals on them is asking for ALOT that not many players can do. 

Top strikers score you 25+ goals a season. Top midfielders, barring Lamps, would score you 10-15. Our lack of finishing this season has cost us the chance to wrap up this race. We still have a fighting chance and I'm not giving up, but if we had a decent striker and players were a little more clinical, which can happen since the team is extremely young, we would have walked away with the premiership by now.",0,1398070878,null,0,false,0,cgxzb49,t3_23i45y,t1_cgxzb49,t1_cgxyz7z,null,1433450936,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

Without that, any referendum would have been illegal since Holyrood doesn't have the constitutional power to hold referendums on independence.

* 2.) Deliver a **fair and decisive** outcome. Which it will, since both parties have effectively agreed to honor the outcome of the referendum, and, after much wrangling the scope of the question has been set in such a way as to avoid ambiguity.

This is where I think they are wrong. They will run into problems if they join the EU with this strategy - and this isn't Ireland in the 1990s... UK corporation tax has come down a lot since the recession began and looks set to continue falling. They are also stuck in an awkward position with the currency situation. Unlike Ireland, there isn't going to be overnight support for joining the EU - and entering into any sort of widespread use of the pound (in fiscal union or otherwise) is likely to come with heavy provisos from The City of London that the Scots cannot simply undercut UK tax rates to ""Steal"" business from the larger partner of their currency union - whilst simultaneously using the creditworthiness of the much larger rUK to float those businesses.

Now I'm inclined to think that people are trying to force her out but not because they're Muslims.  Broadly, when I've encountered the kind of person who can do what she's done they come in two flavours; the kind who puts vast and incredible amounts of pressure to perform on everyone and the kind that meets everybodies needs to see what happens.  Generally I find the former to be more common, especially given the timeframe.

The worrying issues are the complaints that non-muslims are being persecuted and that Ofsted were already investigating, though it should be pointed out that 'non-muslims being persecuted' could be more a sign of the time than fact.

It's not as clear cut. Maybe it would be a good idea to give that power to the local authorities like /u/G_Morgan suggested in his comment, so each case can be reviewed individually.

I mean, a 25 year old professional does not necessarily need a 2 bedroom apartment.

Even prior to then, it was only legal to own slaves in Britain's overseas possessions, not in Britain itself. 

To add to this, black slaves brought into England were still considered property. However, enslaving a freed or escaped slave was still illegal. Also  some black people that fought for the British came to London after the American Revolution. So there was actually a small but sizeable population of freed and escaped black people in London during the 18th century. Not that they had much chance for employment other than servitude, mind.

* Because at this stage, if Westminster could somehow magic HMNB Clyde somewhere else they'd do it in a heartbeat - It's a huge political motivator for the SNP and its jobs that could be moved somewhere else where there might be more public gratitude (perhaps Devonport in Plymouth). But moving it is going to take decades of construction and investment elsewhere, a lot of money and a bit of local government wrangling to convince its new neighbors of its merits. 

* Secondly, since the rUK cannot afford to easily relocate the base, especially at short notice, forcing it off the Clyde would be tantamount to forcing the UK to unilaterally disarm. Now... a lot of people on either side of the border probably wouldn't care too much about that. But Washington will care a great deal. The last thing the USA want to see is the worlds third nuclear power and their closest ally unilaterally disarming. 

* It seems likely that US/NATO pressure together with what the rUK can reasonably be expected to achieve (and afford!) will mean that HMNB Clyde will stay part of the rUK (no doubt in exchange for concessions so the Scottish government can sell the idea locally as a victory). My guess is it would be a UK Sovereign Overseas Territory like Akrotiri and Dhekelia in Cyprus, for a period of maybe 10-20 years, after which ti would become an ostensibly *joint* UK-Scottish base under the auspices of NATO (though probably effectively run by the Royal Navy but with Scottish branding on the gates - Like the Anglo-Spanish NATO base at Gibraltar).",0,1398075315,null,0,1398075508,0,cgxzxt1,t3_23ja62,t1_cgxzxt1,t1_cgxzrye,null,1433451233,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

How many people were arrested after Hillsborough? How many police chiefs after pushing those Liverpool fans into the stadium, as young as 10 have been arrested?

When was the editor of the S*N arrested and charged for lying and defaming the dead and injured? When was the police brought to court for altering the Taylor report and changing the words of police officers to suit there own story?

And more importantly both disasters could have been stopped if they weren't played in those stadiums. There were crushes in Hillsborough in 1981 and in Heysel in the semi final in 1984.﻿Both stadiums were a ticking time bomb.

Perhaps it was a normal reaction to finally being able to publicly identify his true self, after decades of having to hide it for fear of ostracism or worse?

Having said that - I don't really like camp behaviour because IMO it is rarely natural behaviour, but a reaction to a hostile (albeit decreasingly) society.  I think it's this, rather than homophobia, that is putting a lot of gay men's teeth on edge, this overt public display of homosexuality as if it's the most important thing about a person.

It should be noted that not all camp men are gay, but that's another story...

true,fuckin_ziggurats,null,null,"&gt;Firstly, the Sherwood era has been marked by the individual performances of two outstanding attackers - Eriksen and Adebayor - rather than a cohesive team attack. Eriksen's goal/assist stats over the last five or six games are leading the league, and Adebayor had similar stats at one point. So I do feel that some of our results have been down more to two players with something big to prove, rather than evidence of great managerial nous.

So every good thing is not due to Sherwood but every bad thing (like individual player errors) is due to Sherwood? This is such an obviously biased logic.

&gt;If Sherwood is giving us so much fight and psychological strength, then where is it when we play a team above us? I dare say he's not giving it to us - great players like Eriksen and Adebayor are just exploiting lesser teams of their own agency.

Do you really consider us better than Chelsea, Liverpool or Arsenal this season? Adebayor and Eriksen are the only offensive players that are doing their work this season and 2 players definitely can't compete against the full midfields of the top teams. 

The crosses from our wingers are shit and our strikers don't convert the rare good ones, and it's cost us our season. We spent too much time trying to get Soldado to score when we could've played Kane (yes I'm serious).

I'm sure we all understand the thinking behind the adage that *it's important to leave them wanting more*, but the degree to which the likes of Sherlock and Endeavour are taking it, is frankly absurd. 

A more subtle – and, I'm sure, equally effective – ending to this series of Endeavour would have been to simply leave Thursday's survival in doubt. Roger Allam is one of the best parts of the show, so that possibility alone is upsetting enough to pique the interest of most fans. 

The main effect of this ending is that we now already know what the first storyline will have to be in the next series. Speaking for myself, I prefer not knowing what is coming next, even on an episode-to-episode basis, which is why I also hate the modern trend for ""advertising"" the next episode in a series with clips that give away almost the entire plot. But at least those are shown separately to the main story, so I can quickly switch channels to avoid their stupid spoilers if I want. A series that ends this way removes that choice. They could still have the same storyline in the next series, but have Morse arrested at the beginning so that it comes as a surprise *then*.

If you ask me, some TV executives need to be reminded of another important adage when it comes to deciding how to maintain interest in their shows between series: and that is sometimes, *less is more!* ",0,1398082863,null,0,false,0,cgy1aod,t3_23jv8j,t1_cgy1aod,t3_23jv8j,null,1433451939,2,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,2

true,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,"&gt; So every good thing is not due to Sherwood but every bad thing (like individual player errors) is due to Sherwood? This is such an obviously biased logic.

I never said Sherwood had nothing to do with the two good players in our team.  In fact, I've often pointed out in the past on here that I'm glad AVB got the boot this season purely to bring Adebayor back into the fold.  Sherwood deserves some credit for that.  Plus I personally like Eriksen on the left.  A lot of people on here don't, but it's hard to argue with his performances.  I don't think playing him in the middle would've reaped more rewards than we've already had.

But - and this is very telling - no one else has performed anywhere close to their level.  So doesn't it stand to reason that if Sherwood was such a great man manager and motivator that the whole squad would pick up in performance too?  Look at Everton for example - I can't imagine many people on here would argue that man-for-man they've got a better squad on paper than us.  But they're all playing out of their skins this season because they've got a manager drawing it out of them, who is tactically setting them up in ways to maximise their abilities.

&gt; Do you really consider us better than Chelsea, Liverpool or Arsenal this season? Adebayor and Eriksen are the only offensive players that are doing their work this season and 2 players definitely can't compete against the full midfields of the top teams.

No, we are not better than those three teams nor City, but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't have been able to compete with them.  We haven't been competitive with them at all... rather, we've completely capitulated.

The '19 defensive mistakes' are far too many to just be a coincidence either.  You don't think they're been exacerbated by Tim and AVB's tactics?

Both have played a high defensive line with fullbacks pinned high up the wings, effectively leaving us with two CBs left to cover the entire width of the park.  They continually get split by through balls and runs from midfield, but Sherwood doesn't want to play a proper CDM.  And yet the same patterns keep emerging again and again - balls and runs through our midfield that draw one of our CBs out of position and then leave the other overrun.  Our fullbacks are constantly being forced to turn tail and run back into position at pace, and yet arrive late, facing our goal, and out of position.  Walker is pretty good at managing that, but without him we've struggled even more.  Not to mention the fact that our defensive shape often gives us very few options to pass out of the back to and vulnerable to the high press, which results in lots of shitty rushed passes to men already being harried by opposition players, or aimless punts upfield that just get won by the opposition who come straight back at us.  No wonder we've fucked it up at the back so many times this season!

Soldado being even a shadow of the player he was at Valencia would've helped, but AVB completely ruined our chances of that happening by playing a system that never worked for him and then running him into the ground while his confidence ebbed away.

Both Sherwood and AVB can take credit for some good things this season, but there aren't many.  There are far more obvious managerial blunders than there are achievements.",0,1398083824,null,0,false,0,cgy1ixr,t3_23kcr8,t1_cgy1ixr,t1_cgy0n1m,null,1433452046,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

But currency union is unpopular. It was unpopular with Europe, and it's unpopular with Scotland. Regardless of how good YES voters think it will be, the argument is lost, because it is politically toxic. It won't change in rUK in the event of a YES vote, and your ""a more reasonable atmosphere"" comments are, if you'll forgive me, somewhat typical of SNP responses where the reality is ignored in favour of a blasé assurance that things will work out the way the SNP wants, despite all the evidence to the contrary.

The whole cutting of benefits seems pretty ideological. Funnily enough, IDS' universal benefit reforms have cost a whole lot more than they saved (massive IT overhaul project + big contractors like IBM = £££). The whole point of cutting public services was to service the deficit, and they haven't even done that! All they've done is cut benefits to people who actually need them, with no discernible benefit to anyone.

I find it deliciously ironic that ATOS, the company that won the contract to inspect whether people are fit for work, recently admitted they are not fit to work this project. Haha. The dark side is it's caused a huge amount of pain and stress for poor and vulnerable people and cost an awful lot of money.

Seems like PR to me. Or maybe they just really believe benefits aren't good on a moral level.

also, i'd generally recommend living (renting) in a location before you buy there. you need to know where the nice areas are (which can vary from one of the street to another).

going past this advice, there isn't much wrong with the plan you have (assuming you are comfortable with the above risks, and the risks of higher interest rates etc).  one thing that might be worth considering is to include your dad's property in the mortgage calcs, or for him to re-mortgage his existing home rather than both of you mortgage the new flat. this will mean he borrows money at a lower LTV and hence lower interest rate. he can then buy his half of your flat with cash, and make repayments on his own mortgage however he wishes.  he then gives you the money (or call it a loan if he prefers) and you can borrow the rest with a much bigger deposit = lower LTV &amp; lower interest rate.

Some peoples worldview is just so out of sync with reality. It would be sad if they weren't so utterly vile and hateful. Thankfully I'm of the mind that these people (Telegraph commenters) are a very small minority. I think most people recognise how vile these sort of comments are, even if many have their concerns about immigration I think they're far more reasonable about them and moderate.

&gt;The promotion of ""multiculturalism"" is actually an incitement to commit genocide. The destruction of the culture or a national identity, BY ANY MEANS, is genocide, as defined by UN Convention on Genocide!

&gt;The accepted punishment for these crimes, as defined by previous cases, is death. Death by hanging in fact.

&gt;So not quite ""arrested and executed"". Lets do ""Arrested, Tried, Judged then if found guilty (of promoting ""multiculturalism"") ... death by hanging.

&gt; Academia has been one of the main conspirators in the deconstruction of our society and responsible for the Broken Britain we now inhabit today. Many of these Academics are outright traitors actively pushing for a New World Order.

&gt;There is still a brief window of time in which Britain can use the justification provided by its Christian heritage to reject Islam and banish it from the public sphere.

Uh, what? What justification does a Christian past give to the criminalisation of Islam as a religion?

&gt;Let's face it though this will not happen and schools, councils and soon whole regions of the country will become effectively independent Islamic enclaves.

Yes, because what we *really* need is for schools to enforce division between the children of different faiths. An awful idea for the same reasons that faith schools are. They enforce segregation.

If Chelsea were to win the League, they needed to win all remaining games starting against Sunderland. What is most bitter about this pill is after having our destiny in our hands, we spectacularly flop at the first hurdle against the bottom team.

Chelsea can beat anybody on their day. Unfortunately they can also lose to anyone, this season we have barely performed above tick-over. Remember 2010 when our final four results were something like 6-0, 7-1, 7-0, 8-0.
That is how you win the League, not sitting around hoping that another lot are going to give you a life line.

I don't think most people who criticize BGT are either.  I think it's more likely a case of becoming aware of one aspect or another of the tv show and disliking it.  I didn't put much thought into coming to the conclusion I did.  I saw people being with absolutely no talent, charisma or stage presence being mocked and humiliated on a ""talent show"" being aired on national tv.  It doesn't take much thought to realise there's something not quite right going on there.

&gt;I wouldn't say it's over analysing anyone's behaviour when they're blatantly slagging people off for watching low-brow reality tv shows, no analysis required there, pal.

I'd say that's something relatively separate from the analysis side of things.  I don't think I could sit through an entire episode of BGT but I wouldn't look down on others that enjoy it.  The brain wants what the brain wants after all.

If anything we were collapsing towards the end of last season with Mancini &amp; Balotelli bust-ups, losing to Wigan in the FA cup final, players threatening to leave...

Basically this journalist has just covered every possibility of why we're not top of the league, he's not specifically looked at our season, analysed it and drawn a conclusion that starts something like ""Yep, here's what went wrong..."". I could've written this article.

I think everyone on here knows we've over used the likes of Zaba, Yaya, Ferna, Kompany, Silva. And when he's been fit, despite missing games, Aguero has been rushed back to play. Pellerz has been given a massive responsibility by the club and with this being his first big shot at winning trophies, in a new league (one which punishes you if you give anything but 100%), can we really say we're surprised to see him starting Yaya every game, and the likes of David Silva who we so greatly miss? The early losses in the league to Cardiff and Sunderland made Pellerz realise he has to go fighting every single game and if he rocked up with a team sheet that looked something like Hart - Richards - Demi - Lescott - Clichy - Javi - Rodwell - Nasri - Navas - Dzeko and didn't walk away with 3 points from that match then he'd get absolutely destroyed by the media, fans, club directors. I'm not saying that isn't a good team, of course it is, but it's not the best we can produce which is what we have to do week in week out.

One thing I would say which I think Pellerz does need to do more is get worked up with the players. I know at half time he can change the game around - look at the Liverpool match for example - but when players just simply aren't delivering he needs to sit them down and say ""fucking work for your place in this team"". Without that then the team will start to become complacent which is exactly what has happened in recent weeks. There's less hunger about the team now than at the beginning of the season and I think Pellerz needs to kick a couple of players up their arse and get them to deliver.

Christianity isn't necessarily a defining characteristic of 'Britishness', anymore. Take my area, for example  - I actually live in a caravan on a travellers' site in the inner city.  The local population is very multicultural, and several faiths are represented. Neither myself nor any of the born-and-bred brits I know (except my mum!) identify as having any religion at all. 

There *is* a lot of Christianity in the area though, the churches are busy on Sundays - but the people you are waiting outside are entirely Caribbean migrants, some of whom are second or third generation, and thus qualify as born-and-bred brits, too. Otherwise, this community largely seems to maintain their own distinct culture.  We also have a large population of Muslims of African and Asian origin, and, again, many of these people are now British citizens. 

It's not a bad community to live in. Really, we're a mixed bag of a country these days,  and attempts to define Britain as a Christian country - or any homogenous group - risk also defining anyone who doesn't fit these narrow terms as non-british. It also seems like an inability to understand the changing nature of our society.

At least the Dacres of this world admit that their religiosity is simply a reflex, they go to church because its what they ought to do and they are in fact circumspect about God and faith etc. But Cameron's Sunday sermon sounds like someone trying to draw the disaffected elderly Tories back to the flock.

true,CrashingAnalyst,eng-gloucestershire,Cheltenham,"I was part of a team that interviewed Greg Dyke about 5 years ago and we did ask him something along those lines (tied in with, is TV dying compared to the internet).

His point was that these tv shows aren't supposed to be the height of artistic knowledge, but rather they're a comfort for families to sit around and enjoy a shared experience - laughing at the bad acts and being in awe of the good ones.

That's what TV has at heart that no other art medium has so strongly - the ability to sit around at home with your family and all enjoy it together.

So, I guess the answer to 'What does watching this show do for you' is that it's a social crutch. We're also pretty spoilt in this day and age with regards to the availability of media - if we don't like what's on the TV most of us have 50+ live channels to turn over to now, and if that doesn't take our fancy all the major services have catchup services, and if THAT doesn't take our fancy there's the internet, video games, films, youtube, netflix, reddit.... it just goes on.

One genuine question I have is why people find vapid media so offensive? You find this even on amatuer YouTube videos - people comment with some pretty harsh commentry, and the same in this thread with regards to BGT, where people have the option to -not watch-.

Part of the problem is that whenever this stuff gets brought up it's typically sold in terms of, *""You're paying for these wealthy bastards!""* without understanding to the Crown Estate.

true,GlassesAndMoustaches,logo,Merlin,"Let's start by getting the obvious out the way - we **need** this one. West Brom at home, on the back of a disappointing game to Sunderland, I feel the lads owe us something. I think the Liverpool game is still echoing around the heads of a few people but if we're going to finish this season on a high I feel we need to put all that behind us.

No Yaya or Silva for this one so I feel we may see a 4-4-2 again. With 4 fit strikers (Do I dare say it?) the possibilities are endless! Well, not really, but it's nice to have the options open. Considering how brilliant they were at the beginning of the season, I expect the Aguero and Negredo partnership to reappear. I think Rodwell also deserves an appearance this game; Ferna and Javi in the middle is our second best option behind Ferna and Yaya but the young Englishmen is a little more attacking driven than Javi so I'd like to see him play this home game. I think Navas has a dodgy something, so I wouldn't be surprised if he's on the bench. Albeit this late in the season, I'm expecting a cautious selection by Pellerz with him not wanting anything but 3 points from each remaining fixture. Therefore I expect something similar to previous matches. So, without further ado, here's my predicted line up:

Mr head and shoulders himself: Joe Hart

Zabaman - Kompany - Demichelis - Kolarov

Nasri - Ferna - Javi - Jimmy Milner

Beast - Agueroooo

I'm feeling rather ballsy today so I'll try and dabble a little bit in tactics. If we're drawing or losing around the 60th minute mark yet dominating possesion I feel Javi might come off and be replaced by one Stevan Jovetic. Kolarov will help on the left side of the midfield as Milner drifts a little more inwards and Jovetic will play just behind the 2 strikers - effectively switching to a 3-4-3 on attacks then 4-3-3 as we defend. Alternatively if we're winning by 3 goals or more then I expect us to bring off one of the strikers, replace them with Rodwell and (now this could be the one that makes you go ""woah, what?"") if we're proper winning then replace Zaba for Boyata. Zaba has started almost every game this season and if we're winning we may decide to give him a rest. With all our injured and unfit players at the mo we're gonna have trouble filling the bench so I won't be surprised to see Boyata on there at all.

I'm gonna be ultra ballsy and predict a final score: 3-0 City ",0,1398091990,null,0,false,0,cgy47c8,t3_23lap6,t1_cgy47c8,t3_23lap6,null,1433453309,4,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,4

&gt;For all you accused the SNP of sticking their head in the sand earlier, you seem to like that yourself. 

No, I like to go with the evidence. 

&gt;Why would the Guardian make such a story up? 

Because they're a newspaper? Why does Jan Moir print her nonsense? To get people to read it. That's the job, it's not a public service. I don't have a lot of faith in any of them, except perhaps the FT. They have all been guilty of shocking ""errors"" in the past, and politicians in particular use the newspapers to further their own aims through anonymous briefings. 

&gt;And if you actually read the story, you would see that it is someone with an important role in the campaign. 

So who is it then? 

&gt;Which kind of rules out your fantastic transport minister suggestion. 

Why? Who are the ministers who have an important role, and who are the ones who don't? 

&gt;So either they're telling the truth, and a currency union is a possibility, or someone integral to the campaign is lying to undermine it - which gives you great confidence in everything that the No campaign are saying, doesn't it?

I'd say the options are 

1) that the guardian has been misleading in it's reporting to produce a story that it knows will have a sensational impact. Like the very best impact stories it is unverifiable. Even the source, if there is one, can't come out and deny it. 

2) a minister has briefed against the governments stated position. This may be because they are a Scottish minister who would like independence and doesn't agree with the governments position, or because they are an rUK minister who thinks their/their parties position would be enhanced by a Yes vote. 

Of course a currency union is ""possible"". Scotland adopting the ruble is ""possible"". The question is is it likely? On the one hand you've got an anonymous unverifiable newspaper source. On the other you've got publicly stated positions of all major parties which also concurs with rUK public opinion. 

Yet you seem to think the anonymous source carries the most weight in this argument. It's just confirmation-bias at it's worst. There is no credible reason to believe a currency union will happen, and plenty of evidence to suggest it won't, yet the SNP position is ""oh, after a yes vote it will all be different, they'll all agree with what we want, you'll see"".

&gt;When the same sample was asked the follow-up question ‘Are you religious?’, only 29% of the same people said ‘Yes’ while 65% said ‘No’, meaning over half of those whom the census would count as having a religion said they were not religious.

In terms of play, he is a bit of an odd one- decent change of pace and loves to take players on but doesn't really have the flat track speed of a traditional winger. His footwork is tricky and pretty interesting, his passing and linkup is actually surprisingly good for a young kid- if I had to pick a *superstar* type player (even if it was tongue in cheek), that he reminds me of... I guess Zidane is the closest- but that is only because I can't think of anyone better. 

He could turn out great, or he could be another Femi Orenuga, it is so hard to say with such young players. From the little I have seen of them both, I think that Ryan Ledson has more potential to be great. He is a very smart player, even at... 16?

true,RainIsAGoodThing,null,null,"Surely the 'most qualified person' has become the most qualified by being born into the right circumstances in the first place.  It's no secret that those born into poverty perform less well at school and are therefore less likely to be the 'most qualified person', or that those who go to Eton perform better and are more able to gain qualifications.  That is presuming that the only qualifications taken into account are objective ones, but if they are not only judged on objective measures is it really a meritocracy?  And even by objective standards, the most qualified person may not be the best able to do the job, which is why subjective measures are employed when hiring people.  Is it wrong to employ someone who is less qualified than another applicant because you feel you would be better able to work with them?

Now, I understand that in a truly meritocratic society we wouldn't have to worry about circumstance affecting peoples ability to gain qualifications, as the opportunities to gain those qualifications would be based on ability, not family wealth, but, given that we have limited educational resources and not everyone would be able to have the same resources, is it right to base it on innate ability?  And how do you measure that?  Is it really fair that someone be denied the same opportunities because they are not as innately intelligent as someone else?  Does that not punish people for being born unintelligent?  And what do we do with those that can't work?

Dude, what?  That isn't said or suggested at all in /u/JordFord 's post.  Those are your words and I have no clue how you could possibly extract that idea out of OP's post.  He's very simply pointing out that this isn't the first time nor is it a particularly rare occurrence that Lucas has given up a foul in a dangerous area towards the end of a match like this. It's frustrating to watch when it happens and he's not wrong.  Lucas commits a a fair few fouls close to the box and they can be really dangerous.  Most of the time it's fine and he had to go in on the challenge so no big deal, but there are certainly a fair few instances like this one where it's completely unnecessary.  We had a man there and he was stuck in then Lucas just barges the Norwich player over out of nowhere.  Insanely frustrating and totally avoidable foul.

We're not crying for Lucas's head or saying he's one dimensional or not good enough.  He had a tough go of things a bit in the Norwich game but we all obviously know his quality and he's only just coming back in from an injury now.  He'll get himself sorted out and kick on brilliantly just as he always has.

I personally think that no true scientist can make that claim. We simply don't have enough evidence (in fact, we have zero evidence) to state that there is or is not a ""higher power"" in the universe.

Although I was raised in a Jewish household, I don't believe in the Abrahamic god (Yahweh).

true,amoryamory,null,null,"Not to draw any attention from the excellent answers given by /u/mishagale or others, but there was *a* Civil Rights Movement in the UK that's often forgotten about.

In Northern Ireland in the early '50s, many Catholics were increasingly vocal about the various injustices they suffered. They were *de facto* discriminated against in voting, housing, jobs and so on. When my grandfather left Northern Ireland in the '50s, most Catholics were prevented from voting.

It wasn't similar in scale to what occurred in the American South, but it was keenly felt hardship, and the movement drew inspiration from figures of the US Civil Rights Movement. The response by the Protestant-dominated Northern Irish establishment was fairly heavy handed and contributed to a build of sectarian tensions in the region.

This build up of tensions resulting from massacres and community tensions spilled over into something known popularly as the Troubles (I think '69 is the starting year). My mother and her family stopped visiting their relations when the civil war started and didn't really come back until the '90s.

That is--between Friday afternoon and Saturday morning, as many people bought tickets online as had bought tickets *in all the time before that*. There were some judgement calls by the Convention Center security which could have been handled better, but the main issue behind the lines was that everything had been set up anticipating a certain level of pre-sale ticket pickups and a certain level of in-person ticket sales, and at the very last minute reality not only reversed, but also got a lot bigger. Sadly that meant that people who just showed up and bought a ticket Saturday morning actually got in *faster* than people who had pre-purchased them, because there was a bottleneck due to the number of devices available to verify the online purchases, while people who just bought at the door didn't require that verification. 

I think that may have resulted in some volunteers who were the best trained being shifted to outside crowd control, instead of inside line management, which might be why the ones inside didn't know anything about schedules.

I can understand watching the occasional YouTube highlight of those shows. e.g Susan Boyle or the ones where the contestants [chuck a wobbly](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=chuck%20a%20wobbly). I simply couldn't *follow* the show on a weekly basis.

&gt; One genuine question I have is why people find vapid media so offensive? 

That's a good question. I think it boils down to maturity and demographic.  There are people who love the show, people who hate the show but they will talk about it, and people who simply ignore the show (to the best of their ability).

Those shows are an easy target and some people love to hate them. Watching the show is as exciting as hating the show. I think people love to see the failures as much as the successes.

One doesn't always have the option to avoid it. Having it in your face can get annoying and one can find it offensive. e.g. water-cooler/tea-room conversations every day about the latest show can get annoying after a while.

When you go to take your cat to the vet to get a microchip, you MUST insist beforehand that the vet procures the ISO standard chip, and not whatever proprietary chip they use at that particular practice, or else your cat won't pass quarantine.

Good enough reason for me.

I think that street names don't have to follow the same rules of grammar. They are names and words in their own right. So many place names in England have been derived from compound words and misspellings and pronunciations anyway. 

&gt; If you say, ‘we’ll give way on this point, and on this point, and oh this is not really essential,’ it’s a slippery slope,” he says, that has us “going back to grunts.”

I think it's a slippery slope if you apply apostrophes to signs. How far back do you go to correct place names?


e.g. [Swavesey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swavesey) means ""landing place or island of a man named Swaef""

Do you ""fix"" the name to ""Swaef's Sea"" or something similar?

What about all the English place names which are pronounced in the old way and are thus no longer spelled to reflect the ""correct"" pronunciation? e.g. Ely or Wisbech.

true,BuzzsawBrennan,null,null,"Michael Laudrup seems like he would be a good choice. 

I think its important that our next manager was actually a footballer of repute, I just don't think the players were able to respect AVB once the chips were down. With Laudrup we would have a figure the players would be inspired by, and to top it off he's seemingly very personable. 

I don't know much about how Laudrup likes his teams to play, arguably he didn't really put his own unique stamp on Swansea but then again they didn't require that of him. He's been looking for a shot at a big club, and with our options drying up I think we could do far worse.

Moyes, for example, would be another option. Not terribly enthused by that prospect, and whilst I'm all for keeping Tim its worth pointing out I'm only a casual supporter and wouldn't mind seeing Spurs develop long term under a developing manager such as Sherwood. The only thing is, if we keep him we could lose much of the progress that we've made, our players need to play UCL football or they will go, I trust more in Laudrup and Van Gaal to provide that than the other two.
