Here's a list of AO chapters and their locations, there's like 5-6 in the New York City northern New jersey/long Island area. And theres an AO DC. Plus ones in every city in between.

NBA finals might just be ending, but those games shouldn't be on at the same time as the world cup. Just have a look around and do some research!

It makes me believe Muslims are ready to form new religious states inside Britain. If another country invaded us and threatened to take our territory, we'd have a military response to that. There is no material difference between that kind of threat and the threat Muslims face to us by these conspiracies to Islamize whole areas of Britain.

I wouldn't be sad to see Siggy, Livermore and Paulinho gone (though I doubt the latter will because we'll lose money on him unless he has a stellar World Cup).  Bentaleb, for all the division he creates on here, is definitely talented.  The guy's only 19 and has proven himself a solid starter.  I really see him as being our next Walker... a mainstay of the side over the next 4 years (remember, Walker is only 23 himself).

Carroll has the skill set we need, but I imagine he'll probably be loaned again.  Holtby too, depending on what we do in the market (if we sell a few CMs, he'll come back, but if we don't or if we buy a top class midfielder or two, he'll go again).

Chadli, Capoue and Sandro all have a place in the squad, although none are truly world class for me.  Sandro's good, but he doesn't have the distribution of a top CDM.  Other teams aren't exactly knocking our door down to buy him.

Dembele is the most troubling one.  In raw talent, he's good enough to be our next Modric.  But his incisiveness and decision making just aren't there at the moment.  He looks great with the ball at his feet, but enjoys it too much and thus robs us of quick forward movement.  He rarely passes forward between the lines and doesn't recycle possession quickly enough (which is why Bentaleb got so much game time... it's something he does very well).  I'd love to see him rise to be one of the league's great midfielders in the mould of Yaya Toure, but unless his passing, workrate and shooting improve, he won't deliver on his promising skill set.",0,1397918305,null,0,false,0,cgwj4dw,t3_23fod1,t1_cgwj4dw,t3_23fod1,null,1433425948,7,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,7

The thing is, America has a _very_ strong belief that government can't be trusted to run anything. I know Brits joke about our inept politicians, but it's on a different scale in the US. It is, ultimately, the reason why their country exists. When you have such a deep-seated unease about government programs, you naturally wouldn't want them being responsible for keeping you alive. ""Socialism"" is an unbelievably dirty word here.

But it's naïve. The US government, because of the messed-up healthcare situation, already pays more as a % of GDP than most of the countries with various kinds of national healthcare. The country is essentially getting screwed twice - we pay a ton for private insurance, but our taxes are still paying for healthcare anyway!

I think there's also an element of vested interests and it all comes down to lobbying. The health insurance industry is vast, and funds all kinds of politicians and campaigns. They have convinced enough people that if they had socialized healthcare, Obama would personally come and kill you if you were deemed too expensive to keep alive. Fuckups like healthcare.gov and people being kicked off of their own insurance really don't help the perception of government failure.

But, all that said... I think there will be progress in the coming decades. People might be against it now 'just because', but I suspect if someone came along and tried to take away Obamacare now, people would realize it's a better deal for them.

It's still a crappy compromise. Being forced to buy private insurance to exist legally isn't a solution. But the other measures such as not being dropped because you have a long-term illness are clearly an improvement.

I remember as a kid, I watched soccer on the weekends with no idea what was going on.  All I knew was they were long, boring games, but I sat there anyway.  The team that always stuck out to me was Chelsea because they wore blue and Chelsea is a person's name so it was easily memorable.  But I hated soccer because I saw it as a long game of teams kicking a ball around.

In 2012, my roommate and close friend got me to play FIFA 12 with him.  I started to understand the sport better and he eventually got me to start watching soccer.  On FIFA, I played with Chelsea because I remembered them from when I was a kid.  Too bad for my friend because he's a huge Arsenal fan.

I think I started watching at a great time, as I started watching just in time for Roberto Di Matteo to manage us to a FA Cup and Champions League double.

At this time, soccer is now my favourite sport.  Now that I understand what's going on, I'm really fascinated by all the tactics.  I do my best to read up on the history of not just Chelsea, but many clubs and the sport itself.  I have a lot of catching up to do, but I feel I learned enough about Jose Mourinho just before he returned for his second stint at Chelsea.

Following Chelsea has also got me to start learning how to play soccer.  I'm still terrible, and I probably always will be, but I'll try my best.  I find it really cool to see a big turnaround for me when it comes to the sport, from despising it to following it religiously.",0,1397922202,null,0,false,0,cgwkg4c,t3_23eo7y,t1_cgwkg4c,t3_23eo7y,null,1433426573,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

The difference is Mancini well and truly lost the squad. It wasn't just a case of players not bothering since there was nothing to play for, it was that he had alienated much of his squad, as well as the back room staff. All managers have trouble getting players to fight over nothing, but that's not a long term issue, the teams drive will return once they have something to fight for.

Mancini's case was worse than that. Many players actively disliked him, and he had a difficult time controlling them. That's not a matter of poor motivation on their part, that's a matter of poor man-management on his, and t's very difficult to undo. It compromised his ability to lead the squad in the future, and that's why he got sacked. Had he won something more significant that year, the board would likely have been unconvinced that he had lost his ability to lead his squad, but you can't continue winning things like that for long. Eventually it was going to undermine his ability to manage the team, and at that point he would have been sacked. As it happened, the effect this was having on the team was readily apparent, and so they sacked him just he same.

Teaching as the act, and teaching as a profession require different skillsets, aptitudes and levels of education to properly support the development of young people in a way which enables both learning and also healthy development socially and physically. I would personally view teaching professionally as bridging the gap between one who imparts knowledge and a social care professional. 

It does not do for the staff responsible for supporting a statement of special educational need for a child to persist without understanding those frameworks. It is not enough to fail to understand the roles of social services and health professionals working cohesively to ensure good outcomes for children. 

A teacher needs to have an understanding of how to motivate, console, calm and support. They also need to be able to see when their pupils are at risk, and where the line is crossed that requires the intervention of someone more qualified. These are not easy things to do.

When considering the qualified status of teachers it is vitally important to remember what the role consists of, fully and thoroughly.

For example this recent case of the ""Islamic takeover plot"" of a series of schools. Even the language used to describe it is racist. ""A takeover plot"", it makes us sound like evil enemies.

Don't you think your assumption that the Muslim population of Britain will remain relatively unassimilated over time's a touch condescending? Given another thirty years, we'll look back on scaremongering like this and laugh. 

&gt;I don't see what the big deal is about allowing us to have our own muslim areas with our own laws. It is profoundly offensive to see British people disrespecting our values by drinking in public or wearing promiscuous clothing near the mosque. 

Because the UK is a state with its own laws. 

Sharia courts, if all parties agree to abide by them, are perfectly legal- just not binding. Beyond that? Public spaces are just that- *public*. Would you rather that non-Muslim areas ban headscarves because they find the practice offensive? You can't have it both ways. 

&gt;Unfortunately many muslims are afraid of speaking out because we fear violent reprisal from racist groups like UKIP and the EDL. 

Come the fuck off it. The EDL get fucking lynched if they dare to march through Muslim areas. The ""violent reprisals"" that happen get pushed back against by the wider community *hard*. Nobody need feel intimidated to speak out because of those clowns.

true,BritOli,null,null,"As someone who used to be fairly involved in the church, that's not actually all that true. The CoE has many different schools of thought even within itself. At every ""level"" there is a great divide between, essentially liberal and conservative perspectives. It all comes down to what you think the bible is, and how you interpret it. If you take the bible at face value, consistent and purposeful homosexuality is very much off the table. (Romans 1).

There are those on the conservative side, who do take the bible literally (most of which have a more complex definition of literally, which avoids the need to believe in 7 day creation). These guys don't think that homosexuality is worse than another sin, so they're probably very nice to gays, but they still think it's a sin. They also think that marriage was created by God for for a man and a woman. Therefore they a.) don't want to support sexual immorality and b.) don't want to mess with Gods definition of marriage. Finally they c.) believe that the church has a God-given responsibility to the state. Ergo, no gay marriage.

From this, there are then people who think that Christians should not engage in same-sex marriage, but they also think the church has no responsibility for the affairs of the state. Then, there are those who believe same-sex marriage can be ok for Christians in the right circumstances if it helps them to deal with promiscuity, say. Then there are those who don't really think that homosexuality is a sin at all, and frankly any love is God's love.

With this in mind, there's also one more thing that needs to be said. The higher up the CoE you go, the less strong minded, and more theological people you tend to get. Most strong minded vicars want to spend time converting, and teaching - rather than debating and fiddling. Therefore everyone at the top is generally rather ""academic"". They understand the shifts in society, and they generally want the church to keep up.

Now, the thing that these CoE leaders find very, very, very hard is that they have to please the whole CoE. But the members disagree on looooads of stuff - much more pivotal than this I daresay. Given the trend towards a more liberal church, those on the conservative side are increasingly compromised. The church leaders therefore essentially found themselves willing to allow gay marriage, but they wanted to make damn sure that those conservative vicars were protected. Those running the CoE are probably some of the most ""normal"" guys. The issue is that for unity's sake they can't be seen to pander to one group more than another.

TL;DR Some Christians do dislike gay marriage, but not at the top. Most CoE leaders are generally academics, who just want to preserve the unity within the CoE. Therefore they have fought against churches being forced to conduct gay marriage, rather than against the marriage itself.",0,1397925835,null,0,false,0,cgwlva1,t3_23fa8m,t1_cgwlva1,t1_cgwkzpt,null,1433427243,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

Lucas is a fantastic professional and I know that he'll fight for his place.

I believe that next to Hendo, he's our hardest working player. He could work his way into most teams in the world and none of us should forget the stats we've seen over the past 3 years or so: Lucas covers more ground, performs more tackles and passes more accurately than 90% of the other Premier League players.

true,Micros0,null,null,"&gt;Don't you think your assumption that the Muslim population of Britain will remain relatively unassimilated over time's a touch condescending? Given another thirty years, we'll look back on scaremongering like this and laugh.

There are some liberal muslims who want homosexuality and promiscuous women but I can tell you that most of us do not. Most of us in Tower Hamlets come from Pakistan and Bangladesh where the British values of homosexuality etc are considered widely offensive. 

That isn't going to change in 30 years. It is part of our religion.

&gt;Would you rather that non-Muslim areas ban headscarves because they find the practice offensive? You can't have it both ways.

That is why as I say as the muslim population grows this sort of bigotry and racism won't be possible. At the moment we are at 5% and have already got muslims elected. If we manage to reach 20% we will be able to get MPs sympathetic to our beliefs as well as willing to let us have our own culture without being subjected to racism like we currently are.

&gt;Come the fuck off it. The EDL get fucking lynched if they dare to march through Muslim areas. The ""violent reprisals"" that happen get pushed back against by the wider community hard. Nobody need feel intimidated to speak out because of those clowns.

And how about UKIP? They are the 3rd biggest party now despite having a racist, bigoted message. Many of us are scared of what will happen if they gain more power. British people think it is their right to deny us our religion and to deny us our values. Look at how things are spoken about in the press. Just because a few muslim governors wanted to put more muslim teachers in **muslim schools in muslim areas**, that means that it is a ""takeover"" plot?

You say I have a persecution complex yet muslims are constantly subjected to racism and bigotry. As I have said, as our population grows you will hear about this more, because at the moment we are scared to speak out because we fear being sent back to our home countries by racists like UKIP and the EDL.

The British public as a whole still has a problem with racism and we can see that by how unwilling they are to let us have our own Islamic values in OUR areas. There may have been a time when England was populated only by the English but that isn't anymore. We have come here and we deserve to have our culture represented.

The times of England being a majority ""white"" country where you can oppress others are gone. We are here now and our numbers will grow every year. It is only fair that we given equal representation under the law.

It's well commented on in the RoI papers (you can even rule out the Sunday World) especially so in recent years. Why no arrests up here?

37 “Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? 38 When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? 39 When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?’

40 “The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’

41 “Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. 42 For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, 43 I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.’

That doesn't directly answer your question, but if the bulk of Scotland's population live a couple of hours drive away from England then it seems pretty unlikely that postage will be more expensive/supermarkets will charge more/etc.

&gt; That is why as I say as the muslim population grows this sort of bigotry and racism won't be possible. At the moment we are at 5% and have already got muslims elected. If we manage to reach 20% we will be able to get MPs sympathetic to our beliefs as well as willing to let us have our own culture without being subjected to racism like we currently are.

People not pandering to your bigoted opinions is emphatically *not* racism- and you devalue the term by appropriating it in such a way. 

&gt;And how about UKIP? They are the 3rd biggest party now despite having a racist, bigoted message. 

UKIP's message, and most of its voter base, aren't racist. Idiotic, backwards and unelectable, certainly- but not racist. 

They're not about to gain any serious power. 

&gt;You say I have a persecution complex yet muslims are constantly subjected to racism and bigotry. As I have said, as our population grows you will hear about this more, because at the moment we are scared to speak out because we fear being sent back to our home countries by racists like UKIP and the EDL.

&gt;The British public as a whole still has a problem with racism and we can see that by how unwilling they are to let us have our own Islamic values in OUR areas. There may have been a time when England was populated only by the English but that isn't anymore. We have come here and we deserve to have our culture represented.

&gt;The times of England being a majority ""white"" country where you can oppress others are gone. We are here now and our numbers will grow every year. It is only fair that we given equal representation under the law.

Lots of people, for example, assume we're employed by and run from hospitals where we're actually independent NHS Trusts stationed in much the same way as the fire service. 

Likewise there's a general lack of understanding of what we are as ambulance personnel. Both registered healthcare professionals (paramedics, sometimes nurses and doctors) and non-registered healthcare workers (Technicians of different levels, A&amp;E Support staff, Emergency care support workers etc differing by Trust) work on frontline ambulance services.

Paramedicine is relatively new to the UK, with registration only beginning formally in 2000. Before that skills and skillsets were highly variable, and so there remains a lot of misunderstanding about what we are.

Frankly, a lot of what we do constitutes neither and accident or an emergency. We're often effectively a taxi for people who're not that ill because in terms of drug administration we're limited in scope to those which make a big difference in trauma or significant medical emergencies (seizures, anaphylaxis, sepsis etc.) It's difficult for us to be the best that we can be with someone who doesn't really need us to begin with. You sound like you really did though, so perhaps that's why they shone for you :P

We're pre-hospital acute and emergency care specialists. We exist to recognise when someone is in need of immediate advanced life support, when they might be dying or seriously unwell and is therefore in need of emergency care. We're also there to provide the first stage of that care. It's our hope that we can do everything that we can to help people on the worst day of their lives and to make sure that it's not the last day.

true,Matt-SW,null,null,"It's a non-issue. I'm all for raising speed limits ***on roads where there are rarely, if ever, pedestrians***, as I honestly don't believe that speed is all that harmful (obviously within reason).

I honestly don't understand why there is just so much fuss around speed. If you read the full accident/fatalities statistics from the DfT, speed is actually fairly low down on the contributory factors. Yes, accidents where speed was the major factor carry more fatalities, but the main ones are:

 - Failing to look properly

 - ""careless, reckless or in a hurry""

 - Failed to judge other person’s path or speed

 - Poor turn or manoeuvre

 - Exceeding Speed Limit

 - Driving too fast for conditions

 - Failed to judge other person’s path or speed

Out of 118,000 accidents reported in 2011-2012, 28,000 was down to 'injudicious action,' which covers all things such as speeding, jumping lights, entering wrong roads, etc. In fact, both exceeding the speed limit and driving too fast for conditions only totalled about 13,000, which is less than one percent of all UK road accidents in that year.

We need much more emphasis on fucking cretins who can't look or indicate properly, or people who make stupid decisions (not related to speed) such as stupid overtaking, squeezing through gaps and rushing out at roundabouts and junctions, rather than big yellow boxes on posts that do nothing but generate money and make people uncomfortable and on edge.

I have mix of costumes across different genres - Star Wars Jedi &amp; Leia, Doctor Who Osgood &amp; River Song, Pirate's of the Caribbean's Angelica, Ghostbuster, Stargate Goa'uld &amp; starting a Black Widow! 

I'd recommend to pick one you like either because you love the show and want to take part in a way or you just like the costume cause it looks interesting or suits your body shape.

Budget wise you can spend 10's, 100's or 1000's of pounds depending on the costume and how accurate you want it to be and also if you plan to join a costuming group (some have a costume focus and expect top level accuracy so expect to spent plenty or some have a charity focus and as such look for more ""good recognisable"" level accuracy and can be cheaper).

I'm in a charity group who do lots of collections in the area - we go with a guide that if a member of the public can recognise who you are and it's not just ""fancy dress"" level then it's good for us.

If you can sew or build props then you can save money but a lot of things can be found of eBay!

As for where to wear costumes there are several good convension type events close by that welcome costumers (some even have contests with prizes) - there's normally an entry fee (varys from £3-15ish). I'll be a most of these this summer.

* [Charity SciFi Family Fun Day](https://sites.google.com/site/charityscifiuk/annual-family-funday) on 26th April - more of a family event than a full convention but we would welcome any costumers
* [Bristol Expo](http://www.bristolexpo.co.uk/) on 10-11th May
* [MCM Comic Con London](http://www.mcmcomiccon.com/london/) in 24-25th May - big con with lots of guests and shops
* [London Film and Comic Con](http://www.londonfilmandcomiccon.com/) on 12-13th July - big con with lots of guests and shops
* [Melksham comic con](http://www.melkshamcomiccon.com/) on Aug 30th - 31st - again smaller con but still fun
* [Cardiff Film and Comic Con](http://www.cardiffcomiccon.com/) on 8th &amp; 9th Nov - the closest ""big"" convention and is very recommended!

Hmm... I ramble a lot! If you want more specific advice then let me know what you're into and your budget and I can point you in the right direction :-D ",0,1397930957,null,0,false,0,cgwo12g,t3_23bqvr,t1_cgwo12g,t1_cgwktyo,null,1433428261,1,false,bristol,t5_2r52c,1

1. Who was organizing our corner defense on their first goal? Acres of space at the top of the box.

2. This summer our entire team needs some finishing training.

3. Mike Dean is awful. Horrible calls (mainly omissions) all game against both sides. Johnson should have been off. Rami should have been off. Willian's cross at the byline was blocked by an arm. Etc. 

4. Our pitch caused a lot of slips today, what's up with that? 

5. Time to focus all of our efforts on the CL, here's hoping Torres has a big game in Spain.

true,julio1990,MX,mexico,"**BEFORE** anyone starts blaming the Ref Mike Dean (Cunt) Let's take a hard look at how the team played. Sunderland was NEVER going to be an easy team not even at the Bridge. Did you guys forget what they did to Manchester City at the Etihad midweek? Now Chelsea recently in the Premiere league have been great against top team but against lower table teams we have played horrible and I mean horrible yet Many of us complain Oh it was Chris Foy, Mike Dean, Clattenburg...etc. We canno't blame the refs every single time we lose a game. If we were to finish the chances we had  in the beginning of the game then we could have finished the game soon. But enough of this blaming the Ref every single loss. We learn from this game, we pick ourselves up and move on to Atletico and Then away to Liverpool.

As we saw Midweek and Today no game is guaranteed, Liverpool still have to play 4 more games and all those 4 game will be hard for them as well. But seriously I'm sad that we lost today and Mourinho's home record has an ""L"" next to the Home record but the pressure is off of him now. Come on lads let's not get down on the dumps we still have a very important game Tuesday. 

Edit: I still think Mike Dean is a Cunt!

No one can own the wind or the sun, unfortunately in the real world, to utilise those you need land. So we'd have to rent the space off the rich landowners. So they'd get richer still. Don't think he's thought that one through.I always remember being stopped in Manchester by a Greenpeace member. I asked him why he/they opposed a new 'clean' coal plant in the south. He replied because coal is bad. I then countered, but it's to replace an old dirty station, it would lower emissions. He just couldn't grasp that fact. Fossil fuels are just bad.Unfortunately we need then, wind is useless, and always needs a backup, unless brownouts are your thing. Solar needs more room than we have. Hydro could work but we don't really have the rivers for the amount we need.

true,HRHSirGideonOsborne,null,null,"&gt; AFAIK, Christian teaching is not that Jesus came to Earth to bring aid to the poor, but rather to bring a message about spiritual salvation.

I think in this context spiritual salvation is the attitude of forsaking material property (I.e. money) and focusing on personal and social harmony. There's a Chinese Koan (spelling?) in which a young Buddhist monk is shown some teachings of Christ. In particular, he reads a passage quoted earlier in the thread about ""the fowls of the air... and the lillies of the field"". The monk states that ""I do not know this Jesus but from his words he seems close to Buddha."".

I'm paraphrasing, but I always got the feeling that Jesus was just a hippy scholar who travelled and learned and in the context of the time wanted everyone to just get along. Over time obviously, his message has been twisted, translated, retranslated, truncated and embellished to suit whoever was in charge but the underlying theme is one of a smart, audacious homeless dude who saw material lust as getting in the way of enlightenment.",0,1397932542,null,0,false,0,cgwoq70,t3_23fa8m,t1_cgwoq70,t1_cgwhxm0,null,1433428590,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Glasscastle9,null,null,"My thoughts on certain players that seem to be getting undeserved love/hate...

I think the unfortunate fact that not many spurs fans seem to be addressing is the lingering injury issues with Dembele and Sandro. We bought Dembele from Fulham with a bad hip, which has worsened, and Sandro -- though I love him -- is a different player now from the one who amazed during the champs league and shined last season. I sincerely hope he returns to that same form, but that's by no means a lock and we haven't seen it this season so far. 

Capoue needs to stay for us to really see what he can do given he's missed 50% of our games this year. Before he started complaining, his performances in the early part of the season and Europa league were impressive -- crystal palace, Newcastle, arsenal, etc.

Carroll needs experience and game time. A loan to a better PL club than QPR would be ideal. 

Holtby has been an enigma, but is young and I think is needed for depth. In time, he could blossom. His performances for Fulham have shown he has quality, but our level play may ultimately be beyond him. Time will tell. 

Lamela, like Capoue, can't be judged. He needs another season and some stability on the managerial side before we can decide. 

Paulinho has had an up and down season, but has genuine quality. Remember his play just prior to the Charlie Adam challenge when he had a steady run of games and was playing in a more natural one for him that he occupies with Brazil. 

Confidence is such a huge element of playing well for all of these guys, and given how challenging this season has been on so many levels, I think it's unfair to say some of our new players should be sold under such a small sample size. 

Overall, I don't think we have room to cut, aside from guys like Livermore -- who is probably 3rd choice to healthy Sandro/Capoue, and maybe even Bentaleb -- and Lennon, who for me has probably regressed the most from last season to this one. Love him, but not nearly as effective having lost a step. 

Call me crazy, but with a new manager, a consistent system of play, and better overall team dynamic, the ideal 3 man midfield could be Capoue, Eriksen, Paulinho next season.

Love to hear any arguments for/against the above. ",0,1397932659,null,0,false,0,cgwos2c,t3_23fod1,t1_cgwos2c,t3_23fod1,null,1433428614,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

But it would only matter if City goes on to win all of their matches now.

Goal difference wouldn't be too much of a bother because a Liverpool loss against Chelsea would put them at +50. A minimal win for City on all the matches would put us at +59. Pumping in 9 goals in 3 matches might not be all that easy. Especially since they play Crystal Palace at their home. Palace has been the clean sheet specialists this season and let's see how that goes.

Anyway, all I can hope and pray for would be a City win in the remainder of the season.

This is basic people management 101, and it's practiced in any professional setting. Just because its football, or because he is Sherwood, doesn't mean he should talk like this. 

If he does this to Sandro, what do you think will happen to other players that he doesn't like that are big attractions to other clubs? One thing is to have a feud with one player... but to alienate a majority of the squad? That's not how you manage the team, and the majority of fans are right to be fed up with his way of running things. At this point, as bad as the summer went, I'd be happier keeping Baldini and letting Sherwood go to another club.

Also, I don't give a shit what r/soccer thinks. Every time I see them laugh at a Spurs fan, it's because they are saying something stupid like ""Sherwood will be the next Guardiola"" or ""Adebayor is awesome, never inconsistent"".

The problem is that when we have to play tight, we either have no one that can finish, or Willian/Hazard holds the ball waiting for something to happen and by that time there's no space to do anything. Having a good striker or not, the way we attack leading to trying to score is hampering chances because of all the stopping. Or we end up with a cross into a congested box from Ivanovic that is either blocked from the get go or taken care of by defenders.

If you look at the way other teams play, like Liverpool for instance, they will always make runs into the box without holding up, making the defenders unstable which open up gaps for them to shoot.

true,norney,null,null,"In the South East £12/h is what a large company or agency will pay. Your qualification will allow you access to that and no more. 

Smaller companies may be more likely to recognise your individual level of skill and your value to their organisation. My small company will pay £12/h to start for e.g. a carpenter and then up to £18.75/h if you're multi-skilled and shit-hot all round. To my understanding of exchange rates you're toward the higher end of that range, although I have no comparison of your cost of living. 

If you're self-employed and can do a wide range of work then you can charge yourself out as a subcontractor or directly to customers at even more than £18.75/h.  There are no serious barriers to setting up your own business as long as you have the right to work here. 

As others have pointed out, there can also be large variations in rates in different parts of the country and between different trades. Average salary in the UK is ~£26k which equates to a [smidge over £12/h](http://www.thesalarycalculator.co.uk/salary.php). It's perfectly liveable in some parts of the country, and dire poverty in others. £18.75/h equates to a good salary in most parts of the country. 

TL;DR it depends. 

EDIT: it's worth pointing out that many employers here may not recognise or have any idea about your journeyman status beyond the fact that you are for example a 'carpenter' as opposed to a 'shit hot carpenter', if that is indeed what it means.

Renewables do not even come close, we only get 5% of our power this way. Wind turbines are way too inefficient ( they run at about 1/4  to a 1/3 of their rated capacity ) we'd have to build thousands of them everywhere and to build enough offshore turbines would take us decades and we haven't even really started. 

We should have invested heavily in Nuclear in the 90's. We're only just starting to commission new plants now ( from the French )  Carbon capture technology on that scale doesn't even exist yet and to implement it would push our bills to an astronomical level. If indeed it would actually work.

good question. the answer is: because the entire FA apparatus and the commentary/analyst network consists of ex-liverpool players. there's at the very least an implicit bias towards liverpool among the football establishment in the UK, this is not particularly controversial.

You alienate people when you call into question their capacity to do their job in public. It's common sense stuff that anyone would tell you they've experienced in any job. If you were at a meeting and your manager said he ""didn't think you were good enough right now"" to take on a new project in front of other people, you would feel alienated.

Thinking that a free market = a less regulated market means you don't understand what a free market is.  In fact, regulation is absolutely necessary to maintain a free market.  Any sensible liberal would argue, for example, that there should be regulation to prevent predatory pricing.  Otherwise, incumbents could run a temporary loss to lock out competitors.  That would not a free market.

I could go on to argue that nothing in that picture is actually liberal/libertarian; it's blatantly anarchist.  Liberals are minarchists by definition - because liberals believe that any population will form groups for mutual protection and regulation - agreements between small groups would then lead to governments.  

A further specific example is that he is paid little, presumably because there is ""wage fixing"" by his employer, otherwise he could leave for a better paying job; also policing costs about £150 per person per year - and in a  model where you'd pay for protection you'd pay by subscription - that's how governments work and that's how the mafia work.  Deregulation of markets beyond a point will stop them from being truly free - in fact the in the totally unregulated (anarchist) scenario depicted in your picture, the character is **not** ""free"".

I don't really get the hate that Everton fans hold against him.

I understand how the comments could have pissed you guys off initially, but you have to remember he was just doing his job as the United manager to try and acquire two quality players who fit his system. I'd have a hard time believing he genuinely meant what he said. Besides, since then he's been constantly praising Everton and your fans support over the years in the build up to this match and complementing Martinez and his work, with literally zero hostility involved. Sure he hit a ceiling with you guys, but it's not a reason to hate him. He took you from relegation candidates to a solid upper mid-table side. You shouldn't hate Moyes for not achieving more, you should be thanking him for his work and adore Martinez for taking you to the next level. It confuses me that fans are prepared to boo him purely for doing his job, you may not have liked it but that's because it was aimed at you. It happens all the time when clubs offer low initially.

I am entirely aware of the different extremes of libertarianism. I am aware of what a free market is.

He had said something along the lines of:

""Surely a free-market dystopia is more along the lines of conservatism.""

I pointed him towards the fact that the concept of a free-market is more often associated with the extremes of libertarianism and anarcho-capitalism, than it is with conservatism in general. 

Considering the original discussion was about the ""Reddit party"", which obviously doesn't exist, but the consensus seems to be that if we were to make fun of it, it would probably an anarcho-capitalist party, because that's what the anti-circlejerk on Reddit is against. 

I am not sure what you are arguing against. You seem to have mistaken me for implying something I'm not implying, because the comment above me is deleted - which is understandable.

From what I've gathered, you've linked my simplified description of fiscal conservatism (which you have more or less explained why it is accurate) to me saying the greentext in question describes a situation where typical extreme libertarian Redditors get their way and implied I know nothing about economics.

Sherwood took over the team at a time of crisis, he did some positive things (restoring Ade to the squad, removing the restrictions on how we play on the pitch, started utilizing the youth) and got some results, his ""passion"" was seen to be a breath of fresh air.

As the matches progressed flaws began to become more visible, he didn't prepare and didn't seem to prepare the squad (Liverpool), his tactics have often been questionable, his squad rotation poor (though to be fair injuries also contributed), locker room discontent has bubbled up (the club house blowups after the matches) and players seem to be dialling out on his methods and strategy (Jan's season was not fantastic but his form noticeably dipped further once Tim took over, Sandro's twitter comment today), and then his media presence.

His media presence seems to be driving a great deal of the blowback, and i think rightfully so.  Some say his being candid is refreshing, but when you look at his comments a great number of them seem to be self serrving and detrimental.  He openly questioned the squad and stated that they ""capitulated"" during Chelsea yet he took none of the blame himself for mistakes that were made (at least AVB took the ""we is us"" route). During LFC he sat in the crowd and afterwards stated the reason was that he ""couldn't impact the game"" from the technical box. He continually criticizes players and simply sounds like he doesn't think before he speaks.

To me i think some of this impact is because he never finished his badges, people think that getting the coaching badges is all about understanding tactics but a great deal of the courses deal with how to deal with the media, how to deal with agents, how to deal with owners and how to deal with multimillionare players. These are comprehensive courses that are meant to prepare someone to be a manager at the top level beyond just tactics. Tim would have gotten a great deal of use out of finishing his badges. Some of this is just purely not being a particularly savy individual and some of it appears to be not taking advice from other managers (by his own admission other managers contacted him with advice of how to deal with the media, the other managers apparently included Wenger and Rodgers incidentally).

What you are seeing in the ""Sherwood Out"" sentimentality is frustration and fear. People are frustrated because a promising season has fallen apart and Sherwood's appointment and subsequent time in charge catch the brunt of the focus at the moment. People are fearful that Sherwood's influence will drive our best players away from the club and undo the progress that has been made.  I even know several season ticket holders and numerous club members who don't want to renew unless Sherwood is gone because they believe that ""voting with their wallet"" is the best way to express frustration and embarrassment over not just the Sherwood situation but the management situation as a whole.

Is ""Sherwood Out"" taking it a bit too far  (especially with 3 games left before he is sacked)?...yes, but i can understand the sentiment even if i don't fully agree with it.

How is this embarrassing? These referees are getting away with murder as if they have some sort of divine right to what they do.

It's exactly this type of attitude which makes them think they can get away with bold and ridiculous decisions. Something has to change. A grown man like Rui Faria doesnt behave like that for no reason.

If people dont start addressing the bad calls made by refs, nothing will ever change. How easily could this situation have been avoided had there just been a quick replay by the fourth official?

Your being ""Scottish"" is meaningless really. If you live there some things are different (a few laws, etc) but that changes if you move to another part of the UK. Move outside the UK, and you'll be British (though they may annoyingly interchange that with ""English"" for which I genuinely apologise, because England is not and has never been the sum of what it means to be British). 

I find the rise in petty nationalism rather sad (it's even more ugly in England than it is in Scotland), but it's hard to get rid of. People like to divide themselves up into tribes, like to blame others down the road or say things would be better if we got rid of x. All nationalistic movements are basically the same, blame your woes on those over the hill, and promise how brilliant things will be without them.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"Yeah, I had the same problem getting through *The Pandorica Opens/The Big Bang*, and later the Series Six opening *The Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon*.

The troubling thing is, both are really great stories in a lot of ways. *Pandorica/Bang* is incredibly fun and despite having a lot of dramatic moments of utter despair doesn't forget to have fun and give great goofy character interactions alongside all the tearful goodbyes and self-sacrifices. *Astronaut/Moon* chose an amazing setting and nails the visual aesthetic down pat. Add a absolutely phenomenal new monster design and a shocking central mystery and there's so much potential there.

But you're right. There are serious issues with both two-parters that make them very hard to stomach. I go into depth on [**all the issues with *Pandorica/Bang* here**](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/rq0xj/indepth_discussion_of_the_pandorica_opensthe_big/), and have spoken a few times on all of the issues in the Series Six premiere elsewhere.

The bottom line is that both episodes try and pack an awful lot into just two episodes, and while there should be ample space to work in, things end up getting rushed or overlooked entirely. It's the reason why we have the excellent concept of the Doctor detained at Area 51 introduced and resolved in the first five minutes of *Day of the Moon*. It's the reason why we have the Doctor make a ***really*** immoral decision at the end of the Series Six two-parter, and yet get no reflection on it.

I don't have a whole lot of time to really delve into my thoughts on the episodes right yet, but I'll respond to any replies when I can get to them.

So not much change in ping or upload speed, but a fair reduction in download speed. But I haven't tested all the different server locations, some are faster than others (you can do a speed test on EarthVPN's website for each server to get an idea of which would be best for you).

Wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey.

Don't take the show so seriously, especially when the show doesn't take itself seriously.  While most other sci-fi franchises that have a significant time travel element (including Trek) try to present it with some logic and gravitas, the fact is that if you look at the big picture, the logic holds up just about as well as Doctor Who's does--rules are broken, what works here doesn't work there, causality is important except when it isn't, this one loops, this one breaks off into an alternate timeline.   Ultimately, though, it's just another story, and as long as the logic holds within the episode/arc itself, it doesn't matter that the following episode does something that might contradict what was previously established.  Doctor Who is unique in that it helps all that go over by coating everything with irreverence and wackiness and fun.  You can't deal with an episode/arc/season/companion/doctor?

And if Brits do nothing about Islam, and if it turned out Islam can't be bargained with, can't be appeased, can't be reformed, because it's just too far stuck in a medieval mindset - it could be too late to win that civil war, even if the military were brought in.",0,1397941731,null,0,false,0,cgwsks3,t3_23f9g7,t1_cgwsks3,t1_cgwlhrp,null,1433430471,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

true,maybelying,null,null,"&gt;The show has always been pretty fantastical of course, but it felt as though that finale was having a rapid fire one-upping contest with itself.

This is a pattern with Steven Moffat's finales since taking over.  He starts each season with ambitious story arcs and then often winds up having to cram the solution into an episode that just can't quite contain it.  Sometimes his creativity pays off, sometimes he's just being too clever for the sake of it and winds up sending fans to the internet to try and figure out what the hell happened.

&gt;When I can't take a character's death or the end of the universe seriously, I feel as though I've reached a serious crossroads with the narrative. Time travel is a touchy concept after all, and if the show intends to abuse it for maximum plot fuel I just don't know if I should really go on.

This has been my biggest criticism of 11's run.  I lost the emotional connection I had with the Doctor and his companions.  The universe they now exist in feels superficial and void of consequence, so it has become really difficult to give a damn about the characters.  I also feel that the use of time as a story contrivance has been overdone at this point, to the point where it's beginning to feel like everything can always be wrapped up with a bit of wibbly-wobbly

&gt;I've tried on around a half dozen occasions to watch The Impossible Astronaut but it starts to feel like it was written as fan fiction and I have to quit every time.

Again, agree completely, I've referenced Moffat's characterization of the Doctor as seeming like a work of fan fiction before, where all of his strengths are greatly exaggerated without enough emphasis on flaws or weaknesses to offset them.  Eleven feels like Superman, whereas previous Doctors felt more like Batman.  Everybody loves Superman, but Batman is invariably more interesting to watch.  

 It is worth noting that Moffat is a life time Doctor Who fan and did participate in Usenet discussions and debates before the reboot even happened, so there is an element of fan fic there.

Having said all that, don't give up on it.  Just learn to roll your eyes through the troublesome spots.  While I may not like the way the Eleventh is characterized, Matt Smith is brilliant in the way he portrays him and does only get better.  There are some very good episodes that offset the meh ones.  You just kind of have to sort of change your frame of mind to enjoy it, but it's still worth it.",0,1397942190,null,0,false,0,cgwsrhy,t3_23gls5,t1_cgwsrhy,t3_23gls5,null,1433430559,12,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,12

He thinks he's deflecting attention and playing mind games is going to help him and his team, butttt its not. His persona only works when he wins silverware. Fans will slowly start to turn on him if he keeps this persona up and not win much. 

One of the things that won me over with Rodgers straight away was his honesty. Whenever he fucked up, he was the first to say it. This is how you win your fans and start to become one unit, one club. Not this Jose shit where he tells the fans/public/press one thing and his players another. Anyone with half a brain can sure as shit tell that the public comments he makes are not the ones he tells his players. As I fan I don't want to be disconnected from the players I support. I want to be certain that when we play like shit, the manager is there telling the players the hard truth of the matter.

Jose is not apologizing to the fans as he and his team let them down. Those performances against Sunderland, Palace and Villa were not good enough, simple as that. Certainly not good enough to challenge for the title. The idiotic Chelsea fans, which seem to be the majority, are lapping Jose's shit up when they don't know how quickly they'll be turned off by his persona when Chelsea don't win anything.

Back in December I had a case of full blow optimism.  It was brought on, most likely, by my Americanism.  Before the Man City match my fiancee was talking with her parents back home (who are lifelong Liverpool fans and the reason I'm here right now) and they asked her if I would be, ""very upset if Liverpool didn't win the league.""

As much as I want to jump on the high-five train and avoid any negativity in this sub I think we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves.  And I don't think we should downvote posts just because they aren't full of assurances.

After tonight's result in the Chelsea match it's so tempting to shout out the call of my favorite NFL team - the 49ers - [""Who's got it better than us?  NOBODY!""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnM71lPer5g)

But they managed to let it slip...3 times...3 turnovers...against their rivals...and lost it.

A rare case but if you get a rejection email it's worth chasing up and asking more - though this was a very small company so could be a bit different. In terms of just asking how the interview went without having heard from them I wouldn't do so as it seems a bit pushy (unless you got on really well with them).

I think it really depends on the size of the company - smaller ones are more likely to remember you and appreciate the phone call as it shows you're not just another recruit.

Norwich will surely go for the win, remember that old saying? A rat fights it's hardest when it's fighting for it's own life.

Suarez is due a goal and he'll be facing his favorite target, time to produce some magic again Luis! I also feel we could very well get to own the flanks in this match, Sterling and Coutinho should get every chance to produce something from out wide. Lucas and Allen will need to be mindful, I firmly believe the midfield is where the opponent has the most quality and they'll have to be very mindful. Sakho and Škrtel should be more than able to deal with the threat from their forward line, I sincerely wish for a perfect game from our back four.

This is a game where Rodgers should be picking a tried and tested recipe and unleash our attacking force. 4-3-3 vs. a team that needs points ... I see very little point in setting up a diamond, I feel it would limit our approach play too much. That's just my two cents worth, I'm sure the team will be ready and Brendan will have prepared them as best as possible. I'm confident, yet slightly anxious. Since I follow Liverpool (coming up on ten years) we've never really been this close to the title.

The big question is ""what would make that happen""?  This isn't the 19th Century anymore, land ownership in and of itself isn't the one and only measure of status and power.  Harking back to distant times of the landed minority is a invalid analogy.

To cut a long post short: for renting to become the norm, permanently, it would require two contradictory things:

* for renting long-term to be cheaper than buying (it already is for short-to-medium term ~ 10 years depending on which part of the country and what type of properties).  If this wasn't the case then enterprising financiers would invent mortgage schemes.

* for landlords to both: a) continue to buy properties to let, and b) not sell properties they do currently own.  Why would they stop buying and/or start selling, you may ask, well because if my first point were true then the return-on-investment in property would be unappealing compared with other investment classes elsewhere.

There's no evidence that either of those two things are happening, or are going to happen.  Buying is still cheaper than renting long-term (greater than 15 years, well within the range of standard mortgages), and the growth of the landlord classes is fueled by a cheap credit flood, hence keeping ROI in (just) positive territory.

But both of the above two things are at stretching point, and any interest rate rises next year will actually finally put them to the test.  Then we can see really what's what.

(Not that there's not a housing crisis, as there obviously is, and it's a national scandal.  But what we're seeing is classic politicking and blame-shifting, not an unavoidable return to feudal society.)

I have a 19 year old midfielder, a bevy of young, talented wingers, an underachieving CM who's just good on the dribble, and an absurdly talented #10 who's been winning us games form the last month, and plays the underachiever as a winger (Dembele), the 19 year old CM in his preferred position (Bentaleb), one of the wingers consistently out of position (Chadli), and sits the #10 (Eriksen) and other wingers (Andros, Lamela, Chadli for the first few weeks) on a regular basis, and plays Eriksen out of position *in front of an out of position fullback* until two weeks ago, I have every right to be saying Sherwood out.

I feel very strongly that we've been winning *in spite* of Sherwood, not because of them. There was a stretch of games where he got beaten by the *exact* same tactics several games running (The Dnipro game was the first; team played narrow, gave up the wings, let us just hurl ineffective crosses in), and Eriksen and Adebayor bailed us by with two or three transcendent plays.) and made absolutely no changes.

The fact of the matter is, since he got in, he's done nothing but make laughable personnel decisions (hey, let's alienate Nacer, in january who it turns out is pretty good! And let's play a 19 year old over Paulinho who, as it turns out, is pretty good too!) and show a general lack of any thought behind tactical decisions (playing established internationals out of position to make room for Nabil in midfield, or trying to play long-ball football towards 5-10 Soldado on the few occasions he's actually played). 

I don't hate Sherwood as a person. I don't even hate him as a talent evaluator, he clearly has a good eye for players.

Westwood: Controlled the middle of the pitch very well for Villa. Started poorly, but improved as the half went on. Made some important defensive clearances and spread the ball well in attack. Some passes were sublime.

El Anmadi: I though he played well, got into advanced positions and was theat. In fact, I'd argue he was a greater threat in attack than Weimann and Agnonlahor!

Robinson: This kid has a future, he played 8 minutes yesterday but he always wanted the ball and got into some fantastic positions. Even the commentators were quite surprised by his performance on his debut. With Cowans as assistant manager,  I think we will see more of him.

I'm not against them for doing that on a personal level, every man wants to do whats best for him, so I fully understand them doing that and salute them in public for coming to the UK to better themselves. 

However, this system shouldn't be in place. Local tradesmen here getting undercut shouldn't be a thing that happens. The EU is detrimental to us on so many levels, you couuld move here if we set up an open borders system of immigration with Canada, which, outside of the EU we could do legally and our politicians being a little bit tougher and saying to Canada 'ENGLAND IS HERE FOR YOUR CITIZENS', would be a hell of a lot more 2 way, like we are with Australia. 

We know your citizens and our citizens like eachother.. and a system should be set up for this, but we're bound EU law... it's such a fucked up situation. 

To be honest, as three nations who would indeed stand together and just want to get on with our lives, instead we have Romania and Bulgaria and poor Eastern European nations able to send their unskilled members of society here who CAN claim benefits as soon as they get here, without any work visa required.. personally I think this is madness, would much rather people like you had an easier time...

To explain this to normal people of the UK, and what party will support easier commonwealth migration (while focusing on India in a different regard) - or setting tariff's on each country, UKip is the only party that will do this. It's seriously about time they changed their name to United Kingdom Internationalist Party. So that guys like you can move here, and our tradesmen can move to Canada as per the same regulations.. our tradesmen would probably make more money if I'm honest. 

We've been under weak governance for too long, so I apologise for that. If we thought to ourselves 'fuck this bullshit', and declared war on NK, kicked them out the nice middle class house we've given them here for a embassy is even weakness and a waste of money. 

They do have the largest standing army in the world... I can guarantee you, if we declared war on NK and started bombing them thinking 'its all or nothing', knowing the USA, Europe, and possibly Russia would have our backs should they bomb our populous, Canadian volunteers would be very frequent. You are an English speaking nation with the same world view as us. 

Apply for a visa mate, you probably will fail getting it whereas the nations aforementioned wont, due to weak governance and the way that politicians only care about their own careers, not the fact that they stand in parliament for every man and woman who voted for them - something I hope UKip will not forget.

next time I think I was on a hillsborough thread and brought up how its bullshit that we have to engage in forced mourning every year, it gets massively hyped up and there's not allowed to be any kind of dissent, and I added something about how it's a disgrace how liverpool fans treat Heysel as 'just a wall collapsing', and more of a disgrace how they tried to blame Chelsea fans for Heysel. apparently you can't say anything against Liverpool.

true,Quis_Custodiet,null,null,"Absolutely, bleeding and being unable to stop it yourself is a prefect example of a good time to call an ambulance.  Head wounds  especially bleed a lot, and blood loss of a significant volume is a trauma  emergency. 

It's a mixture of things.  Pre hospital care varies  massively by location, so in large cities that's certainly pay of the issue.  If in most of Europe ambulances are staffed by doctors and specialist nurses then it's a natural assumption that ambulances  elsewhere follow a similar pattern.  The UK has a fairly unique system though. We're most similar to the US, though UK paramedics are autonomous practitioners governed by guidelines rather than protocols.  It would be improper to talk of us being like doctors or like nurses, because we're not quite like either. Probably the best comparison is that we're most like specialist nurses concerned  specifically with acute or acute on chronic medical need or trauma, ALS provision, and some  diagnostic capacity.

There's also an aspect of not knowing what's A&amp;E worthy, though dictating what that means is tricky without making people not call when they should.  I think it's fair to say that if someone's: struggling to breathe, has chest pain, has changed  behaviour, ability to move or speech, is having a mental health crisis, is in a lot of pain, is a child you're worried about, is unconscious, is an older person you're worried about or who has fallen or who has uncontrolled bleeding then it's a good time to call an ambulance.  Realistically, if you're a reasonable person who would not normally call an ambulance and is wondering if you should then it's probably time to. 

I'm not a huge fan of any campaign which highlights anything other than other care options, but that's very much a personal point of view, and I should say everything else is too, and not representative of any opinion but my own.

EDIT: Here's the maths. I'm re-writing odds of '5 to 2' now as '5:2' as opposed to '5/2' above, to avoid confusion with dividing. I'm writing 'x divided by y' now as 'x/y'. Hope that makes sense.

So:

Yes vote of 5:2 = 2/(5+2) ≈ 28.6% 

No vote of 1:4 = 4/(1+4) = 80% 

But we can't have the implied % of yes + no to equal &gt; 100%! It equals approx 28.6% + 80% = 108.6% here.

Therefore, I need to 'scale down' these implied probabilities by dividing them both by 1.086 to get them to sum to 100%:

So yes vote now ≈ 28.6% / 1.086 ≈ 26.3%
No vote now ≈ 80% / 1.086 ≈ 73.7%.

These now sum to 100% and are in the same proportion of the the original implied % chances of the events happening from Paddy's odds. Simples!

The argument they make about false rape accusations is that they are considerably rarer than rapes, and that reddit's paranoia relating to them and redditors' claims that a false accusation is equal to or worse than rape is totally out of touch with the reality. They are broadly correct.

False reports of sexual assault occur at about the same ratio to true reports of sexual assaults as false reports of other crimes to true reports of other crimes. They are rare, and only very rarely proceed to the stage where the accused is even aware of the accusation. They are not analogous to rape but to other forms of making false accusations, and if it progresses further then possibly crimes related to  giving false testimony in court. There is no reason that the average person should be worried that they may be falsely accused of rape any more than they should worry about being stabbed.

That's the sort of crap lazy soap opera writers pull (see the old Dallas TV series).  Yet it is in keeping with his intent to free the Doctor from consequence and make sure nothing bad ever happens to anybody important.

Yes, it is a sore point with me.  Frankly, in my own head canon, I'm ignoring the whole ""forgot"" thing and have the Doctors actually changing their past and finding redemption in doing so.  It is a show about time travel, after all.  Keeps the Doctor interesting to me.

I'm not really sure why they felt the need to bring back Gallifrey.  There was nothing wrong with it being gone, and I know Moffat's opinion prior to the reboot was that Gallifrey diluted or took away from the Doctor's mystique by making him less unique.  

I'm not very optimistic that the writers will be able to incorporate Gallifrey properly.  The most powerful and ancient race in the universe is not something you just throw up on the screen.  It's one thing to have the Doctor's quirkiness and human affectations, but any time Gallifrey was presented in the past, it was always just another planet.  Nothing spectacular about it, which does serve to dilute the mystique of the Doctor and his past.  Gallifrey should be something we can't even wrap our heads around, much like the Time War, and for that reason it should be left to our imaginations.

If they wanted some plot variety, I'd rather have seen them do away with the whole last of the Time Lords thing, and have the odd survivor (or deserter) of the Time War pop up from time to time.  Not necessarily re-hashing Time Lords from stories past, but if the Master survived and two Daleks managed to make it through the time lock, why not any other Time Lords or other factions of Gallifrean society?

AVB's departure, for better or worse, was a call the club made. Tim had to come in and do what he could with a squad without belief - IMO, he's done a great job. 

As to the Sandro thing, Tim may not have been very subtle about it, but he is right. Sandro's a great guy, he gives his all whenever he plays, but he's been poor after his injury.

There are much better explanations I've read, but a faction of Time Lords - specifically those in power were out to commit genocide against all of creation by proceeding with the Ultimate Sanction. Rassilon and his cronies were locked away again after the events of the End of Time, but there's still those people who were in on this plan still alive on Gallifrey now.
In addition to that, Time Lords were looked at as every bit as villainous as the Daleks during the Time War. The weapons used during the war wiped out entire planets and species. Given every incarnations'  loathing for other Time Lords (not all of them, just the society at large), I'm not entirely certain why more thought wasn't given to bringing them back.
However, I do understand the Doctor did require another regeneration cycle. Add to that that the Doctor has always been against genocide (barring the stupidity of using humans to kill the Silence) and that Time Lords weren't the only living people on Gallifrey (most Gallifreyans weren't Time Lords), then yeah, major survivor's guilt, PTSD, etc. TBH, I also liked the narrative that the Doctor always does the right thing, not the easy thing. In that case, getting rid of the Daleks and Time Lords was the right thing to save the rest of the universe at large.

The angst though, of having survived the Time War was interesting, I think.  I miss Nine and Ten. Though I am looking forward to more Time Lord plots involving the Twelfth Doctor.
The saving of Gallifrey does give a but more lee-way for more plots and intrigue. Assuming Twelve finds them where they're locked away still.",0,1397961078,null,0,false,0,cgx08m5,t3_23gwwr,t1_cgx08m5,t3_23gwwr,null,1433434147,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0
true,IHadaFishOnce,RU,russia,"We got this far because of the attitude of our squad. Nothing was given to us and we got where we are now because Mourinho guided us here. We overcame a 3-1 deficirt against PSG and are now in the Champions League semi final. We handed City their first defeat at home. We thrashed Arsenal and Tottenham. We are SECOND in the premier league. This is a squad with an average of ..what? 24? Fresh out of a transition period. It's Mourinho's FIRST season back and we're already, realistically and statistically, en course for a double. We were cheated at Villa, we failed at Palace, we were unlucky against Sunderland and we have 6 more games to play. 

So no, not ""Spot On"" from Jamie. Say what you will about the quality of the squad and the overall performances. Say what you will about Mourinho diverting the blame on the refs. But *do not* question the squad's attitude. Yeah Ramires is a fucking scumbag, but bashing Rui Faria? That's heart. Azpilicueta reckless in his challenge? Fuck no, any other ref would've caught that slip. Mourinho inept? Absolutely not. 

I've watched this video 8 times, each time trying to reason with what Jaime is saying, and each time I just can't help but laugh. We were never favorites for the title, and we were never physically and mentally ready to compete for the title, but we did anyway. Once we have a true striker putting away the 90 chances our midfield creates each game, Redknapp will change his tune. And y'know what? I think that's wrong. 

There's professional analysis that's against Mourinho's tactics. And then there's this. This is just plain old Liverpool bias, pretty much shaming a Champions League squad for not being physically or mentally prepared to compete anywhere because of an arrogant hitler spawn.

That being said, Ramires could have also been sent off for his attack.

And their penalty for me wasn't a penalty, maybe I'm wrong, but it was pretty plain to see that Altidore stepped on Azpi's leg, Azpi didn't take Altidore out regardless, he took himself out. I can see why it was given, but for me it wasn't a penalty, oh well.

I'm still very critical of our tactics though, through the whole season we've lost what should have been easy games, and I still blame it on not having Mata to an extent, we don't have a playmaker that can break down tough defences, and for the last two seasons Mata has given that to us in every single game he's played, he was sensational at connecting our team together.

It's one thing having players running back to defend, but if we can't attack, what's the point?

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"I don't have an issue with what Sherwood said (incidentally i think Sandro's response of ""lol,lol,lol"" was unnecessary and done poorly)...as you said, he was correct the players have to prove their worth.

My issue is how he said it and how he handled the issue.  If when asked about the tweet he had just said something along the lines of:

*""I haven't seen the tweet so i can't comment. I am here to talk about the match.""* 

Its simple, it keeps the focus on the win and buys time.

Saying something like this would have made the whole situation a moot point, it would have given Sherwood a chance to see what the hell people were talking about, it would have allowed media relations to get a handle on the situation, it would have given him a chance to speak with Sandro directly....after doing all that he could have them commented.

Instead (as usual) Sherwood spoke without thinking and as a result is now being quoted by every media outlet around as saying ""Sandro isn't good enough to play for me"", the media isn't going to look into the full story, why bother they have been given a more interesting story by doing nothing.....it became a headline and not a footnote.

Sherwood made the story because he couldn't be assed to stop and think for a second. Sherwood put himself in a position where he is going to be quoted as saying Sandro isn't good enough and risk alienating Sandro and other players.

Notice how the players handle the questions thrown at them by the media?...they give dull text book answers that don't create stories. When the players deal with the media better than the manager there is an issue.

He consistently makes regrettable comments in the media, he consistently makes self serving comments in the media, he consistently makes negative comments about the squad in the media.....Sherwood may not be an idiot...but he is flippant and short-sighted which can be just as damaging.",0,1397962754,null,0,false,0,cgx0wp4,t3_23hb5r,t1_cgx0wp4,t3_23hb5r,null,1433434462,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

true,badcall,num3,,"I think Sherwood plays (or at least lines his team up in) a 4-4-2 simply for tactical reasons. It's clear it was a good decision against Fulham. If I were to guess, the reasoning would be to have (ideally) two strikers to put pressure on the stacked back line that will undoubtedly have lots of support directly in front of it. Maybe he puts Eriksen on the left knowing he'll just drift into the middle and play there anyways, but can still create chances with crosses (which, in case you weren't watching, he's done just that, along with create goals from that same side).

And no, he shouldn't necessarily know at this point who his best starting 11 are. Would you say Lamela's in the starting 11? If we bought him for £3m instead of £30m would you say yes? Based on the fact that we have so many options and only one competition, maybe he's just feeling the pressure of sitting valuable players like Sigurdsson and Townsend.

Really though, you're reading too deeply into his comments and falling into the trap that you've created for yourself that OP described. What you think Sherwood is saying is, ""I don't know my players."" What he's actually saying is, ""We have three starters at the moment and everyone else is just super talented.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Absolutely. I would 100% love it. People who think that this disgusting football that we have been playing is proper counter attack are in for a **huge surprise** if we ever switch to that style. In my honest opinion true counter attacking football, much like Madrid, can be as exciting or even more then tiki-taka style football. Just like its counter-part though it is 100% down to execution. Either style can go ugly if you can't execute it properly.

The reason I have been a huge advocate for us to play a pass oriented game in the past is because I believe you have to formulate your style to your best players. Our best players for the last two seasons have been our attacking midfield players. Hazard, Mata, Oscar and so on. They are not counter attacking players, maybe except Oscar. Hazard can do it but he isn't in the Ronaldo/Bale mold, he is much more in the Ribery mold. He is supremely talented and is a genius with the ball at his feet, he doesn't rely on superhuman athleticism to take him past players (Ahem, Bale's goal vs Barca...), he uses his magic in tight situations, many times from a standing start with his brilliant little bursts of acceleration. For these reasons I think he would be better suited to passing, but not by a *huge* amount but a meaningful amount. But since we sold Mata, a player who would be the center piece of any tiki-taka type football I think our squad can go either way really. It just depends who we sell and who we bring in over the summer. And I would be happy regardless of what path we take because with the right players it can turn into some of the best football. A classic counter from our goal box to the opposition half can be just as amazing as a 20-30 pass buildup that ends with a Barca-esque goal.",0,1397964706,null,0,false,0,cgx1orj,t3_23hgrd,t1_cgx1orj,t1_cgx1flx,null,1433434831,5,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,5

true,TaylorHammond9,null,null,"I really, really disagree with you. If your one concern is that he doesn't have the single killer, perfect pass for counter attacks, that really isn't much to complain about. In realism, we only get a few chances where we need an absolute killer pass out of the midfield. Often we make good out of them, only we have fairly poor strikers at the moment.

If you really want Oscar to get good at 'killer passes', it comes from work in a training, (and ready for this?) and game time. You can't get better with things with out trying them. Don't (and I realize this isn't you) get down on the kid for trying things. Sometimes you just need to, to get better at them. This is what REALLY bugs me about OP's comment of ""IMO he is often the worst of Chelsea's attacking midfield trio."" Seems completely unwarranted, and just some guy talking out of his ass. Don't get me wrong, Oscar has his ups and lows, but so does every player on the team. Don't you guys remember Hazard at the beginning of the season? He was piss poor for a long while. He then picked up form, and now we're all sucking his dick (with reason, he's been on top for awhile now).

&gt;We get through occasionally on the counter like you'd expect, but against the smaller teams that sit back and are happy to defend we look embarrassing, all we do is pass aimlessly to one another around the box or wait for the one and only brana to deliver those disastrous crosses

I'm not sure what this has to do with Oscar per se. This is a team problem. It's tough to break down a counter attacking oriented team (hence why we typically do better when we can get an equal/better opposition) and it just will come with experience and coaching. It's always tough to play against a team that puts 9 guys behind the ball and defends their heart out. It just is. No matter your philosophy of football, it's tough to get chances other than crosses.

&gt;Sorry for the rant but Chelsea need a number 10 that can slice defences with passes not one that gets praised for his defensive capabilities, work rate etc

I agree, other than we don't ***need*** that sort of player. Our midfield does work. Whether you want to agree with that or not, they do very well. Sure it would be nice to have a player that can play a killer ball to (hopefully Lukaku next year) Eto'o for the time being, but it isn't as important as your saying. We still get opportunities. I'm not trying to sound like an ass, but if you haven't noticed, we are (were) in running for the title, and are in the CL Semi-final. That's a good season to me, and that's with out your almighty number 10. I feel like your hinting at wanting Mata back.

Oscar has loads of vision (go spend 10 minutes on youtube, you'll retract your words on that). That comment pisses me off. He executes more than his fair share of good balls. I'm not even kidding, go watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCfD-zqi9e8). If you want me to go through and give you timestamps of all of them, I'd be more than happy to. He does very well with the ball on his foot on top of the box. He makes chances. Now after I've written all of this, I disagree with you more. He CAN make killer passes. Sure he's not absolutely mental at them, but to act like he can't do them to save his life is a laughing matter.",0,1397965263,null,0,false,0,cgx1wbb,t3_23h6wb,t1_cgx1wbb,t1_cgwz9xx,null,1433434928,11,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,11

He was given a clear ultimatum of Champions League football, but was given a dysfunctional team at its lowest confidence ebb in years.  He's gotten some good results, but the team has always needed a confidant, wise, and authoritative hand to conjure consistent performances.  AVB couldn't do it, so why was Sherwood going to?

I completely agree on all of Sherwood's failings and his petulant attitude in the media is awful.  I don't exactly have sympathy for him, but I do think he had very little chance of succeeding.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I can understand what you are saying, and I definitely do not disagree that having a clinical striker would help us loads. But at a fundamental level our team has just lacked any real flow, regardless of what style we have tried to play with. I honestly could not tell you how we try to play because I don't think our own team even knows themselves.

Having a way to play is the backbone of any team. No top teams go into a match without their philosophy of playing. Juventus have their 3 in the back, City have their passing game, with Silva genrally at the helm. Bayern and Barca have their methods. Real plays it's 4-3-3 counter. PSG always plays its 4-3-3 with 3 forwards generally at the top. With a solid play style a team knows which players to target and their is no doubt what they will do in a match.

The problem with us is that we always send out our 4-2-3-1 but there is no real purpose. Sometimes we try to counter, sometimes we just camp in the opposition half with Ramires and Ivanovic somehow running most of the play. And the worse part is that we are not getting the results to really even warrant whatever style we play with. Unless a miracle happens with Liverpool fucking up then CL is our only hope for a trophy this season and that is *far* from a sure thing. 

One thing I am certain of though is that Mourinho will be buying players this summer, and hopefully they are top quality. With his purchases of Salah, Schurrle, Willian and Matic I can see him wanting to switch to a 4-3-3. I think all he really has been waiting for is another top top quality center midfielder to accompany Matic, because Mikel obviously won't do it for him and he can't rely on Lampard every single game to play the position.

true,mon-Soona,null,null,"I'm on my phone and on the road so excuse my lack of backing statistics but your saying 'Game time' and training.  Really?! Oscar has played something like the most minutes in a chelsea shirt over the past 2 seasons. If that's not enough 'game time'  then I don't know what is. 
 
I had a quick look at the 5 minute video you posted. That means nothing. I could probably find a 5 minute video on bendtner highlights, but ultimately that is what they are, HIGH-lights they're obviously going to be good and make whoever they're featuring look like a star. 

Now don't get me wrong  I'm not denying that oscar has had moments of brilliance and I'm not calling for his head, I still think he has a role in the team BUT the ability to play that killer pass is always Important. When u have players like salah and shurrle that continually run in behind defences, it's a shame and a waste if your number 10 can't put them through. 

It's a matter of opinion but personally id like I see hazard in the number 10 with salah and shurrle outside him. He's been phenomenal on the left but he proved he could play the number 10 with Lille. His confidence , control on the ball and his passing ability is good enough for him to flourish in that role.

Finally, I agree. It's been a great season. What mourinho and the team has done, essentially without a decent striker as you pointed out is IMO brilliant . But when your number 10 has made 2 assists in the league ( as pointed out in a previous post )  it makes you wonder what more could've been.

true,zingpong,num23,,"A few things:

--I'm sure that Sherwood uses a 4-4-2 for 'tactical reasons,' although I would amend what you said to read 'simple tactical reasons' instead of 'simply for tactical reasons.' While I would agree that scoring goals is good, and we do more of that under Sherwood than under AVB, we are also conceding more goals, regularly -- and part of that is due to injuries in our defensive line and part of it is due to consistent lack of a holding midfielder, or even pair of midfielders, in our setup. We're still playing that ridiculously high line and still not pressing, but now we also don't have holding midfielders to assist with defense and break up play before attacking players get to the defense. We have, if I'm not mistaken, the highest number of goals related directly to defensive errors. Taking some of the pressure off of players who, for the most part, wouldn't make it into the starting XI if players like Vertonghen, Dawson, and Walker weren't injured, could only be a good thing. I'm all for scoring goals, but believe it or not, you can play attacking football in a 4-2-3-1 or 4-1-3-2, etc.

--I'm not falling into a trap or misreading Sherwood's comments. This has little to do with Lamela, although his blanket statement about him not making it onto the pitch for the rest of the season despite the fact that other reports indicate that he is well enough to return to training are a little surprising. It's not about how much we paid for him -- I'd like to see him play because we don't have a ton to play for anymore and he could use a confidence boost going into next season, assuming we hold onto him. Either way, let me be clear -- I've read and listened to what Sherwood has to say, and I find his comments alarming and, at times, inappropriate. It's not just about the message he's relaying, but the way in which he relays it, and he is ridiculously negative about the team. For my tastes, he's crossed the line. He's gone beyond calling players out for things worth calling them out for and is now throwing them under the bus regularly. Perhaps he is overwhelmed by the number of players and can't differentiate, but that doesn't mean he should get a pass -- sure, Eriksen has played well on the left, but he's •still• being played out of position, as are Chadli and Paulinho. At the end of the day, this boils down to an issue of professionalism, and he has shown very little, in my opinion. I'm sure he's in a frustrating situation, with constant talk of his replacement, but he has certainly not handled the situation with much tact.

I'll shut my mouth, but as of right now, that video is speaking for me. That's half a season.

My point on Oscar's playtime wasn't that he isn't getting enough time, it is that that 'killer ball' comes from playing games and actually getting those attempts. I know he's played more than his fair share of games, that wasn't my point.

&gt;It's a matter of opinion but personally id like I see hazard in the number 10 with salah and shurrle outside him. He's been phenomenal on the left but he proved he could play the number 10 with Lille. His confidence , control on the ball and his passing ability is good enough for him to flourish in that role.

It is absolutely a matter of opinion. Especially since we are Mourinho. What we say doesn't matter in the slightest. What you said is interesting. You think Schurrle and Salah should start over Willian/Oscar? Schurrle has his good moments, but he's had far, far more bad games than good. He's very sporadic. I'll take a more consistent Oscar over him all day, even if it means losing some speed. Our middle three attacking midfielders are pretty interchangeable.

&gt;But when your number 10 has made 2 assists in the league ( as pointed out in a previous post ) it makes you wonder what more could've been.

I've always hated using stats in Soccer for points. They never tell the full story.

I have to say, though, i HATE Moffat's writing style as an episode-to-episode story arc; however the man is second to none when writing season arcs..... sweet mother of baby jesus that man can write.

And as for not making the Doctor a woman... why on Earth is that even a point?  There were 10 Doctors before Matt and none of them were women, yet every showrunner before him had the chance to make him a woman.  It's not like there was any particular reason to make him a woman, especially when the backlash would be tremendous.  And it's not even established if the Doctor *can* become a woman (without drinking some magic potion).  After all, we don't even know if the Doctor can become a different race, let alone change an entire chromosome and sexual orientation.

And of course Sherlock has the same amount of female characters as the original.  It also has the same amount of male characters, because that's just who the characters were.

We are a Christian Country if we follow the religion of our supreme ruler however it is clear that Charles is not following in his mothers footsteps, he wants to be progressive and be the defender of faith, rather than the defender of the faith.

Not a primary source but an analysis of other sources and it should be noted that the author is critical of the wording used in some of the polls they've analysed.

&gt;Some of the questions are not well phrased. It would be interesting to know what the responses would have been had pollsters  asked whether conversion was forbidden, without adding ‘and punishable with death’, or whether homosexuality was wrong, without adding ‘and should be illegal’. (p15)

I had a look for the bit you refer to but couldn't find it, at least not with the 1/3 number you present: 

&gt;Two final figures are even more worrying.  A full 62 per cent of sharia-minded Muslims argued that there is no truth at all in the statement 'How much truth is there in the idea that Islam treats women as second class citizens'. And an even larger number (71 per cent) agreed that wives should always obey their husbands. (p18)

The overall percentage of Sharia-minded Muslims is taken from the responses to the question:

&gt;Some Islamic scholars have claimed for a major reinterpretation of sharia law to reflect modern ideas about human rights, equality for women and tolerance of religious conversion.  Other islamic scholars disagree with this view and say that sharia law is absolute and should not be interpreted to fit in with Western Values.  Which of these is closest to your opinion? (p15)

The options were Pro-reform, Against and Did Not Know.  Overall, 49% favoured reform, 39% were against it and 16% did not know.

So the actual figure is about 27%.  I'd agree that's unacceptably high, but inflating the numbers is unnecessary.

true,_lolwhat_,IM,isle of man,"When given the opportunity, Chelsea will press high and counter and look beautiful. The problem with this is that not everyone is willing to oblige to this and pack in the defence. Hence why Chelsea plays more in possession against lower end clubs.

The fullbacks are fine. You can certainly do worse than Ivanovic. He has a purpose on the pitch and that is to bully the opposing wingers. 

Chelsea could probably use another central midfielder. But again, Chelsea can compete against the best clubs in the world. They certainly have enough quality to beat the likes of Sunderland.

Obviously, Chelsea has a weak group of strikers. But again, still enough quality to beat a low end club.

What Chelsea lacks is the one guy to orchestrate the attack. Oscar has not been the player I had expected over the summer. 

Forcing Mata out wide and then selling him when he was struggling was a mistake. There has been too many times this season Chelsea has needed his quality centrally.

true,DaveTheAlchemist,null,null,"Personally, I am a huge Oscar fan, but I agree that his previous form during this campaign shouldn't save him from criticism now when we need him most.  Now, I am not sure how serious his injuries have been this season, and maybe with all the change over he hasn't have the cohesion with enough players to be able to provide that killer pass yet.

I always thought Oscar and Torres had a weird connection.  It was similar to how I felt Hazard and Eto'o had earlier in the season as well.  

I don't want to get into formation tactics here (but I believe a 4-3-3 with oscar at one of the back 3 wings who can move to the 10 position as well as move to a deep lying playmaker in front or next to a Matic is the way of the future), but the players need to have a better understanding of each other or if they can't get on that special level of subconscious understanding, then they need to at least know each other's roles.

I think the best move Chelsea did was not schedule anything serious after the world cup so everyone can heal up.  During that time, I except a full Mourinho breakdown of the first strategic set-ups for the first month or two of the season, and if Oscar is still playing poorly then, there will be a nervous energy around someone who is supposed to grow and mature with Hazard.

I don't like him, didn't like him when he arrived, don't like him now. He is very good defensively, must be said, and his off the ball movement isn't that bad. But man, a ""10"" player who is creative as a wall isn't helping. I know he is young, has potential, all that stuff. What makes people sure that he will reach that potential? So many players failed and never reached their potential or developed differently than planned. I want to look at Oscar now, how is he now, not some future stuff. 

His passing in the final third sucks, just like Willian's (Willian is worse from what I saw). He likes to shoot and try screamers because he has no idea what else to do, Juventus goal isn't happening again. Watching the team pass around the box without any idea what to do just gives you perfect example how this Chelsea side isn't creative at all, apart from Hazard. 

Someone on this sub posted stats about chances created a few days ago, Hazard is at 100, Oscar second place with 55.

true,_lolwhat_,IM,isle of man,"Vision ties in with 3 things. Obviously seeing the field, decision making, and the ability to execute.

Field Vision: This is one of my criticism with Oscar. He puts his head down once he has already decided what he is going to do. At times, this can be brilliant, but, for the most part, its shit.

Decision Making: Obviously, this ties in above. Too many times I have seen Oscar decide what he wants to do early and completely ignore the rest of the field. For a ""#10"", this is not a good quality to have. This is actually shown in your video a few times. 

The Ability: Oscar can shoot from anywhere. But for, me, the problem are his passes. It is just not good enough. Everyone can make a brilliant pass here and there. But he doesn't seem to have the quality to do it consistently over 90 minutes. 

I tend to lean towards ""vision"" being a gift, rather than something acquired through training. Sure, one can always improve. But, for the most part, being to put all together is something one is wired with. I just do not believe Oscar is built that way. 

I've said on an earlier thread this week, but, I believe his best role would be the 3rd midfielder (Lampard role). His long shots are brilliant and he has the instincts when to make his runs.

Liberal/libertarian politics shouldn't be seen as properly right wing. When dealing with freedom, they mean exactly like what most people imagine to be freedom.  Bachmann being anti-abortion, for example, is not liberal in any way.  A liberal would support things like the right to choice, gay marriage etc.  They wouldn't support things like the PM's tweet this morning (""Easter is a time for our whole country to reflect on what Christianity brings to Britain"").

The difference from the ""progressive left"" is that then, libertarian economic policy would be more similar to the Tories - i.e. try and develop free markets and not burden them with excessive regulation.

In theory, I think the Lib Dem's should fall roughly in that category - generally pro-market, but pro-civil rights.  I say should, because these days they are entirely spineless and can actually fit in any pigeon hole.

This also drags down the performance of nearby secular schools because they have no choice but to try to educate all the rejected delinquents etc. It also kicks off a feedback cycle: well off middle class parents who are involved with thier childrens education (and whose kids will usually do better than average academically) use their resources, contacts and knowledge to get thier kids into the better performing school.

Here fucking here. I'll post this here, just as I did in the cunting off Ramires thread....

I'm hearing all these fucking comments such as ""Bad day to be a Blue, that's for sure"". Well you know what? You take the rough with the fucking smooth, that's what supporting your team is about, not just the fucking glory days - the wins, the trophies.

They're our players, our staff, if you didn't feel the frustration building to the point of eruption like Faria did yesterday, then I'd seriously question the passion you feel, I was watching with my family, my Nan - 93 years old, (her mother was a lifelong Chelsea fan too, she comes from the World's End), my Dad, my Brother, my Mum, all felt that frustration and passion, tempers were flying, colourful language used, it happens, Faria just personified everything we were feeling, and a damn good other amount of Chelsea fans too!

It doesn't have to be this one particularly but this style of card is excellent.  FairFX is well regarded and I have used them a lot without issues.  No transaction fees and good exchange rates.  You still pay to withdraw cash so I'd say take another card for cash withdrawals, some UK bank accounts offer 0% withdrawal fees but usually at poor exchange rates.  I think something like the CaxtonFX EuroTraveller may be best for you.^[\[2\]](http://www.caxtonfx.com/currency-cards/currency-cards-for-you/#5-reasons-to-get-a-card).  ""Caxton FX does not charge a fee for international point of sale or international ATM transactions. However, some merchants or ATMs may do."" Usually very slightly worse rates than FairFX, I have not used them but they seem good.  The difference in exchange rate is often *tiny* (50p/£1,000.)

You can move cash over to your Euro card by using your normal UK debit cards (or whatever else the provider you use supports), it's an excellent solution.

Hope this helps!

But overall and in any country, verbal promises are something different than written promises and very hard to have upheld because they are hard to prove. That's why someone could give a verbal promise to get a result in the short term even if they don't intend to keep it.

I guess they might have lied, sorry. 

That said, you should communicate with them in writing, and you can build credibility for your argument by putting bits and pieces of this in the communication. Like if you say that ""as you may recall when we moved in we were told X, and this hasn't happened"" - if they **don't** say that ""we have never promised X"", but basically some kind other kind of response which indirectly acknowledges, accepts or simply doesn't challenge the assertion, then that's a little bit of evidence. 

It sounds however that the landlord and agency together or individually aren't going to cooperate. What you have to fall back on is what is required by the law, because even if you can't have promises enforced for lack of evidence, you can have legal standards enforced. I'm really just speculating here but unfortunately I think that they would be able to fill any legal standards by sealing the windows rather than replacing them.

This can perhaps be seen as a life lesson - promises from unknowns are often a good idea to get in writing, or at least to confirm in writing (""Hi, just confirming our earlier conversation that ____"")",0,1397987535,null,0,false,0,cgx7hz8,t3_23i02x,t1_cgx7hz8,t3_23i02x,null,1433437634,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

&gt;At least six Birmingham schools at the centre of an *alleged* Islamic takeover plot are set to be placed in “special measures” by Ofsted in a move that could see their entire leadership removed.
The six schools are *implicated* in the so-called “Trojan Horse” plot by extremists to “Islamise” secular state education in Birmingham which has *allegedly* seen the illegal segregation of pupils and discrimination against non-Muslim pupils.
The Telegraph understands the six will be rated “inadequate” by the schools inspectorate after a series of snap inspections over the past few weeks. The label usually leads to “special measures”, which in turn give Ofsted the power to remove senior managers or even close the schools.

(My emphasis added). So the story is that these schools are going to be drubbed by Ofsted for failings  that may or may not have anything to do with an islamistist plot that may or may not exist.

If it does it exist, then the plot should be stomped on hard, currently it seems *likely* to me that something of the sort did occur! but I want to see the details, and I don't think Gillighan's conflating several things  is helpful or accurate.

But Oscar is not our Zola yet, and may not ever be, so I encourage those to give him due patience and let him develop into the legend we all know he can be. 

There is a lot of nerves on the sub due to the title race, which our manager doesn't even think we can win. Many are saying this is a tactic, but if you look at our results against many teams we should have full points against, we have come up short. There is a reason he is saying we are not title contenders yet. It is difficult to wait, but I believe that patience will reward us greatly in the near future.

Short version is that there are three benefits available. There's a pension for the widow/widower if one is present. There is also a pension available for a nominated partner if you are unmarried. The partner has to be someone you could legally marry and are financially interdependent with- you can't sneakily leave it to your best friend.

Second is a pension payable to your children under age 23. If you have no children, or they are over 23, then it is not payable. The pension can be extended under certain circumstances (for example if your children have health issues).

Third is a lump sum. This is payable however you want to whoever you want. You can split it up and leave it to family, friends, charitable concerns, trust funds, pretty much anything.

To nominate people to get the lump sum you need to file a DB2 form with the NHS Pensions Agency. If you do not then your lump sum is added to your estate and divided accordingly.

To nominate a partner, you need to file a PN1 form. 

The payout varies depending on circumstances, the table linked to above will tell you more. ",0,1397990489,null,0,false,0,cgx7wpw,t3_2369c3,t1_cgx7wpw,t1_cgx7ofm,null,1433437826,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3

Reddit is like a bubble - a generally left wing (with streak of libertarian), super tolerant bubble populated by 16-35 year olds.

We also have younger people who don't read internet forums like this and get their views from their parents and the TV. Bear in mind that our best-selling newspaper is the Daily Mail.

true,unexpecteditem,null,null,"&gt; NOP Research: 68% of British Muslims support the arrest and prosecution of anyone who insults Islam;

I hope by now I have acquired a well-earned reputation as a hard-line freedom-loving secularist and liberal, however, the way you have presented this statistic is I think unduly alarmist. I find it hard to believe that even now 68% of British muslims are avid supporters of tracking down and arresting anyone who in some sense insults Islam. Here's why. 

Firstly, it goes back to 2006 in the wake of the Mohammed Cartoon issue. Attitudes may in any case have mellowed in the near decade that has passed. I have experience of newly-arrive bigots  mellowing in as many years after living in and coming to appreciate this country and its freedoms. Indeed it's hard not to mellow when living a good life here.

Secondly, you have to bear in mind that most of these people are from one country: Pakistan. In Pakistan it is already against the law to insult Islam. Why? Because during British India, to keep the peace between the main religious groups (Hindu, Muslim and Sikh) the authorities made it an offence to insult another's faith, and in the newly formed Pakistan created for muslims after partition in 1947, it soon morphed into this more authoritarian requirement never to insult Islam in particular. Now it's just a fact that when you grow up in a country you tend to take its well-established laws and practices to be more or less normal, necessary and good. That's just what it is to belong to a culture. When you move abroad, you cannot help but continue to feel the same way initially. So they have moved from a culture of equal constraint not to offend another's religion to one of equal freedom to do just that. From the point of view of many Pakistanis, they don't insult Hindus or Sikhs, so why can't others have respect for their religion? I'm not saying I agree with the implication of this, but I think you have to put it in context. This is just what they're used to.

Thirdly, I have the impression the rate of Pakistani immigration was considerably higher back in 2006 under Labour. This is important because there would have been a higher proportion of new arrivals back then. 

Fourthly, the war on terror was in full swing with Iraq still very much in people's minds.

By the way, if you doubt that bigots may mellow, let me tell you a story. I knew one new arrival full of this ""don't offend our religion"" business who avowed never to become a British citizen because he would never become a citizen of a country for which he was not prepared to fight and he could never fight for the British in Iraq or wherever. I hated him. Some years later I am forced to meet him again. He is now married with a good job and, by the way, proud of his new status as British citizen. What am I going to do about that? Well, I remind of what he said and he had completely forgotten, though couldn't deny it. Furthermore he started praising British people for being not racist. I was frankly touched by the transformation of the former insufferable bigot under the influence of our comfortable and liberal society.

In conclusion, when you put it all together I find it hard to believe that even now 68% of British muslims are avid supporters of tracking down and arresting anyone who in some sense insults Islam.

Privatisation is one of those things that sounds good in theory but if the privatised thing has no competition it fails.  If we look at how that plays out for the NHS for instance you are not going to have competing hospitals offering the same service but trying to beat one another on price. How it plays out instead is services within the NHS will all be sub contracted out to the lowest bidders. There will be a constant drive to reduce over heads which will mean reduced service.

true,backtowriting,null,null,"&gt;I don't think we should be worried about Islam. We should be worried about extremism.

I was looking at [this Quran verse yesterday](http://www.noblequran.com/translation/surah2.html).  

&gt;And if you (Arab pagans, Jews, and Christians) are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down (i.e. the Qur'an) to Our slave (Muhammad Peace be upon him ), then produce a Surah (chapter) of the like thereof and call your witnesses (supporters and helpers) besides Allah, if you are truthful.
&gt;But if you do it not, and you can never do it, then fear the Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.

Do verses like that not make you think that there might actually be a problem with Islam?  

Take a look at the Quran.  Read just about any chapter and it seems to be the same thing over and over and over.  It starts off by saying that God is great and powerful and so on..  And then you start getting little sermons about how the unbelievers are going to be punished in hell for an eternity because only Islam is the truth.  

I've only read it at random, but as far as I can see, the Quran is *not* a pleasant book full of inspiring tales and good deeds.  Rather it's a call for everyone to submit to the absolute, unchanging and singular truth, because those who don't will be tortured for eternity.

I really wish it weren't so!  I really wish I could say that Islam is a mostly humanistic religion which teaches respect, peace and tolerance.  But I don't think it's like that at all.

Edit:  People are quite rightly replying with equally bad Biblical verses.  I'm an atheist of the Dawkins school, but I think that the New Testament arguably carries a relatively more humanist message than the Quran.  But even if you don't agree, it seems to me that most modern Christians have learned to filter out the bad verses and cherry pick only the nice bits.  And even then they regard those bits as more metaphor than the literal truth.  In short, modern Christians have learnt to stop believing in large parts of Christian theology.  What worries me is that there are too many Muslims who actually believe this stuff.

Edit II:  Being accused of cherry picking - but I found the above verse after seeing the surah being endorsed on /r/Islam yesterday.  I've also look through random chapters in the Quran specifically to avoid cherry picking.  If you doubt me, then try it for yourself.  Go to an online Quran and read through it at random.  I'll be interested to hear what you find.


OK, I opened [another Surah at complete random](http://www.noblequran.com/translation/index.html) and within a few lines we see - 

17. Verily, the Day of Decision is a fixed time,
18. The Day when the Trumpet will be blown, and you shall come forth in crowds (groups);
19. And the heaven shall be opened, and it will become as gates,
20. And the mountains shall be moved away from their places and they will be as if they were a mirage.
21. Truly, Hell is a place of ambush,
22. A dwelling place for the Taghun (those who transgress the boundry limits set by Allah like polytheists, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah, hyprocrites, sinners, criminals, etc.),
23. They will abide therein for ages,
24. Nothing cool shall they taste therein, nor any drink.
25. Except boiling water, and dirty wound discharges.
26. An exact recompense (according to their evil crimes).
27. For verily, they used not to look for a reckoning.


[And another:](http://www.noblequran.com/translation/index.html)

&gt;8. And many a town (population) revolted against the Command of its Lord and His Messengers, and We called it to a severe account (i.e. torment in this worldly life), and shall punish it with a horrible torment (in Hell, in the Hereafter).

9. So it tasted the evil result of its disbelief, and the consequence of its disbelief was loss (destruction in this life and an eternal punishment in the Hereafter).

10.  Allah has prepared for them a severe torment. So fear Allah and keep your duty to Him, O men of understanding who have believed! - Allah has indeed sent down to you a Reminder (this Qur'an).

Try it for yourself!  It's page after page after page of discussion about how those who disobey Allah will suffer torture and eternal punishment.  

Edit again:  [This Quran site seems to be the most easy to read](http://www.noblequran.com/translation/index.html).  Visit it, and pick a Surah at random from the LHS bar and start reading.  Don't trust me!  Maybe I'm lying and I am secretly cherry picking like my detractors are saying, so why not read for yourself?

Regard:

&gt;If a man or woman living among you in one of the towns the Lord gives you is found doing evil in the eyes of the Lord your God in violation of his covenant, and contrary to my command has worshiped other gods, bowing down to them or to the sun or the moon or the stars in the sky, and this has been brought to your attention, then you must investigate it thoroughly. If it is true and it has been proved that this detestable thing has been done in Israel, take the man or woman who has done this evil deed to your city gate and stone that person to death. On the testimony of two or three witnesses a person is to be put to death, but no one is to be put to death on the testimony of only one witness. The hands of the witnesses must be the first in putting that person to death, and then the hands of all the people. You must purge the evil from among you.

Which is Deuteronomy 17:2-7. Obviously, on the strength of this verse we can conclude the entire religion of christianity is of a rampaging religion of militant martyrs.

true,mrcaio,BR,brazil,"I'm on my phone so sorry for any mistake. What I have to say is: I agree that Oscar is playing poorly sometimes, mainly in the last matches, ok. But IMO this is not all his fault. look at our team. We don't have a good striker, and when Hazard is in the bench there is a huge chance that we would not be able to even penetrate the penalty box.

What Oscar and Chelsea needs is a team who is constantly moving around, every player trying to confuse his marker. If you watch a game of Brazil, Oscar is always doing good. The team creates opportunities of pass, through fast movimentation and clever rotations. Neymar is fast, hulk is a fucking monster,  strong and good at sprints, and even or striker (Fred) moves wisely in the box,  always trying to be unmarked.

You can't be creative if your team is static like a rock and easily marked. Just pay attention to this: When Hazard is on fire, playing with confidence at one side,   Oscar finds more opportunities and plays a lot better than what he played on these last performances. Our whole team plays better, because we finally have someone who can create chaos in the opponents half.

That is also why we miss Drogba so much, he was always dangerous in these situations. He could pass through one or two defenders using only his body. We don't have this type of player anymore.

These are the matches, I think, that cost us the season, and in each and every one of them we had the chances. Even with 15 shots, a team aiming for the title should score more than 1. Now, people say that a lot of our chances come from the midfielders taking long/optimistic shots, but for me that's just a symptom of the big, obvious problem - we need a looming striker.

When you have someone like Drogba, Ibrahimovic, Costa or Lewandobski up front, defenders have to pay attention to them. Eto'o and Torres help a lot during the build up, but by doing so they drift backwards/towards the wings and essentially become another midfielders. When you have a specified target man, even by not touching the ball they affect the opposing defense and alter its form.

Quite a few times this season you saw many of our players (Ivanovic, Oscar, Ramires to name a few) take hopeful shots from 20+ meters, ending in nothing. Hell, Oscar had a similar situation during a counter in yesterday's match. The problem is that these shots are taken because we have no one in the box, ready to get that final pass - it is an act of desperation.",0,1397995732,null,0,1398001267,0,cgx8pz8,t3_23i75x,t1_cgx8pz8,t3_23i75x,null,1433438209,75,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,75

R/soccer is a bloodbath, if your comment isn't in anyway positive for Liverpool you are buried.

I have felt like there should be a bit of a squad clear out over the summer for a while and this maybe compounded that, I love Ramires sometimes but I question if he is really what we need for the future.

Read both sides. Read the Guardian and read the Daily Mail.

To be politically educated you have to understand what the people are reading (and believing) to fully understand why people think a certain way and why they go for a particular political party.

The biggest failure of left wing politics is [confirmation bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) by trying to block out the right wing press. 

I've seen this many times. Most of my friends lean towards the left; there's an election and the right wing (leaning) party gets in to power. No-one can believe it because they don't know anyone who would vote that way, so therefore they think the majority of people must be that way inclined as well. It's a bit of a shock to the system when it happens.

I'm pretty sure the right wing press read the left wing press in order to find weaknesses and to formulate counter attacks!

Politics being politics (i.e. conflict) everyone disagrees about questions like that. 

Politics is in pretty much everything, as more or less everything we do relates back to how we want to live and what sort of society we want to be in. 

By all means if you want to understand the ins and outs of the election process itself, an afternoon with a basic textbook or wikipedia will sort you out. However nobody is going to give you a definitive answer to what the wider implications of various outcomes would be: the parties themselves probably even don't know that.

As others have said though, read omnivorously. In a formal sense there's philosophy, economics, sociology, journalism... or informally there's novels, TV, films, music, art.

You can learn a lot about the current political situation from watching, say, benefits street and reading the various political party and press reactions to it (and meta-reactions to those reactions).",0,1397998320,null,0,false,0,cgx982p,t3_23i81g,t1_cgx982p,t3_23i81g,null,1433438447,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Hey guys,

Thanks for bringing this up xxxxx. I'm removing this post.

I like to be pretty liberal with regards to what's allowed here but I loathe this word and don't think it's acceptable to use. Like you I refuse to be associated with it.

We don't have any subreddit rules (due to its size) and this hasn't come up before. Previously we've tried to allow the community to police itself, and generally it's been successful, so perhaps you can forgive it taking a few hours and bull0x wanting some more input before making a decision. In the future we'll be able to remove it as soon as a mod notices. I'm reluctant to add a rules section but it's something I'm happy to discuss / open to changing my mind about.

true,Morethanlikely,1986,Hasselbaink/Ramires,"I still firmly believe that Willian is detrimental to Ramires' contribution. He gets forced to the centre of the pitch, which is definitively not where he is  at his best. He belongs towards the right (or in some rare cases, the left) of the pitch when it comes to the offensive third. Willian feels more like a player that is out in to put less workload on Ramires but in the end it takes away his biggest strength - his versatility. He is basically a 40% of Ramires concentraded into one player. He doesn't do anything particularly flashy to make up for it either. 

It doesn't help that Oscar's been awful past weeks/Months. The only players Ramires can link up to now are Schurrle, Salah and Hazard. And most of the time only one of them will play, and two of them are more likely on the left side of the pitch and Ramires tends to be the one who passes towards the right while Matic prefers towards the left. But since Ramires gets shoved through the middle and isn't the world's best short passer (as we all know, his biggest weakness by far), he tends to shoot when he gets into that position.

The way Ramires should be utilised more is along the right side. He should be allowed to make the runs Ivanovic does, without Willian being there to disturb his play. Ramires' short passes suck, but his crosses are excellent.

I believe that if Schurrle takes over the spot along the right side (but more central, similar to the times when Mata was put along the right wing), Ramires will again get to shine. I think Mourinho really needs to use his versatility better, because the the players that roam along the right wing (ivanovic) can use that to reinforce our defense better.

The backhand towards Seb Larsson was idiotic though, but at the same time I truly do believe that we got royalled fucked by the refs on several occasions, not just the Larsson push on Ramires (and the attack he did against his heel just before the backhand, which seemed to be the retaliation there) or the ""penalty"".",0,1397999240,null,0,false,0,cgx9fpa,t3_23i75x,t1_cgx9fpa,t3_23i75x,null,1433438546,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

true,Sparklesnap,flair4,,"And yet he's scored more than any of our other Central Midfielders this year. 

Paulinho is not a ball-mover like Modric, or a slashing dribbler like Dembele. People keep expecting him to be these things that he simply isn't. He's a decent passer who can help cycle possession, does a good job tackling and winning the ball back, and has a great sense about where to be when he makes late runs into the box - which is why he's our joint 4th best scorer in the league with 5 goals.

So yes, Paulinho is a very decent player who can sit deep and help break up play in midfield, cycle the ball, and then ghost into the box and score or set up a goal.

Paulinho has 5 goals and 2 assists in his 27 league appearances. 
Dembele has 0 goals and 0 assists in his 28 league appearances.
Nabil has an assist, Capoue and Sandro each have a goal.
Nabil has appeared 14 times, Sandro 15, Etienne 12.

No other midfield player has been as instrumental in creating goals for us as Paulinho.

He's also throwing in at least 2 tackles and an interception a game, as well as averaging 44 passes a game with an 85% completion rate, both of which are 6th best on our team.

true,ZFree2013,null,null,"I think the defenders we possess are mostly Ok, its just a lot of silly things. Also as shown today, players like Sakho are not inherently bad players, however they look comparatively worse in a system that relies upon being masterful with your feet, when you have to not only defend the ball, but then pick out a pass that you know you have the ability to make, it must be difficult, especially if you know you cant ping balls around like Gerrard or Pirlo.

And today as another example, when we lose the ball in midfield, the players are not terrible at following the correct runners, however often commit a lot of fouls or mistakes when possession is won back, leading to situations where goals are likely. 

Another area we seem to be weak in is fall backs. Flannagan is good, but still inexperienced in some areas, and Johnson is often guilty of doing things in the heat of the moment, he seems to have one game where he gets everything correct, but then another game he is either caught out of position or not really stopping the runners. 

I want a fall back that can defend as well as distribute but also keep a good idea of where they are are on the pitch. One thing I did notice, was they seem rather powerless against good dribblers like Silva, but better when met with pace alone. 

I think Johnson is a good player though, so not singling him out as a bad player, I just think defensively we seem to have a problem switching off or making mistakes, which at the top level of football you can rarely afford to do, Like skrtel whilst a massive tank in defence can be prone to being a bit dirty, which on a good day everyone can nod and say well done, on a bad day, a penalty is given. Sakho has also had two lucky escapes in the last two games, this week was more of a slip, however against city I think it was, he lunged in at one of the players needlessly.

I would stick with the players I think, maybe an addition to shake things up. I cant fault the goal keeper too much though, as whilst he is prone to making a few silly mistakes, his reactions are brilliant and he looks a very solid keeper. 

But then, I am no manager, so take the above view with a large dollop of salt, The only experience I have is arm chair manger experience.

In fact I almost certainly did more than you to show respect to the 96 given that I was at a football match and participated in the commemoration. You? You probably weren't at the match, and in all likelihood, you don't even live in the UK. 

I love how smug and entitled you can be, bandying your fanship around as if it endows you with some moral high ground. You literally weren't alive when Hillsborough happened. 

&gt; No Liverpool fan thinks Heysel was caused by a wall collapsing

You've got another thing coming, friend. Liverpool fans love to deflect, deflect, deflect. At the time of the disaster Chelsea fans were widely blamed. Let me repeat CHELSEA FANS were blamed for a disaster in a Liverpool away match. You don't remember this, because you literally hadn't been born yet. The amount of Liverpool fans that I have heard downplaying the disaster saying ""oh it's the fault of the stadium's weaknesses"" when the whole cohort of liverpool fans charged the Juve fans, tore down a barrier to get at them. It's fucking shameful. 

Hillsborough is the perfect disaster for Liverpool fans because they can blame the police, the establishment, the Sun for the disaster and 'coverup', and then they can yell other fans for not respecting their disaster more! It's vintage victim mentality. ""My disaster was worse than yours, hence I deserve special treatment"" is a classic psychological tool in order to inflate one's self-importance. Yes, it was tragic. But so was Heysel, Valley Parade, the Ibrox disasters, and so forth. Yet we don't hear Juve, Bradford, or Rangers fans banging on about these things year after year after year. 

In the end, older Liverpool fans can relate to it and expect us to as well because it's something that *could have happened to them*. Yet in modern grounds, it can't. Likely as a result of the disaster in fairness. That's partially why we hear so much about it. It's these high profile incidents that stick in the mind. But it's not going to happen again in the UK. So being forced into mourning for something that other fans that have grown up in an age of no standing terraces cannot relate to year after year after year is tiresome. That in addition to the endless banging on about Liverpool's history makes others perceive Liverpool fans as insufferable and self-absorbed with an inflated sense of self-importance, merely for being a fan of the club. So that's why I'm sick of hearing about it. I'm not ignorant. I hold a dissenting opinion of an incredibly touchy subject. Yes, I am perhaps callous. 

Oh, and in reference to your lower post: people call liverpool fans murderers not because of Hillsborough (although these days you're not allowed to mention that part of the reason for the crush was ticketless liverpool fans routinely forcing their way in without tickets) but because of Heysel. They literally murdered three dozen Juve fans and injured 600. Call Chelsea fans thugs, nazis, etc, but if you are going to OWN the legacy of Hillsborough, then OWN Heysel as well. Don't just pretend one didn't happen. And if you follow the sane route which is to say that it was a violent minority of fans then you can *never criticise the actions of a different set of fans (Chelsea, eg) for the actions of a minority*. You can't have your cake and eat it too, mate. ",0,1398000953,null,0,false,0,cgx9uaf,t3_23gg9d,t1_cgx9uaf,t1_cgwzis4,null,1433438738,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

He has no first touch. He can't pass. He can't shoot. He loses his head easily.

He is an absolutely abysmal footballer. If I wanted a marathon runner as a footballer, I'd give Emmanuel Mutai a call. Ramires needs to leave this club as soon as possible. There are benefits with him - mainly running really fast - but that's not good enough.

We are going to lose a lot of players from centre midfield this summer. We need at least two or three in. It's as big a problem area as up front for me.

I'm not saying Hendo isn't a good player and doesn't deserve his starting spot. I am saying that you should probably chalk Lucas' performance to a bit of match rust.

Is this taught in schools? Barely!)

Why even have religious schools? I can't fathom a logical reason as to why?! Because a child might be exposed to other elements? That can happen anywhere. Because it might offend a parent that their precious was educated about certain sex practices? Be glad that they are taught to be safe instead of them learning about it elsewhere or having fear indoctrinated into them and screwing them up for life.
To keep your children with likewise minded? Bullshit, the CoE around the corner from me lets all religious backgrounds in despite the focus on CoE; and does that stop them from being idiots and doing drugs, or titting about? Not at all, if anything more people I know from that school have had teen pregnancies and serious drug abuse than my low run school that I attended.

&gt; Ever had the feeling you were being ripped off,

So much for the big society and compassionate Britain. The story reacts in horror as one woman is said to have claimed 9 food parcels in 4 months. Or 27 days of food in 120 days. It also cries abuse when the person turns up at a CAB, lies about being in dire need and receives a voucher. It also says how the charity doesn't normally turn away people despite not having a voucher. How dare a Christian charity give food to those who say they are in need! As our dear lord said `feed the hungry, but only 9 times per annum and only upon receipt of a p45 and 12 months of bank statements showing genuine hardship. Even then thou hungry shalt of really pulled themselves up by thou bootstraps'. I also didn't know that there was such a profitable black market in Tesco Value bran flakes.

That said when I saw Cech was out sick, I knew right away that was going to be a problem against a team fighting for relegation. I do believe that had Cech been in goal, that first goal would never have happened and it would have been a different game. Our strikers looked up for it. Torres had purpose. Demba tried. Eto'o kept trying. It was unlucky. But I think once the crowd and everyone else with two functioning eyes saw that We weren't getting any favorable calls and Sunderland were getting away with murder, tension and anxiety started from the crowd and into the pitch. As the game grew, so did the tension and Sunderland knew they could get away with everything. And that also changed the game. 

All of that said, we have difficulty breaking down these teams. We lack some creativity and vision. Oscar kept shooting right at Mannone when he was taking shots but was otherwise useless. I always regretted selling Mata and making him our 10. I think we can agree that experiment has failed. Ramires can't pass and as he's a huge liability Id be happy to see him sold. We need a proper left back so we can put Azpi on his preferred side and Brana can miss a few games and research how to cross a ball. And of course we need a striker. That goes without saying

true,high-ho,lfc99,,"It's a fair complaint but it ignores some key things. First, it's impossible to play the kind of high energy game (which we all love to watch) for more than 20 minutes at a time. This is why the boys come roaring out of the gate every game: we can punish complacency and use all our energy to make an early impact, then operate on the counter attack. Second, every game has a rhythm and at some point the opposition WILL be dominant. It's nigh-on impossible to dominate a game for 90 minutes straight. Third, Rodgers knows that his team has stamina where most opposition teams do not. Give them the ball; let them have it; they'll make mistakes and then we pounce, having reserved our energy for the right moment rather than expending it throughout. Fourth, there's the ""phases of play"" approach. Defense and midfield circulate the ball and wait for an opportunity to turn in midfield and attack. If that opportunity doesn't present itself, the ball gets circulated back. This takes less energy to do and keeps the ball with us. (This is also why I get annoyed when Suarez miscontrols passes from midfield, because it breaks the whole system and we have to work to get the ball back. But I forgive him....because he's Suarez!)

It can be AGONIZING to watch, I agree. But it isn't bad management, and nor is it bad play. Rodgers has always said that he wants every player to be confident on the ball and to *want to have the ball*, and he will never criticize someone who has the confidence to receive the ball and be patient with it. This is why Johnson and Sakho -- both of whom looked vulnerable today -- are solid players for Rodgers. 

It's clearly not without danger but I believe that, in Rodgers' mind, the danger is less pronounced than tiring players....especially with a long season already behind them and key games to come. 

The real advantage of this approach will be felt in Europe, too. It's very clever...though terrifying to watch at times.

He obtained evidence that a CAB worker will fill you out a voucher for the foodbank if you turn up and say you have no food. You have to give them lots of details as the article itself says. 

Is it mismanagement to operate this process, or is it mismanagement to spend huge amounts of money fully vetting and means testing every applicant to tackle fraudulent claims that we have no evidence exist in the first place?

All it proves is you can defraud charities - not that people actually make a habit of doing so.

Also important to note: the charity itself makes no judgements at all on peoples eligibility, but relies on external agencies for referrals to them - most of which will know more about their clients than the CAB does. 

You know what's so fucking toxic about this? You see people fly off the handle in the jobcentre when given referrals in front of everyone. It's humiliating - and you rarely find people in a foodbank who are happy to be there (why the hell would you be).

But I do agree with you on some of these points - the fact we simply cannot sustain the intensity and energy we put into the first quarter of nearly every game. Also, yes opposition teams will have periods of dominance during the 90.

My main issue is the fact that when we do tire out, it looks as though we willingly invite pressure on ourselves. This is not a smart idea when we've quite clearly run ourselves ragged AND the opposing team want an instant reply due to early leads. The opposition knows that if they press high and in numbers against 4 or 5 players, we're going to lose the ball more than keeping it. That prolonged pressure then builds into momentum and so, chances are created and goals are converted.

It's plain in our body language that the leads we initially make are actually hanging by a thread as soon as they create something positive. That my friend is more of a pronunciation to opposing teams than anything.

In Europe, I fear this will be very exposed if we don't sort something out. Our explosive starts may not have the same effect vs. possession hogging teams like Bayern and our liabilities at the back will be found guilty against teams who pressure with conviction a la Dortmund/ Athletico Madrid.

He's an amazing shot stopper but he makes some dreadful decisions about when to come off his line, I think it really could be over confidence or panic.

Against villa the ball was heading towards a clear Glen Johnson in no danger when he rushed out and punched the ball over his head and villa were able to score. He did the same thing today, we had 3 defenders in front of him and they were covering it, no real danger when he comes flying out off his line and knocks it into Skrtel and they score because he's so far off his line, now every keeper makes mistakes but these should be pretty easy mistakes to correct - hold your line unless there is certain danger and trust your defenders. I think everybody will agree that his distribution is also cringey at times but I cant complain when were top of the table but I think a lot of this has to do with our strikers, when we do concede it tends to be a lot.

I've tried talking about this before but everyone jumps in to defend him with 'every keeper makes mistakes' and 'blame the defence' - I'm not against him at all, but I honestly think we probably could find a better all round keeper for the moment though cant complain, we should be looking for the best best upcomer though

If you find Century Of The Self worthwhile, then there's a book called 'Manufacturing Consent' that goes a bit deeper, but since it has a very American point of view, and primarily references news stories from the 1970s and early 80s, it may not engage you as much.

true,OptioMkIX,null,null,"&gt;But that is not what people who are proud to be English are doing. The fact of the matter is, as is seen in increasing rates especially in Greater London, the influence of the muslim population is taking over. The English people are becoming wary/afraid/angry of the muslim population, perhaps due to the work of a few (i.e. the two recent beheadings which were both done by muslim men for religious reasons), yet the fact remains that it is this population that they are afraid of, not the atheists or the Christians or the Sikhs. 

In some boroughs, sure. But you'll still find the greatest majority of people are white or white british and the influence they have on the law is miniscule unless you're talking about small local bylaws for things like opening times or exemptions in noise levels for the call to prayer but most are still very law abiding.

Everyone knows Lee Rigby, so who was the second beheading?

&gt;The government beginning to bend over backwards, allowing ""shariah courts"" and ""shariah wills"" which are completely illegal when compared to the normal Law. These people are creating the turmoil, that's why there is uproar, albeit in too small of a quantity.

No, they really are not. Allowing ""shariah"" things in this way is pretty much exactly like allowing binding personal agreements between citizens without the state interfering. If the agreements or practices conflict with the law of the land then they are brought to justice and charged like anybody else. If these people want to obey these courts then its no different in the eyes of the law than obeying the decision of the board of a private members club. 

Same thing with wills. While it is against the general UK ethic of equality, there is nothing in familial wills that says that somebody's estate MUST be divided equally. The estate of the deceased is broken up as according to their will and barring unusual circumstances the state does not intervene with the deceased individuals wishes. So while its not great from an equality point of view, largely people are shit out of luck for having been born into that culture. 

See this release:

http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/analysis/comment-and-opinion/sharia-wills-the-facts/5040744.article

Regardless, the overall thrust of this is is that just because a thing does not conflict with the law of the land does not mean the same as creating a separate, internal law.

Anyone should be free to offend anyone's religion so long as they cause no actual physical harm. We should not tolerate any attempt to impose religious practices or prohibitions on others except in cases of actual physical harm. We should continue not to tolerate violence or speech advocating violence. 

In short we should strictly apply liberal principles of freedom of speech, tolerance for all, equality before the law, and the separation of church and state.

Should be enough right here. Now, would you be so kind as to link me the sources where non-muslims stoned rape victims to death? Or would you be so kind as to link to me the source showing a non-muslim politician promoting the death of non-muslims? Or, would you be so kind as to link to me an article showing non-muslims beheading people because of their religious beliefs? I'm sure there will loads for you to reveal unto me.

Quran (2:191-193) - ""And slay them wherever ye find them, and drive them out of the places whence they drove you out, for persecution [of Muslims] is worse than slaughter [of non-believers]...and fight them until persecution is no more, and religion is for Allah."" 

Quran (9:5) - ""So when the sacred months have passed away, then slay the idolaters wherever you find them, and take them captives and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush""

What a lovely religion.

Now, as there is no rebuttal to this, you will undoubtedly say something about how other religions are harmful. I agree that facets of Christianity are bad, such as its homophobic verses, yet isn't it funny how a large portion of Christians, as seen in England and the USA, actually are not homophobic, they prefer to live according to the Bible's nicer verses. Funny how no muslim seems to operate in this way.

That said,

- There's nothing to worry about on the subject front - your combination of subjects is (as far as I know) the most common one for maths students.
- Try to get as good marks as possible this year - when deciding who to offer interviews to, AS results are one of the few things they have to go off of.
- There are quite a few good books on the reading list (linked to from the admissions page). In particular, I'd recommend ""A Concise Introduction to Pure Mathematics"", or one of the other textbooks. You don't need to go over them in too much detail, but it is assumed that you've read up on logic (of the kind covered in that book) before arriving in first year.
- Most important of all: Do lots of preparation for STEP! I had an arrangement where I answered three questions a week all through upper sixth (going up to six a week later in the year) and had my maths teacher check them. That's the absolute minimum you should be doing, and in hindsight I wish I'd done more.

Dave, who is consistently praised here often to the point that he is impossible to criticise completed none of his. Again goes to show how the narratives around this place consistently completely ignore fact or reason.
