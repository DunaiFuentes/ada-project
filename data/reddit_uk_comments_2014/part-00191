Things like CND and Neil Kinnock's Labour party or even shopping at the Co-op seemed like giving in to the evil red empire and only Ronald Reagan and his space lasers and Margaret Thatcher's Falklands winning resolve would protect us from the four minute warning of impending incineration.

They were weird, mad times, and everyone's politics were a bit mental, and I think most people that lived through that era has had some sort of reevaluation since.

Now, I believe in a mixed economy where infrastructure, utilities and welfare is socialist, based on reciprocal altruism and a belief everyone should be looked after, but everything else is fair game if you want to make a profit at it. 

Which means I'll probably vote Green, but might give Labour a shot.

First of all, I'm so *so* glad to have found this place! There's a whole host of smaller UK subreddits that I had no idea existed but felt like there was a massive need for. Which is why I started /r/skincareaddictionuk because there were times when I felt a little frustrated posting in r/skincareaddiction and I'd get recommendations to products that I couldn't get or I could only get online. 

As helpful as the sub has been for me, I felt like we UK skincare lovers could do with a little space of our own where we could discuss products we have easy access to. Hopefully this new sub will be useful to some of you in addition to the main skincare subreddit. My aim isn't to take over it, it's a lovely community! Just to supplement it a little.

Hope to see you guys over there!

true,NesquikMike,null,null,"Hi, I'd just like to thank you for actually engaging me in a debate instead of just downvoting me and slagging me off. I'd also like to apologise in advance for pissing you off as I can be quite hard headed. I'm going to make my points with regards to cannabis as I want to put my points out there for others to hopefully read. I will then elaborate my thoughts on our modern western disposition. 

In Britain weed has essentially been decriminalised. It's real easy to get, this cannot be denied, you really don't have to look hard, especially in a big city, to find some. If Police catch you with it they give you a cannabis warning, no criminal record. That's not a deterrent. Since the Misuse of Drugs Act from 1971, which brought about these incredibly liberal legal changes, cannabis use in this country has sky rocketed. 

There's a big argument in the pro-drug lobby that restricting supply, as we are doing, barely effects total weed sales and makes it more lucrative for drug dealers. This encourages crime in two ways; it creates competition among rival gangs, and the high prices encourage poor people to commit crime to be able to afford the drug. I'm in complete agreement with this argument.

Legalising and heavily taxing weed would not solve these problems. Poor people will still not be able to afford expensive weed. Drug dealers will be able to undercut the high prices and still make a big profit as they're not being taxed. Especially, if you can legally grow your own. The gang problem then would not be solved. Also, middle class people  might be able to afford buying their favourite breed of Purple Kush from their legal supplier. But, working class people, who legalisation would really hit, would be forced, out of poverty, to look for cheaper deals from their dealers.

Enforcing harsh laws on both dealers and users would solve these problems by reducing demand and supply. Drug dealers would not be interested in it if it's not a lucrative business thus alleviating the gang problems. 

This is before we even factor in the health problems. Weed can be mentally addictive, in some, admittedly rare, cases it can cause psychosis and schizophrenia, and depending on your chosen method of consumption - smoking - can cause cancers of various kinds. For some people there is no way to know what effect marijuana use will have on them, we should not encourage people to be taking these risks with their mental health. Especially when mental health issues do not merely affect those suffering with them, but, also, their loved ones and places strain on the NHS. 

The present zeitgeist is a perverse liberal postmodernism. What I mean  by this is that postmodernism with its emphasis on socially constructed realities and subverting authority has led us to the idea that we should live for ourselves and has made us doubt that restricted pleasures, whether legal or societal, actually effect other people. 

When combined with the doctrine of western liberalism, that as long as an action does not harm anyone else it should not be illegal, this is very dangerous. ""All of the barriers to *my* pleasure are just socially constructed and merely maintain white male privilege, they should be subverted."" You can see this strand of thinking in the argument that marijuana being illegal is just a way to marginalise black people. Other examples of the zeitgeist is the increasing easiness with which people can get divorced ""i.e. fuck the kids, your tits have gotten saggy"", binge drinking rowdiness, sexual objectification of both sexes. 

Let's again ask the question what effects will legalising weed have. It will allow people to buy weed easily encouraging more people to take it, give them greater choice in their choice of strains, and remove the stigmas and barriers to smoking in public. Rehabilitation can be offered without legalisation, and legalisation does not have any impact on re-offending. Except of course for re-offending for taking weed which would be legal, but that's not cutting crime that's just making more things legal. 

Getting high is a completely self-contained activity. It's not a panacea that makes everything better, it just gets *you* high. There is just no need to legalise weed, and I think think the issues associated with it can be better tackled by enforcing harsher drug laws.

&gt;You were the one originally annoyed at people articulating absolute moral opinions and forcing them on other people

True

&gt;except that's exactly what your doing? 

**Half True** to a far, far, far, lesser extent and without the ""shaming""....and also in defence of a person. I am against gang bullying someone, for something they done that shouldn't affect anyone.

* Gang bullying, ""shaming"" does affect people.

* A person sucking 24 cocks does not affect people. Just like Gay Sex, or a person smoking weed.

I wouldn't even call it a ""moral"" as such. More empathy and tolerance.  Do no harm to others, live and let live.


&gt;Your issue is your getting worked about 

Not really ""worked up"". But I do strongly appose forcing people to live by their morality or else.... they are publicly shamed or even arrested....**When** what they do doesn't affect anyone. I feel the same way about people getting kidnapped, locked up in a cage and their future job prospects ruined by the government for smoking weed. 


&gt;So feel free to judge the moral policemen

I will call them out. They are trying to rule others by their morality when it's none of their business as there are no victims...except for the ones that they create because of their morality being forced on people.

&gt;don't go on a moral high horse yourself and argue those people are petty for judging.

Can't do that... I will go on a moral high horse.

Victimless ""moral crime"" **V** shaming a person and their family publicly for that ""moral crime"" 

I argue against the attack on this girl and her family. People can judge all they want."" *I will suck 24 dicks if I want. None of your business.* ""

  


The two sides are not equal. The girl did nothing to affect anyone. They(media etc..) are shaming the girl, interviewing the family and hence shaming the family, posting disguising character slurs of the girl, informing Spanish officials for comment etc...  

  

 

&gt;It seems to be a case of the pot calling the kettle black. 

Yes..hypocritical (the judging people for judging part).  But that's not all, they Judged, jury'd and socially executed her. I am merely calling them out for that. They didn't just judge...and their judgement is based on something that doesn't affect them. The threat of being socially shamed could affect us all.

 
 

There was a time that both of us would be shamed for having this conversation online.

        Ring of seedy people on the internet

        chatting in a chatroom ring about sex

        sharing disgusting sex videos

        using disturbing language

        We contacted their family to see what they thought about their sons dirty pastime

        We contacted police to see what they thought

I hate to tell you this, but 200k isn't that much money at all, especially in funds, shares or pensions - and whoever told you, you need a fund manager is lying. Fund managers are more explicitly for funds, not pensions (granted SIPs can be in funds); fund managers are also not for investors. A fund is basically a bundle of shares, people (lots of people) pay into the fund and get money from the bundle, the guy who picks the bundle is the fund manager; if you decide the bundle yourself you're an investor, if you join the fund you're still an investor, if someone picks the bundle for you and don't form their own fund, they're a profile manager.

Usually a [wealth manager](https://www.findawealthmanager.com) would require a minimum of around 150k in your account, a [profile manager](http://www.hl.co.uk/advice/professional-portfolio-management) would be about the same. They really offer very little other than not allowing you to make any active choices. Sounds more like you want an accountant to me, banks usually recommend this around the 50k mark; some would pay their own.

true,Andyl66,null,null,"I have certainly become more socialist, although I would like a system that had a full and real free market economy.  It isn't fair that the big corporations pay zero import duty and almost zero tax.  It should be the opposite, if you start a new business you should pay zero duty up until you show a certain level of profit.  

I live in Thailand and this country has a real free market economy and in just the last ten years the Thais have grown in personal wealth by some magnitude.  It too has a very good Universal Health Care system that is growing and improving day by day.  The gvt do also supply things like housing and money to those who need it, but Thailand is simply not wealthy enough to have a full on Welfare system.  However, this is indeed its aim.  There are little market stalls, street sellers, tiny street food stalls etc absolutely everywhere.  They all make enough money to live, and from what I can see they seem to be doing pretty damned well out of it.  Every Thai I know has a house in the country, an almost brand new 4x4, enough gold to sink a battleship etc.  

Thailand has taught me to never judge a book by its cover.  I've seen who I thought were dirt poor farmers get married and throw down around 20 acres of land, 5 ounces of gold (10 baht) and 60,000 UK pounds (3 million baht) as a dowry payment to their brides family.  Who in the UK can do this?  The lowest sum I've heard of has been 500,000 baht dowry (roughly 10k UK) and that was from a 17 year old kid.  How many 17 year olds in the UK have ten grand to give away?

Real free market economies work.  If the UK allowed a Thai style trade there would be zero unemployed tomorrow.  Corporations have paid off the gvt in the UK to ban unlicensed street trading not to protect you, but to protect them.  If you want a snack at lunchtime you have to visit a shop that is hammered by rent, slaughtered by local taxation, so you are paying at least £2 for a sandwich that is worth 20p to make yourself.  If all those unemployed could have street stalls you'd be paying less than a pound for the same sandwich.  You have millions who are purposefully kept unemployed because it keeps wages low, they in turn feel helpless and the net result is higher crime.  Thai crime figures are low, despite it being a supposedly poor country.  From what I can see, yes Thailand is poorer than the UK,but the average Thai has more money because of it's infinitely fairer distribution of wealth.

Oh and I've lived in Thailand for four years and I eat street food every day and not once have I had food poisoning.  I have had a dodgy tummy from eating way too many spicy foods though :). If you come to Thailand there is only one golden rule to avoid food poisoning - do not eat the shellfish - Thais have enzymes that we don't have, the shellfish are fine for Thais to eat, but westerners can end up hospitalized.

true,notsoyoungpadawan,null,null,"&gt;1) What does being Brazilian have anything to do with this? We are talking about individuals here.... Since you don't like Brazilians i'll switch up and name 10 more for your ass (none are Brazilian). Mikel, Riquelme, Bojan, Freddy Adu, Alvaro Recoba, J. Dos Santos, Nani, G. Dos Santos, Pennant, and Andres D'Alessandro.

Mikel won the Champions League at 25. Riquelme scored 17 goals for Villarreal at the age of 27, was awarded most artistic player by Marca at 27. Neither Bojan nor Freddy Adu ever made it in the big leagues, nor were they as important to their teams at 25 as Costa, so again, poor examples; its like mentioning Michael Woods, who was touted as the next Frank Lampard at one point in his youth career or Jacob Mellis who was supposed to be the next Jermaine Jenas. Dos Santos doesn't count since he's 25 right now but let me say that he's the most important player for his National team and for his club which finished 6th in the league, so again, poor example. Pennant? Wot? Nani won 4 league titles with Man UTD was included in the PFA Team of the Year in 2010/11, was voted Man UTD Players' Player of the Year the same year. So again, poor example. Andres D'Alessandro was fucking overrated. Goes to show how much you know about football.

&gt;2) Everyone knows the only reason why Ronaldinho ""sucked"" was because the fame got to his head. There was a documentary about the fame getting to his head. He felt bigger than the game itself which caused all of this. That's different than you just sucking. Still at the end of they day, you can't say he ""sucked"" because he revolutionized the game and brought a whole new style to it. Winning various amounts of trophies/awards in the process. Bringing a lot of fans/income for the teams he played for. There wouldn't be as many Barca fans as we have today if it wasn't for him.

Yeah.. Except I never said that he ""sucked"".

You mention Adriano but I don't think you know that he ended up ""sucking"" after the death of his father and wanted to move back home. Or maybe you did know that and you mentioned him anyway.

&gt;Everyone expected to get better but look what happened. He didn't, the fact that he showed promise at a young age didn't mean that he would get better. So your ENTIRE argument is completely invalid now. You're just gunna pull something out your ass to make up for your idiot ass statements

LOL wtf are you on about? Costa has already won the Spanish league, played in the CL Final and was 3rd highest scorer in the Spanish League. Did any of the players you mention achieve that at 25? No.

&gt;4) Mutu was doping himself. So i'm PRETTY sure you can't say he was ""amazing"" if he was cheating. Mr. I follow football.

Errr... He wasn't doping, he was doing cocaine. That's not the same as doping. Stop embarrassing yourself. 

&gt;Implies that you think he will ONLY get better because he is relatively young. AKA guaranteed improvement.

No it doesn't. Its what you have interpreted it as having to be; i.e. you are deluding yourself.

&gt;6) I've debunked everything you said. Gave you MORE players that have flopped at a young age. You have no argument here. I'm not going to respond to what your going to say next, because it's probably going to be worse than the comment i'm responding to now. Stop playing FIFA, you probably suck anyways. You don't get better with age always.

Actually you haven't debunked anything. Gave me more pointless examples. Flopped at a young age? Why is that relevant in a discussion relating to Costa who is 25? Fucking mad.

&gt;You don't get better with age always.

The difficulties are in what you do on busy buses. If you get on the front, you can pay quickly, but it's really tricky manoeuvring down the isle past people and dodging the poles. If you get on the back, you can quickly get the buggy into the disabled area, get them settled but then you have the issue of having to fight your way to the front to pay or the horrible scenario of having to get off the bus to get back on the front and pay, then off again to get back on at the back.

People, I find, can be great or shit. Many people give up seats so my eldest can sit down and not have to stand on the board the whole way, but an equal number of people seem oblivious and will happily take up the seats nearest even if they're not elderly, disabled or with kids themselves.

Overall it's not too bad but if you're going to be using buses during rush hours it's a lot harder.

Edit: by the way disabled people have priority in the buggy/disabled area so be prepared to have to fold your buggy if someone needs that space. Although it's extremely rare this happens.

A copy of the since-deleted exchange on Ummah.com:
http://www.freezepage.com/1404621393WQOVZCNVJO

The last time something like this happened, it was the work of a man named Glen Jenvey, who was posing as a journalist with one profile and posing as a muslim-turned-extremist with another, the latter so this 'amateur terror expert' could then 'expose' the examples of extremism that he himself had created in a story that he would sell to a tabloid newspaper:
http://www.bloggerheads.com/archives/2009/01/glen_jenvey_has/ 

I exposed the plot with the above article, but the Sun newspaper defended their terror 'expert' rather than admit fault, and even accused me of calling Jenvey a paedophile:
http://www.bloggerheads.com/archives/2009/11/graham_dudman/

Jenvey went onto defend himself against all reason, and ultimately went on a smearing spree; posing as a Daily mail journalist, he went on over 100 websites posting comments that accused me of being a paedophile, and a convicted child rapist wanted in several countries:
http://www.bloggerheads.com/archives/2009/03/how_nice/

Jenvey had his reasons to be upset with me, but he was convinced of this 'paedophile rapist' lie by a former partner of his - Dominic Wightman - who by coincidence also had a personal political beef with me:
http://www.bloggerheads.com/archives/2009/09/the_glen_jenvey/
http://www.bloggerheads.com/archives/2012/04/douglas-morpeth/

24 hours after the 'Morpeth' article was brought to the attention of senior parties in the local Tory group Wightman was associated with, someone using what appeared to be Jenvey's IP address in Wikipedia sought to again smear me a paedophile, some 3 years after the original event. But in this instance, the writing carried all the hallmarks of someone else's work, and that someone had been using an IP-masker to hide their identity.

With all of this in mind, it is logical to acknowledge the possibility that someone associated with this previous scandal: (a) may be posing as a Daily Mail journalist in order to stir shit and get them into trouble, or (b) may be posing as Jenvey posing as a Daily Mail journalist to stir shit and get Jenvey into trouble.

**TL:DR - I call shenanigans. Complicated, deeply personal shenanigans.**

true,Jlowry13,null,null,"&gt;Flags, arches, murals, everywhere. It's such an eyesore. Now, I know that you think these kinds of displays are great, but I don't, definitely not to this extent. It's so over the top. It makes me feel to some extent a hostage in my own home, but country-wide.

Some do look tacky, and others defiantly need a lick of paint. But how does an expression of cultural identity that make you feel like a hostage? You're not being forced to do anything, you're not being stopped from having your own display. It's not a widespread campaign of claiming parts of the country, all of these arches are put up by local people, acting within the law wanting to express themselves peacefully.

&gt;We all have to share the place. I think our landscape is one of our best features, I think it's a real shame that both sides have taken to these excessive displays of tribalism. Yeah, I get it, you've both got a terrible history together and don't have much respect for each other, so you identify with your families and neighbours and church friends who were all raised in the same culture. 

I agree and outside of Belfast it's shared very well, whereas inside of Belfast there are issues, and there are very few arches about.

&gt;So the culture is real and it's OK to identify with it, but as usual, the third culture; i.e everyone who is indigenous but doesn't identify with the nationalist or unionist sides, immigrants who come from other cultures etc - is ignored and constantly subjected to a landscape, culture and reality of openly sectarian paramilitary flags/murals/marches/riots on a fairly cyclical basis. That's not on, and that's why I got annoyed at your arch. Because it just sums all that up. 

Paramilitary flags and murals are nothing to do with the Orange order. There were over six hundred parades on the 12th last year, only one had any bother at it, and that to the rest of the parades we have it's easy to see it's not just the parade that's causing these issues.
Our public demonstrations do not prevent anyone from having an identity of their own or a means or expressing that. People are free to identify as they wish, While the politicisation of some parts of our shared culture has made it difficult for some to engage in it, it an be hard to determine a way to get away from that, but there are a growing number of parades they do not come from a PUL background and at the very least there is still that option for them. 

&gt;I know that's not how *you* intend it (or is it, even a little bit?)

Not even a little bit, I live in a mixed area, o have friends from various different backgrounds and cultures why would I want to offend my friends and ruin the peaceful community I live in?

&gt;but some do intend their displays to be aggressive, intimidatory and crass - it's those communities' responsibilities to rein that in, no?

Some probably do, and such actions are in contradiction to the institution's beliefs and ideals. A lot of the jeering and singing comes from 'supporters' who aren't in the institution.


&gt;No, because as we see, politics here is governed by relative extremists, especially on the Unionist side (and in increasing degrees of absurdity, recently,) so no change is coming soon!

Should Unionism not be engaging with wider Unionism and Loyalism to try and get them on board with the political process, did the leaders of unionism this week not get the PUP and UPRG to commit to peaceful means of protest?

&gt;So to me, your expression of culture is kind of a middle-finger, along with all the other middle-fingers given in every flag, mural and march. 

That's not why we do it, take a look at what happened in Rossnowlagh yesterday for example.

&gt;I guess you have the right to offend people, 

What's offensive is subjective.

&gt;but you're all over the bloody country, everywhere you look. As I said, it's such an eyesore. 

Should we all be rounded up into one little corner then? We live all over the country, we work all over the country, we are the largest community group in Northern Ireland of course were going to be all over the country.
 

&gt;Why can't people like yourself have a bit of consideration for other people in the country?

You have no idea the work we do the rest of the year and how we engage with communities, Grand Lodge of Ireland met with parishioners of churches and chapels along the parade route for covenant day to deal with issues, Newry district this week said they want to leave their main demonstration earlier than usual so they can parade Newry earlier when there will be less people about, Newtownhamilton had mass leaflet drops informing people of their parade last year, Keady kept their demonstration out of the village centre, the Apprentice Boys are working tirelessly in the Maiden City. To say why can't we shown some consideration is rude crass and insulting, simply because of all the work we do across the country to show consideration.

Considering that he's been able to shut down Barcelona, Bayern, Real Madrid and Chelsea's own efforts, that's very impressive. Personally, I think he was probably the second best left back in the world last season - behind from Alaba. 

Football stats are good things to use to identify trends, but comparing players with side by side statistics like you're doing is completely bollocks. Wolfsburg and Atletico play differently, don't play in the same league, and week in week out Atletico play much stronger opposition. Left backs attack so irregularly that all your stats tell me is that Wolfsburg use Rodriguez as an attacking channel to flood forward down the left. Apart from that they say nothing, literally nothing. They don't say which player is better in attack, they don't say which player is better in defense, they don't look at positional requirement, they don't say if opposition coaches are choosing to attack down the left/right against the individual defenders, etc etc. They're creating the illusion of understanding, and anyone who'd watch both players play more than a couple of games will tell you that Luis is, in most circumstances, better than Rodriguez. 

TL:DR Felipe Luis is phenomenal, Rodriguez isn't quite there yet and might not get to the same standard. Stats like OPs are bollocks.

I think a lot of people will remember this game, Chelsea were only just becoming a good side, what with Oilbramavich and all. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink was a monster. Liverpool dominate the game but Veron (yeah that asshole) scored mid way through the first half to put Chelsea 1-0 up.

The pressure was mounted on them for the whole game when in the 75th minute (ish), Dioufy was taken out by Wayne ""Leave My Wife Alone"" Bridge. Owen nearly hit the corner flag with the penalty, but Cudicini came off his line so it was retaken, and he buried it.

But of course this was the beginning of the Chelsea we know and hate. Hasselbaink went up the other end, controlled a fantastic pass from Lampard, and scored a beautiful volley into the bottom right corner.

Cunts.

true,free2bejc,1986,Gianfranco Zola,"That's not at all true. In a 1v1 sprint without the ball Ivanovic can keep pace with almost everyone. This is why this criticism of him is getting ridiculous. He's not got the technical ability to go forward at pace with the ball but he's damn quick. Combined with his usually good positioning he will almost never be beaten down his side unless an overlap is involved. Combined with the fact that his crossing is actually underrated and we lack a striker who makes near post runs like Giroud or somebody better.

Why do you think there was a period last season where all he did was tap it round opposing full backs and sprint past them. That's not a random thing, the coaches obviously had confidence he could go round those players. I distinctly remember him taking it past quite a few midfielders on a break against basel too. It's not that he can't do it reasonably regularly but that he's much more defensively disciplined.

I mean Ivanovic had better attacking and defensive stats than Bosingwa who was our last ""attacking"" Rb, although they're not even in the same class really. Dave is a special case really because he's probably the best RB in the country. He's quick for any position. Bran is quick for a defender. He's certainly quick for his size which is a definite plus and gives you all kinds of extra options from set pieces. Dave is better at picking a pass for a cross rather than driving to the byline and turning back. He's also much much more comfortable running with the ball when there are players in front of him. 

Against Ronaldo, you'd probably want Dave, he's quick enough, strong enough, and often reads the play well enough to exploit the space behind whereas Bran will just want to drive into space that's in front of him on a counter. Saying that, both of them clearly have the discipline to know when to offload the ball. The only actually ""slow"" member of our defence is Terry. Bran is more than capable of dealing with pretty much every winger in the PL. I can't think of more than 2 he struggles with. Some wingers can shift it past him but that's just down to acceleration and usually size but that's where his positioning is usually spot on.

that is not what we're led to believe. the doctor is a very anti war kind of person. also it's (to my incomplete records) never stated in the show that 
&gt; it's always war time for the Doctor 

It's fine for you to have this as head cannon, but Hurt was called the war doctor because he fought in a war. in **the** war. the great time war. the last of the great time wars. It was the most catastrophical wars ever and the wardoctor was central to it's execution and its dramatic end. 

That's why he is the wardoctor. what defined him was definitely that he came along during war time. that was what he was. a soldier (he was made to be that way!) 

also I think the doctor is not 
&gt; at war against the hate and evil and negativity [in this universe]

what i like about the doctor is precisely that he is not some kind of God looking after his universe, or a guardian angel, or a knight on a neverending quest to save the universe. He does that because he helps where he can. (side note: this is why it's so important and special that he says ""it is protected"" when he talks about the earth. The earth stands out for him and he looks after it, more so than the rest of the universe.

* ""When I decided to go to Southampton, many were surprised. But I went because people from the club had great ambition. They assured me of their project, the former chairman Nicola Cortese and former coach Mauricio Pochettino enchanted me with their approach. They filled me with incredible confidence. When I started to train, I realized that Southampton has a very good team. They promised to buy two more players, they bought Osvaldo and Wanyamu, they are great players. The goal was to attack European competition, at least in the Europa League.""

The collapse of the system

Southampton left behind a very good season, the club has never had better results in the Premiership. However, this winter begun a variety of speculation, the departure of President Cortesea was announced.

* ""Even then I saw something off in the club, no one knew who would take over the club. Then to me the whole story became suspicious. I asked coach Mauricio what it was, he could not say whether or not he would remain on the bench on the project that was promised it would last five to six years: investment in the club, attacking the Champions League, bringing new players and keeping those major. Because of this, after all, I agreed to sign for Southampton. And then went the president, coach Pochettino practically already left in April, and I realized that it was the breakdown of the system.""

In particular, he was hit by another situation.

* ""Liverpool made an offer, and the club didn't report it to me. Even after that, about the new Liverpool deals. It was not fair. I learned about the offer from other people, it really hit me and I realized that I no longer have anything to do with Southampton. Liverpool has sent an offer of 20 million pounds, and they paid me 9 million pounds, they would have made more than twice. Oh look, I'd love to stay in Southampton if the club had some ambition, if they have preserved the main players. I would not be shaken by an offer from Liverpool.""

What is the situation now?

* ""At this point I do not know what I will do and I do not like that. And indeed it was unbelievable that a few days ago they agreed to an offer of 20 million pounds. It was in the morning and in the afternoon they said that I'm not on sale? Frankly, my head is in Liverpool. Anyway, I sent a letter to the club where I said all this I told you.""

What did they respond?

* ""Nothing to me, just thanked me for the letter. It seems to me they want to keep me on ice, which again is wrong. And honestly I do not know who's the main man at the club right now. They're now looking for 25 million pounds for me, but I don't think they will get it. Liverpool is one of the biggest clubs in the world. Only Real Madrid has so many fans around the globe.

true,sausagedownatrain,eng-devon,Devon,"I think this is the point that most people are confused about IMO.


In an entirely state operated NHS, the system still works as a company. The NHS is given objectives to meet (ie provide A&amp;E, treatement, etc) and it operates from a budget (tax collected and given to the NHS). What this is effectively does is provide a profit motive of meeting objectives in return for the amount of tax they are given, however the amount of money they are given is unlikely to reflect on how well they have done. If anything, failing to meet objectives will be explained by a lack of resources. This creates a system of poor service = a bigger budget hopefully or a services being cut.


Now a government regulated privately provided NHS would still have the same targets. However, companies will bid for providing something such as dealing with cancer. The company that offers it at the lowest price but still meets the government set targets will be awarded that contract. What this establishes is a reward system for being as cost efficient as possible whilst still meeting the targets. If the company does not meet it's objectives, it will lose the contract and other bidders will be given a chance and it is likely the government will consider that the budget for that objective should be raised.



These two system effectively provide the same service. The NHS and private companies would still be attempting to provide the same service but private companies can be chopped and changed when they fail - this is not so easy in the NHS.



The difference is that people feel that the NHS is better at providing a less tangible idea of 'better care' whilst private companies will just do the bare bones of what is required. That depends on your opinion of that really. 



I think if the government manages to regulate the system properly, ie set realistic targets that include patient well-being, provides money per treatment rather than patient (to avoid letting people die as the treatment is too expensive) and writes up some better than usual contracts then it will provide a better service. The issue is that the government has a pretty bad record on most of those things.



The NHS already contracts out services; can't afford certain treatments so won't provide them; focuses on targets/objectives more than patient care and operates GPs as private trusts. This isn't as big a change as the standard dialogue suggests.



You can go deeper into it and say that the better efficiency that capitalism normally comes with will not happen due to the level of regulation required - ie that the targets will need to be too restrictive for the companies to have the options to make it more cost effective.



The crux of the argument IMO is how well you believe the government will regulate the companies. It is effectively how the NHS is run anyway as far as I can tell. The niceties provided are done by the nurses and doctors rather than the management, that will still be the case.

According to [the gov.uk site](https://www.gov.uk/motorcycle-helmet-law) a helmet must EITHER

* meet British Standard BS 6658:1985 and carry the BSI Kitemark
* meet UNECE Regulation 22.05
* meet a European Economic Area member standard offering at least the same safety and protection as BS 6658:1985, and carry a mark equivalent to the BSI Kitemark

Also, reading [this PDF from Think](http://think.direct.gov.uk/assets/pdf/dg_195215.pdf), there's a section which says 
&gt; Helmets sold in the UK must satisfy either British 
&gt; Standard 6658: 1985 or ECE Regulation 22.05 
&gt; standards. Look for a label inside the helmet or 
&gt; on the shell to confirm this.

My understanding from these sources is that the helmet design MUST pass 22.05, but there's no requirement for each helmet produced to display the marking.

There is a requirement for the visor to be marked, and the visor on this M10 is marked ""Exceeds VESC-8"", which is a US standard – which leads me to suspect these are EU-certified helmets produced for the US market and imported.",0,1404642760,null,0,false,0,cipr866,t3_29r56g,t1_cipr866,t1_cip52eh,null,1434576760,1,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,1

I don't think the whole group is evil but anyone who openly identifies as ""my only concern is that things stay the same"" effectively has a mind that is throwing no-ops. I think to openly take this position is to have an empty mind that some third party could fill with whatever they wanted if they can convince you it is somehow traditional. I've seen ""conservatives"" argue that traditional British liberty is a continental concept on here and in the media recently without appropriate laughter resulting.

I trust the state ever less as time goes on. I think any problem* should be approached by first asking where the state might be causing this problem and fixing that. Though I'm no longer opposed to the state actually intervening when the problem in question no longer has obvious causes from government. One caveat to the ""fix the government first"" approach is that it doesn't work when the problem is globalised. I'd love to fix international IP law to get drugs prices down but we shouldn't give in to corporate price gouging until we fix that. I don't believe in having a free market in government backed monopolies.

I've become more trusting of individuals on three fronts. Firstly bad people are a lot rarer than most people (including myself) have assumed. Secondly I've become less nationalised and more globalised, I don't see why the Bulgarian who works with me is any less of a person than a Brit I've never met, this brings my judgement of a person towards who they are rather than which box they came out of. Thirdly the individual is mostly harmless on the grand scheme of things.

Generally I've come to favouring near pure liberty on a social basis and a middle ground of extremes on economic liberty (in that most of what I would do on economics would be seen as being pretty far to the left or right).

Every instance of government socialism in the UK has been better than it's capitalist and privatised counter part. You name it: the trains, British Gas, the NHS, British Airways.

When the NHS privatised the cleaning units by contracting it out to private companies we saw rampant MRSA outbreaks enter hospitals becuase some woman working for the cheapest cleaning firm is hardly going to care if a hospital is clean at £5.50 an hour and no pension.

Now British Gas are part of the big six they pretty much have monopolised the market - with all 6 companies raising gas prices each year. 

Anything that was privatised we saw the costs go up and received a worse experience. I expect time will show the exact same for Royal Mail.

So what would you have done in the Falklands War without an aircraft carrier?

The fact is in the modern day we try and stop wars before the come to us. Iraq may not have had biochemical weaponry, but suppose it did. Suppose Tony Blair was right. We cannot keep relying on America to help us on the military front. An aircraft carrier lets us fight threats across the world. 

&gt;What's happening in Ukraine shouldn't require military intervention from the West. It requires diplomacy

Change a few variables, like the country attacking Ukraine. Suppose it was a lesser country without nuclear weapons. Then the tables have turned. 

Problem is you are taking recent conflicts and justifying why an aircraft carrier is needed, which is fair enough. But these conflicts only need 1 or 2 different variables and suddenly an aircraft carrier is needed. 

The world is a highly volatile place, and I'm not naive enough to believe that rising powers across the world could one day threaten us. An example, if the Taliban keep infiltrating and taking over Pakistan, we could have terrorists with nuclear weapons soon.

This one is a little more complex. If we measure the strength of the country on solely on GDP then high costs for non-working members of society are a bad thing. If we factor in quality of life and general happiness then it's not as big a factor but still a bad thing for large numbers to get more out of the system than they put in. However, if we accept that there is a finite amount of profitable work (work that adds to the GDP and not detracts from it) then the problem is clearly people ""hogging"" the good jobs and not the people on benefits.

&gt; regulations

Again a little more complex that regulations are bad. Some regulations seem over protective i.e. having to pay a qualified electrician to do certain work in your house that you feel you could do for much less. The regulations are not there to protect you, but every other person that might live in or do work in the house in future (by complying to a strict code, certain assumptions can be made that prevent injury or death). The reality is that these safety regulations are **expensive** to society but do save lives.

There are of course regulations that are unwarranted and need to be addressed. A lot of businesses and social projects are stifled by over the top regulation (which is sometimes there because it keeps the competition down) and unfortunately we lack any mechanisms in government for tackling the small details of social policy in any effective way. Except internet porn, somehow that got onto the PM's agenda.

&gt; schools

I disagree that schools are the same as the NHS. We have failed to take advantage of technology in schools in areas that could have made huge savings, which could then have been used to address the serious problem of class room sizes (How is 1 adult realistically supposed to not only control, but educate and support 35 people in an hour?). Largely rote subjects like languages and the humanities should be replaced with quality pre recorded lessons and the teacher replaced with 2 learning assistants who can answer questions and moderate the class. Books should all be digital by now, e-readers are dirt cheap.

We have too many exams and too much emphasis on test scores because politics demands statistics to show the media. We need to break the stigma that only academics is important at school level and promote vocational learning. If the teaching unions were offered better job security I'm sure they'd sit down with the politicians to make schools better.

&gt; most foundations

I hate what charity has become. Charities operate as businesses, not just paying large salaries (even though the staff would earn much more in the private sector), but the general mentality. Charities should be spending every penny now, not investing it because the long term profits will allow them to help more people. Charities are meant to be short-termist! You're not supposed to have large lush HR offices because you employ over 1000 people! You're supposed to be small organisations that do your best even though it's never enough and feel guilty for spending 50p of the charities money on biscuits for the team! I hate ""big charities"" who operate as businesses, I'd rather have 100 small less effective ones because the principle matters as much as the outcome! And government backed foundations are the worst, comfortable jobs for social elites who get to play Samaritan with other peoples money, throwing big parties for their friends because ""it raises more money than it costs"" and hob-nobbing with celebs.

An excellent read, and honestly very important in terms of setting the stage for FSG's tenure - elements of the H&amp;G reign are still affecting Liverpool as a club today, and part of what made last season's title challenge so special was that it came less than 4 years after we almost went into administration.

[The Anatomy of Liverpool](http://www.amazon.com/The-Anatomy-Liverpool-History-Matches/dp/1409144410) is one I'm reading at the moment. Written by The Guardian's Jonathan Wilson, author of another highly recommended football book called [Inverting The Pyramid](http://www.amazon.com/Inverting-The-Pyramid-History-Tactics/dp/1568587384) (a history of football tactics), The Anatomy of Liverpool picks out 10 matches in the club's history and uses them as the basis to discuss that era of the club - the players, the manager, the seasons, the direction of the club, let alone that match itself. Bear in mind that both this book and Inverting The Pyramid can occasionally be very dry reads, but worth persevering with!

And then, of course, [LFC players' autobiographies](http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/have-you-seen/kop-10-autobiographies-no-10).

I don't believe that the Scottish people, or the Scottish government, is adequately represented in the government in London. I don't believe Scotland will ever prosper or get what it wants under UK rule - the central government is just too powerful.

You don't have any statistical way of measuring how well a player positions themselves (arguably the most vital defensive quality), or of whether they prefer playing a high line and proactively defending vs a deep defensive line and reactively defending.

Having said that, the two reasons we're after Lovren:

- Like Sakho, he's a well-rounded defender - physical, good aerial ability, good enough pace, comfortable enough with the ball at his feet. Agger and Skrtel both struggle with physical CF's, and Agger isn't always the best in the air either. Rodgers' system is very demanding of CBs - because the fullbacks push up and the CB's split, they're covering more space themselves, and therefore you don't see one CB bailing out the other as commonly as at other clubs. So he requires his CBs to individually be good at all aspects of defending.

- Leadership. Southampton's defending improved dramatically this season, with Lovren seen as a big reason for that because of his ability to marshall the defence. Fonte improved dramatically playing next to him, the way Cahill has next to Terry at Chelsea. Given that he's coming from a team that has a very similar style to us, even defensively, Lovren should be able to be the leader of the defence in the way Carra used to be.",0,1404646216,null,0,false,0,ciprqhx,t3_29yhc0,t1_ciprqhx,t1_cipqmyw,null,1434576913,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"&gt; Their stated opposition to gay marriage is that the bill is bad, that it was rushed through the legislature and that it will lead to clergy's religious freedoms being impinged upon via European court cases as soon as someone refuses to officiate a gay wedding.

It's not like I've really kept up with UKIP policy, and if someone could correct me I'd be willing to admit I'm wrong, but it feels like I've seen plenty of examples of UKIP high ups saying why they don't support gay marriage, usually talking about how the bill is poor or something about the EU, but I've seen very few examples of them saying how they'd support it. I can't remember them saying they would rewrite the bill to deal with these concerns. It seems more like they are using those reasons to cover up the fact they are pandering to people who don't want gay marriage full stop, yet know if they opposed it on those grounds, there would be a massive outcry from the public (recent polls are something like 70% support of gay marriage).

true,liamdpt,EN,england,"This article was full of shit, to put it bluntly. If anything the fact that makes him ex-Arsenal only makes things sweeter, yet another Arsenal player will be playing elsewhere in the Premier League, fighting for titles whilst they secure that 4th place trophy again. 

I know it addresses this in the Article but why would they even include that Fabregas could be in decline? The stats may not show it but he was still very good for Barca, may not be up to his Arsenal standards but what do you expect when you struggle to get a run of games going and when you do you're playing the false 9 or thrown out on the wing.

They also talk about how he may not be able to play in the pivot ""due to his less than stellar defensive capabilities"". He's not all that bad defensively, he's not the best but when you're partnering Matic as long as you make the effort to contribute to the defensive side of things, that should be enough. It's not like Lampard was much better defensively, if better at all.

Then it talks about a problem between him and Jose. Like they weren't aware of this ""problem"" themselves before he signed. Obviously the two have cleared the air, it's not like this transfer has been forced upon Mourinho, it's Mourinho's transfer. 90% of problems in football are as simple as players/managers acting out in the heat of the moment and really aren't as big of a deal as people make out.

Let's not forget how this signing will effect the rest of the team. For most, having him there will be a giant lift in itself but one player who will benefit greatly from having Cesc and Diego in the team is Hazard, for two reasons. Firstly, having a player that will more than likely see every run he makes and find a way to get the ball to him along with a striker who can finish the chances Hazard creates, and who he can feed off will really propel him to the peak of his game. Secondly, it will relieve Hazard of so much pressure. On so many occasions last season we found ourselves holding all our hopes in Hazard alone. Everyone would look to get the ball to him and everyone would expect him to make something magic happen every time, which he does have the ability for but it can become very tiring, difficult and stressful, especially when things aren't going his way. Having Costa and Fabregas who could work directly with each other, cutting out the middle man on occasions will be a big thing for us and Hazard. 

All in all Cesc's ability to open defenses with his passing, his goals from midfield and his natural leadership in a very young squad make him the perfect replacement for the legend that is Lampard.

true,TheMysteriousShadow,lfc68,,"I'm glad I finally have somewhere to post this as I've been thinking about it for a while now. I was tempted to post it in /r/soccer but didn't necessarily want hatemail from bitter United fans for days. 

United are resting all their hopes on the shoulders of Van Gaal, who no one can deny has had some great success as a coach. That said, look at *where* he has had success: Ajax, Barcelona, Bayern and the Netherlands national squad. The similarities you will find between all the clubs is that they reside in leagues where they're either *the* favourites or one of them (Ajax are pretty much odds-on to win each year, Barcelona will be somewhere near the top and Bayern are by far the best in the Bundesliga). Hell, even the Netherlands squad right now has some of the most in-form players of the moment (Robben, Sneijder, etc) -- and hardly anyone remembers when he first managed that squad back in 2000, where they did nothing and were terrible. 

Van Gaal, much like Mourinho, is a manager who must have great players and a fair amount of money to truly work wonders at any team. United sure have the money, but until they sort out their defence and midfield, they don't have anywhere near the best team in the PL right now. Some of the less bitter United fans will admit that themselves. Plus, that's not even going into the way Rooney might react to such an dictatorship -- anyone remember that he was on his way out of United because he couldn't handle Fergie? Van Gaal is much worse. 

Add to all that the fact that they don't have CL football, that it's his first season and charge and miracles usually don't happen like that (hence why there was so much furore around our move from 7th to 2nd this season) and that it's already proven extremely difficult for them to tempt massive players there this window (Reus, Sneijder have said no) then they're probably not as likely as United fans think to break back into the top 4.

The Scottish Government actually has no control of oil resources, those are counted as a UK-wide thing and are kept off the Scottish books entirely, it is almost entirely funded from a block grant which says that (roughly) For every pound the UK government spends on an issue (like education or healthcare) that is devolved in Scotland, Scotland will get a proportionate share, so if Scotland is roughly 1/10 the population of England for every pound spent we will get 10p.

It's more a case of the Scottish Government being more careful with the cuts and investing in other areas, when people talk about Free uni in Scotland they always seem to forget to mention the Nurses that have paid for it, or that free prescriptions come about because the cost of administering charges is actually pretty much eaten up by any money made.",0,1404647925,null,0,false,0,cips0ic,t3_29ylz8,t1_cips0ic,t1_ciprm5a,null,1435479562,30,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,30

And BA and friends have had to downgrade to compete with them. That's why they aren't as high-quality as they might have been in the 70s and 80s (although I'd argue they're still better). Not simply because they were privatised. Plus you have foreign competition which might not have been quite so prevalent then (wasn't around, don't know). You'd have no problem using Singapore Airlines over BA today but would you have done in the 80s?

&gt; The railways are still heavily regulated by the government. The government gets to decide on fares increases, who gets new trains, who gets to build the new trains, who gets the cast offs, what Network Rail is allowed to invest in, and where, etc.

That's less a problem of privatisation in general and more to do with the way it was done. We went for the approach of granting long-term franchises, typically to the same large bus operators.

There are ""open access operators"" which get granted the right to operate specific routes - but once again the government approves these, and doesn't tend to approve anything that might compete with an existing franchised operator. First Hull Trains is one of these (and apparently, despite being owned by First, people really like them).

&gt; &gt; benefit claimants

&gt; This one is a little more complex.

You're not really making much sense on this point, the argument is simple, the misinformation distributed by the political/capital class is that there are too many scroungers, then everyone who is on benefits must suffer by cutting benefits because they're far supposedly too generous, which is a outright lie. 

The percentages of fraudulent claims is so damn small, that the excuse for cutting benefits can only be a  political one founded by small groups in power. Now some people might claim this is the media's fault for misreporting, but then you have to ask your self what influences the media? Perhaps the capital class and who controls the primary sources to the mass media. 

Here some data on fraudulent claims:
http://www.cas.org.uk/features/myth-busting-real-figures-benefit-fraud

Also, notice the much larger quantity of other types of fraud.

&gt; &gt; regulations

&gt; The reality is that these safety regulations are expensive to society but do save lives.

I'm very much on the saving lives and protecting the environment instead of the short sighted temporary gains by removing regulations.  Look at workers right for example, does the UK Really want to exist in a state like the USA where no holiday exists, you can be fired with almost no reason etc. Also, regulations help to project society for the future and I believe that is financially far more valuable, because it's shown if businesses and greedy fuckers are allowed to do what they want, they have done and will do with zero mercy.

&gt; &gt; schools

&gt; We have too many exams and too much emphasis on test scores because politics demands statistics to show the media. 

Completely agree on this point. I also think it's important to highlight the fact that there is a distinction between schooling and education, they're are separate concepts, where schools are suppose to educate, which implies giving children the tools and resources to discover HOW to teach them selfs. A teacher once said to me: ""A teacher doesn't teach, the child teaches them selfs"". 

But as you stated, schools are forced to focus on non-educating ideas such as statistics to appease the perception that education must be getting better through matrices which prove almost nothing besides that children are able to mentally copy and paste information. (Which in recent years governments have then said ""Oh GCSEs are getting easier blah blah blah"") The ones who are better the copy/pasting of information, succeed with GCSE's, the ones who might think in more analytical concepts or less conforming methodologies are thrown on the failure heap.

Which begs the question, are the policies imposed by Gove based on science or based on creating 2 level class divide on who CAN pass exams and who CAN'T pass exams, fair to black and white in my opinion.  If I'd been judged on this system alone I'd be considered ""CAN'T"" because I'm not a copy/paster, I need to understand why and through the reasoning of why, come up with an answer. So thank god when I did my GCSE's in the late 90s I was given the opportunity to go to college and learn a vocational ability which I can modestly say I'm reasonable good at, but based on my reading/writing abilities at the age of 16 that would of never been the case in todays system.

&gt; charities

I hate the fact that Charities HAVE to exist, if the system was run correctly the charities for internal affairs should have to exist. It's only the failure of the government and the people that they charities (hacks to problem) are around. Not that I'm anti-charity, but I prefer to ask why they exist.  Instead of putting £100bn into trident, perhaps all those funds could go to increasing the speed of research into major illness and for helping the unfortunate. I know people will call me unrealistic with that idea, but it appears that the foundation to our system creates this problem instead of appeases it.

Final point, i recently spoke with a friend who suggested that the areas of society where most criminal behaviour exists are at the very bottom and very top of societies classes, the very poor steal to eat/live, the very rich strive for power or excitement through subversive methods, where as everyone in-between lives their lives without attempting harm others. It's an interesting idea, not that I'm completely sold on it, but it does beg the question, which groups of people create this problems? I personally am the camp that the very rich and powerful are completely responsible, as if they didn't impose poverty by holding on to their creed the poor would not become more criminalised to feel they have some power in their lives. 

Anyhoo, rant over :)

I just fail to grasp the mentality here. Why do people support a policy that has failed to make your country safer?

It's simply not a sustainable policy and there are far more things you can slightly restrict and probably save more lives.

These are the same people who throw a fit when somebody wants to tax their drink withstanding all the violence it is associated with, because of a few ""drunkards.""

People wanted renationalisation about 30 years after the government nationalised the formerly private rail industry and 20 years before they reprivatised it?

I don't see how people wanting something automatically makes it better. Especially when the people seem oblivious to the reasons behind why something is the way it is. The same people who will moan at oil companies and OPEC when petrol prices go up but not on the government whose taxes comprise something like 80% of the price.

Yes, and if you actually read my comment, I stated that the government plays a large part in the current situation. ""highest train fares in Europe"" don't happen just because the CEO of First wants a few more fifties to light his cigars, the government sets the increases and has worked in recent years to reduce taxpayer subsidy by allowing fares to increase rapidly.

One could equally argue that the capitalist elements of the right all involve forced labour extracted in the form of surplus value, and that we wouldn't even require coercive forms of redistribution if there weren't coercive forms of distribution in the first place.  

People wouldn't have to work (so hard) to live if the State and capitalists didn't conspire to ensure the vast majority only had their labour to sell in rigged markets which were oversupplied with it because they aren't free enough not to.  The commons were destroyed precisely because early capitalists couldn't find willing labour for the prices they wanted to pay, most were content to live lives of (relative) leisure and refused to work to make others rich when they could shelter and feed themselves.

&gt;Whatever the merits of socialism I think the use of the word freedom in your context is deceptive. No doubt some entitlements are a good idea, and some taxes, but not really because of freedom.

I think your use of entitlements and taxes to signify socialism is deceptive, socialism is about workers controlling their own labour and receiving the full fruits of it.  Property is freedom, and the denying of it to the vast majority by State-enforced private property is what makes most people unfree.  Under modern American-style conceptions of ""libertaianism"" and ""anarcho""capitalism, or even old style European notions of classical liberalism and laissez-faire capitalism, what you end up with is corporate fiefdoms where the State is fully privatised into little corporate kingdoms, and everyone is precisely as free as the amount of private property they can amass.

****

&gt; The percentages of fraudulent claims is so damn small

I used to be friends with a guy who's partner was a career benefits cheat, I also worked with a lot of Mandatory Work Assignment candidates and **there is a big difference between a fraudulent claim and fraudulent motives**. A very large number of people, probably not as big as the anti-benefits supporters claim but not as small as you're claiming are living on benefits in a comfortable life and that's the problem. People who pay taxes get annoyed at people living off them and the claimants lack motivation for finding work. People who have never been in that situation say stupid things like ""I'd rather work in McDonalds than be a social parasite"" but you wouldn't. Working a 40 hour week for minimum wage in a job that gives you no respect or self esteem, that drains you physically and mentally is a horrible existence. The people living off benefits aren't lazy, they're just being offered 2 shitty choices in life and picking the one that gives them the better quality of life. The response of society shouldn't be to attack their work ethic, or trying to make being on benefits so unpleasant that a shitty job is a better quality of life, it should be to improve the jobs!


&gt; regulations

I think you're agreeing with me but I'll add in that over regulation makes us uncompetitive globally and whilst the country is doing very well off the financial sector (which is bubble that will one day pop) we need to deregulate areas that affect small manufacturers and tourist industries to ensure our strong future and create jobs outside of London.

No we the masses are completely responsible. If you have ever voted Labour or Conservative, then you did this.

The UK exports around £35 billion a year in military export sales.

And even though we don't domestically produce civil airliners, the UK still has the second largest civil aerospace industry in the world.

true,TechJesus,null,null,"&gt; One could equally argue that the capitalist elements of the right all involve **forced labour extracted in the form of surplus value**, and that we wouldn't even require coercive forms of redistribution if there weren't coercive forms of distribution in the first place.

I assume when you talk of surplus value you refer to the middle men or managerial class taking a profit out of what has taken place. You seem to have fallen for the factory worker's fallacy: the notion that in a factory it is only the workers physically building the products that are engaging in real labour. Yet these workers would not be able to work at all without the initial labour of the managers in purchasing the requisite tools and negotiating distribution of said product, activities that fully entitle them to a share of the profits, even if you dismiss it as the taking of ""surplus value"" of the workers.

&gt; People wouldn't have to work (so hard) to live if the State and capitalists didn't conspire to ensure the vast majority only had their labour to sell in rigged markets which were oversupplied with it because they aren't free enough not to. The commons were destroyed precisely because early capitalists couldn't find willing labour for the prices they wanted to pay, most were content to live lives of (relative) leisure and refused to work to make others rich when they could shelter and feed themselves.

I'd be interested to know what you are referring to in this passage, but this and the below comments fully indicate to me you are not a libertarian, despite you saying otherwise.

&gt; I think your use of entitlements and taxes to signify socialism is deceptive, socialism is about workers controlling their own labour and receiving **the full fruits** of it. 

What exactly is meant by the phrase ""the full fruits""? Socialists tend to say that workers should get a ""fair share"" of the profits of a given company based on how much work each person is doing, usually at the expense of the managers or proprietors of the firm (which can often by the same thing). Yet as I've said above, this is to ignore the initial financial risk that many businessmen have to take in order to set up a company, plus the subsequent risks to keep it sustainable.

A businessman who opens a shop must pay its staff well in advance of taking any profits, as well as suppliers and distributors. Considering the difficulty of keeping a business viable ([according to the ONS of businesses created in 2007 almost half closed within four years](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-329345)) this is not trivial. 

&gt; **Property is freedom, and the denying of it to the vast majority by State-enforced private property is what makes most people unfree**. Under modern American-style conceptions of ""libertarianism"" and ""anarcho""capitalism, or even old style European notions of classical liberalism and laissez-faire capitalism, what you end up with is corporate fiefdoms where the State is fully privatised into little corporate kingdoms, and everyone is precisely as free as the amount of private property they can amass. This will make the vast majority of the planet slaves, or at best, serfs if your corporate master is particularly enlightened.

Property has to be protected by somebody, and most would agree it is better if the state does that than hired goons. For property to be meaningful it must also involve the denial of access to it for others, so your sentence as a whole is self-contradictory. Either you believe in property or you don't, but at least be clear on the matter.

While you characterise Anglo-American capitalism as equivalent of crony capitalism, it is noticeable that in real terms American and British citizens are among the wealthiest in the world. By real terms I mean in terms of property that they own. Even people who we call deprived or, misleadingly, impoverished, will often have access to technology, food and travel that a century ago would have been beyond the reach of the richest men in our society.

&gt;__Alan Mathison Turing__, OBE, FRS (/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/ *__TEWR__-ing*; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was a British mathematician, [logician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic), [cryptanalyst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis), philosopher, [computer scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist), mathematical biologist, and marathon and ultra distance runner. He was highly influential in the development of [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), providing a formalisation of the concepts of ""[algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm)"" and ""[computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation)"" with the [Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine), which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer.    Turing is widely considered as the ""[Father](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_considered_father_or_mother_of_a_scientific_field) of Theoretical Computer Science and [Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence)*. *

true,bloggerheads,null,null,"OK, I have edited my entry to address your concerns.

Let's roll back to what I/we can say with certainty:

Admins at Ummah.com have declared the IP address 195.234.240.212 to be the ""registration IP""; I take this to be the address used to create this account (i.e. and not necessarily the IP address used when posting these messages). In any case, the account is very new (no more than 6 days old) and has only been used to post one message.

It is possible that this claim is not accurate. It is also possible that the DMG network was somehow compromised in a manner that allowed an outsider to use it to register an account at Ummah.com and/or post a message at Ummah.com using a DMG IP address. And finally, while it is possible that a DMG journalist was directly responsible, it is equally likely that some other DMG staffer did this, and not a journalist.

I know the Daily Mail have a long history of xenophobic shit-stirring and tarnishing the image of particular individuals and minorities they don't like (and that they have used less-than-honest methods towards these ends), but this does not strike me as the sort of behaviour that a bona fide journalist would engage in. It is not only low-yield, it is high risk. Behaviour of this sort is in my experience the work of people on the fringes. I would add tot his that the people I am aware of who do this usually seek to offset the risk by pretending to be someone else when they do it.

Here I would like to stray back to the IP data long enough to point out that it does not always resolve back to 'richard.ferrer.dailymail.co.uk'; using two different lookups, I got the results 'david.williams.dailymail.co.uk' and 'tim.intergration.dailymail.co.uk'; repeating the search with a single lookup provider I got a further variation of 'rejblog.dailymail.co.uk' and then 'bootblog.dailymail.co.uk'

From ECE 22 (paragraph 4.1.1):

&gt; indication of the size and, if appropriate, an indication of the 
&gt; unsuitability of the lower face cover to offer any protection 
&gt; against impacts to the chin.

That's all that needs to be displayed on the helmet itself. Mine says ""Bell"" and ""S"" for Small, so that's fine.

More interesting information follows:
 
    5.1.4. 
    In addition to the marks described in paragraph 4.1.1. above, 
    the following particulars shall be indicated on every protective 
    helmet conforming to a type approved under this Regulation by 
    means of the labels referred to in paragraph 5.1.9. below:

    5.1.4.1.1.
    A circle surrounding the letter ""E"" followed by the 
    distinguishing number of the country which has granted 
    approval, 3/ 

Check the chinstrap - mine is marked E3 in a circle, which means it was approved to 22.05 in Italy.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Most importantly the Bank of England. Setting up a new currency will be too risky for iScotland and their EU accession process too lengthy, complex and uncertain to use the Euro any time soon, so the only option is the pound.



If they use the pound, that will either be in the context of a formal currency union with the rest of the UK or in a unilateral informal union. The latter is a system only employed by a couple of countries in the world - Panama I think is one. It is also highly dangerous in the context of divergent political spheres, which is sort of by definition what independence would be.


One of the important things about iScotland's currency future is the fact that Scotland has a large financial services industry that requires insurance, in the form of a central bank, against possible future liquidity crises. The only way to have a central bank is to have one's own currency or to defer to another country's in a formal currency union.



All three major UK parties have ruled out any post-independence formal currency union, so it is not an option for iScotland. Salmond has not yet addressed this.



Loads of people have written on this in a lot of detail and can probably explain it better than me but the central issue is that iScotland wouldn't have a choice but to use the pound, and therefore wouldn't have a choice but to rely on the Bank of England.

LVG loves Van Persie, but I think RVP won't be the force he was 2 years ago, meaning he'll still probably score a good bit, but just like in this World Cup, will be peripheral a lot. Think RVP having the managers attention will put Rooney out of position, where he will throw a strop and generally not play that great, like he always does when he's even mildly inconvenienced. Think Mata was a weird signing, not sure how they fit him, Rooney and RVP into a team. There's been no rhyme or reason to their signings of late, think they have a lot of square pegs in round holes. Then again, perhaps LVG can come up with a system that incorporates in all the players and maximises their strengths. I just feel that such a system doesn't exist and Mata, Rooney and RVP don't do enough work off the ball for them to really cut it at the top any more.

If you're not yet a tax-payer but expect to be in the future, it's probably still worth taking advantage of you annual ISA allowance as that money can then grow tax free from there on (unless they change the law).

(The situation with stocks and shares in ISAs is a little more complicated.)

I think what they mean is that the money in the regular saver ISA will be transferred to a conventional (not regular saver) ISA account. Presumably this is because they will no longer pay you the ""regular saver"" rate of interest on that balance after the end of the ""regular saving"" period. You might well want to then transfer that ISA balance from the conventional ISA they transfer it to to a better deal, when the time comes.

(Note, ""transfer"" means doing an ISA transfer by contacting the provider of the destination ISA account and having them arrange it - if you try to withdraw and re-deposit the money in a different account it will take up more of your annual ISA allowance.)

Maybe the Suarez situation is halting moves out while the transfer committee is preoccupied, or maybe Suso saw a star leaving and thought he might have a shot of getting some playing time while we're trying to fill the holes. I could see Suso participating in pre-season/friendlies to feel things out before a decision is made.

I think he would have a place in the squad next season. We're still lacking in depth on the wings even with the addition of Lallana. If things stay as they are (and Suarez leaves), we didn't really add any depth to our bench (which is what Suso would be at this stage) in the attacking mid department.

If we set up like

                              Gerrard
                          Hendo Coutinho
                  Sterling    Sturridge    Lallana
in the front 6, I can see Suso easily getting time both off the bench and in rotations for Sterling or Coutinho in a more advanced position. Suso's position really seems like it's dependent on who we bring in. If Lazar and Shaqiri come, things are starting to look ominous for Suso, even if they aren't all in the exact same position. At the same time, youngsters like Tex and Ibe are fighting for playtime too, so it isn't going to be easy for Suso. Is Suso up for it or would he prefer someplace like Porto where he can develop at his pace?

I am not saying that anyone who has played in the PL is proven, Cissokho most certainly showed that thats not the case. What I am saying is that one solid + one great season most definitely makes them proven. Do you not see the difference there? Downing was poor, but he was still able to but in average performances every week, as apposed to Aspas whom barely got playing time. Robinho is the best example I can think of right now, as a player who was absolutely shit in the PL despite being a very expensive foreign player.

And yes, Sahko was ""fine"" (although I would argue that Flanno was our second best defender last season), but no were near the beast he was at PSG, or the beast he is playing for France. Do you not think Sahko can improve significantly for us? He needed a season to adapt, and I am confident he will be a lot better for us this season.

This is simply how it is, and something that effects a players price. If it didn't matter it wouldn't effect the prices would it? I have just tried to explain to you the reasoning behind it, and weather or not you agree with it is ultimately irrelevant.

Also, you said there were cheaper and better CBs available, and I asked you who, not if you think we should get fullbacks. There is a reason for why we are targeting Lovren, as he is the leader we lack in our defence. Carra left a huge gap when he retired that was unappreciated, and we need a CB with leadership qualities that can fill that gap. Sakho might be able to do so in a season or two, but he still needs time to adapt and gain confidence (which is exactly what I am talking about).

The general  problem is that the future is unwritten. There is no clarity on many issues whether a Yes or a No vote.

&gt;with regards the pound

Full clarity is impossible on currency as it's down to post-vote negotiations. It's in both sides interests to claim their position as absolute or non-negotiable.

However, there's plenty of detail about the five different options and their pros and cons. Take a read of the fiscal commission report. 

&gt; the armed forces. 

The white paper is actually very clear on the makeup of a Scottish defence force, as well as on allowing Scottish citizens to serve in the UK army.

&gt;Additionally what will happen for science funding.

The white paper proposes keeping the UK-wide research funding model in place. The head of Research Council UK (RCUK) also favours keeping the current UK-wide research area in place whatever the result. The only people saying that this can't happen are the UK government, primarily because they want your No vote. I'd expect pragmatism to win out in event of a Yes vote.

&gt; however I'm pro electoral reform

I don't know how much attention you paid to the AV referendum a couple of years ago, but that should tell you a lot about the chances for electoral reform as part of the UK. We were told that a No vote didn't mean no reform, it meant that we'd explore the alternative options for reform... that PR was possible in the future...  

The No vote was delivered, and all reform discussion was killed stone dead. 

For another example, just look at all the intended reforms of the House of Lords over the past 100 years and see how little reform has taken place.

Scotland, on the other hand, starts with 1 chamber, elected by Proportional Representation. It's a far cry from the UK model, or anything the UK model is likely to reform to *in your lifetime*.

Sahko had a few injuries and played most of his games against the harder opponents. I feel like he had a good season and was definetly better than Flannagan who is a very limited player at the minute. Maybe he wasn't as good as he is for France or PSG but like i say, injuries and lack of playing time will do that.

Sahko is capable of becoming that leader, Agger already could be, so could Kolo. I dont think we should be signing a CB because we need a leader to replace Carragher. Carragher barely got a game in Kennys last season and we had the 3rd best defence in the league, Carragher going isn't the cause of our defence being poor, it's loss of good defense coaches and a system that by it's very nature will lead to conceding a greater amount of goals.",0,1404660355,null,0,false,0,cipv4nn,t3_29u5d4,t1_cipv4nn,t1_cipup4l,null,1434578817,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,Kesuke,null,null,"I think ""Neverendums"" are a significant risk post-No... but I don't think it will happen for several reasons;

* Quebec gets cited as the classic example of a never-endum... but it's also worth remembering that **despite** the referendums they are still a part of Canada.

* Most of the current wave of anti-UK sentiment in Scotland developed in the mid 1980s, after the 1979 devolution referendum. Before that the pro-indy lot were a relatively small and benign movement. What really boosted their numbers was the effect of rapid de-industrialisation across the UK, which as we all know had a huge impact on the North that was more manageable in the economically diverse South. This idea that it is simply inevitable that ""*Nothing will change*"" might not necessarily be the case. It's certainly true that Scotland is more prosperous now than it was 15 years ago, and I am yet to see any compelling evidence to suggest devolution is ultimately responsible for that. If anything, Scotland (like most of the North-UK) is in the midst of a slow ongoing recovery resulting from major economic restructuring that has been taking place since the 1980s. 

* Further to my above point, it seems almost inevitable that there **will** be significant change post-referrendum, most likely in the area of tax and spend. Westminster politicians feel it is unfair that they have to bear the brunt of raising finances through unpopular taxes and spending whilst Holyrood, and in particular the incumbent SNP party, have all the benefits of being able to spend money that Westminster has raised through unpopular taxation. In a tidy example; Westminster increases road fund tax, Holyrood provides free education. Holyrood needs to be put in a position where it's politicians are made responsible for both tax and spend. That way Holyrood aren't just angels of spending - and when Scots go to the polls to vote for the SNP they can do it on the knowledge that it will mean higher taxes for high earners in order to pay for things like free education... now a lot of people will support that, but some won't. It means over time the shape of the Holyrood parliament is more likely to work the way it was intended, as a diverse coalition rather than a single incumbent party. Hopefully it will shift political activism in Scotland away from things like Independence which whilst seemingly exciting, are unlikely to offer real positive change... and instead can focus on more achievable localist causes that Scots care about... the redevelopment of cities, infrastructure, culture, education spending etc.

**Tl;dr: This notion that Scotland are on some sort of inevitable march towards independence, even if it doesn't happen this time, really isn't inevitable. Infact, we might be looking at what ultimately comes to be seen as the peak of the separatist movement.** ",1,1404662857,null,0,1404663103,0,cipw1jx,t3_29ylz8,t1_cipw1jx,t1_ciprsov,null,1434579081,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

[Herald Scotland](http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/one-devastating-fantasy-the-impact-of-an-internet-scandal.2012066675)

[Vice](http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/hollie-greig-freemasons-scotland-paedophile-ring)

Both make it fairly clear that there is no evidential basis for the specific accusations against named individuals and it does appear to be a conspiracy theory. The Vice article mentions that an attempted BBC investigation into the story (presumably for something like Panorama) fairly quickly came to the conclusion that it's fabricated and just isn't a story. Add to that the fact that support for this comes from such reliable people as David Icke and the BNP, claiming it's a masonic conspiracy, and it'd take something remarkable for me not to write it all off as simply untrue.

It looks like while the girl involved probably was abused by someone at some point, an assortment of people have taken advantage of this and turned it into something much more, ruining others' lives in the process.

In order to bring a case there needs to be enough evidence to secure a conviction, which itself will be have to be beyond reasonable doubt. The best that either of the two reliable sources can come up with is that on the balance of probabilities she was probably abused. This creates two major issues:

1. This doesn't even guarantee that there's enough evidence to convince a jury beyond reasonable doubt that she was abused, so you may not even be able to prove that a crime was committed.

2. Who do you bring the case against? Proof that someone was abused is not proof of who abused them. Even if you can overcome the hurdle posed by 1 (above) you still need to prove that the specific person you've charged was responsible, and you need to prove that again beyond reasonable doubt.

Honestly, it's sad that so many conspiracy theorists appear to have waylaid this, because it possibly could be a bit clearer without the accusations of a masonic pedo ring.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;operates on the assumption that they'll get more than 10% of all military 

Well firstly, the White Paper works by naturally assuming 10% of absolutely everything in each of the fields. They don't actually want to end up with the full 10% outlined in this field (I'll explain why a bit further down).

You start with a pile of assets and a pile of liabilities. On each different issue you both argue your ground but then make common sense decisions and compromises (so for example, if the army had something at a surplus they could give it and take the inheritance over 10% and if it's the opposite then they could take it and go under the 10%).

There may well be areas like the BBC for example where more than 10% of the assets lie in Scotland. In this case, it would be illogical for Westminster to hold onto them so they would naturally let go in exchange for something else.

At the end of the process they will sum up who has more liabilities to assets and change debt levels accordingly.

It's not in their interests to get everything they are actually haggling for. They would find it quite convenient to need to build a few things (just to give an artificial boom to the economy for the early years where things will be tough).

There will be some things retained, some things built locally and some things built abroad (for cost effectiveness).

Defence is one of the areas that the Scottish Government put significantly more into than is spent in Scotland itself so they can look to spend a little less and get a bit more out of it (Although, maybe sacrifices will be made elsewhere).

On industry jobs they argue that the contracts would continue (which they would) and at their expiry they could try and draw more in afterwards. There isn't that much planned for when the current contracts end so it's probably likely that there will be much deeper job losses anyway. That's another reason why they don't actually want the 10% figure.

This White Paper is more of a haggling document in my eyes. I was pretty shocked that they never articulated their vision on currency very well though. If they'd went into it and outlined their first choice with other options from the Fiscal Commission and not used language that was trying to dictate another Government then they wouldn't have got such a big back lash.

Considering that the mop headed fellow at CFC went for £48m and set the market price then Lovren at £20m-£25m is somewhat of a bargain in comparison as he is in no way 1/2 the player Luiz or at least i imagine that is what the Soton office would be saying.

true,gav135x,null,null,"A lot of the problems were fixable though, not immediately of course but some of them could easily be fixed within a year. The main problems (IMO) were the tactics (and attitude), midfielders, defenders, the aging squad and injuries. 

Moyes tactics were absolutely awful at times. The most obvious example is the Fulham game where it was non-stop crossing and when that didn't work he threw every attacker on leaving only a few defenders at the end. Then on numerous occasions he tried to defend a 1-0 lead (with a defensively poor side) only to concede from a set piece or a silly deflection. This led to more draws which didn't usually happen under fergie (5 draws in 2012/13, 2 of them after the league was already won). Van Gaal should be a big improvement in tactics and attitude although it may take a while for him to implement his style.

The midfield was poor and hasn't been united strength in years. The difference was that a Carrick/Cleverley partnership won the league under Fergie. Fellaini was injured and was played IMO out of position when fit and a carrick/fellaini midfield has no movement at all. Herrera should help with bringing more movement and creativity to the midfield, although if he is the only midfielder brought in, the midfield will still struggle.

The defence was poor this year in comparison to previous years, although it wasn't the main problem. United won the league in 2012/13 conceding 43 goals and finished 7th last year conceding the same amount, the difference was that they scored 22 goals less, which is in part down to tactics and part due to injuries to the strikers and out of form wingers.

The starting 11 last year included a 35 year old Rio, 32 Y.O Vidic, a 33 Y.O Evra and a 32 Y.O Carrick. Vidic, Evra and especially Rio declined last season and made a lot more errors. Evra in particular lacked the legs to get back into position after attacking and was caught out quite a lot which wasn't helped by playing behind an inexperienced player in Januzaj. This year Evra will likely be backup to Shaw who while inexperienced will still be an upgrade on last seasons Evra. Another CB needs to be bought though because the current CBs are either young or quite injury prone (or both).

Evans who was Uniteds best CB in 2012/13 was injured and only played about 20 games, and it was a similar case with Rafael. This meant Jones or Smalling had to be played in RB (usually Jones) which meant either Rio or Smalling had to be first choice CB with Vidic, which didn't really work too well. RVP was also injured a lot, only playing 21 games. While no one can know for sure whether the injury situation will improve, it was quite a freak year (for united, still not as bad as arsenal) with regards to the amount of injuries in one year. 

The average age of the squad was 27ish last year and alot of the older players were starers. This year Giggs, Vidic, Rio and maybe Fletcher will all be leaving so the average age should be lower and the squad should in theory be fitter and less injury prone.

The other issue, if the papers are to be believed, was that Moyes lost the players because they didn't respect him or take him seriously which shouldn't really happen with LVG

I don't think LVG will be an instant fix that puts united back into title winning form but i do feel a lot of the problems last year were either overstated or caused by Moyes/his tactics.",0,1404667314,null,0,false,0,cipxu7n,t3_29yn3r,t1_cipxu7n,t1_cipvpw9,null,1434579934,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

He had reportedly told his family that it would “blow the lid off” the lives of the most well-known and influential child abusers.

&gt;Mr Dickens’ son, Barry, has told the BBC  that his father, who died in 1995, would have been “hugely angered, disappointed and frustrated” if he knew that his revelations had not been acted upon.

&gt;He said: “My father thought that the dossier at the time was the most powerful thing that had ever been produced, with the names that were involved and the power that they had.”

&gt;Barry also went on to detail how the burglaries of his father’s London flat and constituency home in Greater Manchester following the allegations amounted to nothing being taken.

&gt;""They weren't burglaries,"" he said. ""They were break-ins for a reason. We can only presume they were after something that Dad had that they wanted.""

So, both his homes were burgled, nothing was taken.  I will assume that this is fact as I doubt his son would make up something so easily disproven.

They attacked because we had nothing there. They lost because we moved some shit there. We would have won more or less regardless of what we moved there.

Whilst it can be useful to have a carrier that can take aircraft to bomb wherever you need. That hasn't been the case late into their lifetimes.

I mostly think that today, in the age of the internet, a direct democracy in which we all vote say 4 times a year for a list of policies would more effectively pass liberal policies without having to compromise with political parties.

The more I see of Liverpool this summer, the more I think they might be in for a rude awakening in the CL/Prem next year when people are more ""ready"" for them; I think people took them a little lightly at the beginning of last year, and by the time teams realized how good they were, they had played 10 fewer games than all their nearest competitors, and the other top teams were all too tired to really exploit their weaknesses. This year, they won't sneak up on anyone, and they'll have to play at least 2/3 of the CL group stage without Suarez, if they even keep him.

I think you are thinking in terms of X,000 numbers of men... I'm thinking more above that - as these days forces are built up less around raw numbers of infantry, airmen and sailors and more about the skillsets available to them. It would, for example, be no use having an airforce without air traffic controllers, ground based satellite image analysts, machinists, aeronautical engineers etc. The problem is, the Scots a) Cannot guarantee there are even Scottish personnel in the British forces who posses those skills at the required levels of expertise (both senior and junior) and b) that those personnel would even want to relocate to a Scottish force which has already branded itself as a minimal pacifist defensive force provided at the lowest cost with the least drive to actually get involved in anything particularly exciting.

You don't join an army so you can run around hills in Scotland with fake rifles wearing face paint... you do it so you can feel like you've become something elite, that you're a professional, and ultimately one that might fight in an actual war.

What I would say, is that defending Scottish defense ambitions is fair enough... an iScotland doesn't need to be a global policeman with a huge airforce of 5th generation stealth jets, drones and division upon division of armored infantry ready to pour across Europe into Russia. Nobody anticipates that... however, Defending the SNPs white paper is just baseless. It was a joke that nobody in the defense community, Scottish or otherwise took seriously. Virtually every paragraph of it just reads like it was written by an amateur lacking in even the most basic understanding of defense matters. It was like reading an A-level students impression of how defense in an independent Scotland might work... well intentioned, but hopelessly naive and lacking.

**Tl:Dr; Don't defend the SNP Defense White Paper just because you're Scottish or Pro-Independence and you think it's patriotic or some rubbish like that. It was an embarrassing publication that nobody took seriously.**",1,1404672313,null,0,1404672494,0,cipzymy,t3_29ylz8,t1_cipzymy,t1_cipzlsv,null,1434580938,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

I particularly like ""He described Caltongate as “another “architectural embarrassment in the making.""  
 
 Also the text in [this](https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/caltongate-petition) petition makes probably the most vital points, such as ""The proposed development represents a grave threat to the UNESCO World Heritage status of the Old Town due to inappropriate and insensitive design that is contrary to local planning guidelines."" and ""Inexcusable neglect of listed buildings within the World Heritage designation, including council housing fronting on to the Royal Mile and the Canongate Venture building.""    
 
 Basically it's an area with so much history, where you can look in every direction and see the Royal Mile, Calton Hill, essentially the whole personality of Edinburgh's architectural history summed up in one area, and this very *large* development will basically create an eyesore in the middle of that.

Oh you know, plodding along as per usual; not boiling my skin off for The Man and have access to good beer within, oh, a two-minute walk? I'd have a bit more sympathy if I didn't know you're earning a gazillion pounds per hour.

&gt;Any more trips to France?

I was there for my mum's 60th in March, which was pretty shit. I had to be in the same room as my estranged sister for 12 hours and stupidly chose to remain sober (although watching her sober just cemented the decision I'd already made); I also got hit on by my mum's fucking pervy vertically-challenged middle-aged French friend *in front of his wife*, so that was fun. However, I bought her the best present so I was best daughter, and she was glad that I made it despite not talking to my sister for three years. 

In terms of future trips my yank BFF is talking about coming over for Christmas, and after he sadly lost his mother recently and is now an orphan, I'm thinking 'bout taking him to Paris for a jolly and then to my folks house in the countryside for Christmas. I'm keen for them to adopt him as a surrogate son as I know they will get on brilliantly, and I suspect the reason he's moved his trip from March to December is to be around me for Christmas as he... well, he no longer has any family left really.

It's 3 times the size of ours, 11% of the stuff we sell is to Germany but only 6% of the stuff they sell is to us. We need them more than they need us. 

There has to be areas that are really important to us but not at-all important to Germany. Stuff we *need* them to keep buying but they could easily just get from somewhere else. Like good old British cheese. If some euro-suit dreamt one night that it'd be great to ban the types of cheese we happen to make and sell to the continent we'd be against that. It would hurt our economy. Whilst Germany just think *""Whatever, we'll buy more from the dutch instead, no biggie*"". 

**Inside** the EU we can just veto it, or get exemptions. We might piss off the dutch a little bit but ultimately it's problem solved and our cheese keeps selling.

**Outside** the EU we have to negotiate and play the big ole game of politics where we threaten to stop buying their cars unless they drop the cheese issue. We need to sit at the table and play our hand and that's where the problem comes in. Our hand, in comparison to the EU as a whole, isn't a world beater. 

Sure it's a damn sight better than what Ghana (or whoever) are playing with and we have a few nice cards up our sleeves, we've got great access to commonwealth nations and a better connection to the US but those are only going to win us *some* of the card games. Veto wins every time.

In addition to that the longer we stay out and the more games we lose the more likely it is that our hand gets weaker. If our go-to threat is to get our yank pals to not be your friend anymore then eventually they'll just focus on being better friends with the Americans than we are and ignore our threats entirely. You *might* even argue that the Americans only like us so much because we're an easy way into the EU for them. 'Special friendships' only exist as long as they are useful.

Lovren's defense partner in Lyon was Milan Biševac, Serbian, and I know they are really good friends, so he's ok too.

As for Shaqiri and Marković, that is a tough one. Shaqiri went to Switzerland when he was 1 year old, and there's a good chance he is indifferent about Kosovo. Lazar was a kid when the bombing happened in '99 and a teenager when Kosovo's independence was declared in '08. He might also not care.

Most of the other rail companies don't run an exclusively profitable intercity service with no rural commuter trains to subsidise, and they are expected to make investments whereas a caretaker franchise like East Coast is not. Most of the ""investments"" on the East Coast patch can be attributed to Network Rail.

Despite being ""profitable"", it is still a subsidy recipient compared to some other companies which pay a net premium to government. And as for praising high profits, those come off of the back of high fares. Which you are complaining about further down the post. If EC used their high profits to reduce fares it'd be commendable. But they aren't. 

&gt; Will nationalisation sort it out? Well privatisation hasn't so it is worth a shot. 

Not unless the government reverses years of subsidy cuts in favour of allowing fares to increases, and not unless the government chooses to invest in rail. Everything the privatised rail industry does is mostly decided by the government - from fares increases to where and who can invest in what.

One thing we need to sort out is the bureaucracy. Nationalisation alone won't fix that, because rail decisions will still be made by politicians and involve politics. They'll still choose to underinvest and concentrate investment in specific areas (e.g. the North which seems to have been noticed by the government) while lacking in others (the railway line to the SW can fall into the sea but we're not going to get a replacement. And it's so slow a car can beat it).

Nationalisation alone will fix the stupid franchise system (unless Labour goes down its current route of ""allowing"" state owned companies to bid, which has so many holes in it it's unbelievable). How the fuck does it cost 30 million quid or whatever to bid for and sort out the mess from the West Coast debacle.

true,raked456,null,null,"Yes it is totally worth it. The debt from university loans is unlike any other debt you will acquire in your life.

 First of all you should not see it as a debt but as investment into your future, there a huge gap in the average wages between those who have degrees and those who do not and gaining a degree will open lots of doors for you.

Secondly, if you earn less than 21k per year you never have to pay a penny of the loan back and after 30 years the entire loan is wiped off. So even you go to university and you don't succeed or do as well as you expect too or choose to go into a career that doesn't pay very well you don't have a debt hanging over you.

Thirdly, the loans are payed off in a very progressive way. As you earn more money, above the 21k threshold, you pay back more money of the loan per month, which is equal to 9% of your wage above that 21k. So if you earn 25k, you pay back just £30 a month (or £160 per year) or if you earn 60k, you pay back £262 a month. 

Fourthly, any loan left over after 30 years if wiped off.

I would strongly advise you ignore the fear mongering around student debts and hopefully you will see university is entirely affordable for anyone and that nobody should be scared away because of this high level of debt. This is because even if you do fail after you leave you will never have to pay it back, and even if you are less successful throughout your career you only pay a figure relative to the amount of money you're earning.

So in reality you will never notice it being taken. Furthermore, the average graduate earns more than those who did not go into higher education (remember this is on average though). £50,000 seems a lot to me, as tuition fees are £9,000 per year so unless your course is around 5 years (which again is possible), that would seem a bit much. Also, maintenance loans, the loan you get to live off, do not need to be paid back. 

You can also apply for bursaries and several universities offer high achievers scholarships which help massively. I wouldn't base my decision on whether to go to University on the fact that you will have to pay back a lot of money, because in reality, a student loan is the best loan you will ever receive. Also, if you don't pay it off within 30 years, it gets cancelled. I think there are also certain criteria where you can wipe the debt - IIRC if you move abroad for a certain length of time it can be removed.

You need to ask yourself if you're going to uni because you genuinely want or because you're not sure what to do with yourself. Because if you are not sure what to do with life maybe you're better of not committing to a massive debt straight away and instead spending some time trying to figure yourself out.
Getting college leavers into uni is an industry now, institutions get paid good money for sending as many students as they can. So try making this decision with a clear head. 

If you're middle class it probably does not matter that much though, you can always drop out and your parents will help you out.

Tell me more about the great influence we wield within the EU!

It's true that within the EEA we'd have to adopt some EU law anyway, but to quote from the relevant Wikipedia article:

&gt; The EEA is based on the same ""four freedoms"" as the European Community: the free movement of goods, persons, services, and capital among the EEA countries. Thus, the EEA countries that are not part of the EU enjoy free trade with the European Union.

&gt; As a counterpart, these countries have to adopt part of the Law of the European Union. However they also contribute to and influence the formation of new EEA relevant policies and legislation at an early stage as part of a formal decision-shaping process.[6]

&gt; Agriculture and fisheries are not covered by the EEA. It has been important for Norway and Iceland to protect themselves from the Common Fisheries Policy, which would be very negative for them, a major reason not to join the EU.

Allow me to calculate how upset the British fishing industry would be if the rest of the EU lost their free access to our waters.

[Working Time Regulations 1998, section 10](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1998/1833/regulation/10/made)
&gt; 10.  (1)  An adult worker is entitled to a rest period of not less than eleven consecutive hours in each 24-hour period during which he works for his employer. 

Note that there are no qualifications there about ""unless it's a 24 hour business"" - that's irrelevant.  If they can't cover their shifts without breaking that, they need more employees.

10 days in a row does, unfortunately, appear to be OK.

From what I can see, the relevant law is the [Working Time Regulations 1998, section 11](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1998/1833/regulation/11/made), which reads:
&gt; 11.  (1)  Subject to paragraph (2), an adult worker is entitled to an uninterrupted rest period of not less than 24 hours in each seven-day period during which he works for his employer.

&gt; (2) If his employer so determines, an adult worker shall be entitled to either—

&gt; (a)two uninterrupted rest periods each of not less than 24 hours in each 14-day period during which he works for his employer; or

&gt; (b)one uninterrupted rest period of not less than 48 hours in each such 14-day period,

&gt; in place of the entitlement provided for in paragraph (1). 

If you have day off - 10 days on - day off, I think that satisfies ""two uninterrupted rest periods each of not less than 24 hours in each 14-day period during which he works for his employer"" providing that they do both involve 24 hours of not working.

Keegan, Dalglish, McManaman, Suarez - all world class players with the number 7 shirt. On the other hand I can't name a single top quality player to wear a number 23 for a good chunk of his career at any club, let alone Liverpool. Fowler wore it, but only until he could have 9 on the back of his shirt. Carra made 23 his.

Quite a while ago Palestinian flags went up in republican areas to welcome a visiting Palestinian figure. The instant those went up, the Israeli flags were straight up in the loyalist areas. (Tony Blair mentions this incident in the Northern Ireland bit in his autobiography)

There are some links, mind - There have been links between Republicans here and the PLO &amp; Palestinian Authority, as well as Unionists and the Zionist Movement and Israel. Peter Robinsons famous photo of him with a rifle was taken during a 'fact finding' mission to Israel.

Going into nutjob territory, There are also those (such as Nelson McCausland) that believe British Protestants are a lost tribe of Israel, and this is a promised land for them. (Being promised to them by the monarchy, who are descended from God). The flag you see where the Star of David is superimposed on the star of the Ulster Banner might be inspired by this.

Other politicans such as Sammy Wilson openly support the treatment of Palestinians by Israel, and have stated that they wish the British Government had treated Catholics the same, which may be another motivation.

More recently, the American idea that Israel must be supported in order that the next temple be built, thus bringing about the end times, seems to be taking hold a little in the more fundamentalist churches, although I don't know if thats influencing the flying of flags. 

All bullshit of course. The irony is Israel was fighting against the British for its independence, some of those early figures looked to the Irish for inspiration (Yitzhak Shamir gave himself a nickname based on Michael Collins). And the histories of the places post creation have been extremely different. Northern Ireland wasn't surrounded by hostile and aggressive states trying to wipe it out by force for most of it's existence, for a start.

Technically Carragher was nothing special, it was his understanding of the game and, whilst less relevant to this particular argument, his desire and will to win that made him into one of the best defenders to ever grace the hallowed Anfield turf. Carragher remains a student of the game and has all the tools to be a successful future manager; just listen to him talk tactics on MNF, for instance, and you can start to see the man's deep knowledge of our sport as it was in the past, as it is today and how it promises to be in the future.

You probably could make a case that 1972 was a civil war, more specifically Summer or July 1972 but you cannot call the conflict as a whole a war. The only reason why you would call it as such would be to try to legitimise the IRA's campaign.

I commend him for leading the Republican movement towards non-violent methods but that doesn't excuse the hundreds of people who lost their lives due to a movement that he was a part of.

He didn't save 1000's of lives. By the 90's the conflict was claiming the lives of a few dozen people a year and that was because paramilitaries on either side had received new arms and the Loyalist paramilitaries had a new, younger and more ruthless leadership. These arms would of course of been used up and the leadership of the Loyalist paramilitaries would most likely of turned out like their predecessors. It is of my opinion the conflict would have been at a lull like the mid 80's and then would of fizzled out but would have still remained. Kinda like how the Israeli Palestinian conflict is at the moment. People are still being killed however not in the same numbers as either of the Intifadas. The population by the 90's was tired and war wary. The conflict would have diminished regardless of Gerry Adams' involvement or lack of.

Can anyone shed any light on this?

mirror link also says the same thing.. that said surely he won't want to languish on the bench for chelsea at his stage of development... right ?

http://www.tribalfootball.com/articles/not-so-fast-liverpool-chelsea-have-lazar-markovic-deal-place-4012016#.U7nAKfldXD8

according to this, chelsea can have him for as little as £12.5m, meaning that.. potentially they could offer him ridiculous wages (as he's obviously worth a lot more than that..)

With regard to research funding, Scotland currently gets 13% of research council funding despite not contributing this much to general taxation that pays for it. After independence the UK government will not agree to pay more out than Scotland pays into a common research council because that would be political suicide. To maintain the current spending in Scotland the government would have to spend a greater proportion of tax money on it.

On top of this, all the Scottish universities will lose the fees they get from non-Scottish UK students (I know it has been said that they could still charge them but assuming Scotland remains in the EU it just won't be possible, it would take 1 court case to overturn). As the number of Scottish (and EU) students that the Scottish government will pay for is capped this will further reduce research funding. It is unlikely this could be filled by an increase in international students that can be charged as much as a uni likes because unis already don't turn away any international students that are qualified enough.

The last thing that's not been mentioned much in public is that a lot of funding comes from charities and there's nothing stopping them only funding within the remaining UK where they generate their income.

Liverpool’s preparations for life without Luis Suárez have led to them closing in on deals for Lazar Markovic and Divock Origi and intensifying their efforts to convince Alexis Sánchez to be a makeweight in the move that will take the Uruguay international to Barcelona.

A fee of about £25 million is close to being agreed with Benfica for Markovic, the Serbia winger, and Liverpool are hopeful that the deal will be completed this week. Markovic has attracted strong interest from Chelsea, who were believed to have first option to sign him, in the past 18 months but is understood to have set his heart on a move to Anfield.

Belgium’s elimination from the World Cup has cleared the way for Liverpool to open talks with Origi, having agreed a fee for the teenager before the tournament began.

Origi’s eyecatching form in Brazil prompted interest from several clubs but Liverpool had already stolen a march on their rival suitors by striking a deal with Lille which would see the 19-year-old spend next season on loan at the French club.

The fee for Origi could eventually rise to £9.8 million but Liverpool regard believe that is a price worth paying for a player who is viewed as having more potential than Christian Benteke and Romelu Lukaku within the Belgian camp.

Despite speculation that Suárez’s move from Liverpool to Barcelona is close to being finalised, negotiations are yet to be concluded as the two clubs endeavour to reach an agreement on payment structure and await a definitive response from Sánchez about his future.

As reported in The Times on Thursday, Barcelona have told Liverpool that they are willing to trigger Suárez’s exit clause, a figure that Anfield sources claim is about of £80 million, but those at the Nou Camp maintain that it is closer to £63 million.

That aspect of the deal is likely to prove a formality given Barcelona’s determination to sign the Uruguay forward with a greater complicating factor being Sánchez’s desire, or lack of it, to act as a makeweight in the transfer.

Liverpool want the Chile international to replace Suárez and have not given up hope of signing him despite growing speculation that he would prefer to join either Arsenal or Juventus. Anfield officials are currently in discussions with Sánchez’s representatives but they will accept a straight cash deal for Suárez from Barcelona in the event of the winger resisting their overtures.

In contrast to Sánchez, Dejan Lovren could not have made his intentions more clear in an interview with Sportske Novosti, the Croatian newspaper, in which he criticised Southampton for not accepting the Merseyside club’s £20 million offer to sign him and admitted “my head is already at Liverpool”.

“Liverpool sent the offer and the club haven’t informed me,” the defender said. “Not even about the subsequent Liverpool bids. That wasn’t right. I found out about the bid from other people which disappointed me and I realised I’ve got no business staying at Southampton.

“Liverpool sent a £20 million offer and they [Southampton] paid £9 million for me, so they would’ve earned twice the amount. At this point, I don’t know what I’ll do and I don’t like it. It was unbelievable that a few days ago I had an offer of £20 million pounds. It was in the morning and by the afternoon the club had said I was not for sale. Frankly, my head is already at Liverpool.”

true,the_oncoming_storm,cnty-scotland,The Glorious Kingdom of Fife,"&gt; With regard to research funding, Scotland currently gets 13% of research council funding despite not contributing this much to general taxation that pays for it. After independence the UK government will not agree to pay more out than Scotland pays into a common research council because that would be political suicide. To maintain the current spending in Scotland the government would have to spend a greater proportion of tax money on it.

All true, but the disparity is in the region of 4% (at the moment). It's not beyond the realms of possibility that an approach to addressing this can be negotiated while retaining the UK research framework, bearing in mind that the funding allocation is determined by who has the good ideas, not geography. 

That said, I don't think money is a big issue here, it's the retention of pan-UK projects and collaboration that's in everybody's interests. It's eminently possible to achieve this after independence as the existence of EU projects demonstrates.

&gt; On top of this, all the Scottish universities will lose the fees they get from non-Scottish UK students (I know it has been said that they could still charge them but assuming Scotland remains in the EU it just won't be possible, it would take 1 court case to overturn). 

I'm sure there'll be a legal work around based on needing a number of years' higher education in Scotland to qualify, or offering fee-covering-grants based on certain conditions.


I agree this aspect is ill thought out, but, as you said, it's just the SNPs wish list and they'll need to put it to the electorate in 2016. There's no guarantee they'd form the first government.

Then again all I have seen from him is the WC, I have no prior knowledge of him. 

Markovic could be good, but he is still unproven, And until you see him in a Liverpool shirt we just wont know. 

And Shaqiri's hat-tick we must remember came against a physical but not tactically astute Honduran defence, It was also only really that game he was able to shine at all, but then like you say, regular performances could well bring out consistent performances of that quality.

&gt;

&gt;__British Israelism__ (also called __Anglo-Israelism__) is a doctrine based on the hypothesis that people of [Western European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe) descent, particularly those in Great Britain, are the direct lineal descendants of the [Ten Lost Tribes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Lost_Tribes) of Israel. The doctrine often includes the tenet that the [British Royal Family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Royal_Family) is directly descended from the line of [King David](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_David).

&gt;The central tenets of British Israelism have been refuted by evidence from modern [genetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics), [linguistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics), [archaeological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeological) and [philological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philological) research. The doctrine continues, however, to have a significant number of adherents.

&gt;The movement has never had a head organisation or a centralized structure. Various British Israelite organisations were set up across the [British Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire) and in [America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) from the 1870s; a small number of such organisations are still active today.

According to the doctrine, the Lost Ten tribes of Israel found their way to Western Europe and Britain, becoming ancestors of the British and related peoples.*

true,Orsenfelt,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"Maybe you are too young to remember the ban on British beef exports in 1996 after BSE. 

In '96 we found out that BSE in cattle was linked to CJD in humans, our cattle had a 20% higher instance rate than anyone else and the EU banned all imports of British beef to EU member states. At the time this was worth ~£670m/year to our economy, nearly £1bn in today's money. Wiped off the books in one go.

In '99 John Major tried to get it lifted by starting the 'beef war', mostly by wildly vetoing anything proposed at the time (Creation of Europol is one I remember that the Germans wanted). The EU decided to lift *some* restrictions but Germany and France both refused to comply. We sued France, they lost and the EU forced them to adopt the new eased rules. 

If we weren't a member state we wouldn't have been able to cause the disruption, wouldn't have been able to sue France in the way we did and wouldn't have had the EU force them to start buying our beef again.

The ban wasn't completely lifted until 2006. 

Now, I know what you're going to say. *""So much for the ability to stop negative effects""*. You wouldn't be wrong, there's still card games to be played within the EU like what treaties we sign and what courts we allow to make decisions *but* the ban would have still happened. France + Germany + etc would have still stopped buying our beef even if the EU didn't exist. The key point is that they would have *continued* not buying our beef had the EU never existed.. but it did and we made it force them to play with our meatball.",0,1404684535,null,0,false,0,ciq535d,t3_29yg0n,t1_ciq535d,t1_ciq3pil,null,1435478593,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Lets not forget, neither of the trailers said what will happen exactly. They just gave a bit of an introduction to it.

Anyone can create a network with any address they like add a bit of static routing and change a network card to use the same address (or a virtual network and a virtual machine) and make requests appear as if they are from there, requests never go to the internet as the router looks down its routing table and are sent down a port on a router. They appear as if they are from a specific internet device when in fact the traffic never hit the internet. 

IP addresses are meaningless, easily spoofed and identifying anyone on the basis of an IP address is utter bollocks, proof of nothing, nothing at all. 

The reason for not identifying anyone redditor or otherwise is it carries legal implications and leads to witch hunts.
