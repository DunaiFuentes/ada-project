true,sirbruce,null,null,"The Doctor clearly states in ""An Unearthly Child"" that [""Susan and I are cut off from our own planet.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5v7ZmO5xPs) which is a clear indication he's not from Earth, although they also talk about being from the future as well.  One could speculate they could be future humans from a planet colonized by Earth, but this somewhat begs the question how far into the future are humans no longer human?

As far as biological differences, the Doctor is not established as having two hearts until ""Spearhead from Space"", and we met the Time Lords in ""The War Games"".  However, I believe it was The Monk in ""The Time Meddler"" that first suggested on-screen that he and The Doctor were aliens (although ""Gallifrey"" is not mentioned by named until the Third Doctor).  Certainly his first regeneration in ""The Tenth Planet"" implies he's not human, and it's flat-out stated in ""The Evil of the Daleks"" that the Doctor isn't human, since the Dalek's arch doesn't affect him because he's not human.

Now, theoretically, one could write a story that a future Earth is actually sent back in time to become Gallifrey (the moving, and even renaming, of Earth has been the subject of several Doctor Who episodes), but even this would be being too clever by half.

By ""being human"" we mean ""humans as we'd recognize and know them"", and I think ""The Time Meddler"" is where that becomes clear.

true,wherearemyfeet,null,null,"&gt; Formally, the Crown is a synonym for the British state.

Right, but I'm referring to the Crown Estate, not the ""Crown"" as a legal term. The Estate belongs to the Monarch, but it is not her personal property.

&gt;I acknowledged no such thing.

The Queen has no official power. Therefore removing her will bring no *real* benefit except to stoke the egos of a few Republicans.

&gt;That's cynical and unfair. 

It's not incorrect though.

&gt;Equality and accountability are not ""feel-good"" factors; they are central to fair and open societies.

But since the Queen has no real powers, removing her doesn't make anyone's lives better, stronger or more equal to their neighbour. It would bring no real benefit to anybody, apart from a feel-good factor. 

&gt;I think that choosing symbols matters, and symbols of openness, fairness and accountability are better than symbols of hereditary privilege.

Symbols don't bring any real benefit to somebody's life. They're token gestures. Now if the Queen was the overall ruler and made the laws, I'd be with you on this. But she's not. So I'm not.

&gt;In parliamentary republics such as Ireland, Presidents such as Mary Robinson and Mary McAleese have often been quite influential and widely-respected, rising above party politics and ""setting the tone"" for the nation.

But to what extent is entirely debatable. ""Setting the tone for the nation"" doesn't feed the hungry, clothe the naked or accommodate the homeless. It's a symbolic yet empty gesture. 

&gt;Remember the importance of symbols.

I remember they don't actually do anything real.

&gt;Given that our current Prime Minister is a distant relative of the Royals (he's descended from William IV) it seems that the old network of privilege is alive and well.

This is meaningless. My next-door neighbour is descended from the Royals (yes, I'm being serious). He's not wealthy, he's not part of the ""old network of privilege"".

The Irish system isn't the same as the UK one. The applications system is different for a start and the fees are very different.

If the latter, does your American university not have links with universities in the UK or Ireland? It's usually the case that where you go in the USA guides you towards where you go for the year abroad. For example some of MIT's year abroad partners in Europe are Cambridge, Oxford and Sciences Po, while the University of Washington (good old UDub) does exchanges with UCL, Bristol, Sussex and Edinburgh. You often need to have done two years at your US university before you can do a year in the UK. My own university has this as a requirement for people doing study abroad.

I have much more faith in an attack with Sanchez, Sturridge, Lallana, Sterling, hopefully a new fullback or two, and Ricky Lambert as a backup plan than I do with Suarez.  Suarez has been the best player on our team for some years now and we've gotten used to the idea of having him in our squad but lets remember his weaknesses.  I remember being extremely frustrated on multiple occasions in games where Suarez tries to dribble through opponents way too much.  Also, he's fast but not as fast as Sterling, Sturridge, or even Sanchez.  He also has a wildcard factor of being capable of doing anything wrong on the pitch at a given moment so that's a liability we could do without.

I mainly want to see anything sciencey made gender neutral, but I don't see a problem with going the whole hog.

The make a crass comparison to the UK, it would be like having different, unrelated Parliaments for people earning over £50k a year, and people earning under £50k a year. 

In the EU, for it to work effectively, there either needs to be more integration and federalisation, so the EU can work as a whole to deal with issues, rather than each country looking out only for themselves, or there needs to be less integration and federalisation, so you don't get the issues like the one I mentioned with immigration.

&gt; The European Parliament ... shall elect the President of the Commission.

I'm not sure how that can be read in any way other than stating that the President is elected by the Parliament.

The relevant part about the European Council is in Article 17(7):

&gt; Taking into account the elections to the European Parliament and after having held the appropriate consultations, the European Council, acting by a qualified majority, shall propose to the European Parliament a candidate for President of the Commission. This candidate shall be elected by the European Parliament by a majority of its component members.

The European Council *proposes* candidates, the Parliament *elects* the President. That is what the Treaty says.

The European Council has voted to propose Juncker, the person put forward by the Parliamentary group with the most seats in the Parliament, who they expect (based on appropriate consultations) will be able to secure the necessary votes to be elected.

I doubt they have ignored the surge in anti-EU feeling, but I also imagine they took account of which parties got the most seats; predominantly pro-EU or unionist parties. There can be only one President of the Commission, so the majority gets its way. But the minorities will still have their voice in the Parliament and, likely, in the Council of the EU.

The major Parliamentary Groups did take an interesting step in declaring amongst themselves how they interpreted Article 17(7), and they have annoyed many of those on the European Council by doing so, but given that the Treaty specifically says (twice) that the Parliament, not the European Council, elects the President, they may be justified in doing so.

Your also completely wrong to say he's the only one to crack under pressure, completely wrong. Even in the context of this World Cup you're wrong.

The full quote:

&gt;Taking into account the elections to the European Parliament and after having held the appropriate consultations, the European Council, acting by a qualified majority, shall propose to the European Parliament a candidate for President of the Commission. This candidate shall be elected by the European Parliament by a majority of its component members. If he does not obtain the required majority, the European Council, acting by a qualified majority, shall within one month propose a new candidate who shall be elected by the European Parliament following the same procedure.

&gt;The Council, by common accord with the President-elect, shall adopt the list of the other persons whom it proposes for appointment as members of the Commission. They shall be selected, on the basis of the suggestions made by Member States, in accordance with the criteria set out in paragraph 3, second subparagraph, and paragraph 5, second subparagraph.

Why are you fighting this so hard? The president is chosen by the council, the council is not the European Parliament. Whether the treaty mentions elected is irrelevant. It also mentions candidate many times.

I agree we can't blame a person for their background, but **all** parties need to do something about the increasing homogenisation of Westminster. 

Public school, decent university, okay-paying job in politics, MP. It's going to frame a certain world view. I can make anyone understand on an intellectual level what it is to be scraping by... but you're never going to know how much energy, and thought, and stress is dedicated to money when you're never *quite* sure there's enough to cover all the bills, and just how big a deal it can be when those bills rise even a little, or there's an unexpected expense. That is a life experience that is simply missing from an increasing number of our MPs lives. 

So while I'll never blame an individual for their upbringing, I would like people in power to be a little more aware. 

Of course nothing is that simple, and at any ministerial position you're going to be dealing with some massively complex problems, so you are going to need someone intellectually capable of dealing with them... and public school &gt; Oxbridge does prepare one rather better for that than driving a fork-lift for Land Rover.

By virtue of being the Monarch, yes. But as soon as she loses that position, for instance by abdication, she ceases to have any claim to it.

&gt;The Queen has no official power.

You mean she has no de facto power, because she outsources it to people who are actually elected. On paper she's the most powerful monarch in the world. She also has a lot of ""soft power"", such as private meetings with politicians, for which she is not accountable.

&gt;Therefore removing her will bring no real benefit except to stoke the egos of a few Republicans.

I love how you're framing this as selfishness on the part of people who believe in elections. The selfishness is to deny the right of people who want to choose their head of state, because you yourself do not. If you don't believe in an elected head of state, you wouldn't need to vote for one.

&gt;Symbols don't bring any real benefit to somebody's life. They're token gestures.

You keep dismissing the importance of symbols, with which I don't agree. We have a state church in a mostly-secular country, with 26 bishops in the House of Lords. The monarch is not neutral in matters of religion, as would be appropriate for 21st century Britain; she's the leader of the Church of England. That's also a form of privilege, and it's completely undemocratic.

&gt;""Setting the tone for the nation"" doesn't feed the hungry, clothe the naked or accommodate the homeless. It's a symbolic yet empty gesture. 

As is a monarch. A very expensive empty gesture at that. Also, most things that Parliament does accomplish none of those goals. Does that justify firing the lot of them?

&gt;I remember they don't actually do anything real.

So paint a Swaskita on a synagogue and see what kind of reception you get. Be sure to point out to people that symbols aren't real.

This is true, and it isn't at the same time.

It's true that officially, it doesn't celebrate protestant supremacy. This is in part due to the Orange Order and DUP and the like realising that they can't go on paying thousands for celebrations that are seen as oppressive to many of the population; hence the whole rebranding of the 12th as a 'family friendly, inclusive event'.

It's untrue, in that many many of the Orange Order marches still carry banners with UVF affiliated men on them. UVF, LVF et cetera. (In before the 'Old UVF were legitimate' excuse. One oppressive paramilitary or civil group is as bad as the next, no matter how old they are). There's also many many known instances of Orange Order men shouting slogans such as 'Second class citizens! This is our country!' at people watching them in contentious areas.

As a pro-reunification citizen of Northern Ireland; if you want the 12th to be truely inclusive then you must do three things.

* End your obsession and insisting on marching through contentious areas.

* Stop flying banners that are deemed offensive at best. Many of the men on those banners murdered friends/family of the people you're marching past in contentious areas.

* Stop aggressive behaviour toward people you *think* are catholic - it's Neanderthal behaviour.

TL;DR - The biggest problem with the 12th is the actions of the Orange Order, or the people participating in the marches.",0,1403905513,null,0,1403905723,0,ciiugro,t3_299sov,t1_ciiugro,t3_299sov,null,1434435095,10,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,10

Many footballers come from very underprivileged backgrounds, but none act like Suarez do. It certainly doesn't ""educate people about his background"" - all I learned was that he was poor, didn't like moving house, his girlfriend moved to Europe, and he worked hard at football. 

No it isn't. you lose your cool when people piss you off. I have never been under pressure playing football (apart from one penalty shootout in an amateur cup final), but I have lost my cool before when I get fouled or when a player elbows me in the box or whatever. It is nothing to do with pressure, but frustration. I am guessing that you have not played much football (this is not an attack on you - not playing is perfectly fine), else I believe that you would understand that Suarez's act was giving into frustration, not pressure. A lot of what players do when they elbow, headbut, etc. is trying to frustrate (to goad them into a foul) and intimidate other players. That is a case of ""doing what it takes to win"", not ""cracking under pressure"".

Suarez didn't crack under pressure, he lost his cool and attacked another player. that's the only way you can look at it. 

""just because a bite isn't the 'norm' thing to do for a grown man doesn't make it worse than and elbow, heabutt etc. I personally would much rather be bitten like Cheilini was than have my nose broken by a header.""

Totally irrelevant. 

The bite is worse because it is unprovoked, animalistic, repeated, demeaning, and uncomfortable to see. sure it doesn't do as much physical damage, but that doesn't matter. Imagine for the sake of argument that Suarez had crapped in his hand and thrown it at opposition players. That isn't the ""norm"" thing to do. I would rather have poo on me than have my nose broken by a header or being bitten on the shoulder, but that doesn't mean that it does not warrant a massive ban!

Protestants in this context may well say that they feel that their culture is being chipped away, please try to understand that the whole premise of the Twelfth and associated practices venerate repeated attempts to suppress or even annihilate irish culture and catholicism.

I would have very little issue with parades if they were conducted peacefully and without malice.

true,DukePPUk,null,null,"Ok, perhaps I need to go back to more basic EU principles.

The European Council is made up of the relevant Heads of State or Government of the Member States. They have a limited role in the day-to-day operations of the EU, their job is (as noted above) to put forward candidates for various positions (such as the President of the Commission) and set out the general policy direction of the EU. The European Council acts as a sort of Head of State of the EU.

The President of the Commission runs the Commission, which is the Government of the EU. The President is the Head of Government (equivalent to the UK Prime Minister) and he or she is responsible for the day-to-day running of the EU, along with their ""cabinet"" of Commissioners. In previous Commissions (up to and including the current one, iirc, but not the next one), there was one Commissioner for each Member State, but they represented the EU, not their Member State. I'm not entirely sure how they were selected pre-Libson, but they were answerable to the Parliament.

The Council (which isn't the same thing as the European Council), sometimes called the Council of the EU or Council of Ministers is made up of one delegate from each Member State, and represents the Member States. It has some legislative functions (along with the Parliament) and some executive ones (along with the Commission).

Candidates for the President of the Commission are *proposed* by the European Council. The Parliament then holds a vote to decide whether or not to elect the candidate. If not, the European Council has to come back with a better option. The Treaties are quite clear in their wording that it is the Parliament which elects the President.

Once a President is elected, the Council (not the European Council) works with the President-elect to come up with a proposed cabinet of other Commissioners (based on various requirements). With the consent of the Parliament, these go before the European Council who gets to appoint them.

So the President is elected by the Parliament, from candidates proposed by the European Council. The other Commissioners are collectively appointed by the European Council, with the consent of the Parliament, on the basis of proposals from the Council.

The Council gets no say in choosing the President.

true,ChunkyCodLoins,,Elsie Mo,"Ok, so this kind of depends on what you consider 'better', but as a drinker of real ale (which in itself is a bit of a misnomer) beer can be conditioned in a bottle, whereas crappy mass-produced beer is spunked into a can at the end of the manufacturing process. 
If you've ever made home brew then the stage following fermentation (yeast feeds off sugar and creates alcohol) is to pop that bad boy in a pressure-sealed container for it to prove (kind of a maturation process). You can do this in any air-tight container that's strong enough to withstand the pressure of the CO2 created (be it a pressure barrel or thick glass bottle). Cans can't withstand that pressure, so canned beers are packaged in their completed, manufactured, soulless state. 
In general, bottled lagers are no better than canned (this isn't always the case) but 'real' beer that is bottle conditioned means opening that bottle is like opening a tiny barrel of your own beer, instead of some beer-like stuff that's been packaged at the end.

Well yeah, but in his last 2 seasons with Nordsjaelland he featured prominently as they won the title and finished 2nd, and won the domestic cup, so it's not as if his good performances were exclusive to a few Champions League games.

Id guess a land registry search and title plan (£6) plus enquiries with the local authority will tell you a great deal. English Heritage also maintain the listed building register which will almost definitely have a similar building with a similar feature (unless something unique happened here).
  
My only observation is that the blue garage and window appear to be later additions or repairs due to the lintel above both...the left hand door has a brick built lintel and appears to be part of an original entrance which was possibly widened at one time. Some horse drawn carriages were smaller than modern cars. There is a great collection of carriages on Luton, Bedfordshire called the Mossman collection. Worth a visit if anyones interested.
  
And to add my 2p to the 'agents are bastards' bit - yeah most of them are to be honest? BUT we only charge what the market will pay, and what the landlord wants - but even that is dictated by the price of other property in the area....and THAT is dictated by the tenant who decides it's a good deal. If nobody will take it, the price comes down and more to the point the price is ALWAYS negotiable, and so are the fees. So, please, don't blame the agent. Blame the pratt that moved in next door and didnt negotiate the price, cos he just single handedly justified a rent increase for the entire street....what a chump. 
  
Always negotiate. Hard.
  
Some other lovely truths; a reference costs an agent no more than £30 - the rest is profit. Admin fees are kinda about right but still could be done for less with a little systems automation. Fees for renewals and other bits are bollocks and not worth agreeing to. Agents generally spend 80% of their time dealing with 20% of their portfolio....and the 80% landlords are paying a monthly fee to cover that work. Negotiators get paid peanuts, which is why they're all monkeys. Ask for a Director or a Manager...the non-twattish ones have been in the game a long time and will help you out.....like me!

But it's a helluva long way from Bristol - I know, I was living there when I did my first tour of the Highlands.

These are in no particular order, but all in the Highlands and west of the Great Glen :-

* Durness and ~~Snoo~~ Smoo's Cave.
* Cape Wrath if you can get to it. Not been myself but I'd be surprised if it was less than toadly ossum dood.
* Oban town, and perhaps a trip from there to Mull and Tobermory.
* Applecross Pass - go on a clear day and be prepared to be staggered by the views. Leave from Strathcarron (after a cheeky pint at the hotel), do the magnificent drive up to the pass, and if you can be bothered take a hike out to the head of Sgurr A'Charocain, it's fucking awesome beyond belief. From there you can motor down to Applecross village and then take a leisurely drive on the coast road to Shieldaig. Camp in the spartan but lovely campsite ... if it's still there.
* The road down to Glenelg and the old Kylerhea ferry to Skye.
* Skye! It's almost entirely awesome.
* Arisaig and The Sands Of Morar.
* The Kyle of Tongue.
* Spean Bridge, the Commando memorial, and the forest a little to the west that I forget the name of.
* If you like looking at mountains then you're in luck - Arkle, Foinaven, Suilven, and Quinag are some of my faves - but the place is stuffed with them, take yer pick.
* Go panning for gold in the hills around Helmsdale.
* The Bonnie Prince Charlie memorial at Glenfinnan at the head of Loch Shiel, and the railway viaduct behind it.
* Easter Ross, the Inverness area, the Black Isle, and the seaside villages on the East coast north of the Murray Firth.
* The road through Altnaharra - you will feel 1,000,000 miles from the urban grime of Brizzle.
* Almost forgot : If you like stone circles like everyone else seems to think, then Calanais on the Isle of Lewis is gonna push *all* the buttons. Not been myself .. but I'd like to!
* Personal favourite places of mine include Glenuig and especially Smirisary Sands; Plockton; Eigg; Kylesku - I got my username there!; yadda yadda yadda.

No links 'cos I'm a lazy bum and JFGI.

These are all places informed by personal experience, but my main impression of the Highlands is that it is BIG and EMPTY, and almost always gob-smackingly gorgeous. Highland Scotland is magnificent if you like your own company and your senses stimulated.

Turns out though when it came to providing evidence for their claims, they couldn't because this was just a hypothesis, and not only that....evidence carried out by actual scientists (one guy was Sacha Baron Cohen's cousin) showed male and females actually naturally gravitated towards things through instinct led by hormones and their hypothesis was false....but they insisted on ignoring any biological evidence and continued to provide nothing to support their theories.  

Anyway the whole documentary series showed feminism for the sham it is and the government was forced under pressure from the public to stop funding various feminist groups for talking bollocks because they were making shit up and presenting it as fact and the state was basing policies on it.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; There is no such thing as a bad EU law

Oh yes there fucking is. Lets start with my former career HGV driving. We used to use these things called domestic rules. This limited the working day to 11 hours meaning you got 13 hours a day break. Then along came the EU drivers hours rules which all HGV drivers barring a few doing limited types of work had to follow. The maximum working day increased to 13hrs which could be extended to 15 hours three times a week with a maximum working week of 84hrs. So instead of the driver of a 44 tonne lorry getting 13hrs a day off, thanks to EU law they get 11hrs which can be reduced to 9hrs three times a week. 

That's 9hrs to drive from work to home, get a meal, a bath/shower, 8hrs sleep, get up, have breakfast, get ready for work and drive to work. Doesn't fit into 9hrs does it? Guess what takes the hit - rest. The thing you want the driver of a 44 tonne lorry not to be shortcutting.

It gets even worse. If double manning, two lorry drivers in one vehicle, the legal duty you can do is 21hrs out of every 30. That means you can start work at 6am on Monday morning and legally work right through to 3am Tuesday morning (although each driver can only drive 9/10hrs in that time.) You are then only required to take a 9hr break before doing another 21hr shift and you can do that for 6 days.

So yes there are such things as bad EU laws.

Edit: Thought of another one. Tuberculosis in cattle. There's absolutely no need for it as there's a vaccination. However vaccination of cattle against TB is currently prohibited by EU legislation, in place principally because BCG vaccination of cattle can interfere with the tuberculin skin test - a vaccinated cow could show as positive. Vaccinating cattle in the UK against TB but without a Marketing Authorisation for the vaccine runs the risk that live cattle and cattle product exports could be banned by other countries.",0,1403909069,null,0,1403909905,0,ciivzay,t3_2990iq,t1_ciivzay,t1_ciilw9o,null,1434435925,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

Yes, he scored some goals that won us points that season, but his performances were, with only a couple of exceptions I can recall, incredibly underwhelming. Clint was OK, nothing more, he didn't perform his best here, but he also wasn't played in his best position. He wasn't a terrible transfer, just one that didn't really work out, and he moved on after one season. To any non-american spurs fan he was just a rotation player who played briefly for us, they happen quite a lot in football and are largely forgotten.

I get why Americans fans here love Clint, he was a great player at Fulham, is one of the best current American players, and for many people probably influenced their supporting Spurs. But the attention he gets on here considering his actual role for Spurs can become quite tiresome, its not like we (or I at least) hate him, we're just indifferent towards him and find the amount of discussion about him irritating. 

So I guess in a way it is kind of because he's american, but its more because the attention he gets is entirely because he's american. His actual time here did absolutely nothing to justify the love he gets on this sub, and so people tired of it tend to react, creating the massive split opinion that exists here. I know I found the ""Yes Clint scoring after x seconds"" or whatever it was post here after your first match quite annoying, because there was already a post for world cup discussion, and really its celebrating an American success, not a Spurs one, so why is it here.",0,1403909984,null,0,1403910582,0,ciiwcj6,t3_299gjn,t1_ciiwcj6,t1_ciit298,null,1434436171,12,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,12

Diplomatically we've lost in the short term. But I'm not convinced that we lost a great deal (or that we had a great deal to lose). I can't help thinking that there's more to this than is immediately obvious. 

I'm sure everything you've said was said to Cameron a hundred times, but whilst I disagree with the man on many issues, I don't view him as being stupid. There's more to his behaviour than is completely obvious, and it's possible to imagine several scenarios where a short term loss could end up being a long term gain.

Edit: I think the important thing here is that EU decision making a sort of hybrid area. It's partly a matter of diplomacy, but also a matter of governance. What Cameron did is quite unusual in one sphere (diplomacy), but pretty commonplace in the other (governance). It's interesting that most of his opponents want to push for integration, which would make the EU more about governance, whilst simultaneously calling him out for his behaviour in the diplomatic sphere.

&gt; First off let me say that the twelfth no longer celebrates Protestant supremacy or anything of the sort.

What about all those Orange Order banners which do? 

&gt; How many people go out on St. Patrick's day to celebrate the saint of Ireland.

St. Patrick is a saint in Catholicism and most Protestant sects, and is celebrated by most Christian denominations. He's not a Catholic or a nationalist symbol, but a symbol for all Christians living on the island of Ireland. Celebrating St. Patrick's Day isn't anything like celebrating the slaughter of Catholics by Protestants in some 17th century battle. St. Patrick's Day is about celebrating an individual who's regarded as bringing Christianity to the island of Ireland and who did so in a peaceful manner. If anything, St. Patrick ought to be regarded as a unifying symbol for both Protestants and Catholics, not a divisive symbol like The Twelfth. 

&gt; Some of us just see it as a breach of our tradition. It feels like slowly but surely our culture is being chipped away at.

No, Orange Order marchers go around with their sectarian banners into nationalist areas asserting their sense of entitlement, which causes unrest and does anything but encourage community cohesion. No-one cares if it's a tradition or not, it's there for no reason other than to stir trouble. Some traditions are not good and should not be encouraged. Catholics and nationalists do not such thing on St. Patrick's Day and neither do they burn the Union Jack.

true,bad__reddit,null,null,"&gt; How many prosecutions for it have there been since the law was passed? How many children has it happened to since the law was passed? It is the responsibility of the equalities minister to address this.

Not many, but the current government have been the first to successfully prosecute people under the new law. So if anything the Equalities Minister is doing what you want them to do. 

&gt;This isn't preventing someone from travelling abroad for thought crime, this is preventing someone from being trafficked to be a deliberate victim of crime. Yes there are sensitivities about the fact that this affects certain groups and not others but again it's the job of the equalities minister to overcome these sensitivities in a fair and respectful way.

I'm not sure you understand. How are we going to identify people that are at risk of this crime? It's not as if the victims of this crime are already in contact with social workers before it happens. How are we going to anticipate who we should focus this attention on?

&gt;You'd be surprised at the difference a bit of risk awareness training can make. Many public servants don't know what to look for in at risk communities, know what to do if they feel there is a risk or feel confident of taking action even if they do see a risk.


I assure you that social workers are fully aware of the issues that the communities that they serve face. Michael Gove has personally written to every school in the country, apparently. I'm not really sure what you think the government should be doing here that isn't already being done.

&gt;No, but certainly they should concentrate on this and other more serious issues before making a fool of themselves by trying to dictate to private businesses how they market their products.

Is it particularly bad that the Equalities Minister is targeting a business for criticism? Should the Equalities Minister focus solely on other government entities?  Or is it alright for the Equalities Minister to criticise private individuals as long as these private individuals are not conducting business?",0,1403912429,null,0,false,0,ciixbt1,t3_298xvn,t1_ciixbt1,t1_ciiq3ye,null,1434436635,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,Clbull,null,null,"I graduated with BA (Hons) History last year. I am merely reiterating the requirements of said graduate schemes which are usually ""any 2:1 or above degree"", ""280 to 320 or above UCAS points"" and ""B in English Language and Mathematics at GCSE."" The reason I wanted to do accounting was that I did a module for it in my second year. Despite getting 37% in said module because I got screwed around by bad circumstances on both exams and coursework, my intention was to continue it and actually repeat all of the things I did badly in by sitting the relevant exams rather than expecting exemptions.

Feeling like I didn't try hard enough in my A Levels 4 to 6 years ago because I didn't get 320 UCAS Points put me down so considerably to the point where I began having anxiety triggered by a panic attack and depression issues over the last nine months and have been seeing two counsellors on and off since then.

I applied for dozens of accounts assistant, bookkeeper and purchase ledger clerk roles because I wanted more experience in the financial sector and to eventually raise some money for both my own needs and to study AAT and only got one response for an interview all the way back in late July last year; an interview for a minimum wage junior accounts assistant role at a small firm which I subsequently bombed because I didn't explain the challenges I faced with my degree hard enough and I came across as a bit shy and awkward. Apart from a 50 minute phone interview with Imperial Tobacco for a HR role back in January which I failed miserably? That's all the responses I actually got.

Two months ago, I signed on for Jobseekers Allowance. The people over at JobCentrePlus don't help you find work at all. Instead, they coach you by telling you to check for jobs every day, register with as many recruitment agencies as you can and apply for any job with up to a 90 minute commute distance regularly. If you slack off, there goes your JSA for anywhere between 4 weeks and 3 years (Yes, sanctions CAN get that severe, there are some JSA horror stories which prove this.)

Back to your point, I suppose you aren't entirely fucked. I dunno if accounting counts as a STEM subject but a mathematical degree could be useful in a programming role if you ever wanted to learn how to code. Studying accounting for 3 years as a degree looks a helluva lot better than studying history as well, because an accounting degree teaches more useful skills in the work force than critically analyzing say... certain periods of time irrelevant to the modern day.

I suppose with an accounting degree if you really wanted to stick with it as a career, you could talk your way into an accounts assistant role or if you do the first year of ACCA or AAT exams (and your accounting degree could make you exempt from a lot of exams), you could blag your way into a part-qualified accountant role at a smaller company.

The problem with ACCA or AAT exams is that you aren't considered fully qualified and don't receive the benefits of being a chartered accountant until you have achieved 2 years (or 3 on ACCA) job experience in an accounting role, so those exams won't mean a lot at least to the body themselves.

However, bear in mind that the recruitment process for a lot of these jobs are handled by recruitment agencies (and not the good kind either.)",0,1403914364,null,0,1403915532,0,ciiy384,t3_29544d,t1_ciiy384,t1_ciixowu,null,1435487929,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

In all fairness, under a proper system he would have been formally put forward and forced to campaign in the UK and in all likelihood would have won across Europe regardless as very few regular people like us actually give a shit. What happened instead was he got put forward in a backroom deal by the EPP and then secured himself a leading position in the EU without ever setting foot in the UK to campaign... That attitude in an of itself tells you a lot about the sort of EU this guy believes in... one where an entire nation of 60 million people can be totally marginalized because the governments of the other 380 million felt differently. 

I'm not a big fan of Cameron. He's a vaguely irritating PR-frontman chosen because he was the least-objectionable of a number of generally dis-likable candidates...**However**, I'm not sure we've heard the last of this. One thing Cameron isn't is stupid, and if he is making threats it probably because he's posturing himself as part of some bigger EU-plan. I wouldn't be surprised if there was some diplomatic retribution particularly against the Merkel administration in the next few months. In many ways, Cameron and Merkel need each others support in the EU, because both are trying to reform it which is ultimately going to mean passing new legislation - which will be hard to do without the ascent of the other. Cameron was in a tough spot on this one because the decision came down to a qualified-majority strawpoll... but there are other key EU policy areas where he **can** play diplomatic hardball by simply vetoing new legislation and one of those areas is finance which is especially relevant to the Germans.

If Merkel is smart, she'll write an article in a UK paper within the next month explaining the importance of anglo-deutsch leadership in the EU, her own willingness for reform and the fact she values the UKs membership of the EU more than endless federalization. More immediately the UK will get some serious concession prize like a major job-role on the European commission for the UK's EU commissioner (who I think might be Cameron's vaguely euroskeptic friend Andrew Lansley).

We've pretty much gone off of Shaqiri by buying Lallana, and now bringing in Markovic. And I think Sanchez is only being brought in because Suarez is leaving, can't see us spending 70m pounds (25m Lallana, 25m Markovic, 10m Can, 6m Origi, 4m Lambert) on signings already and then spending 30-40m on anyone but a replacement. 

Also I don't know if we need an imposing/dominating centre midfielder, as it wouldn't suit our defensive play style. We need high energy midfielders to cover for Hendo/Lallana/Allen/Can. Also I think if we were going to sign a replacement for Stevie in that role then we'd focus primarily on a ball playing defensive midfielder.

Having said that - I think that it's a good thing that toy companies are being pressured to make the science kits gender neutral.  I have no idea if it's going to actually change anything but it just seems like the right thing to do.  

But still - I'm skeptical that the discrepancies we see in fields like maths and engineering are mostly because of social conditioning.  Yes, there's still some sexism, but it seems more likely to me that most of the differences we currently see are due to innate differences in preferences between the sexes.

I say that, not because I'm a bigot, but because this is what the science I've read about seems to show.  For instance, see [this fascinating debate on gender.](http://edge.org/3rd_culture/debate05/debate05_index.html)

Edit:  [I also found this BBC news article](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-25857895) which discusses the question of whether toys influence later carer choices.  The article quotes a few researchers who think it might (and some who don't) but the evidence in favor is currently quite weak I think.

I try not to be an ideologue about these things.  If later research comes up with more compelling evidence then I hope I'd be happy to switch my view.

true,QWERTYwarrior12,lfc68,,"*My Thoughts*

We all know that with added CL football there's a lot more openings for gametime but whether there will be enough room for everyone is yet to be seen. 

- I feel like the CB department is stacked and could cause tensions if Lovren is added to it. Skrtel has shown that he is willing to stay and fight for his position once but will he feel rewarded having to do it again after imo, a good season bar 2 or 3 individual errors. Still think Lovren should come in and Toure should depart but it will make it much more difficult for the trio of Ilori(21), Wisdom(21) and Kelly(24) to make first team. The latter 2 are also capable of playing RB but are behind Johnson and Flanagan. Also the return of McLaughlin increases RB competition.

- Our attacking targets, while welcome, spell danger for some of our younger prospects. Shaqiri, 22, and Markovic, 20, are heavily rumoured targets which would threaten Sinclair(17), Ibe(18), Suso(20), Teixeira(21) and Borini(23). The younger players still have time to play and develop in the U21s but players such as Suso and Teixeira are reaching the age where they should start making appearances in the 1st team and Suso has already stated that he would be willing to search elsewhere for 1st team football, in the midst of rumours linking him with FC Porto. Not all academy players can 'do a Sterling' but I'm sure everyone had high hopes for Suso.",0,1403919882,null,0,false,0,cij06n2,t3_29agp5,t1_cij06n2,t3_29agp5,null,1434437893,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

He posted [another tardis with a photoshopped orange rotor as early as May](https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfa1/t31.0-8/10286951_787038517982043_881493556559313768_o.jpg). However, that particular picture is simply an orange photoshopped variant of [another artist's work](http://www.elysiun.com/forum/showthread.php?323541-TARDIS-Control-Room&amp;p=2651077&amp;viewfull=1#post2651077) (*not the same guy, but I'll keep both their facebooks to myself*).
 

So how did he know about ""season 8"" almost a month ago, or longer? Is he involved in production? He's fairly young and I only saw fan-related things on his page, most of his projects made for things like Gmod and Minecraft. No evidence of being a professional. Strange.

Your comment history suggests that you're from the US, so I presume it's the latter.  Either way, we all know that Americans don't have a monopoly on toughness or work ethic.  Is there a selection effect on US players who make it in Europe, skewing them towards these qualities? Maybe.  Players like Dempsey and McBride had these traits and succeeded in Europe, whereas someone like Donovan didn't, but I wouldn't read too much into this (and I surely don't want to make this another banal Donovan debate).

As for Dempsey specifically, it's pretty obvious you and I have very different views on him.  That's cool. I've been watching him since '06 when he came up with the Revs, and I disagree with almost everything you've said except the ""bursts of genius"" bit.  I think that's a perfect description, and it's the ""burst"" quality of his genius that is most frustrating to me.

I see no evidence whatsoever that foreign powers view us poorly for having them, again quite the opposite, what they may have done to rid themselves of a monarchy in the past has no relevance to these peaceful times and there's little doubt they are a source of fascination, envy and income.

Your friend makes a reasonable point, and indeed why stop with the monarchy? Why not give back our ill-gotten gains from centuries of war mongering and colonialism? Why not stop trying to shape the world in our image? The liberal in me can't think of a good reason. The realist says it's because democracy is an illusion and the only currencies the world values are strength and power.

&gt; And not just that sub. /r/Irishhistory is filled with anti-Brit sentiment

I wouldn't know. I'm not subscribed there. I'd imagine there would be a anti-British sentiment. The British did a lot of horrible things in Ireland. 

&gt; Inconceivable that there are Southern Irish posters there who are active here, given their obvious political views? Of course it's very possible.

Stop using the term 'Southern'. It's an archaic term. I'm from Donegal so I'm not from the south. The country lies to the west and north of NI. Malin Head is actually further north geographically than NI itself. Southern Ireland hasn't existed since the 1920's.

I never said there wasn't any /r/ireland users who post here that don't have republican political views. You made out it was the whole sub though. 

&gt; You're refusal to accept simple logical possibilities is what makes you immature. 

No, you're immature. You accusing me of saying things that I haven't and are being confrontational for no reason.

But that's not their primary goal. Their primary goal is subjugation of otherwise free people and their complete obedience to the power that wields the religion. Now, people also fear death and hellfire (due to indoctrination during childhood, or mental illness, or because it's ""healthier"" to pretend so under the regime they live in...).  
So they read their holy book and realise that there's a lot of disturbing things in it. More importantly, they realise that parts of the book are just plain wrong, be it because it contradicts science (e.g. the Earth is flat and in the center of the solar system, which is at the very least implied, if not explicitly stated in both, the Koran and the Bible), or their moral sense (e.g. mass murder is ok), or their personal experience (e.g. non-believers are stupid and your enemies and you cannot ever trust them and should never be friends with them).  
Now, in a normal case you'd read this and say, ""Oops, this is not for me."" But remember hellfire and eternal punishment, coupled with the promise of eternal life (which sounds good on paper, but after 500,000 years with your ""loved ones"" you'll change your mind for sure)?  
You never know if it maybe isn't true after all. So you start twisting and contriving why X really doesn't mean X but rather U. I mean just look at it! X really resembles a U much more than an X if you examine it carefully.  
But that's not how Religion works. It's all or nothing. You can't pick and choose. And if you do, you're headed for eternal damnation (or stoning/beheading/burning by extremists). ""REPENT! Repent, ere it's too  late, for the end is nigh!"", they will scream.  
Jokes aside, and going back to your point that they don't all accept this unquestioningly. Of course they don't. But they HAVE to. It's what God demands of them. If they don't, then they are sinners against God, and will suffer the consequences. Either in this life, at the hands of religious fanatics or a terror-state; or in the next life, at the hands of Dark Elves, with their aesthetically alluring cruelty and of seemingly friendly but sadistic gnomes that look like Hello Kitty (Why not?) and care much more about your squeals and wailing than aesthetics.

More in the 'looks like this may be the best for all parties involved' kind of way. If pressure really is the thing that breaks Luis, then playing for one of the Spanish giants he can just be a great player on a team of great players. He can still shine and show the world his talent, get endorsement deals and all the rest, but the main focus and pressure would always stay on Messi or CR7. He might not ever get a balon d'or, for example, but he also wouldn't be carrying all that pressure on him. Of course he has talented teammates here, but Luis is head and shoulders above the rest.  In Spain he'd be playing on a team full of players who have won at the highest levels for club and country repeatedly over the years. Maybe playing on a team full of calm, confident and focused heads will help Luis keep his. Right now the only one on the team that can give advice in those pressure packed situations is Stevie, and we're already past nine years since the miracle in Istanbul, and I suspect even Stevie himself lost focus at times over the past few months. Plus his wife's family is in Spain, and that's another source of support for him. 

We wouldn't just be throwing him out. We'd be receiving a fair valuation for him and sending him on to what appears to be his dream job. I don't doubt that Rodgers and Peters could do a good job with him, but if his whole life has been a struggle why keep fighting when a good solution has come along?

But I guess LFC fans would be left to wonder, but what about the club? how do we replace his goals? First, don't forget that we have a very very good Daniel Sturridge. I know people get frustrated with him at times but look how far he's come in the short time we had him. He had to grow from just hoping he would get the chance to be a starting premier league striker, to handling the physical and mental demands of being a week in, week out striker performing at a high level, to being a leader on the team, one of the star players we can count on. And all this in only a year and a half. I fully expect him to keep growing and being one of the standout players of the league. The second point is that our team isn't built to have just one or two attacking players. We attack as a unit. With all the interchanging and overlapping the players do, we need players at all positions who can score goals. There were a lot of times last year when the ball fell to Hendo or Allen or another player who wasn't able to convert the chance. They're not bad players of course, but we need more players who can strike the ball on target. This would be important even if Luis stayed, if we're ever to fully play the Rodgers way, and doubly so if Luis leaves. 

I just realized I'm wall of texting, but I have a lot of thoughts on the matter. I hope Luis can stay but I don't see his leaving as a bad thing either.

true,Callduron,null,null,"OK let's turn this around.

First off you're absolutely right to feel fed up with sending off application after application and getting nowhere. 

You can change this.

The first step is to try to pick a goal. It doesn't have to be immediately achievable. But it's easier to develop a career as, say, a chef, than a career as ""anything"".

Once you have that figure out who gets hired. There'll be a list and you'll see it in every job ad for that profession. Something like

- diligent

- punctual

- innovative

- has ACCA level 3 (made up qualification)

The next step is to get those skills and qualities or if you have them already to start phrasing your cv, cover letter and interviews to prove these competencies. For instance at one stage in my life I stayed behind after school to help a club  I was a member of with with an event. This is an example of where I was diligent.

Be careful of such words because professions often use them in a narrow sense. For instance ""innovative"" in a chef means you come up with new recipes, not you can invent vacuum cleaners or new ways of filing.

Most competencies are transferrable however - if you collected cash for a jumble sale you can demonstrate cash handling competency when you apply for a retail job.

When you send a cv off it is read (usually) by screening software. To beat this robot you need to have the keywords that the recruiter puts into the software, usually words that are in the job ad.

I would always try to put as many words in as possible to hit these matches. So if they want gcse maths I'd check online for courses and put that I've looked into studying for gcse maths at night school and hope to start this soon. Then if you get the job you can fill that gap in your competencies after they appoint you. I don't think you should ever lie but it can be ok to put intentions in somewhere - in the cover letter if not in the cv.

After all if they want maths and you don't have it you won't get through the screening if you simply dont mention it.

Once you get interviews you can't go smelly. No one will hire you if you pong. I met someone who was looking for work who lived with 2 large dogs and always smelled really strongly (I think the dogs peed on his coat or something). If that's an issue you will have to fix it before you can land most jobs.

Volunteering can be useful to fill in gaps in your competencies. If you want to work with kids say, a voluntary role as a playscheme helper or some such demonstrates a lot of useful competencies.

Lastly I'd suggest you subscribe to /r/entrepreneur. It's not for everyone and sometimes I don't even understand what they're on about but reading some of the trials of people who try business can be quite encouraging. Many start with practically no money and do everything online. You don't have to worry about someone not hiring you since it's your company.

I often even provide opposing opinions and why people think that way. There's always a bad group of anything, and sometimes you wind up only or primarily exposed to that group. Sometimes that leaves a bad taste in your mouth. I don't think there's anything wrong with taking an unpopular stance based on personal experience. If I came on here and said ALL USMT fans are stupid obnoxious assholes, that would be wrong. I've simply supplied an explanation to how Americans can easily not support the USMT. I've stated multiple times that I've had some very good experiences with them, just mostly very bad ones. And again on the previous comment, there is nothing at all wrong with getting excited when your player goes on a good run. I'm just making an example of the ones screaming shoot even when a defender gets a touch near your goal. You have to admit if I came to a Chelsea match you were watching and instead of asking how things worked just started yelling for goals every time we got a touch, you'd eventually get annoyed and probably less likely to help inform me. I will always make polite conversation with opposing fans as I'm typically just happy to have anyone to converse with in the first place. But if you come in and start yelling about how it's bullshit how Dempsey isn't on a top club, and then tell me I don't know what I'm talking about when I try to explain his coming and going through England, I'm just not going to take you seriously.

What kind of boy might actually *need* to play with a doll and why? What kind of boy might insist on playing with a doll? The only answer I can come up with is a boy who is exploring gender or who may even have a nascent gender issue. The very fact that certain toys are girls toys has potentially huge benefits.

If that is the case then here is the perfect reason to keep dolls as nominally girls toys. If we just make them neutral, sure it means normal boys will get something trivially extra to play with; but we take away a whole avenue of self-expression and self-exploration for a huge chunk of our children.

(Obviously vice versa for girls and dolls are just an illustrative example.)

Despite what I've just said, I do like how it feels very natural and the medium, semi matte finish is exactly what I want in a foundation.  It also photographs wonderfully, hence why I've decided to use it for the wedding I'm going to.

The Labour party, feeling the power of one of its constituent parts growing extremely fast, also fought back in an attempt to level the playing field.

Ultimately the issues with the unions that finally led to the winter of discontent were 1) increasing rejection of Keynesian economics by the Tory party ending the period of mutual agreement in government, 2) the soft touch of the Labour party to stop the unions from exerting overt control within its ranks, and 3) the lack of price regulation in a market dominated by socialised industry (which most economists agree is a necessity).",0,1403941844,null,0,false,0,cij6qnb,t3_298p9y,t1_cij6qnb,t1_ciiwmbn,null,1434441173,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Let's start with what's mentioned in the article: dance (and music) and food. 

How many school children in England today could dance a traditional English dance? How many could sing a folk song from memory? How many could prepare--or even recognise--a good number of English dishes?

What about the Church? I'm not talking about belief. But how many children could actually give you a good account of what our national church stands for? Even Dawkins describes himself as a cultural Christian so it can't be all barmy. 

How many children who can describe a Japanese tsunami or Bangladeshi monsoon are able to account for why the North was the seat of the industrial revolution or why their school is on a hill? How can children living in London never even have seen the Thames?

How many children who can name the top ten deadliest snakes are able to identify the birds they see in their local park? How can children living in London not even go to a park regularly?

I think there is a real sense in which we are not equipping our children to engage with their everyday world--both from a historical/cultural perspective and simply the things they find around them. 

I wouldn't for a second suggest the global perspective is wrong. It is rather essential. But you must also grow up able to connect with the immediate world around you with an appreciation for how it's come to be. That comes from valuing it; and valuing it leads you to appreciate it more.

1. The Premier League
2. The Championship League
3. League One
4. League Two

The Premier League is the top tier with the best teams/clubs. League Two has the...*less-good* clubs. At the end of each season, the top three clubs are promoted to the next highest league, and the bottom three clubs are relegated to the next lowest league. 

**Example:** In the 2013/14 season, Norwich City, Fulham, and Cardiff City finished in 18th, 19th, and 20th place of the Premier League, respectively. Next season, those three clubs will be playing in the Championship League. Leicester City, Burnley, and Queens Park Rangers were the top three clubs of the Championship League, and they will be playing in Premier League next season.

The way you stated it^2 is basically right. ""The Championship League"" is just a name. It's sort of like Triple AAA baseball except the teams aren't connected to teams in the upper league.

The Europa League is a tournament, somewhat similar in structure to the World Cup.  Everton qualified for it by placing 5th in the Premier League last season, but they'll still be playing in the Premier League next season as well. Games played in the Europa League will have no effect on Everton's standing in the Premier League and vice-versa.

The League Cup and FA Cup are tournaments comprised only of English clubs.

It sounds very complicated, but it's not at all once you get used to it.

true,WhaleMeatFantasy,null,null,"I think you might just have been being flippant but I think it's actually an interesting question and even gets us somewhere to identifying one set of British values. Bear with me.

There are actually two ways I think you can direct that question: does the Church stand for anything theologically speaking; and does it stand for anything in the culture at large?

Theologically speaking one of the interesting things about the Church of England is just how varied it is. The High Church is very, very high and the Low Church is very low. The C of E is in this sense astonishingly tolerant and conciliatory, and not at all dogmatic.

Further than that, the mainstream theology is actually very progressive (compared to American Protestantism on the one hand and Roman Catholicism on the other). But this intellectual progressiveness sits in a firm framework of tradition.

Yet these are all things that I think reflect traditional British values at large. The lack of dogmatism, for example, *is* peculiarly British. We see it in British intellectual life and the tendency to shy away from systematic theoretical frameworks unlike, say, the Germans. We see it in political life and the fact that we do not have a constitution to rule us like the Americans. The conciliatory nature of the Church is reflected in our approach to multiculturalism which is quite different from the French model. And our taste for tradition is reflected in how we go about everything from parliamentary and military business to all kinds of low-level social interaction.

This is why if we look at the Church and how it goes about its affairs it helps us see in microcosm all sorts of values in our culture at large. And the Church stands up for those values for all people in our society regardless of whether they believe or not.",0,1403944972,null,0,1403946617,0,cij7aeo,t3_29az3z,t1_cij7aeo,t1_cij6xka,null,1434441327,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

true,spiz,null,null,"&gt; In all fairness, under a proper system he would have been formally put forward and forced to campaign in the UK 

This one's a new one that's started popping up everywhere recently.  Juncker's party is the EPP, which is unrepresented in the UK (because the Tories formed the [tiny] AECR instead).  Juncker could not have got a single vote in the UK, even if it was the thing he wanted most in the world.  Why would he campaign in a place where it's physically impossible for him to get a single vote?  What would he do, fly to Heathrow, get off the tube and preach from a soapbox?

Incidentally, he was quite formally put forward as the lead candidate for the EPP.  Much like most lead candidates are.  He was elected internally.  Just like there was no confusion that Cameron would lead a Tory government, there was no confusion about Junker - he won a vote on who would be lead candidate!  If you bothered to read the news, it was always clear.

As for Schulz, he had been on Newsnight before the campaign stated (although when questioned he had refused to comment as he was there as head of the EP), but [Labour told him not to visit on his campaign.](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/437fa804-b663-11e3-905b-00144feabdc0.html#axzz35v6lu1lL)

I mean, first we don't want them, then we complain they didn't come.  It's like complaining the EU Commission President is unelected, then complaining more when they are.

&gt; very few regular people like us actually give a shit

I don't know, you seem pretty concerned.  

&gt; What happened instead was he got put forward in a backroom deal by the EPP and then secured himself a leading position in the EU without ever setting foot in the UK to campaign.

How parties pick politicians is up to them.  [Juncker was chosen in a vote by the EPP](http://www.epp.eu/jean-claude-juncker-elected-epp-candidate-president-european-commission), the members of which are representatives of various parties.   It wasn't a backroom deal.  He didn't set foot in the UK because he's unrepresented.  It's also a bit like Newcastle, for example, saying it's not fair Cameron is PM because he didn't set foot in Newcastle in his campaign and Newcastle didn't vote for him (I'm not really sure if did or didn't - but you get the point).

&gt; That attitude in an of itself tells you a lot about the sort of EU this guy believes in... one where an entire nation of 60 million people can be totally marginalized because the governments of the other 380 million felt differently.

The EU population is actually over 500 million, and as such, the UK is just over 1/10 the population.  It's like Scotland being upset the Tories won and feeling marginalised because Scotland never voted for them.

You also need to remember that we marginalised ourselves.  The Tories left the EPP and consequently had no say in Juncker's election.


As for the rest of your comment, perhaps surprisingly, I mostly agree - except I quite like Cameron (except for his erratic behaviour in Europe).

&gt;In [common law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law) [legal systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_systems_of_the_world), a __precedent__ or __authority__ is a principle or rule established in a previous [legal case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case) that is either binding on or persuasive for a [court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court) or other tribunal when deciding subsequent cases with similar issues or [facts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact). The general principle in [common law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law#2._Common_law_legal_systems_as_opposed_to_civil_law_legal_systems) legal systems is that similar cases should be decided so as to give similar and predictable outcomes, and the principle of precedent is the mechanism by which that goal is attained. [Black's Law Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%27s_Law_Dictionary) defines ""precedent"" as a ""rule of law established for the first time by a court for a particular type of case and thereafter referred to in deciding similar cases.""  [Common law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law#1._Common_law_as_opposed_to_statutory_law_and_regulatory_law) precedent is a third kind of law, on equal footing with [statutory law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutory_law) (statutes and codes enacted by legislative bodies), and [regulatory law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_law) (regulations promulgated by executive branch agencies).

I eventually informed the community MH people about this.

They discharged me with a improved mental haelth score (fabricated) and a nice little message saying Mr **** has made threats to himself and others. Should he act on this again, It should be treated as a criminal matter.

Since then I have been through every hole in the ""safety net"" and ended up in a Triarge ward before Christmas last year.

It has come to nothing. nearly 5 years since being originally referred from my GP and not a single hour of treatment yet.

true,macrocephale,,Resident palaeontologist,"Ha was going to say someone's been watching a little much WWD!
The answer is no- not a single one. A lot of dinosaur remains have been found in marine deposits but these are due to them being dragged out to sea by river currents etc- purely taphonomical reasons.

As far as *Eustreptospondylus* goes, a lot of behaviour from WWD is inaccurate. Europe was covered by a shallow sea at the time (I'm actually working on the fish &amp; sharks from that very sea atm) but there weren't as many islands, and they wouldn't have been big enough to support populations of medium sized theropods. The *Eustreptospondylus* were found in a marine deposit (the stonesfield slate) but the animal was far more likely washed out from the mainland.

The closest there is to marine dinosaurs that we know of are actually penguins, and the Galapagos (iirc) flightless cormorant. Gannets maybe too, and if you count freshwater (""aquatic covers fresh, brackish and marine organisms"") then ducks too!

There are some groups of animals that became fully marine- two completely unrelated groups of crocodiles did so, one the family Metreorhyncidae, became fully marine (the type genus actually lived in the same sea as WWD e3, see Sea Monsters) developing Pliosaur-like paddles and gaining small tail flukes, and were maybe even unable to return to land.

The other group that immediately springs to mind are mostly because of just how weird/awesome it is. Remember Walking With Beasts episode 5? Most people have heard of ""the"" giant ground sloth even if they haven't. Well there were actually hundreds of genera (not just *Megatherium*) and species over the last 15-20 million years. And before the land bridge of Central America formed and the ""great faunal interchange"" happened (South America had been isolated for an incredibly long time and had a very different fauna to the North. When the two were finally joined and lot of Southern animals spread north and vice versa) a group of giant sloths had spread from the South to the North, and all the way up the western coast of what is now North America

However these were no ordinary giant ground sloths. These were **GIANT MARINE SLOTHS**. Just think about that for a minute! Giant sloths. That were fully adapted to marine life. They actually had quite a diversity too, there wasn't just one species. There's a good TetZoo article on them that I'll try and find when I get out of bed and off my phone!- god that was hard to type out, I'm still getting used to my new one which has a differently proportioned keyboard the one I was used to, I get so many errors typing I have to go back over!",0,1403948490,null,0,1404002395,0,cij7tll,t3_296zie,t1_cij7tll,t1_cij784q,null,1435487335,2,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,2

That is why some countries (like France, Germany and the UK) are more important than other countries and get more say in the decisions that are made... because the hard truth is that the EU needs Germany a lot more than it needs Portugal or Greece for example.

I **do** agree that separately, this issue could have been avoided if Cameron hadn't left the EPP. Ironically, within the EPP Cameron probably could have prevented Junker getting the job and would have more influence over EU legislation. Having said that, it's a bit of a *""fucked if you do, fucked if you don't""* situation... he had to be seen to do something by his own parties Euroskeptics and at the time leaving the EPP probably seemed like something that would get him political capital in the UK without costing him much in Europe. Clearly that was shortsighted and goes to show that sometimes building bridges pays off in the long run vs burning them. 

--------

Separately, I note per my prediction that Merkel has come out today making concessions to Cameron - and that's because she knows if she doesn't Cameron will be forced to throw a spanner in the works further down the line to restore credibility domestically. The UK are well known for playing diplomatic hardball (it's one of the reasons we are so unpopular in Europe where they prefer consensus decision making).

If teams qualify for Continental Competition, they still play Domestic football in addition to the European games.

Personal argument with no proof, not a fact.


&gt; I find it disgusting to see a team with an history of sportsmanship and fair play with such a nasty player. 


Personal opinion. 


&gt; I didn't like it when some ""Liverpool-fans"" stood by Luis Suarez when he was racially insulting others and I hope they wont stand by him the third time he's bitten someone. 


Personal opinion. 


&gt; Cant even believe I have to comment on a lfc player biting someone its abhorrent .
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Luis Suarez is a racist, a diver and obviously still has the mentality of a toddler.


Racism was unproven, most players dive, mentality issue is a little insulting and again your opinion. 


&gt; Have to get rid of him if the club is going to retain any sense of self-respect. It wouldn't be as bad if he actually came out and apologized instead of hiding behind a national team with a history of vile players that of course will defend that type of behavior. Liverpool aren't like Uruguay we are meant to have class.


Personal opinion and subtle generalization towards south Americans all being vile.


 
&gt; Anyone defending him isn't a lfc fan they are a Suarez fan and we don't need them. This club has a history of great players with great attitudes.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; We don't need that tarnished.

true,DevilishRogue,cnty-england,England,"&gt; Not many, but the current government have been the first to successfully prosecute people under the new law. So if anything the Equalities Minister is doing what you want them to do. 

Credit for what they've done but they need to keep at it instead of wasting time trying to dictate how shops present their wares.

&gt; I'm not sure you understand. How are we going to identify people that are at risk of this crime? It's not as if the victims of this crime are already in contact with social workers before it happens. How are we going to anticipate who we should focus this attention on?

There are risk analyses that work as tools to determine those most likely to be at risk and children are exposed to other state servants (teachers, doctors, etc.) who could carry out these assessments.

&gt; I assure you that social workers are fully aware of the issues that the communities that they serve face. Michael Gove has personally written to every school in the country, apparently. I'm not really sure what you think the government should be doing here that isn't already being done.

I've indicated above where I think the shortfalls in government action are and it doesn't help that we have an equalities minister undermining this and wasting time on insignificant and morally questionable issues like how private businesses sell toys.

&gt; Is it particularly bad that the Equalities Minister is targeting a business for criticism? Should the Equalities Minister focus solely on other government entities? Or is it alright for the Equalities Minister to criticise private individuals as long as these private individuals are not conducting business?

The equalities minister can legitimately target any private businesses for criticism if those business discriminate unlawfully, but if they don't then then at best the ministers actions are misguided.",0,1403951071,null,0,false,0,cij886s,t3_298xvn,t1_cij886s,t1_ciixbt1,null,1434441774,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

He racketeers them all as well, but then the UVF does actually protect them in a way from small time crims. 

Go down Dee Street or Lord Street and ask anyone what they think of him or his mates. Old women sing his fucking praises. They love him. He protects them from the taigs in the Short Strand who like to come out at protests and shoot photographers, or throw bricks and petrol bombs over the interface. 

Or who used to like to blow up paint shops on the albert bridge road during the troubles and kill bus drivers (O'Rooney and O'Donnaghaile Senior). Or throw bottles of piss and paint at them on the 12th when they march down their own road. 

They are just defending their area from the taigs who attack them when they do nothing but try to live their way. Remember the snipers in St Matthew's Church? 

That's their opinion of it as best I can put it, and to the best of my knowledge. I don't agree with it. Steven Matthews is the leader of their tribe. That's why it goes up and stays up.

Not to mention he and the UVF work with the police on many issues. So they let him away with having his wee empire because they can control him in it. ",0,1403951724,null,0,false,0,cij8bqd,t3_29aexd,t1_cij8bqd,t3_29aexd,null,1434441839,15,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,15

In spite of this, I went on to study History at university.

I can appreciate though how many in the UK feel they didn't vote for him, and really the EPP should have campaigned more in the UK to make their presence known. There were televised candidate debates in the run up the elections, but these weren't widely aired on British television. Really, about the only thing the British public ever heard about during the European elections was UKIP.

Because the article talks about Osbrone claiming that austerity has not caused in inequality, and frankly, it hasn't, this article is pure spin.  To claim it's created in equality when levels are similar to how they were before the recession is not just obviously wrong, you have to be incredibly will full to use such untruth.

[It still remains that in-equality is lower today than it was under the previous government](http://www.gini-research.org/system/uploads/513/original/United-Kingdom.pdf?1380182986#10)

&gt;claiming a massive economic recovery because the very rich are now more better off than the poor are worse off is sneaky use of language at best and lying at worst.


It also depends what you mean by better or worse off.  GINI is a bit of a problem, because it would show a decrease if you hypothetically suddenly taxed everyone over £30k, £30k, obviously this would plunge many people into a poverty, they would struggle to afford food let along anything else.  But the GINI would be lower.  It's a stupid hypothetical, but it shows the issues with GINI as a measure of prosperity and real concept of inequality, as in that hypothetical, you'd have a small minority for whom life would go by un-effected.  This is the problem with it as a measure.

It comes to measuring things in Money, I live and work in London.  If I'm not cycling, my travel costs are quite high for my commute, my taxes, bills, mortgage are large.  As a result I always think that someone on say £15k pa in Cornwall would have a better quality of life than someone on £25k in London.

As such people try and use a disposable income GINI, this is what the figure they are quoting here is based on.  This obviously is fraught with issues of what constitutes disposable income, when you are talking about the moral case of inequality you want to really be careful about this.  Compare the cost of a pint in London vs Cornwall.  As a maths/engineer/cs geek at heart, I always use the examples of computers.  I'm probably buying a new laptop for work use, as my old one is on it's last legs (dropped a few too many times, and now has a bad earth) I could quite easily use a £300 one, laptops today are amazingly fast.  Realistically?  Probably going to be more like £1200, it's going to be very light, *waffer thin* if you will.  This is a good example of how income inequality is hard to measure.  How much better is my life with a £1200 laptop than a £300 one?  Is a £600 iPhone a massively different thing than a £60 Nokia WP?

Now we factor in the context of the governments '*austerity*' package, I put it in quotes like that because we've not seen a real terms decrease in spending, only a decrease on the increase of spendings, I guess first derivative austerity isn't as punchy.  The question is how much will that have shifted the disposable income GINI?  That is very hard to say, I think the fact we've seen inflation in housing will have probably shifted that the most, however that isn't really due to austerity.

The biggest rise of inequality I've seen over the last 10 years, is a shift of age and wealth.

Also, each nation gets an allotment of teams that can play in Europe each year, based on their national co-efficient (ie. How well teams from that country have done in previous years). Currently Spain are top (by a mile), England second and Germany third, this means they can take 7 teams into Europe (4 in CL and 3 to Europa).

Behind them are the slightly smaller leagues that are still successful (France, Italy, Ukraine, Portugal, Netherlands and Russia), these can take 6, then it is down from there. 

Nations can improve their co-efficient by having a good few years, but they are worked out over the past 5 seasons- so one bad year won't kill you off. 

It is also up to the nations to work out how they are going to distribute the places.

This brings me onto cup competitions; domestically, there are two forums all teams play in; league and cup. The league is how it sounds, each team plays each other twice (although some nations have a twist on this concept), you get 3 points for a win, 1 for a draw and the total points are all added up at the end of a season, and the one with the most takes home the trophy (relegation has been explained elsewhere, so I will avoid that).

Cup competition is a bit different, it is based on a knockout concept- where teams are drawn at random, and the winner progresses. In England we have 2 major Cup Competitions, and a bunch of minor ones, that you will probably never hear about.

The two 'top flight' ones are the FA Cup (the oldest in world football, hugely prestigious and legendary... also the last thing that Everton won) and The League Cup (not prestigious, and most top teams will use it to test out new  tactics and give youth academy players a chance.. It is however a path to silverware, and not something to be scoffed at). 

To put things bluntly, we are not going to win The League anytime soon. We are a big club with a small budget, and it is next to impossible to compete with the financial behemoths, unless we manage to find a player like Suarez. The Cup however is well within our reach. We have shown over the past season that we can beat any team, and Goodison Park is one of the most feared grounds in the country for top teams to play at.

Whilst the final is at Wembley (and the Semi Final for the FA Cup) we have the players to beat anyone... And a manager who has done just that, as Roberto Martinez beat Man City to win the FA Cup the season before he started at Everton with a much, much, much smaller team than Everton.

Back to the European places... bringing everything full circle; Top 4 get champions league, 5th gets Europa, and the winners of the Cup Competitions get the other 2 Europa places- if they already have them through League position, then they get given to 6th place (as happened this season) and 7th place.",0,1403955746,null,0,false,0,cij8zo4,t3_29a99h,t1_cij8zo4,t1_cij8q95,null,1434442310,3,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,3

He is definatelly a lot better since he spent some time at Benfica, I watched him at Serbia's frendlies and he really showed some world class abilities, although I kind of expected more of him, with all the hype in Serbia about him.

Fundamentally it was the idea that societies formed organically always leading to wealthy elites and cliques and that the rich and middle classes, living in one society, had a moral obligation to help and redistribute to the poor, particularly as in an organic and interconnected society they could themselves end up in need. The activist and redistributive policies of Stanley Baldwin and then Neville Chamberlain were why poorer voters aligned conservative over Labour or Liberal during the Great Depression.

The fundamental difference between One Nation Conservatism and socialism was that Conservatives felt that redistribution should be targeted at the poor rather than all of society as they felt that over-redistribution led to statism and the poor needed it more. It fell out of favour in the seventies as it didn't seem to have a solution to a lot of the problems of globalisation, decolonisation and increasing unionisation of the era, and also because many people felt the patrician ""noblesse oblige"" attitude of middle class and wealthy Tories was patronising and jarred with some voters.

Errr... http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23401076

It's pretty clear that all ISPs right now are installing new filters.

&gt; This is slightly above my area of expertise (I work for the household name in networking but I don't have to touch BGP on real production networks), but I popped one of BT's subnets into a couple of looking glasses and it seems a bit inconclusive. AT&amp;T's LG thinks that the route to 194.72.0.0/16 is only a couple of hours old, HE thinks it's a few days old. Something went bang, possibly?

LG data might not tell you much here because the route was still being advertised when possibly it shouldn't. What you'd need to do is look at traffic crossing the peer network. Lots in + little out = route should not be advertised because something is broken. The only people who are going to see that data are BT's and the peer network's engineers.

&gt; Whatever the fault is, it must not have affected their 21CN, because it doesn't seem to have affected anyone on any of the ISPs who use BT Wholesale/Openreach to get to their customers - only BT Retail (and not even Plusnet, which is owned by BT but has their own network)

Yeah, sounds more like a routing error at BT on their retail network. 21CN delivers to other ISPs and they then route out onto the Internet themselves. It seems like BT's peering was a bit stuffed then.

That's not law though - that's a wish by Cameron (he's trying to pass a law but it hasn't happened yet), and there's been no public movement on the issue except for BT, Sky, TalkTalk (who all have filters) and possibly Virgin. None of the smaller providers seem up for it unless absolutely forced to, and I don't blame them.

BT are already complying with Cameron's desires, they were one of the first to do filtering.

&gt; LG data might not tell you much here because the route was still being advertised when possibly it shouldn't. What you'd need to do is look at traffic crossing the peer network. Lots in + little out = route should not be advertised because something is broken. The only people who are going to see that data are BT's and the peer network's engineers.

true,lithaborn,eng-westmidlands,West Midlands,"&gt; Researchers called on the Department for Education to develop a ""curriculum that treats white British identity in the same way as ethnic minorities”.

Were it being treated as a local issue, then nobody would be calling on the DfE, which, last time I looked, made the rules for the national curriculum, not simply local schools.

The whole tone of the report reads like this is a national issue, to be tackled on a national scale. While there's regular mention of Lambeth, there's little to no time given to the consideration that an inner city borough like Lambeth might encounter different problems than schools in a district in, say, rural Yorkshire.

The report states that they have ""Black History Month"" and ""Portugese Day"" but don't have a ""British Day"". I'd like to ask them what they think **every other day except these special days** are if they're not British Culture days...with their normal, regular British fare in the canteens, with their state required Anglican assemblies, with their lessons focussed around a British curriculum, learning about British things...

What it boils down to is this abrogation of responsibilities by lazy or clueless (or yes, far too fucking busy) parents who can't or don't want to devote enough time to their kids. If you're willing to have kids, you have to accept responsibility for them. The school isn't there to do everything for you, you have to teach them and entertain them and *bring them up* too!

It should be a criminal offense not to live within a stone's throw of such a huge national icon as the centre of London and not have your kids know it off by heart, for example.

I live in Birmingham and I'm on ESA and I could take my kids to London once a month if I wanted. I happen to not want to because I think it's crowded and rude and smelly and expensive and dirty and a vile place, but I'm willing to do it just because I don't want my kids to say they've never been to London...and that's someone living 100 miles away!

How modern sociology clings to the idea that ""we're all the same at birth"" despite the incontrovertible evidence is beyond me. It calls the entire subject into suspicion for me.

I'd assume Lallana is being brought because he offers a more physical presence, and in turn that can help the defence, the area in which we looked most vulnerable last season. 

However one thing you can not deny, is that Lallana does add much needed depth to a squad where Aspas was Luis Alberto were our only shining lights on the bench last season both of whom were wholly ineffectual. Sterling, Cou and Lallana all have the ability to change games, so it is a very good option to have. However you do have to ask, if he is the one intended for third place Attacking midfielder, if 25M is simply too much for such a player. 

But in all fairness, I am biased as I never wanted him anyway.

On the one hand you say the quran is a book full of violence, on the other you say that extremists are a minority.


&gt; However, I'm criticizing the *ideology* of Islam as described in The Quran and hadiths.

Do you even know enough about it to be able to judge?

If the vast majority of muslims are decent, peaceful people maybe the texts aren't what drives muslims towards extremism. 

&gt;However, do you not find it troubling that it's easy to find verses which promote violence?  

Not if they aren't actually promoting violence and clearly for most muslims the quran isnt inspiring people to violence.

So if its not the quran and hadiths, what is the cause of extremism? 

&gt;Even if most Muslims manage to ignore or rationalize such verses, do you not think that these sections could be a real problem for a minority?

Its a common misconception that its the texts that cause muslims to be violent, an idea propogated by various islamic hate sites. The idea that it is Islam that leads people to violence is a nonsense. 

What does lead people to violence is the political ideology of islamism. Not all islamist ideologies are violent, but some are. A common theme across all islamist ideologies is the need for an islamic state ruled by sharia.  

The modern concept of the islamic state was defined by [Abul A'la Mawdudi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abul_A'la_Maududi) who actually used ideas of western philosophers (Hegel's philosophy of history and Marx/Lenin's vanguardism) to justify it. 

http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5De09u2P_JYC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=hegel+maududi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sJ3Umc0Ju4&amp;sig=IVKEuniB_z7mUbtL2ovhYacsDY0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=z7OuU6_gFdLX7AbKt4GQBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=hegel%20maududi&amp;f=false

Controversially he also wrote that muslims aren't just muslims because that is what is written on their birth certificate, if they accept man-made law over sharia they should not consider themselves muslims. 

He believed that to create an islamic state would require a vanguard of islamic intellectuals. 

http://www.newstatesman.com/religion/2010/02/islamic-society-mawdudi

His work was picked up by Sayyed Qutb who also suggested that only the muslim vanguard fighting for an islamic state can consider themselves muslim, all the other so called birth-certficate muslims are basically kaffir - non believers, false muslims.

http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Qutbism#Takfir

These ideas are radical departures from classical islam which had legal checks and balances inherent in the sharia  system. For example there is a process regarding apostates  who reject islamic belief, you cant simply just kill them willy nilly because you declare they arent muslim. However these political ideologues have promoted takfir, offensive jihad

It is these ideologies that came out of the first half of the twentieth century that are the real roots of islamic extremism. 
Islamic extremism, salafi jihadism, qutbism, takfir and the modern concept of [offensive jihad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_jihad) all developed in the last hundred years. 

The reason some muslims turn towards jihad and extremism is because of these modern ideologies. Islamism is a philosophy that strives to create a political solution (an islamic state, ruled by a caliph and run according to shariah). 

This is why some muslims turn towards extremism and others dont.

When you get to Pen Y Fan, if your not feeling adventurous then there is the ""motorway"" up from Storey arms car park but my favourite is from Neuadd reservoir. I am pretty sure [this](http://www.walkingclub.org.uk/book_3/walk_85/index.shtml) is the route - but I never have really looked it up having been loads. A bit of a warning with this the first climb is a bit hard going but after that you are golden, don't be put off by the hard first hour or so.


If you do venture further west along the M4 then I can highly recommend the [4 waterfalls walk](http://www.walkscene.co.uk/description_52/Brecon_Beacons_4_waterfalls_walk_near_Ystadfellte.html). I did this a few years ago, mid week and it was amazing. We did not see another human for 3 hours! This takes in the lovely [Sgwd yr Eira](https://www.flickr.com/search?sort=relevance&amp;text=Sgwd%20yr%20Eira).

Also if there is money left on it you might be able to get it back off the estate agent or whoever when you move out. I vaguely recall we were able to do that, they added a tenner or however much it was back on to the deposit they returned to us.

EDIT: While we're on this subject, I'll post a bit of a rant but also a heads up to anyone moving into a house that is metered.  
I had to put up with that shit for a whole year a few years back, and fuck me it was a lot more expensive than the standard direct debit method. The person who lived there before us was apparently quite poor and had opted to have the meter installed, supposedly believing she'd be able to manage her bills better. Apparently she was unaware of just how much of a massive increase in cost it actually is (literally £100+ per year, may not sound like much to some, but if you're poor this is huge). After a few months we realised this and asked to have the meter removed so we could live like normal people - 6 fucking months it could take - by that time we'd be coming to the end of the contract so it was almost pointless getting it done.

Luckily we weren't in a dire financial situation so we could manage it fine, but they really need to do away with meters or put the cost down to the same as paying by direct debit, if you're actually poor then £100 is quite a lot of money extra you're having to pay. Not only that but you have the added hassle of having to get it topped up every week or whatever, and you're paying more for this hassle. Ridiculous.

So yeah, ask if you can have the meter removed, your bank account will be happier.",0,1403960902,null,0,1403961732,0,cija039,t3_29bbvg,t1_cija039,t3_29bbvg,null,1434442755,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3

I'm worried about the sum because we have a finite amount of money to spend just like every club but I'm more worried because I'm a bit underwhelmed by him as a target for our valuable first team positions. I think he's a good player don't get me wrong but he is not and will never be anything near a world beater which is a mistake IMO because in our position we should be buying players who could reach that level ie. Can.

Pros to buying Lallana;

He's a captain

He's been successful in the league with a team with a similar-ish style to ourselves

He's obviously talented and will likely play better in a better team

He can score and assist a fair amount of goals which we need

He can dribble

He covers a shitloads of ground (similar to hendo)

Cons

He's 26

He's expensive which puts more pressure on a player

He's only had one stand out year in the premier league

His ceiling has probably been reached or close to it and that ceiling 
isn't jaw dropping

He's not very fast

I personally think he's overrated (sorry Adam I'll love you soon)

Having said all this when if he puts on that jersey he's one of us and I will give him all the support in the world and the full benefit of the doubt until he proves otherwise.

and took notes:

1. We are currently working in a system which is based on conflict. ie survival of the fittest and we expect this to deliver us a fair and equitable society (lol). This creates a nation of bullies and psychopaths.

2. Need to redesign economy to encourage the best possible outcomes. To build more we should share more. Create a system which allows the most possible people to ""win"".

3. The basic problem with the UK economy is the labour market structure - essentially, 1 in 5 people earn around £25-30K, 3 in 5 earn less than £25K. Half earn less than £21K and 1 in 3 earn less than £14K. If in Scotland, they adopted a ""nordic"" pay structure. ie less for those at the top and more for those at the bottom, that would generate an additional £4 billion in tax. (which would fix Scotlands budget deficit)

4. GDP does not create wealth amongst citizens. Only wages create wealth amongst citizens.

5. Identify and tax wealth extracting industries. (eg Housing &amp; big retail)

6. Get back to investment culture (create national investment bank to invest in infrastructure). National grid back into public ownership. Create ""National Mutual Companies"" for running public services - every citizen owns a share in the company and gets paid a dividend. 

7. Use National Mutuals to invest in industries which don't currently exist -for example, German style housing factories to create absolutely top notch rental housing.

8. No borrowing to finance budget deficit. Taxes to eliminate deficit. Borrowing for investment only.

9. Industrial democracy. UK currently 27th out of 28 in Europe. Workforce currently unable to negotiate a fair share of wealth. Successful companies involve their workers in governance. Currently in UK employees are minimum wage, zero hours contract and basically don't care.

10. Industrial policy. The economy is a system of social provisioning. If it isn't doing this successfully (ie people do not have the goods and services they require, the economy is failing). Local economies are more important that the global economy. local provides most of the jobs and supplies most of the goods/services.

11. Ownership of the economy is crucial - ie who owns the companies. Should use procurement policy to protect industry and create jobs in a sensible way.

12. Tax corporations on the basis of global turnover. (This enables domestic companies to compete with multinationals who are off-shoring their profits to tax havens)

13. Biggest problem in UK economic theory is ""Magic Button Theory"". ie There is a single magic button that if you press it will fix the economy. Press it more and it will fix it more. Instead need ""sector forums"". For each industry sector get industry stakeholders together to find out what is needed to stimulate each sector. Bottom up rather than top down.

Well worth watching the vid though. If Scotland get independence and pull this off maybe the rest of the UK will be encouraged to follow in their footsteps. 

Almost brought a tear to my eye to imagine what it could be like if this worked. Somebody make this guy Prime Minister of the UK :) !

We have to do this if we want to keep the UK within the European Union – which I would like to do as Commission President. As Commission President, I will work for a fair deal with Britain. A deal that accepts the specificities of the UK in the EU, while allowing the Eurozone to integrate further. The UK will need to understand that in the Eurozone, we need more Europe, not less. On the other hand, the other EU countries will have to accept that the UK will never participate in the euro, even if we may regret this. We have to accept that the UK will not become a member of the Schengen area. And I am also ready to accept that the UK will stay outside new EU institutions such as the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, meant to improve the fight against fraud in the EU, but clearly rejected by the House of Commons and the House of Lords. We have to respect such clear positions of the British Parliament, based on the British “opt out” Protocol. David Cameron has recently written down a number of further key demands in an article published in the Daily Telegraph.

It would be pretty bizarre if everyone suddenly ditched their manifestos and started doing things completely differently.

The EU will definitely get closer in some respects (things like the media rights need a central body, so EU broadcasters and startups can compete better internationally with American ones), but we won't see a federal Europe for several decades at least, if ever.

true,Ghoul12,null,null,"I didn't dismiss cultural interventions. I simply stated that the cause of the gender differences is biological in nature. I'm sorry but when we have proven that there are differences in hemispheric wiring of the brain between men and women, that result in men generally being more inclined to perception and cognition, whereas woman are generally more inclined to socialization and communication, that isn't something you can just dismiss as ""weak evidence"".

I'm not saying that there is no such thing as women being discouraged from being in STEM. I'm sure that, especially in previous generations when women were taught to sew and things like that, and were told ""the other stuff is for the boys"", that it did have a huge outcome.

I think that there is still probably lots of that going on now.. but this still doesn't contend with the deeper point. You will never see absolute equity in numbers between men and women in STEM (unless it is enforced by quotas, which if the feminists get their way it will soon be). To be successful at these things requires dedication and above all DESIRE. Many women do desire to be successful in these areas and then go on to do so, but the reason their numbers are SO much less than men, is because these things don't appeal to women as much as they do to men, because of the way our brains are different.

I've already conceded that I'm sure that some women who otherwise would have wanted to go into STEM ended up not doing so because of culture, or because they were pressured out of it. 

The reason some countries, particularly poor ones, have so many women going into STEM is because STEM careers are a ticket out of poverty in many cases. The point remains that, in a wealthy country like ours where people generally have a choice of what they want to study at university, and don't have to do something because otherwise their family will starve, women will generally pick STEM at a lesser rate than men.

To say that without culture and gender roles men and women would go into STEM in equal numbers is to dismiss the PROVEN fact that our brains are wired differently. At the very least you must admit that without cultural conditioning there would still be a disparity. To deny this is to go in the face of modern neuroscience and what we know about the brain.",0,1403965666,null,0,false,0,cijb968,t3_298xvn,t1_cijb968,t1_cij9y27,null,1434443491,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

We actually want to promote Bitcoin so much that we are offering a free loan on an android tablet to the first few (5-10) businesses in our area that agree to start accepting so that they can test accepting bitcoins without any initial investment.

We replace the exact number of pounds that the business quotes its customers essentially providing a 0% fee service for as long as we will be economically able to do so.

If you know of any merchants that want to start accepting bitcoins anywhere in the UK, we are able to offer the same service but require that they provide their own device. This can be a mobile with a data connection, or an android or ipad tablet. We can send setup instructions.

We have created our selling site, https://coinduit.io to facilitate the exchange of these bitcoins into pounds so that we may repay the merchants. Right now the limits are low as we are in a testing phase. Feedback is appreciated.

*  £750/month is quite expensive for that location. 
* As /u/allofthethings said, an agreement without a viewing wouldn't bind you. Reputable landlords/agents won't sign until the tenant has seen the place. 
* The landlord wants to you to sign a contract for 12 months? Beware. A standard Short Term Assured Tenancy lasts for six months, and after that either party can terminate the agreement on a month's notice. Again, reputable landlords/agencies won't pressure you to sign up for 12 - especially not sight unseen. 

I'd suggest sucking up the expense and renting a holiday flat for a few weeks after you get here. Give yourself time to look at places and sign a contract on a flat you have actually seen. But don't get your hopes up for a dishwasher. Most rental flats don't have them. Neither do most private properties!

true,Sonawi,null,null,"Hey! UK student here (soon to be graduate!), thought I'd recommend some universities since I did comprehensive research when applying myself in 2011...

We're privileged to have a LOT of good universities here, so you want to narrow it down based on what you're looking for. It sounds like location is important to you, so I'll suggest a variety on that basis. I'm also suggesting universities which have the best reputations academically, often falling within the top of UK league tables (our ranking system), but if this isn't a concern, there are plenty more to choose from...

SMALLER CITIES

- OXFORD and CAMBRIDGE are the UK's oldest and most famous universities. Both are very close to London (no more than an hour by train), are rich in history and culture themselves and definitely have a Harry Potter-esque 'studenty' feel. Oxford is slightly larger and more urban than Cambridge, but they are both known for their beautiful architecture and rivers. However, they are extremely competitive to get into and require you to sit entrance exams and interviews. 

- If you're looking for somewhere else with a traditional 'studenty' feel, DURHAM is a very similar university in the North-East of England. It's a small city (one of the safest in England) and has a very close-knit student community. Like Oxford and Cambridge, it is organised into a collegiate system, which means you belong to a particular college for the duration of your study (a bit like the houses in Harry Potter). It's certainly beautiful but a bit on the small side, so it may feel a bit claustrophobic if you're used to bigger cities! (I go here and absolutely love it, so happy to give more insight if required!)

- YORK university is another great choice. The city is stunning, very similar to Durham in architecture and possibly one of the most beautiful in the North of England, with loads of relics of its Roman/Viking history. The downside is that the university campus is 20-30 mins walk from the city, so it's quite separate from the city itself.

- EXETER, BATH and BRISTOL are probably the best universities in the South-West of England. They're quite small cities (relatively speaking) but there are lots of shops and things to do. Bristol's slightly bigger and more connected for travelling purposes, but Exeter is nearer the coast and beaches, so again, it depends what you're after!

LARGER CITIES

- London has a wide range of universities, perhaps the most notable ones being University College London (UCL), London School of Economics (LSE) and Imperial College London [All very competitive]. However, there's also Royal Holloway (just out of the centre and renowned for its gorgeous grounds), Queen Mary, King's College London and many others. The beauty of studying in London is that there is obviously so much to do and explore! The massive downside is the cost of living - it is VERY expensive! Because it's so huge, there isn't necessarily the same feeling of a close-knit student community that you have at other universities. 

- EDINBURGH is a really excellent university way up in Scotland. It's a wonderful city with loads of culture and history, but not quite as sprawling as London. The only downside I can think of is the harsh winter weather and the fact it's a bit of a trek from other UK cities, if you're planning on travelling around a bit. Being a capital city, it's also quite expensive.

- BIRMINGHAM is the second largest city in the UK and its university recently won 'University of the Year'. It's in the centre of the country so excellent rail connections for wherever you want to go! It's not as 'pretty' as some of the other places I've mentioned but it's very cosmopolitan got a decent reputation and there's a lot to see and do there.

These are just ten off the top of my head. There are so
 many more but I'm going to stop there before I overwhelm you. If you want to check out more info, look at the Complete University Guide for more suggestions and detailed information:
http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/

TL;DR -Oxford, Cambridge, Durham, York, Exeter, Bath, Bristol, London (many), Edinburgh, Birmingham

Hope this helps!

Even in societies where there is no mass media or commercially produced toys, this dynamic exists.

If you're going to have 60% LTV by doing a straight forward remortgage you'd be mad to choose anything other than a 5 year fix. Especially if you're going to have kids soon. 

Capital raising remortgages usually only allow the raised capital for a BTL investment as opposed to stock and shares ISA investment. 

BTLs can be done on 20% deposit but make an awful lot more sense at 25%. You could have an interest only mortgage (interest is a business expense, capital is not) and use it to supplement the single income. 

If the money left over from the rent recieved after the mortgage, landlords insurance, lettings agent costs and taxes are accounted for etc is larger than the saving made on a straightforward remortgage to a better rate by a sizeable amount I'd be tempted to it.

Firstly, there is NO SUCH THING as the ""bristol to bath cycle track"" it is the ""bristol to bath railway path"" and it is EQUALLY open to walkers and cyclists, including walkers with dogs. SUSTRANS includes walking, including recreational walking, including dog walking. 

No one group of users has privileged status and we all need to co-operate, and SOMETIMES, especially with kids and dogs around, things will go wrong...so cycle and walk considerately. most people do. I do both.

There are times when dogs or small children cause cyclists to brake hard...my own dog has once or twice and i apologise and the bike owners have smiled and cycled on...because they weren't cunts. 

Equally, when cyclists see how i step to the side and instruct my dog to wait to let them pass they usually offer a friendly ""thank you"". Co-operation. it happens, and it works. 

I have had to jump out the way or drag my dog out of the path of overzealous cyclists. They have apologised and i've smiled understandingly - because I too am a cyclist who uses the path, and i know what its like from their seat and from my bike i too have been on the receiving end of a dog, a kid or a pedestrian who wasn't paying attention. it happens.

...and because i am not a wanker and neither were those overzealous cyclists or other users,well. i just get over it. After all it was just a momentary ""oops"", and is forgotten - particuluarly if it was caused by a dog or a kid, both of whom live in a lovely little happy place where they RIGHTLY ASSUME that the big smart adults (on bikes or not) are looking out for them.

Sadly there are the cunts who think the path belongs to them. they TEND to be cyclists and they act like its exclusively a cycle path and everyone else should keep off. they call it the ""cycle path"".

My own worst experience on the path was caused by a cyclist who raged at me and my dog...who has been raised cycle savvy, walked on that path every day since he was 6 weeks old... who was on a lead,...on the grassy picnic area by the fishponds fish (so nowhere near the actual tarmac)...on the mile of the cycle track which i personally pay to sponsor...while i was voluntarilly picking litter beside the track to keep it nice for all of us. Not only did he hurl abuse at me and tell me to keep the dog on a lead and for us both to keep the fuck off the ""cycle"" path, he also failed (as he whizzed by) to watch where he was going, or see the lead that my dog was on. well fuck that cunt, and his antisocial attitude. i hope he fell off his bike and hurt himself and i hope a dog had the pleasure of causing his mishap. 

Fuck the occasional pedestrian cunt too. fuck all the cunts who use the path...but know this. 99% of people who use it are genuinely nice people who co-exist, and, when things accidentally go wrong, they smile and forgive.

true,TechJesus,null,null,"&gt; lt be a big mistake if Britain leaves the EU. At least 40% of British trade is with the EU and while that trade may continue, it will be on the EU's terms. Britain would have no influence on decision making and would still have to comply with all EU regulations and laws in order for British goods and services to comply with EU laws and regulations. 

Part of the reason for that is our inability to negotiate independently with other countries. When we joined the EEC we had to sever many trading connections with the Commonwealth, for instance.

The notion that you have to be part of a trading bloc in order to run a succesful economy is also baloney. Singapore is one of the most succesful states in the world in this regard, and is an independent city, not a bloated federation. Its more how you manage it.

In the short term we will probably suffer, but in the long term it could be for the best, especially given the regulatory zeal of Brussels.

&gt;In addition I am very concerned about the free movement of labour that Britain could lose as a result of withdrawal from the EU. People need to think very carefully about these issues and realize that leaving the EU will have consequences.

If your getting stopped basically you need to be told by who, why, and that you are detained. Generally you can get nicked for not stopping, not giving your name and not 
giving your address when stopped/searched.

As for filming there is no law that specifically bans filming the police there is also no law that specifically says you can always film the police. Police can use reasonable force to search you, if you get in their face with a phone and don't let them search you they can and will take that phone for the duration of that search.

As for self defence it's all common law, you can use reasonable force to defend yourself and others. Reasonable force is what you believe was necessary and nothing more. That can range from grabbing an arm to killing someone with an axe. It's all about how you can justify yourself.

You also have the power of arrest for indictable offences, which also gives you the legal power to use reasonable force to arrest a person you believe to have committed and offence. If I remember rightly.

So.

The main reason why there was high unemployment for Somalis because most of Somalis arrived here in the UK recently. Do you really expect Somalis to learn language, culture, etc and get job at same time instant they arrive in the UK? That's not possible. Most of them will need go to some adult college to learn language and get some qualification to get a skilled job, and it's significantly harder for them to get job due to huge gap in their CVs.

1/3 Muslim children grow up in a workless household can be explained by the fact that they usually have bigger family (around 3-5 children) with only one parent (for Somalis) and also the same reason as previous paragraph.


&gt;Now which group are most of the people who commit FGM from?

Not religion issue. [MCB says it's unislamic](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jun/23/female-genital-mutilation-muslim-council-britain-unislamic-condemn). Somalis are working to reduce this issue in Somalia. This issue will be gone soon.
&gt;Which group is the only group whose women are dressed up like ninjas to go buy something from the shop?

Depending what you mean by ""dressed up like ninjas"". If you mean that by this [dress](http://www.360fashion4u.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Islamic-Clothing-1.gif), then you're incorrect because [nuns](http://images.halloweencostumes.com/products/9995/1-1/replica-nun-costume.jpg) wears similar dressing. If you mean burka, then that's only extreme minority of Muslims wear it.

&gt;Which group takes up the majority of our secret services time? 

There's no evidence of Muslims taking up majority of our secret services time. In fact, if I had to guess, it would be surveillance on secret agents from other countries as well as exploiting security holes/making deals with companies.

&gt;Which group does the only real terrorist threats facing this country come from? 

As of how things are going on, I would say white supremacists like [Anders Breivik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Behring_Breivik) is a real threat to us.

&gt;Which group has 500 young men fighting for terrorist groups abroad? 

The ""extremists"", and [we're taking action on this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/298x7c
/mosques_launch_campaign_to_stop_uk_syria_fighters/)

&gt;Which group has corrupted schools and politics in areas where they are present in high numbers? 

The trojan horse? [It may be fake after all](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/23/world/europe/reading-writing-and-allegations-muslim-school-at-center-of-debate.html?ref=europe&amp;_r=1). Even if that were to be true, you shouldn't tar whole community based on actions of the few. Politics? [It has been discussed at here and this issue is more of cultural problem rather than religion.](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/294u1d/arrest_over_car_boot_full_of_voting_forms/).

&gt;Which group represents 2/3 of all genetic abnormalities in the UK because of first cousin marriage? 

Again, this is cultural problem. Your wording of this implied that 2/3 of the group suffers a serious defect which isn't always true. 

&gt;Which group tops the charts for forced marriage? 

That's not in Islam. In fact, Islam forbids it.

&gt;Which group forms the bulk of so-called rape gang suspects who are convicted? 

That's not religion issue.

It seems to me that you have clear agenda in this case. You attribute most of problems to religion when in reality it's cultural problem. There's clear difference between culture and Islam.",0,1403978346,null,0,1403978949,0,cijfsky,t3_29bkf3,t1_cijfsky,t1_cijdwgo,null,1434446266,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

ensure that they comply
with the requirements of
the Distance Selling Regul
ations where applicable and
provide a 'cooling off'
period (see also Group 18(f)). The Dis
tance Selling Regulations will apply
when the landlord or agent is using
an organised distance sales scheme,
letting properties without any face-to-
face contact with the prospective
tenant,
29
for rental agreements for short
leases of under three years. On
occasion, contracts may be entered into
over the phone or by other means,
and similarly a short 'cooling off period'
must be allowed for the tenant to
read and get advice on the terms. This
helps achieve fairness since tenants
can pull out without loss of deposit or ot
her penalty if they find the agreement
is not what they expected. Not all
tenancy agreements have to be in writing,
but those that are for a fixed term of longer than three years do have to be
prepared as a deed. ](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/284440/oft356.pdf) (pdf pg 33)",0,1403979208,null,0,false,0,cijg4rh,t3_29bj2a,t1_cijg4rh,t1_cijcx7l,null,1434446539,3,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,3

Nah not well at all! First it took six months for a referral which I thought was a bit much. Then I had an appointment sent through, which turned out to r an open surgery session with the gyno. I waited three hours in a waiting area with no seats, and then went in to see the guy, who told me that, at 21, I was too young to have any serious issues (i was worried about endometriosis which runs in the family) and that, seeing as I am newly married, I should have kids now and then that might help my pain. Literally a two minute appointment where I just got brushed off.

Also, personal motivations didn't always turn out so well under Davies. [Rose:](#s ""Her romantic relationship with the Doctor got really old really fast, and her smugness/pettiness was nigh unbearable at times(read:Love and Monsters)"")

[Martha:](#s ""Despite the Doc blatantly treating her like a substitute for Rose, she inexplicably maintains her devotion to him, and instead of her growing out of that role, not only does she declare her love for him, but at some points, most notably with that fire and ice and rage monologue, that infatuation starts to border on straight up worship."")

[Donna:](#s ""Most consider Donna to be the best supporting character in the Davies era, and I mostly agree that she was the most interesting companion and really developed the most. However, this all gets largely undermined when she gets hit with a reset button at the end of S4, because for some reason in a show centered around change status quo is still god."")

[Amy:](#s ""Amy initially felt a lot like another Rose, and a lot of the selfishness Rose exhibits, Amy mirrors in S5. The difference is that the show actually addresses the consequences of her running away from her friends and family, instead of acknowledging it then sweeping it under the rug. Her S7 character felt a bit flimsy at times(the divorce subplot was particularly stupid), but she got a bridge dropped on her halfway through the season, so she didn't overstay her welcome by too big a margin."")

[Rory:](#s ""I should also add that, in my opinion, part of the reason Amy worked was because she brought Rory along with her. This accomplished two things: it allowed the show to establish fairly definitively that she wasn't going to be the Doctor's love interest, and it allowed her to go on adventures without creating another Rose/Mickey situation."")

[Clara:](#s ""Clara is a weird character. I'm going to throw that out there right off the bat. Her character is initially an incomprehensible mystery, and for that reason I agree that she got very little development in S7. That being said, the entire Impossible Girl arc was an excellent set up for her development in the Doctor's idiosyncratic trilogy. Once it's established just how deep her involvement in the Doctor's history is, she becomes more of an old friend to the Doctor, second guessing him on his decision to destroy Gallifrey and taking the initiative to act as his advocate to the Time Lords. She certainly comes off as emotionally restrained around the Doctor, but that's because she's savvy to his manipulative tendencies. That in my mind rationalizes their decision to hold off on the heavier character moments until after 11's departure."")",0,1403982661,null,0,false,0,cijhhy9,t3_299ivf,t1_cijhhy9,t1_ciivpq3,null,1434447143,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

I've had two, so far.  By the time I had the first one (last October, at age 32) things had progressed pretty far and I would have benefited greatly from diagnosis and treatment *much* sooner.  The first laparoscopy was just to look around and hopefully diagnose me, which they did.  Endometriosis, adenomyosis, uterine fibroids, ovarian and Fallopian cysts, endometrial polyps, and adhesions on my bowel, bladder, uterus, ovaries, Fallopian tubes, and stomach.  

The second lap was kind of an emergency treatment as well as to see how things were progressing (not very well).  They did an ablation to burn off as much endometrial tissue as possible and removed some of the cysts and fibroids.

I'm stilling seeing the gynae and we're trying to figure out how to proceed.  They want to do another laparoscopy in 6-8 months and also a cystoscopy because my bladder is being annoying and they aren't sure if it's just because of the adhesions or something else too.  Treatment-wise, I have the alverine for the bowel stuff and also for uterine spasms, mirabegron (for the bladder!), a Mirena IUS to try to control some of the endometriosis and adenomyosis and cysts, gamolenic acid which is just fancy prescription high-dose evening primrose oil because it's supposed to be good for hormonal stuff, iron and B12 supplements for the resulting anaemia, and buprenorphine patches for the pain. When cysts burst they tend to prescribe the strong cocodamol tablets.  It's looking as though I'll end up with a hysterectomy at some point in the near future though, which I'm okay with.

Average at best?

Grand old team to play for        
Grand old team to support      
And if you know your history, it's enough to make you heart go Ooo Ooo Ooo Ooo

---

If you want an easy ride, don't support Everton. We are a big club, but in the smallest of ways- but we are like a big frustrated family. We are owned by a local lad and die hard supporter, he might be a shit businessman, but everything he has ever done has been what he thought would benefit the club; and that is amazingly rare in football nowadays. 

We play a beautiful brand of football though, and have an exciting future ahead when our gaffer (the man with the most soothing voice in football) really begins to put his vision together. That is a vision that is focused around playing good football with players developed by the club.

Our history goes way back, and we have a ton of 'firsts' and 'oldest' (there is a link somewhere), including the first purpose built football stadium, where we still play today (albeit, slightly improved since then). Even though there are tens of thousands of people through the turnstiles each week, Goodison maintains an amazing small community feel.

I know it is an advert for a bank, and a cunty one at that- but [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cgi6ysw-Ltk) is a great representation of Everton. The old bloke is Billy Ingram, 88 year old lifelong blue who still holds a season ticket, and even after 70+ years. [Here is a bit of backstory](http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/tv-star-billy-blue-hails-5759882).

For me, that is what Everton is about. Not the players on the pitch or the trophies in the cabinets- but the people. You don't have to be a local, or even have been to a game to be an Everton person, just cheer when we win, wear your shirt with pride, chant songs in whatever bar you watch the games in, and if we ever meet- be really bloody opinionated about the team. 

Everton are my community, and Evertonians are the group I know I can be accepted within. I was never brought up with religion, as with many in the North West- so sport (and Everton in particular) is what covers that part of my life. Supporting Everton is a life decision, but one I feel people won't regret. ",0,1403985082,null,0,false,0,cijieo4,t3_29bs6z,t1_cijieo4,t3_29bs6z,null,1435487095,25,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,25

I think it's a fantastic city with a ton of culture, the summer events are to die for, and there's SO MUCH to see and do here.  But.....I'm getting sick of the yoyoing every time we have an election.  Every few years the separatists get wound up and pissed and vote in the Parti Quebecois, which never ends well.  They moan on and on about French and Quebec as a country, but never do anything about our shite education system and healthcare and economy.  As soon as there's talk about separation, tensions rise.  Companies are hesitant to invest, which doesn't help the economy, and English Quebecers get their panties in a twist (me included) and say ""Fuck this, I'm moving to Ontario"".  The thing is, the Rest of Canada (ROC) doesn't like Quebecers, even the English ones.  So we're not really accepted in our own province and we're not really accepted in the ROC.  I have to fight to get service in English in a lot of hospitals or clinics.  The cops here actually have the legal right to refuse to speak English, even though it's one of Canada's official languages.  There are LAWS about what language you can speak in the workplace.  It feels stifling sometimes.

My dad (Scottish) died 4 years ago.  He was the only member of his family to move here, so the rest of them are still over in Scotland.  I've got cousins and aunts and uncles all over the place.  In Canada....I have my mom, my two asshole brothers who I have nothing in common with, and a niece who moved 3 hours away.  She's busy with her 3 year old and we can never seem to get together to do anything.  I'd be leaving behind a few friends, but I actually have more friends in the UK than I do here.  

I miss my Scottish family.  We have a lot in common and actually talk fairly regularly, whereas I have nothing in common with the family members I have here.  When my dad was alive, it was fine, right, because I had him.  But now that's he gone, I feel a bit....lost?  Not hearing the accent every day bothers me.  Not speaking to someone who shares my weird expressions bothers me.  Dunno, it just feels as though 'the homeland' is calling me, so to speak.  I've been getting more and more frustrated with Quebec as each year goes by, and every single time I go visit Scotland and then come back home, I feel like my heart is breaking.  So I figure....well, fuck it.  I miss my family and friends.  I miss the culture.  I miss easy access to Irn Bru and Jaffas.  I miss the accents and weird phrases.  So, UK here I come.  If I don't at least try, I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

Even where you would expect there to be commonality because a matter has been adjudicated on at the European level you still get differences between England and Scotland. 

For example, IIRC courts in Scotland take the view that the drawing of inferences of guilt by someone exercising their right to silence is a violation of the right to silence which is probably more in-keeping with how the European Court of Human Rights tends to adjudicate such matters than the English attitude that inferences of guilt can be drawn by exercising the right to silence...

Until relatively recently you had no right to consult with a lawyer if detained in police custody in Scotland whereas you almost always did in England. However, since the European courts ruled on the matter in Cadder the courts in Scotland have been taking a staggeringly strict and brutalist approach to the right to a fair trial. 

Recently a guy had his conviction overturned on appeal because although he had initially waived his right to consult a lawyer he changed his mind part way through being interviewed and decided he wanted to consult with a lawyer.

Why is that? What makes home field that much more of an advantage for this team versus another? Like, for American football I am a Green Bay Packers fan, so the weather and sellout crowds of nothing but Packers fans creates a huge advantage for the Packers. Is it something similar for Everton?

The fans are a huge factor, we have a pretty big, very loud and very old stadium that is very, very close to the pitch. [If you see here](http://cache2.asset-cache.net/gc/479058323-leighton-baines-of-everton-takes-a-corner-gettyimages.jpg?v=1&amp;c=IWSAsset&amp;k=2&amp;d=X7WJLa88Cweo9HktRLaNXuZ%2B%2BfS%2B4JTd7cEjm00DHAjIlwobV3i%2BKsvd4bMRzkXF) the fans are right on top of the players, and can hear every horrible things said to them by our fans.

It is very intimidating for a side to come here, and there are players who crack under the pressure. Yes, some thrive under it... But we just need to know who they are so the players can compensate. Our lads also lift their game, because everytime they touch the ball there is a cheer, and if the play is lacking energy we will try and boost them (usually by starting a big song or chant), and it works pretty well!

The loud, close fans also intimidate the referees. There was a very well designed study from Germany some years ago that said teams with louder, or closer fans have a subconscious effect on the refs decision making- and Goodison ticks both those boxes. 

Additionally, once more- we play a very quick passing based style of football where we move the ball around the pitch far more than other teams. Because football pitches are not a standard size (they have to fit within certain minimum and maximum thresholds), our players can manipulate space and develop play far better than the opposition, who are used to playing on a different sized pitch. 

If you look at last season; we won 13 games at home, and only 8 away- scoring 38 and home and 22 away. If truth be known, we should have been better away (6 draws during the season, which is fr too many), but we are all hoping it is something that can be worked on this season.",0,1403986240,null,0,false,0,cijiulq,t3_29a99h,t1_cijiulq,t1_cijhts0,null,1434447750,3,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,3

I must apologise for incorrectly referring to the path as the ‘cycle path’. You are correct, it is the railway path. That is the only thing I will apologise for though.

I am a paying supporter of Sustrans and thank you for helping to keep the path in pleasant condition for everyone that uses it. It’s a shame that some people (closer to the Bristol end) are sometimes using it as a dumping site for their old furniture.

As a user of the path for both cycling and walking I see a lot of the fantastically positive side of having such a brilliant, safe, path to use every day. However, on the odd occasion, there are complete cunts that use it. These people are who my original post is directed at. 

Sure, most people I encounter are very friendly people. I give them plenty of space when I pass them, they smile, they continue on their way. There are very, very, few that are the complete opposite. These people however don’t seem to care that anyone else is even using the path, they walk their dog with the lead stretching across the path, or they walk/run in the middle of the path, or they cycle in groups 3-abreast causing you to squeeze past them even after ringing a bell or saying ‘excuse me’ several times. These people are the annoying ones. These are the people who don’t realise just how lucky they are to have the path in the first place. These people are the selfish ones.

You seem to think I’m against smiling and forgiving, this is not true at all. I can usually tell the difference between when somebody who made a genuine mistake and when they are just being arseholes or just bloody ignorant. Everyone can make mistakes, even me, and my immediate reaction is as if they’d made a mistake.

true,itz4mna,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"&gt; I just mean physically as in the same species, really culturally every community is different from a country down to a village. 

I disagree, there are factors that define a community as a nation in a distinct way to other communities like villages or counties.

&gt;When it comes to the bigger more major things like global climate change and globalisation I think working together is going to lead to a better outcome for Europe than if we all work individually. Having human rights legislation that is the same all across Europe makes sense too. We don't all need to speak English and drink tea but we can all work together on the things that impact us all.

There are many of us who don't particularly care about the politics or outcomes of Europe. As long as British interests aren't harmed it's none of our business to play a role in the politics of other countries. We're not a rich, globe spanning empire any more and the resources we do have should be solely for the use of British citizens. We will adapt to climate change and globalisation regardless of our position in Europe and I'd rather these adaptations don't involve sacrificing British self determination.

&gt;Kind of like councils and the government work together now, councils deal local and governments deal nationally, a european parliament could just be the next step up from that, tackling the things that impact everyone in that community.

The councils are subordinate to the government and it would be a travesty of democracy for Britain to be subordinate to a government that consists of people who are not British citizens and have never set foot on British soil. There is no such thing as a ""European community"", there are 28 very different countries with different aims and ideas all trying to further their interests. For some countries it is in their interests to have closer integration but for others it would be disastrous. The harder the EU tries to integrate the more it pushes otherwise ordinary people towards the far right. People simply don't want to give up their nationality to become a protectorate.

true,imbingteria,null,null,"*Within* each country one can find almost as much diversity as randomly selected groups between two countries.  I suppose it's about applying the ""right"" legislation at each level.  

Personally, I think there can be more Eu wide unification, and also more region, or county-wide ""localism"" at the same time.  It just depends what you want each level of bureaucracy to be dealing with.  So, for example, things like pub licensing hours should, IMHO, be left to the town to decide.  At the same time, it makes no sense for a town to cut carbon emissions if the rest of the world doesn't*, so (again IMHO) the Eu needs to preside over the legislation for these sorts of issues.

As Westminster looses power over issues which it makes sense to make as large an impact as possible, it's going to fight for it's relevance.  The big stuff has to be handled on a Eu wide basis - even things like foreign policy - where a group of countries acting together has more power.  We need ""that kind"" of power to deal with the issues the *world* is facing.  We need local power to deal with the issues that towns are facing, or county-wide power to deal with county-wide issues.  Etc etc.  I think the ""new"" world means Westminster has to give up a lot of power, and I don't think that the kinds of people in charge at that level are happy with that.

Power transitions are probably an interesting phenomenon for historians, as the events and situations that lead to or result in power transitions are often quite dramatic.  Eg monarch -&gt; parliament in Britain around the civil war, the American war of independence, even changing governments every time there is an election is relatively dramatic.

Back in the day he'd score about 10-12 of those long range goals a season...now he's older and changed his position and moved a bit further back because it doesn't require as much running around. Nowadays he'll maybe score 2 of those a season. I miss the old Gerrard but the new one in his deeper position is just as great, he just focuses on different things. He makes 60 yard passes with ease, instead of back in the day when he was further forward and he'd receive those sorts of passes.

Other players you should look up (I've included YouTube clips) are ones like:

* [Kenny Dalglish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP1QEXutRaM) -- (1977-1991. Player-manager from 1985-87. Manager 1987-1991 and 2011-2012). Him and Gerrard are the best players to have ever played for the club. 172 goals in 515 appearances. Nickname 'King Kenny' - From Glasgow, Scotland

* [Robbie Fowler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaIzXqBCcaQ) -- (1993-2001 and 2006-2007) Fastest Premier League hattrick in history. Nickname 'God'. 183 goals in 369 appearances. - From Toxteth (Liverpool)

* [Ian Rush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQpT5V6hKG8) -- (1981-1987 and 1988-1996). Highest goalscorer in LFC history. Spent one year (1987-88 season) playing for Juventus in Italy before returning to Liverpool. 346 goals in 600 appearances. From St. Asaph, Wales.

* [Ian Callaghan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT8b7Jg3-os) -- (1960-1978). Record number of appearances for Liverpool (857). 68 goals.

* [Steve McManaman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFc9frXRAHg) -- (1990-1999) Nickname 'Macca'. You may recognise him from ESPN's coverage of the World Cup this summer.

There are **sooooo** many others you can check out in your own time. Some are all-time legends who arguably I should have written more about but I could be here all day if I did that. Others definitely worthy of mention are:

John Barnes, Peter Beardsley, Phil Neal, Mark Lawrenson, Alan Hansen, David Fairclough, Xabi Alonso, Luis Garcia, Didi Hamann, Sami Hyypia, Jamie Carragher, Pepe Reina, Jerzy Dudek, Steve Heighway, John Toshack, Ron Yeats, Phil Thompson...I could go on for days. Undoubtedly I'm going to get lots of replies saying I've forgotten someone.

And some legendary coaches and managers:

[An Epic Swindle](http://www.amazon.com/An-Epic-Swindle-Months-Cowboys/dp/085738600X) is one of the best books I've ever read. It's about our previous owners before John Henry bought us. Our previous owners were these two other Americans (their names fill me with so much hate and disgust I can't mention them) who dragged this club from literally the top of the world to the brink of bankruptcy in less than 4 years. We were arguably the best club side in the world between 2005-2007, along with the likes of Barcelona and AC Milan. Four years later, we were facing relegation from the Premier League. The book documents their time in charge and all the drama and bullshit that happened as the club struggled to survive their clutches. Court battles, restraining orders, arguments, lies, broken promises. It covers it all. Honestly, an amazing book.

I'll cut the crap and be more frank: You will most likely meet a lot of people who will call you a bandwaggoner, for supporting our team after a great season. Then you will meet some people who will bash you for your lack of football knowledge. Then there's the very few, who will say it's weird that you support a club outside your country.


You will also meet people who will welcome you into our beloved club and happily share their joys (and, more likely, frustration) that this wonderful club can give you.


Don't be a fan the way people tell you to, but do it at your own pace. I will not expect you to fall in love with this club instantly, and feel the way I do. But be warned: This club WILL grow on you, and you WILL fall in love, and you WILL tear your hair to pieces because, and I'll be honest here, sometimes the team sure likes to give us all some heart attacks.

Some people *need* a reason to follow a team. Some people will want to know why and how *you* became a supporter. Does it matter? No. Why did some guy start hitting on a girl and then started dating her? No idea. My point is, it doesn't really matter and you can't choose who you fall in love with. I fell in love with this club and I am certain that you will too, because it's a beautiful thing.


A lot of guys have already given you tips on what to watch. Some things you should definitely know about:


* The players Kenny Dalglish and Robbie Fowler (edit: and obviously Jamie Carragher and Steven Gerrard).

* The years 1976-1989, where Liverpool pretty much dominated the Football League First Division (before it became the Premier League).

* Hillsborough disaster.

* Champions League 2005 campaign.

* Season 08/09 and 13/14.

* Rivalry with Manchester United.

* Rivalry with Everton.

* Meeting Chelsea in semi-finals and other important games where they seem to just want to ruin football.

* [You'll Never Walk Alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV5_LQArLa0) by Gerry &amp; The Pacemakers and the [reason](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You'll_Never_Walk_Alone#Sporting_anthem) for this.


Be warned though: If you watch football games from before the 90's, you might get a bit dissapointed. The games were not near the level it is today, and the video quality is quite potatoe.

Besides this you should educate your self on football (you can call it soccer if you want).

Learn how football is played, especially with the [4-3-3 formation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXWq34XByjc). It's not just about getting it up field and putting it in the net. It's a fluid game, where everyone attacks, and everyone defends. Some years ago, teams started [marking zonally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtIAhX5xhLs) instead of man to man (Benitez brought this to our game). It also used to be much more about either attacking or defending, for a player individually, while [today even the forwards need to defend](http://performance.fourfourtwo.com/tactics/peter-taylor-defending-for-wingers).


I really hope you'll come to appreciate this game just as much as I do, and that you will take part in the roller coaster ride that is Liverpool FC!


From the latest season, I would really advice you to look up and watch these games:

* Liverpool - Stoke (First match of the season. Mignolet with a clutch save)

* Everton - Liverpool (Intense derby!)

* Tottenham Hotspurs - Liverpool (Some of the best football Liverpool played...)

* Liverpool - Arsenal (...or at least so we thought! The first 20 minutes of this game will be one of the most dominating performances you will ever watch, guaranteed!)

* Stoke City - Liverpool (This game really shows our strengths and weaknesses)

* Fulham - Liverpool (Heart attacks galore)

* Cardiff City - Liverpool (Ups and downs. Insane game)

* Liverpool - Manchester City (We all thought we had the season in our hands after this one)

* Crystal Palace - Liverpool (Just watch it. If you have watched the 2005 CL Final, this hurts even more)

If you are curious about football, you can always visit /r/soccer (but that's pretty much the worst sub on reddit) or even /r/bootroom (a sub dedicated to football players, coaches etc., about playing the game).",0,1403992930,null,0,1403994037,0,cijles4,t3_29chjs,t1_cijles4,t3_29chjs,null,1434448833,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

&gt;

&gt;In the United Kingdom, the song's most successful [cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version) was released by [Gerry and the Pacemakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerry_and_the_Pacemakers) in 1963, after the band's producer [George Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Martin) suggested that they record it as a follow up to their hit ""I Like It,"" peaking at number one in the singles chart for four consecutive weeks.

&gt;The song quickly became the anthem of [Liverpool Football Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.) and is invariably sung by its supporters moments before the start of each home game.  The words ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" also feature in the club crest and on the Shankly Gate entrance to [Anfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield), their home stadium.

&gt;According to former player [Tommy Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Smith_(footballer_born_1945\)), lead vocalist [Gerry Marsden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerry_Marsden) presented Liverpool manager [Bill Shankly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shankly) with a recording of his forthcoming cover single during a pre-season coach trip in the summer of 1963. ""Shanks was in awe of what he heard. ... Football writers from the local newspapers were travelling with our party and, thirsty for a story of any kind between games, filed copy back to their editors to the effect that we had adopted Gerry Marsden's forthcoming single as the club song.""  Shankly later picked the song as his eighth and final selection for *[Desert Island Discs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_Island_Discs)* on the eve of the [1965 FA Cup Final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1965_FA_Cup_Final).

true,KopiteKing13,lfcflame,,"Yeah, I'm relatively familiar with American sports because I live here, although I'll admit I don't understand quite how it works. I love football (American Football) but not so much a baseball fan...probably because I live in Houston and no one cares about the Astros here these days :/

As far as selling Suarez goes, before the bite he was probably worth about £90-100m, which would be a world record fee for a player (£86m for Gareth Bale from Tottenham to Real Madrid last year).

Now that he's banned for the first 3 months of the season, his value's probably dropped a bit, although it's impossible to say how much. I'd be shocked and saddened if we sold him for less than £75m (or £45-50m plus Sanchez from Barcelona).

With that money, Liverpool would probably reinvest it in some big names. It's been a while since we went all out and bought a massive superstar. Suarez became a superstar during his time here, but he wasn't anything **too** special when we bought him. Same with Sturridge, he was an under-utilised but talented gamble when we bought him from Chelsea. We saw his potential and bought him for £12m (pretty cheap considering his talent).

The reason Liverpool didn't win the league this past season is because we ran out of gas at the end. We had a tiny squad compared to the other teams around us (City, Chelsea, Arsenal, etc) and we basically relied on the same 13 players for the entire season. We played out of our skins, I've never seen us play so good, but we made so many stupid errors that cost us in the very end as well. We're the only team to ever score &gt; 90 goals in a season and not win the league. We scored 101 and still didn't win. Typical. Manchester City have a massive squad full of world class players. When one gets injured, they have a world class player ready to step in. When we got an injury, we had unproven teenagers step in. We need to bring in 2 or 3 huge names this summer to step into the first team and provide competition for the guys already here. Some of our players have no real competition (Glen Johnson) and so they just coast through knowing that they'll never be dropped, because there's no one else to step in their place.

In terms of draft picks or the like, we don't have that in football (soccer). There's no collegiate football system, so promising players are signed to Youth contracts as kids (like 9 or 10 yrs old) and they play football for club's youth teams throughout the rest of their childhood. Some make it, most don't, and are released to either go find another path to pursue or they get picked up by another club for their academy.

When switching teams, players get bought and sold, rather than traded. A club will set a price for a player and other clubs will bid for him. If a bid matches the club's valuation, they'll accept the bid and allow the buying club to approach the player to discuss a contract. In the last few years, transfer values have skyrocketed due to the globalisation of football and all the money that swirls around the game now. When I was a kid, Alan Shearer's move from Blackburn to Newcastle set a world record at the time at £15m in 1996. It went up again in subsequent years a couple of times and then in 2000 the transfer record was smashed as Zinedine Zidane went from Juventus in Italy to Real Madrid for £48m. That record remained intact until 2009 when Kaka went to Real Madrid from AC Milan for £56m. A week later, Real Madrid beat the record **again** by signing Cristiano Ronaldo from Man United for £80m. Last year, they set the record again for buying Gareth Bale for £86m. Suarez is worth more than that, although this latest bite probably means we wouldn't get that.

But back to my original point, it's about time Liverpool went out and got some world class players. I'd like Suarez to be sold for £50m plus Alexis Sanchez. With the £50m, we could also address our other needs in the squad (left-back, right-back, left-winger, etc). However, putting some of that money towards youth infrastructure is always welcome too. We already have one of the country's best youth academies and are producing some great young talent, so I'm excited to see their development over the next few years too.",0,1403993329,null,0,false,0,cijljue,t3_29cbr7,t1_cijljue,t1_cijl2pp,null,1434448904,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

As far as football movies go, ESPN did a great [30 For 30 documentary back in April about Hillsborough](http://www.disclose.tv/action/viewvideo/172435/Hillsborough__30_for_30_Soccer_Stories__ESPN_Films/).

The Damned United is a great film, in fact I just watched it again about 3 weeks ago. Unfortunately, like most movies, facts were changed so much that it's almost nothing like what actually happened. I mean, the general gist of it was right, but the movie moved games around to make a sexier story, instead of just telling it how it is. Still though, it's based on a book anyway, so it's part-reality part-fictionalised. Fantastic film in and of itself though.

&gt;The main reason why there was high unemployment for Somalis because most of Somalis arrived here in the UK recently. **Do you really expect Somalis to learn language, culture, etc and get job at same time instant they arrive in the UK?** That's not possible. Most of them will need go to some adult college to learn language and get some qualification to get a skilled job, and it's significantly harder for them to get job due to huge gap in their CVs.


I think that is a fair requirement really. If they can't speak the language and understand the culture, then that is a problem for them and for us. If they can't get a job, then they rely on the benefit system which is already complained about without extra numbers using it. 

There should be a stricter system for people to come here that plan on settling in the UK. It's just creating a climate for a drain on resources that we really don't need. And I'm not singling out a particular group of people here at all.

At what point (irrespective of who it is and where they're from) do we say that too many is problematic? What you also have to consider is - even if the numbers aren't concerning to you is that the integration is not as good as it should be. That's not all down to people that come here but it creates unnecessary tension whether it's warranted or not in the local communities.

There should be a system where cases for citizenship are based on a system of contribution. Does the person have a profession we are in need of? Do they have money to sustain their life without employment? Can they be comfortably housed without straining housing? Can they converse with English people so not to create difficulties for all parties? Do they understand the cultural differences and understand that some practices are not excepted here? Can they integrate into the UK without causing any fuss?

All those things should be asked when someone wants to live here for the rest of their life or it will not work out for anyone.",1,1403994071,null,0,false,0,cijltas,t3_29bkf3,t1_cijltas,t1_cijfsky,null,1434449113,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

They traded their stars for prospects and are signing their prospects to long, low-cost contracts instead of letting them go through arbitration. While the risk is paying $20 mill over 7 years to someone who doesn't pan out, the reward is having a Mike Trout caliber player at low costs, instead of the $20mill/year or so that Trout just got.
