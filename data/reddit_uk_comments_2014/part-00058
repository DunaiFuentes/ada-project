true,bluescrn,null,null,"It's not about encouraging/discouraging driving. The choice for many, especially in rural areas (which public transport will never serve effectively), is between driving and unemployment.

It's not possible for *everyone* to live in the city centres - where public transport kind-of-works, leaving the countryside purely for weekends/tourism...

Cycling is not a solution. It might be a good thing, but will only ever be viable for a few percent.  Many commutes are far too long - and that's only going to get worse with a weak job market, no job security, and pumped-up property prices. Living near work is a luxury that many can't afford.  And most people won't cycle because the weather here is shit. And you can't really cycle in a suit. And it doesn't work for older/less healty workers. And there's rarely anywhere to store bikes. But mostly, because the weather is so bad...  No, cycling is not a replacement for the car.

Trains are good. But if you're opposed to road building, I'm sure you'd be even more opposed to lots of new high-speed railway lines being built? But HS2 is enough to prove that we're not capable of such big infrastructure projects (spanning multiple governments, all thinking super-short-term) any more. It's unlikely that railways will ever be significantly expanded, isn't it?

true,SagaAriana,null,null,"The reason I was not 100% sure about Clara's plot was that when she went into the Doctor's time stream, she saved the Doctor on so many occasions even in the classic series where it had originally been assumed that he solved the problems himself. To say that she perhaps got him out of tough spots without him realizing in a few crucial moments is one thing, but they claimed she even is the reason he bought the TARDIS and started his adventures. For me, it's not about the character as much about how the writers used her to change 50 years of a show's history to fill their desire for the ""biggest twist in the show's history."" Also, I've seen arguments that don't like how the Doctor specifically states there's a one in some impossible chance that he would not be able to return after entering his own time stream and yet he's able to save her and get back out pretty easily.

To be honest, I do like Clara as a character most of the time. Though I agree with some folks that perhaps I like particular iterations of her like Dalek Oswin more than modern-day Clara. I also feel that on rare occasion they try to push her ""spunky-ness"" too far. For example, ""It's smaller on the outside."" From their relationship I wanted Ten and Donna, but I'm not sure they created the same sibling-like rapport. I'm most curious to see her and Capaldi interact.

As a grown adult, cbeebies is not worth the license fee.

true,iomex,eng-devon,Devon,"I would say look at Exeter Airport first - you'll need a local bus or a taxi to Exeter centre to catch a National Express which can get you as far as Totnes (rail replacement coaches will do the same job). From there, there's local buses to Dartmouth (Stagecoach Gold, every 20 minutes), or a taxi (not sure how expensive Totnes taxis are).

If you can only get to Bristol Airport (it's more expensive than Exeter sometimes), National Express can get you to either Totnes (if you're staying in Dartmouth, bus/taxi connection required), or to Paignton.

The problem is that if you can't find a hotel in Dartmouth, your next hotel is the Seven Stars in Totnes which is small and probably not cheap. The next urban area from Dartmouth is Torbay. There's a Travelodge on the Torbay ring road in Paignton (not to be confused with their seafront hotel). It's not actually that far from Dartmouth - 5-10 minutes to Kingswear by car (and then across the river on the ferry). However, without a car it's a bit tricky. 

If you don't have access to a car, save yourself a bus transfer and stay on Paignton sea front - there are loads of cheap hotels there, within easy walking distance of the bus station where there is a line to Kingswear (where you can cross over to Dartmouth on the ferry), or a Stagecoach Gold service to Dartmouth (but goes through Totnes so takes longer).

EDIT: I mentioned rail replacement as Dawlish Sea Wall is out. The rail line is due to be open before July, but don't bet on it. Coaches are available to replace trains between Exeter and Plymouth, and there is also a rail replacement operating between Bristol and Plymouth (may or may not stop at Totnes and Newton Abbot).

There is a Travelodge on Paignton Sea Front, its walking distance to the bus station, but there are numerous other hotels along there (Esplanade Hotel is part of a decent chain), along with various B+B's. 

For food, Paignton is good. Paignton is basically a family weekend break type of place. Loads of pub-restaurants, cafes, etc. 

Don't rely on cheap food in Dartmouth. There's a nice seafood restaurant called Sails: https://goo.gl/maps/Vw0pG if you're so inclined. Not too pricey, either, but was a little while ago since I ate there.

Another edit: If you ever need a taxi here, your two numbers are 01803 211611 (large private hire firm), or 01803 444444. Most of the taxi firms are based in Torquay, so in Paignton those are your two numbers. Have worked for 444444 in the past, they're a decent smallish company, they run on Standard Hackney rate which is similar to 211611. I have no idea about taxis in Totnes or Dartmouth.

I've rented a car from Friday to Monday (Vauxhall Insignia) for 77 quid from Enterprise in Torquay. It might be cheaper and more convenient overall if they have an outlet at Bristol Airport to do that.

As for trains, thanks to Dr Beeching there haven't been any local train routes here for decades. Bicycles are also very nice in flat terrain but are very impractical in hills, or where your place of work is more than a few miles away.

To cap it all off, with a car I can come and go as I please. It is indeed cheap to run, but even my older car was still notably cheaper than a bus. Your car is never late, and it never drives off without you ten minutes early to save time. 

I'd love a viable system of public transport here, but the practicality of the matter is that cars are a much cheaper option out here. Everyone wants the best improvements possible with the minimum amount of investment, and here as a matter of simple pragmatism that means roads. Unless some landmark deal provides cheap, reliable, regular buses that aren't going to jack up fares to match the subsidy is struck, I'll stick with the most eminently practical travel arrangement possible; my car.",0,1393525256,null,0,false,0,cfq86oc,t3_1z0okj,t1_cfq86oc,t1_cfq5iol,null,1432586053,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;This listing was NOT put up by her. She‚Äôs had an account for a while, so it‚Äôs not an ‚Äòaccidental sign up problem‚Äô. She doesn‚Äôt have any rights over the page, there‚Äôs no means for us to take down the information without waiting for TripAdvisor to get back via support ticket.

&gt;We‚Äôve even researched the process to sign up an attraction, which is incredibly long and arduous and is vetted by the site themselves. Thus the listing is either a massive glitch by TripAdvisor (and thus a breach of the UK Data Protection Act 1998 as it actually lists our address) or has been done maliciously.

He eventually told his parents and they took him to a therapist who drugged him up. He'd be off and on the pills and his posts/mood would vary depending upon that.

true,JackXDark,null,null,"You're going to have to take this as hearsay and potential bullshit or tinfoil hattery, but there's a chance that PIE was always about trolling and causing a fuss rather than being a serious organisation.

One of the people that was rumoured to be involved in the US version of PIE, NAMBLA was 'Hakim Bey', which was a collective pseudonym for anarchist writers, but largely used by a guy called Peter Lamborn Wilson.

In the UK, back in the 70s and 80s you also have various fringe occult groups that wanted to be notorious and to have a reputation for being dangerous and edgy. One of these, which possibly never even existed as a real organisation, was the 'Order of the Nine Angles'. This is one of the very few groups claiming to be satanic that actually advocated literal human sacrifice in its writings, namely in a ritual called 'A Gift for the Prince'.

The Order of the Nine Angles pretty much only existed as one bloke, who published pamphlets and writings that were pretty mental. He was also linked with the National Front and I believe also the BNP later, but it's hard to believe he was doing anything but extreme trolling. Serious, proper hard trolling though, by claiming human sacrifices were occurring and the ONA was an actual real thing, and linking it with the NF. I think that the NF actually chucked him out. Which takes work.

Anyway, it's *possible and rumoured* and no, I'm not going to cite sources so take it with as many bags of salt as you like, that he used used Hakim Bey and NAMBLA as a model for more extreme trolling/hoaxing and went so far as to set up, or at least become involved in, PIE and also took that as far as he could within contemporary legal bounds.

Allegedly now, this individual has converted to Islam and grown a big beard and writes anti-western inflammatory rhetoric and tries to get Muslims to go along with it, as he regards this as the most anti-establishment position to take.

TLDR - PIE was a hoax, inspired by NAMBLA, by a bloke that once claimed to be a satanist doing human sacrifices, who's now pretending to be an Imam. Maybe.",1,1393528146,null,0,false,0,cfq9mef,t3_1z3f2o,t1_cfq9mef,t3_1z3f2o,null,1432586730,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,Mynameisaw,yorkshire,West Yorkshire,"&gt;In computer science authorization is the process of qualifying if a given user should be allowed to complete the operation they've requested to perform (not to be confused with authentication which is verifying if a person IS who they claim to be). 

Except we're talking about law, not computer science.

In which case unauthorised means ""Without consent of the individual.""

&gt;But remember that the machine is functioning on their behalf.

No, it's not. The machine is operating a Service provided to the user by the Service Provider - for their sole use. 
&gt;This area of legality is going to pose a ton of problems in the future. If I can be prosecuted for setting up a machine that is torrenting a film then why am I not responsible if a server that is acting on my behalf authenticates the wrong user?

Because in Scenario A you set up the machine with the intent of breaking copyright law.

In Scenario B you didn't. 

It's very simple: The voicemail belongs to Person A. Person B accesses this without Person A authorising/allowing/agreeing. Person B has now broke the law for unauthorised access to a computer system. 

To use a real world example you can't confuse with Computer Science. 

Person A has a Pin protected locker. Person B guesses the Pin, Person B is still breaking the law.

true,bluescrn,null,null,"&gt; Doesn't that just show you than investment in public transport is needed?

Buses only work in heavily populated areas. On the main routes in and out of city centres, where there's a bus every 5-10 mins, they're effective. But in quiet villages, you might have a bus into town every couple of hours - might be OK for pensioners to have the occasional shopping trip, and make a day of it - but it just doesn't work for commuting.

If you ramp the buses up to, say, one every 20mins, you'll be running a huge fleet of mostly-empty buses, and it's likely that it'd be more efficient for people to go by car.

Trains require even higher population density around the stations - you're never going to get a station in every little village (and near every workplace). If you don't work in a big city, you're very unlikely to ever be commuting by train.

So what are the other options?

In an idea world, we'd massively reduce the need for commuting. But face it, that's not going to happen. Either working from home on a vast scale, or a massive reduction in days/hours worked. It ain't going to happen. The same with the transport of goods. The market is global. People won't go back to buying local on a large scale until the price of transporting goods makes it impractical.

And you certainly can't transport heavy goods long distances on a bike, or on foot. Should we go back to horse power?...

No, I can't see the car going away. As economic inequality continue to increase, the rich will just continue to price more and more of the poor off the road, as is already happening. But for the poor, public transport is hardly a cost-effective option either...  

And even if somebody had a wonderful solution for the transport problem, one thing is for sure, it'd be hijacked by greedy private interested before it was ever implemented...

There isn't a single thing that really is the difference. We would however be a much better team with a striker but in order to compete with those teams you listed we need more then just a striker. We need a complete defensive midfield overhaul, Mikel, Lamps, Ramires are not the same as Kroos, Schweinsteiger, Javi Martinez / Xavi, Iniesta, Busquets/ Modric, Khedira, Xabi Alonso... We also need a consistently good attacking midfielder, Oscar has been to on and off, with teams like Bayern, Barca, Madrid, they have players who always show up for the big occasions. Isco is always playing well, if he isnt Bale, Ronaldo, Di Maria would pick up the slack. Same with Bayern, Goetze isn't playing well? Well they have another world class midfielder in Thiago to take over. 

Matic and Hazard are the only two midfield players in the current lineup who I see as present big time players for us. The rest are either lacking something that makes them always deadly. Or they just have ""potential"", but unfortunately potential doesnt kill off games.

And before someone asks why I omitted Willian let me explain. As good as he has been for me he is still lacking the ""killer instinct"". He runs up and down, dribbles forward, looks hungry for the ball. But he really lacks a end product. He can run all he likes, but if he doesnt get the ball in the back of the net either with a goal or an assist you can't say he is playing well.

to think there is no difference or its a minor difference is completely insane. it makes all the difference, as a car crash is unintentional act resulting in death, so is collateral damage. there is no intention whatsoever to harm innocent civilians in any manner. unlike an agent who specifically wishes to target and hurt innocent civilians in order to use fear as a political tool.

I don't know how involved the school management is at this stage of the process, but I do know they are very busy at the moment finalising plans for the new building and temporary move so that may be holding up the decision process. 

As for the move, if you attended one of the open days back in September the CS department was in a building on the Malone Road (Bernard Crossland Building). As far as we are aware right now, starting over the summer the school will be moving to the Elmwood Building, which is directly behind the Student's Union and just before the School of Geography, while construction work happens in the Crossland Building. 

Quite a few people are getting rejected for the CS pathway, but accepted onto CIT or Software Engineering.

Also this one. Last year on my annual pilgrimage home, I was in Heathrow queuing up to go through security, there was a girl in front of me and in front of her were 4 elderly Americans (two couples). One of them started talking to the young girl (about 19), she said she was from Ireland. One of the elderly ladies said ""we visited Northern Ireland 8 years ago but we never made it to the south of Ireland."" To which the wee girl replied: ""I'm actually from the NORTH OF IRELAND, part of the ISLAND OF IRELAND"" (caps signify her emphasis).

I just wanted to punch her in the throat as well. If you want to make a political point, go ahead but there's a time and a place and a certain group of people you want to make that to. Americans in their early 70s are not them.

As I said, I think the US/UK are conducting themselves differently to people who would set off a truck bomb. That someone else's actions are worse doesn't make your actions good by default.

The ""hard decisions"" and ""tough calls"" are, IMO, similar to ""for security reasons"" in terms of meaningless terms of authority. They are used to justify a decision that has already been taken.

If you want to make a really hard decision, defeat radicals by rebuilding their country into a western democracy. Humans are the same kind if animal wherever they live. A country with the resources of the US could easily rebuild a society to value education and want prosperity and security.

Most people don't give a shit about their local radicals. They want food, shelter, and a safe life for their children. If you want to extinguish the 10% who hate you, turn the other 90% of their society against them.

Since when were there enough jobs in the UK to employ every single persons of working age and capability? Do you also think that everyone who is unemployed and struggling to live, have made a choice to not work?

While I do agree on one thing, people on minimum wage do no get enough money. we need to either raise min wage, or remove the taxes on people earning under a certain threshold.

I find that a uni can't really be over-rated. Your degree is worth what people think it's worth, and everyone thinks that LSE is a very good university, especially for the course you're going for. 

Also, a quick look on the accommodation website says:

&gt;As a first year undergraduate or General Course student, LSE guarantees you an offer of accommodation, as long as you apply before the deadline

[Third paragraph of this page.](http://www.lse.ac.uk/lifeAtLSE/accommodation/forStudents/home.aspx)

This said, you might want to give them an email on accommodation@lse.ac.uk - most unis from my experience are good at answering questions like this, they get them all the time. Also, more and more unis are getting rid of the restrictions on having local students move into halls - Bristol now don't discriminate based on postcode, something which changed the year I applied.

true,spartacusisaturtle,null,null,"‚ÄúIn the first half Norwich were nervous, Spurs dominated possession. You can‚Äôt dress that up any other way, though it was a fantastic three points for Norwich.‚Äù 

Mills felt the nervousness on the pitch was potentially caused by comments made two weeks ago by chief executive David McNally about the club‚Äôs current position. 

He added: ‚ÄúThe manager is on the precipice of being sacked and Mr McNally`s comments haven‚Äôt helped. If the boss gets told he will be sacked if he falls into the bottom three that should be kept out of the public and in house. 

‚ÄúWhen you look at some of the comments, I don‚Äôt understand how that will help the club.‚Äù 

On the subject of Norwich‚Äôs strikers, Mills added: ‚ÄúThe first half was a non event. Van Wolfswinkel has had four shots on target in 18 games, for a multi-million pound striker that is poor. If people think that‚Äôs harsh, it is a fact and it is not good enough. 

‚ÄúNorwich had plenty of chances and that has been their problem all season. They‚Äôve spent a lot of money and are probably disappointed.‚Äù 

Mills also defended manager Chris Hughton and feels there are other teams much worse than City in the league. He added: ‚ÄúI think he will keep them up but there is ridiculous pressure on him. They haven‚Äôt been in the relegation zone all season. There are three worse teams, actually there are four or five. 

‚ÄúHowever, if points aren‚Äôt picked up in the next couple they should be worried.‚Äù

It appears this was what he said - doesn't look like anything more than the standard MOTD comments we get every week haha. Hard to argue with him on most of the points if you ask me :/ reading the backlash he's had though it seems he may have gone into more detail than I could find slagging off our performance in the game itself.

true,TheMysteriousShadow,lfc68,,"I'd just like to point out first that I find it absolutely hilarious: it's Man United's turn to have some managerial problems for once. 

This whole topic, to me, boils down to two main points, which are semi-connected:

**David Moyes**. It's always going to be difficult for any successor after what Ferguson had done with United, but Moyes is increasingly looking like the very wrong man to have taken on the job; he appears over his head and clueless most of the time, and his refusal to change anything tactically is both flabbergasting and weird. It's been a season of ""Moyes needs more time"" so far, but there's only so much time professionals can be given before they're just labelled inept, and Moyes is edging closer every day. 

**Ferguson**. Ferguson was an incredible manager, as much as I hated him and his opinions. He understood the game, understood his players and, above all, understood the ""perfect time"": the perfect time to make a substitute, the perfect time to switch tactically, the perfect time to attack and the time to defend. He also understood the perfect time in which to retire, and leave a club full of underachievers and old players to a new manager: even good old Fergie must have been damn surprised that they won the League last year, with a sub-par team that has no real inspiration or leadership. 

Overall, it's a case of the wrong man with the wrong squad: Moyes has no experience in managing a side dismantling at the seams, and the players have no experience in feeling and playing as badly as this -- it's a vicious circle. Rooney and co. have always assumed that anything Man United touches turns to gold and, for the first time in the best part of 20 years, that just isn't true -- and they can't handle that. 

Of course, there are so many other factors -- the aforementioned players' ages, the injuries and the dip in form that all players experience -- but those are the main two, in my opinion. 

At this moment in time, I just can't see the Glazers allowing Moyes a ¬£150 million chest in the summer when he can't even beat a lacking Olympiakos side, so how Man United's fortunes are going to magically turn next season is beyond me.",0,1393537132,null,0,false,0,cfqe749,t3_1z48nw,t1_cfqe749,t3_1z48nw,null,1432588952,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

---

&gt;**An Island Parish** is a British television documentary made by [Tiger Aspect Productions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Aspect_Productions) for [BBC Two](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Two). Series 1 and 2 covered the lives of residents of the [Church of England](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England) parish of the [Isles of Scilly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isles_of_Scilly). These series were supported by the [Diocese of Truro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Truro).  They followed A Seaside Parish, which covered the work of the Reverend Christine Musser in the parish of [Boscastle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boscastle) in Cornwall, and also A Country Parish before that. Series 3 and 4 looked particularly at the work of the [Methodist Church](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodism) on the [Isles of Scilly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isles_of_Scilly), as seen through the eyes of the local minister, the Revd David Easton. Series 5 moved north and followed Fr John Paul in his first year as the [Roman Catholic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic) priest at [Castlebay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castlebay) on island of [Barra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barra), the second southernmost inhabited island in the [Outer Hebrides](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Hebrides) (after [Vatersay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatersay), to which it is linked by a causeway). Series 6 was filmed on Barra by Tiger Aspect Productions during 2011 and aired in early 2012, while series seven began in late 2012 and follows the Anglican priest and Methodist minister on [Sark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sark).

Which seemed unlikely, but now that Fer is injured perhaps Howson can slot straight back in to the team in his ideal position?

So, while I like Ten for his humanity, I completely understand that some others will be turned off because like you say he *is* an alien.  I like to think that was at least partly the Doctor rejecting the Time Lords because of the Time War. He was suffering some pretty severe post traumatic stress and embracing humanity was his way of coping.

It's funny that you bring up Capaldi's Doctor. He's the reason I'm a Whovian.  I've loved him as an actor for a long time and when it was announced that he was the new Doctor I started watching the new series on Netflix and quickly became a fan.  

Before that I'd only seen a few classic episodes here and there and the 1996 movie.  As a 13 year old it was the perfect introduction to the universe and Paul McGann became *my* Doctor, but I never bothered with the later series as they skipped straight over his Doctor and onto Christopher Eccelston.

One thing I have noticed with some members of the Tenth Doctor's fanbase is that they can be quite rabid and reject all other Doctors.  I'm not like that, and I hope that most Ten fans are also as open minded.  It's just that the small section of more loudly spoken fans ""TENNANT IS THE ONLY DOCTOR!"" make the most noise. 

So it's worth noting that even though I didn't like seasons five, six and seven as much as two to four, I did love Matt Smith's Doctor. And like I say I am extrememly excited to see what Peter Capaldi's Doctor brings to the show.

1.  Great win, showing some damn fight for once, but poor performance across the two legs.  Don't know how we're supposed to beat Benfica on this kind of form, but here's hoping they have a couple of off nights.

2.  Ade and Bobby struggled playing together in the first half, but looked better in the second.  If we're gonna try and get Soldado on the scoresheet, we have to play them together I think.  Adebayor's physicality helps him out, and even though they get in each other's way at times (Ade's first goal could easily have been put away by Bobby), I'd like to see them start together again.

3.  The team needs to be built around Eriksen.  Whatever it takes to lineup with him as our creative fulcrum, do it Timmy!

4.  Ultimately, we were lucky.  Soldado could've seen red, the actual red could easily have been missed by the ref, Konoplyanka hits the post, and Lloris makes some vital saves.  Our first half was as bad as our first leg.

There was a similar case in the Times a few weeks back where a dancer who kicked a man who was racially abusing him was let off with community service.

&gt; Victor Ibitoye had been riding a pedal cycle along Charminster Road in Bournemouth on November 6 last year when he was confronted by Mr Young, who said it was a ""dangerous"" activity.

&gt; Mr Ibitoye was walking next to Gill's ex-girlfriend, Wendy Cagua-Rodriguez, while the defendant walked behind.

&gt; He threw a single punch, connecting with Mr Young's temple, after hearing the victim say to Mr Ibitoye: **""Why don't you go back to the jungle?""**

The prosecution did not contest that Young had said that. Personally I don't believe racial slurs should be any more of a mitigating factor than any type of insult, but this appears to be how the law works now.

Edit: As comparison, take this quote [from a BBC article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-26354079).

&gt; Conservative MP David Davies told the Daily Mail it was an ""outrageously lean sentence"".

&gt; Chris Grayling told Daily Politics the sentence was being reviewed
""In two years he will be out walking the streets after taking somebody's life,"" he said.

&gt; ""He has attacked someone **unprovoked** and should be properly punished.

3) Fryers is the best fit at LB when Rose is out. Not Naughton or Vert. Solid all night, gets the assist on the 3rd. Let him challenge Rose for the Starting XI.

4) Townsend is NOT a RM, but rather a LM. He doesn't trust his right foot enough to play on the right flank.

5) Ade is a MONSTER. That 3rd though...Sexy.

6) Despite Soldado missing more chances tonight, Spurs NEED to play in a 4-4-2 against non-top-4 squads. More men in the box = more goals in Spurs' case.

7) Lloris is world class (but we already knew this).

8) Spurs fans are AMAZING (at WHL AND away).

Eriksen amd Vert would have their old coach back, and I think if anyine can convince Jan to stay, it is de Boer. Plus, de Boer will be able to bring Alderweireld in and he can take the spot from Dawson. In addition, Eriksen will be granted creative control of the midfield, something which sherwood has yet to realize he has to have. Eriksen's full potential was unlocked when he was at Ajax, and since coming to Tottenham, I don't think we've seen it yet. There have been flashes, but I think with the way he's played, he can't fully show it...de Boer can unleash it again.

Suppose if you will for a moment that Afghanistan was entirely justifiable war and that the deaths inflicted by our forces to be righteous deaths of an unwavering, wholly evil enemy. The state which upholds your civilisation is quite content for these men to die. Adebolajo has simply fallen to this enemy, he neither identifies with us or sees value in our continued existence. He is not our citizen.

Actually they are UK citizens, subject to English law. Your point is invalid.

&gt;If you can't admit that these men are our foes, you don't know an enemy when you see or hear one. If you don't want to destroy your enemies, you will be destroyed in turn.

That's juvinile at best...

Very interesting - I wonder what effects things like car fumes have on everyone who has to breath them over the same period.


&gt;Female bikers are also more susceptible to injury, for reasons that remain unclear.

Im going to guess its because on the whole they are not as fast as men and probably a little to timid for London roads.

&gt;in the Netherlands, a comprehensive and well maintained system of cycle tracks, physically protected from fast motor traffic, have helped to make cycling widespread at all ages and reduce the risks of injury. Providing similar quality infrastructure in London might help realise the substantial potential health benefits that cycling could offer.‚Äù

Good luck with that. God Id love it to happen, but I think there are to many who would appose it as it will either remove space for cars or remove space for pedestrians. And the UK does not like change, or to be told they might have to sacrifice something for the better good.

The other day there was a call in to the local radio (Norfolk) about introducing 20mph speed limits outside some schools. You would think someone had killed their mother the way some/most callers where taking it. If people cannot cope with slowing down for kids and maybe adding 5-20 seconds to their journey what hope do cycle paths have?

Sorry got all political.

RBS Group will probably jump ship and disappear off to London, because that's where the big money is.  The only reason their brand new HQ was built just outside Edinburgh was because of Fred Goodwin being based locally and wanting easy access to the airport for his golf trips - Stephen Hester and his successor are both London based permanently.

Pretty much all of the Edinburgh financial houses are London-headquartered or internationally owned (KPMG, Deloitte, Royal London etc.).

Seriously... you can kiss Edinburgh goodbye as the death rattle gets louder every time I visit.  I grew up there and pretty much *everyone* I know (in my upper-middle class social circles) works in some kind of finance/accounting or something which relies near-100% on the financial sector.  Those jobs will probably all pull out or be scaled back severely and this will have a knock-on effect on everything else.

&gt;You're missing the point of my post completely.

No I'm not.

&gt;Nothing *specific* bad has happened. And more importantly, nothing so bad that I'd be willing to turn the UK into the Ukraine right now.

So we leave it until such time where it is impossible to do something about it?  Infiltration, vilification, blackmail and destruction of protests and the leaders is possible right now. And I wouldn't put it past anyone to utilise it since it's already being outlined as use right now.

&gt;I don't agree with the shit that's going on, but I'm not about to compromise a comfy life, turning it into that kinda mess to do something about it.

When do you draw the line? Can you point to a specific action that will make you drop everything and protest and call for serious change? I'm not implying that things are as worse as Ukraine but you can make comparisons to it without sounding crazy. Corruption, disparity in wealth, corrupt leaders, money being stolen and/or given away to government friends, heavy handed treatment of protesters (not like Ukraine yet) etc. 

Right now, the infrastructure exists to disrupt and destroy protest groups before it even leaves Facebook or Reddit. The longer we leave this, the harder it's going to get for any opposition to be effective. The point has already been passed for me because of the realisation of the potential when it's been shown to be the case and the sustained corruption in our government.

Eto'o was a beast; everyone was surprised that he went to anzhi when he did. He was officially only 30, still with a couple of good years at the highest level. Of course they paid him an insane amount of money, but he could have taken his payday at 34 and gone to the MLS or Dubai or something. Also, when he went to chelsea, he didn't just look off the pace, he looked OLD. he's still good, but not the eto'o who was at inter. After many seasons at top clubs I can't believe he lost his cutting edge after two seasons in Russia. The league isn't THAT bad.

No, because Saddam ran a totalitarian police state which stopped them from blowing each other up. 

The Shi'ites lived in the south and didn't much like Saddam, so their main danger  was from the secret police. 

&gt;I'm sure if people had gone for it they could have charged him for crimes against humanities.

Could be. They may have been able to charge him with a war on aggression against Iran. But as he was supported by the West until the invasion of Kuwait, there was never going to be much effort to bring him to justice. 

The US encouraged Saddam to invade Iran, and facilitated Iraq's attacks with chemical weapons on Iranian military targets. 

&gt;There's simply no telling how he would have been involved in terrorism, or how we may have perceived him.

Terrorism simply wasn't his modus operandi. He didn't have control over any terrorist groups. He feared terrorism because he ruled a very divided country.

I have no further interest in anything you say or comment on, so much so, i have actually tagged you as ""Learning impaired"" and set you to ignore, so that i dont have to waste my time reading your inane nonsense.

That's entirely possible. As I mentioned,  he hasn't divulged his reasoning. I've seen a few suggestions about why Blair may have believed in an invasion of Iraq, but they are all speculation:

* Blair was a committed Atlanticist and wanted to preserve the UK alliance with the US.

* Blair genuinely believed the analysis that a UK/US invasion would bring about a rapid and relatively peaceful transition to democracy in Iraq. 

* Blair realised that sanctions were causing immense hardship to the Iraqi civilian population. Deposing Saddam was the most realistic way of ending the sanctions.

Because of the Spanish constitution, it is illegal for Catalonia to have any referendum on leaving Spain, so Madrid will never had consent. This means if Catalonia left, it would do so illegally, and the EU has already said that if it did leave, it wouldn't even consider an application because of this.

In short, Spain is fine with Scotland leaving and then joining the EU, if Westminster's fine with it. They would only oppose Scotland if it left illegally, according to the foreign minister, and, given the nature of the prime minister's comments, I think they were made on the assumption Scotland was planning to leave illegally.

I completely agree with you, but there is absolutely nothing to indicated that we're being controlled, nothing to show we're slaves in this world you seem to be making up. Go to China, you'll see a real police state, did you know most people there aren't aware of the famous [tank man?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank_Man) You seem to think every human with any sort of power is an evil all controlling power hungry person, who wishes to enslave humanity. They're not. You're not some sort of omniscient thinker, you're paranoid about something that simply isn't happening.

No evidence? We keep seeing worse and worse cases of more invasive tactics employed by the same countries you pointed out. Censoring of the internet is being tried with opt in censors, in the last week we have seen the intelligence agencies outlining covert operations against UK citizens without their knowledge to change the course of activism. I don't think every person with power is evil either, just the ones being specifically discussed at this time. In fact, you're levelling another piece of sensationalism against me. 

Don't tell me I'm paranoid either. I'm well aware that levelling accusation of paranoia in spite of the ongoing revelations is not something to be taken seriously. Before you were called paranoid and after you're paranoid. No matter what you see and prove, you're paranoid. People dealing in absolutes again despite what is continued to be shown are people I'm very wary of.

&gt;Obviously we're being watched on the internet, it's not meant for privacy. They're not removing information, i can still find every leaked document from the government if i want. The reality is they do not care. Is it that far beyond your belief that they MIGHT JUST be looking for terrorists, as opposed to monitoring every humans steps for the lulz?

You have a right to privacy and the right to assemble and organise protests without being infiltrated. Who said they were removing information? The documents show they are infiltrating people. They do not care but have continued to use a dragnet policy while stealing peoples webcam sessions in partnership with the NSA. If they didn't care, none of the information in the leaks would exist backed up with the admissions by the NSA they couldn't provide any example of them stopping terrorists. I'm not saying they are monitoring people for the lulz either.

true,veritanuda,null,null,"This is a well known scam and targets users using social engineering to make them think they are talking to their bank. Some simple rules prevents this kind of thing from happening.

* 1) Do they call you by name, or just the householder, owner or person registered at this address? Do they know your address? Get them to tell you it.

* 2) Do they identify the bank and branch correctly. If the caller cannot tell you your branch and part of your account number  without prompting they do not have your banking details in front of them
 
* 3) Never offer up information that is not required when dealing with someone you do not know. Remember they are calling you, so they should not need to fish for more information about who they are calling (unless of course they are selling something)

* 4) Always call your bank using your own numbers not numbers given to you. Using websites etc may or may not be wise depending on how alert you are with the rest of your life and internet. 

It is sad that this is quite a common scam and I personally worry about elderly people who are not as informed as the internet generation. I always recommend these sorts of people to just ban unknown numbers and that filters out 80% of the nuisance calls.

true,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"It's incredible to me the contempt our governments have for the citizens of their nations. I've been studying human rights and legal philosophy at university and you can really track the philosophical underpinnings of our societies throughout history: private property, limitation of monarchical and later state powers, liberalism, freedom of contract etc etc. All of this stuff is celebrated and we kind of hold ourselves up as a successful society - it's that sort of superiority the got us through the Cold War. I can't help but get the feeling that the security infrastructure means that we have to question whether the ideas we pat ourselves on the back for embracing actually exist in our societies at all. You can say with certainty that the American experiment in natural, constitutionally protected rights has been a total failure in the new millennia and European human rights law is toothless also. In the UK the ideas of John Locke and John Stewart Mill etc are supposedly the ideas we value but their ideas have failed in the modern age and our governments have jettisoned them secretly and now run the world using surveillance and massive invasion of privacy. 

Privacy is in many ways the basic essence of all rights - the right to be left alone; not to be killed or harmed, not to be coerced, not to have your property invaded, your conversations and opinions recorded and your associations infiltrated. There's almost no civil liberty or human right that does not boil down to the right to be free from state interference and the fact that this central right no longer exists basically causes the whole Jenga tower to fall down. We can't possibly have most general civil rights these days - it can't logically be supported. 

I tend to avoid over the top statements like this but it seems like a big deal that the theoretical and philosophical underpinning of our societies has been proved either to be flawed or at the very least unable to stand up to the practical threat of executive power. This moment is the same thing, academically and philosophically, that happened when the USSR collapsed; the only difference is we have money left and can pretend like nothing's wrong.

You're saying that we shouldn't discuss IF pedophiles molest children BECAUSE pedophiles molest children?

Sorry but you still need to address the original IF argument first before you can make the claim that we shouldn't be talking about that aspect of it, haha.

The thing is that you are factually wrong about this aspect, as there are an insane number of documented cases written by and about pedophiles regarding this.

You simply state that:

&gt; the fact they molest children

- When Townsend thinks ""pass"" first, he's quite effective.  Drew double-teams consistently and made some nice passes into Eriksen, Ade, and Moose (if I recall correctly).  Did not shoot once!  Still prefer him on the left, but I'll take ""playmaker"" Andros anywhere, and since Dnipro's main threat was their LW, I can understand Sherwood posting Andros on the right to help Naughton.

- People give Daws a lot of flak for his big diagonal passes, but tonight most of them hit the target.  Also, tonight, Vertonghen almost always passed it over to Daws to initiate the attack, rather than dribble it or pass it forward himself.  Not sure why Vert is so hesitant to initiate the attack himself, but if Daws gets the ball and is crowded by opposing players, what else should he do?  We all know Hugo took all his points out of ""Distribution"" in order to boost his other stats to max!        


And on the headbutt, as everyone has said, it's a red no matter what, and probably wouldn't have been called had Jan not drawn the referee's attention.  Even Brian McBride, a pretty damn tough player in his day, said exactly this and was perfectly fine with Vert's actions.

true,[deleted],null,null,"(I'm using a throw away so you cannot check through my history and find spurious ""evidence"" to accuse me of being a paedophile)

The ultimate point is that paedophilia is just an attraction, it is not an action. You can be a paedophile and never harm a child, whereas you can be a woman only attracted to over 50s and still harm children. Child abuse (and indeed a lot of abuse in general) is linked to things far beyond a desire for sexual enjoyment.

Pick a problem, drug abuse, alcoholism, anger, mental illness, if you alienate people with a problem then they are far more likely to succumb to that problem. That's not paedophilia propoganda, it's a fact. Helping people with problems is for the good of society: if someone has an alcohol problem we help them, if someone is mentally ill we help them, if someone is attracted to children shouldn't we help them? 

You're right that some paedophiles do commit acts of child abuse, you're right that paedophilia is not a mental illness and you're right that the comparisons to homosexuality *are* unreasonable, however none of that changes the fact that it's something individuals don't control, and therefore they should be given the help they need.

Vilifying anyone for a problem that they have that they don't control is unreasonable, the only thing humans do control are their action. A desire to have sex with a child isn't something a paedophile controls, but having sex with a child is, so we (society) should help them with their problem and then if they choose to act on their desires... well, that was their *choice*, we gave them the help they needed. Just like we help alcoholics and drug addicts and mentally ill people. 

You're also very right that these counter arguments *do* cause problems however when we live in a society that doesn't even know what the word paedophile means (according to the daily mail it means a child rapist) and would happily bring back the death penalty for accused paedophiles... there is a problem and there has to be a middleground and until there is a way for people to seek help without finding themselves in a compromising legal position something needs to change. Until that is the case these discussions do have a place.

We can't just leave people out in the cold because of something they don't control. I'm very attracted to Emma Watson and that isn't a choice or something I can turn off, but I do choose whether or not I have sex with her (well, assuming I'm presented with the option, suspend disbelief for arguments sake). If being attracted to Emma Watson was bad for society (or other individuals) then I should get help to end that attraction, or at least manage it.

Nobody (as far as I know) knows what causes paedophilia yet, so perhaps it *is* natural, but the point is that doesn't matter: children may come into harms way because of it so we should help those that suffer from it.

Protecting paedophiles isn't important, helping people is. ",0,1393555028,null,0,1393555253,0,cfqmij2,t3_1z3f2o,t1_cfqmij2,t1_cfqfqjs,null,1432592939,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

Like it or not, we live in a capitalist society. Investment banking is a logical consequence of capitalism. Many people don't like bankers, but pretty much everyone in the country benefits from their activities in some way.

If you have a mortgage, the money probably ultimately comes from an investment bank.

If you have a pension, the money is held in a fund, many of which are owned by investment banks. This means that the amount you receive when you retire is much more than the amount you paid in - the same with insurance.

The government is able to spend more than it receives in taxes by issuing bonds, which an investment bank either buys itself, or sells to the public.

Looking at the whole world, you could argue that capitalism is a terrible system.

Ultimately, there is nothing wrong with the system as it is. Child abusers are prosecuted, paedophiles who do not act on their desires are not prosecuted.

This wont always work. Things like banks and other call centres have strict policies relating to Data Protection and cannot give out information unless the person confirms their identity. 

Its likely that a real bank would be suspicious if the person they are calling started asking for their own address and other details relating to the account. They will not give it to you unless you confirm it first.

&gt;so they should not need to fish for more information about who they are calling (unless of course they are selling something)

Again bad advice, institutions like bank have to confirm identity before discussing things relating to an account holders an account, they will do this by asking you to confirm information such as your DOB and address. 


Banks and other firms take things like these very seriously and you will be instantly fired for breaching any policy relating to Data Protection such as giving out information when you shouldn't have because of the massive liability it opens them up to.

Like /u/jimmithy said, Palace, West Brom, Everton, Norwich, Hull, Chelsea, Newcastle, Villa, Southampton and Sunderland are coming up, and we could win a lot of those games. Swansea haven't played poorly under Monk and if they continue the way they have played against Cardiff and Napoli, no team should be impossible. Ideally we win 7 of the next 10, and I see no reason not to believe that it's possible with how we played tonight and against Liverpool. 

Back to the game, Bony should've scored that header but he created chances out of nothing with some of his shots and assisted the goal. He is only human (although he sometimes seems more than that). Emnes looked good at times, and when he defended, he looked pretty good back there for a forward. When Taylor came on, I felt like he offered nothing but then again it was late in the game. I wish Angel Rangel had been playing, although Tiendalli wasn't too bad today. De Guzman looked quick and creative at times which is good to see. His goal was well hit and he had a few other good shots. It was a shame to take off Routledge, he really is our best winger IMO and is so skillful.

Coining phrases like 'tribal binary' marks you as a pseud and a fool. The oldschool socialists used to talk about 'class warfare' and although that is indeed a divisive and flawed concept, there is a grain of truth to it. Social mobility has been declining for a while now and the stuff that is going on in the name of austerity might as well be called a war on the poor.

As for 'leaned helplessness', is that what happens when the Torys close all the pits and factories and leave your town with 30% unemployment for decades ever since ? There are still plenty of places where there are just_no_jobs. And besides that, there are plenty of people in society who, through no fault of their own, simply need help. The sick, the disabled etc. I don't doubt there are a certain number of freeloaders too, but it seems to me that they are a price worth paying in order for there to be a safety net for the deserving.

Anyway, I certainly agree that the labor party are for the most part a bunch of crooks. Very much so. But out of the 2 bunches of crooks (in what you might call the party-political binary) they are the less inclined to dismantle the social safely nets. Personally I like having social safety nets around, despite my having plenty of savings. Not everyone is so lucky. As for insurance, have you never heard of national insurance ? plenty of people nowadays might wonder why they have been paying into it for all those years as they don't seem to get much in return nowadays when they need it. 

For the record, I live my own life very frugally and am strongly anti-consumerist. I have saved plenty and never inherited a penny. But my lifestyle is none of your business either.

OP -- medical training differs significantly in the UK and the US.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but in America as I understand it, wannabe-physicians study an undergraduate degree of their choice while also pursuing a pre-med programme. You then enter medical school as a postgraduate where you do your actual doctor's training.

In the UK a medical doctor degree is one you enter as an undergraduate. It's significantly longer than a normal degree (taking anything up to 7 years to complete) and in the latter part you get involved in clinical work in hospitals.

The equivalent for Liverpool would be the Kop.

So, I would suggest something like:

YNWA

Kop + Thyra 7

96 + 21

117 (like /u/pos_hodg suggested)

Great stuff nonetheless as in the picture you added in a comment.

true,JamesB5446,cnty-scotland,Cleethorpes,"&gt; It's not about encouraging/discouraging driving. 

It is.

&gt; The choice for many, especially in rural areas (which public transport will never serve effectively), is between driving and unemployment.

Because all other transport options have been ignored in favour of the car.

&gt; It's not possible for everyone to live in the city centres - where public transport kind-of-works, leaving the countryside purely for weekends/tourism...

Of course it isn't. No one is saying that it is. Public transport and cycling CAN work in rural areas though.

&gt; Cycling is not a solution. It might be a good thing, but will only ever be viable for a few percent. 

What do you mean by 'a few'? 19% in Denmark. 26% in the Netherlands. Less than 2% here. It can be a solution for a lot of people if you invest in it. All the evidence shows this.

&gt; Many commutes are far too long - and that's only going to get worse with a weak job market, no job security, and pumped-up property prices. Living near work is a luxury that many can't afford.

I won't discuss the work situation here, as that is not what we're talking about, but I will acknowledge that something massive needs to be done about it.

Now, on to commute distance. [Over 60% of journeys in the UK are under 5 miles.](http://joedunckley.wordpress.com/2012/10/02/in-answer-to-your-questions/) This is an easy distance to cycle for anyone but the disabled. Around 40% are less than 2 miles.

&gt; And most people won't cycle because the weather here is shit.

[Unlike in the Netherlands?](http://richardtulloch.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/bike-snow-parool.jpg)

&gt; And you can't really cycle in a suit.

[You can.](http://img245.imageshack.us/img245/7711/donnerbinnenhof.jpg)

&gt; And it doesn't work for older/less healty workers.

[In the Netherlands the distance risen by over 65s is growing.](http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2012/04/challenges-to-growth-in-cycling-in.html)

&gt; And there's rarely anywhere to store bikes.

Then build it. There was no where to park cars until car parks were built.

&gt; But mostly, because the weather is so bad...

We've covered this one.

&gt; No, cycling is not a replacement for the car.

Not for all journeys, no. But for a huge number it could be.

Sorry if I've come off as confrontational at all. I just think it's important to make people see the truth of the matter. We live in a car centric society and it is hurting us. There is a better way.

&gt; Trains are good. But if you're opposed to road building, I'm sure you'd be even more opposed to lots of new high-speed railway lines being built?

There are plenty of old railway lines that could be reopened. There are plenty of lines open now that could use more trains.

&gt; But HS2 is enough to prove that we're not capable of such big infrastructure projects (spanning multiple governments, all thinking super-short-term) any more.

Not really.

&gt; It's unlikely that railways will ever be significantly expanded, isn't it?

Pedophilia exists, and an illicit market for child pornography exists. Until as a society we properly grapple with this, this state will continue.

true,collinsl02,null,null,"Other people seem to be covering the ""why do you want a degree here"" part, so I will comment on the course structure here, general life in the UK, and I will try and answer some questions you have asked.

I will base all of this on the assumption that you know nothing about anything here, so sorry if some of this is basic and/or insulting to your intelligence, but I don't know you or how much you know. :-)

First off, general life vs the USA, as seen by a Student (I graduated from the University of Portsmouth with a BSc in Computer Networks in June last year.). Please also note that my statements apply to England and Wales only, Scotland has a slightly different university system. And all points are based on my personal study at the Uni of Portsmouth - some unis may operate differently although where I know of a difference I will try and mention it. Anyway, [bring on the wall!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-so-NVcRKv4) (of text):

The standard length of an undergraduate degree in the UK is three years, four years if you choose to do a year of placement work in between years 2 and 3. This is usually taught in units that are all based around the degree subject. UK university students generally only study their degree topic and do not study ""base"" units like English or Maths, unless they are relevant to the degree.

My degree was earned through the gaining of credits over the years I was studying. I assume this is the same at all unis although that might not be the case. Each unit I passed was worth a set number of credits and I had to gain enough credits by the end of the degree to pass. This only proved that I had completed the required number of units, though. My grade was determined by the marks I got in each unit, put through a complex set of formulas to give each student the best possible degree.

The grades available to UK students are similar to the USA but they are expressed differently. We don't give the grades latin names like you do. We have the following grades:

* 1st (first) - This is the highest grade and, at least at my uni, was only awarded to students who got over 80% overall (IIRC)
* 2:1 (two-one) - This is awarded to students who get between 70 and 80%
* 2:2 (two-two) - This is awarded to students who get between 60 and 70%
* 3rd (third, ordinary, pass) - This is awarded to students who get between 40 and 60%. It is classed as being ""without honours"" whereas the 1st, 2:1 and 2:2 are all honours degrees. This entitles graduates to put (hons) after the bachelor part of their title e.g. ""BSc(hons) Computer Networks"".

Your degree should be applicable in the USA as it can be translated into an equivalent US certification, and any other certifications you get whilst studying should be internationally recognised. 

Next, housing. Your first year of study can generally be spent in university-provided accommodation if you so choose. Rent for these rooms will normally be lower than renting a shared house elsewhere and most universities have enough rooms to provide accommodation for most of their first years. Some don't, and some have more than enough and allow second and third years to rent as well on a first-come first-served basis.

This accommodation will normally be of a decent standard and you can expect all amenities to be included in the rent. Universities will generally own different ages of buildings with different layouts for different prices. For instance Portsmouth offered a brand new building the year I started, with rents being in the range of ¬£280/300 per calendar month, which had flats of I think 5 people, each of whom had an en-suite bathroom in their rooms. They also offered a listed historic building with individual rooms (again with en-suite) with catering provided for about ¬£450/month, as well as a few other buildings. Down the other end of the scale was the building I lived in, which happened to be about 15 years old (so not that old) but was 8 people to a flat with a shared kitchen and bathrooms for ¬£170/month. 

In your second and final year you will likely have to find a house share to move into. The university offers help finding places, and generally will have a list of landlords they know and approve of, but otherwise, just find a group of friends to fill a house, find a house, rent it, and move in. The quality of student housing varies a lot with area, and how much you want to pay. You can find some real dumps if you don't want to pay much (relative to the city/area you are in) or you can find some really high-class places if you have the cash to spare. It's all up to you and whoever you decide to live with.

When you do start house-hunting, look out for places that use an agency to rent. The agency generally charges a hefty fee for references, credit checks, finding a guarantor, and their work in renting the place. Also note that a deposit of at least one month's rent will be required by the landlord. This will be returned to you when you end the tenancy, as long as there aren't any damages to deduct from it. In the UK almost all landlords have to place this deposit into an approved Deposit Protection Scheme which is there to arbitrate in any differences you and the landlord have at the end of your contract - it basically holds your deposit so the landlord can't make up some bogus reason to not give it back to you.

I won't comment on social rules because I have ASD and don't really understand them myself, so I will leave that to someone more qualified. I will say however, that as long as you are polite and friendly you will be fine. As /u/wil says, don't be a dick! ;-)

Right, language differences: I've put the ones I can think of down, I know there are plenty more. These are also in the order I think of them. Left column is USA, right is UK

* Jelly = Jam
* Chips = crisps
* French Fries = chips
* eggplant = aubergine
* rutabaga = swede
* stick-shift = manual
* soccer = football
* football = American football (otherwise known as hand-egg ;-))
* gasoline = petrol
* gas pedal = accelerator pedal
* cell phone = mobile phone
* turn signal = indicator
* bum = tramp, vagrant
* fanny = a ladies' front parts, not the bottom. Be careful with this one! Also somehow a name that lots of old people have. Don't know how that came about!
* fanny pack = bum bag
* slang for bottom = bum, arse
* ass = donkey (spelling difference, might be the same in the US, I'm not sure)
* homely = not ugly, rather it is used for nice to look at
* your word ""quite"" means very = our word ""quite"" means ""somewhat"" 
* you use ""please"" to express exasperation = we use ""please"" to express politeness at a personal request, even if the person is just doing their job, which reminds me:
* server = waiter/waitress
* pants = trousers
* slang for cigarette = fag. This has developed a more sexual description for a gay man more recently but this definition is not as widespread as in the US. Fagging was also a tradition at public schools and universities (a tradition which has long since abolished) where a younger boy was required to act as a sort of servant for an older boy, doing things like toasting his crumpets or warming a cold toilet seat for him, or running small errands. This has meant that fag has also become a connotation for ""a bother"" a la:
* a bit of a bother = a bit of a fag although this isn't used much any more
* barkeep/bartender = generally referred to by name if you're a regular in the pub, or as ""mate"" or just no name.
* subway = underground, tube (London only)
* underpass = subway, when referring to a pedestrian tunnel under a road.
* when referring to time, ""half"" meaning half way to = ""half"" meaning half past the hour. We also say things like ""ten past"" where you might say ""ten of""
* Republican (as in politics) in the UK means someone who wants to abolish the monarchy and make the UK a republic. They are generally left of centre in their policies. What you would call a Republican most closely translates to what we would call a Conservative.

Right, areas: First off, the southern half of the UK is the more expensive for pretty much everything. It also has the better weather (generally), and is more socially and economically active than the north. This isn't to say that the north is in any way bad, just that the south has certain advantages.

Opinions on which cities are the best are naturally wildly different from person to person, and I will do my best to provide an objective view here. My suggestion to you would be to look at the websites for the UK universities (a list can be found [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_universities_in_the_United_Kingdom)), find the ones that offer the course you want, and start a new thread on here to get our collective opinions on the location choices you have.

In general terms the UK is split into the following areas:

* Scotland and Northern Ireland - not covered here as you have specifically said you were looking at England)
* The North - this region extends from the Scottish border down to somewhere between Sheffield and Nottingham.
* The Midlands - the area in the centre of the country, generally divided in to the East Midlands and the West Midlands. This extends from the ""border"" with the North to just north of London.
* Wales - It's own principality.
* The ""home counties"" - the area around London where people generally live and commute into London to work. Also known as the ""south East""
* The south-west - Devon, Cornwall, etc in the ""leg"" of England below Wales, with a border with the south east somewhere around the border with Hampshire.

Beyond this the UK is divided into Counties - These are regional administrative units rather like the counties in the USA.

2A(X*Y)=Z

Short answer?

Prepare your anus.

Serious answer - I would expect the touts will be demanding ¬£200+ each on the day before the match for a ¬£50/60 seat. There are no tickets to be had anywhere officially, and there is already a post on this sub of someone complaining that they have bought tickets from a website on the internet and ended up with nothing. That price might come down if a tout is holding tickets when the match kicks off, but that is your risk to take.

If you are willing to spend that much, you could try contacting the club direct and seeing if there is a reserve list of sorts for hospitality packages. At least you will get an official ticket, matchday programme and a prawn sandwich for your hundreds of pounds.

Given that the game is live on BT Sport, the other alternative is to go to the ground, maybe have a wander/soak up what little atmosphere there will be (as it's a lunchtime KO) and then go to a local pub that is showing it on a big screen - I would expect there are plenty others doing something similar. At least then you can have a drink and food while you watch.

Asolutely not! They will look at them and go ""Hang on, that can't be right! I thought men are attracted to women, most men are, why isn't he? Surely that needs to be fixed. Besides, with two men there is no baby at the end and all purpose of life is to reproduce!!! Surely that needs to be fixed"". This mentality is STILL the status quo. ""No baby = defect"". You'd be surprised how many ""pro-gay"" people still think this assumption is correct despite being oh so loving. They are my friend and they love me, but they still see me as defected and they still see me as ""lesser""; that ain't equality.  

Homosexuality exists in 1500 species and homophobia exists in one; unfortunately our conscious comes with it's disadvantages and one of those disadvantages is making catastrophic errors of judgement. Humans are fucking stupid; look at all the stupid shit humans have done throughout history. So much stupid shit. So many arrogant assumptions that turned out to be totally false. So many stupid theories and ideas that turned out to be absolute wank. SO much stupid shit. I have a hard time conceptualizing a scenario in which someone would see a gay couple for the first time and accept it totally without question. 

No doubt malice has played a huge role in regards to the oppression of gay people and they became a useful political scape goat, but the stupidity and sheer *arrogance* of humans suggests some kind of confusion and homophobia was probably inevitable due to the 90/10 ratio. Religion, sexism, political scape goating, strict gender roles, extreme emphasis on heterosexual relationships and sheer sociopathy have only served to blow it up beyond all proportion. 

Keeping gays oppressed has proven to be a win/win for everyone who isn't gay. Keeping gays oppressed benefits many people in many ways, it was only natural they would try to keep it going until we bashed back.

Uh, no. I think pedophiles should have a ""safe space"" because it means they are much less likely to abuse children because they have therapy or counseling or tools to deal with their urges or are put on a register and on the record. Not to feel ""just"" or ""vindicated"". 

I do not condone their behaviour, but I believe demonizing them and scaring them into hiding puts children at greater risk of abuse and therefore should not be encouraged. 

Scaring pedophiles into the shadows by demonizing them like you are doing and accusing anybody who might disagree with you of being a pedophile is only making children more vulnerable to abuse I'm afraid.  

A pedophile in the shadow is more likely to abuse because he has nothing to stop him acting on his urges; a pedophile in the open is less likely to abuse because they have already pre-empted the chance of abuse and made efforts to reduce the risk of abuse. The current situation is one in which NO effort is made to pre-empt abuse, it can only be dealt with AFTER the damage is done and that depends on IF the victim comes forward. 


So in reality your argument is much more dangerous to the well being of children than the ""counter arguments"" I'm afraid.

I'm not disagreeing with you that a lot of things that were initially said about Menezes were later shown to be incorrect. You're right that several events are, or were, disputed.

The point I'm making is that I don't think this is some grand scheme orchestrated at the highest levels to deliberately smear his name in order to protect the name of the Police. Yes, there were a series of screw-ups in the way the operation, and later the investigation, were conducted. But no, that does not mean that ""the Police"" are ""smearing"" his name.

&gt; It's really shocking how a fanbase that's rivals with Manchester United could actually be more smug than them.

I don't think I need to refresh anyone's memory; over the last half decade (and arguably further), our performances in the league have been disappointing for us, and all the while United have been consistently challenging for and winning titles. Now, for the first time in what feels like a lifetime, we are not only outperforming United, but we're 11 points clear. I'm not saying that all Liverpool supporters have reacted modestly, but let's not pretend that United fans didn't act smug towards Liverpool fans (and the rest of the league's supporters) during their period of success. If Spurs currently sat in 4th while Arsenal dwindled in 6th/7th, I'm sure you wouldn't pass up a chance to remind them.

&gt; Liverpool are shit for half a decade, have one decent season where they're not even in the top 3 and you'd think they were god's gift to football.

This isn't a particularly strong argument as while Liverpool have certainly been under-performing for years now, Spurs haven't finished in the top 3 since 1989-90. Liverpool fans have a lot to be proud of this year, but I think a general consensus on our sub has been to view this season with cautious optimism. There are eleven matches left, we still have to play Spurs, and anything can happen. 

&gt;Liverpool fans, however, are the smuggest, most pretentious, unbearable, spiteful little cunts I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with online.

I'm sorry this has been your experience, but any club will have a minority of emotional fans hiding behind the anonymity of their user names to voice their frustrations online. For example, take that /u/Waffuls guy, I mean just who does he think he is?! ;)

In all seriousness, good luck with the rest of your season. You have a strong side and I think you've been performing quite well under Sherwood. I personally would have no qualms with Spurs finishing 4th, of course as long as it doesn't come at our expense. :)",0,1393584431,null,0,false,0,cfqurog,t3_1z4gci,t1_cfqurog,t1_cfqfmtk,null,1432596906,33,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,33

This benefit of this is that you keep you money in your account longer (more interest earned), you get a small percentage back from CC, you get lots more insurance, protection against fraud etc and you build a good credit rating.

true,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"It's the nature of growth of pretty much every subreddit. When it's small, when it's only people who really have an interest in the main focus of discussion, then the content is typically pretty focused. When the sub gets bigger, the discussion gets diluted by a lot of fluff and pictures. We've nearly doubled in size as a subreddit since I first started browsing here - it's been a fairly rapid growth recently. 

The issue is that as you get more people, the proportion of people who will just see stuff from the front page, or won't pay too much attention to self posts and the comments, starts to go up. Things like images that take two or three seconds to digest and then upvote get a lot more upvotes than long-ish self posts that a lot of people will tl;dr or not even click in the first place. Fairly low-content submissions start to dominate the top page because they have a much higher click-through rate than the proper discussion posts. 

This kind of complaint and ""ugh we're going to turn into /r/gaming (or insert other pretty much meme-only sub here)"" has come up for every single sub I've seen grow past 10k users. It's the nature of how Reddit and the upvote system for content works. The only way to stop it happening is for mods to crack-down and change the rules and start enforcing them a little more (and then you typically get the backlash of people saying they're being nazis and killing the fun content). Or you just settle for the fact that there'll be plenty of light content that makes it to the top of the front page. 

There's also just a natural fact that the transfer windows has gone and it's a while until the next one, and we're only playing matches once a week at most, so in general the amount of proper news and interesting stuff related to the club is fairly slow on a day-to-day basis. 

And for the people posting ""if you want more quality content then make it yourself"", it doesn't work like that. Quality content can exist and not get high up the front page if people upvote other stuff more. And it takes someone a lot longer to make a carefully thought-out discussion post than it does for someone to just stick a screenshot on imgur and post it.

The fact that Reddit gives people the ability to downvote what they don't agree with and upvote what they do (for all the ""that's not how voting is meant to work"", it's how it does work in practice a lot of the time), plus the social pressure to not post something that'll be downvoted, means that it's really common for proper hivemind stuff to go on. It's really easy for ideas to snowball and suddenly there's a lot of consensus for one opinion and it's sacrilege to argue otherwise when actually it's not even necessarily true.

Suddenly we collectively blame Ian Ayre for everything in the transfer window, when there's a whole transfer committee and no real evidence to suggest it's directly his fault at all. In particular when we were having inconsistent results in January it was awfully obvious how there'd be a knee-jerk consensus that would snowball after every game, and the subreddit as a whole seemed to flip week-on-week from thinking top 4 was safe and we might challenge for the title, and then suddenly we're really going to struggle for top four without signing and DM and other players. Same group of people on here, same players on the pitch, yet we were only ever 90 minutes away from ""This team is amazing we can challenge for the title"" or ""We're not good enough, top 4 is going to be a struggle"".

Consider a (slightly different) situation where the seats went 300 apiece to Labour and Cons, with the rest apportioned to Lib Dems. Here, Lib Dems have *all* the power, unless Lab and Cons agree completely on an issue which the Lib Dems don't (which is unlikely) - the Lib Dems can threaten to block the Tories' entire legislative agenda unless they get the policies they want, and they can do the same with Lanour on the other side.

The situation we've got is a bit different - the Tories have enough MPs that the Lib Dems can't guarantee that they are 'kingmakers', but they certainly should have more clout than their proportional size suggests. If they refuse to back the government on a given issue the Tories need to go scrabbling around the independents to drum up support (and would you count on the Greens or SNP not voting with the Lab block just to piss off the Tories and make headlines?)

It's actually very surprising what a big deal some of the by-elections were because the House is so finely balanced - each Tory unseated should be a *massive* boost in the Lib Dem power base because it raises the number of Independent votes the Tories have to find to stop a Lib Dem / Lab coalition blocking their plans.

So I am disappointed with Clegg because I don't think he held his nerve long enough to deliver those policies which his supporters wanted; he turned what could have been essentially a Lib Dem majority government into a messy coalition in which the Tories appear to be doing more or less what they want and the Lib Dems are taking the blame.",0,1393588486,null,0,false,0,cfqvdcr,t3_1z3tr8,t1_cfqvdcr,t1_cfqf7z9,null,1432597178,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

The obvious diplomatic tactic for Russia is for  Yanukovych to claim that he still represents the legitimate government, and to request military assistance. Together with Russia's veto on the UN security council, this could make any coordinated response quite difficult. 

The UK and Germany would be more willing in principle to get involved in a conflict in their back yard than in a complex multi faceted civil war in Syria. And the logistics will be easier. I imagine all leave is cancelled in several EU countries at the moment. But they will be reluctant to get involved in a conflict where the other side has nuclear weapons, and will be slowed down by the diplomatic issues. By the time they get their act together, if they ever do,  they could be presented with a  fait accompli.

The same goes for the US.

Looks like it all depends on whether Russia manages to peacefully detach the Crimea. Otherwise a Crimean War II would be ugly. I don't suppose it would have the same participants as last time round: it would be more of a proxy war.

And I agree, to be honest, there's a limited amount of discussion to really be had week on week. We play a match at the weekend, and then in the week there's not really much to talk about when the post-match stuff has died down and it's too far looking forward to start the pre-match hype for the next one. We can talk about Reina leaving, but that's going to sustain one thread for a day or so and then it's a topic that's been covered. 

I guess what I'd mostly want to make sure is that discussion keeps existing, and that proper information on things like the new stadium, and interesting player interviews don't just get drowned out by ""hey look at this wallpaper I made"", ""look at this cool picture of Suarez"" or ""lol this old quote by Gerrard"".

Yes, one of these is divisive, the other encourages us to look for the best in other people groups.

&gt; congratulations you are a hypocrite.

I'm not a hypocrite because my reasons are that one of these characterisations is divisive and the other isn't. Try to keep up there mate.

&gt; and stop myself from making bigoted and unfair assumptions about groups using appallingly bad reasoning

Congratulations. This is entirely reasonable.

&gt; do you find this acceptable if someone lists ""good Nazis"" under the statement of ""when i think of Nazis i think of...""

This would be seen as endorsing a political ideology. Whereas in this case she is clearly not endorsing Muslim beliefs. She is acknowledging the positive contributions that some Muslims make and by doing so combating divisive attitudes that are pre-existent.

The thing that makes attacking a political ideology okay is that one is not attacking a person (or a people group that to a large extent can't help but be what they are), but rather an idea. Being a Muslim is something far more personal and is closely tied to somebody's cultural identity.

&gt; By applying any bias to a group you make a clear statement to everyone you are biased and unreasonable and irrational

Trying to disprove it is indeed the entire point. But refuting facts needs evidence, not speculation.

&gt; Instead, people who question it are labelled and ridiculed. 

If they question it with credible reasoning, that is fine. The people who are labelled and ridiculed are those who are ignoring decades of research and investigation, repeating old myths that have been disproved long ago.

&gt; Again, the global cooling thing is back - http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/16/another-year-of-global-cooling/

A year or three of global cooling doesn't mean that there is no such thing as global warming. The timescale needs to be centuries, not a few years. I suggest you read this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change

&gt; No, you read the criticisms of the petition, but you neglected their response. Simply saying it isn't credible doesn't make it so. 

I read their responses. It doesn't change my mind; the petition is a joke for the reasons discussed at length in [this section](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Petition#Credentials_and_authenticity).

&gt; If you think ridicule should ever be a part of science then you are very much part of the problem. 

Science doesn't work by being diplomatic. You need to have evidence. When someone ignores all evidence that refutes their position, how are you supposed to take them seriously?

true,_lolwhat_,IM,isle of man,"What the fuck are you talking about? ""Innocent until proven guilty"" is an **assumption** that you are innocent. It is not a law.

Let me try to say this in simple and concise english as this seems to be very hard for you to grasp.

1) John Terry was charged with racial abuse (this is the actual charge levied on Terry)

2) In Terrys defence, he states that he was merely repeating what the thought Anton Ferdinand asked him. 

3) The magistrate pretty much says Terrys defence is complete bollocks. Meaning, his defence (his ""excuse) was completely untrue. This also means they believe that John Terry is guilty of insulting Ferdinand.

4) Terry is cleared of the racial abuse charges. Yes, John Terry is not a racist. 

5) Being cleared of racial abuse charges does not mean that John Terry did not insult Anton Ferdinand. There mere fact that he added the word ""black"" is the reason why he was suspended by the FA. 

Let's try that again. Being cleared of the charges of racial abuse, does not mean that his story is true. As I pointed out earlier, they believe Terrys defence is a complete lie. What they believe is that John Terry uttered the words ""fucking black cunt"" as an insult to Ferdinand.  

One more time as it seems like you are hooked into this, ""his charges were cleared, it means his story must be true!"". Terry getting cleared racial abuse does not make his contrived story true. It just means he isn't a racist. The court just believes he is use of ""fucking black cunt"" was that of an insult. 

And finally, you mean to tell me that he lied, to protect himself, only to tell the ""truth"" when he got caught on video? Then we are suppose to believe that now? And you say I am deluded?

Well, I kind of do. Although we have to deal with the fact that there is no single, common, definition of ""paedophilia"" or ""child abuse.""

[This article](http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/3097/how-common-is-pedophilia) puts the prevalence at 3-7%, and goes with a definition hinging on prepubescence.

[This article](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Pedophilia#Prevalence) (with references) starts at 4%, but acknowledges it could be 25-30%.

[This page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paedophilia#Prevalence_and_child_molestation) has some more figures; only 7% of child sex offenders considered themselves exclusive paedophiles, and it notes ""88% of child molestation offenders who meet the diagnostic criteria for pedophilia"", so 12% don't.

[This page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse#United_States_and_Europe) gives several figures for the prevalence of abuse, suggesting that around 10-12% of children are the victims of adult-child sexual abuse. Assuming a small number of multiple-victim abusers, that suggests around 8-10% of the population have committed child abuse. Which would give 7-9% being paedophiles committing abuse based on the above data.

Which means either the statistics are wrong (on percentage of abuse by paedophiles) or we're using the broader definitions.

In this thread we're talking about laws against ""child porn"" and so on, which will come with a far broader definition of paedophile than the general medical one (anyone under 18 v anyone prepubescent), so that 25-30% figure is probably more accurate for this definition (and may be an underestimate). If we go with those numbers, we can see that at least 1/2, more like 2/3rds of paedophiles aren't committing child abuse.

----------

So while I don't have precise data on it (for obvious reasons), it is possible to put together some rough numbers.

As for the extent to which it is a problem, the main legal reasoning problem I have here is that there is an assumption that paedophiles (using the broad legal definition) are dangerous because they might sexually assault children as they are sexually attracted to them. But similar logic would say that all heterosexual or bisexual or homosexual men are dangerous because they might sexually assault adults as they are sexually attracted to them. The only real difference seems to be that most children are more vulnerable than most adults.",1,1393594478,null,0,false,0,cfqwjxg,t3_1z3f2o,t1_cfqwjxg,t1_cfqnpph,null,1432597736,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Precisely - *something* - so let's all make assumptions to suit our agendas and make something out of nothing shall we? 

His own family tried to provide him money and are quoted as saying 'by then it was too late' despite trying to help him *weeks* before he died -as the article quotes. 

If they feared for his well-being then why did they or his doctor not try to hospitalise him for care? Saying he was an independent man does not cut it - if I had a family member in such circumstances, I wouldn't hesitate to ensure they were OK beyond throwing some money at them and assuming it would stick. 

Despite that, they *did* throw money at him and he gave it away. If I'm under financial pressure and my family offers me money, I use it and pledge to return it to them when I'm able or to provide for them in some way. 

There are deep issues in this man's well-being and state of mind that run far beyond the regular person you might pass on the street. You choose to pin it on benefits alone and ignore the other issues at stake.

Traditionally the clubs are fierce rivals and direct transfers between the clubs have been a rarity. That simply will not change. 

On top of that, why would utd want to strengthen their rival in the EPL with one of the biggest potentials in the league, both on the pitch and in the marketing department?

I also doubt they've given up on him, especially now that Moyes' future is so uncertain. Kagawa has proven he can be a very useful player and if they do change managers, why would they rid themselves of a player with so much potential?

The whole deal would be very pricey as well. He's on big wages and utd would surely want to recoup their investment and then some, because that's just how it goes with transfers within the league.

true,JamesB5446,cnty-scotland,Cleethorpes,"&gt; Part of the problem with bus transport here is that one company practically has a monopoly in the area. There is one smaller firm, but it takes even longer to get around as it snakes through every little hamlet. The bus companies can charge whatever they damn well like, and throwing money at them to subsidise fares won't do anything unless there is a solid written agreement, which has been fruitlessly talked about for years.

Totally agree. Many countries in Europe have publicly owned transport, it works much better for the customer.

&gt; As for trains, thanks to Dr Beeching there haven't been any local train routes here for decades.

Indeed. Something we need to consider reversing.

&gt;  Bicycles are also very nice in flat terrain but are very impractical in hills, or where your place of work is more than a few miles away.

They're not that impractical in hills. Limburg is the only part of the Netherlands with hills, but they still have a way higher rate of cycling than anywhere else outside of the country.

As for distance, depends what you mean by a few miles? And seeing as more than half of trips in the UK are under 5 miles I don't think it's such a worry.

&gt; To cap it all off, with a car I can come and go as I please.

More so on a bike.

&gt; It is indeed cheap to run, but even my older car was still notably cheaper than a bus.

Indeed. This shows how privatised public transport doesn't work.

&gt; Your car is never late, and it never drives off without you ten minutes early to save time.

Depends where you park it. ;)

&gt; I'd love a viable system of public transport here, but the practicality of the matter is that cars are a much cheaper option out here. Everyone wants the best improvements possible with the minimum amount of investment, and here as a matter of simple pragmatism that means roads. Unless some landmark deal provides cheap, reliable, regular buses that aren't going to jack up fares to match the subsidy is struck, I'll stick with the most eminently practical travel arrangement possible; my car.

Indeed. I'm not saying that public transport in the UK is practical for most people, or that cycling in the UK is inviting for most people. What I'm saying is that they SHOULD be.
