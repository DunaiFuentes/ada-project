I think it can go one of two ways - as is always the case with West Ham. If Sam wins the fans over (unlikely) and the players gel well; I see no reason we can't finish top 10. However, if not, shit will hit the fan and big Sam will be gone by November - and then, fuck knows.

-------------------------


**3 players to look out for:**

* Enner Valencia - a complete and utter gamble so nobody knows how well he'll do. Also... We'll only pay £12.5m for him in addons (i.e. if he matches a certain quota of goals / assists etc)

* Aaron Cresswell - in the championship team of the season and can deliver a great cross. Pretty much fills the quota for us. Also has formed a great partnership with Matt Jarvis down the left hand side!

* Mauro Zarate - 19 goals in 29 appearances last year ^^in ^^the ^^Argentinian ^^league and we got him for a free. He's looked sharp in preseason so hopefully he'll carry it on into the season.


-------------------------

**Lineups**

At the start of the season, Sam will likely opt with [this](http://i.imgur.com/Gc7Bnq0.png) (yawn).

But I'm hoping by the end of the season it'll be a bit more like [this](http://i.imgur.com/ew8MbUq.png) or [this](http://i.imgur.com/YpBtiKq.png) (look at me using arrows and shit).

After this is done, pour it into a bowl, and grate some cheese onto it to make it all gooey.  While doing this, microwave half a tin of Curry Baked Beans (I even add curry powder to this), for two minutes.

Wait... if god views blood as representing life, wouldn't blood transfusions to save someone's life be beautiful?

I mean, it's literally giving life to someone else by transferring blood! 

AARGH

So I checked this site:

http://www.jw.org/en/jehovahs-witnesses/faq/jehovahs-witnesses-why-no-blood-transfusions/

And the bits of the bible they reference are:

&gt; Just be firmly resolved not to eat the blood, because the blood is the life, and you must not eat the life with the flesh.

Err ok. ""Eat"" is not an unusual choice of words, this part of the bible is *literally* talking about eating meat.

&gt; “‘If any man of the house of Israel or any foreigner who is residing in your midst eats any sort of blood, I will certainly set my face against the one who is eating the blood, and I will cut him off from among his people.

Ok, eating again.

&gt; Only flesh with its life—its blood—you must not eat.

Another food reference, the previous sentences are ""Every moving animal that is alive may serve as food for you.+ Just as I gave you the green vegetation, I give them all to you""

&gt; 28  For the holy spirit and we ourselves have favored adding no further burden to you except these necessary things: 29  to keep abstaining from things sacrificed to idols, from blood, from what is strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you carefully keep yourselves from these things, you will prosper. Good health to you!”

I expect another relegation fight, anything more than that would be a bonus. Best case scenario is all of our news signing gel together quickly and we get a Top 10 finish, it's evident from the pre-season friendlies that Sam is trying to change the teams style. I expect we'll concede more goals and have less clean sheet but we've hopefully got the firepower to deal with it.


2. Which 3 players should other fans watch out for?

Adrian: Broke into the first team last year after his transfer from Real Betis. I know i'm not alone in hoping he'll be our goalkeeper for many, many years.

Mauro Zarate: A short, technical Argentinian striker, what could possibly go wrong? If he can get into the first team that is.

Aaron Cresswell: The kind of forward thinking fullback we've been crying out for in recent seasons

3. How will the team line up?

GK: Adrian

RB: Demel

CB: Reid &amp; Tomkins

LB: Cresswell

CM: Diame &amp; Noble

And all of the advice has been good. It makes sense to get everything squared away so we know exactly who is liable for what. I was more worried about how the mortgage would work legally since parents are living there, paying towards costs, while not technically under a rental agreement or anything since they are living with the part owner. It's not a buy to let mortgage, but a residential one. But from what I can gather, since one of the owners is living there, it's not an issue. The adviser doesn't seem to think so either.

Do you have a Linkedin profile by the way? Even before I had a job in practice I had recruiters hounding me when I had level 2 AAT listed on my profile. Make sure you flesh out the profile and put down skills you've learned during AAT, view as many profiles of accountants near you as possible as they will get a notification that you looked at them and 9/10 times they'll look at your profile which is basically going to look like a cv!

Cork would get the ball in the same situation, and just turn on the ball away from the defender, or delay hitting the pass, and then play another simple pass, but now because he's got the defender behind him it's very easy to pull off.

Banks will offer savings accounts that aren't as accessibly but have slightly higher interest rates. Usually, a bank will offer a higher interest rate if you make it less accessible to yourself. So some savings accounts you can get a card for, but others you can't. 

There are also ISAs which are good for saving larger sums of money when you deposit it and leave it for a year without touching it, but to be honest I may do more harm than good by going into details because I don't know much. If you go into most banks and building societies, they'll sit down with you and go through it all. They'll definitely try and convince you to bank with them over others so be weary. 

As for your last question, do you mean setting up a direct debit in which you have a fixed amount going from account A to account B at regular intervals? That's certainly legal, and can easily be done with online banking. That's how a lot of people arrange rent payments, for example.

Your best bet is waiting until an employer will fund you through the course in my opinion :)

Did you do A levels? There are A level entry schemes for some of the bigger companies but you usually need to have three B's.

Having no experience is not ideal, but not un-manageable. I honestly think that trying to do a week or two work experience in a very junior role would work wonders for you and could give you a great chance to impress a potential employer, it sucks that doing free work seems to be the only way to get in but it'll pay dividends in the end.

If you'd like me to have a look at your CV and covering letters then I'd be happy to.

I could even knock up a spreadsheet I would use to do a VAT return and company accounts bookkeeping so you could populate it with some fake data and show it to a prospective employer to show you can work through something methodologically as the biggest concern with giving someone with no experience bookkeeping is well.. you get it wrong haha!

Indeed it could also be argued that the current arrangements are unfair to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland what with the majority of MPs being from English constituencies. There are probably instances where UK-wide legislation is passed that may not be in the best interests of the Scottish, welsh or Northern Irish populations but was pushed through by the majority English MPs. All of the above could be solved by four distinct parliaments and a Central, federal government that only caters for the remaining issues that affect everyone, such as military, foreign relations, monetary policy etc.

Also yes the MPs were whipped, so it's 100% down to the parties, but you must agree that it's still a flaw in the system regardless.

Smile, think before you speak, speak clearly (suppress your accent if you have a broad one), show how bright you are, and come with questions about the role. Eye contact, stand up straight, address people by name, firm handshake.

Loss prevention is a good thing to have on your CV. It shows that some cunt was willing to trust you with their livelihood and there's good money in it if you pursue it as a career. Be confident and go for it!

Edit:

Online applications are bullshit. Fill one out, sure, but if the recruitment is store-based and not centrally managed then you'll be *much* better off applying in person. In this case go to the store and ask to see the manager. Firm handshake, etc, etc. Give them your CV and engage them as long as possible without it becoming strained.

I did Chem, Maths, and Physics at A level . I also (foolishly) did Further Maths and Bio at AS Level. I know Chem you need to know to rearrange complex formulas well. Physics if you want to go on to Uni with it, you will need to know basic calculus. Bio at AS is like Chem (rearranging formulas) but I'm sure in the second year you'll go into a lot more statistics stuff. Granted it was 6/5 years ago so things might have changed. 

If I hazard a guess I would say Geology would be like Chem and Environmental Studies like Bio in regards to the maths involved. You don't need to do A-Level Maths, but it helps. I know someone who did Physics, Chem, and History who got into UCL to read Natural Science, he is now starting a PHd. However in the second year he had to take extra (out of school/class) lessons to learn the maths involved. It depends on the support the Sixth Form/College will give.

Do remember that colleges and sixth forms get their funding by having bums on seats. It looks better on them if you go to Uni even if it is not the best option for you.

The increasingly complex global nature of our food supply chain is becoming increasingly vulnerable to disruption. This can come from political instability, natural disaster, or a disruption in the supply of resource or energy inputs needed to secure delivery of produce to the UK.

While we may be a relatively rich country that is able to out-bid others on the global market to allow the consumption demands of our citizens to be met, there are signs that food-exporting and food-importing countries are making exclusive trade arrangements that prevent supplies from reaching the open market. You shouldn't expect the supply of imported abundant, cheap food to continue indefinitely.

During the Iceland ash cloud, delivery of air-freighted fruit and vegetables was interrupted, which led to a shortage of these items in our supermarkets.

For me, the fact that we import 88% of our fruit is shameful, especially considering how pruductive this nation has been in the past. The problem is that most of our traditional home-grown fruit hasn't made the transition well into mass-production, being either too soft, too quick to ripen, or too ugly and irregular to make it onto supermarket shelves.

It's a shame, but stutters can make people uncomfortable or frustrated so minimising that disadvantage should be top priority.

I had a similar situation to you in the summer holidays between then end of school and Uni. I couldn't get a job because I couldn't get the interviews in the first place. The easiest way to get around that is work experience. Go into a busy pub when it's quiet and see if you can get someone to teach you how to pull pints and do cocktails, in exchange for a few weekends of unpaid labour. Go into a cafe and ask to be given ""barista"" (I hate that word. Making coffee's not some kind of science) training and cover a few lunchtimes.

Get that on your CV and you have two of the most valuable (sadly) skills for young people looking for work, and show that you're not some layabout- you've gone out and *secured* experience. Stuff like that can make the difference, even if it's only a few weeks. Hell- maybe if you impress them they'll phone you up and say ""X is sick, can you come in?"".

true,FluxCapacitard,null,null,"I graduated from a Film degree last year, it took me a while to find my feet in the industry but now I'm working on Pan, a feature film by Warner Bros out next year starring Hugh jackman.

If your talking about PA's as personal assistant then that is generally office work.

However.. PA's in the film industry usually refer to 'Production Assistant' and these are the entry level jobs she will need to be going for, if she wants to be on set then look for PA jobs within the Assistant Director department or Camera or Crowd (extras) departments 
The 2 best ways I can suggest getting in as a PA on productions is :

1, Join a film crewing agency (this is the path I took) .. They will usually charge you a joining fee and take £5 for every day they get you work .. now you shouldn't be working as a Production Assistant for less than around £100 daily rate .. so £5 out of that to a agency is peanuts and they will do all the leg work for you and keep you working (you work, they get paid)


2, Research deep into the Internet, call up warner bros UK, call up Ealing studios etc and find out what is going into production soon (there is always something in the pipe works) 
Get in contact with the production office, call them, email them to get yourself onto the crew as a entry level PA on set 

&lt;--EDIT: Not just these studios, these are just examples, every studio you can think of, Also IMDB is good for finding what is in pre-production!--&gt;

There are some agency's that say they will get you work but are pretty lazy, there are also some that purely work as a diary service, you don't want these.. If you want me to suggest some, PM me I'll be happy to help 

Once your in as a PA then it's all about building contacts and who you know to get on the next thing, then it's all networking and moving up the ladder from there .. 

Hope this helps! All the best ",0,1406938514,null,0,1406939471,0,cjeh2ws,t3_2c3dwc,t1_cjeh2ws,t3_2c3dwc,null,1435024182,3,false,UKJobs,t5_2seb3,3

When Russell T. Davies brought back the show, he needed a plot device, something to separate it from the classic series, to make it its own show for new viewers. So he decided to create a mysterious Time War that is referred to but never shown on screen (because it could never live up to the hype). So he removed the Time Lords from the equation and made the Doctor the last of his kind. It's far easier to relate to him that way. Now that we're used to it all, it'd be okay to bring back the Time Lords.

Even the 50th only touched on the last day, after all the worst weapons had been used and both sides were shadows of what they were at the height of the war. The show specifically avoids showing too much of the war because it could never live up to the things you imagine.

Night of the Doctor, the mini-episode featuring McGann does give us an idea for when the Time War happened.

In Yorkshire, and most English counties, the councils already do a damn good job. In the past, the councils had more power. I'd support the councils having more power, similar to what they used to have.

There is no reason to spend massive amounts of money on the Welsh and Irish assemblies when councils similar to those of English counties would work better, be more efficient and be less bloated.

The only problem I can see is the political situation in Northern Ireland.

As for Plaid Cymru in Wales, support for them is at most 10%, usually around 5%, unless it is as a protest vote in the local and/or general elections.

As a Yorkshireman, and i think 99% of my fellow Yorkshire people will agree, I can say that a devolved 'government' for Yorkshire or any other English county would be a complete waste of money, yet another useless layer of Bureaucracy and inefficiency as well as give rise to dangerous regionalism which is not helpful at all.

The funny thing is, the younger generation (according to a study a year or two ago) seem to identify as British first, then the 'nation' then their region.

Its why the nationalist parties are trying to push as hard as they can. The only ones that are being successful are the SNP.

The cornish one is doomed as only 14% (and falling) of Cornwalls population is 'real' Cornish, and as we all know Cornwall is one of the grayest (oldest) countries in the UK, with one of the lowest fertility rates.

Plaid Cymru in Wales only have at most 10% support from the public, most likely less.

Sinn Fein in N-Ireland have about 35-40% following, and it does not seem to be growing.

Even in Scotland, the SNP only enjoys ~20% support from the under 18's, a bit more from the 18-24's and a bit more still from the 25's onwards.

No wonder the SNP are going for a referendum so soon/this year. They are trying to guarantee a yes vote whilst they still can.",0,1406942312,null,0,false,0,cjeinlb,t3_2cbq59,t1_cjeinlb,t1_cjeign8,null,1435024942,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,dapt,null,null,"You're right.  Around yr 2000 the UK arm of the human genome project decided to release their data on a daily basis, by posting it on a publicly accessible website/server.  Their purpose was to stop their competitors from patenting human genome sequences, since once data is publicly available it cannot be patented.

The scene has moved on since then.  EU and US patent laws no longer allow anyone to patent a gene. Instead you have to patent a *use* of the gene, i.e. what you could do with it when it is no longer in a human body. An analogy would be that you cannot patent wood (which is natural), but you can patent something you made out of wood, a clever widget, for example.  Normally there isn't much business you can do with a gene if it is sitting in a test-tube, so patenting genes per se is now very much passé.

So... the principle benefits of this 100,000 genome project to commercial outfits will not be the ability to patent anything that came from an individual person, or a group of people, but to gain the knowledge of which genes should be the focus of their attention.  

Once they know that, they will spend £billions on trying to make drugs that target these particular genes, and patent those they discover and develop. Their patents on drugs will be worthless, however, if the drugs don't work. And if their drugs do work, then presumably it is worth paying for them, and the investment required to produce them.

true,[deleted],null,null,"While I don't entirely agree that the Beeb is pro Isreal, it is pretty startling that the front page of their News website is talking about a missing Isreali soldier. One. 

Around six paragraphs down in the article, it mentions 100 Palestinian civilian deaths in passing. 

Which one should lead the headlines? The gross mass violation of human rights which include 100 dead non-combatants? Or 1 missing combatant? It's also worth noting that on the front page there is no mention of the 100 dead civilians since the ceasefire ended on the front page. 

[Here's a screenshot of the article currently.](http://imgur.com/xGKO2CX)

On the other side of the story the Beeb have compiled some pretty damning stats, such as [this](http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/76680000/gif/_76680046_gaza_deaths_624_latest.gif) pretty disturbing graph showing the death toll by side. It's also showing pretty fucking harrowing pictures of the human cost for the Palestinian citizens that I'd rather not link. 

This is a pretty typical example of how they've been covering it recently, so while it's not outright pro Israeli, it's certainly slightly biased towards them in the way it's presented. People will see the missing soldier headline off to the sidebar of that screenshot. Not the 100 dead civilians in the hours since the ceasefire collapsed. At the same time, those graphs are there for those who actually choose to look into the story, who are probably in the minority.

**NO**

Currently finishing up a short tour in the UK, there right now.

Passport was stamped ""No work or public assistance""     
the second part is paraphrased, the ""no work"" is an exact quote.

I was busking also, and that would only make matters worse if that income were relied on.

Wish you well, suggest the Cardiff, Wales School or Music, Art and Drama.   
(not the exact name)     
The London area would also fit you well. 

There are many nonUK people working here,    
the ones I meant are hard working and      
come from countries that have much less opportunities.   
Didn't ask if they were legal.

Wish you well.

Buy a couple of shirts from somewhere more upmarket than Primark. Send flowers to your girlfriend's work address.

The fact that you're asking this question suggests that this is your first (decent) payrise, so you're probably fairly young as well. Just enjoy it.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;As for the reason these players aren't getting the chances they might have gotten elsewhere... I covered this somewhere else. It's the same reason we have one of the best academies in Europe but don't seem to promote many players to senior level. We don't have the luxury of taking time, and bringing them through alongside top players where they can develop in a relatively safe environment. We don't have a danger room, we throw them straight into fights with sentinels. 

I don't agree with this (though I don't know the context in which your comment was made). Lambert's clear philosophy was to blood in good young players with the ""if they're good enough, they're old enough"" mentality when he first came. 

That first season he signed a bunch of youngsters and threw them straight in (Westwood, Benteke, Bennett, Lowton, even Bowery). He then introduced Delph and Weimann as well. Problem he faced was actually, half these players will never make the grade.

I've been a Villa supporter all my thirty years of existence and I can't remember a manager brave enough and one who trusts our YTS enough to bring them through. That's the real problem. We have had a huge proportion of outstanding YTS players and almost to a tee, they all fail to make the grade. Why is that? You look around at other clubs - don't even look at the likes of Man U, Arsenal or Liverpool - look at NUFC, Sunderland, Southampton - every year they trust the best of their YTS to come in and do their job. 

We have some outstanding YTS midfielders - in particular Daniel Johnson and Gary Gardner (both of which are in their twenties now) and neither have been given any sort of chance. Both Johnson and Gardner are so comfortable on the ball - I'd love to see them either side of Westwood and see what they could do. Will it happen? Not a chance. Joe Cole is the answer (and it could have been another 31 year old in January - Hoolahan).",0,1406951829,null,0,false,0,cjemk9e,t3_2c9l71,t1_cjemk9e,t1_cjdt7tr,null,1435027172,1,false,avfc,t5_2s569,1

My hypothesis is that, with the Time Lord and Gallifrey gone, the  Doctor's regenerations have gotten a little out of control - like trying to fix a broken arm while stuck out in the bush as opposed to a hospital - and that's why they sometimes have such damaging and unexpected effects.  It fits with the classic series too - Romana's ""decision"" to regenerate into body that looked like person she had previous seen*, and the Time Lords forcing the regen from Two to Three.

true,panachetag,lfcflame,,"&gt; Basically what I'm saying is that, do be optimistic but just exercise patience and critical thought. I would like to point out that the team WILL need time and I'm hoping to point it out now so that we don't get on their backs if the early results don't start coming our ways. The biggest thing the team will need, in probably our most testing season is unwavering support. As always, You'll Never Walk Alone!

Very much agree with this. I think the points you've made are valid, but I feel like they won't be a *huge* issue to deal with.

1) Our backline was rubbish last year and effectively relied on individual ability, so I don't think we're likely to go backwards on that this season. 

2) I don't think we really struggled against teams that sat deep against us last season, did we? Chelsea can do it because they have enough 20-30m players that Mourinho can force it on them and bin the ones who don't like it. Other clubs tend to not have the personnel to do it effectively.

3) Agree with this. I do expect Brendan to start the season with a very similar squad to last season's, though, with maybe 1-2 players changed. I imagine he'll introduce new signings as subs for the first few matches and try to incorporate them into the first team after 2-3 sub appearances if there aren't any issues with team chemistry.",0,1406964452,null,0,false,0,cjeqif2,t3_2cep5f,t1_cjeqif2,t3_2cep5f,null,1435029039,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

The purpose of preseason is to prepare for the coming season and get all the players fully fit. Increasingly, clubs put this aside for commercial reasons and fly to all corners of the globe in lame attempts to gain new fans in foreign 'markets'.

Never mind that your players have to suffer significant jet lag, and don't even get the basics like playing on reasonable playing surfaces - putting your players as risk of injury.

Who can forget the joke that was the tournament in Beijing last year:

I would recommend finding someone who is an experienced on road cyclist to escort you and explain potential dangers; do a bikeability course and try the route out on a Sunday morning when it's quieter. 

Edit - a helmet is a personal choice but I would highly recommend it. Also, lights, some superbright LEDs can be useful even in the day (and required at night) and if you can afford it, get some bulletproof puncture resistant tyres (eg Schwalbe Marathon Plus)... They don't guarantee anything but they reduce the likelihood.

You can get 5% with the TSB current account up to £2000 as long as you pay in £500 a month. Much better than the poxy 0.75%.

ISAs are rather pointless [for most people] at the moment if you ask me, unless there's a particular reason you need it to be sheltered from tax (example: You're saving for your child's future and being tax free would benefit you long term) However, I do have £100 a month going in to one at 2.33% with Nationwide but I only use it to separate my other savings which I currently use Lloyds Club Saver at 4%.

If you sell your house, you'll have to buy another one, and the one you buy will cost more too.

Most other costs related to buying and selling houses are linked to the price.  For example, stamp duty and estate agents fees are usually a percentage of the house price, so you only lose there if houses cost more.

The only people who benefit are people who are trading down, and those who are dying (and hence don't need a new house).

So the entire premise of the linked article is bogus.  If you are lucky enough to own a house now, the fact that it is rising in price is not beneficial to you at all.  Your ""earnings"" are entirely fictional.  The people who moved out of London would have been able to do that anyway, even if house prices were not rising, and they'd have saved on the fixed costs in the process.

In a country with thousands of years of history and surrounded by other countries with thousands years of history; I can see no benefit in studying the history of a brief country that is already on the decline.

&gt; can't fully appreciate British history without engaging in the history of elsewhere.

A great deal of history is about war: The thousands of years of warring with European nations (especially France) would trump any of the small trifles (such as the Treason in the Colonies conflict or the Triumph of 1812) with a nation that has been around for about 5 minutes.

Important historical figures or time periods are also studied in History class: The US doesn't have anyone person of great global importance in its short history, nor any important time periods. There's no Alexander the Great, Julius Casear, Genghis Khan, Pharaohs, Tsars. No great Empire like the Romans, The Mongols, Britain etc. No great revolution brought to the table like Democracy in Greece, Industrial Revolution in Britain or even a daft one like Communism in early 20th century Russia.

You'll get used to the commute.  I was doing the same salary job for 45mins-1hr in traffic each way during the M6 J10-J6 roadworks in 2012-2013 and you don't think about it eventually.  But your distance might be much longer (I was doing 35 mile round trip/day) so the petrol cost could be higher.

That being said, I've done well at that job and have a much higher salary now, plus the roadworks have gone so the journey time has dropped to 20-30mins each way now.  Obviously the M25 isn't going to speed up for you, but the money certainly could. Plus 5% could mean an extra £500/yr or £5000 - we don't know.

Generally speaking, you'd need about 3-6 months of credit history for small checks - mobile phone SIM only contract, house rental, insurance,  shitty credit card.

For bigger credits (bank overdraft, normal credit card, smartphone with mobile phone contract) you need about 1 year-2 years.

For great/cashback credit cards, personal loans, mortgages you would need at least 3 years of good credit.

A good way to start 

1. get on the electoral roll as soon as you have an address
2. open a bank account
3. get an energy bill on your name
4. you can usually get a 30-day ""rolling contract"" mobile without a credit check, but it still counts in you credit file
5. get a ""bad credit"" card - namely Vanquis or Aqua - usually you can get one with a £500 limit and about 40% interest rate right away
6. always pay your bills

And I didn't say Suarez was the best ever No.7 at Anfield, just that he is quite possibly the most talented No.7 to pass through.

He also became the first player to score double digits in a single month IIRC, and I don't think anyone since Henry led the league in both assists and goals.

To try to keep this short I'll just number your paragraphs and then include a response. I'm not interested in some grand debate, and I'm sure you're not either.

1. America - or at least the land itself, if not the USA - *does* have thousands of years of history. The Native Americans/indigenous peoples arrived there a hell of a long time before the Romans invaded Britain, for example. Distinct N. A. cultures have existed for over 10,000 years.

2. A great deal of history is about war, but a great deal isn't. Cities like Glasgow and Manchester were built on the back of the transatlantic slave trade, and the cotton trade between the American South and Britain was instrumental in prolonging the institution of slavery in the Southern states. The history of the two countries is intertwined by more than just war. I do note, however, the conspicuous absence of the World Wars in your list, and the vast sums of money given to the UK by the US after the war. Modern day Britain owes a lot America for that.

3. The works and ideas of Thomas Jefferson were incredibly important in the French Revolution, and the American model of democracy has been imitated throughout the world, despite it's short history. FDR defied Congress and broke laws to drag America into WWII, and was assisting the Allies even when the US was technically neutral. The Cold War - perhaps the only post-War ""event"" of truly worldwide significance - had the US at its heart. I'd hazard a guess that more people around the world could name the first US President than could name the first UK Prime Minister, while Abraham Lincoln is probably more recognisable than most PMs. And that's not just because of ""American TV and Movies"", but because they were involved in some of the most significant events of the last couple of hundred years.

So we quickly go 1-0 up through Balotelli and then we have to wait around for the next goal in what should have been a stroll in the park for the team. mid way through the second half and Salzburg decide to make a sub and who do they bring on? ALAN. A Brazilian named fucking ALAN, obviously a nickname along the lines of Fred but the home crowd to just ran with it, mainly out of boredom.

The chants varied all night from ""Alan, Alan, give us a wave, Alan, give us a wave."" and ""Alan is superman, Alan is superman""all the way through to ""Stand up if you love Alan"". It sparked somewhat of a love affair with the player leading to people etching his name in the snow and I think even a few people got his name printed on a kit. 

It was just a bit of fun really but Alan, being the great guy that he obviously is, decided to thank the fans in attendance for their support.

Even if no defensive coordinator emerges (which I can't see not happening), I hope that most of our defensive woes last season came down to being forced to play Kolo (who I couldn't stay mad at for the time it took the ball to cross the goal line) and Sakho and Kolo being new signings.

true,JRugman,null,null,"After the second world war there was a strong push to become more self-sufficient, following the experiences of having to depend on food imported via convoy to feed the wartime population.

The strategy taken was to focus on maximising production of staple goods - beef, milk, lamb, eggs, barley, wheat, oats, rye, potatoes, sugar beet, and wool. Farming was modernised, becoming highly mechanised and dependent on new synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. This boosted production in these products, but it also introduced ecological problems, undermined rural communities, and led to a decline in products that weren't seen as strategically important or commercially viable. Local varieties disappeared, to be replaced by standard cheese, standard egg, standard cow, etc.

More recently, there's been a recognition that a sustainable UK agricultural sector needs diversity in local ecologies and economies. The state guarantees provided during the post-war period have mostly stopped, putting a lot of farmers into a much more difficult financial position. A few years of bad prices will generally put a farm out of business, as has been particularly evident in the pork and dairy sectors.

UK agricultural policy is now much more market based. As you said, as a comparatively wealthy nation, we have the money to afford to import the food we need. But that's assuming that there will always be enough food available for us to buy from overseas, at a cost that we can afford.

When global food prices spiked in 2007-2008, the cost of food in the UK went up on average by 15% - for some items as much as 40%. Our increasing dependence on global food systems mean that we are vulnerable to factors that affect the production of food globally. Increased risks to food production from climate change, increasing energy costs, changing patterns of food consumption in developing economies, and a rising global population mean that the availability of cheap, abundant food should not be taken for granted. The more we can do to support domestic food production, the less exposure we have to future global food crises.",0,1406974919,null,0,false,0,cjesgz9,t3_2cdiej,t1_cjesgz9,t1_cjemtxs,null,1435029956,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,likeafuckingninja,null,null,"I personally transferred from a completely different department internally at the company i already worked in.

My first job dealt with arranging collecting freight from an airport and then distributing it around to our branches around the company. The job I do now I work in one of those branches dealing directly with one of our accounts customs clearing and organising delivery of their freight.

To my knowledge the best way to get the experience is to do the job...

Unlike say customer service skills that are fairly transferable between industries freight skills are transferable for freight companies.

That said I'm pretty sure I got my job because of the five years I did in a customer service dealing with unhappy customers - Freight is generally staffed by people who are very good at their jobs but crappy at dealing with customers because they've never had to. So the fact I didn't have quite right the experience was balanced by the fact they were also looking for someone who could keep the customer happy when stuff when wrong. 

So it all helps, sometimes it is about personalising your CV so it applies to the industry you're trying to find work in.

I would say the easiest way into the industry is to be willing to take a crappy shift for less pay than someone else, then when you have the experience, look for a job that suits you. Night shifts are usually understaffed, and although the better paying jobs are usually in exports, imports are more willing to take untrained staff and train them, then transfer you to exports. 
You can start out in the warehouse but it's very easy to get stuck there, as the warehouse skills and office skills are not related at all, BUT it will get you a security certificate which is a big plus when applying to freight jobs.

Try reed, and rather than applying directly to companies use an agency, there are hundreds of companies around an airport that you would never ever know of that an agency would and they will help tailor your application.

In all honesty I fell into my job by accident, it was never an industry I looked at and went 'I must work there' but it's stable work, and if you end up at the right company it can be a lot of fun.",0,1406975037,null,0,false,0,cjesho4,t3_29yzpr,t1_cjesho4,t1_cjeezqk,null,1435029966,6,false,UKJobs,t5_2seb3,6

true,ddosn,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"""England isn't homogenous enough""

Yes, it is. The only parts of England that are the exception are Yorkshire and Cornwall.

""or different enough from the UK as a whole of which it is most of, for a single Parliament to work.""

Yes, it is. An English parliament would work, far better than regionalist parliaments, which would be extremely expensive and give rise to regionalism, which would bring no benefits whilst simultaneously caused a shit load of problems.

""Regional devolution, on the other hand, means each region gets what it wants, brings power closer to local people, and actually would do something.""

*That's what local councils are for, you dimwit!*

Devolution on a county scale would be an extremely expensive waste of time. If you want local areas to be able to run themselves more independent of the central government, just give the councils more powers as it used to be about 120 or so years ago.

There is absolutely no reason to add yet another layer of expensive government Bureaucracy that would do nothing except cost massive amounts of money that the UK just doesn't have. An expansion of the public sector like that would just lead to USSR levels of inefficiency and confusion. Its a socialist wet dream, but a realists nightmare.

But the whole point is mute anyway as every county has already voted no with a no vote of over 90% at least three times in the last 50 years, so this is not even on the table. Further compounded by the Yorkshire First party that wanted a Yorkshire assembly getting next to no votes in the last local elections.",0,1406975553,null,0,1406975931,0,cjeskom,t3_2cbx15,t1_cjeskom,t1_cjejaph,null,1435030005,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

then you factor in the tax per year for PETROL &amp; DIESEL

The government made it clearly cheaper for a Diesel car and made it so buying a Petrol was a financially stupid decision.  
So don't come on here saying here here, because people changed because its expensive to live and diesel was cheaper.

We have just received two new vans at work both diesel because of tax laws and you can't buy a petrol van any ways, so really don't come on here saying people who drive diesel deserve what they get when clearly the last 7 years the petrol driver has been getting a kick in and now the governments changed it's mind and is gonna beat on the diesel driver for the next 7 years.

Or just have a wander about and take pics of anything you like, then ask at UpFest or on here if you want to identify the artist.

EDIT to add - as regards budget, garage doors aren't that big so +/-£100 would easily cover the necessary paint and cider and leave some to pay for the artist's time. You could get someone doing it for less, it all depends on the artist really. Graffiti &amp; street art styles vary a lot so where one artist could do a garage door in a half hour, another more intricate style might take half a day.

Here are some tips that might help you stay safe, by knowing what's happening around you:

* Get yourself in position early and make your intentions clear: look around, use your arms to indicate clearly
* Look out for vehicles turning left, or pulling out in front of you; try to catch eyes with drivers so you know they've seen you
* Watch indicator lights (though these aren't infallible) and changes in the angles of front wheels
* Be aware of upcoming junctions, and where there is space on the road in front of the vehicles around you to help you anticipate what they might do

Apart from that, do your best to stay in a good mood!

OP, I think the choice you have to make is a personal one. Do you actually want a job, now, or in the future? If it's a Yes to that, then phone your boss, apologise for the delay (cite having some personal issues as your reason), and say you'll be in as soon as possible.  Do what you need to do today, and on Monday, discuss your other concerns, and explain to him how it'll be an advantage to him if he authorizes the purchase of new equipment. 

If it's a No, then continue pretty much as you are. Your attitude and your history will absolutely sink you in future, and you'll be practically unemployable, even for entry-level jobs. 

If you do go for the latter, at least be a decent person, and let your boss know that you won't be coming back. Drop him a text then block his number, if you must. I'd strongly recommend you go with the former, though. A life on the dole is no fun, and you could have it so much better if you persevered, got over these hurdles, and climbed the ladder.

One thing to consider is that before people have seizures, it's not uncommon for them to become confused and disoriented. Some people can get aggressive when they get confused.

They are, but you also have to remember the nature of a police persons job is that in most cases, they've been given a reason to assume a person is in the wrong (e.g. they've been called by someone saying there's an argument or a fight).

Recently the first application for a position was received in less than 1 minute from the Indeed job specification being approved and going on-line, so that particular applicants clearly hadn't even had time to properly read the job application, let alone craft a proper application or cover letter. The vast, vast majority of applications appeared to just be job-seekers attempting to satisfy their quota of applying for x jobs per week. Some of the CV's are laughable.

So my recommendation to you is that if you find anything on Indeed that you fancy applying for then try and make your application stand out and applicable to the company you're applying for and also submit your application via the companies website/email/post, otherwise you're just a single name in a long list of dole-wallahs on Indeeds employer facing portal.",0,1406981350,null,0,false,0,cjetl3e,t3_2cf0tz,t1_cjetl3e,t1_cjetaq7,null,1435030482,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

You stand up, say, 'Call an ambulance' and they go and do that while you administer first aid.

*Yahaya has a particular move in his arsenal that’s left opponents completely unable to cope. “It’s a gift from God, I think,” Yahaya said about his special move, where he dips his shoulder before bolting, like a lightning strike, the other way with the ball. It’s a simple feint, but that’s no comfort for the poor defender, who’s left rooted to the ground like the desert palm trees of UAE. “It just comes naturally to me and I don’t really even plan to do it.”*

A 999 call requires a series of answers about the patient, something an usher standing by a landline at the exits of the theatre wouldn't have. This would mean giving the 999 operator less information, and jeopardising the patient. 

Say, for example, someone starts having a violent seizure in the audience. In the current circumstances, the person sitting next to them, likely a person who knows them, will be able to call an ambulance, accurately describe what the patient is doing, and be able to tell the 999 operator if they have any medical conditions that could lead to a seizure. This would mean the paramedics have a better idea of the situation they're turning up to, and can prepare treatments/ prioritise the ambulance depending on that. 

In your scenario, the usher wouldn't be able to accurately describe what the patient is doing, and wouldn't be able to tell the 999 operator if the patient has any past medical conditions, bar shouting across the room. This means the paramedics will arrive with less information, putting the patient at more risk.

It doesn't seem that Israel is being very discriminating in what they shoot at, but Hamas isn't being discriminatory at all; they just shoot at the biggest populated area they can find. They want this conflict; the reason they're able to fire hundreds of rockets a week is because they've been stockpiling them across Gaza for months for exactly this purpose. They shoot from the roofs of populated areas because they know the worlds media will only condemn Israel when they shoot back.

I'm not defending Israel here, but I'm trying to make the point that blaming the entire situation on them doesn't help matters. There's no point in pressuring Israel to have a cease fire if Hamas won't respect it or don't want it.

To find a way forward we need to be clear what we're asking Israel to do in a situation where Hamas won't (or perhaps even can't) stop shooting rockets. Do we simply want them to provide proportional-force to disarm the militants, almost in parental fashion?

true,layendecker,crest-new,OLD CREST 4EVA,"&gt; Giroud is capable of 20 a year, he's just a little bit too susceptible to the vagaries of form that plague so many strikers

He may well be, but how many chances would he need for this? His conversion rate is laughable, especially on sitters.. The amount of clear cut opportunities he missed last season is unforgivable, and even if he converted 50% of them, Arsenal may have been right up there at the death... But he is a second rate goalscorer. 

&gt;I'm not entirely certain they need one

I think you are wrong. When a team looking to win the league has to look at 90 points as a realistic target, having top quality in every position is vital- and the goalscoring position is the most important on the pitch. Not having a goalscorer up top gives the opposition get of of jail free cards they otherwise wouldn't have, and with organised, well drilled sides defending for their life... One get out of jail free card might be all they need.

&gt; Chelsea came within four points of winning the league, and their top scorer had had 14

They didn't win the league though, despite having the best defence (10 goals conceded less any anyone else) and the best attacking midfield in the country. If they had a goalscorer, they probably would have got those 5 points they needed to win the league, but without one they pretty much peaked (as Mourinho said). 

&gt;It's not a requirement if your midfielders pick up the slack, and the more people you have who are goal threats, the harder it is to stop them all.


This seems contradictory. Surely the biggest goal threat is the striker, and therefore the most important, and most difficult to stop. ",0,1406985820,null,0,false,0,cjeuldq,t3_2cc5sp,t1_cjeuldq,t1_cjeu447,null,1435031058,3,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,3

I mean something doesn't offend me so anyone it does upset needs to man the fuck up. It's just as bad as when they stopped us from labelling paint colours as ""nigger brown"", I mean it wasn't meant racist so why did we have to change it? It was just a description. I mean I have no problem with people with mental problems so why can't I say words that they find offensive? Maybe different people have different experiences which means things affect them more or less than the average person, maybe this is normal and maybe what matters isn't the reasoning behind something but the fact that someone is caused severe upset and distress. Even if the reasons are illegitmate it doesn't mean we shouldn't be considerate and change things that can be changed, and help the ""sufferer"" deal with things that can't, or are too ingrained, to change. Nah just fucking with you much easier to just assume my perspective and emotional experiences are all that's relevant. Stupid mentally ill people getting upset by certain words, it's almost like their brains don't work right, fucking idiots. 

But seriously the 'brainstorm' thing isn't even comparable because a) I was joking b) even if I was serious then the reasoning behing why people shouldn't say brainstorm isn't the same as the reason people shouldn't ask stupid question that answer themselves. 

Honestly I was just making a joke but now I really think you sound like a twat, as I do with anybody who makes stupid ""counter-points"" along the lines of ""oh you'll want me to stop saying Christmas next"" or whatever.",0,1406987181,null,0,1406987416,0,cjeuygg,t3_2cbxft,t1_cjeuygg,t1_cjeusjs,null,1435031231,0,false,BritishSuccess,t5_2vlyo,0

&gt;

&gt;__Elastic therapeutic tape__ is an elastic cotton strip with an acrylic adhesive that is used for treating athletic injuries and a variety of physical disorders.

&gt;There is little scientific evidence that elastic therapeutic taping produces *clinically significant benefits*. See Criticism.

There's some glitch in City's time zone calculations when imported into EITHER iCal or Google Calendars. I had the same problem with both.

But, once these teams return to Europe, the fixture times are converting correctly for me (EST).

EDIT: Proof. These times are in EST, but the games for the Int. Champ. Cup should actually be EST, but they're still converting to 5 hours earlier. But you can see that they're correct once City returns to the League.

I've owned two diesel cars.  While they were certainly a bit less heavy on my pocket, I don't think I'll buy another.  I'm overtaken all the time by diesels, when I'm cycling.  The smell is horrible, a kind of dry, offensive stench that gets in your head and hurts.

In the QPR game he allowed the vocal and partizan support to referee the game, gave the softest penalty I've ever seen given, allowed Ferdinand to elbow JT in the head, sent off Torres when he'd been fouled and IMHO in having no control of the game it led to unwarranted frustration on the part of the players which ultimately led to the JT racism row. 
The Villa away game was much the same , the crowd ran the match and subsequently the Villa players were given carte Blanche to do whatever they wanted, tackle as hard and late as they wanted, which again led to Ramires getting sent off , again, unfairly in my opinion, nobody seemed interested in the fact that Ramires did not tackle anyone, he was running with the ball when the Villa player slid in at great pace and with no care whether he put Ramires into the stands, Ramires sneakily leaves his leg in to get his own back, the Villa players acts like he's been disemboweled, Lambert enters the pitch , Agbonlahor enters the pitch and punches Ramires , Mourinho enters the pitch is sent off whilst nothing is done about Villas part in it all.
Foy at best is a ""homer"" at worst he's unfit for purpose and should be struck off for directly causing more problems than he stops.

It does highlight a growing problem of modern undesirables trying to make memorials to past traumatic events or the dead all about them.

The 'UVF' hijacked the parade to the historical UVF by having their own members in it with armbands showing what part of the modern UVF they were in. 

Dissident republicans seem to be hijacking the internment and hunger strike memorial parades, and we're probably going to see this problem crop up in a big way on the nationalist side when the 1916 memorials begin.

Disgraceful all round I'd say, and it mocks the sacrifices and injustices that said memorials are meant to highlight.

Of course, while all the unionists are going with their 'graduated response' to restrictions on a single orange parade and refusing to have talks on dealing with the past, we're just going to have to put up with this shit for the time being, it seems.",0,1406989299,null,0,false,0,cjevknw,t3_2cf4bn,t1_cjevknw,t3_2cf4bn,null,1435031503,9,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,9

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Non of what you posted is pro-Isreal and i'm positive the 100 Palestine deaths were reported on BBC News broadcasted all over the world numerous times.

These are recent deaths. At the time of me posting that reply that headline had remained as such for several hours with the Palestinian deaths being reported afterwards. Well, the number being updated in scores.


&gt;Or do you just mean their online posts? 

This is my personal perception of their online and radio coverage.


&gt;They reported the captured soldier because it was news, and a war crime by the side that most people are feeling for, it really is a headline/front page story. 

A POW isn't a war crime, provided they are treated right. (Nevermind the fact the reports haven't been confirmed), the wilful, repeated, intentional killing of civvies though...



&gt;Generally an article will start with the newest details and then add a little bit of the background further down the post, which is exactly what they did. 

Nope, not in that case. Right now they're actually really going to town on that missing soldier. Even got a wee Facebook picture they keep showing. Shame they don't have photogenic dead civvies to show. A bit if rubble here and there but *look at this missing soldier*, that's what these new air strikes are about. I was watching BBC news as I was writing this and the photo has shown up twice so far for extended periods of time. They also leave out the details of how Israeli settlers work except in the most bare minimum details sometimes but let's skip past that real quick.



&gt;The BBC journalists are out there risking their lives to give a report so that we can know what's happening. 

Interesting that pro-Palestinian angles are being relegated to the Statesman

http://www.newstatesman.com/world-affairs/2014/07/jeremy-bowens-gaza-notebook-i-saw-no-evidence-hamas-using-palestinians-human

While the headline of this decries the exact opposite of what Bowens says

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-28394606

Remember, my personal problem is especially the way they are presenting headlines. This is a prime example of this. 


&gt;Standing outside the BBC saying they are corrupt or whatever the message is is a bit on an insult to them to be fair.

Guess we shouldn't protest at Stormont when we're pissed about something either. Protesting is good, protesting is fine. Protesting is a natural thing to happen in a government and in orgs that are associated with a government. 

Was I at the protest? No. Do I think the BBC are doing a bad job? No, not as bad as they could be doing. I'm just focusing in on the negatives of their reporting for the purpose of making a point. Will I continue to use them? Yes.

1. Very little of this is well documented. Compared to the Romans et al this is a waste of time to teach.

2. Your first part is the history of economics, I can't see that working well in a year 7 classroom, can you?   
Your second part is about WORLD war 1 &amp; 2. Emphasis on WORLD. The US played a large part in the Pacific front, but in Britain we focus on the European front (closer to home) and we all know that the European front was won with British intelligence, American money and Russian blood. The yanks were just making up the numbers in the actual fighting. With regards to the vast sums of money that the yanks forced Britain to borrow in their darkest hour - hardly interesting stuff and can be covered in under twenty minutes of any history lesson below undergraduate level.

3. The American model of democracy? Don't make me laugh. Funny how of the countries in the 1st world most copied the British system or mixed and matched many countries' (including but not limited to the US) system to fit their needs and developed their own style of government.   
The only reason that people know American history so well is because of movies and TV. If Canada had had the entertainment industry complex in the last 50 years, we'd be dismissing Jim Lahey instead of George Washington.   
I fail to see anything accomplished by an American president was ""some of the most significant events of the last couple of hundred years"" with the possible exception of JFK averting nuclear war. All the ""great"" things they did were only significant in America.

In summary, the history of the US is of very little interestof pertinence to your average UK schoolchild and is pointless being taught.

1. The guy's got 12.4k followers, and only 138 tweets. So, it's obviously another account that's deleted all it's tweets and had a name-change.

2. To find the source of any image, you just gotta right-click it and hit 'google search this image' (good way of finding out if a ""OMG X IS HERE FOR HIS MEDICAL"" or ""OMG HERE IS Y IN TOWN"" are real) - well, all that shows up in the search bar is 'nbc sports network logo', so it's probably just a stock photo of some schmuck with the NBC logo shopped onto it.

3. Why the fuck would someone from NBC know about a ground-braking transfer, and absolutely nobody else in the world? - which, if you think about it is a pretty good plan from the person behind the fake account; previous fake accounts that tweet football transfers have usually been ousted by whichever company they claim to work for (usually BBC or Guardian or whoever), so, with it being NBC who hardly give a shit about football - at least compared to american football or baseball - nobody's likely gonna come out and 'out' the account.

true,chamber37,,Joe le Tactics,"&gt; I don't agree with this (though I don't know the context in which your comment was made). Lambert's clear philosophy was to blood in good young players with the ""if they're good enough, they're old enough"" mentality when he first came. 

I'd dispute that. For a start, that's irresponsible management. Throwing a bunch of youngsters out together with no-one to guide them isn't the same as ""blooding youngsters"". Even when Sir Alex did it at Man Utd, he supplemented with experience. That's how it's supposed to go. And that, as I mentioned [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/avfc/comments/29r3l3/paul_lambert_things_will_start_to_happen_after/cinyf60), is the difference between our talented youngsters and the ones breaking through at ""bigger"" clubs.

IIRC, the original context was to counter the argument that the young players he criticised (i.e. the ones not getting a fair crack of the whip, as I put it) were not good enough, and that's why they weren't getting into the team. I think that's a flawed argument. How can you tell if a player is good enough if you judge him only on training/reserve games or a couple of first team appearances? You haven't got enough data to accurately assess his ability in the situations you need to know his ability in. I'm not saying this approach is entirely wrong, but with young players it's a lot harder to tell. There's room for improvement etc etc.

You're right when you say Lambert has the ""if they are good enough"" mentality, but he also recognises, like any good manager would, that you still can't just expect them to do well straight away, without the correct support. That's part of why he defended them so much last season, and kept affirming his belief in them. Even now, the players he has signed aren't really ""replacements"" for these guys. At least not long-term, anyway.

If you look back to when we have successfully graduated young players, there have always been talented, experienced heads around them to help them along. Gareth Barry (arguably our most successful youth product of the past 15 years) came through in a team with Southgate, Ehiogu, Taylor, Merson and Dublin. Five established Premier League players, four of whom played for England. Under O'Neill, we had guys like Young, Milner and Agbonlahor developing alongside experienced players like Petrov, Barry, Dunne and Carew. There is always supposed to be a balance.

Right now, I think our players with the most Premier League experience are actually Agbonlahor, Bent and Delph. While they are all talented, not one of these is a player I'd want mentoring a youngster. Guys like Richardson and Cole... maybe not spectacular players, but extremely positive influences for our younger players because of their experience. Much like Vlaar has been. And pointing out that Johnson and Gardner are in their twenties doesn't change my argument. They are both still eligible for the under 21s, for crying out loud. Players peak at 27-29 usually. At 21-23, when they can still play for the under 21s, they're not expected to be done developing. That's why they can play for the under 21s, lol. I've said this a few times on this sub but England's obsession baffles me.

There are also plenty examples of players being allowed to leave a club too early, and going on to become much better than anticipated. Gary Cahill was allowed to leave Villa for 5m because O'Neill didn't think he was good enough to take playing time from Collins or Dunne. Look at him now. Andrea Pirlo was 22 when Milan signed him. He'd played 22 times over three years for Inter, who sold him (admittedly for 17m euro, but they still sold him) because they didn't think he was good enough to get into their first team. Now he's one of the best midfielders in the world.

I know we're not really in the best position to be exercising patience and whatnot, but don't write these guys off just yet. With the right players around them, I have faith that it will all come together. For some of them, at least. Of the seven you named, I'd argue only Bowery definitely wasn't good enough, Bennett probably isn't either, but Lowton could do alright, and the others are quite clearly good enough to play in the Premier League. ""Half"" is a bit harsh, IMO. Sure, some of these kids won't make it at Villa (like Barry Bannan, or Nathan Delfouneso for example) but some will. No academy has a particularly good graduation rate. Not even Man Utd or Barcelona. Their players end up elsewhere (and for reference, we have as many academy products playing in Europe's top five leagues as Juventus... not bad company, IMO).

Maybe I'm too optimistic, I dunno. But I've coached youth players for nine years now. And I've seen dramatic changes in the space of a year, when things just ""click"". Maybe that's affecting my judgment. I just don't think we should be saying players under 25 aren't good enough.

In a polite letter/e-mail, apologize for the tantrum, and explain the circumstances surrounding it. In doing this you're making sure the owner/manager is fully aware of the situation, and hopefully prompt them to consider better ways of handling similar situations in future.

No one likes asking customers to leave, especially the boss, and even more so if it can be avoided.

As front of house for a pub/restaurant, if I was presented with this situation, I'd have given you some time to try and sort it out at the table, while catching the eye of other customers and making sympathetic faces and whispering sorry.

I couldn't let it go on for very long though. Certainly after a couple of minutes, I'd have no choice to but to suggest how nice our beer garden is, and that I can probably have the kitchen keep your food warm.

Now I don't know how the restaurant handled it, or what capacity they have to handle it better. I don't know what set the tantrum off, and whether they could have done something to avoid it.

But a polite letter will be better received than a bad review. They know you could write a bad review. They made the decision to take that bad review when they asked you to leave. They decided one bad review from you, was better than several bad reviews from other people.

true,thedingoismybaby,cnty-uk,No luck catching them swans then?,"The device would record a drive stun. It would count as ""used"" and would be recorded as such. I didn't go into ""drive stun"" for that reason as I count it along with firing the barbs. 

The only thing I am not sure on is whether it would record being turned on.

Officially the officer should have completed a form even if only drawn however

&gt;Every time a taser is used in some capacity (fired, angle-drive stun, drive stun, red dot, arced, aimed or drawn) a record of its ‘highest use’ is made by the police officer and a short form is completed.

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/police-use-of-taser-statistics-england-and-wales-2012-to-2013/police-use-of-taser-statistics-england-and-wales-2012-to-2013

With the big issue around Taser in the UK at the moment I'd suggest an officer would be unlikely not to record an incident if it was needed, especially if not actually fired and with that many potential witnesses. Of course facts may be different and that is what an investigation is for.

**Edit:** Turns out it will record only trigger activations so not if drawn and turned on but would definitely show if drive stunned or fired

&gt;The Taser X26 currently in use with the Police in the UK records the time, date, duration,
battery percentage and battery temperature for the last two thousand trigger activations

Arsenal - Sanchez. Because fuck Arsenal. Or Gibbs, just because there's no one else from them I'd take/we need.

Everton - Assuming I don't take Gibbs from Arsenal and take Sanchez instead, I'd take Coleman and move Azpilicueta to the left. Azpi LB, Coleman RB.

I have Henderson, sterling and sturridge, because I think of the rest of the mid sterling is most likely to start, and play high up the pitch. Coutinho looks immense, but he's more likely I think to be playing the pass before the assist than the assist pass, if he plays further back, which he most likely will. Sturridge will lead the line so he will have plenty of chances. I'd have went with a defender but it's so hard to know who is first choice atm, the only one to go for really would be mignolet, and I'd rather wait a while and see the shape of the team before I rely on the defence for too many points!

This 18 year old will highly be unlikely to emigrate to work to any of those places. If your stories are true, the people moving will be highly skilled and educated individuals. There is no other way to move to the US.

Carlton looking up for it, with what little service he's had in 15mins.

Carlton suffering a serious case of Big Striker Syndrome at the moment as the ref blows for a foul every time he gets the ball under control.

And I don't know, I think political correctness is fine, the way it is enforced is the problem. 

So in your example, I agree, words shouldn't be banned/punished however that doesn't mean people shouldn't show a little compassion and respect. It isn't because they are disabled, it is because they are human beings. Blanket bans on words are stupid, expecting individuals to show a bit of tact is reasonable. It isn't giving them special treatment because I'd try to show the same amount of tact and compassion with anyone, it is just that in the case of someone suffering from a dsiablity you can make a safe bet that saying somethign controversial or insulting about disablities will be a sensitive area. Obviously sometimes it is ok to offend people, for example in a debate about a sensitive topic but some people seem to think they have a right to say whatever they want, whenever they want. And it doesn't matter if they needlessly offend someone because they have the *right* to say it. 

I don't care if people use the word ""retarded"" to describe something stupid when talking to their mates. However I would be pissed off if someone kept using it infront of someone who has down's syndrome. 


But this is in general terms, as I said, I was mainly joking about your original comment. It might not have sounded jokey but I have a pretty dry sense of humour, so obviously a lot of jokes I make are presented as serious. 

Don't get me wrong, the people who blindly support political correctnes are just as bad as those who blindly oppose it. The sensible, adult thing to do seems to be to show some compasion and tact when dealing with people.

With the brainstorm example I think people should be able to use the word. It should even be fine in schools. However if you know an individual finds that term extremly upsetting then why use it infront of them? Sure maybe you have the right to, but that doesn't mean you should exercise that right. If you say it, knowing it will upset someone, just because you think you hsould be allowed to then you are a twat. Especially as there are other ways to say the same thing. so it would be needlessly upsetting someone. And this is a political corectness issue but is obviously a **massively** different view to those who support blanket bans, etc. 

Anyway didn't the whole brainstorm thing turn out to be a small minority of people with epilepsy, etc being vocal? And that most of the community they claimed to be speaking for had no problem with it? Might be remebering wrong though. 

Another reason it is not a black and white issue is that we (I assume) all agree that everyone is entiteld to be ""equal before the law and are entitled to equal protection of the law"" and that ""all are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination"" and perhaps slightly more controversially that trying to oppose this is a form of discrimination itself. So, for example, we might say that people aren't allowed to call people ""niggers"" or ""retards"", well why is that any differnt to something seemingly silly like ""brainstorm""? Obviously from our perspective we can talk about the historical connotations of the word, the way the word is being used, etc. But surely human rights are there to protect individuals rights no matter what. So if someone feels like they are being discriminated and upset then why shouldn't they protected the same way as someone being called ""nigger""? I'm playing devil's advocate on this point, because I don't actually agree with it, but I can appreciate how it is very complicated legally to decide what is and isn't ""ok"" behaviour. Where do a person's individuals rights stop and where do the next person's begin? 

Anyway I banged on for much too long. Just thinking out loud really. 

tl;dr you should be allowed to say, for example, retard as much as you want but just because you can say it, it doesn't mean you wouldn't be a twat for saying it in certain contexts.

Holtby has play well also.  I think he will thrive in the new pressing system that Poch has introduced.  Pressing from the front, doing quick neat touches and the freedom to rotate between the creative front 3.  I think this might be Holtby's season to shine.

Honourable mentions for Lamela who has worked really, really hard to get back to fitness and show what he can do.  You can tell every time he is playing he's giving it all.  Fair play.  Also Soldado has show glimpses of what he can do.  His neat passes and fantastic vision to set up goals.  He is a lot more vocal as well.  Kind of like captaining the front.  I don't think he will score goals after goals this season because I don't think Spurs are playing for him to do that.  The goals will come from a collection of the forward 3 midfielders... whoever Poch decides they will be.

Wetherspoons are fine, as /u/BlackJackKetchum noted, if you bring your own entertainment.

The food is decent, and pretty cheap. They normally have a decent selection of beers, so that's a good thing they have going on.

Plus I'm sure they didn't blink enough. Anyway. The yoga thing looks quite good.

Then I went to the pub. Little bit late, got there at about 4.10, soaked from a quick rain shower. Couldn't see her in there so I ordered my coke (driving later) and chatted to some friends. Then I went out the back to the smoking shelter just to see if anyone was cowering in there trying not to drown and there she was. We chatted away merrily, and then she went to get a drink. Her card was declined though so I offered to pay. I asked the barman how much, he said ""About tree fiddy"" and then I realised that she was drinking Fosters and I made my excuses and left.

Nah actually it's true up until the smoking shelter bit. I went out there and there was no-one about, so I chatted to some friends a bit more.

The best rock/metal nightclub in the south of the UK shut its doors in 2000 I think. It was based on the seafront in what is now Charles St &amp; Envy. Student nights on Wednesday were a laugh and Friday nights were just heaving with great people and excellent music. I celebrated my 21st in 1991 there and I think I started going there when I was about sixteen (yes I know) and carried on going almost every week right up until it shut.

A sad day for Brighton and for the rock/metal/industrial music scene in the town.

Whilst the Caroline of Brunswick is a good rock/metal pub, it's not a rock/metal nightclub.

The Years was hands down the best nightclub I ever went to being that I knew the people that ran it, lived with one of the DJs and scored from one of the bouncers. Friendly place, no violence, never any trouble and just a great place if you loved Rock/metal/industrial music

true,blue_strat,null,null,"If this is just a part-time job for college, great. If this is for paying rent and living off, here's some advice:

""Customer service"", ""contact centre"", and ""inbound/outbound sales"" are call centres. If you really have to go for something like that, go for inbound (product support, upselling, etc.), not outbound (cold calling for sales/donations). In either case they're generally not great places to work: pressure from supervisors, neon/plastic environments, constant noise, etc.

Sales is a word to avoid, especially when you're so young, since there are a million small companies out there that will wring a few sales out of you then *expect* you to quit within a week. The first red flag in a description is that however many words they use, you cannot tell what they're selling. But you may still find it appealing, so you'll apply. The second red flag will be a same-day e-mail or phone call asking for an interview.

If you go to it, there will be youngish managers who will ""test"" you with a basic bullshit psychology test which anyone could pass with flying colours, then fire you up into giving an emotional pledge to join their crusade. Unless you suddenly rage and punch someone in the mouth, you'll be hired. When you come in on Monday you'll find a cool, fun office with bean bags, a Radio 1 playlist going, and a huge buzz. Then you'll go knocking on the doors of the poorest areas in your city trying to get someone to sign up to whatever you're selling. Whatever they promise, you may not get paid, and if you do, half will be taken by the managers.

Unless it's a good car dealership (still not great) or something, avoid sales listings like the plague.

Now, retail. It can be good. You can have a good team, meet loads of customers, and work on your social skills. The pay could be alright and you might even get decent hours. However, you might also (especially at big chains) find a distrustful management, archaic and faulty payroll system, and the constant stress of arranging hours each week. Almost no one gives full-time roles to the bottom rung these days unless they're drivers/warehouse, and the overtime necessary to make up 20 or 40 hours a week can become suddenly scarce.

The important thing is to keep your wits about you. Make sure you know what you're getting into before you start, keep track of the hours you work and how much you should be paid, don't get into personal dramas with anyone, and decide on a long-term plan. Loads of people get bottom-rung jobs when they leave school and end up staying for years because change is scary - make sure you keep your passion or career goals in mind and work towards getting a job in that direction.",0,1407001334,null,0,false,0,cjf08wp,t3_2cf0tz,t1_cjf08wp,t3_2cf0tz,null,1435033734,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,valaranin,lfcflame,,"&gt;Buy-out clauses are prevalent in Spain and are somewhat different to a release clause. They are a mandatory element of most Spanish contracts and are usually set at a very high figure which is not necessarily the true market value of the player. The player has to literally ‘buy out’ his contract at the stipulated amount, though in practice, it is the purchasing club who pays the amount via the player. This can be a complicated process because of the practical tax logistics of a purchasing club transferring the ‘buy-out’ fee to the player who will in turn buy out his contract.  We saw this with Manchester United’s reported failed bid with Anders Herrera and Javi Martinez’s successful transfer to Bayern Munich.

true,kierdoyle,null,null,"Having some degree of tactical variability is a good thing, but stability is also beneficial. Last season (as well as post-Ancelotti), we had very little options tactically. We could sit a deep 4-2-3-1 and be very compact, hard to break down, but 4-2-3-1 has its short comings going forward. Against the Stokes, the Norwiches, the West Hams and Crystal Palaces, we don't need 2 out and out holding midfield players. Our other option was a more outgoing 4-3-3, with our wide players having substantially less defensive responsibility.

City are so good because they can play with 2 up top, or they can play 4-2-3-1 and defend if they have to. They don't play the same system week in and week out. 

At the very least, having a 4-4-2 (3 at the back isn't plausible with the squad we have, better suited to grafty wingers who just run and cross, not playmaking dribbling wingers that we have) whether it be a Liverpool-esque diamond (sorry but it was successful against shit teams last year) or a flat 4, having something else in our back pocket isn't a bad idea. Especially when we're playing against a 10-0-0 at Upton Park.

I would like to see us ditch mikel and buy schniderlin to replace him, who is homegrown and a very good player, and would put us at 16.

Option B:

 Buy a homegrown forward. Since we filled up our foreign slots already this would be a much similar option. However, the only decent homegrown striker available I can think of is jay Rodriguez, who is nowhere near the quality of bony, remy, and benteke.

Feruz needs to keep playing at youth level, and maybe go on loan to Spain or Vitesse or somewhere. He's tiny and the English leagues might be a bit too physical for him to start with. 

First choice new player for me would be Jay Rodriguez. Different option to Costa &amp; Drogba, quick, a good finisher, and can also play on the wings if needed. Also, he is homegrown. (I see this transfer unlikely.)

Other than this, I can't think of another homegrown player that would suit us. Maybe someone will emerge in the championship and we could get them in January, but I also find this unlikely.

We were looking this year early spring, hoping to get 2/3 bed house as I have to young kids now and we want some stability.

We were also considering Help To Buy. We were going to these new developments and it was just like as described in this radio 4 gig, a feeding frenzy. Cars pouring in and out with other young families all clutching a brochure and circling around the show home, and looking at each other with 'do you think we can afford it' look. 

At first it looks really promising. You can get a 250k (then, more like 300k now) 3 bed house in what looks like a new estate. You then get to the sales office and found out whats happening. The show home that you looked at won't be built for another six months. They won't know what the price will be, but you will have to pay then whatever is the going rate. You also cannot secure a place then. You need to go onto a waiting list, often 30-40 deep. So the house is not built, and your in queue to get a chance at it, and you don't know how much it will be for.

In the end, myself and my wife realized we were getting caught up in the frenzy. We just looked at each other and said ""This is insane""

Now we are back to saving and won't be considering it again, until this time next year. By then it will either be more higher in price, or it will have crashed.

One thing for sure is. they cannot continue to go and up, and at the moment they are (in most areas) hugely over inflated. This is not just for the first time buyers as well, those already in ownership are finding it tough to move up the ladder.

But what can you say? They will just find an article writing on a study performed by some so called economic investment specialists (with no clue how funded the report), saying that property will continue to go up until 2020.

BR's campaign is about building for the future, if we got a decent run in the CL and won a domestic cup, I would take 4th right now and every day. It's about wanting to build a squad that will dominate Europe and the world and it doesn't happen over night, CL football is what attracts the young talents to come and play for us, saying I want to win the league is obvious and I wouldn't be *just* as happy if we won the league as I would be if we finished 4th, I'd be over the moon, but with the competition we face in teams competing for top 4 right now, and United are genuine contenders, we only have as good a chance as any in the best 5 teams to finish outside the top 4, so 4th would be a positive outcome for this year.

The main difference between United finishing 7th to when we finished outside the top 4, is that when we did it, we lost Alonso, Torres went out of form, Reina was never the same for us again, Gerrard played deeper, and was no longer as effective in the final third. Many things happened to us and a series of poor signings/managers terms, things mounted up and we were forced to re-build, whereas United still have the ingredients and have a good manager now. They are contending for the title this year whatever you think, and that makes 5 of us, so finishing 4th would CERTAINLY be a good season for us. Obviously I want them to finish outside the top 4, I want them to finish inside the bottom 3, but that just isn't reality, so I wouldn't necessarily *take* 4th, but I'd certainly be satisfied with 4th come the end of this season.

The whole things comes across as Courtois and Schwarzer are our two keepers, as of now Cech is staying but that's only as of now.

if you've been to the opera recently, you'll be aware of surtitles,which are displays for the words that are being sung. they are prohibitively expensive to hire and no schools or amateur groups do this for musicals and plays, although it seems to me quite cheap and easy to put together. 

my idea is to help schools to comply with equalities legislation in providing access to parents who are deaf or from another country who don't speak english as well as their children. there is a smaller market in wales, scotland and ireland for english surtitles in welsh and gaelic areas.

the idea is to make a number of these devices and hire them out, with or without a local agent to operate them, for performances. 

the school or theatre group supplies a script to us and we provide software loaded with the script. the operator follows the performance, changing the words on the display as it goes along. 

i have the programming done in prototype and would like to build the electronics, do some hardware prototypes, and see if we can market it on a trial basis. if it works, think about making a little business out of it. 

my design consists of a 1.5 metre long board with 3000+ LEDs in a grid configuration chained with shift registers; the custom software turns the script's characters into binary stream, which an arduino uses to pass instructions to the registers.

is this something that would interest you? experience with programming the arduino is an advantage. my partner could come on board either for a fee for R+D and then for each unit or as a business partner if willing to get involved in the business day-to-day.",0,1407007582,null,0,false,0,cjf2vgb,t3_2cfjwi,t1_cjf2vgb,t1_cjf2ubf,null,1435035032,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

This is your anxiety/stress speaking IMHO. You can't cope with the idea of going back there. We don't know exactly why - clearly you might ordinarily be an anxious person and so this type of job isn't for you, or it might be the tense relationship between yourself and the boss, or it might be the anxiety associated with getting things wrong and maybe harming other people. You really shouldn't resign* unless a doctor tells you to resign - that way you'll be in a stronger position to claim Jobseekers or maybe Employment and Support Allowance. 

You shouldn't be in poverty if you don't go into work, providing you play by the rules, because you should receive some form of sick pay or income support. The CAB will be able to steer you through the system. 

Just resolve to get some professional help from ACAS and/or the CAB on Monday. And try to forget about this dilemma until then, save for notifying work that you won't be in tomorrow. If you don't notify then there's a chance you'll be fired, which could make things especially difficult down at the Jobcentre or whenever in the future you are obliged to explain the reason for the end of your current job.

&gt;

&gt;Therefore, its known narrative elements are not a part of the *Doctor Who* universe. It may have been the basis for a similar story in another medium, however — and __that__ story may indeed be a part of the DWU.

&gt;___The Final Game___ was an unproduced serial intended to end Season 11. It would have revealed that the Doctor and the Master were actually brothers or the latter Time Lord was the former Time Lord's darker personality. This story originally ends with the Master's Roger Delgado incarnation sacrificing himself, then the Third Doctor regenerates. But the serial was never produced due to Delgado's sudden death. Instead TV: *Planet of the Spiders* replaced this story, and Delgado's character was shelved until TV: *The Deadly Assassin*, which recast the Master as Peter Pratt, in a decayed state.

Indeed (or any online job site) isn't about quality, it's about numbers and hoping your users are qualified enough and have a decent cv uploaded that it will at least result in an interview, there is a lot of software out there that can pattern match cvs against vacancies for targeted jobs by email etc but they don't prevent anyone from applying.

If you want quality you find an industry specific site (and still expect to get flooded with shite) or you pay for screening by hiring a recruitment agency.

true,34Mbit,eng-Bristol,Bristol,"An urban village is a region within a larger urban area, a neighbourhood, that provides for most of what a family unit would need within walking distance; just like a village. Your GP surgeries, schools, shops, homes, churches (tip my fedora), offices, government facilities all within a short walk. As it's within an urban setting the density of most homes would be mid-rises/maisonettes, although there would still be a considerable number of lower density terraced properties.

'Human scale' is a term used to describe the nature of places that are pleasantly within the physical scale of a human being. Long stretches of featureless 'Big Box' developments are avoided, and developments where units frequently change are encouraged. For example, it's the difference between [this](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?ll=51.536906,-2.550475&amp;spn=0.001471,0.004474&amp;t=h&amp;z=18&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=51.536905,-2.551496&amp;panoid=wQJCxj0dAnZXJsmNQaf8pQ&amp;cbp=12,129.05,,0,2.52) and [this](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=amsterdam&amp;ll=52.379516,4.894173&amp;spn=0.005724,0.017896&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=sb&amp;hnear=Amsterdam,+Government+of+Amsterdam,+North+Holland,+The+Netherlands&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=52.379523,4.88995&amp;panoid=XYTLijZeSROki2rQKdatbQ&amp;cbp=12,134.69,,0,-1). It's a balancing act between buildings getting taller but then shadowing the public space below it, and the space between buildings getting wider and creating an almost hostile environment.

Structuring traffic planning priorities in that order is a consequence of a few things. Firstly, those are the cheapest modes of transport when daily movements are on the scale of New Urbanist developments (i.e. &lt;~30 minute walk or bicycle trip). Secondly they have a positive feedback effect on the overall health of the public. Thirdly, free parking for private automobiles is a tragic waste of urban land, which has the negative effect of warping the scale between buildings. Fourthly, those modes of transport can scale up almost geometrically, whereas the inverse is true for private automobile travel.

Really, it's basically reversing what happened between 1945 and 2000 or-so.

 [**Standard deviation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard%20deviation): [](#sfw)

&gt;

&gt;In [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics) and [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory), the __standard deviation__ (__SD__) (represented by the Greek letter sigma, __[σ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma)__) measures the amount of variation or [dispersion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_dispersion) from the average.  A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be very close to the [mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean) (also called expected value); a high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a large range of values.

&gt;The standard deviation of a [random variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable), [statistical population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_population), data set, or [probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution) is the [square root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root) of its [variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance). It is [algebraically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra) simpler though in practice less [robust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_statistics) than the [average absolute deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_absolute_deviation).   A useful property of the standard deviation is that, unlike the variance, it is expressed in the same units as the data. Note, however, that for measurements with [percentage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage) as the unit, the standard deviation will have [percentage points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point) as the unit.

&gt;In addition to expressing the variability of a population, the standard deviation is commonly used to measure confidence in statistical conclusions. For example, the [margin of error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_of_error) in [polling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll) data is determined by calculating the expected standard deviation in the results if the same poll were to be conducted multiple times. The reported margin of error is typically about twice the standard deviation—the half-width of a 95 percent [confidence interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval). In science, researchers commonly report the standard deviation of experimental data, and only effects that fall much farther than two standard deviations away from what would have been expected are considered [statistically significant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistically_significant)—normal random error or variation in the measurements is in this way distinguished from causal variation. The standard deviation is also important in finance, where the standard deviation on the [rate of return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_return) on an investment is a measure of the [volatility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance\)) of the investment.

For every job you apply for you want to be spending at least an hour re-tooling your CV. Cover letter really just needs to be a few lines, but your CV **must** be tailored to every job. If they have any specific requirements then put those *front and centre*, even in their own separate section. Don't bother if you don't meet their criteria. People assessing the applications will have a checklist and if you don't meet it they won't consider you. Putting all the things on their checklist right up front will make their lives *far* easier  and put you in a stronger position.

Job that requires 3 A-levels grades A*-C, relevant work experience and a forklift truck license? You should have that shit on the top third of the first page, beneath your vital info. Seriously! I can't stress this enough.

We get all sorts where I work and people just don't bother reading the job specifications, or doing their research. We've had people on phone interviews who don't know anything about the job, people who can hardly speak English for a customer-facing role. We even had people submit CVs for a job which required very specific legal knowledge about Spanish regulations, as well as both Spanish and English skills, from people who didn't meet any of those criteria.

if you are curious about the extra strength one just order the smaller version of it I think it's 30ml for about £6.
