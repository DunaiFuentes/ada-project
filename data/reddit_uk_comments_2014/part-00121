 He is more superior to Lallana statistically, has great vision, great set piece taker and I am so sure that he would fit perfectly in Premier League... He would also not be overpriced since he is not English. You realize how Lallana's price has been probably inflated by including him in POTY competition?

 Rakitic is relatively lot more worth, but he wouldn't probably cost a lot more than Lallana... I mean, if we can get Rakitic for the same price as Lallana, there is simply no sense on why someone would be more keen to bring Lallana. If Lallana could cost us about 10-12 million less, then we could take a move for Lallana.

true,[deleted],null,null,"There are a few anomalies in the way this was run. I suspect (though cannot be arsed to work out and prove) from a purely statistical perspective, namely the amount of people that responded was extremely high and the number of those respondents that attended matches or were season ticket holders - that could be explained by the far reach of the marketing of the survey which was pretty good (I learned a couple of decent blogs I hadn't seen before) and the fact the people close to the club cared enough to vote - or people lied about how many games they went to because of personal status issues/over claim (these are normally filtered out of professional surveys but here they can be, I think, safely ignored). Also I believe through Survey Monkey they did ban multiple attempts from the same IP (yes, you could vote on multiple PCs or phones though)  take a straw poll after 1k votes and compared to the final amount which apparently didn't change much and is a reliable indicator that there isn't a surge of double voters. 

Finally there isn't a huge motivator for the YES or NO camp to want to distort the vote either way - yes people care but it's not like there's immediate personal gain if they coerce 100 people into voting with them or they cheat the system in some way. I would suggest people care enough to vote but probably not enough to cheat. Unless their name name is a certain Mr. S. Allardyce.

In conclusion (and as someone who works with a shit load of surveys though I am not a statistician) I'd say that for the amount of effort and money (low) combined with the speed of turnaround and simplicity (high) this isn't a bad effort at all and should be taken pretty much at face value. 

Please see the comments regarding the authenticity of the survey at the bottom of this post https://www.westhamtillidie.com/posts/2014/04/28/poll-result-77-of-west-ham-fans-say-sam-allardyce-should-go",0,1398747922,null,0,false,0,ch4tnp8,t3_246c38,t1_ch4tnp8,t1_ch48i8u,null,1433569090,1,false,Hammers,t5_2sco3,1

First rate reporting as they stand outside the school in which a teacher was stabbed yesterday and died. Does this need to be headline news ? Sure, it's a tragic event, but does it require reporters to go the length and breadth of Great Britain to disturb people's peace in a time of mourning ? I'll leave you to decide that. Should students be screened for weapons is the discussion ? Text in, and have your view splurged across the screen.

EDIT: Tornado's in the US again, and Max Clifford has been a naughty,naughty boy, and  one of his victims has gone on TV, but remains anonymous. We see her from behind, and it looks like Susanna Reid is talking into a mirror. Looks like ITV has requested Susanna to keep her cleavage tucked away. That's not going to increase views, ITV ! Get your priorities in order, give the nation what it wants !

EDIT: Unrest in Donetsk again, so what's the logical solution ? Let's send reporters to risk their lives !!!

EDIT: Doctor goes on TV to talk about the bane of the Daily Mail, the c-word. No, no cunt, cancer. The doctor is called Hilary Jones, and is a man ! I bet he got the shit kicked him out of him at school.

EDIT: Robbie Williams is having another baby !!!! YAY, LET'S GET EXCITED, yeah, no I'm ok. I can't work out if the Hollywood reporter is sat in front of a green screen, or he is actually sat in front of the Hollywood sign.

EDIT: Now they're talking about career advice. FUCK ME, this should be good. Ha, no actual advice was given, just reading out people texts saying that they were told as a child that the job they wanted was unlikely, and now they have those dream jobs. You go, girl, don't let the man put you down. Weather's on, surprisingly the weather presenter isn't pregnant, say it's going to be a wet and cloudy one today, so you know today it's going to be a scorcher. Going on a tea break, don't want to be reporting anymore on the stabbing in Leeds, the family don't need the news to be debated on early morning TV, but they do have a snazzy metal detector that makes a cute noise when it bleeps.

EDIT: Interviewing a nineteen year old with incurable bowel cancer that has raised £3 million, with the help of celebrities such as Jack Whitehall and Russell 'Rusty Rockets' Brand.

EDIT: Calendar reports that Yorkshire is one of the fattest counties in the UK, woo ! Uncomfortable delay between transition of Calendar and G.M.B . Got my tea, (Tetley, if you're interested. Milk and two sugars.) Arsenal won 3-0 last night against Chateau Nouveau, and Champions League qualification is looking more likely for the Gunners, and reports that Chelsea are ready to bid over £70 million for Luis Suarez. News about cycling, but no one cares about cycling.

EDIT: Andi Peters is in Saffron Waldon, which sounds like a delightful place to live, but it looks like a shithole. The coffin-dodgers have come out in full force to ambush Andi for the money prize. One of them said if they won, they'd won, they'd spend it on their grandkids. That's boring and therefore wrong, they should spend it on cocaine and go out on a high. Next on is a girl who has lost all her memories and can't store information in her brain. Ben Shepard is really insensitive and asks her what she remembers on the day she lost the ability to sore memories. OBVIOUSLY FUCKING NOTHING, BEN, READ THE SHEET YOU WERE GIVEN BEFOREHAND !

EDIT: Going to be news on Prince George later, I wonder what *crazy adventures* he's been up to ? Zac Efron is on later as well and we find out what it's like to be his neighbour !! Can't believe I've got another hour and half of this cack, I mean, amazing TV.

EDIT: The title sequence froze, which was amusing. Richard Arnold is talking about his interview with the Zaccers, I've always thought Richard Arnold looks like badger that's had his face flattened. He also has an annoying private-school accent that makes you want to punch him. Zac Efron is soo dreamy (swoons). Film he's promoting looks shit, wouldn't waste your money on it. Transistion back to Calendar news, nothing's changed in Yorkshire since she was last on our screens, which pretty much sums up Yorkshire.

EDIT: Prince William and Princess Katherine celebrate their third anniversary, which also falls on the birthday of Adolf Hitler. That doesn't really help the conspiracy theories with Diana, does it ? IT WAS THE NAZI'S ALL ALONG !! Calm down, Jim, and take your meds.

EDIT: Not a lot is happening now, just recycling the stories they told earlier. They've teased us with going back to Saffron Waldon after the adverts, I can't wait !! Apparently, the teacher who died yesterday was at the school for forty years, you have to feel sorry for her, forty years in Yorkshire, *the horror* !!

EDIT: We're back in Saffron Waldon, with a roar of cheers from the coffin dodgers. Wendy and her son have won the mystery prize, whatever could it be ? And what was it ? AN ITV GOODIE BAG WITH AN ITV BRANDED UMBELLA ? YAY, THAT'S SO MUCH BETTER THAN £1000 !! Patrick Kielty is on later, can't wait.

EDIT: Kevin Phillips is retiring from football and Susanna reveals she supports Crystal Palace. Well, I guess she had to have some flaws. Footballers take [photos of bananas](http://imgur.com/a/lneTJ) to stop racism, and Roberto Carlos takes one with the most rancid banana I've ever seen.

EDIT: Non-news on the Royals, and the presenters discussing their third year anniversary. I'm glad Richard Arnold isn't there telling of his, I bet his cum face is the stuff of nightmares. Gok Wan is doing adverts for Activia, *of course* he is.

EDIT: Reporting that Robbie Williams is having a baby again. Does anyone really care ? I've never understood the whole idolisation of celebrities, seems rather bizzare that people care that much about people they have never met, and possibly never will. Robbie's first kid is called Theodora. THEODORA ? If I ever have kids, they're going to have normal names like James or Sarah, not something that will get them no end of abuse at school.

EDIT: 8.06, and flights are suspended at East Midlands after a problem with a plane.

EDIT: 8.18, and only ten minutes till I can escape this hell. Sorry Lorraine fans, but there's no way I'm keeping ITV on, no matter how entertaining it was yesterday. Patrick Kielty's on after the break, to talk about Soccer Aid

EDIT:Back in Saffron Waldon, and Curly won £200, but it's raining now in Saffron Waldon. Bet he wish he'd won that shitty umbrella.

EDIT: The Kielster is talking about Soccer Aid, and has crap banter with Ben Shepard. They keep cutting to Ben tackling Zinedine Zidane in past games. That's probably the proudest he'll ever be in his life, because his TV presence is a detrimental to the UK. And at 8.28 we bid goodbye to Susanna and co. for another day.

I had no prior work experience at all and got into the first one I interviewed for at a really great place, so it does carry some weight on your CV. 

I'm actually from Coventry as well, another of your choices. It's certainly a lower ranked uni, the 2nd one in the city as Warwick is much higher, and I don't know much about it really, but if you've got an offer from Birmingham I'd recommend going for that one over it. Obviously I'm biased when I say I like Cov as a place just because it's home, but Birmingham is a much bigger city with much, much more variety in shopping and nights out etc. Not that I ever varied where I went out to at all, Snobs every time!

true,PlayingForTheShirt,,Bangor,"Ah, Belfast during an event. Let me give you an idea of what NI can do during an event. You see this may come as good news or bad news to you and your dear wife but Northern Ireland is, in all honesty, a collective of event junkies. 

This of course has it's good an it's bad elements. It means that when the Northern Ireland football team became good the event junkies arrived in their thousands after years of (now priced out) fans sat through the dirge of years gone past...winless, goalless and 1-0 down to Canada. 

We also see the young liberal minded individual who can have his or hers bad qualities on the event junkie front. Attending festivals in the horrid 'mainland' like 'Glasto' and 'V' and other such things us Ulsterfolk don't understand. Calling event locations such as 'Mandella' and 'The Limelight' uncool and such other horrible things. 

Then you have the event junkies who just love a good event. We love it over here. Especially if yer one of those foreign types who have the funny accent. You probably haven't been here before, we'll take the piss outta you, but it'll be done over a pint. Those Italians are coming and we're goin to show them a party.

Belfast will turn into somewhat of a drinking party around the bars and pubs in the city. People will be in high spirits and you'll probably hear a lot of terrible singing of songs you never thought could possibly still be popular in any Western country. You'll be offered drinks by groups of strange men dawning smart-casual 80s football regalia, suspiciously fake designer sun glasses and that '5 years in Her Majesties pleasure' look to his cheek and jaw bones. Fear not, for these are truly timid creatures...just keep an eye on yer wife for her sake. 

It'll be busy, don't doubt it, but Belfast is shite when it's dead so make the most of it. Hit up the bar areas if you don't mind queuing and get a pre-swally if you don't want to queue as much. You'll find some great characters and have a good laugh. We're the most welcoming bunch of arseholes you ever did meet.

Put Lallana in our side and his goals and assists go up.

I was behind Micky last summer. I was behind Costa. But when everyone lost their shit over Willian it was the final fucking straw. The guy is talented, but he, as EvenArrantzier correctly noted, offers very little end product. And that's been the case his whole career. The guy can dribble and not much else. I said all last summer I'd rather let Raheem and Ibe fight it out than throw money at the wind with Willian. And that was when I was just guessing we'd finish 5th like everyone else. We're in first place after 36 matches with Raheem.

They literally let packs of roving bigots run wild through the Short Strand, as well as other parts of the city and country. I saw them, it was pretty intimidating and I imagine anyone who lives on the Short Strand felt even worse. 

The thugs ran free while the police gave a green light to violence and threatening behaviour, in favour of prosecuting after the fact. Which is all fine and well until you remember that large numbers of people (not just those in the Short strand) were affected and intimidated by the violence and threatening behaviour, and this could (and should) have been avoided. 

I understand why the PSNI took the approach that they did, as the idiots rioting allowed themselves to be filmed - and a number of them faced subsequent charges, but at the same time I and a lot of other people think they got off far too easily. I can't imagine you or I could expect such special treatment if we engaged in similiar behaviour. Compare the police presence and reaction of the flag protests to the G8 protests, which weren't nearly as aggressive or violent, but were locked down days in advance. There's a double standard, a double standard brought about by the PSNI not wanting to inflame a population of recreational rioters who made it clear they would destroy not just the economy, but potentially people's lives, if they weren't allowed to run around chanting and throwing bottles at whoever got in their way.

Hmm, I'm not sure in this case. When I took out my mortgage, I was told the value would be considered to be the lower of the survey valuation and the sale price. However, this is quite different as it's very much like giving a gift.

Regarding tax, there's this:

http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/sdlt/calculate/transfer-ownership.htm

&gt; Property given as a gift

&gt;If the property is received as a gift there's no SDLT to pay, so long as there's no outstanding mortgage on it. But if the person who receives the gift takes over some or all of an existing mortgage, then SDLT may be payable if the value of the mortgage is over the SDLT threshold.


If the ""value of the mortgage"" means the remaining amount, then you'll pay stamp duty on the £200k.

&gt; how can I go about getting a mortgage for this?

true,ProtoKun7,smith,Smith,"&gt;1)What exactly happened to the Doctor after Martha came back from around the world when, ""The Master"" took over. The Doctor was a shriveled up old man looking thing and then everybody on the planet was saying his name or better yet, saying, ""Doctor"" and he got his form back. How exactly did that happen? He then got these weird powers where he could float and stop, ""The Master"" from his evil plan. Can somebody please explain that. 

He used all the mental energy harnessed by the Archangel satellite network. It's...more of a stretch.

&gt;
2) Another one about, ""The Master"" was what were those weird powers he had when he came back. He was able to shoot energy out of his hands but his body was breaking down too and he was able to super leap like the first Superman could. Can the Doctor do that? Why didn't he just regenerate if his body was breaking down? 

The resurrection process at the prison was sabotaged, so he wasn't brought back properly and was burning life force at an alarming rate.

&gt;
3) This is more of a writing question. After David Tennant left, did the writers change or something because it seems like he was going around saying goodbye to all his friends. I mean he can still go and see Jack, Martha, Mickey and even Donna's parents, hell Sarah too! Were they trying to change it up or something so they're gone for good now? It confuses me. 

Yeah, RTD left as head writer, replaced by Steven Moffat, and other production crew changed as well.

&gt;
4)After he loses Rory and Amy, he stops helping people which I get but then we get a look at the Tardis again and its completely different! Where the hell did that change come from? When it went from Eccleston to Tennant it didn't change at all. It was destroyed when Smiths Doctor came around but it only changed a bit. It basically looked the same without those oddly shaped pillars is all and more glass. But after Rory and Amy are lost, it looks more metal and computerized.

I've not really looked beyond this though. Other schemes where people have to do unpaid work have covered ""reasonable travel expenses"" (like MWA: http://www.money.co.uk/article/1009976-help-to-work-scheme-2-minute-guide.htm which also has to cover things like childcare)

That money article also says that going in every day isn't the only option, it's

1. Go in every day
2. Do some volunteering like gardening or cooking meals for the elderly
3. Do training

It's not too different from other schemes like MWA. The biggest change it seems is that there's no limit to how long it can go on for.

As usual, lots of it sound fairly reasonable (if you've been out of work for 3 years and *can* work, then you'll essentially be paid some small sum to do something in the community or do some more training). If everything went right, you'd only be coming in every day if you

* Can work
* Can't find work in 3 years of searching

There is definitely a marked difference between how people wear makeup in England (or at least the parts I'm in on a regular basis: Liverpool (and areas around it), Manchester, London, and the places in between) and how they do it in North America (I will note that there are still some regional differences in NA due to size, but I'm just trying to make a more general point here). 

You guys are right on the heavy foundation thing/tanning, as that's a trend that seems to have not picked up in Canada or the US. Foundation tends to be lighter, if not non-existent. Also - and this is especially true for the North - there is a heavy emphasis on EYEBROWS EYEBROWS EYEBROWS that I had never seen until I moved here. Hell, sometimes I just go eyebrow watching in Liverpool and try to figure out if that's her natural hair colour, or if her hair is her natural colour, or (most common) I have no idea what her natural hair colour is. I recommend this on days when you're super bored.

Overall, makeup here is much more dramatic and much heavier. I find the Canadian trends tend to stick to a much more natural look, with the biggest focuses being eyes (eyeliner is always something I can expect most people to be wearing). I tend to feel like some sort of weird interloper in Liverpool especially since I probably look like a total slob while everyone else looks like they're about 10 minutes away from hitting up a hot party (minus the curlers.

You can't really have a significant percentage of the population brazenly ignoring a major part of the law everyday and still expect them to have faith that it's a system working for them.

The upshot is that while things like legalising weed might not be the most fundamentally pressing issues they are major issues of our cultural life in which the law has become utterly disconnected from reality. More than that what should be a easy win all around isn't and it's becoming a major and frustrating sticking point between an large group that already feels deeply disenfranchised and the people in power.

She loves Liverpool, she loves the city, she loves the camaraderie with the other players’ wives. So she’s a real pillar in his life.
“Luis travelled across the world to find her again. It’s an incredible story. She left Uruguay and went to Barcelona with her parents. He wanted to move to Europe so he would have the chance to meet up with her again. When he went to Holland – it’s a beautiful story – he was only 17 and had gone to Groningen, he asked the coach for a few days off.

Their is a reason that Barcelona could play like that and that's because they had alves.

naughton should be gone, because he's not good enough for what we aspire to be. rose should be gone, because he's not going to want to be a back up, and that's only about as good as he can be. chiriches should not be kept because he's underdeveloped or raw, or whatever, his season has been borderline pathetic, because he's not good enough. obviously i think we should keep vertonghen. we should keep dawson too, because i think we should try to get absolutely everything out of him, and he's not too old/bad to be part of a squad of 4 center-backs. Kaboul's interesting. I'm kind of indifferent towards him. if he IS contracted until mid 2015, then we should keep him on for next season. fryers should be kept, not let go on loan, because he provides back up for whichever new left full back we go after, and because he can play cb when our squad of four all get fucked by the medical team.


as for mids, i think we should hope paulinho has a blinding world cup so that we can get rid of him for north of 13m, and buy a premier league ready replacement. also sig or chadli have to make way for us to buy a severe upgrade at left wing.

I've seen similar questions and it's usually pretty obvious why the person is in trouble. I don't see that in your words.

People do have prejudices (even if they don't admit to them). Prejudices aren't necessarily bad and evil, it can just mean pre-judgement and assumption. e.g. I must not talk to a female stranger who is wearing a full veil.

Not everyone feels comfortable being around someone who is dressed so differently, or in a way which projects a differently ideology. A turban is a fairly bold statement, you can't not notice it.

I honestly think the turban might be the last barrier. I think it might be possible that people don't get closer because the turban says to them that there's a side of you which is foreign to them and they don't want to go there. Or they feel that they can't go there either out of respect or they just don't want to spend the time and extra-effort doing it.

I'm non-religious and I have a few religious friends. With regards to their Christian beliefs and habits, I simply don't go there. There is no common ground for us to go there. I don't believe in Gods and miracles and prayers and they do. I don't see any point in having discussions about it because I'm not there to change their mind or to go over old ground and arguments. There will always be that barrier there as I'm not going to change my ideology in order engage in that part of their lives.

Yes, the UK negotiated an opt-out, but Salmond is not trying to hoodwink the EU into thinking he intends to join the Euro to get membership. He's making it perfectly clear that as part of the negotiation process he intends not, in the short term, to undertake the voluntary actions necessary to join.

Thus, he's clearly asking the EU membership to accept a de facto opt-out as part of Scotland's application. Making this position *no worse* than the UK's. Scotland can negotiate this in good faith, and if the other countries don't like it, they don't need to let Scotland in on those terms.

&gt; A subnational parliament has not decided to hold a referendum that it has no legal entitlement to hold? No shit!

I'm afraid I can't parse that... although if you're trying to draw a comparison with Scotland and the UK, then sure, I think it's fair comment to say that Wales is behaving as a better UK member than Scotland by not waiting to leave.

*In the course of a short conversation, I simply made the point that people were entitled to their personal preferences.  It is morally acceptable to prefer heterosexuality over homosexuality, or vice versa.  Most of us prefer one or the other.  So let’s look at the Sun’s claims:*

*“It’s OK to despise gay people”: How the Sun gets from “It’s OK to have personal preferences” to “It’s OK to despise gay people”, I’m not sure.*

*“Being gay is a mental condition”.  In about thirty seconds I was able to identify two blog posts in my extensive blog archive in which I make the point explicitly that homosexuality is not a disease.*

*“Homophobia is OK”.    As a technical linguistic point, I have questioned the use of the term “phobia” in this context, since it has a specific meaning in psychiatry which does not (it seems to me) apply in this case.

In a hypothetical situation where City beat Everton by a single goal - their goal difference will be 59 to our 50. That means we have to make up 9 to catch up (potentially more if City hammer their last two opponents). 9-3 = 6. Scoring 6 or more against this Newcastle side most certainly isn't impossible, they look like they don't care at all at the moment and in all honesty have nothing to fight for. Aston Villa and Norwich on the other hand are both fighting to stay up so will more than likely pose a much greater challenge to City than Newcastle will to us (I realise I'm being incredibly optimistic here as City are at home for both games).

Obviously it's out of our hands, but there's no reason why we can't at least TRY to score as many goals as possible over the next two games. Winning is a must, winning by large margins in both games is almost just as important.

Having said that - that might all change if Everton do do us a favour and get a draw with City. THEN it all changes and we simply need to win. I would take two boring 1-0 wins if that does happen...

true,Amonette2012,null,null,"Basically because people are more affected by subtle media influence than they realise. Most of the people joining the 'hate on UKIP' bandwagon haven't actually bothered to do the slightest bit of research, or haven't realised that the reason they're hearing so much bad press about one particular party is because the others are spending a fortune on spin doctors and taking their buddies in the media out for nice boozy lunches. So when one UKIP MP says something fucking stupid, it gets fifty times more attention than when an MP from one of the main three parties says something fucking stupid. 

Also, most people do not really bother finding out exactly why it is a bad thing that we are in Europe, or realise how much it is costing us and how much power we've already handed over to them. If you asked the average man on the street, you'd find that most of them aren't aware that VAT is an EU tax, or that the president of the EU can commit our country to spending millions on something we have no say on (for example giving tornado relief funds to a country like America, who's defence budget is something like 80 billion a year).

Thirdly, hating UKIP is popular because no one likes to be thought of as racist, and no one really wants to be the one to stand up and say 'hang on a minute - isn't this country getting just a little over populated? Are we sure we're ok with current immigration levels? Because as soon as you do someone goes 'ooo you're a RACIST!'

Unfortunately UKIP are plagued with the same problem as every other political party - i.e. many people go into politics for the wrong reasons, hold deplorable personal views and occasionally forget to filter themselves and come out with something fucking stupid. Unfortunately someone can get quite high up in any organisation before revealing themselves to be an utter cunt, and some of these cunts are attracted to UKIP because they are hoping to turn a debate about unchecked immigration into a racist debate. Just as some people join the conservative party in order to try and secure tax cuts for their cronies. 

Personally I'm voting UKIP not because I agree with all of what they say - their stance on gay marriage is not good, they tend to vote no when they should vote yes just to spite Europe and they need to do more to root out racism in their ranks, but I want out of Europe, and I also want to see that smarmy twat Cameron go pale with shock as he realises how badly he's misjudged the people. Look at the polls. Lots of people feel this way. UKIP may be a shower of bastards but in case no one else has noticed this, THEY'RE ALL A SHOWER OF BASTARDS!

Because she's the one getting pregnant, not him. 



If you went up to the roof of your house with a friend because you wanted to jump off because you thought it would be fun, and if you asked your friend to push you off, and if you then broke your leg, why should your friend be responsible for the medical costs?

Your friend is involved in you jumping off, but the responsibility is squarely yours. If you tried to take your friend to court over it, everyone would think you're a dick.

true,HotBeefTrauma,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"I used to work as a transport planner and did some time work in this about 5 years ago. At that time that benefit cost ratio for the project was acceptable but not stunning. There are a number of issues facing the project also.

* the UK is a small country than most counties in Western Europe. Look at the distance between London and Birmingham and compare it to the distances between Paris and Bordeaux or Madrid and Barcelona. Not so far is it? The benefits of HSR only really accrue over those longer distances. Having a shorter route with multiple stops diminishes the time savings and limits the business case.

* Most of our city centres are severely limited in what infrastructure could be introduced. The cost of tunnelling into London or constructing huge bridges is enormous, let alone the cost at the other stations. What was proposed was parkway stations, I.e. out of town stations that people catch a smaller train too. This again reduces the value of the project.

* There are such things as agglomeration benefits. Basically the gains that can be achieved by things being better connected. Whilst HSR would potentially create these, it would also serve to strengthen the S.E. economy at the expense of the Midlands and the north by bringing the commuter belt further northwards. Already in the UK we have a brain drain of talent to London and HSR would only exacerbate this.

But it's not a good example football-wise for these reasons:

QPR were a man down meaning more space to play in.

QPR were not as deep as chelsea, in fact for the goal Neville showed they got caught out of position. The fact that the ball over the top to dzeko was even a possibility shows there was space in behind.

QPR were nowhere near as well drilled in this type of defending. It's chelsea's big strength.

There things contribute to making it all look rather easy for man city in the clip Neville showed. Just keep calm and pass the ball and you'll score in a few passes.

I think a better example would have been our (first?) goal against cardiff. Cardiff were at full strength and well set with 9 players protecting their penalty area. It took something like 5 minutes of patient probing before henderson eventually played the killer throughball. THAT's patience, keeping your cool and contuining to play our football against a parked bus. And it shows how difficult it can be.

The next President of the Commission will be elected by the Parliament - the end result should be an executive similar in 'democratic accountability' to the UK one (but slightly better as the Parliament gets to both vote for, and fire the President and other Commissioners, in the latter case, without firing themselves first).

The Parliament regularly debates issues, amends or alters legislation and blocks Commission proposals when they don't like it - but much like our legislative process, the executive doesn't propose laws unless it thinks there is a good chance of them passing.

Berating Tesco for saying ""Same luxury. Less lorries."" is, in my opinion, ridiculous.

Fewer lorries"" might appease some crusty grammarians, but at the expense of ruining things for everyone else.

I also wouldn't be surprised if someone at Tesco made the decision to ignore that rule in favour of a more elegant slogan, and good for them I reckon.

That said, I think playing with Milner really suits his game and allows him to stretch teams with through balls in key areas - as Milner will make those runs.

Nasri won't. He'll come short, stand up the fullback, and feint as if he's going to try and beat his man, but never does, and just passes the ball sideways.

He doesn't affect games in the way he should and when he does, it's rare. He's unreliable, and in my opinion a show pony is a fair description. He can link up well in tandem with Silva, but most of our threat out of that pair comes from David, he could link up with someone like Milner and we'd have just as big a threat going forward, arguably more so dependant on the opposition, and we'll be stronger defensively.

I'm not sure you can say Nasri's best position is behind the striker, as he's rarely played there in his whole career. He spent the vast majority of his time at Arsenal out wide, likewise here. That's where he's played his best football. I see that positional argument as just another excuse for his poor performances.

With the amount of quality we have in the side he doesn't have the quality to play in the hole, he doesn't warrant a place there. So if he can't deliver in a wide position, he doesn't warrant a place in the team.

You could try making your own jerky too. Seems pretty easy if you have a good range of spices, and probably miles cheaper than £4.50 for a tiny bag

I believe I saw the same doc where I learned that she had placed it between her thighs/knees herself sitting in the car. Coffee is traditionally brought to a boil before being served, there is nothing surprising about the content being close to boiling hot, just like other hot liquid food. 

Personally I think she's more than just partly to blame herself for handling hot beverage with parts of her body unable to do fine motoric  movement.

By this logic I feel she could just as well sue the car manufacturer for not providing the car with adequate cup holders.

Again, personally, I feel common sense was the loser in this case. Just saw the trailer for hot coffee again, people feel sorry for her and turn on their judgement based on feeling sorry for her, still not being told that she held the coffee cup with her knees.

Now tattoos are forbidden in Islam...but then so is drinking, gambling, porn, and so on. The people doing it clearly don't give a damn.

There is a huge tension between the single market and the institutional powers that have been growing since the Euro disaster in order to run the currency union. HMG feels are exceding their remit into non-Euro members.

I'll let you Google the loss of soverignty yourself and the UK's concerns over the single market, but the European Banking Union is worth a look at. 

This statement from the EU itself is a high-level summary:

http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/adoption/who_can_join/index_en.htm

Note ""a euro-area candidate country must make changes to national laws and rules, notably governing its national central bank and other monetary issues, in order to make them compatible with the Treaty""

The SNP can claim to be able to fluff the final act of switching currency, but all the legal changes and handover of powers will have been made long before and they won't be telling voters about it.

Overall, I think we can sell him for decent enough money and replace him quickly and cheaply.  From within, Sandro, Holtby or Carroll would provide more energy in the deeper midfield position (hell, even Livermore could provide this, though would not be my choice), and Eriksen, Lamela, Siggy or even Kane can play the role behind the striker with no less effectiveness than what we see now in Paulinho.

true,CrashingAnalyst,eng-gloucestershire,Cheltenham,"The problem is that 'the economy' is a culmination of a lot of different factors.

Using measures such as output (growth), prices (inflation), employment and the trade deficit/surplus each gives you an indication of the economy, but no single measure tells the full story.

* output is increasing month-on-month at the minute, but we are still catching up to what our economy *can* produce
* prices have increased due to the effects of QE and low interest rates, but now because of a decline in demand (C+I+G+(X-M)) we are seeing price pressure drop (falling inflation rate, but still net inflation)
* employment is up, but at the cost of productivity down. essentially we are producing less with more people, and those people are also on lower real incomes
* trade deficit is at around £100bn a year, month-to-month it's getting smaller but we're not where we need to be

The 'BIGGER PICTURE' is that the economy is behind where it should be. We have fallen short of the strategic goals of the austerity doctrine. We're still debt-laden, and to recover we are encouraging consumer debt to prop up declines in income. Essentially the economy is being choked out at the bottom as people can't afford to spend in, in a mature economy that is almost entirely reliant on people spending. We'd expect therefore that our prices would fall (happening slowly) and our exports to increase (happening, but nowhere near fast enough) to compensate - selling our product &amp; services at cheap rates to foreign 'successful' economies basically compensates for the fact we haven't got that demand in our own system.

It goes without saying, the news only reports 'this metric got better compared to last month' as otherwise every month you would be saying 'we are tracking 40% behind target' 'we are tracking 39% behind target' 'we are tracking 38.7% behind target'.

The big question though, is simply this: 

* did we adopt the wrong policy with the austerity doctrine, 
* was it the right policy but the projections and targets were wrong, 
* or was it the right policy but circumstances beyond our control caused us to fall short.",0,1398773846,null,0,1398774271,0,ch4yxzr,t3_249k48,t1_ch4yxzr,t1_ch4xqrb,null,1433571648,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

One Christmas, he sold someone a bass, which went on to be given to the customer's son. The son was initially interested, but soon grew bored of the instrument's limited range, as is the peril with bass guitars. So, he figured he could make it into a normal guitar, just by tuning up and increasing the pitch of each string by an octave.

Next the guitar shop guy knew about this was when the father returned absolutely furious with him. Turns out, tuning a bass guitar up by an octave gives the strings enough potential energy that when they snap, they do so with enough force to lacerate your face.

No, because I value my life; I would never cycle on London Roads.

Well, I got up at 6.10am with a new alternative journey in mind; it would only take me around 1hr 5 mins. I arrived at work at 10.05am.

I don't suppose walking in the wrong direction started things off very well... FOR AN HOUR. Still, I've seen some parts of London I never want to visit again, two men on a train drinking a two litre bottle of cider and doing pull ups, and another guy with half a bottle of wine getting chased by the police onto a train (at 9.30am), so at least there was some entertainment in my morning.

The interesting aspect here is that Scotland is seeking a sterling currency zone with the rest of the UK. Putting aside talk of whether or not such a union will be realised or is infact desirable to either party (I've had that conversation too many times on Reddit  already: you can look at my comment history if you want to see my opinions on its likelihood), a sterling zone would affect the resolution of a lot of these issues, as the relevant sovereignty over fiscal policy would still be held in London. 

&gt; As a new joiner to the EU Scotland is going to have to enter (assuming they are allowed to etc etc) are the rules for new states, and that means the terms and conditions of today.

What I will say on this is that it is not clear that secession from an existing EU state necessarily means being treated as a newly joining EU state. There is no precedent. There are renowned experts with differing opinions on the matter; and there's no way to determine with any degree of certainty what the outcome will be until the decision is made (if one has to be made).

Channel 4 did a nice piece on this, summing up:

&gt; We don’t have a sensible way of resolving this war of the experts, other than to note that, since there is no precedent for a breakaway bit of an EU member state (re)applying for membership, nobody really knows for sure how this will play out.

So whether Scotland has its own currency, or is part of a sterling zone, that's pretty much as far as we can sensibly take the debate for now as there is so much uncertainty about the terms of EU membership.

I'm not really arguing whether or not adding more consequences would dissuade people from committing a crime.  I'm arguing that it's not going to be worth doing so for every kind of crime.  I would ask that we look at what effects it has on reoffending and how often that type of crime occurs before we start sentencing people for decades more than we do currently.  If we get 30-40 years down the line and we find out that there was only a 1% drop in this kind of crime after increasing the minimum length of the sentence, don't you think the money spent locking these people up for decades would have been better spent on more effective measures to lower that type of crime.  I don't claim to know how that'd be done, just that sentence length isn't the *only* part of the equation that we're able to adjust.

Yes, he walked the ball in but you make your own luck he hared up that field and put himself in the position to score. 1v1's? Our best player outside of Sterling, Suarez and Sturrdige in Henderson has fluffed nearly every one on one this season and still been pivotal to the team. 

Lallana being twice the player? I'm pointing out the huge difference in their career profile and trophy haul. Considering they're being mentioned in the same price tag it's a fair argument.

I'd suggest giving your SO address on the CV (or not giving any address at all, and if they ask, give your SO address). As long as you are contactable and able to show up on the interview, everyone should be fine.

I don't know how often you visit your SO, but I would suggest you start giving her regular visits on Fridays or staying over for Mondays and trying to get as many interviews on those days as possible.

Now, I wonder - is anything in this debate actually supported by evidence?

For argument 2, how many incidents of murder and/or assault with steel strings in prisons are reported annually?

You've got the Tory view that we should stay in for now, try to negotiate (on issues like open borders and spending), and if that negotiating doesn't go well we leave. They essentially want an EU just for trade. You've got the Labour and Lib Dem view that we stay in as in (perhaps with a little negotiation, but not as much as the Tories). That's the main 4 covered. 

Then, you have the view of parties like TUSC, who want to leave the EU as they think it represents the capitalist class too much. They want the UK to leave, then create closer links with other socialist countries both within Europe and around the world, essentially making a socialist EU, with the benefits of open borders and pooled resources, but without being a trade block.

Left Unity believe the UK should stay in the EU, but negotiate to make it more socialist. They support doing stuff like nationalising (or whatever the closest alternative is in relation to the EU) the European Central Bank, stopping the EU opposing austerity on countries, and using the EU to help out the workers. Their view is very much like that of TUSC, except Left Unity plan to do it within the EU, whereas TUSC want to set up another organisation separate to it.

Then you have a load of different views on all the little bits of what constitutes our membership on the EU. Everyone has a different view on stuff like whether we should have open borders, whether the EU should become more federal, whether the EU should have an army, loads of different stuff.

However, all we really see represented in the media is the UKIP view and the Labour/Lib Dem view, occasionally seeing the Tory view as well. People are completely misinformed on the whole debate, and are being kept in the dark about loads of other views.

I do disagree with Neville though.

true,ianrush88,null,null,"I don't think other teams using the chelsea strategy is going to be a big problem for us. Apart from Aston Villa, Swansea and Southampton, every team outside of the top 7 has come to anfield with a packed defence. Man United probably would have if they hadn't conceded after 5 minutes. Spurs too if they hadn't conceded after 2.

And they've all lost. Some of them thrashed, some of them close wins.

Remember when we lost to Southampton who pressed us high with a high defensive line and people were saying we'd been found out? That all teams would be doing this to us in the future? Now chelsea win a game with the polar opposite tactics and everybody's going to be using the same tactic against us?

Two things are important: one that getting an early goal ruins a parked bus. Second, that chelsea are really really good at it, at the expense of being fluent in attack. Any big man up front probably would not have worked - Diego Costa had no success midweek, neither did Yaya Toure in february when City lost 0-1 at home. Chelsea love teams to launch it into the box, they invite it in the way we did under Houllier.

In my opinion we just have to have full faith in the way we play and keep doing it. As discussed on MNF, we stopped doing that second half and lumped crosses in.

What's your qualification that means your opinion on what's ""probable and likely"" is more reliable than any of the bunch of disagreeing experts? :) 

&gt; That aside, and back to my earlier point. The SNP is playing politics with the Euro by sticking to the line about not really having to adopt it. Meanwhile they sign over all the sovereignty.

Again, they're pushing for a sterling currency union, which has led to them being criticised (on both sides of the debate) for wanting to leave fiscal sovereignty in London (not Brussels). This isn't a hidden fact.

But to your wider point, yes, I believe the SNP *are* playing politics. Were the public opinion of the Euro more positive, I'm pretty sure that's the course the SNP would still be pursuing. Their wish to retain sterling is primarily a ""don't scare the horses"" move. 

&gt; Probability does not suggest that a new joiner is going to get better terms than the last batch of members to get in. Probablity does not suggest that Scotland is likely to unique terms over and above 25 other members who don't have opt outs.

Again, it's this distinction between ""new"" and ""continuing"" that's yet to be resolved.  Do I think Scotland will get to keep the UK rebate? No. Do I think a Schengen opt-out is achievable? Absolutely. Possibly even tied to requiring that if the UK ever commit to going in, Scotland must do so also.  

If Scotland launches its own currency, does it get a Euro opt-out? No chance.  If a sterling zone is formed is it more likely that A) Scotland will be excluded from the EU? Or B) There'll be some wiggle room put in place requiring Scotland to agree to join in principle at some point in the future either through an intermediate transition to its own currency, or through sterling convergence (if that ever happens)?

Of course the greater point is that no modern nation can effectively retain all its sovereignty. But it does get the opportunity to choose where it shares it and for what purposes. ",0,1398777553,null,0,false,0,ch501ip,t3_249d9a,t1_ch501ip,t1_ch4zi98,null,1433572165,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

You adored her and she adored you; you sang about her and she gave you gifts and trinkets, silver cups and medals and she made you feel 10 feet high. All the other guys were in awe of you and your prowess. She stayed with you the good times and the great times and her glory brought you fame and adulation and self worth. 

She was glory itself and she loved you!

Then she left. There wasn't an argument. There was no note. There was no warning.

She didn't leave overnight but she did leave quickly enough. 

She started to flirt in other directions, first with some North London southern pansy, then with some thick Yorkshire thug and then.....and then with your nemesis, the kid who'd always openly hated you, was jealous of you, used to bad mouth you but who secretly wanted to be you and they wanted nothing more than to steal your girl....and they did :( 

She could have left you for a number of other guys but why did she have to go with your nemesis, your arch enemy number 1? Why! Why!! WHY!!!!!

At first you thought it was a fling, you had a row, she was pissed off that you weren't taking her on all those European adventures that she loved and she wanted to hurt you, then you thought that she must be really mad but that no way would it last with that 'knobhead' down the Lancs.

Slowly, her glory, that was all yours started to shift to 'him'. YOU thought you could win her back at first but year after year would go by and even though now and again she'd call you and maybe meet for coffee and it'd feel like old times, it never really was. She would  have to run off to 'him' and you'd be sat there in the coffee shop with your latte and your laments.

Over teh years you start to feel less and less of a man everytime you see her with him, laughing and playful, you'd put on a good front, you slept with her cousins a few times and even had a few wild nights with her European cousins over in Dortmund and Istanbul. Great great nights, sexy girls but in your heart of hearts there was always her, lurking, lingering, a reminder of your former self, that carefree, strong youthful Adonis you were but were no longer. 

And then, in your old age, along comes a leprechaun, a singing dancing merry man of the Emerald Isle with magic in his finger tips and honey on his tongue and he started to rebuild you. He gave you back your young legs and your youthful arrogance but you got to keep your age earned wisdom. 

He promised you the promised land, though we didn't really believe, not when he first arrived.

Then all of a sudden, SHE was there, she'd come to see you and she hadn't aged a day, she was as beautiful as ever and she was flashing you that smile and she was coy and she was teasing and could it be that she really wanted you back? after all these years? Just when you'd just about given up all hope of ever seeing her outside of your nostalia, there she was. She's at the door, dressed in her glad rags and she's waiting for you to take her dancing again....

Then, whirlwind, then romance, then happiness, then joy, then fear, then nerves, then agony, and then only HOPE.

Only hope is left. There's another guy on the scene now, she ditched your old old nemesis for this new richer nemesis but she's not happy. He's too arrogant and brash and full of himself. No smoothness, no romance, no elegance, no real love. She misses the real love you used to share but she's so used to the high-life and can't make up her mind.

You ask her to meet you on May 11th to run away together. She said she will talk it over with her sisters, Clotho, Atropos and Lachesis and seek their counsel and blessing.

Now, nothing to be done but to wait.

I'd actually be giving them a lot of credit for their humility if they actually admitted they were wrong. As it is I expect them to fully turn on the austerity tap again if they win another election so they have to go.

Do we trust that they'll continue to lie to the public while doing the sensible thing or do we believe they will revert to type after a renewed mandate? Did they dust down Keynes these past 2/3 years because they realised their mistake or because they needed to in order to win an election?

true,DaceX,lfc55,,"Few things been on my mind.

1. I hate losing to Chelsea more than I hate losing against anyone other than United, but the level of abject dejection online and amongst my red friends seems a bit excessive. I genuinely believe that we are still favourites for the title. I am not saying we will win it because I have no idea how the lads will respond to Sundays disappointment, but we are competing for the title against a team in Man City who have time after time after time crumbled under expectancy in recent years. I think disappointment is fine, its encouraging... but absolute dejection and resignation are over the top

2. I hate Chelsea's tactics, but I think we were naive on Sunday. In summary, we went chasing a game we actually didnt need to win. If we had drawn we would still be in the drivers seat for the title, so the frustration and impatience that crept in to our play from early on where unnecessary . My main concern is that the lads come away from that game feeling like they were cheated out of a result when in actual fact I believe Sunday is potentially a result which we can learn and grow from more than any other this season. Yes Chelsea were utterly disgusting but we need to play against teams who set up like this and get results, starting on Monday night. I don't want a Wenger scenario where by he claims a moral victory when his team is out fought and out thought. Maximum points every game is all that should matter.

3. The fact that we expected to beat Chelsea shows how far we have come, and I feel like the disappointment we all feel is actually a positive reflection on how well the team are playing this year. Also let us not lose perspective, we lost to a club with players far more expensive, well paid and experienced..... a coach far more experienced than ours in matches of this calibre. I cant help but feel encouraged that we forced the ""mighty"" Chelsea to resort to Sam Allardyce shithousing and every dirty tactic under the sun to beat us, and really they only managed it because Stevie slipped. I think if it weren't for the timing of the loss we would all feel a lot more positive from this result.

4. Liverpool Football Club are 2 points clear at the top of the league, with 2 games to play. I will never ever get bored of typing, reading, saying or hearing those words.

I am just incredibly excited to be in the conversation at this point of a season, I simply can not wait for Monday because if we win that, its going down to the very last day. Liverpool competing for the title on the last day of the season! For me its all about which you prefer, the disappointment of finishing 7th with nothing to play for??

The other point that is often brought up about monarchical control is that the leader of the party wishing to form a government must ask for the permission of the queen on order to go ahead. Although this sounds dodgy, due to the royal family being reliant on taxes for its continued existence and the government controlling the taxes, any foul play from the royal family could be democratically suppressed.

I think it is hilarious how **most** of the Chelsea fans are calling **all** of the Liverpool fans hypocrites. Please look back at the Crystal Palace and West Ham (defeat and draw) post match threads and look at many of the people on /r/chelseafc bitch and moan about their negative tactics and whatnot. Now you're praising it... quite hypocritical IMO.

Now onto the match, which I can say Chelsea thoroughly deserved at least a point and probably all 3. We see teams time after time set up like Chelsea did to compensate for the difference in quality. Chelsea did it brilliantly and if the game had another 90 minutes to it, I personally don't think we would have scored. It just wasn't our day and Chelsea defended brilliantly.

The only tactics that really bothered me on Sunday were the time wasting tactics that Atkinson should have dealt with in the first 10 minutes. I can't find it now but I saw an article somewhere that said that 4 of the first 10 minutes were dead ball situations... that's not right and takes away from the game. Schwarzer, Cole, and Ivanovic should have been carded or warned to the fullest extent for the multiple times they used various time wasting techniques. It was sad to watch and I don't think it should be a part of the game.

Lastly, despite being an excellent manager, one of the best in the game, Mourinho is a cunt. It's what fuels him to give him and his team that competitive edge. It works but he is a cunt.

Now I'll probably be downvoted from both sides but fuck it. I hope everyone reads this and stops being 'fucking hypocrites'.

This was enough to allow the game to be released in several countries, but some countries like Germany wanted still more censorship.

Jose does this against other big teams when he is playing them in high pressure situations. It is certainly effective, as I've been trying to make clear. I just think it shows a lack of courage and actually a tactical weakness that he has to revert to such a drastic style to win these games. He ought to be able to make tweaks to his typical system and win, but instead he tosses offense out the window and waits for someone to make a mistake. 

Again, this is effective, but it is not typical for other top clubs. Chelsea had maybe 3 total counter attacks that had anywhere near the pace required to even be considered such (the 2 goals and one other where Ba could've played in Schurrle but he massively fucked it up), and the 2 goals could barely be considered that as Liverpool played you into 1v1 situations. 

In any case, the match is over, and I accept the loss. I have no one to blame but Liverpool and their players. But Mourinho deserves virtually none of the praise, in my opinion. Your defense was constantly under siege and the fact that it withstood Liverpool's efforts had nothing to do with tactics and 100% to do with amazing individual performances.

The problem that I have with him is his inability to hold concentration for 90 minutes. it has not developed all season, and I feel that he is a serious downgrade on Caulker. Sure he's not a bad defender, but he continually makes monumental mistakes, some that go unpunished, some unfortunately not. In my opinion he has not developed enough in his first season for a player that turns 25 before the end of the year. especially considering that he has played almost 30 games this season, i feel he is no better off now than he was at the start of the season.

I'm far from a typical Briton, and I listen to a lot of North American stuff. It's only since listening to Rick Mercer that I could tell a Canadian accent, and more specifically a Newfie accent. Most British won't be able to tell the difference between US American and a Canadian.

In the US, to most people in the UK there are probably two or three accents: general, southern and CWOFFEE. It's weird how there's a racial divide along dialects in the US, though. On the radio you can sometimes tell if it's a black person speaking because of AAVE. 

Personally, I pay attention to US media more than the average person, so can tell 'Southern', Boston/New England, A few accents around New York, like Staten Island and Queens (Chris Walken) , but anything West of the is an absolute mystery.

In the last six years we have grown our UK office to be over 60 people with over 70% of the employees being British. 

As for the not withstanding part, that is a big part. I pay substantial tax's with no recourse to any sort of benefits outside of the NHS meaning I am subsidising people here, I'm not complaining about this, but rather explaining. 

I am about to take the Life in the UK test as my life has developed greatly in this country (English SO) and we plan on staying and continue paying into the economy here.

I understand that many AUS and NZ cousins come for working visa's and I think that is a good thing, many British people go to AUS and NZ for working visa's as well. 

Lastly, whilst I do enjoy the favourable exchange rates (especially now) when I go back to Canada to visit, it is not a primary motivation for my or the company I work for. The company is concerned with continued growth and has opened offices in many other countries as well.

true,stevemegson,null,null,"I suppose you'd end up with a stalemate between Parliament and a hypothetical rogue monarch who tries to use prerogative powers. The monarch could refuse to grant assent to anything that Parliament tries to pass and could appoint a Prime Minister of their choosing. However, Parliament could refuse to pass any bill that the new PM introduces on behalf of our new dictator.

You could take the view that the monarch is now unable to perform their royal duties and attempt to appoint a Regent in their place, but most of the people who can take the decision to appoint a Regent are appointed through royal prerogative, so a dictator-king could replace them to prevent that. 

Theoretically they could withdraw the right of the government to command the armed forces, and then issue orders themselves, though we might hope that orders to kill anyone that the monarch doesn't like would be refused as unlawful.

If, on the other hand, the monarch was acting to remove a rogue government which no longer had public support, there's less chance of starting a civil war. Royal assent could be withheld to stop the rogue government passing any laws, and provided some opposition remains within Parliament a more sane PM could be appointed. The monarch can no longer force a general election, but it's likely that you'd be able to find a majority of MPs willing to pass a vote of no confidence and trigger one in order to preserve some chance of being re-elected. If not, and public opinion justified it, you might be able to resort to commissioning rogue MPs into the army, disqualifying them from being an MP and triggering a by-election.

Too bad the tributes paid to lives that relegate these thrones to lives spent valuing the runners-up, are known to be neither fleeting nor desirable.

I would imagine that Ledley would know a few players that he knows he can ask and they will say yes and come in and play both active (Daws, Lennon, Crouchy) and retired (Anderton, Ginola, Sherringham).

Now obviously Ledley is going to have better knowledge of players that he actually played with whether it be long or short term (Rafa may not have been on the pitch a great deal with Ledders but they were teammates for a couple seasons and know each other), but i think the club will also try to make sure that there are ""club legends"" available to play to ensure that the supporters have as much incentive as possible to come and watch the match.

A match like this (especially given that we aren't playing another major team like when United brought in Juve to play in the Neville testimonial) has a high probabiliy of the club trotting out anyone of note to play......i would wager you will see Les and Freund around if not on the pitch, Hoddle is managing one of the squads. 

Ledley's XI playing in a testimonial is going to get supporters regardless, but if you trot out the club ""legends"" in some way or another you ensure that the match is sold out....and you get to charge more than if you were doing ""Ledley's XI"" vs the U21s.

Thing that can be tricky is active players who are on other teams need to get cleared by their team to show up....so Rafa would need to be cleared by HSV, Keano and JD would need to be cleared by the MLS (seems unlikely) etc...

2.	When trying to resurrect the Master, Lucy (his wife from Sound of Drums) hurled a Potion of Death at him.  The Master survived but it was not a complete resurrection. This allowed him to use his life force in unconventional ways such as the Superman leap and shooting energy from his hands. It is because he was an incomplete resurrection that he could not regenerate.

I very sincerely doubt FSG will sanction a purchase that huge for someone who isn't an established marquee signing, even if he is a very hot young prospect who can play right away.

did you not see Suarez rise from the dead on easter day? seriously saying that is just double standards. every team does what chelsea does, tactics and player behaviour.

He needs to stay because he offers a cover for pace but he's also shown he can deal with stronger players (see everton match away) through technique rather than brute strength. 

Finally this whole thing about his 'mistakes' - which i'm actually struggling to remember from before his injury but I'll humour you - they are born from his style of play which is conducive to a fast counter attack. Complaining about vlad's mistakes is like complaining when hugo rushes at a player 25 yards out, gets beaten and gives up a goal.

If I have to explain this in greater depth, you clearly don't get it and/or your intelligence is questionable.

But I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and do so anyway.

I can't have more than one ticket to myself, and I wouldn't want or need one. My point is that long serving blues who were here when we were shit should have priority over those who weren't.

And they do, by and large due to the loyalty points system.

That said, as prices get increased year on year, as they are, their loyalty points will become an irrelevance if they can no longer afford to go, that's when the plastics and glory hunters will take their place, and dilute our support to the point where our crowd resembles nothing like it did in 2008 for example.

I don't want to see our match day crowd go the way of Stamford Bridge and Old Trafford, the soul of this club is its fanbase, and I don't want that to change drastically.

Of course, if the club keeps ticket prices reasonable, and the pre takeover blues can afford to go, then I wouldn't care much if the new fans (whatever their motives) took up seats in the new expansion of the ground.

But the ticket prices aren't reasonable, and they're getting worse. People have been priced out, and more and more are following their footsteps.

So in essence, the recent increase in demand from new fans is forcing out the old fans, for it is their new increased demand for tickets which allows the club to justify ticket price increases, without that increase in demand the club wouldn't sell out the stadium as people are priced out, and thus would be more inclined to keep ticket prices reasonable.

That is my point, and the primary reason for disquiet.",0,1398785622,null,0,false,0,ch53dx7,t3_247v2c,t1_ch53dx7,t1_ch515d4,null,1433573810,-1,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,-1

The NHS actually used a lot of the stuff as a cleaning agent in hospitals at one point. The government should have no say in if a pub, for instance, allows vapers. 

At that point though I would have to say we are getting into an odd area, would we be able to ban people with too much deodorant/cologne, or people who stink? They probably cause more annoyance to people than vapers do and the health risk is the same. 

The thing being discussed here might be about second hand stuff, I'm not sure.

true,PJHart86,,Belfast,"There's a fair bit of institutionalized racism in Australia, arguably worse than even what UKIP are proposing:

&gt;Section 51(xxvi) of the Australian Constitution, commonly called 'the race power', is the subsection of Section 51 of the Australian Constitution granting the Australian commonwealth power to make special laws for people of any race.

&gt;As initially drafted, s 51(xxvi) empowered the Parliament to make laws with respect to: ""The people of any race, other than the aboriginal race in any State, for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws"". The Australian people voting at the 1967 referendum deleted the words in italics.

&gt;Edmund Barton had argued in 1898 that s 51(xxvi) was necessary to enable the Commonwealth to ""regulate the affairs of the people of coloured or inferior races who are in the Commonwealth"".[1] The section was intended to enable the Commonwealth to pass laws restricting such migrant labourers such as the Chinese and Kanakas.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_51(xxvi)_of_the_Australian_Constitution

&gt;The Immigration Restriction Act 1901 was one of the first pieces of legislation passed by the Australian Government to deal with immigration. It restricted the migration of non-British peoples to Australia and symbolised the birth of what came to be known as the White Australia policy.[9] The Act prohibited the entry of any person who failed to write out a passage of 50 words in any European language as dictated by a Customs officer.[10]

&gt;Parliamentary debate over the legislation was not about whether it was morally wrong to restrict non-white immigration. Senators and members were almost exclusively concerned with whether the dictation test would achieve the objective of prohibiting non-white immigration to Australia without being seen to contradict the British Government’s stated commitment to non-discrimination on racial grounds.[11]

Well that's where we just fundamentally disagree.

&gt;You shouldn't be asking whether I would want to give business to a shop like that. You should be asking why any business owner with such attitudes would want to provide a public service at all.

Which is exactly what I would be thinking. It is stupid and deplorable to open up a business and refuse service for such reasons, but I believe it should be the owner's choice. 

It's their business and property and should be treat as such, in the same way you can refuse access to your home to anyone on whatever grounds you want.

&gt;Yes, let's go and invest thousands opening a sandwich shop in a BNP stronghold to compete against the highly successful sandwich shop which refuses to serve 1-5% of the local population. That's a great business plan that is.

People set up new businesses all the time when successful competition already exists, so I'm not really sure what your point here is. And it wouldn't necessarily be necessary for someone to go and invest in a new business anyway because chances are there would already be existing competition that would love to take the business of the more successful shop.

There is also always the option of moving elsewhere, although like you said, not everyone is going to be living there by choice.

&gt;You are suggesting that it's acceptable for women and certain minorities who live in these areas to jump through hoops to access public facing services that are freely accessible to the majority.

Anyone, not just women and minorities.

So I asked him, how do I find out how much they are charged so that I know whether or not I'm being ripped off?  He didn't know the answer to that unfortunately and suggested that I contact Mastercard.

I then attempted to contact Mastercard and got led down a series of automated-FAQs and never got to actually talk to a real person.  I kinda feel like I'm getting nowhere with this...

&gt;rotect minorities from mistreatment and making sure people are free to go about their lives, regardless of their race, sex, sexual orientation etc.

Unless that minority is an individual who wishes to not do business with certain people/races/religions/whatever.. Then they can't go about their daily lives.

*Acc vs Inc*

Acc is ""Accumulation"", Inc is ""Income"". There's no difference in the underlying investments, but when dividends are paid out they're automatically reinvested for ""acc"" and given to you as cash for ""inc"". If you're doing buy and hold, then ""acc"" is preferable. If you're living on the growth then ""inc"" might be more for you. 

*Equity percentage*

So these funds invest in a whole load of things. One of the bigger distinctions is whether you're investing in bonds or companies. Bonds are loans to big reliable people like governments. They give lower returns but are more reliable. The percentage describes the split between the investment in companies and in bonds. 100% equity is no bonds, 80% equity is 20% in bonds, 60% equity is 40% in bonds, etc.

So 100% equity is the more risky, but possibly higher return investment and 20% equity is the lower risk but likely lower return investment. What's best for you depends on how long you're investing for and your attitude to risk.

Going even further back Yorkshire made up the bulk of the Kingdom of Northumbria and then Viking Jorvik until the unification of the country under Wessex in the 10th centry so in some form or another it's always been a major and distinct area of the country.

That the state should have no role in protecting a persons rights in that respect. Last time we did that we had tacit racism and active exclusion of people on the nature of who they were.

Yes, and that's balanced against what the business owners want. I think it's a good tradeoff, but it's ridiculous to ignore the fact that it is still a tradeoff. People draw different lines in the sand where they think the state should be involved, and what power the state should have over individuals. That is not the same thing as defining what you think is right and wrong.

The B&amp;B case is a classic example of this. The owners didn't want the gay couple sharing a bed under their own roof. There's a difference between saying ""I'm fine with them not allowing it"" and saying ""I think they should have the right to not allow it"".

true,Chesney1995,,Cheltenham Town,"Signings:

**Jamie Cureton:** 5/10 - Looked good against Burton, until he dislocated his shoulder. Generally below expectations (but certainly not helped by the midfield) but picked up a decent partnership with Harrison towards the end.

**Matt Richards:** 2/10 - Not at all a good replacement for Marlon Pack. I suspect he is the player that wasn't trying in training. Offload in the summer, please.

**Craig Braham-Barrett:** 3/10 - Not good enough. I appreciate the philosophy of bringing up players from the non-league with a point to prove, but this one hasn't worked out.

**Ashley Vincent:** 1/10 - Is he even still alive?

**Terry Gornell:** 5/10 - Looked good earlier in the season, form dropped off and then he disappeared from the squad completely.

**Troy Brown:** 7/10 - Our best signing this season. Looks solid at the back and showing good potential.

Departures:

Can't blame anyone for **Marlon Pack**'s departure, everyone knew it was coming and he wanted to play in League One. A big miss though, never truly replaced (mainly down to Matt Richard's performances)

The big ones are **Russ Penn** and **Keith Lowe.** Both to York. They changed York's season around, and I still don't understand the point of selling them. We need leadership (30+ points dropped from winning positions is unforgivable) and have especially lacked it since their departures.

Another one I failed to understand at the time is **Billy Jones.** Especially after Craig Braham-Barrett proved not good enough. Although Billy has ended up in non-league football, maybe Yates was right when he said he hit a wall in his development.

The season:

A massive disappointment. After two playoff campaigns we expected to finally bring League One football back to Cheltenham, or at least get close in doing so. Things started off with us dropping a 2-0 lead at home and it set the tone for the season, really. Poor results and dropped leads, exacerbated by us collapsing when we concede a goal (4 goals in 7 minutes vs Chesterfield, and 3 goals in 2 minutes at AFC Wimbledon spring to mind) has led to an incredibly frustrating season.

The Scott Brown interview after Saturday's game seemed to explain our woes. He said that players have openly admitted to not trying in training, and one of them played in Saturday's game. Farcical.

We have shown glimpses of quality, and this is a side I believe was capable of top 10, possibly top 7. The performances of Byron Harrison have been good, but he, as well as the other strikers, have been let down by the midfield. Overall, I give this season a **3/10.** With the tagline *""At least we aren't Torquay/Northampton.""*",0,1398790413,null,0,false,0,ch55pn8,t3_24821u,t1_ch55pn8,t3_24821u,null,1433574906,2,false,LeagueTwo,t5_2wn55,2

true,CastrosExplodinCigar,,Randalstown,"Workers where the pineapple is picked are paid very little. There are many pineapple fields, with pineapple trees as far as the eye can see. Workers may be paid as little as $1-$2 per day for a 12 hour shift. Wages for the entire work force may come to less than $200 a day but the produce picked is worth thousands.

Thousands of pineapples are picked every day and sent all around the globe, shops, like Tescos buy in bulk from the international fruit market (These take places in big big warehouses) and produce in sold by metric tonne, not by pound. The Pineapples are then sent to stores. The pineapple you eat on a Wednesday, may have only been picked on a Monday. It's an amazing process.

They can charge you 75 pence because they may have only bought it (once the tonnage is sorted out) for 70pence or even 80 pence but they are also getting you in to buy other stuff to go with your pineapple, gammon for example.

The worst example of this is bars, the coke you buy with a vodka and coke costs 12 pence (when I was a bar manager a few years back), the bar sells it for 1.40. The Smirnoff may only have a profit of 5 to 10 pence (Before the tax, wages, insurance, heat etc) but the bar makes their money on the mixer. Same with pineapples, they may make a tiny profit but the other stuff you are buying, they make more profit on that. It's called a loss leader.

A great example of loss leaders are razors (the cartridge costs more than the razor, often the razor handle is given away free but the cartridge and blades cost ridiculous amounts of money) and printers.

You may have already seen it and reached the conclusion that this place is full of foreigners who have never been to a match.  That's one way to look at it, and the stats back you up.

Another way to look at it is that you have all kinds of fans here: Mancs, Yanks, Norwegians, Glaswegians, you name it. People that go to every match, home fans, occasional matchgoers, purely armchair. Post-Mansour, pre-Mansour, pre-Shinawatra, pre-Lee, *maybe* even pre-Swales (lucky bastards).

This represents partly the demographic of reddit, and this reddit demographic could skew your view and make it look like the club doesn't belong to Manchester anymore.  On the one hand reddit doesn't give a clear picture, but on the other hand the club is undoubtedly gaining in popularity around the world.

So what is a despairing Manc to do?  You can either ape King Cnut and command the tide to stop it's advance, or you can help to channel the advancing waters into something you're more comfortable with.  That is either attempt to call enough people plastic cunts that you will turn off the hordes of people that are being drawn to the club, or you can attempt to help those people appreciate Mancunian culture.

I understand how you feel.  I'm a Manc living in Los Angeles so I probably have more experience with our overseas supporters than a lot of my mates back home (plus I'm a huge redditor... like way too much), and what I've experienced is mostly people with a thirst for understanding.

There are bellends that just want to latch on to a winning brand and don't give a shit for what the club represents - they can go fuck themselves - but my experience has mostly been that people are keen to learn from the natives.  They don't want to finally show up at the Etihad after scraping together the considerable amount of money to make the pilgrimmage only to discover that they look like a twat and everyone is laughing at them.  They want to ""get it"".

If the new fans are coming (and they are) I also want them to get it, but calling them plastic cunts doesn't really help.

If you've got any ideas on how we can infuse this sub with more Mancunian flavour PM me, I'd love to hear your thoughts.

&gt;[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom) [David Cameron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cameron) condemned the protests, saying ""violence is absolutely unjustified in those and in other circumstances.""  MP Naomi Long said that Northern Ireland is facing a ""an incredibly volatile and extremely serious situation"".   She also called on Cameron to intervene after a police car outside her office was firebombed with a policewoman escaping injury in early December.  On 13 January, she said that the party had no regrets in its decision to limit the days the Union Jack would fly over the city hall.  First Minister [Peter Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Robinson_(politician\)) said on 13 January that the political process was the only way forward in developing cordial relations. ""We took some difficult decisions, some might say historic decisions to build a shared society in Northern Ireland. I think it is important to tell the wider community in Northern Ireland and our friends in the rest of the United Kingdom that we are not giving up on that. We are very much of the view that we are determined that we build the kind of society where everybody can have a peaceful and stable existence."" He and Deputy First Minister [Martin McGuinness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_McGuinness) were due to meet the British and Irish governments the following week and that Robinson would make it ""very clear"" about the condemnation of the wider Northern Ireland community for the violence.  Robinson added that Northern Ireland's international image was getting damaged by the violence.

&gt; In the course of a short conversation, I simply made the point that people were entitled to their personal preferences. It is morally acceptable to prefer heterosexuality over homosexuality, or vice versa. Most of us prefer one or the other.

*Do* we, though? If I'm a man attracted to women, does that really mean the same as 'I *prefer* heterosexuality'? 
 
The way I seem to experience things, anyway, is more that some people have a kind of sexual aura (for want of a better word) and some people don't, and it just happens to be women who have this aura in my eyes. I don't know if I *prefer* anything to anything else, it's more like a difference between 'sexy' and 'neutral'. And maybe 'sexier' isn't entirely the same as 'better'? 

Meanwhile, there are none the less lots of people, generally older and/or living in less diverse locales, who are not homophobic but have some mixed feelings about homosexuality, not racist but have some mixed feelings about race, etc, etc. A lot of these people are worried about being labelled as haters if they express their mixed feelings or even ask, in good faith, a 'stupid question'. 

When this sort of person sees this kind of sensationalism around someone similar to them, I think it probably makes them feel less welcome, and if this goes on, that's how you end up with a 'silent majority' of conservative people which politicians can tap if they want a bit of a putsch. You can be 'the one party who listens to people like us'. 

Which is exactly what UKIP are doing, even if this one bloke has been unfairly treated by the Sun. It's also what the Sun are doing most of the time, and it won't be long until they find a gay person to make into a monster. I'm not sure where that leaves us, except it pays to think about nuance.

I also don't think you understand the importance of the public sphere versus the private. Conducting business is not a private affair - it's offering a service.

If they were just a couple that was asked, as a favour , to let two gay people sleep in their house and refused. Then that's a private exchange. In this case they are not, they offering a service as a business and are registered with the government to do so. 

Because they operate in the public sphere they have to make the ability to purchase their services fit under a criteria that all people can have access to. They can restrict patrons on conditions that the patron on conditions that changeable - but not on conditions that deny their essential human rights to be who they are. So you can throw people out for being rowdy ( the patron can choose to be or not to be) or on lack of payment ( they could have paid) - but not because they're gay ( because they can't be un-gay or if they're black - un-black).

The problem with Liverpool's attack as is, is that we lack a tall, strong presence up front that can be useful in these types of games. Carroll might not have scored in this game, but he would've given us a realistic chance of hitting someone who could make an impact in the box, which would've forced Chelsea to come out to try to stop those balls in.

With the limitations of the current team, I think our best option was, exactly as Neville pointed out, getting the ball to Suárez' feet in the box or around the area, where he could do his magic. I don't think that's impossible if you play with a bit of patience and composure. We could've treated it almost like handball; pass the ball to each other around the area and try to get a ball in to the line player (Suárez or Sturridge), pass the ball out to wingers moving into the field (could be Sterling, Suárez or Sturridge) after moving defenders out of position and having the occasional long shot (not as many as we did have, we don't have the players to rely on it as is - Gerrard can still shoot decently, but not as before).

Chelsea did exactly what they needed to stop our swift attacks and the only real weapon we had left up top was Suárez, who did not recieve the ball in enough dangerous positions to really make an impact.",0,1398793096,null,0,false,0,ch570sn,t3_247xcb,t1_ch570sn,t1_ch4zy7m,null,1433575522,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

You're referring to the escort of Russian ships? It wasn't anything like Russia probing defenses but an organized escort. 

&gt;Defender sailed 700 miles from Portsmouth to the north east of Scotland on 19 December 2013 to meet the Russian task group of 6 ships including an aircraft carrier and accompany them down the east coast of Scotland. The vessels were held back by bad weather and had anchored in the Moray Firth.

true,shotglass21,eng-GreaterLondon,London AKA civilisation,"&gt; And this is something that a society should try and prevent, not easy but laws just gloss over the fact... the society still has the people with these attitudes .. Attitudes that I would rather be in the open and challenged by the community than simply enforced by law via state violence.

This is more of an argument against hate-speech laws, which I am incidentally against. As I stated earlier, I believe people should have the right to express their hateful views, unless they are inciting violence. You also seem to be saying that if such anti discrimination laws are in place, it restricts us from actually discussing these important sociological issues; however this is demonstrably false. 

In 1965, the [race relation act] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_Relations_Act_1965) was enacted so that racial minorities were treated fairly under the law, it was later amended in 1968 to include employment and housing. However despite this legislation, there were many discussions on the issue of race and nationality in the UK, so much so that we now live in one of the most racially tolerant countries in the world. The same can be said of gay rights as well, the gay rights movement has paved the way for the equality of sexual minorities; this wouldn't of happened if people hadn't of fought for gay equality for over half a century, and thankfully we live in a country where such things were allowed to be openly discussed.
&gt; I don't have the right to purchase something at say.. A racist butches or a Xenophobic persons bakery.

The point is the business owner's political beliefs shouldn't prevent a member of the public from receiving services due to their identity. This goes back to the 'No blacks No Irish No dogs' in which the owner's beliefs trump those of the minorities rights.

&gt; Yet you are perfectly happy and advocate for taking peoples ability to freely associate.

The freedom of association/assembly has absolutely nothing to do with refusing services to minorities, it involves the right of people to come together to form groups, such as politcal parties, religous groups etc. 

&gt; I'm no expert on Jim crow laws but they seem to be Government forced/Mandated segregation correct? Given my (and presumably the UKIP councillors) respect for free association why would we possibly support that ?

The jim crow laws were enacted both privately and publically. There was government mandated segregation, one example of this would be the segregation on public buses. Then there was the private side of it, where business owners would have the liberty to discriminate against ethnic minorities, this of course was superseded by the civil rights act of 1965. This is why UKIP pisses me off, they are making the same arguments of economic 'liberty' that the pro-segregationists were making just so they can justify their bigotry; instead of learning from history, we are repeating it.

true,IanCal,eng-manchester,Manchester - City of Science,"&gt; I understand the argument you're making. I think it's a complete misunderstanding of how human rights work and the role of the state in enforcement. Human rights are normative - we agree that they are core values and we have them as part of our laws. 

Right, but if I don't want to date someone because they're black I'm not breaking the law. We don't draw the line there, do we? But other people want it at a different place. There's no clearly defined point that everyone agrees simply must exist. You cannot argue harm in this, because it makes no sense in the discussion. Every new law or role the state takes is *always* a tradeoff, and a tradeoff of two different issues. One is cost/benefit tradeoff, another is giving more control to a third party (the state). It's incredibly important to remember that these are distinct.

&gt; If they were just a couple that was asked, as a favour , to let two gay people sleep in their house and refused. Then that's a private exchange. In this case they are not, they offering a service as a business and are registered with the government to do so.

Again, I'm not libertarian but I think they'd disagree that they should have to be registered with the government just to conduct business. 

&gt; I also don't think you understand the importance of the public sphere versus the private.

*Again*, I'm not arguing for this, I'm trying to define the distinction that people are making. Secondly, there's no clear line between public and private.

&gt;  So you can throw people out for being rowdy ( the patron can choose to be or not to be) or on lack of payment ( they could have paid) - but not because they're gay ( because they can't be un-gay or if they're black - un-black).

This isn't really relevant to the point but:

The law isn't quite like that. You can throw someone out if they have a disability that means they're very loud, but only if other patrons complain. You can also fire/not hire someone if they wear a niqab *if* it gets in the way of the job (like teaching people a language). You can't refuse someone a position because they're over-qualified but you can refuse to hire an actor that's black for the role of a KKK member in a film or refuse to hire someone in a wheelchair as a bricklayer.",0,1398793543,null,0,false,0,ch578su,t3_249ne2,t1_ch578su,t1_ch56hhf,null,1433575627,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"You're still not understanding the division between public and private spheres: 

&gt;I don't want to date someone because they're black 

Private sphere. You're exercise of your choice. There's no public engagement. That person isn't selling a date on the open market as a regulated business. You aren't buying it. Nothing to do with the state.

&gt;I'm not libertarian but I think they'd disagree that they should have to be registered with the government just to conduct business. 

They have to be, they pay taxes and want protection of the law. Unless they want to live the Randroid dream of living in an island of themselves, which is sophistry at its best. 

&gt;You can throw someone out if they have a disability that means they're very loud

Not if they have no control over their loudness. You would have to assume they have agency. Which is how it works when people deal with mentally ill people - also there's the whole issue of public safety. 

&gt;Secondly, there's no clear line between public and private.

There's always a line. It's called the harm principle. You should really read up concepts of liberty espoused by John Rawls and Isaiah Berlin, two very different but intriguing views on these issues.

&gt;You can also fire/not hire someone if they wear a niqab if it gets in the way of the job (like teaching people a language)

This one is a being argued. However, teaching someone language isn't that condition, the case is made about identity and safety. Again - it's something that has to be a balance of harms. See above. ~

&gt;but you can refuse to hire an actor that's black for the role of a KKK member in a film or refuse to hire someone in a wheelchair as a bricklayer.

Again these are interesting tests, the first one would be a very close thing and you could argue it either way, the second would be again under the harm principle. 

Finally this: 

&gt;There's no clearly defined point that everyone agrees simply must exist. You cannot argue harm in this, because it makes no sense in the discussion. Every new law or role the state takes is always a tradeoff, and a tradeoff of two different issues. One is cost/benefit tradeoff, another is giving more control to a third party (the state). It's incredibly important to remember that these are distinct.

It's not a question of benefits/trade-offs in that way at all. It's a social contract with a normative base. Human rights are the normative concept because we have, at various points during our history, decided that those were the values that were going to underpin the social contract between citizen and state. 

That means - things that are human rights are part of our both our legal and moral framework. Where the argument is , how those are applied in each case. Discrimination against you for your essential nature - for who you are , you race and your sexuality is no longer acceptable. It's that simple. That's how we know it's bad. That's why we fought long and hard to make sure it doesn't happen. 

If you partake in a public activity that interacts with the society around you and other people - you are expected to comply to the basic normative framework it provides you. The balance is how much your rights, the rights of others and the rights of collective society can achieve. 

In this balancing act it is just as important to have freedom to exercise your right something  but equally as important to have freedom from people trying to take away yours = especially in the public sphere

Bigotry in the form you have described is the act of taking away rights from people in the public sphere. It was evil when it existed in the 1950s and 1960s - it is evil now.

&gt;__Afro-Brazilian__ or __African Brazilian__ refers to a [Brazilian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil) national with [African](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa) ancestry. The term does not have widespread usage in Brazil, where people with noticeable African ancestry are generally referred to as *preto* (""[black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people#Brazil)"") or *[pardo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardo)* ([multiracial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-race_Brazilian) or ""[brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_people#Pardos_in_Brazil)"").   These two categories are among five color categories used by the Brazilian Census, along with *[branco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Brazilian)* (""white""), *[amarelo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Brazilian)* (""yellow"", East Asian) and *[indígena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_in_Brazil)* (Amerindian).  In 2010, 7.6% of the Brazilian population, some 15 million people, self-identified themselves as ""preto"" while 43% (86 million) identified as ""pardo"". Pretos tend to be predominantly [Sub-Saharan African](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa) in ancestry, while Pardos tend to have African ancestry to a lesser degree than pretos. On average pardos are predominantly European, although all three ancestries (European, African and Native American) are often present.

The Meadows and Holyrood/Queens Park are also great spaces in the city for bigger walks. The Meadows is very busy on sunny days and there's often bbqs everywhere so be mindful if your dog likes to go for people food.

I've really never heard of anything like that happen to cats around here. As people have said, there's not really any problems with 'youths' around the area, just the odd pisshead or nutter like you would get anywhere.

&gt; The UKIP councillor's tweet was:

&gt;&gt;    ""He [Henry] should emigrate to a black country. He does not have to live with whites.""

Most people seem to be reading that as ""blacks should go back to Africa"" or similar. I'm saying we should at least give him the benefit of the doubt and read that as ""he should either put up with it or change his own circumstances so he's in a situation where this is not the case"". Ultimately he's saying that he doesn't think the majority of this country should change to suit a minority. The fact that is was remarkably similar to ""go back to your own country"" is something I'm going to put down to sheer idiocy.

If you think both statements are equally bad, then that's fair enough. I won't argue on that point.

Labour MP (Walsall/West Midlands), and former Cabinet Minister, John Stonehouse – Convicted and jailed for 7 years (served 3 years) in 1976 for Theft, Fraud, and Deception. His crimes related to a string of fraudulent business ventures and the theft of money from charities.

In 2006 newly released documents revealed that as a young MP, Stonehouse spent ten years as a paid spy for Warsaw Pact communist regimes during the height of the cold war. Had this come to light while he was in office it may well have brought down the Government of Harold Wilson, who was himself rumored to have been a KGB agent.

true,Melberger,null,null,"I realised when I decided to begin posting in here, that the likelihood is that match going fans would be in the minority, but I've been surprised by the extent.

Also the nature of the discussion, if you're critical of a player, and even detail in depth why you feel the way you do, people have a quick read, and just downvote you.

There's no humour, there doesn't seem to be much detailed and interesting discussion going on.

I think you grasp why it's difficult for a long serving blue to relate to or welcome new fans, particularly as most are only here for the success, when a blue like myself grew up during the darkest period of the club's history and suffered the ignominy of having to deal with the scum's gloating plastics, it isn't something that delights me, put it that way.

It's just really hard to stomach having similar characters attach themselves to our club, and being expected to welcome them.

It will never sit well with me, and I'll never recognise them as having anything in common with myself.

I wouldn't want to be stood next to them at a game, discussing a player. I wouldn't want to talk to them at a pub.

City is a community, there's no greater pleasure for me than talking City with a blue over a pint after a game. Reminiscing, talking about our future. Particularly at a European away fixture.

Because we have a lot in common, we share a culture, a common love.

For a lot of these new fans, we're just a passing fad, but some even have the nerve to equate their 'support' of City with ours.

I still remember being a kid in the dark days of the 90s, and having strangers come up to me in public when I was wearing my City shirt, and saying things like ""up the blues"", ""like your shirt"".

It was brilliant, in spite of our fortunes, we pulled together. That sense of community was priceless, that knowledge that everyone was in it for the right reasons.

I remember doing the same, to young lad wearing a City shirt a couple of years back; ""up the blues"" I said. He looked at me like I was from another planet. Half the time I tried I got a blank puzzled stare. I don't bother anymore.

Those are new fans, who don't get the culture. What this club is about, or used to be.

It's just not the same, and while I recognise it's a price of success, it doesn't mean I have to like it.

I won't generalise too much here, as some new fans are worse than others, but you get the gist. 

In respect of this subreddit, I really don't think I'd enjoy my time here if (as per you survey);


- Half the people here are post takeover fans.

- More than 60% of people here have never even been to a game.

- Half don't even bother to watch every game on TV.

- Of the minority who do go to games, 65% of people only get to between 1-5 games a season.


No wonder I've taken so much flak for my views on this topic! Totally different culture.

I genuinely don't think I could have much rewarding discussion or debate here. Especially on contentious topics.

I don't think it would be worth it.

Like I've said previously, I don't despise new fans who support City for the right reasons, regardless of where they're from. We all have to start somewhere.

Those people just have a different supporting culture and understanding of the club, we just don't have much in common.

My real contempt is reserved for the genuine plastic gloryhunters for whom City are nothing more than a fad, particularly if they try to equate themselves with long serving City fans.

Thanks for your post anyway mate, one of the rare posts which hasn't just glanced over everything I've written and attacked me. It's important to understand the position and experience I speak from, I know you'll have no trouble understanding this.

I'll stick around, but I'm not sure this subreddit will be my primary go to on this site.

I'm not voting for UKIP btw, i'm actually not sure who to vote for still, every party makes some good points but theres always a load of shit points that come with it.

Anyway back to the topic at hand, 5 out of the top 10 things on the front page of UK are anti-UKIP.

- 2nd position - Bath Man Makes Wanker Sign Behind Nigel Farage Live On BBC News [0:42]

- 3rd position - Ukip MEP Roger Helmer: People should be able to dislike gay people like they do different types of tea

- 4th position - William Henwood, the UKIP local election candidate who made controversial comments about Lenny Henry, has resigned from the party

- 9th position - Lewes UKIP councillor says businesses should have power to turn away women and gay people

- 10th position - Grace Dent: Is this what Ukip thinks we secretly think? That Lenny Henry should go and live in a ‘black country’? It’s time to fight back

I mean it's a bit much, especially this post since the person probably didn't even know it was Farage and just wanted to do a ""wanker"" gesture while walking past a live TV camera. I think he would have done it to anyone. He came up from behind Farage, i don't think he actually knew who it was unless he knows what Farage looks like from mostly behind, or he saw him from the front and walked right around the view to do it..

edit: Not to mention most anti UKIP posts get Reddit Gold which is just crazy.

edit 2: And to the people downvoting me why are you downvoting?(at this time i have 5 up and 4 downvotes.) It doesn't help with the claim that the sub seems to be full force against anything UKIP.

The point is you cannot base a party on the actions and views its Councillors and members have. UKIP has them coming out now, mainly by them saying something they should have kept to themselves. A new party with expansion as great as UKIP's will always struggle to sufficiently vet all Councillors, and it makes it harder with them not being career politicians and not knowing the proper way to behave in the public eye. I guarantee a crap load of Con/Lib/Lab members have opinions that would get them thrown out of the party.

1) It doesn't work as a general, long term deterrent for criminal behaviour. It works as a deterrent for specific areas for short periods of time such as 1- 2 months and as such is usually a waste of money:
 
http://www.popcenter.org/library/scp/pdf/74-Gill_et_al.pdf

https://dspace.stir.ac.uk/bitstream/1893/2703/1/interconnection%20between%20technological%20and%20policy%20innovation%2009.pdf

http://www.palgrave-journals.com/sj/journal/v15/n3/abs/8340118a.html

The specific phenomenon is called security theatre. In fact the guy who came up with that term has some good thoughts on CCTV https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/06/cctv_cameras.html 

2) That in the near future the technological capacity of CCTV camera's is going to change radically. Once facial recognition software improves to the point of compressing facial data on the fly it will be possible to transmit it to centralised storage and maintain databases of peoples public movements - whether or not we do that is not a foregone conclusion but there are certainly no laws that even start to address, let alone prevent that in place at the moment. (I'm going to assume that you know enough about tech to not demand sources for this being possible).

I can't even remember the last time I bought a phone but if you have the terms and conditions look for the warranty in there or on a separate document. That will let you know if you are covered or not or if there is a difference between software and hardware. If you are not covered by their particular warranty then I doubt you'll be able to get a refund. 

Your best bet if you think you are covered by the warranty is to just call up their customer service and deal with them directly. It might take a while but if your persistent and you have the warranty then they'll probably back down. They might have warranty information online. [This is the information on the S3](http://skp.samsungcsportal.com/integrated/popup/FaqDetailPopup3.jsp?cdsite=uk&amp;seq=430148) and in line with the EU directive the handset itself has a warranty of 2 years. If you show you aren't going to back down they will probably just do it. [This article seems to suggest that after 6 months the burden of proof rests on the consumer](http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/bills/article-1677034/Two-year-warranty-EU-law.html) to show that the damage was part of the actual product and not their fault.

true,ibpants,1972crest,,"It's fair enough, mate.  Reddit isn't going to be for everyone given that the up and downvotes *do* promote groupthink, and whether you think you care about karma or not, I think getting upvoted probably does make you feel like people are reading and digesting what you're saying whereas downvotes make you feel like people aren't paying attention or have missed the point.  Naturally you're going to steer more towards things that you think people are going to understand.

What's more, with [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/) you can see who you've upvoted and down voted previously so you see someone in the negatives and you're already prepared to assume the worst of what they have to say.

Anyway, those are some personal gripes with how reddit influences people.

You've been downvoted for some perfectly innocuous comments, which suggests that people probably are recognising you and giving you an extra downvote just because.

For what it's worth I think you've made some really solid points in your brief time here.  That whole thing about Joe Hart, for instance, should have been a good discussion and one that *is* worth having, but people seemed intent on burying it.  I didn't agree with everything you said, but you made good points.

Unfortunately a fair chunk of your contributions have been abrasive (I'm sure deliberately if you're being totally honest, right?) and it's having a knock on effect with your other comments.

I hope you stick around because you've got some interesting stuff to say, and I hope there are people that appreciate how they could benefit from what you bring to the sub, but I can see it doing bad things for both yours and their blood pressure, so I definitely understand if you don't spend too much time here.",0,1398800050,null,0,false,0,ch5alrk,t3_247v2c,t1_ch5alrk,t1_ch594ue,null,1433577209,2,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,2

Obviously, there is a clear difference in community votes - no Nationalists voting against, and only 4 unionists voting for (NI21, plus two members of the UUP). Interestingly, there is a striking difference in abstension - only two Unionist MLAs weren't present for the vote, but 10 Nationalists skipped it (split roughly evenly between the parties, from a quick glance). It should be noted that this was less than the simple majority by which the vote was defeated. While it doesn't make much difference in the grand scheme of things because of the Petition of Concern, it would be nice and symbolic if we could actually say a majority of MLAs support the bill. 

Also, the Alliance vote is interesting - of 8 MLAs, four voted for, two were absent, and two voted against. For a party whose official party stance is now clearly in favour of marriage equality, it will be interesting to see if there is any censure of the people who voted against party policy.

Currently cameras don't store film for that long because even a low res camera could fill your average hard drive in a few days. The difference with facial recognition is that you have the ability to store the key components of someones face which could trivially reduce the size of the data you need to store and allow movements to be stored for years with the same camera and hard drive - no expensive hardware upgrade necessarily required.

&gt; (2A)For the purposes of this Act, goods are of satisfactory quality if they meet the standard that a reasonable person would regard as satisfactory, taking account of any description of the goods, the price (if relevant) and all the other relevant circumstances.

&gt; (2B)For the purposes of this Act, the quality of goods includes their state and condition and the following (among others) are in appropriate cases aspects of the quality of goods—

&gt; (a)fitness for all the purposes for which goods of the kind in question are commonly supplied,

&gt; (b)appearance and finish,

&gt; (c)freedom from minor defects,

&gt; (d)safety, and

&gt; (e)durability. 

[Section 48A](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1979/54/section/48A) states that:

&gt; (1)This section applies if—

&gt; (a)the buyer deals as consumer or, in Scotland, there is a consumer contract in which the buyer is a consumer, and

&gt; (b)the goods do not conform to the contract of sale at the time of delivery.

&gt; (2)If this section applies, the buyer has the right—

&gt; (a)under and in accordance with section 48B below, **to require the seller to repair or replace the goods**

TL;DR: Because your bike isn't fit for purpose, safe or durable, you can demand that Halfords (not the manufacturer, as they may attempt to fob you off like that) replace or repair it.

Under the Sale of Goods Act you have the right to refund, replacement or repair for an item you brought is faulty  - it is your choice as to which you get and if you choose a refund then they cannot force you to take a credit note or store vouchers.  There is no time limit on this, simply an assessment of whether the item could reasonably be expected to have lasted that long.  So whilst asking for a refund on a bread roll after 10 months would be unreasonable, the man on the Clapham omnibus would expect a bike to last much longer than that.

The only possible get out clause for Halfords is if you've done a dodgy repair job or not looked after the bike properly.

true,the-ginger-one,irish,Ireland,"Taken from [Ilko over on XDA](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1998801)

&gt; Directive 1999/44/CE dictates1 that any object meeting certain criteria (incl. telephones, computers, routers etc.) that is sold to a consumer2. inside the European Union, has to carry a warranty from the seller that the device will meet the quality that you would expect for such a device for a period of 2 years.
&gt; 
&gt; A telephone is an example of such a device and is an object that comprises many parts, from the case to the screen to the radio, to a mini-computer, to the battery, to the software that runs it. If any of these parts3 stop working in those 2 years, the seller has to fix or replace them. What is more these repairs should not cost the consumer a single cent — the seller has to cover the expenses (Directive 1999/44/CE, §3). If the seller has any expenses for returning it to the manufacturer, this is not your problem as a consumer.
&gt; 
&gt; If your device becomes defective in the first 6 months, it is presumed that the defect was there all along, so you should not need to prove anything.
&gt; 
&gt; If your device becomes defective after the first 6 months, but before 2 years run out, you are still covered. The difference is only that if the defect arises now, the seller can claim that the defect was caused by some action that was triggered by non-normal use of the device4. But in order to avoid needing to repair or replace your device, the seller has to prove that your action caused5 the defect. It is generally recognised by courts that unless there is a sign of abuse of the device, the defect is there because the device was faulty from the beginning. That is just common sense, after all.
&gt; 
&gt; So, we finally come to the question of rooting, flashing and changing the software. Unless the seller can prove that modifying the software, rooting your device or flashing it with some other OS or firmware was the cause for the defect, you are still covered for defects during those 2 years. A good test to see if it is the software’s fault is to flash it back with stock firmware/OS and see if the problem persists. If it does, it is not a software-caused problem. If it is not possible to revert it stock software any more, it is also not a software-caused defect. There are very few hardware defects that are caused by software — e.g. overriding the speaker volume above the safe level could blow the speaker.
&gt; 
&gt; Many manufacturers of consumer devices write into their warranties a paragraph that by changing the software or “rooting” your device, you void the warranty. You have to understand that in EU we have a “statutory warranty”, which is compulsory that the seller must offer by law (Directive 1999/44/CE, §7.1) and a “voluntary warranty” which the seller or manufacturer can, but does not need to, offer as an additional service to the consumer. Usually the “voluntary warranty” covers a longer period of time or additional accidents not covered by law6. If though the seller, the manufacturer or anyone else offers a “voluntary warranty”, he is bound to it as well!
&gt; 
&gt; So, even if, by any chance your “voluntary warranty” got voided, by European law, you should still have the 2 year “compulsory warranty” as it is described in the Directive and which is the topic of this article.
&gt; 
&gt; In case the seller refuses your right to repair or replace the device, you can sue him in a civil litigation and can report the incident to the national authority. In many European countries such action does not even require hiring a lawyer and is most of the time ensured by consumers associations.
&gt; 
&gt; The warranty under this Directive is only applicable inside the European Union and only if you bought the device as a consumer.
&gt; 
&gt; [1] EU member states must have by now imported the Directive 1999/44/CE into their national laws. So you should quote also your local law on that topic.
&gt; 
&gt; [2] A consumer is a natural person who acts for their own private purposes and not as a professional. .
&gt; 
&gt; [3] Batteries can be exempt of this and usually hold only 6 months warranty.
&gt; 
&gt; [4] E.g. a defect power button could be caused by spreading marmalade in it or hooking it onto a robot that would continuously press the button every second 24/7 — of course that is not normal or intended use.
&gt; 
&gt; [5] Note that correlation is not causation — the defect has to be proven to be caused by your action, not just correlate with it.
&gt;

I like this law because it covers all manner of possible tyrannical extremists and I believe democracy is a cornerstone of our values system.

Id like to see something similar implemented here. I would like to extend it to any group that plans on undermining democracy anywhere in the world.  

Why do I want this, because it would kill islamism stone dead in this country. There is a consistent theme running through islamist groups and that is the creation of an islamic state ruled under sharia law. There are lots of different ways that different groups intend to achieve that. Some violent some peaceful. 

But having a law like that would undermine these islamist groups and if they wanted to create an islamic state ruled by sharia law they would have to enter the political circus and fight it out in the battle of ideas rather than impose the wants of a subset of extremists onto a majority. 

The law clearly doesn't breach EU legislation as its part of  German basic law.

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"You're an amusing guy. Internet debate specialist no doubt. 

Let me point out a few errors in your thinking. 

&gt;Well living here from the age of 8 is not really anything to do with it. 

Well , actually it does, he's said numerous times when questioned about his nationality that he's British and that's all that he's known. He felt that way before he took up running - which was quite late as he originally wanted to be a footballer.  Adnan Januszi and other sports people who qualify for other teams have taken a different approach and that is entirely up to them. 

Identity is a complex thing - if someone feels that they are a British citizen and wants to represent their country - why should anything stop them? 

&gt;... Queen isn't really as clever as you seem to think it is, given that that is about claims and ancestry.

Actually it's superbly clever because destroys claims to many things - firstly it takes apart the claim that there is such a thing as an ""ancient Britishness"" , because Britain as a socio-politcla structure was created in 1707 and the whole Britishness project was a form of identity creation deliberately created by Unionist in order to bed down the stability of the new political system especially in the aftermath of TWO Jacobite Rebellions. 

Secondly, it sniffs out the hypocrits and the bigots. You see racism and bigotry relies on cognitive responses or ""dog whistles"" as politicians might call them. These are reactions that are forced from people by passing rational thinking. 

That's why it work so well. It's a gorgeous litmus test. See, if the cognitive response to that example is that it verifies a model of Civic citizenship/nationalism or ""Britishness"" - a bit like American nationalism - then the Queen's family are a perfect example of that. 

But if the cognitive response is to then point out that "" the Queen and her father were born in the UK any way"" , then the person who responds isn't interested in the idea of Britishness being civic nationalism, it becomes about genes and essentialist claims. 

The response to that example tells me more about the responder than the example tells me about nationalism.

&gt;I'm pretty sure this exact same guy would have questioned the Britishness of a German born runner who had just won a medal, but then you wouldn't have cared because he wouldn't have been brown. Remind me, who is the racist?

There's three responses to this. Firstly, it's all supposition and ignoratio elenchi. You're assuming a) the UKIP person would have just as upset about a fictitious German born runner and b) that I wouldn't have cared if the guy wasn't brown. There's no evidence of either. 

Secondly, it assumes that my concept of citizenship is the same as yours, which is evidently not the case through the arguments I have presented. A British person is as British as they feel and the passport they wish to hold. I don't really care if they've been here or not - it's entirely their choice. 

This is called logical consistency.

Thirdly, if you're truly British then my position is the only one that can really be acceptable. We live in a country that was created in 1707 by an act of parliament, with multiple identities and cultures such as Scots, Welsh and even Cornish. 

Identity is complex and changes, it is the result of many social interactions that form someone's view of the world. Why argue that one person's identity is less just because they are born somewhere different from you? 

What I cannot stand , however, is the application of discrimination based on race, colour, gender or disability. Regardless of your nationality , citizenship or birth.

1. According to you black = poor. Well done, although I can already hear the screech and backtracking equivocation before you hit enter...save it. The frankly ridiculous notion that acting and presenting is the preserve of the middle classes and that the lack of ethnic minorities is clearly due to them all being poor is so insulting and fucking stupid I don't really know where to start. Never mind Chiwetel Ejiofor is the son of a Doctor and Pharmacist, he clearly had to go to the Us to find his fortune due to his incompetent parents being the most ineffectual graduates and healthcare professionals in Britain. Lets ignore that David Harewood trained at RADA, whose notable alumni include chavs like Richard Attenborough, Ralph Fiennes, Sir Anthony Hopkins, Joan Collins and council estate politician Glenda Jackson. Glenda Jackson is an interesting case. Father was a builder, mother a cleaner. Sounds quite working class to me, yet she managed, despite her obvious ailment, to cast off that crushing and debilitating weight to be an award winning actress and noted politician. Fancy that!

2. How do I know it's racism? I don't know, maybe because the numbers make no sense even when you account for class disparity and looks like an even sillier excuse when these so called poor urchins of the ghetto manage to scrape enough benefits together to emigrate to the US where suddenly their poor diction and possible illiteracy don't seem to be a factor anymore...why they even thrive, outdoing their African American counterparts while playing African Americans! It's almost as if they were accomplished actors after all yet for some reason that was *totally* nothing to do with this countries latent biases (see all the comments that claim, *despite* the actual numbers, ethnic minorities are actually *overrepresented* and then tell me such sentiment doesn't reveal bias) and everything to do with them not being middle class enough, like Danny Dyer, Ray Winstone and the blokes that played the Mitchell brothers.

3. Ah, the ""woah is me!"" argument, I love these! So, for years the bottom of the totem pole in terms of the UK education system were firmly afro/caribbean boys. We lagged behind *every* ethnic group going, only joined briefly by Bangladeshi lads. At that point it was ""what's wrong with the black community?"" it was ""why are black people so anti intellect and education?"" it was ""What about the fathers? It's all the absent fathers"" and other shit that firmly placed the blame on us. It was our problem and throwing money at it was a waste. Fast forward to now and there's a shift as the black middle class is boosted by the growing African middle class moving here and their stressing of academia. It certainly brings up the average, but that leave the worst performing section open to white working class boys...and it's *everyone else's fault*! No questions about why don't white people like education. No witch hunt about the dysfunction of the white family unit. No scapegoating of ""white culture"" and a forensic examination of white music, media and values. No, it's the sort of impotent moaning you're doing now and derailment of any discussion that doesn't include you because, damn it's hard being you.

Barclays will next week announce the creation of a bad bank in a bid to transform its struggling investment banking operations, which were dealt a further blow on Tuesday with the departure of the highly regarded head of its US business.

The move to exit parts of its shrinking fixed income business and its lossmaking European branch network will be announced as part of next week’s strategic update to investors, according to people familiar with the plan. The internal bad bank will be run by Eric Bommensath, the co-head of its investment bank.

The news comes as fears intensify that the departure of Skip McGee as head of Barclays Americas will trigger an exodus of bankers acquired when the UK bank took over Lehman Brothers’ US operations during the financial crisis.

Analysts and rival bankers said his departure was a blow for Antony Jenkins, chief executive, who defended last year’s higher bonus pool in spite of falling profits as necessary to avoid a “death spiral” of bankers quitting to seek a bigger pay cheque.

The bank said Mr McGee’s departure was a result of the vast regulatory burden it faces in the US. The Texas-born dealmaker was part of the Lehman team that negotiated the sale of its US operations to Barclays in 2008 and he has been seen as pivotal in holding together the business.

Mr McGee, 54, is being replaced as head of Barclays Americas on Thursday by Joe Gold, its global head of client capital management, who the UK bank hired out of the ashes of the failed Enron energy trading empire 12 years ago.

Barclays has been under pressure from investors to cut costs and rein in pay levels while coming up with a more coherent strategy for its investment bank, which is failing to generate returns above its cost of capital.

The new non-core unit is likely to house parts of Barclays’ macro products unit, which includes the trading of interest rate-linked products, currencies and commodities. The unit suffered a 23 per cent drop in revenues last year and is facing growing pressure from new regulation that forces the bank to hold more capital against it.

It is expected to include some or all of Barclays’ retail banking businesses in France, Italy, Spain and Portugal, which it has been attempting to sell for several years. Losses from its 572 branches in continental Europe widened from £277m to £964m last year.

The bank is also expected to add the £54.4bn of assets left in businesses already identified as non-core, including leveraged loans and European corporate loans.

Mr McGee said: “My focus has always been on clients, but given the need for Barclays’ leadership to focus on regulatory issues for the foreseeable future, I have decided that it is time for me to move on to new challenges.”

Ian Gordon, analyst at Investec, said: “This is likely to be at best a precursor to musical chairs at Barclays and at worst the start of more bloodletting of senior executives in the bank.”

At its heated annual meeting last week, more than a third of investors refused to back Barclays’ remuneration report, reflecting widespread anger over its decision to increase bonuses in a year when the bank’s profits fell by more than a third.

Mr McGee, who is understood to be considering several options of what to do next, received 3.81m shares worth almost £8.9m this year from deferred bonus schemes – the highest amount received of all the senior executives at the bank.

&gt; So, the [Hansard](http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/Assembly-Business/Official-Report/Reports-13-14/29-April-2014/) report is out on the vote. The full text is much too tiring, but the breakdown of the vote is interesting.

&gt; Obviously, there is a clear difference in community votes - no Nationalists voting against, and only 4 unionists voting for (NI21, plus two members of the UUP). Interestingly, there is a striking difference in abstension - only two Unionist MLAs weren't present for the vote, but 10 Nationalists skipped it (split roughly evenly between the parties, from a quick glance). It should be noted that this was less than the simple majority by which the vote was defeated. While it doesn't make much difference in the grand scheme of things because of the Petition of Concern, it would be nice and symbolic if we could actually say a majority of MLAs support the bill. While the party support is clearly there, the membership might not quite all be on board yet.

&gt; Also, the Alliance vote is interesting - of 8 MLAs, four voted for, two were absent, and two voted against. For a party whose official party stance is now clearly in favour of marriage equality, it will be interesting to see if there is any censure of the people who voted against party policy.

Kinda the point I was making about the difference in culture in this subreddit, I don't have anything in common with most of the posters in this subreddit. I'm in the minority, and in a topic which is so culture centric, it defeats the whole object of it. IMO at least.

Maybe I should create a sub subreddit?

Thanks re the Joe Hart comments. Just like to point out that those are sincere too, all of my posts are.

Although, as you've noticed it isn't my style to be diplomatic, and I can be abrasive, especially on a contentious topic. Sometimes deliberately so, I do admit. But given some of the responses I've had I think it's all be give and take to be honest.

That said, I just tell things as I see them, I don't see the purpose in sugar coating anything. Although I recognise that doesn't always do me any favours.

Wouldn't ever let anything I've read on here raise my blood pressure, in fact, quite the opposite, this is the internet after all. People seem to adopt an exaggerated version of themselves. Myself included. You just have to roll with the punches and laugh it off.

Where ever you are staying there is almost certainly a bus link into the town center, and 2 minutes walk from the town center bus station, there is an asda (very large, all purpose super market)

Bus tickets from the Hospital to Cov are likely to be £2-3 (estimate), if you need to travel back late at night expect a taxi to cost anywhere upto £30.

true,SirMuttley,cnty-uk,British in Bangkok,"&gt; According to the Office for National Statistics’ British Crime Survey of 2008, 22 percent of people in Britain will be the victim of some crime during the course of a single year.

So the crime and justice section starts with statistics from 6 years ago, good one.

&gt; Ending the £4.5 billion a year wars in Iraq and Afghanistan;

Ummm, British troops left Iraq in 2009 and will leave Afghanistan this year.

&gt; The restoration of discipline – including corporal punishment

Oh yes, we should all be beating our kids when they're bad.

&gt; The reintroduction of competitive sports and **daily Christian assemblies**

What century do they live in?

&gt; Support the overwhelming majority of the British people in their desire to keep the Pound and our **traditional weights and measures**

Really? Love to see some statistics to say that the overwhelming majority of British people really give a shit about our traditional weights and measures. Will we take our currency back to pre-decimalisation too?

&gt; Replace 100,000 NHS bureaucrats with doctors, nurses and dentists;

Are they just plucking large numbers out of thin air or do they know which 100,000 people they want to make unemployed? And where will we get 100,000 doctors, nurses and dentists from.... oh yeah not from abroad.

&gt; End the scandal of foreign health tourism

The scandal that really doesn't cost the NHS that much

&gt; Finally, more emphasis must be placed on healthy living with greater understanding of sickness prevention through physical exercise, a healthier environment and improved diets.

Nick Griffin is really leading by example on this one.

&gt; Deport all those who commit crimes and whose original nationality was not British

Oh, so my wife came here when she was 4 years old. She's now 37. They'd deport her if she committed a crime?

&gt; Review all recent grants of residence or citizenship to ensure they are still appropriate

So basically remove citizenship from British citizens.

&gt; Reject all asylum seekers who passed safe countries on their way to Britain

Yes, because so many asylum seekers arrive by air... oh I see that's the idea.

true,Melberger,null,null,"His improvement has been vast.

He was my man of the match at Anfield. Had Suarez in his pocket all game.

He's a front foot defender, much like Vinnie, he steps out and tries to intercept the ball. He harangues the player in possession when they receive the ball to feet, snapping at their ankles and forcing them into a negative pass backwards, or putting in a good challenge, winning the ball and carrying into the opposition's half and then picking a good pass.

Attacks corners very well too, he's usually the one we look to aim for, for a near post flick on. And it's got us a few goals this season.

He has some very obvious weaknesses though, if he gets too tight and turned, then he's gone, out of it. No pace whatsoever. But, he's an intelligent and experience defender, so that doesn't happen often, especially since he's settled.

Can go to ground a bit too often, but he's doing that less now as well.

His biggest strength is his comfort in possession, and his calm head. Too calm sometimes though, he can give the ball away occasionally in dangerous areas when we're high up the pitch with a complacent pass.

But he seems to be doing this less often now also.

Holds a strong line as well, really helps with the organisation of the back four, I suppose that would always come with time once himself and Vinnie worked on their partnership and understanding.

He's really settling in now, he didn't deserve to be scapegoated the way he has previously IMO, just the mentality of some of always needing someone to blame. Plus the media were a joke, a big part of it.

Overall, an important member of the squad at present.

That said, we do need an upgrade, a real world class talent with youth on his side to partner Kompany longterm. Since that doesn't look like being Nastasic anymore, with his injury struggles and difficulty to adapt to the highline approach, that player looks like being Mangala via Porto.

He's a quality young talent, with all the physical attributes, looks a bit raw, but has a very real talent and potential to improve further.

I'd be delighted if we get hold of him.

Most young lads are going to go to England as you get the exposure. I've moved out to Australia since and have been comparing their league with ours and even out here though the current league format is new they're already light years ahead of our domestic league. 

I read a really interesting article about where they saw the future going and I thought it could apply to the LOI too. Rather than try and sign Marquee players who are on or past their sell by date. Set agreements with Premiership clubs and attract the young players on loan just before they are top talents targeting young Irish guys in particular. 

Strengthen the league with young talent rather than old. Tricky to implement for sure but the rationale was that if every club was loaning out a few players each from the premiership the standard of the league goes up as does the level of competitiveness. Some might end up staying if they liked it. And all we need is one team to qualify for Europe and the interest level peaks. 

The LOI would be seen as an actual viable option. Not saying it would work but I did think it was interesting and would bring something back to our league rather than waving good bye to our young talents. It is a bit of a cap in hand approach but it could really help seeing young talent who go on to become big rather than some has been. A look at our reserves and there's easily a few guys who'd have benefited from the loan and lit up the League of Ireland.

true,Petrichor94,null,null,"You become one with the city in some weird philosophical sense. I'm a Londoner studying in Manchester and there is always something subtley different about the students up here than the students down South in London. A lot of my friends study at UCL, and they always comment on how much I've changed everytime we meet up.

Its miserable in Manchester, the weather sucks, its cold for most of the year, and the city is a hell of a lot smaller than London- and interestingly enough, thats why you should come here. There's something to be said about being able to fight the elements and be driven enough to become someone great. Its easy to do this in London, and many of my friends are very lazy because of it. London gets all the attention, so I feel there are some who have a point to prove- sort of like being the underdog.

I personally wouldn't come to Manchester if I wanted the easy way out. You can study in Imperial if you want - where you will be nice and cosy, probably live at home with your parents and get a hot dinner every night. You will be surrounded with International students with a strong language barrier and your nights out will be bloody expensive.

I remember when I was looking to go into University and I thought that because one uni required lesser grades than another, it would be an easier course. University is no longer a walk in the park. My family tells me about how it was a party and I'm wondering where the fuck my invitation went. You're doing a STEM degree, it's gonna get batshit hard wherever you go.

Pick the city, not just the course. A professor from Warwick University told me this when i was looking at Unis. I may not have listened to him at the time, but he's right, and I'm lucky to be here. I'm much happier for doing so.

Note: I spent two years studying in London in a college opposite Imperial's main campus. There's of course lots to see in Kensington, but as with any location, its not where you are that matters, its who you're with.

What a clueless dipshit you are, proving my point that simply saying ""Oh, oops I didn't know that"" would be beyond you.

Lets address your cluelessness.

Whos is Ed Vaizey? He's the UK Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries. What does that mean? Well it means he's in charge of the Department for **Culture**, **Media** and Sport. Did you see those bold bits? You did? Good.

So, what does this department do? Here's the blurb from their site:

&gt;The Department for Culture, Media &amp; Sport (DCMS) is here to help make Britain the world’s most creative and exciting place to live, visit and do business. We protect and promote our cultural and artistic heritage and help businesses and communities to grow by investing in innovation and highlighting Britain as a fantastic place to visit. Alongside this, we protect our deeply held beliefs in freedom and equality. We help to give the UK a unique advantage in the global race for economic success.

So, what egregious demand is it being made by Lenny Henry? Well the man himself addresses your foolishness here when asked about the dreaded ""positive discrimination"". [Listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw64cy8qEcA#t=132).

So in summation various ""regions"" already get funded by Ed Vaizey's department, clearly in an effort for the distinct cultures and local voices to be preserved, heard and represented in the media. Apparently this evil has been going on right under our noses the whole time! And Lenny Henry, the rouge, has asked to be included in said duplicitous knavery...the cad!

You're a sad little person who has built a prison of your own ignorance, hatred and fear. Your first reaction is always seemingly ""how will this hurt me?! How can I most loudly protest?!?"" rather than taking a step back and using your head for once.

For example in my field, 3d animation, there are loads of technologies. Everyone has little quarter finished projects that they picked up, dabbled and then put down. 

They are no use to anyone and those aren't real skills. 

What is much more useful is someone who can pick a small project and complete it. 

Some small, discrete package that shows a technique from beginning to end. 

Can you open a 3d package and mess around with particles? Useless. 

Can you set yourself a brief and use those skills to completion, completing all the tasks as you go along? 

Great. You'll fit right in over here. ",0,1398812572,null,0,false,0,ch5gv9s,t3_24af3f,t1_ch5gv9s,t1_ch5fv2m,null,1433580226,1,false,UKJobs,t5_2seb3,1

But a lot of the groups that believed those things just kept their heads down. Re-organised, got new members, re-thought their ideology and came back.  They exist across the political spectrum. 

A lot of the right has always resented the progress we've made. Always. We've had to grab it from them inch by bloody inch. People forget that clause 28 was a mainstream Tory policy. Or that some very senior Labour and Tory politicians were vehemently against the race relations act and other monumental pieces of legislation.  People forget what an earthquake the Stephen Lawrence enquiry a the time. 

These forces will always be there and they will always need fighting. It's a shame that the people who should be doing it have caved in or ignored the problem.

We needed agile players like Hendo popping up instead of Lucas' slow movement. Given those ideas, we should have been patient. Waited. Not forcing it and probing to see where they might lapse concentration. At the end of the day we would of had a draw if we didn't find a goal.

But Gerrard's slip was unfortunate to say the least. Shit like that happens and you cannot plan or prepare for it. I think that made a lot of difference and Mourinho lucked out there. They did not look like scoring at all. At the end of the day, like Brendan said, it's good experience for palace and I'm sure he made few notes for the future as well.

Lennon is the man in charge and he makes all the decisions as far as I can see.  Johan's area of expertise is clearly the defense and he's helped significantly in that area, especially right when Lennon took over and we were a shambles.  
I think he was instrumental in bringing some players in, Majstrorovic who didn't really work out and Lustig who's been an outstanding player for us.  We're really going to miss that element from him.  
Johan clearly has the respect of Sweedish players and I can see him having no trouble attracting Swedes to play for AIK
He can be vocal on the sidelines at times but I think he's more of pre match type guy.  I can't imagine standing up to him, he's a bloody mountain of a man, so I'm sure there's not much arguing when he's around.  Based on Lennons tweets, when he used to tweet that is, Johan does not like losing at anything, cards, golf, anything you care to mention.
I'll likely keep an eye on AIK's results from now on, as Johan was such a great servant for us, as a player and as a coach.  Best of luck to you guys.

true,ZFree2013,null,null,"Yeah I see where you are coming from. 

One of the main things I would point out if I was to single the Chelsea game in particular though, is that there were eleven men behind the ball, so there were few possibilities to really take on a few players and get goal side. 

I think probably also in general, Defenders are wise to him now, and unless he is playing off another out and out striker I guess he is heavily marked for 90 mins, like we saw with the Sterling goal at Norwich, the defenders peeled away to mark him because they see him as the biggest threat.

Also, It is probably more than likely just as you said, we have been treated to an inform Suarez, so at the moment he is not banging in goals or dribbling past players so we are a bit spoiled by his good form.

However, If we were to go back to that Chelsea game again, I do wish he could have created some magic, I think the problem with that game was he lost a lot of support because players started falling apart. He does have a lot of pressure on his shoulders, but then if he has that skill, It is easy to see why fans think he should be able to pull it out in the big games. 

So to sum it up, I think he finds it difficult playing for that extra space without Sturridge to pull away and drag defenders out of position, but mostly it is probably just one of those things and we are spoiled by his amazing season.

true,chimpwithalimp,lfc68,,"I think it's a bit like a seesaw. If he's scoring and providing goals he is a pleasure to watch, even for neutrals. However if he isn't doing that, the ugly side of his game comes back... the diving, feigning injury, sarcastic clapping at opponents and officials and anger at his team mates. 

I've been watching him very closely for the last three of four games to see if I can justify this opinion. For most of the season, if he received the ball 25 yards out, he would turn and do some magic to either run through a player (nutmegs!) or else he would do a snappy 1-2 with a team mate and play around them. The last few games, most of the time, he first-time passes the ball immediately back to midfield when he receives it.

It could just be the hangover from a long exhausting season, or it could be a slight dent in his confidence stopping him run at players. Versus Chelsea, they shut him out completely but the once or twice he tried his magic, it seemed to work, like when he ran to the goal line and cut back, taking the defender out of it completely.

It's a pity because he has come off the boil at a critical end of season period, but then again you could argue that we're only in this position because he has been consistently ruthless all season.",0,1398814883,null,0,false,0,ch5hye4,t3_24bki9,t1_ch5hye4,t1_ch5hrkg,null,1433580739,16,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,16

Champions League is going to be great, but ultimately we'll probably be rank outsiders to win it and I think if we get through the group stage we can probably be happy enough with that.

I think on the other hand the Premier League is going to be tough. Chelsea and City will be strong, Arsenal and Everton could both be difficult, especially if they sign a few key players, and Utd are most likely going to do their best to splash out and get back up there. 

Looking negatively (as in we don't win anything), if we focus on the league, go out of the CL group stage and finish 2nd, then I'd say that's a pretty successful season. On the other hand if we focus on the CL, get to the semi-finals and get knocked out and then finish 6th in the league, it's a pretty disastrous result overall. Man Utd did OK in the Champions League this season and I don't think any of their fans would call their season anything other than a complete disaster.

We're not going to go from a squad that can challenge for the title in a 45 game season to one that can challenge for everything in a potentially 65 game season over one summer. We have to be patient and I think that means focusing on finishing in the top three or four in the league over the next two or three seasons.

@OP: In the US, depending on where one lives, there's only really a ""choice"" of one or two ISPs if you want broadband. We're also far less geographically separated and have different distribution of people and infrastructure. 

Visualise how big mainland Britain is, and compare it to a US state. To look at the UK as a whole, we have an area of 243,610 km² holding 63 million people. California alone has an area of 423,970 km² holding 38 million.

Over here, if you can get BT copper onto your premises, you can, to a large extent, take your pick. While the majority operate over BT Openreach copper, peering is largely done by the ISP. All it would take is ""Properly unlimited and we don't slow you down your Netflix"" and everyone would have to follow. We have a LOT of competition and it's fierce. 

BT (Retail), Sky, EE, Talktalk, at the top, and PlusNet (also part of BT), Zen, Demon etc. There's less competition than there was, where Sky have bought up O2's subscribers and rolled in Be, and Talktalk have eaten AOL, Tiscali and Pipex, but it's still better than the Yanks have it.
