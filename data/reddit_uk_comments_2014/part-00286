false,Callduron,null,null,"&gt; I don't think its that simple, 21 year olds generally have very different needs to 40 year olds. I'm 23 and I was in a low paying job for the last year so I moved back in with my parents because I couldn't afford to live by myself. If I was 40 with a wife and 2 kids that isn't really an option.

Except there are 40 year olds forced by poverty to move back in with their parents. Just as there are 21 year olds who can't.

In the long term it's really really bad that ordinary people can't afford housing because we also increasingly are building a system where ordinary people have to live with their parents. Who were last generation's ordinary young workers. 

What happens when those young people themselves become parents? Does everyone move in with grandma? What happens if grandma bequeaths the house to the Cats Home? Is everyone out on the street? Even if she leaves it to the next generation every generation will see a chunk taken off their property value due to inheritance tax and care home fees. 

Another consequence is that indigenous people will breed less. If you're 28 and you are saving every penny to get a deposit together you don't have the luxury of affording a child. Kids are expensive, especially if you want them to have nice things, as most prospective parents would. 25-35s will have to pick one of A. House or B. Family instead of expecting both. Many will pick A. because the prospect of renting forever is horrible as is the prospect of trying to bring up children when you haven't even grown up enough to leave home. Which will mean we need immigrants to do the jobs, we face having an aging population etc etc, just fuel for Ukip.

I'm pretty sure that Eleven, as of *Day of the Doctor*, knew that he didn't do the very things he had insanely regretted up until then. I'm not saying that he doesn't carry any regret for other, similar situations, but that one was supposedly expunged post-*Day*.

&gt; Pink's comparison to the Doctor being every other officer or soldier, when he has the fate of entire species in his hands. It makes me hate Pink, because Pink and 12 are in similar situations with regards to past war activity so Pink should be able to empathise with him, but he just acts like a huge dick to 12. And 12 just stands there and takes it from him because he doesn't want to hurt Clara :(

They aren't the same, and Danny makes that pretty clear. As an officer, as Danny puts it, the Doctor is the one who puts grunts' lives on the line. We know Danny's point has merit more than he does: This Doctor has much less of an issue with people dying around him (*Into the Dalek*), and his previous incarnations have led armies into battle (*A Good Man Goes to War*) and turned their companions into weapons (As the Daleks insinuate regarding the Children of Time in *Journey's End*). 

Danny was a grunt during his service - he served under officers who didn't mind putting their men's lives in danger, so that colors his opinion of the Doctor.

We've spent literally decades propagandising the idea that people who need help are lazy, or stupid, or scroungers, or scum.  Essentially that they **deserve** to be poor and that they don't **deserve** any help.

That aside the Conservative position going back to the sixties has been that helping the poor is the preserve of charities and the friendly societies.  The Big Society is just a rebranding of that.

Underneath the rhetoric, it's just a cut.  You could cut the money spent on benefits - predominantly on the old, but they vote.

&gt;When the ECHR was first ratified the governing body of it (the judges) didn't manage it[to] infer half of the handing downs it has now, including prisoners getting votes.

If you had read my second paragraph, I also gave my view on why the court wasn't, unlike /u/G_Morgan claimed, doing 'exactly what it was intended for' because it was ill-equipped to deal with 21st century Human Rights issues:

&gt; The simple matter is that the HRA is ill equipped to protect rights in the 21st century. The document the HRA was based off was written shortly after WWII. That is a very long time ago and a lot of the issues that exist today would not have been issues at the time.

In your second paragraph you gave an extremely specific example which was not given by /u/G_Morgan. If I was to know that his post was aimed specifically at such an example the nature of my response would have been different. Unfortunately for you, he did not specify as you did making this point utterly redundant to the matter at hand. 

Now as it happens, you have given a very good example of politicians obeying the ECHR with the Abu Qatada case. He was not deported until Jordan gave the UK a water-tight arrangement in which evidence gained from torture would not be used against him on trial (which was the original objection of the ECHR). After achieving this the UK deported him. To make the poor use of this example even richer, Abu Qatada was actually cleared of charges at the end of the trial in Jordan! 

&gt;You really need to proof read.

Your objection is fairly mute. I mean I could also try and one-up myself at every opportunity by trying to point out every error I see in a post. But I don't. Instead I chose to spend the time making the best points I can whilst I laugh at the utter shambles of responses I receive.

We tend to look for one, probably because the religions we're most used to have a central authority that dictates what does and doesn't pertain to that specific brand of christianity (obviously Catholics have the Pope and Anglicans have the Queen).

Islam has no such power structure and every Imam's interpretation of the religion is on equal footing.  On the one hand, it's a very democratic system.  On the other, if the people want something a bit nuts, they can find it and follow it.

So, yeah, most muslims would likely say that IS are not proper muslims and will have sensible theological ground for the claim.  The worrying thing is thousands are happy to follow the IS brand of islam and will claim that the moderates are not following a true form of the religion.

Ultimately, muslims themselves will ""vote"" on what is viable islamic teaching by following who they want to follow.

Of course it's unfortunate that minorities tend to get pained with stereotypes.  As you said, it's silly, but you can see why it happens - all you hear about it islam is regarding extremism.  There needs to be a strong, very public rejection of these extremist forms of islam and it can only be done by moderate muslims, ideally any in the public eye.

What's worse is that Rushanara Ali resigning in order to abstain is a lost opportunity for that sensible majority to be heard.

I'm going to bet that it's just as thought out as the bedroom tax was, i.e. not very. No provisions for the disabled who need the storage, no provisions for divorced fathers who look after their kids on weekends, no provisions for people stuck because there are no smaller properties available in the area to actually downsize to etc. Basically it was a cost cutting exercise with no regard for individual circumstances (A concern which was raised well before it was passed), and IMO this will be the same.

There is a case to be made for housing benefit as some people move out simply because it's available to them, not because they need it. But where do they draw the line?

false,willed1234,null,null,"Current UK medical student here. I don't know an awful lot about how things work in your country, but I'll do my best to answer any questions you have. 


Medicine is an undergraduate degree over here, so people typically go into straight from school at the age of 18. The standard course is 5 years long, but some more prestigious universities (Oxford, Cambridge etc) have 6 year courses. Some universities also allow you to take an extra year to get a bsc as well. Now having said all this, there are quite a few universities which allow graduates to do an accelerated 4 year course which I guess you'd be eligible for but you'd be one of the older people in your class. 


In terms of what you learn, the impression I get is that US medical school is a much more full on experience, and much more is expected of newly graduating doctors  than what is expected of ones from over here. I think this would mean that if you trained over here, you would find it tough to then get a job in America on graduation. I'm not saying doctors from this country are less competent, just that the training takes place at a different pace. 


On to where is good. Most big newspapers (Guardian, Independent, Times, Telegraph etc) publish university rankings by courses each year. [Here are the Guardian's latest rankings]( http://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2014/jun/03/university-guide-2015-league-table-for-medicine). These should always be taken with a pinch of salt however. For example, my medical school is ranked relatively poorly, however it's graduates are pretty well regarded amongst senior doctors. 


Feel free to ask any other questions you may have.

&gt;What's your wardrobe like?  

White trenchcoat, white homburg hat.  Dress shirts in blue tones, black pants and some solid kick-arse Doc Marten boots.

&gt;What about your TARDIS?  

A combination of McGann and Tennant - Steampunk aesthetic, flowing organic.  Maybe the round things (roundels??) are each an aquarium holding an exotic/alien fish or other marine animal.

Little facial tics and twitches (physical tourettes symptoms), borderline obsessive need to tap on things three times, habit of sniffing people.  Only one of these is actually true for the RealMe. ;)

No.  No catchphrases.  I have Views on those. :P

Johnson - Only senior RB in squad, Flanagan last season had the most players get past him. 

Gerrard - He has done bad in like 2 games, last season he was good enough to ignore defensive shortcomings (as we had the players to make the most out of it).

Skrtel - Skrtel is 29 and despite what people say should not be dropped on the basis of forming a Sahko/Lovren partnership as it is for ""the future"". He has defensive lapses occasionally but last season he made up for it via offensive qualities.

Lovren - Rodgers must of seen something he liked about him at Southampton, even though I'm not convinced he should be a guaranteed starter. ",0,1411864626,null,0,1411865234,0,ckuc4oo,t3_2hnawd,t1_ckuc4oo,t3_2hnawd,null,1426791261,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

I honestly don't know what some people are looking at if they think Sakho has played well this season.

Off the top of my head,

[He gave away the corner that Villa scored off by not clearing the ball.
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfnNTm7QhlU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m1s)

[He failed to control an aerial ball straight to a Ludogorets player, then got nutmegged which lead to a shot hitting the post. (2:00)](http://www.lfc.vn/media/highlights/highlights-liverpool-ludogorets-sky-sports-cl15-m01/)

[He made an awful sliding challenge inside the box against Ludogorets that let the attacker cut back inside and lead to Moreno's game saving tackle.](https://vine.co/v/OW7neOwLdxd)

[He gave the ball away with an awful pass vs Middlesbrough, then handled it on the edge of the area, leading to their first goal.  Then he got nutmegged again on the through ball that lead to Boro's 2nd goal.](http://www.lfc.vn/media/goals-liverpool-boro-lc15-r3/)

When he's got time and space he's fine, when the shits hitting the fan he's been like a deer in the the headlights.  I don't think he's ""not good enough"" for us or that this is the best he has to offer, but anyone who is saying he's played well so far are kidding themselves.  He's making high profile errors and they're costing us.  ",0,1411864678,null,0,false,0,ckuc5et,t3_2hnawd,t1_ckuc5et,t1_cku8o6w,null,1426791250,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

I don't understand what benefit this is going to produce compared to the staggering increase in financial difficulty it will cause among some young people in certain parts of the country where jobs just don't exist.

It seems to me that young people are the last people that should ever be banned from JSA. Youth unemployment is higher than among older adults. Older adults have had several years to accumulate skills, work experience and training to find a job of some sort. Young people just out of school or university are not going to have the experience or the training. They are expensive to employ compared to someone who is already trained. Young people are the one's least likely to be employed in a downturn (hence our high youth unemployment) and thus more likely to genuinely require JSA. Remove JSA for the over 40s instead, why do young people have to pay? 

Also isn't he supposed to be making houses cheaper for first time buyers, i.e young people? So why is he making it impossible for those same people to make use of housing benefit to cover the costs of rent which, precisely because house prices have risen, is becoming unaffordable for young people? So fuck over renters on housing benefits and encourage the same people to BUY AN ENTIRE FUCKING HOUSE by offering it at 20% under market value? WHAT?

Also it was pretty clear that the public didn't like Gordon Brown and keeping him in power would have been hugely unpopular. Forcing Labour to have a leadership election would also have been very unpopular/unworkable due to the time it would take and then the public having not actually voted for that leader. 

The only real options were coalition with the Conservatives (what we got), letting them form a minority government with an agreement to provide support for some concessions (not the best outcome for the country as we needed a strong government to deal with the financial problems) or to have another general election (where the Lib Dems would have been wiped out as people would want to make sure we get a government this time, so they would be more likely to vote for the 2 big parties). 

The outcome from the election was pretty much the worst thing that could have happened to the Lib Dems. I actually think that if the Conservatives had managed to get a majority, they may have had major gains during this parliament. They would have been able to be in opposition, and with the shambles that Labour have been they would have been able to steal some of that support. Then probably after the next election (2015) a Labour/Lib Dem coalition would have been possible and they may have been able to continue growing from that. As it stands now they probably won't be a significant part of the political system for much longer. Can definitely see them splintering if they have a really bad election next year.

In fact, to the best of my knowledge, working immigrants are good for the economy. Around 30% of immigrants return home rather than stay here and claim a pension when they get old.*

(*I honestly don't know where I remember this figure from, because I'm slightly drunk right now, but I remember reading several articles a few years ago about the net immigration statistics where around 70% of immigrants who came here in the past 50 years claimed a state pension. If someone has some better figures please feel free to correct me.)

They are (generalisation) an economic gain, in that they pay their taxes and take less than they give over the years because they leave before they become a drain on the tax system.

And make no mistake, pensions are the largest drain on the welfare budget by well over 5 times the amount of JSA. At the end of 2012 there were 2.5million people claiming JSA, and 11.6million people claiming a state pension. Along with another 11.6million people claiming DLA.

There aren't many exact figures for how many of each group claim the full amount, but as a quick introduction, pensioners and DLA get more than JSA as standard.

If you want a rough idea;

http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jan/08/uk-benefit-welfare-spending#zoomed-picture

What that graphic doesn't take into account is that a large amount of people claiming housing benefit are actually in work. Even I qualify for housing benefit, albeit around Â£20 a month depending on my shift pattern. The most common form of benefit seems to be housing and council tax benefit, even for working people.

I started off trying to make a point and I kind of got lost somewhere.

I think I'm ranting about how immigrants are actually helping this country and I'm pretty sure I'm preaching to the choir.

What? You point to one person who puts Guidetti in a god-like pedestal. Fans just wanted him to come in and do well after his stint at Feyenoord went phenomenal. Then he was out the entire season when he did come back. We then saw the video of Pellegrini's first days at City and he specifically goes up to Guidetti and says he wanted him at Malaga so we all thought this would mean Guidetti would be given a chance. Of course it's not all that simple cause we don't know the extent of his injury and how much it changed him. 

I hope we can all agree that Guidetti succeeding at City would lead to more youth coming through the team instead of just buying replacements every season. All hope lies on Lopes and Rekik for now.

There are three weaknesses in the part of the article I quoted.  One is that half the incidents occurred online. The second is that 33 or 34 incidents are unsubstantiated.  The third ties back to the first in that an unspecified number are online comments which didn't relate to the UK.

I think that the third part is highly pertinent when you claim to be monitoring anti-Muslim attacks **in Britain**.  Aside from anything else if that's not outside the parameters then an American suggesting the Middle East should be nuked counts equally.  *(Something I have heard and which employed with disturbing glee the phrase, ""Turn the desert to glass"".)*   By the same token every backwards utterance of ISIS supporters counts as a Muslim attack on the West.

I think that's plainly ridiculous.

In fact as I was typing the bottom half of this the chat in a game has just delivered me the lines, ""were [America] full although islam is going to be empty soon. were gonna turn it into a nice shiney giant ashtray"" and, ""the middle east should be used as a nuke test site""  *(Both comments within a couple of minutes of one another.  Two different people or at least two different characters.)*

Onto the specifics of online spite and bigotry...

&gt; I mean, go look at Britain First members postings on their Facebook (and BF ""like"" a lot of their comments)
&gt; Calling for murder, torture, terrorist acts against Muslims.
&gt; Now don't get me wrong, most of those are ""keyboard warriors"" but shouldn't they be treated the same anyway?

I think treating them as the same would be a ridiculous case of false equivalence.

The crimes of assault and battery *(although they're often charged together)* are separate and different for good reason.

While all following are unacceptable each of the following they're fundamentally different:    
*Idiot in a video game says, ""Islam will be turned into a shiney giant ashtray"".  *(See above.)*    
*Spineless keyboard warrior on Facebook says he's going to stab a Muslim.    
*Someone actually gets attacked.

The first is more or less an offence of stupidity and comportment.    
The second is *(potentially)* analogous to assault.    
The third is battery or worse.

Frankly I would be far more concerned about a ten percent increase of actual attacks than a thousand percent increase in ~~physical~~ online  attacks.  Neither is desirable, but they're not the same by any measure.

I don't want to draw a Nazi comparison; but people like that did their horrible things and committed their actions through dehumanising of the people they were doing them to; losing all compassion, and treating them as less than human.

Yes, I've been frustrated with our recent performances, but honestly I'm not worried. We have had a lot of injuries and can't really play the blame game. Mignolet hasn't been horrible, as some people suggest, but he's hasn't been great either. Our defense needs a better understanding of each other, one of the reasons we had an a great defense (when Steve Clarke was around) with skrtel and agger was because they understood each other very well. Let's not forget Agger was very vocal and commanded his defense. For me, this defense needs to find a leader to command it like Carra and Agger did. Manquillo and Moreno are raw, but have a lot of quality. They have easily displaced Johnson and Enrique for me. Our midfield has the potential to be amazing, but still needs time. They pulled some great pass and move and one touch passes today. Sterling is amazing and hopefully will part of our amazing and bright future. Markovic has shown great flashes, but seems to be very hesitant and hasn't shown his true abilities fully. For me our only problem is our strike force. Balo is great at hold up, but appears to be lacking a partner to take off some of the pressure. the villa game clearly showed this when the defense was picking and provoking him. This is where sturridge comes in. He offers an extra dynamic. Balo is more in your face type of striker, while Sturridge has more finesse and flash to him. Not that Balo doesn't, bit he doesn't it as often as Sturridge. I honestly believe it will only be a matter of time before this team gels and we will be playing like last year.

&gt;

&gt;__Daredevil__ is a fictional character, a [superhero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero) that appears in comic books published by [Marvel Comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics). The character was created by [writer-editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_editor) [Stan Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Lee) and artist [Bill Everett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Everett), with an unspecified amount of input from [Jack Kirby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Kirby),  and first appeared in *Daredevil* #1 (April 1964).

&gt;Living in the [Hell's Kitchen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell%27s_Kitchen,_Manhattan) neighborhood of New York City, __Matt Murdock__ is blinded by a radioactive substance that falls from an oncoming vehicle. While he no longer can see, the radioactive exposure heightens his remaining senses beyond normal human ability. His father, a boxer named Jack Murdock, supports him as he grows up, though Jack is later killed by gangsters after refusing to [throw a fight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_fixing). After donning a yellow and dark red, and later an all dark red costume, Matt seeks out revenge against his father's killers as the superhero Daredevil, fighting against his many enemies including [Bullseye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullseye_(comics\)) and [the Kingpin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingpin_(comics\)).  Daredevil's nickname is ""the Man Without Fear"". 

&gt;While *Daredevil* had been home to the work of comic-book artists such as Everett, Kirby, [Wally Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wally_Wood), [John Romita, Sr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Romita,_Sr.), and [Gene Colan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Colan), among others, [Frank Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Miller_(comics\))'s influential tenure on the title in the early 1980s cemented the character as a popular and influential part of the [Marvel Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Universe). Daredevil has since appeared in many various forms of media including several animated series, video games and merchandise, and the 2003 feature-length film *[Daredevil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(film\))*, where he was portrayed by [Ben Affleck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Affleck). [Charlie Cox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Cox) will play Daredevil in [Marvel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Studios)'s upcoming *[Daredevil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(TV_series\))* live-action television series.

false,The_Sassinator,lfc55,,"Well, from what I've heard, there was a huge influx of subscribers coming in off last season (myself included, though that was more because I'd never bothered to check for an LFC subreddit prior than anything else). Most of these supporters are likely new supporters who saw a fast-paced attack with what might have been the most dangerous strike partnership in Europe, let alone England, as the spearhead. Cut to a year later and Suarez is playing Indonesian U-19s in Barca stripes, and our attack is slower, our defence is still shit, and we've struggled to settle into any groove like last year. People are impatient, they want to see results, and they want to see them soon. They want to support the electrifying side they saw last year.

The fact of the matter is that we're not that same side, and all these problems are not solvable by simply benching Gerrard ""because he's old and shite and we have to move on from him because five games is enough to judge someone's season-long fitness"" (/s), and it's not ""Lovren and Sakho!!!!!"" at CB because they're just as bad as any other defensive combination, and coming with knives out at Rodgers? Yes, he's made some questionable moves, but give the man a break, he has an entirely new backline (discounting Sakho, but he was still a sub last year) to work with, his star striker is injured, Gerrard is being man-marked like no other, other teams try to bully Balotelli, and Sterling is far too young to be bearing all the responsibility of creating attacks and scoring on them as well. 

Wins will come, and the kinks will be ironed out. We looked a hell of a lot better in today's match than weeks past, so stop looking at the Derby as if it was some sort of death knell. They stole one from us, nothing more, nothing less. It couldn't even be blamed on bad defending or bad goalkeeping, Jagielka's strike was nothing short of miraculous for the Everton side. God himself couldn't save that shot. Once Sturridge is back in the line-up, the attack will be more creative, and most sides will no longer be able to devote a man to marking Gerrard. I'm almost certain that whether Studge starts against Basel or next week, we'll have a much-improved attack. Hopefully it can balance out our defence.

I completely disagree, he can't handle pressure, he is not good defensively and he is not good with tactics, only thing he can do is head the ball. It's not about forming a Sakho/Lovren partnership, Skrtel is just not good enough. Defenders should be able to defend, it doesn't matter if he can make it up in the offensive department. Last night against Everton, we saw how absolutely atrocious he is at handling pressure situations, always behind the defender, ignoring calls from his teammates to push forward, dragging the whole backline back. He is always going to do that he is 29 he can't just start handling pressure. 

It's completely understandable why Sakho lashed out, everyone can see Skrtel's shortcomings, except Rodgers.

Finally, Danny projecting his soldier issues on the Doctor, we get it.  He was pushed so hard he killed a woman.

Danny is concerned for Clara's safety because he **knows what men like the Doctor are like.** Not in a ""gonna steal my gf"" way but in a ""possibly too driven military commander"" way. The whole point of the scene with Danny behaving like a good soldier was to drive home the point that he sees the Doctor for what he really is.

And he was dead right.

&gt;Young people out of work for more than six months face losing access to jobseeker's allowance (JSA) if the Conservatives win the next election.

&gt;They would have to undertake tasks such as cleaning local parks to continue receiving income support, George Osborne told the Mail on Sunday.

&gt;Under his proposals, unemployed 18-21 year olds would not be able to claim jobseeker's allowance, but would instead be entitled to a ""youth allowance"".

&gt;It would be set at the same level as JSA - currently Â£57.35 for those aged 16-24.

&gt;After six months looking for work or training, to continue receiving the allowance they would have to take part in ""community projects"".

&gt;Those young people would also be prevented from claiming housing benefit.

&gt;""It is not acceptable for young people under the age of 21 to go straight from school on to benefits and into a home paid for through housing benefit - benefit funded by other people who are working,"" the chancellor added.

&gt;Single parents and young people leaving care and other vulnerable groups would be exempt from the changes, the paper reported.

In the UK there are two different products marketed as Benadryl antihistamine tablets, the ""[Benadryl one-a-day](https://www.boots.com/en/Benadryl-One-A-Day-Allergy-Tablets-7-Pack_5079/)"" which contain cetrizine, and the ""[Benadryl allergy relief](https://www.boots.com/en/Benadryl-Allergy-Relief-24-Capsules_11361/)"" which contain acrivastine.

You make a good point about foreigners only buying in certain areas. Though that does put pressure on housing all over London. 

There are a few contradictions in your post though. Firstly you cite open door immigration as the reason house prices are so high - despite earlier saying it wasn't foreigners fuelling the housing price boom.

Cameron didn't specify that 100K homes were to be built in London, this is in the whole of the country. If 800K homes are needed now in London how many will be needed in 3 or 4 years when they decide to do something about it? Yes it is good our over lords are finally throwing down some scraps to us, they need to do more though.

With respect to your point about how many properties people can own. I have no problem with people having economic freedom when they are doing something productive in the economy. Buy to let is the opposite of that, it is pure rent seeking. There is a housing shortage and people are taking advantage and making money hand over fist as a consequence without adding any value.

It used to be reliable, you could feel ""safe"" on JSA knowing you'll be ok until you find new work. With our current government though, they have massively increased the pressure on the unemployed (and sick/disabled/vulnerable in general). They are very trigger-happy with what they call sanctions, basically taking any excuse possible to immediately cut you off from any support. Many people on JSA now live in constant fear/worry that they will be made homeless or starve.

Housing Benefit is where your (now local, instead of state) government pays your rent if you cannot pay it yourself. Someone who lives alone and is on JSA, is typically on housing benefit too. HB exists because otherwise, losing your job would also mean losing your house. Your life would be over. 

Again, our current right-leaning government is actively taking steps to make things more difficult for the vulnerable or poor.

Thought the same about Sakho needing a run. For me, he improved game-on-game during his recent games and (arguably) looked better than Lovren and Skrtel recently.

No excuse for him storming out but can understand him reacting in frustration after a stop-start season last year and then, after finally getting a run for a few games and seemingly doing ok compared to Lovren &amp; Skrtel, being immediately benched on the latter's return.

&gt; The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.

Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.

But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.

Well - as I said, with the main branches of christianity in the UK, you cannot.

You could get some crazy American church backing that kind of behaviour, but it's clearly very limited, because many of the bigger christian churches have a clear power structure and the leaders can (and often do) speak out.  Islam has no such power structure.

&gt; If a white person commits a crime its just that person who's blamed but if a Muslim commits the same crime it's sensationalised like crazy.

The thing is that when you're a minority, you automatically become a bit of an ambassador for your the rest of your group.  That's because not others are unlikely to have met many from your minority (hence the term minority).  

If you go to Tallinn (for example) the impression of British tourists is poor.  That's because there are relatively fewer Brits than Estonians, so the fact that the few Brits they see are drink and pissing in a fountain means they will inevitably extend this view to more (all?) Brits.  What's worse is that rowdy, misbehaving people will stand out, whereas the decent Brits who go to Tallinn for a more laid back holiday won't be noticed.  My point is that the media's behaviour isn't ""abnormal"" it's just an extension of the phenomenon you see at community level.

Consequently, the good majority need to stand out more to impact public opinion - and they need to do this by going the extra mile.  Posting on a forum isn't going to cut it - everyone does that.  The double standard is implicit and is the unfortunate nature of being in a minority group.

An odd example, perhaps, is that when I was on holiday in Europe somewhere where a US warship had docked.  There were navy personnel obviously enjoying some time off on shore.  Some were having a little too much fun and became ""disruptive"".  The US Navy Military Police jumped in immediately to deal with the problem (in a very typical American - but 'gunless' - fashion I might add) and seemed to be working with the local police force.  

Now, they could have let the local police deal with the problem, but by keeping ownership of the problem, the US Navy showed a distinct level of professionalism and was able to correct the awful impression that their crew might have left.

The NotInMyName hashtag thing was good example of banding together to denounce something bad.   Of course diluting it with a tasteless and sarcastic/funny MuslimApologies (for algebra etc) a few days later was crass and a undermined the original idea (in another month, it would have been hilarious.)

&gt;It would be set at the same level as JSA - currently Â£57.35 for those aged 16-24.

Is no one bothering to research thing before they react anymore, sure you can object to the fact that the objective is clearly to treat 18-21 year olds separately, but they are not just removing any and all unemployment benefits as the majority of comments ITT suggest.

I've had some shocking experiences with UK trained hair stylists when discussing product ingredients and mild skin conditions, and they are trained to the same level as beauticians.

Do you know that brand uses scientifically proven ingredients at the right concentration and pH? How much hard sell will you get, will you leave your debit cards at home that day? Can you afford their products long term? Are you willing to be tough and ask for research to back their claims?

Looking at the Environ website I have mixed feelings. On the one hand it's great they know nutrition is important but supplements are not universally safe, I hope those unqualified in healthcare are not 'prescribing'. They also seem to be using decent actives in their skincare, but there are no ingredients lists.

People who are 22 now still have never had a chance to vote. 
That'd be everone this effects for instance.
If they are exclusively self interested voters, they won't be voting on under 21 issues they've already passed that point.

Others will be voting having just turned 18 and not yet being engaged in politics or having fully formed opinions yet. I'd bet if you break down the vote of that demographic by year, you'd see an increase from 18 to 24.

It's alright saying ""you youngsters should get out and vote, if you want things to change in your favour"", but for everyone you get through to that's one more voting in the next demographic at the next election, and who'll be replaced by some other kid with a not-seeing-the-point attitude until they figure that actually yes this shit does affect them, does affect the apprentice wages they are paid just in-time for them to move on from their apprenticeships and get a new bunch of priorities.

THe youngest demographic will always have a naive attiude, you are of course right we should do our best to encourage them, but there are reasons for a low turnout. It takes a little while of being exposed to the real world to figure out how it all works. 

Last election a lot of this demographic voted for the lib dems based on certain education based election pledges. That obviously went well. They gave the lib dems an edge and a few extra seats. And got higher tuition fees in return. Is it any wonder they are disillusioned.

I would also have, not a full beard but stubble so I looked older. My screwdriver would be similar to what it is now but slimer and with a red light on it. 

The TARDIS would be a bit brighter the Capaldi's TARDIS though I would probably move the Library into the main console room or as much of it as I could so if I needed information I could get it and come back quickly. The pool might be there as well since it could possibly be in the library.

I would travel with someone smart. Not too smart though as I would have to be the smartest in the room though I would lime the intellectual challenge, my brain would need stimulating, probably Psi from Time Heist. I would not limit my companion to one either. I would probably have three maximum. Lots of different people to bounce off ideas then.

I would be a, not dark Doctor but I would not want to be messed with or challenged and be a little bit insane as my regeneration from Twelve would have gone slightly wrong. I would have a joke about the situation, or at least try to as probably most of my jokes would fall flat as being an alien I would still not grasp Human Social Interaction. I would help out when I can and stop the enermy by any means of I had too because I would see the beauty in everything and that must be protected. After I have saved everyone or as many as I can I would slip back into my TARDIS and fade into the shadows again, ready to help again if there was trouble on my travels. I probably would say something like, ""I should get paid for this.""

I would go anywhere in the universe as the universe is my playground, and my TARDIS is my swing. Swinging me into where I am needed and where I want to go.

Create some jobs then. How dare they lay the blame of unemployment on the poor. Do they think I wanted to be out of work for a year? Was that my choice?

In arguing anecdote isn't a great way to draw broad political conclusions. You begin your post by talking about your own situation of having to move back in with your parents. You have your safety net but the concern here is that some other people do not so your anecdote isn't really addressing the concern.

Next you go on to make a point that you trust the policy is thought out. Really? You can't imagine a government implementing something dumb?

Good point about the tweet.

Your next point is that you don't know about the data. It's very easy to find out. Google, the ONS website etc. If you want to make a good post look into some of the journalism and raw stats on the internet, it's easy enough to find.

The next thing I would say is an observation on the differences between our generation. You're 23 and think it's normal to live at home. I'm 49. When I was 23 I knew next to no one my age who still lived at home. I knew some people who had already begun repaying their 25 year mortgages. It seems very sad to me how that's changed.

Hysteria? Not quite.

Actual key points:

* Housing benefit **banned** for 18-21 year olds. (Why the fuck is everybody ignoring this?)
* 18-21s forced into slave labour after 6 months of unemployment - changing the social contract - no mention of any change in income taxes/NI based on this new lower level of insurance.
* Savings made from forcing young people to not live independently anymore will be put towards apprenticeships - so that young people can instead work for Â£2.50 an hour, and still not live independently.

For one thing, if you're on JSA they're always harping on about how looking for work is a ""full time job itself"" - so how does that work when you're also working for the government in order to receive your pittance Â£57.50 a week so you can eat?

I really don't understand - there's now more young people in training/education than ever before, so what problem is this really intended to solve? Plus, they think cutting support for young people will help get people *out* of poverty? What a disgusting and degrading statement to make. If you're not a success, you're just not trying hard enough, don't ya know. I'm sure they learn that at Eton probably.

Why can't someone move out at 18, work, and expect to be protected if they lose their job? They need housing benefit for one thing - and that's been totally scrapped for 18-21s.

false,Lozzy1256,null,null,"Last year husband and I camped in October. We have odd schedules so that was our summer holiday. We live in Scotland anyway so we thought, why not have a cheap holiday, it can't be that cold. Well... it can.

My general mild cold that I seem to have between September and March turned into a full blown chest infection that took three lots of anti-biotics to clear, and my husband came home covered in chapped skin. However, we both really really enjoyed ourselves. 

My advice to you is this:

Make sure you've got proper gear. I wouldn't camp without a sealed inner, not one of those ones that's got the clips. The wind and rain can be very driving at that time of year, especially the further north you go, so any little gaps (and no matter how well the inner fits, they always leave little gaps) will result in a terrible draft.

Make sure you have a great rollmat to lie on. You're going to need really good insulation from the ground. We eneded up going and buying a super cheap duvet and putting it on top of our roll mats to provide extra layers (it was also a lot more comfy to sleep on!). Our roll mats were pretty decent ones, and it just wasn't enough. I woke up that first morning and felt like a dementor had sucked all my blood out through the ground. Very cold! If you've got the space/weight then one of those self-inflating air roll mats could be very handy!

Eat hot meals as much as you can. You need to keep your tempterature up and a big bowl of porridge in the morning will set you up and warm your belly. Something my mum made me do every morning before school in winter and unfortunately she was right, despite the fuss I made at the time.

Sleeping bags: Get a sleeping bag that has a comfort rating of -3 deg min. That should be adequate, although if you get cold during the day it might not be enough to keep you warm all night. So... don't get cold during the day.

For day to day stuff, do all the usual stuff - thermals, breathable layers, don't get wet! Take loads of extra socks - when I camp I just wear socks all the time, even in bed! And remember an awesome water and wind proof coat! And a hat!

Make sure you check the weather on your phone every day, the weather, like other people have said, is VERY changeable, so while you might set off and things are fine, the next day could be terrible weather, and then you're looking at the possibility of flash floods, etc. Not good. So keep on top of the weather.

Let me know if you've got any other questions, and make sure to update us if you do go! :) Enjoy ",0,1411899694,null,0,false,0,ckulu29,t3_2hjgmw,t1_ckulu29,t3_2hjgmw,null,1426786209,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

Given how fortunate we are as a country to have dedicated national stadiums without a home team it doesn't seem that unlikely that the FA would have to do something. They can't really force a club to reduce capacity at a smaller ground. And it seems like the space issue is something practically limited to London.

It seems quite likely that any negotiations would require the other, usually musical events, to be moved. Which seems possible but will require the other venues exceeding their current cap. But probably spreading the events out. The 30 games a season we would need is pretty difficult but not impossible. The fact that these plans are coming out now puts us in an infinitely better position. We can negotiate on improvements and be at the advantage of essentially booking the stadium before the other acts.

Really the main problem is actually what would happen to the Rugby. Which I definitely don't have an answer for. Although the Millennium stadium would probably love it if Union finals were there along with the other small tournaments.

And yeah to fill an 80k game they do have station problems but I don't believe they do that every week and they have a lot of events that don't fill the stadium. Also the likelihood that the station would be slightly upgraded by 17/18 is quite high.

I had my Assessment about a month ago, and last week got a phone call saying that even though I was clearly too ill to work without some kind of assistance, I'd failed the medical and would have to go back to signing on JSA.

I've read all the literature and asked the right questions and I **still** have absolutely no idea what the Work Related Activity group does and what kind of narrow band of illness or disability you need to be in to qualify for it.

It's rapidly looking like I'm going to be one of the ones who get stuck in the middle - too ill for JSA, not ill enough for ESA, and it's frightening me, to be honest.

&gt; Single parents and young people coming out of care and other âvulnerableâ groups would be exempt.

Their plumbing sucks, their batteries and gen's suck. they have no insulation and no security bar a padlock so it really is a case of 'buyer beware' and now the waterways are full too.

(and network connectivity tends to be shit in various locations)

Basically just don't buy an old boat... really just don't. There's really only one reason *anyone* would want an old boat. (they tend to have proper toilets and a bilge tank instead of a chemical cartridge bed pan designed for midgets)

If you want a boat either be a very concerned customer or have it designed yourself 'for a lifestyle' AND have a permanent berth for it so expect to pay some were upwards of 200K. 

eg, you really need to take into account practicalities. If you want to be mobile you're cooking on gas... might seem obvious but people miss it a lot cos they seem to think electricity just materialises. Most boat's run on 12 and 24V DC (not 240AC). You're not getting cable TV and you're not getting Sky (unless you got another 100k to spend). Bigger boats are harder to deal with and old narrow boats can be up to 7'2"" wide (not 7' ~ scrapey scrape). 

Comfier boats are dutch wide (14 foot) but they can't really go many places in the UK.  (cool for a holiday in Europe though).

All that said though... some custom boats are Sci-Fi as fuck. I know a guy that can drive his house using a mobile phone and can tell it to pick him up from the pub.

No fault of his own, but he's gotten older, lost a bit of pace and he never was a clinical finisher even in his prime. 

I'll be very disappointed if we don't pick up a striker in January, even if it's just Rodriguez who I think is an excellent player and offers something different to all three of our current crop.

You may expect them to make the first move as the host nation, but you can't really count on it - they are as scared of talking to you as you may be of them, so don't feel like you can't just talk to them, they'll be perfectly happy to chat (although you may have to educate them as to Singapore's location, sorry). Example topic of conversation: football, since the EPL is probably as popular in Singapore as it is in England.

British males who are friends have a tendency to mock and make fun of each other. If someone you are friendly with does this, don't be offended or upset, it's probably a sign of friendship.

British people's sense of humour can be a little weird to the uninitiated, and there will probably be a lot of pop culture references you miss out on at first. If you want to get up to speed on British culture, the best place to start is the comedy, happy to give you a list.

I do, however, think that some young people are not able to ""think outside the box"" in terms of their career options. Just because you got a degree in psychology doesn't mean you HAVE to get a job in that field! Many of the skills you use to get a 2:1 or above at uni are applicable across the board, and people need to appreciate that there are more jobs than just the obvious. 

Though in all honesty this is also to do with the way employers act like you have to have a degree in a 100% related field to work in their establishment, and also the way that young people in the UK are forced to choose what they want to do with their lives at 16. I mean, if someone doesn't know what they want to do when they leave school and chooses Biology, English Literature, Psychology, Drama, as their A-levels because they got A*-C in them at GCSE, suddenly a hell of a lot of degrees are unavailable to them. If someone decided that actually, they'd like to study Accounting, or Economics, or History, or anything scientific, they would not be able to (most science degrees prefer the student to have A level maths). 

I think many of the issues that come with specialising too early would be fixed if students maintained a wider variety of subjects (similar to GCSE or Scottish Highers).

The BBC has said exactly why this happened.  Reuters got a report from firefighters on the ground the building was in danger of collapse (as that video shows they were concerned of, from the NIST report) and they were evacuating the immediate area, you know like they do at many fires.  This was incorrectly reported on by a local station as a collapse that HAD actually happened, and in the chaos of the day, BBC and CNN both reported on it without looking into it.

I'm not even asking for cuts to pensioners' benefits, more a suggestion that we take the billions we decided we'd spend on harassing jobseekers, the disabled and long term sick, and instead maybe spend it on helping them.  Wouldn't take any more money, would just mean we're giving it to poor people who'd spend it in the local economy instead of handing it to already discredited foreign companies like ATOS.

It's no surprise the economy is screwed when so few people can afford to spend.

As for your housing comments, that could be spun as an attack on pensioners too, they're not going to vote to see their house values slashed so that young people might be able to afford to live.

From what i have seen as a heavy user:

* 3 (current provider for 1 year) 

Covers almost all of bristol, i have lost signal rarely but whenever i have its been in a room where i can walk 5 feet and get at least one bar. in the centre i get 4G at about 2-3 bars. The only problem i have had is outside of bristol (another city) or when i'm in the country (on the train or a road trip not on the motorway) where i get no signal at all.

*  T-Mobile/Orange/EE (as of 1 year ago for 5 years)

Much the same case as 3 but even less rare in and around bristol to not have signal. i could be almost anywhere and i would see a bar, simple as. But then it cost x2

* Vodafone (my second phone in the household)

poor if not extremely poor signal that cuts in and out. never seen a 4g signal in bristol but in other cities it works a charm (london, leeds, liverpool etc) and on the train 1 or no bars.

*  A few Friend have O2 or Tesco (same network)

is like a bad mix of patchy in bristol and patchy outside, many times i will have a full EE/3 singal and they will have nothing but most of them say they have good signal overall.

false,idonthavearewardcard,newcr-8,FÃ©nomenal,"Moyes brought much needed stability and discipline. He achieved a lot in his 10 years on a shoestring budget and with a poor squad, but his approach was very much one of pragmatism. When playing the bigger teams he often spoke of 'bringing a knife to a gun fight' and said that he'd achieved all he could while at Everton.

When I found out he was leaving, I was worried about the future. Moyes gave the impression that we were constantly punching above our weight. Would Everton become one of these mid table clubs? Would we get relegated if we have a bad season? Maybe I thought Moyes was bigger than Everton and his departure would be the beginning of the end. I was unsure of the Martinez appointment too, he had had been relegated with Wigan and had presided over some pretty heavy losses despite bringing the FA cup to Wigan.

However, things changed when around September last year when we had an excellent deadline day transfer window and Roberto got into his winning ways. There was a mentality of plucky outsider that was holding us back. We could compete with and beat the Chelseas, the Aresenals, the Manchester Uniteds. Not through luck and chance but by playing better than them, taking the game to them and by playing football instead of staying disciplined and waiting for a break. It's beautiful to watch too. Perhaps it's easier to appreciate attacking football than it is a steadfast defence but I'd take the insecurity and entertainment of continental flair over Protestant work ethic any day. This might seem a bit harsh in that Moyes did start playing better football after he'd established a team and there were some exciting games but it still represented a tentative approach to taking risks.

Moyes said some disparaging things and put in some derisory bids for some Everton players, but I don't really care about that. Circumstances change and different personnel are required for different situations. Roberto has made us dream again. There will be ups and down but it's much more exciting and fulfilling than aiming for caution and stability.

I still wish Moyes the best of luck in the future. I think he was completely fucked over at Manchester United. He didn't get the transfers he wanted. He inherited a poor squad. The old guard revolted over stupid shit like chips and he had to follow Alex Ferguson who is probably the greatest club football manager of the last Century. He also had the media looking to jump on him whenever possible whereas Van Gaal seems to have been let off a little. He's proved himself as a good manager and he could definitely turn it around at somewhere like Newcastle and make St.James Park somewhere where you don't expect to pick up points.

So I guess, farewell and good luck. You were right to teach Rio to play like Jagielka.

There's just some of us who like to turn to the end of the novel first.

As one who fancies himself a writer, I enjoy seeing the creative process, of seeing words on paper turn into scenes on the screen, as well as seeing earlier takes refined to their final form.  The loss of the surprise factor at the twists that might be in the story isn't a big deal--one can always sort of synthesize that feeling when watching the final product.  In fact, knowing and understanding the story in advance allows me to focus more on the details--the acting, the dialogue, the visuals--without having to keep up with the plot's twists and turns.

Obviously not everyone's like this, and I don't begrudge anyone who wants to keep themselves spoiler-free going into each episode (though I do raise an eyebrow at the oversensitive ones who can't even bear to watch a promo or read an official article or a TV guide listing--I mean, come on, this is stuff the BBC wants you to know ahead of time).

I'm now 20, with a dozen A+ GCSEs, A-Levels and a year of university under my belt, and after realising that at the end of my Philosophy BA I'd be competing with 1000s for the little specialised jobs there are I dropped out. Now I work a minimum wage job at McDonalds wondering just what went wrong.

Yet when I search for new jobs there are plenty in healthcare, construction, finance, security, etc. But the majority of these require some form of licencing or formal training. Which is fine, but when they can cost Â£1-2k+ to acquire after college there's no hope of me getting enough money together while on Â£5.03 an hour. And apprenticeships? Not a chance I could survive on Â£2.68 per hour, I'd be better off on benefits.

I'm not afraid of manual labour, but I've been chained by educational decisions I made when I was 14.

Unfortunately these sorts of shoddy student accommodations are not uncommon, neither are restrictive tenancy agreements that make it difficult to get out of a bad situation. 

First off, give your contract a read over, check it for any break clauses or get outs to see if you can exploit those, but chances are this company has it fairly well sewn up. 

Next, get yourself down to your local citizen's advice bureau (CAB), it's a not for profit legal advice charity that may be able to offer you some help and support, however it is usually fairly general and more needy cases may take precedence; they're often overworked and underfunded, so do bear that in mind when you go. You can help by being patient and having all your paperwork and correspondence with you before you go. Some may offer an appointment, others will be a drop in service where you have to turn up at 8.30AM and wait to be seen. If you have the means, hiring your own solicitor is a better option. Most will give you a thirty minute free consultation to advise you of your chances of success and set out their fees. 

Your students union is also worth a visit. Some have an approved landlords scheme, and may threaten non-compliant or rogue landlords with de-accreditation. Your universities faculty of law (if it has one) is also worth an email, they may be able to offer the services of a student solicitor for pro bono or discounted advice. 

Noise complaints are handled by the local council, but be wary of taking this route, you may alienate your neighbours, and they won't be able to help you get out of your contract, but a couple of visits from the council enforcement officers *might* help you get some respite. 

Finally, try to avoid any further verbal ""run ins"" with the housing manager, insist on all further communication to be in writing, ideally by email or letter, and stick to that rule yourself. If you have anything to say, make sure you have a photocopy or digital copy of it. Get your correspondence organised and be prepared to refer to it when necessary.

Agger's comments last week about leaving because of BR were a bit alarming, especially considering Agger's personality and loyalty to Liverpool. 

I basically feel Rodgers has a ruthless, somewhat nasty streak in him that emerges from time to time. It's fine, probably even necessary to have that in football, but basically just don't think we should be saying he's a total saint. 

This is essentially a much more limited version of the problem I have with Mourinho. He's gotten this totally undeserved reputation of being this horse whisperer for players, the world's preeminent man manger. In fact, he's just a spiteful cunt who will marginalise players at will because he's allowed to buy superstar replacements. He shattered that Real Madrid dressing room and within two years Ancelotti wins the European Cup with them. That's not man management, it's in fact the total opposite. 

There are definitely players in our squad who Rodgers didn't want to buy or doesn't want now, but part of being a good manager is making sure those players are still utilised if they're talented. See Pardew's treatment of Hatem Ben Arfa for an example of a bad manager. Sakho seems on his way to being marginalised, and if it's for mistakes that's bullshit as Lovren has been just as guilty. Sakho is immense for France with Varane next to him, so I think BR should be looking to figure out how to replicate that at Anfield rather than freezing out a talented, not to mention expensive, player.

false,Subotan,eng-lancashire,Lancashire,"&gt;Most extreme is perhaps the new right for corporations to contest and sue governments. This is a first; in its sharpest version it might lead, according to some analysts, to a parallel legal system under the control of the corporations. Thus specialized lawyers will handle the arbitration courts and represent the corporations. There is no accountability to a higher court, or a body that represents the people of a country or of a sub-national jurisdiction.

This isn't that extreme. European Law is basically this. The reason this clause has been included is so that if you're an American firm which makes Gizmos in Bulgaria, and the Bulgarian government screws you over somehow or another Bulgarian firm robs your patent, you don't have to rely on the Bulgarian court system to judge punishments for its paymasters on breaches of the TTIP. 

&gt;The United States data are disturbing: it has basically lost 2.7 million jobs since the mid-1990s through trade agreements âand 40,000 linked directly to the new US-South Korea free trade agreement.[3] The politicians know this, but only a minority is concerned, with the rest happily accepting the self-serving analyses of the corporations themselves. [4] 

This is stupid. Saying that ""2.7 million jobs have disappeared since 1996"" does not suggest that ""Trade agreements negotiated in 1996 destroyed 2.7 million jobs"" anymore than ""Space Jam has destroyed 2.7 million jobs since 1996"". If anything, those trade agreements will have prevented even more jobs from having being lost. A positive economist's (Krugman) evaluation of NAFTA can be found [here](http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/49394/paul-krugman/the-uncomfortable-truth-about-nafta-its-foreign-policy-stupid) - a more critical evaluation by De Long which acknowledges NAFTA's effects have been positive if disappointing can be found [here](http://delong.typepad.com/pdf/20061223_DeLong_Aftathoughts_on_NAFTA.pdf).

The obsession on some parts of the Left with trade is shrill and confusing. It has no bearing on reality - nevermind that none of the claims being made are true, if you're concerned about jobs use fiscal, monetary or exchange rate policy to boost short-term employment. Restricting trade doesn't do anything except keep people employed in inefficient positions. Even then, why the level of vitriol and anger for something so beneficial to people in poorer countries? Why does the Left have such a problem with something which is so cosmopolitan and breaks down national barriers between people? Why can't they mobilize this level of anger and political activism towards the Conservative government and its policies?",0,1411917046,null,0,false,0,ckupvhm,t3_2hosr2,t1_ckupvhm,t3_2hosr2,null,1426784324,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

false,takesthebiscuit,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"From [what has Europe done](http://www.whathaseuropedone.eu/)

The EU has provided us with not only safer flights but also cheaper flights and increased competition between carriers registered in the Member States. Cheaper flights are the knock-on effect of a huge improvement in air traffic management and increased competition.


  
Student Exchange Programmes
Within the last 10 years the EU has created different education programmes in order to give students the possibility to experience different national cultures and broaden their personal horizon. Up to now 1.2 million students have benefited from the ERASMUS Programme and many more are expected to experience it in the future.


  
The Single Market
The Single Market is one of a kind as it guarantees âfree movement' of people, goods, services and capital. At a practical level, it provides the possibility for EU citizens to live, work, study and do business throughout the EU, as well as enjoy a wide choice of competitively priced goods and services.


 
Protection of Intellectual Property
Intellectual property deals with two areas: industrial property and copyrights. Basically, it means that you are not allowed to use somebody else's ideas, for example, if your best friend has written lyrics to a song, you can not publish it in your name. The EU's efforts in this area have resulted in laws aiming at protecting company's or individual's knowledge.


  
Peace
Peace in Europe was first created when an alliance was made between Germany and France and the European Coal and Steel Community was founded. Europe has come along way since with a lasting peace amongst its Member States. International security is now a major issue for the EU: with increasing threats to a peaceful society in different areas of the world, the EU has put in place many policies to combat such problems.


  
The Euro
The single currency, the Euro, is now part of our everyday life but not all of its benefits are well known. From the practical advantages of travelling with a single currency, to the benefits of economic growth, to the strengthening of the EU international role and its political integration, the introduction of the euro has achieved much more than people expected.


  
Regional Funds
Unity and solidarity are some of the most significant aims for the EU. One important reason why the European regional policies have been created is because the EU is of the opinion that equal standards and rights should be provided to all citizens.


 
Cheaper and Better Phone calls
The liberalisation of the telecommunication markets in 1998 and the ongoing development in the field of technology have resulted in a steady decrease in prices within the EU. This means that it is cheaper to call your friends and family and choose between different operators.


  
Consumer Protection
NEW: Consumer protection and the safety of food in the European Union are two issues that have always gone hand in hand. The Health and Consumer Protection Directorate General's main responsibility is to provide laws and regulations on the safety of food and consumer rights.


  
A Healthier Europe
The public health issues dealt with by the EU are numerous and cover a number of different areas. They concern both men and women, young and old. The EU has also introduced the European health insurance card that is your guarantee if you should fall ill when going abroad.



Environmental Protection
In the EU, environmental issues including initiatives concerning protection have been underlined as some of the most important points not only for discussion but also for action. For instance, the EU is leading the ""Kyoto"" drive to reduce the air pollution that causes global warming.

Equal Opportunities - Against Discrimination
The promotion of equal opportunities and the fight against Discrimination are considered some of the most important issues within Europe and many directives have been put in place to combat inequalities that occur in the Member States. 2007 is officially the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All. Additionally the ""Roadmap for equality between women and men 2006-2010"" was launched outlining 6 priority areas for EU action on gender equality.


External Trade
External trade for Europe has always been very important to the success of the European Union. In recent years our level of trade has increased and we are continuing to grow as major players in the world of trade. Today, the EU accounts for 20% of global imports and exports and is now the world's biggest trader.

The first time it was reported that he had contracted Malaria was mid-July and that we would be leaving him in the UK rather than bringing him on the North American trip. Presumably it was before the announcement, so say beginning of July/End of June.

Now it seems that the form of Malaria can have a massive impact on recovery but based on the fact that Ade was in camp in July and has been doing conditioning/practice/prep for every game this season it seems very likely that Ade had one of the more benign version of Malaria or else why would we be letting him practice and sapping himself of energy needed to fully recover?

Now according to the [little blurb on](http://www.malaria.com/questions/malaria-recovery-time-2) Malaria.com the most basic answer to ""How long does it take to recover from malaria?"" is as follows:

&gt;A number of different factors affect recovery time from malaria. These include the type of malaria, how quickly treatment is administered and the immune status of the patient. For example, children and pregnant women tend to get much more severe cases of malaria, due to their reduced natural immunity. 

&gt;The type of malaria will impact on the severity and length of the infection as wellâP. falciparum is the most severe kind, and can result quickly in death if not treated promptly, whereas less rapidly progressing forms of malaria, such as P. malariae, may persist for longer but not cause severe disease. **For most cases of uncomplicated malaria, once the appropriate form of treatment is started, the patient will start to recover within a couple of days.** 

So based on anecdotal evidence observed by a non-medical specialist it seems that Ade should have been showing signs of recovery by the end of July (if not earlier) and now on what is closing on 90 days he should be recovered enough that it isn't an issue **OR** if he is still fighting to recover we shouldn't be playing him for his own good so he can recover fully.

Either way at this point either he is likely recovered and playing like shit or still suffering from the illness and shouldn't be training/playing.

To me it seems more likely that he is just off form and in a bit of a funk and may benefit from being dropped from the lineup for a match or two to see if it lights a fire under his ass.",0,1411917871,null,0,1411918825,0,ckuq66l,t3_2hot6t,t1_ckuq66l,t1_ckumgf5,null,1426784185,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

Keeping that in mind, it wouldn't make sense to pressure the other team in their half (seems like only Lamela was asked to do this).

He had a 4 year reign and this was more or less the years 10 lived. He was loved by practically everyone and so the send off was not just for him, but for us. It made complete sense that after 4 years in his body, he wished for more and got a big send off, since he pretty much defined Doctor Who for a modern day audience. He had so much more to give, and that was reflected in the show. The ending was an end for the RTD and Tennant era so we said goodbye to all of them. I didn't mind them doing this plainly because RTD brought back the show and got it to what it was, so I think he more than deserved to have us getting a send off for all the characters that were created under his reign. I wouldn't be surprised to see something similar done at the end of Moffat's reign.

1) Surely you would WANT Halal food to be labelled clearly if you disagree with it, in case you want to avoid it. If people see it and decide against it, then Tesco would be encouraged to change their practices regarding the meat they buy in.  
2) The idea that ""they don't advertise 'non-Halal' or vegetarian food in big letters so Tesco is unfair/biased"" is a very strange one. Halal is bought purposefully by only a minority of customers and the idea of highlighting all products equally can be reduced to ridiculousness.

Many years ago, back when you had multiple lines to have a separate one for the internet etc, we moved, the old property was knocked down. We cancelled all our lines. One of them they decided to keep connected. We didn't notice right away so it took 4 years of arguing before give us a refund (and only then back until the building was demolished, they wouldn't accept it should have been cancelled with ever other number when we moved out), it took a while to notice because their staff lied multiple times over what the charge on the bill was (claiming it was for the alarm system), the billing system being deliberately confusing, I assume to sneak charges on in the hope the  customer won't notice.  They consistently bill things wrong, promise they will fix it then don't and deny that you ever called.

false,sirbruce,null,null,"The Doctor has always disliked soldiers.  This originally manifested itself in his dislike of guns, and further became apparent with the 3rd and 4th Doctor's dealings with U.N.I.T.  It's been touched on many times since the reboot, so I don't know why this would come as a surprise.

Why?  Well, that's open to speculation.  But you have to consider that much of the time when The Doctor gets in trouble or is prevented from investigating something or fixing something that's wrong, it's because some guy points a gun at him.  And in most societies, these are going to be police or soldiers.  So he's been at the wrong end of a barrel many times.

Also, his experiences with soldiers are often negative.  In Doctor Who stories, they tend to have a ""shoot first"" mentality, particularly when dealing with aliens.  And often this is wrong -- either they are afraid of the alien but shouldn't be, or they're shooting something they don't understand, and often they're ineffective and only endanger themselves, or make matters even worse.  The Doctor is always the one who has to make things right, and soldiers rarely help the situation.  The Doctor thinks you should try to understand and communicate first, and only result to violence when necessary.   You disappoint him if your response is to break out the guns and call out the soldiers at the first sign of trouble.

Furthermore, consider that the Doctor has seen more war than anyone.  And most of those soldiers in war were far from noble.  Daleks, Cyberman, Sontarans, and so on, all militaristic races bent on galactic domination.  And how many evil man has he defeated who raised armies of soldiers to fight for them?  Who are these soldiers, always so willing to fight for an evil cause they probably don't even understand?  How disappointing they are, not to even know what they are doing?  The Doctor has certainly helped noble resistance fighters in the past, but professional military seems like a bad career choice to him.

And then you have to consider the Doctor's own personal war record.  The Time Wars.  His time as the War Doctor.  What he himself had to do in war, and why he wouldn't want anyone else to do it.  And Mr. Pink's words to Clara afterwards exactly echo what Davros told the Doctor in a previous episode: the Doctor likes to CLAIM he's nobly above it all, but he simply recruits his companions to do his dirty work for him.  The Doctor never complains where Vastra cuts down an enemy with a sword or River blows one up with a gun, even if he would rarely do it himself.  The Doctor all too often MAKES his companions into soldiers, taking his orders and fighting against evil.

Edit: It might also be interesting to point out that his own granddaughter Susan fell in love and ran off with a soldier.  So there's probably some personal bitterness about that, too.

With Soldado vs Forest, the fact his movement wasn't good and didn't get involved in play took him low (1,2,3ish) but the goal redeems a couple of points (4,5).

He was still the same man. He was just more likely to make try hard decisions for the good of all, even of it meant a double genocide. He was more likely to fight physically and use weapons than to outsmart his enemy (though I bet he still did since wars and battles require strategy as well). Before, The Doctor only saw the small picture and would help the little people. For the first time he saw the big picture and had to fight for everyone, which means tougher decisions. But he still did his best to stay true to himself and true to the promise he made long ago. Sure, he probably commited some horrors and made some tough choices that no other Doctor would have made, but he at the time he needed to do those things and did what was probably best at the time with such little notice. Because war can change in an instant, and you need to make fast decisions to adapt to the situation, and I am sure that John Hurt's Doctor made the best decisions he could in those situations.

&gt; The huge influx of people is a massive strain on our infrastructure as well

Wrong. Immigrants are a net win for our economy, so all things being equal, immigration should be beneficial to our infrastructure. Except things aren't equal. Immigrants are far more likely to be of working age than the general population, so they claim fewer benefits, use the NHS less, and claim far fewer pensions than they ""ought"" to. In consequence, immigrants are a *massive* benefit to our infrastructure and state finances.

&gt; not to mention the damage it does to our working class.

Wrong. [Here's a Home Office study that shows quite the opposite.](http://www.politics.co.uk/news/2014/03/06/home-office-slips-out-immigratiion-report-under-cover-of-pol) Immigrants have next to no effect on the chances of ""natives"" to get jobs. From the conclusion:

Forgive me, but this is one of the more absurd takes on the situation I've ever encountered.

Germany has striven for the last *fifty years* to make Frankfurt a truly global centre of commerce like London or New York, and a Brexit would finally give them to opportunity do exactly that. They can provide *their own* financial services, if given the motivation to do so - the reason they haven't aggressively developed those markets and tried to leverage Frankfurt over London is largely a consequence of not wanting to precipitate a major disagreement and making our own EU membership even more tenuous.

None of that applies if we left, and if Germany starts promoting Frankfurt widely abroad along with a more aggressive business taxation plan there is nothing on Earth special about London that will keep foreign investors there (outside the Single Market) as opposed to making the short hop across the channel so they can trade in the Eurozone from within.

&gt; ""Super Mario - Last night, initially I was angry towards him, because he didn't score, simple as that. However after watching the highlights when I was calm, I realised he was actually working pretty hard to win some of important balls back. He does walk along the pitch sometimes, but I think that's his smarts, he pick his battles and when he does go for it, he normally wins the ball. Another great thing about Mario is his confidence in himself. He will take a shot from anywhere and hopefully soon enough, they will go into the back of the net. Thats something Suarez brought to the table where even when a goal didn't seem possible, he will take a shot and make it happen. On the other hand though, Mario has been bought as a striker, so he needs to finish some of his chances""

I realize he is a world talent, but he provides service more similar to Lambert than Suarez.  While he is ambitious with his shots, he is far from relentless in pressure.  Suarez's total commitment at all times is what allowed the pressure to function.  Think of the amount of times he was screaming at the other players when they failed to close down.  I believe we need a different type of striker in January.  Someone much more mobile to partner Sturridge.  I don't pretend to know who that would be though. Obviously this post is more about his ability to fit in the team, rather than talent in regards to finishing.  If you disagree do you believe Sturridge is the man who can directly replace Suarez?

The advantage of being in a city is that there are constant job openings, the disadvantage is that there are lots of people, most older and more qualified than you, who also need work.  So while you might chance through a friend getting something decent, most likely it will not be exciting.  

But here's the thing, if you get a job as a paper boy/dishwasher/cleaner/whatever then not only will you earn a little now for what you are currently saving for, but in a couple of years, when all your friends are also wanting to get jobs to pay for cars/drink/etc then you will have the work experience to put yourself ahead of them in line in getting a better job.  Win-win really, you just need not to be fussy now to help yourself later.

Let's look at some previous arcs:

Bad Wolf-random words show up, Rose ends up becoming a godlike being, magics all the baddies away and spreads those specific words because...uh wait there's not really any connection to wolves at all?

Season 2-Daleks vs Cybermen... and then they get magically sucked through a portal because science

Season 3-Ok YANA and Saxon actually was a pretty good set up. But then the Doctor saves the day by.... having a lot of people believe in the spirit of christmas which makes him become a super saiyan/tinkerbell/jesus and also makes him young again? And then time gets reversed because... science?

Season 4-Awesome arc no complaints

2008-2010 specials-Awesome arc, ""Master race"" bit is kind of silly but hey, I think it has a great conclusion with minimal deus ex machina for once... other than the master shooting lighting somehow

Season 5-CRACKS, HEY CRACKS, BUT SERIOUSLY RORY JUST GOT ERASED FROM TIME.... and the Doctor saves the day by paradox then reboots the universe. This was also a good arc actually even though the resolution was just ""uhh paradox?""

 Season 6-HEY THERE'S THIS BIG MYSTERY! THE DOCTOR IS GONNNNNNAAAA DIEEEEEE BUT FOR REAL YOU GUYS, HE IS TOTALLY DYING.... and then um... River is Amy and Rory's kid who they suddenly grew up with because she was their secret best friend who they never mentioned before, or mentioned again, and who didn't come to their wedding, but did because she still had the diary in her future self, and this is ok, even though Amy's baby melted in her arms, and the silence stole River because she is part time lord because Rory and Amy had kinky Time Vortex sex, which the Silence knew because of reasons and so they took Amy and now Amy is infertile but that's no big deal lets go have an adventure in some kids bedroom, and the Silences' plan to kill the Doctor is to put River in a lake in a space suit...because that's a normal way to kill somebody and then have the space suit shoot the Doctor with a lazer beam because he lets it, but also River tries to stop that from happening and now Amy is a general somehow, and some other stuff, but really the Doctor was a robot and never died anyway and ummm the Silence couldn't kill him by just shooting him with lighting bolts in the back because...um... they are priests?? but also kill random ladies in the bathroom at the white house and they blew up the TARDIS almost causing the end of the universe so that they could...stop the Doctor from destroying the universe? Also the flesh copies are exactly like the originals so its a crime to kill them and now let me melt the flesh copy of Amy because I have zero short term memory. Also, we made a flesh Doctor that will never be mentioned or actually tie into the arc at all because the Doctor is going to spend hundreds of years coming to terms with his own death only to say, ""screw it let's just use a robot"" ...and the robot burns in the lake? And then in conclusion, the Doctor will have to go more undercover and keep his survival a secret which ends up changing exactly 0 of his actions. all of my ""what""

Season 7-Honestly just a set up for the 50th. Arc doesn't make a ton of sense and is barely resolved but it doesn't matter because time gets rewritten anyway.

The topic is stunned before death/ or not. 90% of halal meat is stunned before being slaughtered. 100% of halal meat in the topic (tescos) is stunned before death, just like any other meat. 

You seem to have used this opportunity to post: 
&gt;The 'concept' of halal is fucking disgusting and has no place in modern educated society.
I don't care if it offends you that I think cutting an animals throat and whilst it painfully bleeds to death you say your mumbo jumbo prayers is disgusting and barbarous, and belongs in a time well forgotten. I will happily admit that I am anti-religious in specific cases where it causes unnecessary harm.

So not only did you miss the point of the topic that none of the animals are ""bleeding painfully to death"", but you decided to inject some insulting religious hatred such as ""prayer mumbo-jumbo"". 

You also used words such as ""barbaric"" and ""disgusting"" to describe this thing that doesn't happen in the topic. 

Since you decided to take the thread away from the topic of ""halal meat advertised in tesco's"" and turn it into ""why i hate halal meat"", i decided to reply in a similar fashion.

Also out of curiosity, 

&gt; I will happily admit that I am anti-religious in specific cases where it causes unnecessary harm.

The connection between CO2 and warming is cast-iron, and was demonstrated from extremely well-understood physics by Arrhenius more than 120 years ago. The only serious question is how strong the feedback effects will be, whether the expected levels of CO2 concentrations by 2100 will result in 1.5 deg C or 6 deg C of warming.

If the police thought I had stolen someone's property (a violation of another persons natural rights), and took it to a judge who then issued a warrant based on reasonable suspicion. And the police came round my house and searched the property for stolen goods, that would not be a violation of my rights of privacy, and this is pretty much widely understood by all. 

However, if the police started breaking into everyone's house in your street, in your town, in the country and logged everything in them, copied your photos, diary etc, and maybe they might find say a couple of criminals in your town because of it, that would be a violation of **everyone's** natural right of privacy. 

The latter description is pretty much happening now with our communication data, and thus is a violation of our rights as human beings.

I guess my story arc would be all about coming to terms of being *the* Doctor - and doing what Doctor *needs* to do rather than what he simply fancies doing. That said, my favourite pastime would be just to hang that TARDIS in the middle of the universe, look at the stars and galaxies, and laze around on my bed (totally fitting that in there).

**Physique and Personality** - A little overweight, strongman young Doctor who looks more like Bob the Builder than a member of an intelligent species. Unlike previous Doctors, the 13th is not witty, cannot turn a phrase and speaks like an everyman - he is VERY bad at explaining things to the companions, leaving them to figure things out for themselves. I would also be a slightly immoral doctor, cowardly unless pressed hard enough - probably leading to at least one companion leaving me because I wasn't there for them. I'm also the Doctor who prefers to leave it all alone and let the Daleks rampage - unless someone else pushes me to do the heroics. I'd be the first Doctor who is genuinely indifferent to humans and even dislikes many of their qualities - it's up to my companion to prove me wrong. 

**Companion** - One Female to start with (although I'd actually think a married couple would be fun to deal with, third-wheeling on my way to save the universe) - has to be proactive and someone who wishes to change me and lead me rather than the other way around. Has to make me go fight cybermen while I'd rather enjoy some Planet Paradise with warm beaches and the best cigars in the universe.

**Wardrobe** - I enjoy being bare-chested. Like when working physically or when warm. So I'm going to go with that. I'd wear a Hawaii-style shirt otherwise, garish with palms and fishes drawn on it. And flip-flops.

**TARDIS** - Not a lot of changes, but gotta fit a kingsize bed in there. Was thinking I might need a TV, but then I have a TARDIS door that opens, so maybe no.

**Catchphrases** - &lt;when angry&gt; - ""YOU BLEEDING IMBECILE""

Trenzalore was meant to be his ending, and by his, I don't mean 11. I mean the Doctor's. He wasn't able to regenerate again, and he couldn't leave, so he was going to die of old age, or a Dalek would get lucky, or a Cyberman gets in somehow. But he's the Doctor and his biggest weakness when it comes to being caught and killed, is that of surprise. When he had a single, solitary place and time to defend, he would be able to be incredibly focused. His job wasn't to save all of space and time anymore - it was to save that town, in that time, until he no longer could.

So he lived on and on. Alone--surrounded by people, but still alone. His last companion, he'd sent away hundreds of years ago. The Doctor's time was up, he couldn't afford to be aggressive with the would-be invaders, because there was no regeneration to let him pop back up and keep fighting.

10 went everywhere as fast as he could, he took risks, he gambled, he saved the world over and over, but that also led him to die four years in. Throw him on Trenzalore and I think he'd lose his mind, he was too frenetic, even compared to 11.

That ""shitty little planet"" isn't any more ""shitty"" than Midnight was. Good episode, shit planet because we can't even see it.

And those 900 years alone changes the core of the Doctor. 12 is pretty uninfatuated with humans in general, these days, those 900 years alone really fucked with him. There are consequences, but your head is jammed so far up RTD's rectum that you can't even see it, because it doesn't lend itself toward your clear bias. 

Explain to me using actual arguments why him spending his remaining years on Trenzalore is ""cheesy."" Cheesy generally denotes some kind of inauthentic nature, but as I've illustrated, it was the last thing he was going to do with his life, which was limited to what time *that body* had left.

 [**Fourth wall**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth%20wall): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;The __fourth wall__ is the imaginary ""wall"" at the front of the stage in a traditional three-walled [box set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_set_(theatre\)) in a [proscenium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proscenium) [theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre), through which the audience sees the action in the world of the [play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre\)).   The idea of the fourth wall was made explicit by philosopher and critic [Denis Diderot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Diderot) and spread in [19th-century theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteenth-century_theatre) with the advent of theatrical [realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_(drama\)),  which extended the idea to the imaginary boundary between any fictional work and its audience.

&gt;Speaking directly to, otherwise acknowledging or doing something to the audience through a camera in a film or television program, or through this imaginary wall in a play, is referred to as ""breaking the fourth wall"" and is considered a technique of [metafiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metafiction), as it penetrates the boundaries normally set up by works of fiction.   This can also occur in literature and video games when a character acknowledges the reader or player.

&gt;The fourth wall should not be confused with the [aside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aside) or the [soliloquy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soliloquy), dramatic devices often used by playwrights where the character on stage is delivering an inner monologue, giving the audience insight into their thoughts.

The ""going rate"" that police use is Â£1,000-ish per plant when mentioned. So the guy who had a ""factory"" had seven-ish plants. ROI is about Â£650-Â£750 per plant but they use exactly the same technique to sell us the news. 

Only when the plants are in numbers of 100 or more do they mention the amount of plants. They literally never mention it otherwise. The lead of the ""press release"" the police give the media is always the amount of street value. Which I have to assume is highly inflated in multiple ways.

Reality doesn't sound as bad when it isn't deliberately hidden.

Anyway... off to make crisps in my kitchen, if by some chance making crisps become illegal and I'm caught... I only have a few big bags of potatoes, not a tayto factory and illegal crisps with a street value of Â£1,500.

There's 32 games left where essentially anything can happen. I think people get too lost in the numbers and assumed predictions that the final positions are set and match already. Football is an extremely funny game, big team's players get injured, lose vital games, etc, nothing is certain.

I know it's extremely annoying to see the team not perform too well and have injuries, but it's too early in the season to be all doom and gloom. Yes a string of wins would really get stuff kickstarted and I'm sure it'll eventually come, but realistically people gotta stop with the mass pessimism.

I always think back to Arsenal's 11/12 season where they sat at 15th by week 6 stumbling around in midtable for a bit, underperforming as all hell.

 AS MANY as a dozen schools in the east London borough of Tower Hamlets face investigation after claims they have fallen under the influence of Islamic fundamentalists.

According to government sources, officials at the Department for Education (DfE) are concerned that the situation may be worse than that uncovered in the âTrojan Horseâ scandal earlier this year, in which Islamic fundamentalists attempted to infiltrate secular schools in Birmingham. Emergency inspections of 21 schools in the city by the schools regulator Ofsted resulted in five schools being placed in special measures.

âTower Hamlets is expected to be the next Birmingham, but even worse, because the problems surrounding Muslim fundamentalists imposing their views on education seem to be more embedded,â said a senior Whitehall source.

Both secular state schools and private Islamic schools are under suspicion, and there are concerns that non-Muslim teachers are staying silent for fear of losing their jobs.

âThe DfE will rely on whistleblowers to come forward about non-Muslim teachers being sidelined by Muslim fundamentalists in the borough,â the source said. âBut potential whistleblowers fear they may be bullied, further sidelined or fired if they raise concerns.â

Allegations about the imposition of extreme views in Tower Hamlets classrooms come as Ofsted prepares to publish the findings of emergency inspections of 40 schools in England in the past fortnight.

In an interview with The Sunday Times, Sir Michael Wilshaw, the chief inspector of schools, warned: âThe problems in Birmingham are far from resolved.â

Ofsted has recently been into several schools in the city that were not subject to inspections during the Trojan Horse affair. Inspectors found that some schools placed in special measures have yet to overcome their problems.

Snap inspections have taken place in towns and cities across the country, including Bradford, Luton, London and Manchester. These involved faith schools with a Jewish, Christian or Islamic ethos, as well as secular schools with a high number of Muslim pupils.

Many visits were prompted by concerns that the schools were not offering a broad and balanced curriculum, including religious tolerance.

Marner Primary School in Tower Hamlets was one of those inspected after concerns were raised by the Home Office. Tower Hamlets council said it expected the school to be given a clean bill of health by Ofsted within days.

Next month Wilshaw will send the 40 reports, with a briefing note about the action required, to Nicky Morgan, the education secretary.

Officials are understood to be worried that, with Britain poised to launch airstrikes against Isis, the threat of children being radicalised was high. Wilshaw said he would not hesitate to act. âThere has never been a more important time for schools to promote the beliefs and values that underpin British society.â

âI can see us doing significantly more unannounced inspections . . . All head teachers have a great responsibility to ensure their schools are run properly and are safe for the children. If they are not doing that, we will inspect [them] without notice.â

Wilshaw is also in talks with the government about how to monitor madrasahs, private Islamic schools. These schools are unregulated and it is understood there is disagreement between the coalition partners on how to tackle the issue.

The prospect of a new Trojan Horse-style scandal in Tower Hamlets will alarm ministers. The original plot, first revealed by The Sunday Times, resulted in the removal of several head teachers and boards of governors in Birmingham.

A report into the scandal by Peter Clarke, a former head of counterterrorism at the Metropolitan police, found evidence of a âsustainedâ attempt to impose hardline Muslim views, with female staff bullied and Christian assemblies scrapped.

The DfE said: âIf any evidence of extremism is presented to us, we will investigate.â ",0,1411926077,null,0,false,0,ckutox6,t3_2hpaoe,t1_ckutox6,t3_2hpaoe,null,1426782522,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

I see little problem with copyright infringment while copyright laws reaming bias and unjust. Give me fair laws and treatment as a consumer and I would stauncly defend copyright. 

Why do you feel copyright infringment is important? Especially when weighed up against the right to privacy on the internet. If pushed most people will agree that some rights must be surrendered as part of the social contract. In this case protection from paedophiles, scam artists, terroists, etc. However most people aren't willing to give up their rights to, in many cases, line the pockets of already rich men.

Now I know the slippery slope argument is a fallacy, but I'm not trying to use it as proof that internet privacy is important. It is just something we need to keep in mind. The more rights people give up the more easy it becomes to take more away and use scare tactics to gain consent for draconic measures. Have you considered that the threat of terroists and peados, while a real threat to an extent, are the Red Terror of our day?  ""Won't somebody please think of the children"" is a classic way to legitimise state terror.

Now of course we aren't there yet, and hopefully it will never come to pass, but it is something we must remain vigliant for and discuss.

&gt;Something being worse than another thing doesn't make the second one fine.

Of course. As I said, I was being flippant so didn't really make it clear what my point was.

""Real life"" abuse exists and is a problem and often ends in physical abuse as well. Also internet abuse is often (but not always) just part of abuse in real life by school bullies, etc.

Now what I'm interested to know is if you feel that people should have their privacy closely infirnged upon in public too? You can't have it both ways. Either it is ok to infringe on privacy to protect people from bullying and abuse, in which case we should put cameras up everywhere (including all over schools) and give the government/police/Mi5/whatever the right to access them whenever they see fit with little to no accountability.

Or you agree that there is a line where it becomes ""too much"" and unreasonable. If you draw that line at the internet then you need to do a lot to explain why and prove that you are right. Otherwise you just come across as, at best, someone scared of the unknown or someone with a personal history that makes you sympathetic to anti-internet freedom movements (for example being a victim of online abuse yourself). I hope that isn't the case and you have a very strong argument (that is practical as well as ideological) which demonstrates why the internet is different to everything else.

I did no such thing.

&gt; We are not war-loving robots who can't wait to kill something and are baffled by the fact that someone might not feel the same way.

I take it that by ""we"" you mean Americans and yes I am an American and I am ashamed and horrified by the vulgarization and militarization of our culture by right wing extremist authoritarians. It is not in the least bit wrong or fallacious to make general observations about America or any other nation. **NO WHERE** did I claim that all Americans are violent and ignorant but a large majority of them are and our culture reflects this fact.

&gt; I would venture to guess that one big reason for us to be Doctor Who fans is precisely because violence is always off the table in favor of actually solving the problem. 

Yes, of course and that is why I like the Doctor Who series. As Colin Ferguson has said: *""It's all about the triumph of intellect and romance over brute force and cynicism.""*

&gt; 12 looked like he wanted to physically injure Danny. I can't think of any episodes where it's reached THAT level of instant hate.

I can. The Doctor has always displayed contempt for the military and militaristic solutions to problems.

&gt; To me, it's indicative of all the reasons I dislike this incarnation of the Doctor. He's mean and hateful and spiteful. He's insulting and just pretty horrible. 

Number six was vain and egotistical and yet he still fought against brutality and ignorance

&gt; But his behavior is so out of line with the character that it's leaving even long-term fans asking what the fuck is going on.

false,magicjavelin,null,null,"As a former Cambridge student, I can help more on the student aspect of whether it'd be worth it.

First, I'd make sure that the nature of the CompSci course is something you'd be happy with. I'm not entirely sure of the curriculum but in general Cambridge courses are much more interested in the background and logic of the knowledge rather than practical applications.

Second, as a non-EU student you'll be eligible for both the full tuition fee, a college fee, and then accommodation + service charge amount on top. As a UK student I never had to deal with the college fees, so I'm not sure whether that changes between colleges and whether there are ""cheap"" and ""expensive"" colleges.

Third, if you do decide to apply, be prepared to have to go to Cambridge for an interview typically in December of the year you apply. To add to the earlier comment about the academic requirements, you don't need fantastic results if you have an amazing interview , and from what I could make of the whole process the interview seemed to be the most important part of the whole admissions process. Also for CompSci you may need to arrange to do some special maths test called the STEP.

This is the negative/practical side of things. In terms of being a student in Cambridge I have to say it was fantastic. You get to work with people who are often leaders in their respective field and there are always opportunities to get involved in things both academically and outside the curriculum. I'd recommend anyone who may be in doubt about applying to always give it a go and accept the fact that the odds are that you won't get in.

Some people are on it for many years unfortunately. They require you to go to a 'job centre' every once in awhile and show you're trying to get work. It's a small amount of money, but people can (barely) get by on it without starving to death and becoming homeless.

Housing benefit is your rent paid if you have low income. Everyone on low income can get it, but some places restrict it to people in work only (even if they just work a few hours a week). It Also lasts as many years as you need it. You apply and they either give you part or all of your rent, in cash, into your bank account every every 2 weeks. Once in a while you have to prove you're still poor to continue getting it. 

People can also get child benefit. Basically, you get paid a little more for each one you pop out. I've never understood this one, but that's the way it is. I guess it's meant to keep kids out of poverty, but you can imagine what happens when people get paid to pop out kids they can't afford in the first place.

Also, there's an incapacity benefit for the disabled.

A lot of poor people have some combination of these benefits and that's their sole income.

They're making it more like the states here by slowly restricting these services, which people in the UK are pretty pissed off about, as it's always been this way here since WWII, and it's a solid safety net that really keeps people out of homelessness and starvation. People here don't want it to end up like America. But a lot of working people are also irritated that they work and get taxed to hell on their paychecks, which helps fund these programs for non-working people.

Why not just give you a FULL employed role (temporary) in that job, which gives more pay than JSA would...  
  
There's alot of people out there, especially youngsters who simply cannot get any kind of job. But when it comes to cleaning streets etc, these jobs suddenly become available positions for forced labour.  
  
Why is that? Because the council is now refusing to pay a living wage? They get around it by ""employing"" people who do work just to continue claiming their measily JSA.  
  
Why does government see ""picking up litter"" as some kind of punishment anyway? To be frank, if i could get paid to walk around the suburbs and clean up the environment, i'd be more than happy to do it. Maybe it reflects how they see lesser off people than themselves (silver spoons). The expenses claiming tyrant throws his Â£30 fast food meal into the car park and expects a teenager to be forced to clean up after them with no pay at all.  
  
This applies to anyone, all ages. My dad is in his 50's, and was made redundant a while back, when searching for jobs through the job center, companies rarerly (if not at all) got back to him as no ""poisitions were available"". However, as soon as the job center starts forcing threats on you for sanctions... you'll get an agency phone you up, and offer the same freaking jobs that were unavailable, but are now available, as if exclusive to an agency. Why do they do this? Because when you are ""employed"" through an agency, you have no rights, and the business involved uses loopholes to evade payments, such as holiday pay.

The ""anti-British"" thing is kind of immature on your part, I'm not entirely sure what you expect me to say? yes, the British empire has done a lot of nasty and disgusting shit before? Uh, there you go I guess? it just so happens that we did quite a lot of that a long time ago, where as if you live your life by a book written by nomads you've not really moved on much have you?

It just so happens that in a lot of religious doctrine there's a **lot** of cruelty. Or do you disagree with this?

Are you saying that during the process of halal, they do not say prayers? That to me is ""mumbo-jumbo"" yes, all prayers of any kind are mumbo-jumbo, and I think it's ridiculous to say them at any time, which also happens to include the time when you are slaughtering an animal.

90% is not 100%. I am displaying my disgust toward the fact that there is unnecessary suffering, I don't see a problem with saying that I think it's wrong. Traditionally there wouldn't be any stunning of the animal first, it only happens now because modern ethics states that they shouldn't suffer needlessly. Look, for some reason you seem to have a giant protruding nerve just ready to be hit by any passing criticism of either religion as a whole, or just Islam specifically and honestly? i don't give a fuck, living your life by an ancient book written by people who barely understood what was going on around them and taking instruction from an invisible being in the sky is ridiculous and I will mock it as freely as I wish.

I'm sorry that I see you as immature, that's not your fault of course, but I'm not going to stop criticising retarded beliefs just because it might offend you if you think I care? Halal says you cannot eat Pork...not ""you can decide not to""...it says ""**YOU CANNOT EAT PORK!**...that is ridiculous, the book is ridiculous, and that goes for any other kind of religious text which purports any kind of hidden truth just in case you get your little offended panties in a twist.

To sum up, if you are a Muslim or for some other reason really super-care about why I hate Halal?, I'm not sorry I offended you, you have every right to be offended and to respond, but it doesn't mean I have to give a shit, your beliefs (if you are the above) are primitive.",0,1411927985,null,0,false,0,ckuuoya,t3_2hp827,t1_ckuuoya,t1_ckusjll,null,1426782055,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

false,amaurosisfugax,null,null,"UK FY Doctor (Intern Equivalent) here. I always feel people underestimate how much medical culture varies among even the english speaking nations (although AU/NZ and UK are closer fits than US and UK).

Medical school here is quite different from in america. As others have mentioned it's typically a five year undergraduate degree (although most uni's allow you to take an extra year and get an intercalated degree). This basically means that your colleagues will be younger than you (I graduated MBBS BSc age 23), and the general medical school culture will also reflect that.

The general impression I have is that UK medical school is less intense and overtly competitive than in the US. Also US MS4s (at least on the internet) appear to have more clinical responsibilities than UK MS5s. The hours are less punishing over here as an indirect result of EU regulations over doctors working hours (Max 56hrs/week I think, and we have to explicitly agree to work over 48hrs/week to work that) that feeds through to the expected presence of students on wards.

As an international student you will be gouged by tuition fees, which will be between Â£20-Â£30k per year (some unis charge Â£20k for preclinical years and Â£30k for clinical years- check their websites) i.e. up to Â£150,000 (~$240,000) in tuition fees for your degree. This doesn't include your living expenses. I have no idea about what funding help you can get but I suspect if any, most of it will have to be arranged from US sources.

Also: you don't graduate MD in the UK. MD is a research doctorate in the UK while MBBS/MBBCh/MBChB is the professional degree that qualifies you to register with the GMC and practice medicine.

There is no USMLE equivalent for medical school qualification. Each university will award your degree based on your performance in its own examinations. The GMC inspects university curricula every few years to guarantee it is educating to the required standard and thus producing doctors with valid qualifications.

University ranking also matters less. League tables are available, but the ranking metrics they use don't really capture the major reasons to choose one university over another. It's better to choose your university based on your preference for educational style: Lecture based/PBL/Integrated, opportunities for intercalated studies (some unis let you do intercalated MSc/MRes and PhD) and whether or not the university's research strengths coincide with your interests (if you want to go the academic route) or simply just the character of the city or campus you'll have to spend then next five years in.

When you finish and apply for jobs in the UK, the application process doesn't discriminate based on university, instead looking at your relative academic performance compared to your peers at the same school and your score in a situational judgement test. This means that someone top of the med school ranked 30th in the UK will out-compete someone in the lowest performance decile of the ""best"" medschool.",0,1411928689,null,0,1411928932,0,ckuv29t,t3_2hnkgk,t1_ckuv29t,t3_2hnkgk,null,1426781871,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3

For example Britain banned the slave trade and did everythign they could to fight it but they were unable to wipe it out single handedly. It was still worth it. And of course Britain would have a lesser impact in this case but it would at the least be a symbolic victory and symbolic victories are definitely important.

Also they do something if, say, Britain decided not to extradite individuals to other countries, if the other country in question had broken Britain's laws regarding internet privacy to track the person down. Furthermore, other internet rights, not to do with privacy would make such a move have an even greater impact. Just as an example (not necessarily something I consider a good idea because that is another debate) the decriminalising of internet piracy would be pretty important.

And we agree that an Internationalist movement would be the best way to go about this then.

The main reason I find it hard to believe it's going on in the schools I went to is mainly due to the demographics of the teachers. Although the pupils I taught were almost all Muslim, almost every single teacher I worked with, or even saw, was white, and clearly not of Muslim faith. 

If anyone came in and tried to make the teachers that I've worked with follow a curriculum that was anything like suggested in this article, they'd tell you where to stick it, so I don't know what platform they'd have to launch this kind of thing from without overwhelming opposition.

____________________________________________

A Tory minister leading David Cameronâs drive for more women in politics exchanged X-rated photos with an undercover reporter posing as a female party activist.

Married dad-of-five Brooks Newmark, 56, who co-founded campaign group Women2Win, stepped down as Minister for Civil Society yesterday - and today admitted he had been ""a complete fool"".

The MP for Braintree, Essex swapped sexually explicit images and asked to meet the reporter, who was posing as a young Tory PR girl called Sophie while investigating the alleged inappropriate use of social media by MPs.

Newmark initiated a private message conversation online and, during Â­flirtatious chats and photo exchanges, sent a graphic snap exposing himself while wearing a pair of paisley pyjamas.

During a late-night chat with the undercover reporter, who had sent him an explicit picture supposedly of âSophieâ, Newmark asked for a more explicit picture âwithout your hands in the way and legs partedâ. He then said: âI will send you something in return â that way we each have a secret.â

The sleaze scandal will send shock waves through Downing Street as the Tories state their case for re-election at their party conference this week.

It heaps fresh embarrassment on the Prime Minister who faces accusations of sexism after failing to attract women to take up leading political positions.

The male reporter, a freelance Â­journalist who passed the information to the Sunday Mirror, was carrying out an undercover probe into claims by sources that MPs were using social media networks to meet women.

Posing as a âtwenty-something Tory PR girlâ called Sophie Wittams, he set up a Twitter account featuring a profile picture of an attractive blonde female and began following several MPs.

After posting a string of innocuous public tweets about tennis, Sophie was then followed by Newmark, who sent her a direct private message on July 6 saying: âGlad you appreciate my humour and how seriously I take my sport!â

He initiated a lighthearted chat about his âmundaneâ political tweets and asked her to follow him on Facebook.

Three days later Newmark invited Sophie to a Women2Win event and told her to âfeel free to drop by Parliament anytime for a chatâ.

He then said it would be easier for them to communicate over the phone via text messages and gave her his personal mobile number.

The pair continued to chat on the networking site Whatsapp where they initially discussed Sophie going on blind dates with other men.

On the evening of July 16, after Sophie told him she was lying in bed, Newmark wrote: âBy the way I have no idea what you look like so post a pic to me on Whatsapp so I know what you look like when I meet you.â

In reply to a picture Sophie sent after midnight, the balding MP sent a picture of himself sitting on his bed and wearing a white T-shirt.

He forwarded another of himself below the waist as he reclined on his bed watching television in a pair of dark blue and red paisley pyjamas.

Sophie wrote: âShould I send another pic that is the question.â Newmark replied: âWasnât that the deal?â

Sophie asked how far he was willing to go. He wrote: âThatâs very brave talk.âThe reporter then sent a more intimate image, supposedly of Sophie, and Newmark wrote back saying: âYou took my breath away!â

He then sent her a close-up of him with his hand covering his bare chest.

The pair discussed taking âit to the next levelâ before Sophie replied with an explicit naked picture and asked him to promise not to show anyone.

Newmark wrote: âYou must be kidding! Iâd never do that. But resend without your hand in the way and legs parted and I will send something in return. That way we both have a secret.â He added: âAssuming it meets my request and I reciprocate you MUST swear on a stack of Bibles you wonât show pics as I promise not to show pics of you? OK?â

The MP then sent a graphic image of himself to the reporter.

It comes as Westminster faces angry calls to crackdown on a culture of lechery and sexism in the wake of several sex scandals including accusations made against Lib Dem Lord Rennard by female party members.

Ministers are bound by a strict code of conduct requiring them to uphold âthe highest standards of proprietyâ. Two days after sending the explicit snap he sent another message saying: âI want a standing full body shot but you can cover up any modest bits you wish.â

The following day he messaged again, saying: âWhile you are clubbing think of me at a branch fish and chip supper in one of my villages! By the way itâs your turn tonite â so inspire me as per my instructions of last nite.â

The pair then continued to message each other about politics and a charity trip Newmark took to Rwanda, until the start of August. In a final Whatsapp message, the MP wrote: âHave made sure 6th and 7th are free in my diary.

""So Miss Sophie did one of your blind dates work out and have you abandoned all thoughts of meeting me for tea? Hasnât curiosity got the better of you. Come on weather is spectacular at the moment and Iâm certainly curious to meet you. And I promise I wonât bite!â

Yesterday while campaigning in Clacton, Essex, ahead of the October 9 by-election there, he sent a text to the reporter asking âSophieâ if she would like to meet him at this weekâs Conservative Party Conference, writing: âAfternoons fairly full with speaking engagements but around late evenings. Promise weâll meet up though. X.â

American-born Newmark, who has two homes including a Â£2.2million property in posh Belgravia in central London, regularly attends social events with his wife Lucy, with whom he has four sons and a daughter, and pal Boris Johnson. He has also been snapped at Tory functions with bigwigs including Baroness Thatcher.

He owns the investment firm Telesis Management. In 2009 his wealth was estimated at Â£3.2million. Political responsibilities include overseeing charities including the Girl Guides movement.

He has been an outspoken campaigner for female involvement in politics. On Friday, using his Twitter handle @tweetbrooks, the MP wrote: â67% of girls 11-21 think there arenât enough female MPs.â

He also posted a picture link to Girl Guiding campaign Girls Matter, which is calling for a guarantee that women will be represented equally in Parliament.

He sparked a furious row earlier this month when he said charities should stay out of politics and âstick to their knittingâ.

Elected MP for Braintree in 2005 he co-founded Women2Win with Baroness Jenkin, wife of Tory MP Bernard, that year.

The Tory conference kicks off with a W2W drinks party tonight, with guests including Home Secretary Theresa May, and Education Secretary Nicky Morgan.

Newmark was reportedly sacked as party whip last year after Chief Whip Patrick McLoughlin, lost patience with his tweets, which included one about whether to watch Downton Abbey or Spooks.

Mr Newmark reportedly said last night: âI am so sorry.â

But when first contacted with the allegations yesterday he denied ever having heard of Sophie. The Sunday Mirror then sent the allegations to Downing Street, which responded with a statement saying Newmark was stepping down and would be replaced by Rob Wilson as Minister for Civil Society.

Former Tory whip Michael Fabricant, referring to party colleague Mark Recklessâs switch to Ukip, yesterday tweeted: âWell, the good news is that Brooks Newmark will not be defecting to Ukip.â

Roast potatoes. To shut my uncle up I did them in olive oil; I was going to use the fat off some pork strips but he wasn't having it (no lard). They took forever and weren't quite as crisp as I'd like but had enough bite to them. Shoved some of the leftover garlic in. Tasty but not overpowering.

[Delia's parmesan parsnips](http://www.deliaonline.com/recipes/type-of-dish/party-food/accompaniment/parmesan-baked-parsnips.html). Cut them up quite small; gorgeous. 

[Carrots in OJ](http://allrecipes.co.uk/recipe/20818/glazed-orange-carrots.aspx). Had no brown sugar so used a spoon of honey instead. Very nice. 

Then peas, leeks, and brocolli (watery, the bloody things took an age to boil and I'd have preferred steamed but no steamer here).

Apparently the carrots could've been softer. Err, nope, if you're gonna make me eat those things them I'm not having them limp and soggy!

Similarly, 'psychoactive' suggests certain things to most people, but really without qualification it's a uselessly broad term that could mean anything from St. Johns wort  to Chlorpromazine.

The plants in question:

- Kola Nut : Contains caffeine.

- Betel Nut:  Betel *leaves* contain various moderately active catecholamines (which have essentially the same effect as caffeine) and are traditionally wrapped around Areca nuts (which are often mistakenly called Betel nuts), themselves containing arecoline which is a midly active stimulant closely related to nicotine.

- Raw Guarana: contains caffeine, at roughly twice the concentration per unit weight of arabica (coffee) beans, but not much else.

- Blue Lotus Tea: I can't immediately dismiss this one, for a couple of reasons. Firstly, there are various different concoctions bearing this name, each from a different type of flower. Moreoever, no one appears to have conducted a thorough pharmacological investigation of the likeliest candidates (Nymphaea caerulea being chief among them), so if we presume it's from some species of water lily native to the Near Eastern Mediterranean ('Ancient Egypt'), then it probably contains a small amount of caffeine and a slew of alkaloids. Note this vague description could also be applied to actual tea, chamomile tea, or any sort of herbal infusion. I can find nothing to suggest it has any more marked effect than those things.

We all acknoledge that this stuff is incompatible with modern western values. I feel that our 'western pluralism' has too long avoided the question of [what should be included in this pluralism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance).

Should we tolerate insular and inward-looking belief systems? This noble idea of pluralism doesn't quite work with several groups being the God's chosen people and branding others as sinners and kafirs.

I don't think there's any merit in defending 'moderate' Muslims (insert religion here), when what we mean by 'moderate' actually is 'secular', and when by 'secular' we mean 'non-religious'. 

When examined more closely, all these religious 'moderates' actually share a common idea of basic human solidarity and kindness. And when faced with moral quandaries, they either apply reason in conjuction with these basic ideas or turn to their religious texts and have ""doubts"" and ""trouble reconciliating things"" with the outdated and horrible advice they espouse.

English law does not need a penalty fee to be called a ""penalty"". If it looks like a penalty, smells like a penalty, then it is a penalty.

So.. I recommend you write a letter to the train company requesting a refund for the additional fare you were forced to purchase because this would be regarded in law as a penalty fare considering you already paid for your journey (and you have evidence to this effect). State that you will give them 14 days to resolve this or you will take this to the Small Claims Court (important you say this).

Two weeks later go online, submit a small claims form (which will cost around 20 quit give or take) stating you believe being forced to repurchase a return ticket was, in effect, a penalty fee and you have evidence you fully paid for that journey already.

Who has been played as a left winger when it's arguably not his best position, and has quality anyway - you want him off the field altogether"".. Fuck me mate, I'm in favour of dropping Gerrard and I can come with a hundred better arguments for Gerrard being in the team than that. His leadership, presence, passing outlet, calm head, passion, and tackling ability are good places to start if you need help.

 Everyone knows Gerrard is quality from dead ball situations, although not this season I hasten to add. It's his inability to keep up with play, to press, to track his runner, and his general poor play this season that has put his place in question. It's incredibly ignorant to use his free kick yesterday as justification to start him. I personally think he should be managed and played in the bigger games, with Allen playing the deeper role in his place as he did when he first came to the club. 

You've said Stevie isn't the only problem, so you can obviously at least see that he is *a* problem. Why not seek to improve this?

Cambridge is relatively a very safe city and you'll be fine most places. I preferred the Romsey region. The side roads off Mill Road in Romsey are where many young professionals choose to live. It is an easy cycle and probably 20-30 mins walk to town from the far end. 

On top of previous suggestions you could look for accommodation on the Brettward Accommodation Noticeboard http://www.brettward.co.uk/canb/ . Also just off Mill Road are many of the Olde World type pubs referred to by someone else in the thread.  The Kingston Arms and Cambridge Blue are personal favourites for good beer, although I've not eaten at either place recently so can't comment on food. I also love The Empress as that was my local. It's a bit 'spit and sawdust' but the clientele are a good mix, Dave (landlord) often has events on and there's even a pet pig named Romsey.

Totally agree with earlier comments that Cambridge centre is a nightmare for traffic, and parking will cost you a fortune. There is a good park and ride service with several sites that may allow a car commute most of the way should you choose to live in a surrounding village (although they've recently started charging for parking on top of the bus fare).

What I find amusing though, is the apprenticeship thing. So, after 6 months, they start working for free (free meaning they work for a benefit that others don't work for). The savings go into apprenticeship programs, so even more kids can work for free (or at least almost free). So what I get out of all this, is, under 21's will have a great amount of opportunities to work for free. 

I just... I don't understand the logic really. Wouldn't working for free like this just encourage them to go on full on benefits when they do reach 22? It would teach them that work doesn't pay, and after 3 years of working for free, I imagine they'd be quite disheartened about working at all. 

Anyways, as you stated, this is conditional on winning the next election. I'm sure even then it would be changed around a bit. So all this publicity is really just a bit of getting everyone riled up for no actual reason.

This system is more complex than most national governments, and because it takes place in Brussels is not covered by national media in as great a depth as national parliaments.

Fortunately Labour have taken over the Hammersmith and Fulham council and have promised to review all the developments the Conservatives approved. So that means the Earls Court development might be reviewed and scrapped so we might have a chance to bid for that again.

Then again the new plan might be to make adjustments prior to moving with a slightly reduced capacity and move back with a continued reduced capacity whilst work is ongoing. Only moving out to actually dig out the space I guess. Do a lot of the surrounding infrastructure first and then connect it all. But really that doesn't sound achievable.

I looked into the legislation covering ""stop and search"". You were presumably stopped and searched under the Terrorism Act 2000, of which Section 44 states:

-----------------------------

(2)An authorisation under this subsection authorises any constable in uniform to stop a pedestrian in an area or at a place specified in the authorisation and to searchâ

(a)the pedestrian;

(b)anything carried by him.

-------------------------------------------

(4)An authorisation may be givenâ
(a)where the specified area or place is the whole or part of a police area outside Northern Ireland other than one mentioned in paragraph (b) or (c), by a police officer for the area who is of at least the rank of assistant chief constable;

(b)where the specified area or place is the whole or part of the metropolitan police district, by a police officer for the district who is of at least the rank of commander of the metropolitan police;

---------------------------------------------------------

So firstly, you need to find out whether there was indeed a Metropolitan Police authorisation under Section 44 of the Terrorism Act in force at that time. An FOI will reveal that, although I would guess that it was due to the proximity to the 7/7 attacks.

We then move onto Section 45:

--------------------------------------------------------

(3) A constable exercising the power conferred by an authorisation may not require a person to remove any clothing in public except for headgear, footwear, an outer coat, a jacket or gloves.

(5)Whereâ

(a)a vehicle or pedestrian is stopped by virtue of section 44(1) or (2), and

(b)the driver of the vehicle or the pedestrian applies for a written statement that the vehicle was stopped, or that he was stopped, by virtue of section 44(1) or (2), the written statement shall be provided.

(6)An application under subsection (5) must be made within the period of 12 months beginning with the date on which the vehicle or pedestrian was stopped.

---------------------------------------------

So if you wanted written clarification, you would have had to have applied within a year of it happening, unfortunately. 

According to [this](Shortly after the 9/11 attacks, the Home Secretary and senior police officers established the practice of making rolling authorisations under section 44 to cover the whole of metropolitan London.), it was regular practice since 2001 to have rolling Section 44 authorisations for the entire of London, meaning police could stop and search anyone suspected of terrorist offences. 

However, in the ECHR in 2009, in *Gillan &amp; Quinton v United Kingdom*, the European Court ruled that the Section 44 powers were too open to abuse and should be reined in. The government issued a [remedial order](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/terrorism-act-2000-remedial-order-2011) in 2011 which amended the Terrorism Act so as to remove Section 44, so the police no longer have this power.

I haven't got time to do any more extensive reading than that but it's a start for you. It seems the police were within their right to search you but I would dispute their method of searching.

&gt;At the very least, it's something they should think about.

Actually, I think it's done on purpose. It's true part of it was disparaging, but there was a duel dynamic going on which was slightly complimentary. 

For example, unlike Mickey, Pink really stood up for himself in a grand way, plus he was very perceptive. In some ways he understood things about the Doctor that even Clara didn't. He saw things that even the Doctor didn't see in himself, like how the Doctor motivates companions like a commanding officer. And he just met the Doctor. 

He also saw that ""The Caretaker"" was up to something unusual. It's something that the other inhabitants of the school didn't seem to notice. 

I think the idea regarding how the Doctor sees something wrong with soldiers is really a reflection of something the Doctor doesn't like about himself. But this plot also has a duel meaning. Notice how all the soldiers are black. It might also mean that what the Doctor (and society) sees wrong with black people is really a reflection of something he (and society) doesn't like about himself/itself. 

We see the concept of projecting our own self loathing onto others in the Time Heist. The black female shapeshifter points out, 
&gt;""...Mutant gene, no one can touch me. If they do I transform. Touch me Doctor and you'll be looking at yourself... Would you trust someone who looked back out at you with your own eyes."" 

Also we see this reoccurring theme in how the bank owner kills her own clones and how the Doctor hates the person who planned the Time Heist.
&gt;""I know one thing about the architect, I hate him! He's overbearing, he's manipulative, likes to think that he's very clever....I hate him! Clara don't you see, I hate the architect."" 

The Doctor is the architect.

I think the reoccurring theme is revolving around the common metaphorical question regarding whether the glass is half empty or half full. When you see the glass as half empty, what you see has less to do with how empty the glass is, and more to do about the persona of the person perceiving the glass. In the same vein the problems that the Doctor has with soldiers (and black people) is his way of projecting his own personal fears and insecurities onto someone else. And in a broader sense, as the episode ""Listen"" shows us, the boogeyman that society sees under it's bed doesn't exist. It's something society has made up. We are our own boogeymen.  We are our own worst enemies.

That's an interesting point. However, we just relayed a brand new pitch this summer which cost us in the region of 500k, so I don't know if we will actually be digging it up again anytime soon. 2016/17, is a possibility for that I guess. 

But even still, I doubt we would be able to get it all done in time, as you've already mentioned. Worst case scenario we have to move to a stadium further away from Fulham road, because I can't see us playing at a reduced capacity.

I think to alleviate traffic problems around Twickenham, we might just ask for 40k capacity, which would be less than half of full capacity. Might be easier on the roads around the stadium etc.

In any case, I doubt we would be looking into it if it wasn't feasible. The only issue I'm concerned about is the cost, because it would cost us over Â£600m to expand SB to 60k. But since Roman is able to carry that amount as per FFP rules, I could see us doing it. But it is still a heck of a lot of money.

The doctor himself is pretty cool, like how he constantly makes quips against Clara and does his thing. He's definitely The Doctor alright, but the writing and villains are goddamn awful. Right now it seems to be more a story about Clara and her balancing of the doctor and her new boyfriend, whereas 11 was about the doctor and his companions, not the other way around like now. It is an interesting story though and Dan can be a very good character once he gets rid of this awkwardness. I'm interested to see where it's going, it's just not much Dr. Who right now.

The villains being awful doesn't help much in that respect. With 11 we had things like the Silence and the Weeping Angels which were a lot more creative other than ""killer robot about to kill the planet"". We've had 3 of those already in the last 6 episodes...

Clara herself seems to be coming along quite nicely now, but she kind of lost the cheekiness that made me really like her as the soufflÃ© girl. Back then I thought ""wow it'd be interesting if she were on the show more"", but right now not so much.

The idea of eidetic memory is that you can recall everything. Literally. What you had for breakfast on the 2nd June 1998. What you wore on 5 August 2012. If you had an eidetic memory I could ask you and you would remember it, hence why it is associated with extreme intelligence (which presumably is why you pointed out you can't do mathematical problems). The fact that you can't solve them would be a clear indicator you don't have an eidetic memory, because the idea is you are able to remember everything. The teacher can write notes on the board and you don't even have to copy them down, because you remember everything. 

Also I'm not a neuroscientist but I would suggest that most people store memories in short fragments. My earliest memory is a ""video"" as you say, of about 10 seconds long. And then I do just have snapshots of things as memories as well as short clips. That is, as far as I'm aware, completely normal.

I'm not saying you don't have a very good memory. But photographic it is not. ",0,1411938168,null,0,false,0,ckuzvps,t3_2hnuhq,t1_ckuzvps,t1_ckuu6yd,null,1426779623,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

you would think that he is mental, should be put away. 

if you think about it he has the same reason as you to believe what he believes: none. 

atmittedly, most religions have some kind of book which they base their beliefs on but what is it worth? there is no evidence that this book isn't just a big hoax made up by someone 2000-something years ago just to have a lever to control people. 

you believe the bible is god's true word because it says so in the bible, that man who rapes and muders the newborn believes he is god. what does he base his religion on? his own word. why? because he thinks he is god. how is that different from any other religion? 

""but"" you might say ""i don't go around murdering children!"" yes, you don't. because it's wrong. according to your religion you should. well, not all children, but those who are disobedient to their parents. 
&gt; If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them: Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard. And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear. -- Deuteronomy 21:18-21

you are christian but don't do that. you choose which orders to follow and which to disobey. you make your own phantasy world just to comfort yourself. believe has nothing to do with reality. never has believing that you had an a instead of an f changed that you failed your course. (or the other way around) 

&gt; Faith means making a virtue out of not thinking. It's nothing to brag about. And those who preach faith, and enable and elevate it are intellectual slaveholders, keeping mankind in a bondage to fantasy and nonsense that has spawned and justified so much lunacy and destruction.

false,GreasyPeanut,null,null,"Well I'm diagnosed with ADHD-PI and I had to go through the private system to get diagnosed since the NHS is a pain in the arse for things like that. The NHS started off as a dead end since I was forwarded onto whoever deals with autism, who turned me away since I don't have the autistic symptoms. I had to then go private to get tests done and all that and to get the referral forms for a prescription. So now I'm back on the NHS since my GP has sent a second referral form to CAHMS now that I'm on my prescription, the tests were positive and two psychiatrists think I have this. 

From what my GP has told me the whole system is lacking in funding. He says it's pretty much impossible to get diagnosed with anything if you're over 18 and that I'm lucky to even be considered for CAHMS since I don't have a co morbid disorder. 

This lack of funding is for a few reasons I think: 

- First off mental health is less visible. If you saw me standing about you wouldn't think there's anything wrong with me. Someone who is paralysed lets say is of course very visible. This means it's much more easy for people to empathise with someone with a physical disability than with a mental one. 

- There's still a stigma with mental health. Walk into work with a cast and say you've broken your arm no one will doubt you. Walk into work with medication and say you've been diagnosed with adhd/depression and people will tell you to wise up and that nothing's wrong with you. 

- And finally if people don't really empathise with or believe people with mental health problems then they don't really care about mental health. If the public don't care about something then neither will the politicians.  ",0,1411939510,null,0,false,0,ckv0jb4,t3_2hoyyv,t1_ckv0jb4,t3_2hoyyv,null,1426779318,3,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,3

Like any school it had its fair share of schoolboyish behaviour, but I would have given my eye teeth not to have to go to one of the other local comps, I would've died of fright I think. I got bullied and bossed around a bit, but not grievously so, and I never doubted that it would've been much more horrible elsewhere. And yes, there was fumbling and even shagging for the more confident boys, and spliffs and speed were experimented with but it was hardly a hotbed of promiscuity or an opium den.

I only have the benefit of one point of view, that of a public schoolboy, but my impression was always that we were broadly like *hoi polloi* schools but with less mindless behaviour and more imaginative trangressions than the secondary mod thickoes and the comprehensive middle classes, and that seemed a fair reflection of the fact that our school was extremely well-resourced and staffed, and attended by pupils who generally enjoyed slightly higher than average affluence.

Since then I've had public school friends, and have worked in a handful of private and public schools, and lots of state schools, and the bottom line is that the more privilege you throw at young minds, the more they tend to thrive on it, and it is reflected in their behaviour and intellect.

Basically I'm an older student who looks after first years, offers any and all kinds of advice, ensuring their move in is smooth, and organising events and such throughout the academic year, and so much more that I'm not going to bother writing it here. 

As such, I hear all about young young student's (many 17) first impressions of the city. For many it is their first time abroad alone, or even their first time on a plane! And of course, they come from every corner of the globe with varying levels of English proficiency. They are surprised by the friendliness and helpfulness of the locals and fellow students. Always. So that's good! 

Edinburgh is a very small and contained city, and is extremely easy to navigate, especially with technology as it is today. It's an outstandingly gorgeous city, and I have yet to meet a visitor here who isn't in awe of it. Hell, I'm still in awe of it. 

One of the other guys in this thread mentioned people from the uni who would be better to talk to than some random student online. Well, I'm one of those uni employed people! (But I'm still online unfortunately.)

I went to a public school, though I was from a working class background; my mum got a job (at a time when both parents working full time wasn't so common) so they could afford it and basically sacrificed everything in order to get me in. Boarded from the age of about 11 though I could have boarded from 8, and now I believe the school has a nursery to take kids even earlier. 

I was bullied from day one till the day I left. Part of that was my background, part of it was other things. Unlike a normal school where you can switch off at the end of the day, you're locked in with the same people day in day out. Tried switching to day schooling for a term but that just ostracised me more from my few friends so I stuck it out. Wanted to leave very early on but as it was clear my folks had sacrificed a lot to put me there I felt it would have let them down.

The stories about what goes on there are pretty much true, the rules are strict but everyone breaks them and there's sex, drugs, bullying etc. Officially you could get expelled for any of these... smoking would get you suspended. But the unofficial vibe was they'd turn a blind eye as long as you didn't put them in a position where they'd have to act and it'd cause them disrepute. Either that, or the staff were spectacularly clueless about what went on.

There were some very snobby kids there, but mostly what you'd expect from children of Tories who've drunk their parent's Kool-aid, really, nothing too egregious in most cases. You have to remember that not every private school is Eton, some of them are also-ran little places that exist in the public school anachronistic bubble, taking the kids of local businessmen and doctors and funneling them into unis. A few Hogwarts traits, but not top hat and tails. A few private schools are modern, forward-thinking schools that aren't up themselves, aren't pining for the 1920s and they tend to spit out the more well-adjusted kids.

Education, well. They come off well in the league tables (but not as well as they'd like, they're quite often out-performed by good state schools) but how much of that is down to the quality of education? Well, class sizes of 10-20 as opposed to 30-40 helps. Having a draconian system of discipline and mandatory attendance from locked-in kids helps. Having a shitload of resources the state doesn't have helps.

But, they also do a lot of streaming by ability. This means that the obviously Oxbridge bound kids get the best of it and are skimmed off from the majority of kids who often are on a different, easier syllabus so they still get good grades for the league tables. The less able kids and the disruptive ones are in their own stream so they don't slow down the rest, and they're bouncing in and out of detention until they move up a level or run out of time. Fees are money after all.

Am I glad I went there? Even all these years later I can't bring myself to say ""no"" because as people say it was a priviledge and I was lucky to get the chance to, and crying about it now makes me look ungrateful. My friends from home largely disowned me as a ""class traitor"" and I wasn't accepted by most people there either, so. My dad was so proud that I got in that I couldn't bear to tell him about the stuff that went on there, the abuse I got mental and yes on occasion sexual. He'd never forgive himself.

I've seen bright kids go into that place and come out happy and well-adjusted with great university places, go on to become famous. And I've seen people get the shit kicked out of them every day and come out of there broken human beings that can't relate to people and will never recover. On the whole, I think they're a relic of a bygone age and they ought to be shut down, they're a symbol of the entrenched inequality in our society and more than that, not a healthy place for kids to be. And while I absolutely agree that you look at the likes of the Bullingdon club and the snobbery and all of that in disgust - who wouldn't - having been in the system I feel sorry for a lot of the kids that go through these places and are damaged in ways they'll never know. They might have a bit of money to show for it at the end, but Jesus, the price some of these kids will have paid. It's not fun.

Austria 13,759

Belgium 14,467

Denmark 15,227

Some working out with TradingEconomics figures gave me a 1980 GDP per capita for Spain of 14,614.

So in 1980, the UK was definitely the poorest of Western European nations (i.e. ones that could join the EEC/EEA). North Sea oil and the finance boom in the 80s changed that.

We had so much help at School, it has a reputation for sending many students to Oxbridge every year and all of us applying to top Uni's and medicine were prepped with extra tuition from the start of AS level. I ended up getting rejected from Cambridge and going to Warwick. I was definitely punching above my weight, but I imagine though that if I went to a typical state school (like my state school educated best friend at uni-a fellow cambridge reject) I would have had barely any help as to picking which college or writing my statement or tuition for interview technique. Also having most of your teachers being Oxbridge educated or having phd's at top universities helps a great deal.

In terms of actually doing well in exams, personally I think I would have fared the same in a state school (like my sister) but the amount of help we got is priceless. And we still get that help in our old boys network and career events. 

I'm not sure if I'll send my children to private school, I imagine it would depend on where I settle down and what school's are available.

About the bullying I strongly disagree, it was extremely minimal in my school as were the hard drugs issue. Obviously that depends on what school you go to though. I have to add though that my parents are from a working class background and never felt the snobbery to be an issue at all, but yes you do encounter them more frequently.

Was it because they were against it in principle?   
Was it because they thought it took up too much parliamentary time at the expense of what they saw as more pressing issues?

I've been here since we had about 11k subscribers. As a sub grows, generally the quality of comments decreases. Now **normally** /r/uk is quite a good exception to this rule, there's usually a good strain of argument in the comments, the regulars are pretty nice etc, I like the flair based system. Unfortunately as subs grow you need hard moderation on internet forums, I've never seen anywhere where this is proven otherwise. The mods here for want of a better word are inconsistent. Sometimes they'll take down images, sometimes they won't, but the reasoning is at times specious. That's not a problems as normally the sub is quite self-moderating.

The problem usually comes around the 50k mark and has been noticeable since Thatcher died and the 'porn ban/NSA fiasco' last summer. You then get a lot of quite sensationalist stuff upvoted and a 'core' of people that can incite people here to a frenzy (e.g Tories are all baby eaters - even if you disagree with their policies that's not the case). Usually politics is the biggest touchstone on this issue because the userbase here are the ones most likely not to have voted for the majority party in the coalition government.

Added to that the sub follows all general internet laws of: 1.) Not reading articles posted and wading in with comments anyway and 2.) being hyperbolic. Some of the 'Trojan Horse' and Islamisation, along with young British jihadi fighters with ISIS has led to some people, many from /pol/ on 4chan but some here, whipping up a frenzy with regard to the current state of Islam. There was nothing like it here last year when Lee Rigby's murder happened.

This is the problem, though.  Prejudice and discrimination against LGBT people is rooted in the belief that there are two clear-cut genders with different roles in society, and that same-gender relationships are fundamentally different to opposite-gender relationships.  Having separate legal institutions to recognize same-gender and opposite-gender relationships encourages that belief.  Marriage also has a lot of social importance attached to it, which civil partnership doesn't because it is so new and unfamiliar.  I remember being really upset as a teenager when I realised that I wouldn't be able to get married, and the introduction of civil partnership didn't help at all, though I think I must have understood that it was legally very similar to marriage.

Unfortunately, civil partnership is legally distinct from marriage in quite a lot of ways, and the government (completely unnecessarily) decided to copy some of those features across to same-sex marriage, so things still aren't quite equal.  A few examples are that some older same-sex couples still don't have the same rights to pension survivor benefits as opposite-sex couples, opposite-sex marriage still has an archaic concept of consummation that has not been copied across to same-sex marriage, and government-employed chaplains have been given a special right to refuse to participate in same-sex marriages.",0,1411942929,null,0,false,0,ckv265s,t3_2hpc2u,t1_ckv265s,t1_ckuswus,null,1426778555,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I meet both Europeans and Americans regularly as part of my job, so I'm not coming from a position of ignorance here.

In world terms we are pretty similar to Europe, but we are closer to the Americans. It's not merely the proliferation of entertainment products over here, but we are literally two branches of the same culture. We have a common literary tradition, shared legal history, and the same language, for starters. Europeans might be friends, but they aren't family. 

The perception of who we are closer to comes down to politics, I've found. I admire America's aggressive brand of liberalism, but a lot of the left in Britain prefer the more socialistic stance of Europe, and so claim we are closer. I think the facts refute this, but I can see why on a personal level people might say we are closer to the continent.

&gt; The curator encourages the Doctor to go looking for Gallifrey before he leaves the Gallery.

In the closing scene, the Doctor describes a recurring dream, in which he and his eleven previous incarnations are looking together upon Gallifrey, which the Doctor vows to find and restore.

&gt;The Doctor concludes the Time Lords are using the crack and calling to him for help, from the pocket universe in which Gallifrey was trapped (""The Day of the Doctor"")

k so it was actually 'stuck' in the 50th and that episode is about them going to the 'stuck place' , and in the next episode Galifrey is calling out to them from that 'stuck' place. If they enter the Doctor's universe: war starts. Basically it ends with Galifrey doing its magic and leaving. I'll give that it is clear they should have the knowledge of which Universe to go to , and that they probably could go to it without ""hearing the doctors name"".
