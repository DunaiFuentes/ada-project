Why?

&gt; Tackling climate change faster your going to make the UK pay. Whilst China's and India evolving nations generate more pollution.

So it's ok to not bother being good as long as everyone else is being shit too?

&gt; More renewable energy that stuff is not cheap to make and set up.

Getting cheaper all the time. Unlike fossil fuels.

&gt; Wiping out the student loan book who picks up that bill.

All of us. Especially those who have more.

&gt; Affordable housing need space for them and realistically the amount we really need will take up a lot of the space those shiny solar and wind farms need.

There is plenty of space. There are thousands of unused homes. Wind farms don't take up much space that could be used for housing.

&gt; Scrap the welfare cap who going to pay for that.

See above.

&gt; Local government control over buses so pay more council tax to run them.

But cheaper fairs.

&gt; Scrap HS2 will billions already has been spent who picks up that bill.

What bill? You just said it's already been spent.

&gt; New local rail lines where are they going to go through the land reserved for the new affordable housing city's or the solar/wind farms.

No.

&gt; The living wage will be needed just to cover the increase in tax.

As for Tomkins and his rose-tinted, grandiloquent waffling, he makes some fine generic points, but I'm not sure about using the likes of Souness or Hansen.

People don't buy as many players from clubs like Luton or Home Farm anymore, because most of their players are shit, because most of the top players are already at a big club. Or their feeder club. With their gigantic, bloated squads.

Yeah, there are some still out there, but the days of us getting the next Aalan Hansen from Partick Thistle are less and less likely.

As for buying players from big, rival clubs, well that didn't happen because there was more of an even playing field when it came to those clubs, so if Liverpool didn't want to sell Ian Rush to Arsenal, they didn't have to.

We just signed Origi for 10 and it's clear from what Liverpool's finest journos have said that we wanted him for right now. If you look at the World Cup he had, he was clearly ready to come into the PL and play. Honestly, it'd have been better for him to be loaned within the PL anyway, but he would have been a MASSIVE upgrade on Borini both for this year and in terms of potential.

At the end of the day, someone of Borini's size has to have a certain type of nimbleness and poacher abilities to be even an above average PL striker. He has neither of those things. He's essentially a hard worker but not the fastest (not slow either) and not good at finishing. Daniel Sturridge played for one of the least creative teams assembled in history at Bolton and somehow he bagged goals. Because he's a goal getter. Borini isn't.

I'd obviously have loved Remy and he did represent serious money for value, but I'd just as easily take a number of others over Borini. 

I do not trust the kid. If he or Lambert ever are forced to start in the CL because Daniel Sturridge isn't available, I think my heart would be in my mouth from the opening whistle.

true,malone_m,null,null,"I have observed this debate for a long time and the people who bring in the persecution angle are the religious ones, this debate stems from a Human Rights perspective both in Europe and in the US (you can check the credentials of the people who started it), and they know how to shut a discussion down screaming words like ""antisemitism"" or ""islamophobia"" to bar any progress from happening. 

The goal is to protect children from having their genitals mutilated with knives by adults who are in a position to overpower them. If people hated these children because of their ""religion"" (even though they have none as newborns), they'd most likely be glad to see them suffer like this. When you fight against forced genital mutilation of children and they end up trying to portray you as evil ( especially when you're a victim of it yourself), you realize there is something seriously wrong with the way these people argue.

It can go further, see for instance all the mayoral candidates for the latest New York City election supported the oral suction practice of orthodox jews (metiztzah b'peh) even though several children have died from it and it very commonly transmits herpes, on top of being, literally, fellatio on a newborn.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/30/metzitzah-bpeh-blood-sucking-jewish-circumcision-ritual-debated-by-nyc-mayoral-candidates-video_n_3360526.html

Children's rights supersede religious beliefs ( this didn't bother many politicans when they banned FGM), and religious freedom must be viewed as an individual right, not something you get to inflict on others with a knife. Parents are custodians, not owners of their children.

I refuse the notion that there are ""benefits"" to circumcising healthy children, there are no benefits to violating basic HUman Rights and the negative effects, which most of the time only come to light later in life, are always overlooked. We don't see doctors preaching about the benefits of double mastectomies even though 1 in 8 women faces breast cancer over the course of her life. That's not how medicine works, we don't amputate body parts to prevent fictional diseases ( which is very inefficient if you see the STI rates in the US VS EUrope), plus the fact that it inevitably damages the child and bears a lot of complications, including death, should perhaps be taken into account before we dig into the benefits of a non-therapeutic  cosmetic surgery inflicted without the patient's consent.

...I agree with most of what you say, but I guess I take a more radical approach, the thought that one more soul has to suffer because of this lunacy is hard to bear for me, and I don't want to show more understanding to religious people who defend forced MGM because they spat in my face when I confronted them about what they did to me, and they also tried to shut down the recent debate on the subject at the Council of Europe. I know full well that politicians will not stand up and do the right thing by age restricting it anyway.

I remember games where Joe Allen came on to ""control the midfield"" and nearly all of them our possession numbers decreased. Never mind the fact that in saying you want him to do that, even if the myth is true it was only when we took off an attacking player. So really you could argue that it wasn't so much Allen but the introduction of another CM. 

When he and Lucas were playing together (with Gerrard) at the end of the season due to Hendo's suspension, they were both horrendous. I don't blame Lucas for that because he was being played out of position, but Allen will never be good enough to be a starter for me. And at his age I'm not sure it doesn't make sense to listen to offers.

If someone was willing to pay Borini's price for him, I'd take it in a heartbeat. I think we'd be able to sign a CM who was better right now or a young CM (from outside the PL) who had the potential to be better.

true,stop___grammar_time,silver,Silver,"* No, he doesn't usually meet them as children. 
* He died in the crash, the Sisters of Karn temporarily resurrected him for a few minutes. While he was temporarily alive, the Sisters could force a regeneration which would heal all the injuries from the crash. If he didn't, he would have died permanently. The Sisters could engineer a regeneration to result in a specific result - the Doctor chose a result that would reject his code of conduct and participate in the savagery of the Time War. Hence the freshly regenerated War Doctor saying ""Doctor no more."" at the end.

* ""Doctor"" isn't just a name, it's a code of conduct. That incarnation rejected the code of conduct and therefore the name, so yes, he is the 9th reincarnation of that Time Lord, but he doesn't call himself Doctor. 

* Let me give you an analogy to explain it as I understand it: Say he took up the name Jeff, and decided that he could only go by the name Jeff if he ate a pink grapefruit every week. First regeneration: Grapefruit. Second regeneration: Grapefruit. Third regeneration: Grapefruit. Fourth regeneration: Grapefruit. Fifth regeneration: Grapefruit. Sixth regeneration: Grapefruit. Seventh regeneration: Grapefruit. Eighth regeneration: Grapefruit. Ninth regeneration: **No grapefruit.** By his own rules, he can no longer call himself ""Jeff"" because being called ""Jeff"" requires him to act a certain way, but this regeneration doesn't. It's the same individual, but he doesn't go by ""Jeff"". Tenth regeneration: Grapefruit. Back to being Jeff. This guy's the 10th regeneration, but only the 9th one to call himself Jeff.  
The numbering's based on the number of incarnations of that individual that called themselves ""The Doctor"" because they abided by that code of conduct. The War Doctor did not call himself the Doctor because he didn't abide by the code. The meta-crisis Doctor, while calling himself Doctor and possibly abiding by the code, is a separate entity.

The NBA has seen 8 different champions in the last 31 years. MLB has a single team with more than a quarter of the championships in the entire past century.

And to be clear, my assertion re: the melodrama is mainly that ""homegrown"" has a clear footballing definition which you chose to ignore for the purpose of furthering your pount. Which I suppose is okay, but you also ignored what the definition actually means, which turned your assertions more into a diatribe maligning the paradigm shift of the introduction of power-players into the sport you love, as opposed to anything substantive and on-point.

*My* point is that the naïve fans are those that lament the fact that money will eventually (and already has) change(d) the game as if it is something that could be prevented. It is mere eventuality that 1) some owners will look for every edge they can get (like buying up young talent while it's cheap) and 2) some owners will treat their property (teams) like avenues to make money *more* than as sports teams whose sole purpose is to compete to win. Unless you as a fan have enough money to buy a club or franchise, you're only option is to watch and hope those in charge have enough devotion to your team to not ruin it for you.

I have said on multiple occasions that Chelsea needs to work more toward youth making it through to the top level of the club. But Lukaku and KDB both chose to go elsewhere rather than compete for their playing time. I wish they would've stuck around, but the culture is shifting such that young players are told sooner and sooner that they deserve playing time even if they're rough around the edges. If I have the choice between a star-studded débutante and a hard-working fellow who stays out of the papers, I'll take the latter every time. And the latest reports are that several of our academy products are actually trying to make the most of their opportunities. I am hoping that one or more of them actually sticks around for the long-term, and their approach and work ethic as is shown through media involvement with their progression is already far and away better than KDB or Romelu ever proved capable.

FFP is even being exposed as a joke. City and PSG aren't visibly slowed down by their penalties. ManU just shattered the book with their record kit deal. Real and Barca can and will buy whomever they want whenever they want, because they're essentially not even playing with real money. If anything, all FFP has done is preserved the status quo. Smaller teams cannot now spend to get better, because they cannot do so until they earn more. Which they cannot do without spending more on getting a better team.

All in all, I just hope Abramovich and Mourinho end up leaving Chelsea in a better situation than when they arrived, when their times are done. The course will shift with the times, but that should be expected, and as long as Chelsea are more competitive than we were when they arrived, we as fans only have so much influence and that ultimately has to be enough.

Robocar is traveling down a single carriage way at 40mph, the pavement on the left is crowded and traffic is flowing in the opposite direction.

Without warning a woman with a pram steps off the pavement and into the path of robocar.

For clarity, there is no time to stop.

So what does robocar do?

A. Run over the woman and child.
B. Mount the pavement and kill pedestrians
C. swerve into oncoming traffic and kill its passenger and those in the oncoming car.

A human would make a decision right or wrong in a heartbeat, but robocar must be programmed to do something, so what do you do? how do you value life?

3. I'm guessing they did that because the actors only signed for 5 years/5 seasons so they had to kill him to finish the show. It's so a major plot point and they were staying true to Classic Arthurian legend, Arthur is supposed to die and return later on when his people need him the most. 

4. The dragon was born long before he met merlin, he says earlier in the show that he has watched kingdoms crumble before because he's over a thousand years old

5. Yes merlin is still waiting for Arthur in the present day and Albion is the United Kingdom. In the show kilgharrah says Arthur will return ""when albions need is at it's greatest"". Before Arthur died he had already united the lands, so he's not waiting for them to be united.

true,OptioMkIX,null,null,"Suspension bridges with steel components are generally far more susceptible to damage than other bridges with rigid structural components like stone. 

Steel is [ductile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ductility), meaning it extends under tensile load, and is subject to [fatigue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_fatigue), [creep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creep_\(deformation\)) and [crack propagation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture_mechanics). It also, of course, rusts.

The largest part by far in a steel suspension bridge are the cables themselves, each made of hundreds of thousands of individual wire strands braided into larger wire ropes and these ropes are braided together into cables. 

These cables are in constant tension, so they are subject to all of the things I mentioned above. If an individual wire breaks as a result of one or all of these factors, that wire can no longer bear any load, which is transferred to the other wires in the cable. 

What this means is that over time, an ever increasing load is shared by an ever decreasing number of wires, resulting in a loss of strength in the bridge.

This is exactly what is happening to the[ Forth Road Bridge] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_Road_Bridge#Structural_issues) which is why they're spending a lot of money on refurbishing it and trying to mitigate the damage.

true,ringmaster_j,eng-GreaterLondon,Whitechapel,"&gt;Feminism is based on noble aims, but it's currently where facts, statistics and logical thought go to die.

I think that the need for feminism is heavily backed up by statistics on rape, forced marriage, domestic violence, career progression, wage discrimination and so on. Meanwhile, it's backed up by plenty of facts, such as the undeniable truth that it's almost unheard of to meet a woman who has not been yelled at in the street in a sexual manner.

Anyway, the question of whether or not you agree with feminism will ultimately be decided by your own ideologies and prejudices. It's not an empirical choice - few choices in politics are.


&gt;The Left are in denial about many of modern science's findings about human nature. 

""Human nature"" is, in and of itself, a construct shaped by own ideologies and prejudices. You can't just say that something empirically isn't in line with ""human nature"" without making a value judgement. It's certainly something to examine and think about - and has been since the dawn of philosophy - but it isn't something that science really has an opinion on. Most honest scientists would agree with this.


&gt;They celebrate 'diversity' by pretending that it doesn't exist and that every person is created with equal predispositions and talents, which is manifestly untrue.

Actually, one of the main left-wing fights of the past century has been to allow us to acknowledge our inherent differences (gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality etc.) without claiming that those differences necessarily make us better or worse than one another.

One hundred years ago this week, the world went to war partly on the basis on the widely accepted conclusions of the ""rational"" ""empirical"" ""scientific"" field of social Darwinism. At the time, it was accepted that certain peoples and civilisations were superior or inferior to others, and that it was scientifically inevitable (indeed, necessary) for states to go to war, lest natural selection not be allowed to take its course and eliminate the inferior parts of humanity. Most of us - on the right and the left - have learned from that.


&gt;And of course the communist Left were massively massively wrong in their theories about how to create better societies. 

One might argue that they took the more scientific approach - communism was very rationally thought out, and it was essentially seen as a giant experiment. The fact that it went terribly wrong does not rule out the fact that it was rooted in science. 

&gt;BTW - I'm left wing myself, but I hope I am not an ideologue.

Everyone wants to believe that they're taking the rational and scientific approach. Sorry, but you're just as much of an ideologue as everyone else -perhaps even more so. 

I know this will go down terribly on reddit, but here's the thing: when it comes to politics, being ""scientific"" is not always the same thing as being correct.

2. No. For a decent studio that's going to be nowhere near enough for somewhere in zones 1-2. You'd be better with somewhere further out. The question here is where exactly your new job is—it might be better to stay somewhere in a mid-point and then it's easy to get into London, and easy to get to work.
3. Gumtree is our Craigslist 'equivalent,' but you can usually also find reasonable deals on sites like Zoopla and Rightmove.
4. It depends on the unit. *Most* computers have power supplies that automatically switch between 110v and 240v power supplies, but not all. I believe a US PS4 should be fine *as long as* you change the power lead for a UK one. Household appliances like microwaves are less likely to do this as far as I know, so you would be better saving your removal bills and buying a cheap microwave/TV/etc. over here. (Also be aware: you need a TV licence if you want to watch live TV.)
5. Depends on where you are and how much you're willing to pay. Internet: £15-35 per month depending on how good the service is (the less per month the longer the minimum term usually is.) Cell: £10-35 per month depending on how much you use and whether you go on contract or have a pay-as-you-go SIM. Gym: no idea.

Especially when people say things like ""he would rather play first team football"" when its not like he'd be playing in our youth team ffs.

He also more often than not would have come off the bench in nearly EVERY game. And what if Costa gets injured? He would have probably had a longer run in the team as our number 1.

He hasn't been as bad as everyone might think. I'm one of the first to criticise him (Honestly check my post history) but its partially psychological IMO. You see him lose the ball and think back to all those Johnson is shit posts you saw online. You see Sturridge lose the ball and think back to all those great goals he's scored. We EXPECT him to do badly so we notice it more when it happens.

Equally all the bashing he receives has undoubtedly knocked his confidence. When he sees all the criticism people make and he gets in the press it undoubtedly effects him and you get into a bit of a cycle. Especially when your main strength is the fact he used to skip past people and create chances.

Statistically last season he wasn't that bad. Pass completion of 84% puts him up there with the best wing backs and ahead of many. Equally he created a chance per 90 minutes higher than Zabaletta, Azpila-whatever he's called and Gibbs.

One of his downfalls I feel was he took a shot almost every 110 minutes and yet he didn't score a single goal. That means almost every game Liverpool fans were watching him spoon one over the bar from a promising position time and time again thinking 'For god's sake Glen, get your shit together'

Defensively when he actually made a tackle more often than not he won it in fact yet again one of the highest duel success rates around at wingback but the number of tackles he made a game wasn't great. 

From this I'd say his positioning is off. Maybe it was never on. Strange with all his experience but perhaps he's struggling with the system, or from his injuries, perhaps he's lost some desire, perhaps he's not as fit as he was.

Whatever it is I believe that he's still decent although not a world beater. Is he worth the £100k+ a week we pay him?

I dunno.  Rolling out nuclear on a global scale would take capital and resources that I don't think we have.  Maybe it could've been done 40 years ago, but there's not as much spare energy now.  Energy per capita peaked in like the 70s I think.  It's not really a question of allowing ourselves to run out or not.  The economy would fall over well before that, since energy shortages spell no economic growth, which spells financial collapse, which means that capital and resources cannot be allocated to new large scale projects.  

I think people will die anyway.  We're far, far into overshoot territory.  I think lots of us will die, and I think soon.  I think there's a good chance that within my average lifetime human population will at least halve, through famine and disease, and I don't think that in the west we're immune to this.

true,harberton,null,null,"1. I used to do a reverse commute. I lived in Covent Garden and worked in Potters Bar, just outside London, maybe 12 miles or so. So I'd walk up to Kings Cross and get a fairly quiet train out to work (especially compared to the heaving trains arriving into Kings Cross). It still had quite a few people going up to Cambridge though. It's nice because it's not as busy. But many jobs pay more to make up for the much higher cost of living in London. Since your job is outside London, will your salary be enough to cover London living costs plus an expensive season ticket for the train?

2. Doing a reverse commute you need to be near a train station to get you to work. If you work in a town to the west of London, living in Islington would be a pain, for example. To live in the busy part of Islington (Upper Street area. I'm thinking Islington the place not Islington the borough) £800 isn't enough for a good studio. This is close, but it isn't especially nice, and it's £1150 a month http://www.zoopla.co.uk/to-rent/details/33961896. Unless you mean per person, where you could maybe get somewhere nice. You could live within walking distance to busy areas for a bit less.

3. Zoopla, Rightmove, and Gumtree.

4. We use 220v-240v. If your items are only for 110v they aren't going to work. But why would you bring a microwave from America anyway?

5. 

Internet probably around £30 per month.

Phone is anything from £10 upwards depending on if you just want a SIM or if you also want a contract phone, and what type of phone, and what tariff. EE have a Samsung Galaxy S5 for £20 upfront and then £37.99 for 24 months for 2GB of data plus unlimited texts and 1000 minutes.

Gym also varies from budget places like £18 a month for EasyGym in Wood Green, up to prices around the £100 mark for high end gyms in good locations like Gym Box. Prices will vary if you want peak or off peak membership and if you want to be able to use other gyms the company owns besides the actual one you joined.

Train: If your commuting out of London you're going to need a season ticket from the train company that runs the route. Southeastern, South West Trains, First Capital Connect, East Midlands Trains, First Great Western, Southern, Chiltern Trains and c2c all have their own prices. 

To demonstrate some examples: Welwyn Garden City is exactly 20 miles from London and a yearly ticket is £2684 on First Capital Connect. Reigate is 19 miles from London and is £2612 and Shenfield is £2800. 

So you're looking at up to £3000 per year for an annual commute. Your season ticket for this however doesn't necessarily cover you for travel within London. You might be able to buy on add-on onto your ticket. If not a zones 1 and 2 oyster card is £1256 for a year.

Considering his age too, he's just more of a liability than an asset. Between Flanagan and Kelly, we can at least cover the position if Glen sucks, but it would be better to replace him now since we aren't offering him a contract. So many of the games we struggled in were because teams would play us narrow and just let the FBs sit with the ball. 

Its a glaring weakness. Teams are going to target him every week because he's the one player that can't make cutting passes or press. He's a 100k/week outlet that is often out of position.

I'd appreciate if he were truly a bad defender or ""past it"" that he could at least Downing his way through a game - be clueless but at least committed.

I'm no expert on body language but it's not hard to read that something is up and whatever it is, and however much it mitigates his poor form, he's not going to help us win a title unless something drastically changes. And at 30, I don't think we should be waiting.

Sadly, this is all aside from the reality that we're not going to move him on unless Redknapp wants him and is willing to pay his (now) silly wages.

p.s. I spent about 30 minutes just watching him live at the World Cup (mainly because England were doing piss all against Uruguay so I figured I'd watch him like a scout would) and he really is painful to watch when you can follow ALL his movements. I think the two things he's lost most (aside from toss-giving) are his anticipation and his decision-making in terms of runs.

The onus is on those making the claims.  What I'm pointing out is that the existence of a problem does not imply that any given solution is correct or appropriate.

BTW - although I've never managed to track down the UK stats, the American stats show that rape has undergone a massive decline in the past few decades.  Not that you'd be aware of that talking to feminists.  Far from living in a rape culture, we're probably living in societies in which women are safer than they have ever been at any point in history.


&gt;This is an ideological statement, plain and simple. 
[referring to my statement ""we're not blank slates to be molded by culture.""]


No it's not.  It's based on reading Steven Pinker's erudite and fascinating [repudiation of the blank slate myth](http://www.amazon.com/The-Blank-Slate-Modern-Denial/dp/0142003344), which corals a tonne of evidence from psychology, philosophy and biology to show that humans cannot be blank slates.  Pinker is a very well respected scientist.  Feel free to disagree with him, but I thought the point we were discussing is how some people choose to reject science when it conflicts with their ideology.

Looking at [a survey of Londoners](http://engage.barnet.gov.uk/consultation-team/residents-perception-survey-2013/user_uploads/residents--perception-survey-report-qtr-2-3-2013-14-final.pdf) which is just what Google gave me first, 75% of people think their borough council ""is doing a good job"" either ""a great deal"" or ""to some extent"", and 73% say their borough council ""is making the area a better place to live"" (page 42).

I don't think you'd get many councils that lose between one third and half of their seats after one term, which is what those polls predict.

I expect a depot is needed, with engineers and vehicles to collect broken down cars, but buses and trains have these costs as well. With enough vehicles you could even deploy replacement cars automatically, and perhaps have cars town broken down cars back to the depot.

The example I keep using just because it's most recent was the Schneiderlin/Rodriguez move.  Two nights ago everybody had stories up at very similar times that said the move was nearly done.  That includes the BBC, which I normally take *very* seriously - if they say a move is close, it's close.  So then I looked at the Telegraph.  Their headline was ""Schneiderlin wants Spurs move.""  The story said that he was eager to rejoin Pochettino and Levy was confident a compromise fee could be agreed for him and Rodriguez.  That to me is a totally different story, a more measured one, and one that inclined me much less to say ""oh shit they're actually coming.""

It's also, as I think subsequent evidence has shown, much closer to actually being true.  Schneiderlin wants the move, and Levy wants to get it done.

true,ProtoKun7,smith,Smith,"&gt; Yes I remember that, but there was a totally different story when Matt/11 or one of them had a flashback to when he first stole the Tardis, and was in a desert-looking area, wondering what to do (it was sorta very humourous!). It was one of the first episodes I ever watched and I've recently seen it again, so I'd *guess* S7. The Doctor wasn't sure what he *should* be doing, or what he was doing (dang I *really* think it was Matt S playing the role!!), and he stepped in some *frame* and was hanging around, then **Rose** freaking popped up and asked all these questions, and she turned out to be the heart of the Tardis or something and that's how ""he got the power"" or the know-how to use the Tardis.


I think you're thinking of *The Day of the Doctor* (50th anniversary special), which was the next story after series 7. There was a clip of the First Doctor (William Hartnell) and Susan (his granddaughter) taking the TARDIS. Later on, the Moment (a Time Lord weapon) took on the form of Bad Wolf, which is why it looked like Rose.

&gt; &gt; ...eh? Matt's the Eleventh Doctor and he was buried in Trenzalore, but the Time Lords changed the timeline and gave him a new regeneration cycle.
&gt; 
&gt; Lost again! LOL! Okay so wait: when they regenerate, is ...*something left behind?* Or is it like how *a version* of the Doctor (like 10) can break out into another universe and hook up with Rose? —sad episode, but I can't recall the name of it. LOVED it, but I completely didn't understand it. To save DVR space, I delete Who episodes after I've watched them more than once, unless I LOVE them (last three episodes!) or unless I'm not sure I understand them (last three episodes, too, lol!) But I have like, okay over 50 episodes so I can't easily find it. It had two 10s I think, and one crossed over to stay with Rose in that other universe, but the other 10 didn't. **What is that episode?** (I'd like to watch it again! ASAP!) Anyway, is THAT how 11 is buried on Tranzadore, or is it that a future no-more-regenerations Doctor still gets buried there. (*Sorry; like I said, I'm really green at this. I never thought about a regeneration leaving* something behind, like a snakeskin.)

Nothing is left behind after a regeneration; it's a complete change. There was a metacrisis in *Journey's End* (series 4, episode 13), in which the Doctor stopped a regeneration from completing and diverted the energy into his hand that had been cut off in his first story (*The Christmas Invasion*, 2005 Christmas special between series 1 and 2). This allowed another version to grow, and this version joined Rose on the parallel Earth.

The version of the Doctor that was apparently buried at Trenzalore was the real Doctor, after he had finished his regeneration cycle. Seemingly this has been negated by Gallifrey's intervention.

Not to worry, I have the episodes as well as an almost encyclopaedic recollection of them.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Have River and the Doctor ever *hooked up? If so... when? No, no: why? I see chemistry there, and they're cute and all, but if they know what they know... is she planning on outsmarting (or did she already outsmart) whoever kidnapped her?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; They're married and he took her on dates during her nights in Stormcage. What do you think?
&gt; 
&gt; Um... I'm thinking I missed a HUGE episode :( Of the listed ones on the internet, I've never seen ""Voyage of the Damned"" and ""Christmas Carol""... might it have been in one of those?! Or is it a webisode? Or watching out of order as I did, I may have just not made an important connection. I'll look up a list of ""River episodes""... well, it's good to know they DID IT! OOOH YEAH GO DOCTOR!

River doesn't appear in either of those. I listed River episodes in chronological order a few months ago, which you can view [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1uwbmy/to_watch_river_song_chronologically_from_her/cemb5td) which might help if you want to make sense of her story.

&gt; 
&gt; Brings up another question: so 10 apparently loved Rose in a romantic way for real, then, but never hooked up with her in his own timeline; 11 hooked up with and married River (I do remember their wedding; brought tears!). **Does that mean 12 will have nothing to do with River? :(**

River's story seems mostly done now; I don't know if she'll ever turn up again, but it's not impossible.

true,alexgmcm,eng-sussex,Sussex,"Well ITER is expected to be working by 2020 IIRC and I think we will have DEMO (an experimental actual reactor, i.e. it produces electricity and isn't just an experiment to control fusion) by 2030.

I personally think they might switch to using a stellarator design for DEMO instead of a tokamak as we no longer need the plasma current due to massive progress in neutral beam injection for plasma heating. Removing the plasma current will remove a large source of instabilities. 

But the stellarators have a number of engineering challenges - the Germans will show us if they can be addressed with the Wendelstein 7-x machine. That should be finished on a similar timescale to ITER.

I am optimistic we will have a working commercial device feeding into the grid by 2050. What I strongly suspect will happen is that China or somewhere will get it first as they have built tokamaks really quite quickly (and the Koreans too) and once the potential is realised I think it will start a 'scramble for fusion'.

I think the problem is that we have to place climate change policies within the economic reality - we don't have an alternative currently to fossil fuels and so simply imposing punitive measures will make everyone's lives more miserable and probably disproportionately effect the most vulnerable in our society. These are real concerns and I think ['Sustainable Energy: Without the Hot Air'](http://www.withouthotair.com/) by David MacKay is the best book I've read on the topic (he is also a pioneer in machine learning, a truly remarkable man!).

The support of the NIMBY's is what really irritates me about the Tories though - although I don't think we will be free of fossil fuels until we get something like fusion or some other breakthrough technology (perhaps solar?) we can still build more windfarms etc. and blocking the construction simply to keep house prices high and the 'True Blue' Brigade happy is against the public interest.

Well your taking on a whole new load of public sector workers who will want paying and pensions and running the rollingstock isn't going to be cheap.
&gt;So it's ok to not bother being good as long as everyone else is being shit too?
Bit like the smoking in public places ban great in the pub shit when you walk outside and get a lungful of cancer from 20 shivering smokers done our bit but not solved the problem just prolonged.
&gt;All of us. Especially those who have more.
So my crap education and hard work to keep my family alive and out of the benefit zone gets taxed even more to pay for a stranger to get a freebie whats my return on that.
&gt;There is plenty of space. There are thousands of unused homes. Wind farms don't take up much space that could be used for housing.
Unused privately owned homes or council house's that require money to bring them up to standard or not in the right place. Do we only need 100 or 200 wind turbines to keep the grid running 24/7 or are we talking 10's of thousands.  Don't forget we need space for all our farm animals since factory farming is being banned by the greens or is meat free Monday in Brighton going to change to meat free nation every day.
&gt;See above.
what because you live in a house you have a job.
&gt;But cheaper fairs.
councils already subsidies bus fares with the contractor. But hey more public servants more pubic servant pensions we will be quids in on top of fleet running costs.
&gt;What bill? You just said it's already been spent.
we have not paid the full cost and the money was going to be recovered in revenue raised from rail fares and im sure the unions will have a say when you scrap all those jobs building it
&gt;No.
to get from town to village you have to go through open space where your going to mount your windfarms and solar farms and grazing space.
&gt;Source?
Common sense due to the increase of funding students, train and bus drivers rolling stock costs and affordable housing cant rely on business paying their taxes on time from their Irish and Luxembourg tax havens. And lets not forget free range is always the cheapest in the supermarket but hey those on uncapped benefits will be able to afford it.  Buying back all those outsourced Government departments the people who work in them become public workers again. 
&gt;Have you got a source for any Green MEPs/MP's/Councillors voting or making decisions in ways they said they wouldn't?

If you work to pay your rent then it doesn't affect you.  Rent isn't increase, benefit paid is decreasing.

The problem is  - the number of people who are being forced to move to smaller properties, vastly outnumber the available properties.

My friend is a good example.  He has a two bedroom flat, the 'spare' bedroom is used by his two sons when they visit at the weekend.

The company he worked for went into bankruptcy so now he is on Jobseekers allowance which is is £72.40 per week.  

He's been told that his sons using the other room isn't a valid use so has to pay the bedroom tax.  £72.40 -£14 leaves him with £61.40/week to live on.  That's to pay bills, food, travel to interviews, feed his kids on a weekend and he also has to still pay child support of £15/week.

No way is that fair.

Or you could look at my own situation.

I live in a 2 bedroom flat and get ESA disability.  My 'spare' room is used to store my oxygen tanks &amp; mobility scooter.  My use of the 'spare' room has also been deemed ineligible, despite the fact that there is nowhere else in the flat I can keep 3 full size tanks and a scooter.  The extra money I get for being classed as unable to work is now taken by the bedroom tax.  It most certainly is a deduction in benefits - one govt dept is taking from what another govt dept decided I needed to live on.

true,Phil_Ken_Sebben_Haha,null,null,"Yes, you understand it. I know its naive and idealistic to think it could have been different. Everything evolves, but to be content with the path, to accept it, that is another matter. you can be aware of it and accept it or you can say ""No"". I know my only option then, if I am not a hypocrite, is just to stop watching football. But it would be futile, because those mechanics are found in everyday life. I can only end up with the contradiction... I wish I could make myself more understandable, but I am talking, writing actually, in a foreign language, and it can be quite difficult to portray your opinions in a proper political, sociological correct way when you are at the same time searching for the right words. 

Still, I don't agree about your point that it's not substantive what I was saying about ""homegrown"" players and the link between players who are loaned out. The word homegrown itself, well, not everything has to be limited by the definition of a word, and for me it's the wrong definition. If you can't grasp why I feel that way, if you can't understand that, after what I wrote, then we surely have very different views on this subject. 

I saw a documentary about NBA, I don't watch it, I can't, I have to work in the day, and they play at night, and there they had some kind of equal sharing model. Everyone has their income and that's put in a pot, just roughly speaking, en then equally divided under the different clubs. I have to ask, if you say it was a bad example, because for me in theory, it seemed like a revolutionary idea to use. What is wrong with it that they still can't manage to make the NBA more competitive? Because we can talk about how exciting the BPL is ( not much different champions though), European competitions are a big joke, and Germany and Spain are a two horse race with sometimes an exception.

All that being said I think that many people rave because of the trust in Rodgers. In the last TAW with Carra they talked about how Rodgers claimed to have loved Borini for his fight and his spirit and I'm sure he thinks he's a great lad and wants to give him a chance to kick on. Rodgers has been picking mentality and personality as much as he's been looking for proven quality. 

Borini might even stay as kind of a wide striker to replace what was going to be Remy. Obviously I'd have Remy over Borini any day, but I trust that Rodgers will keep who he thinks will add to the team and will give Fabio a change *if* he proves himself in the preseason. (which he hasn't really so far but maybe he'll find some partnership that can warrant us keeping him as a squad player). 

What does everyone think about January? Could one option be to keep him until then and  hope he brings enough to keep clubs like Sunderland in the market for him, and then offload and replace him in that window? (I still hope the Sunderland move goes through now just so we dont have to chop in change in an important position like that midway through the season)  ",0,1406742877,null,0,1406743079,0,cjc6vpq,t3_2c4srl,t1_cjc6vpq,t1_cjbxjqg,null,1434977038,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

If the postwoman can deliver a special delivery correctly she can deliver the rest of it correctly. So clearly this can't be simply be her ineptitude, especially if you've spoken to her about it as you say.

Are the streets similar names? Is it a 'normal' street (i.e. not miles long, with loads of dodgy numbering systems or house names rather than numbers)? Are the postcodes similar? Is your house a recent build? Are the two streets 'intertwined'. I can't properly explain this but it's common where I work and it is very confusing.

I'm a postman and on my round a new house was built a few years ago. I won't use the real numbers, but basically this road is miles long. The houses are all big and quite spaced out. This new house that got built was built in next to number 63. The next house along doesn't have a number, just a name. The new occupants of the new house named it number 24. It should be numbered 65 or have a name, and this is what shows on our sorting frames. 

There already is a number 24. And it's over 100 years old. It's on the other side of the road about a mile away. So if a postman who doesn't know the round/doesn't recognise the names, all the mail meant for number 65 goes to number 24. So they fucked up and it's entirely their fault because you can't choose a number for your house at random.


Why have these other people just been stockpiling your post? Why haven't they either been putting it back in a postbox having written 'Delivered to wrong address' on it, or simply returning it to sender? Why haven't they asked their postman or complained through customer services? Why haven't they stuck a sign on the door saying 'This is NOT 22 Reddit Street' for example?

There seems to be much more to this. But in the immediate term you should be telling these other people to stick a sign on their door.",0,1406742924,null,0,1406743216,0,cjc6wpn,t3_2c5q66,t1_cjc6wpn,t3_2c5q66,null,1434977049,8,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,8

This surprises me. He's an excellent, creative midfielder comfortable on the wing or inside and is still only 29. £7m seems like a steal for him. I know we already have Markovic, Sterling, Coutinho, Lallana, Ibe, Suso, Teixeira and (possibly) Borini who are all capable of playing the same positions as Valbuena. However, I would expect Ibe and Teixeira to be loaned out and Borini to be sold. Lallana is also currently injured. Adding Valbuena could be a shrewd move. Probably an unpopular opinion which will be downvoted to oblivion. 

If we don't add any further attacking mids/wingers I would like to see young Teixeira get his chance this season. He impressed me in the youth team and the 1st XI last season and has looked good in early pre-season. Both he and Suso should be given ample opportunity to prove their worth.

I'm surprised that, as a student nurse, this is what you think. The nature of a reservoir, as an arbovirus, is not entirely clear for ebola, but human to human spread has clearly been identified and studied before, and is:

 * Direct contact with blood or bodily secretions of an infected person.

 * Contact with objects such as needles of blood belonging to an infected person.

With proper use of body protection such as gloves, gowns, etc, as well as disposal methods of contaminated objects, the risk of transmission is greatly reduced.

It's all about getting the biggest edge possible, and every sport eventually becomes that way. My point was merely that they were clearly talking about the football definition of the term, and you changed the entire conversation to be about you thinking the definition was bad. You're opinion wasn't necessarily *wrong*, just misplaced or off-topic, in my opinion.

The only point to be made with American sports is that, for those that added salary caps or other such means of limiting expenditures, ultimately the same teams as before the caps seem to come back around and compete for the championships, whether due to prestige, better management, shrewder tactics, or what have you. In my opinion, using American sports as an example, the only way to really even out competition is to set salary caps of teams *much* lower. Take a league average of salary expenditures and force all clubs below that. But the majority of teams (as well as all player's unions) would fight that idea tooth-and-nail, precisely because it is adversely affecting the free-market aspect you discussed before.

The sharing model you are talking about is essentially that, for every dollar spent over a salary cap, that team must place penalties into a pot that is then split amongst the teams that did not go over. But that does not even necessarily work as expected, because the teams that did not go over are essentially only seeing nominal benefit from the contribution,  while the offending team is still competing for championships, which is likely worth more to them than the penalty paid.",0,1406744030,null,0,false,0,cjc7jqg,t3_2c1qsi,t1_cjc7jqg,t1_cjc6v3g,null,1434977351,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

Also I never understood this mentality. I want and expect Liverpool to compete for everything. If you look at as a big picture it seems like a mammoth of a task. However, like we did last season we can only take it a game at a time. We are certainly capable of beating any team in the PL. 

Where's the fun in supporting your team in hopes that it gets enough points to make top 4? Don't give me ""I'm just being realistic arguments either"". Realism means nothing in football. Realistically we weren't meant to take City to the last game of the season to win the title. Realistically we were never winning CL in 2005. What makes football great is how unpredictable it can be and the best team/squad does not always win what they're supposed to.

As Gerrard said in his recent interviews, the boys are looking to challenge for every silverware and we, as supporters, should be there every match helping them on. We can recreate what we had last season. When fans started saying, go on then, we can fucking do this last season you could see the drive it gave our players. 

Realism shouldn't have any place in LFC if you ask me. That's not what being a fan is about.

Type | Amount
---|---
Basic Pay | £1375
Tax | £-108.33
NI | £-85.44
Take home | £1,181.23

If this is your first income this tax year, you may either pay less in tax or get a some back at the end of the year. I think it'll total about £500.

This is because there are 9 months left in the financial year, and your allowance is £10k. You'll earn £12205 in 9 months (this month £1205, £1375 each other month). That means you should pay tax on £2205, not £6500. 20% of £2205 is £441, without any adjustment you'd be paying £(108 * 8 + 74) = £938 so you should be entitled to £500 between now and april.

This may be achieved by taking less tax from your paycheque or getting an automatic refund at the end of the year.

&gt;The 'Jews' don't have the Iron Dome. 

LOL, Pro-Hamas Arabic language descriptions of this conflict routinely use the word ""Jew"" interchangeably with Israel so it is kind of funny it upset you if I do it too. 

Hamas Charter:  http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hamas.asp

**Israel** will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it. 

This Covenant of the Islamic Resistance Movement (HAMAS), clarifies its picture, reveals its identity, outlines its stand, explains its aims, speaks about its hopes, and calls for its support, adoption and joining its ranks. Our struggle against the **Jews** is very great and very serious. It needs all sincere efforts. It is a step that inevitably should be followed by other steps. The Movement is but one squadron that should be supported by more and more squadrons from this vast Arab and Islamic world, **until the enemy is vanquished and Allah's victory is realized.**


------------------------------------------------------------------------



&gt; End the blockade.

Not a chance. The blockade is totally legal according to the UN Secretary General's Palmer Commission.

The blocade is on military weapons only. Without it Iran would have a long time ago placed thousand of heavy warhead ground to ground missiles in bomb-proof silos in Gaza and turned Gaza into a heavily fortified bombproof base of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, as they have done in Southern Lebanon.

While the fascist warmongering Hamas dictatorship is still in power the Blockade will stay for a 1000 years.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------


&gt; If you drop a bomb or pull a trigger. You are responsible for your actions.

False, Self Defense is a guaranteed right to all nations in the UN Charter. 

Hamas chose to declare war on Israel the moment it seized power in 2006, Hamas chose to invest hundreds of millions of dollars intended as aid for the poor into military fortifications and rockets whose only military purpose is to terrorize the Israeli civilian population. 

And why? For only one reason. Because they are an Islamist Jihadi organization that considers all of historic Palestine to be sacred Muslim land that no Jew can ever be allowed to rule since this offends the Koran, Islam and is a sin directly against Allah.

Hamas has also chosen to fight urban warfare from behind women and children used as shields., in homes, schools and hospitals, hoping to draw civilian casualties in a cynical attempt to manipulate public opinion against Israel. and you, you naive patsy, you rube, you gullible fool, you are falling for this obvious con job hook line and sinker.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;Arab Muslims could not give a shit about...

Let me rephrase that then:

Irish Atheists could not care less about hundreds of thousands of deaths of Arab civilians at the hands of various Arab fascist racist oppressors like the Assad regime backed by the Iranian fascist brown-shirt Ayatollahs and the neo-Nazi Lebanese Hezbollah.

but those same Irish Atheists who themselves support IRA war criminal thugs, sitting in Irish Parliament today who murdered hundreds of innocent civilians and who belong in the Hague serving life in prison for war crimes, 

Those same Irish Atheists  who care less about Assad's hundreds of thousands of victims than they do about a fly, those same Irish Atheists who support the presence of mass murdering serial killers that make Charles Manson look like an amateur sitting in Irish Parliament,  

these same Irish Atheist become hysterically obsessively outraged should tiny Israel, surrounded by enemies, be forced to defend itself from more than 2800 explosive tipped missiles shot at its major population centers by an evil fascist enemy that has embedded itself deliberately inside the civilian population and unfortunately a tiny fraction, less than 1% of the number of civilians die as even in the country right next door.

It's quite remarkable how he's lost his form since then, actually. In the season before last, Lees was by far our strongest centre half and looked like scoring goals at set pieces as well as one of our more competent players (we definitely seemed short of them back then) in contrast to Pearce, who seemed like a complete liability. Last season it was the polar opposite with Pearce a constant set piece threat, leader at the back, and generally reliable defender (of which there were few last season) while Lees seemed prone to the odd blunder.

I think that Lees would probably benefit from a transfer, especially with Leeds fans getting on his back now (they seem to be annoyed about him allegedly booting the ball aimlessly all the time, yet I believe he had better passing stats than Pearce), but what gets my goat is that Hockaday has chosen Wootton over him when he has looked worse than Lees in during his time here: he seems shaky when fighting for the ball and constantly loses his man. We really need to get someone good to play alongside Pearce (and ideally a back-up for that person, so that we can push Wootton to 4th choice) or else the defence is still going to be fragile.",0,1406744697,null,0,false,0,cjc7xpd,t3_2c5489,t1_cjc7xpd,t1_cjc7du8,null,1434977588,5,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,5

true,lak47,lfc87,,"&gt; He hasn't been as bad as everyone might think
Yeah. He's been worse than that.
&gt; partially psychological IMO
A full international, capped multiple times for country cannot have these psychological lapses for extended periods. There are 2 parts to being a top player, and I'm sure you understand that. Physical and mental. Glen has lost that mental bit, where he was a step ahead of his marker. 
&gt; You see him lose the ball and think back to all those Johnson is shit posts you saw online.
No, we do not. He has been absolutely dreadful. Raheem covers him a lot of times. Dirk used to earlier. He's a wing back trapped in a RB's body. Glen Johnson loses his man too frequently at the back post. He gives away needless free kicks at crucial times since he cannot keep up with quick, tricky wingers. 
In a way, he is now becoming what Carra was towards the end of his career here. A slow, lethargic, scared defender who will play deep since he cant rely on pace or power, and in the process drag the entire line with him, encouraging attacks from the middle or long shots from the opposition. 
&gt; wasn't that bad
But was bad. Just not that. 
&gt; One of his downfalls I feel was he took a shot almost every 110 minutes and yet he didn't score a single goal. That means almost every game Liverpool fans were watching him spoon one over the bar from a promising position time and time again thinking 'For god's sake Glen, get your shit together'
Defensively when he actually made a tackle more often than not he won it in fact yet again one of the highest duel success rates around at wingback but the number of tackles he made a game wasn't great.
What you dont see from those numbers is how apt Zabaleta or Azipilcihedsjkdf is at breaking up play BEFORE the need to tackle arises. They're reading the game much quicker than Glen. Glen relies on the tackle much more as evidenced by numbers since he does not have the other tools ala Zabaleta and Azipisdjcdsklf. What he has going in his favor is that he is a good tackler. But when a tackle doesnt come off, you give away free kicks in dangerous areas. And the fact that you had to resort to a tackle is that you are already beaten, and it's a last ditch effort.

No, that's part of the issue. The other part being his stupid fucking tear-my-hair-out back passes from deep inside the oppositions half from the god damn byline. We are a team who will increasingly rely on pace as evidenced by signings this year. To be in advances positions and have the game broken by a fuck all back pass breaks down your momentum and a whole move. I hate that about Glen more than anything currently. He can swiftly destroy moves we stitch up at breakneck speeds. If he has the pace (which I think he doesnt) why does he not use it to beat a man? Why rely on the midfield time and time again to rescue you from an advanced position. If he does do all the above correctly he then creates a chance for himself and balloons shots over the bar. It is infuriating.
&gt; From this I'd say his positioning is off. Maybe it was never on. 
Offensively, I'd understand. Defensively where his bread and butter is, if he's being caught in bad positions, he doesnt deserve a run out anymore, ala Kolo. Since Kolo was CB, his errors were more easily noticable. Glen makes an error which indirectly then puts pressure on the line, thus you dont notice him maybe committing too many 'errors' directly. He puts players around him in terrible situations.
Infact, he can easily be one of the worst in a 4 man defense I can currently think of. It would be a nightmare to see David Luiz, Glen Johnson, Sergio Ramos and Jose Enrique line up in defense. Tactically terrible, no discipline, haphazard and more than one weak area. 
&gt; Strange with all his experience but perhaps he's struggling with the system, or from his injuries, perhaps he's lost some desire, perhaps he's not as fit as he was.
Not strange I think, it's been going on from about 3 seasons now. He's grown old IMHO is past it. Quicker we get rid of him, the better for all the youngsters pushing for a starting eleven spot.
&gt; Whatever it is I believe that he's still decent although not a world beater. Is he worth the £100k+ a week we pay him? No but is he half as bad as the League 2 level defender people try and make out he is? Not at all.
He's a liability currently, is what I feel.

&gt;The __Silence__ are a [fictional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiction) ""religious order or movement"" in the British [science fiction television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_television) programme *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*, represented by humanoids with alien-like physical characteristics.  Executive producer [Steven Moffat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Moffat) created the Silence, intending them to be ""scarier"" than past villains in *Doctor Who*. Though the phrase ""Silence will fall"" recurred throughout the [2010 series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(series_5\)) of *Doctor Who*, the Silence were not seen until the [2011 series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(series_6\))' opener ""[The Impossible Astronaut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Impossible_Astronaut)"". Their origins are eventually revealed in the 2013 special ""[The Time of the Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Time_of_the_Doctor)"".

Both him and Skrtel are guilty of making errors in these situations. 

Because of his injury record, he was always more likely to leave this window than Skrtel in which it's been obvious for a while if another CB was coming in, one of them would be leaving. Skrtel was close to leaving last year before the season started, let alone if we added another one.


He deserves playing time, and I'm happy it looks to be at a club as prestigious as Barca. He may even be a good word in the ear of targets we have over there. I'll still love him like I do Xabi and hope he comes back to us as a coach, or just to visit for games later.

Source? A quick Google search for comments on Enrique since his injury just returns quotes saying things such as ""He’s had a good spell in America. He’s rehabilitating well here."" Rodgers *did* publicly question his work ethic in early 2013 but this is unrelated to his injury. On a side note, I'm fairly confident our medical team would have had him back if he needed to be.

With regards his ""dicking around"", what do you want him to do? Kickups in his garden? Running round cones all night? Practise slide tackling his wife?

true,MadArend,num20,,"I'm one of Dawson's biggest supporters around here, and I will say that he is not a *great* CB, but he is a very good one.  I'm not huge fan of Whoscored ratings for defensive play, but they do provide something of a grounding point.  And Dawson's rating of 7.16 was the same as Kompany's (who had a somewhat down year for him) and higher than John Terry's and David Luiz's.  More interesting to me is the fact that Dawson oversaw almost all of our clean sheets last season, and at one point fairly late in the season he was tied for first among all defenders in the league in clean sheets.  Again, just stats, take from them what you will.

/u/cacafogo makes a great point that Dawson is well-suited to play in a counterattacking side, a not so well-suited to play in a possession side that gets counterattacked.  We were the latter last year, and he was still our best CB, but obviously neither he nor we were good enough to reach the CL.  And that's the thing: *Dawson is exactly good enough for where we are (5th-6th), but probably not quite good enough for where we want to be (1st-4th).*  At least, as a first-choice starter.

/u/smokey815 observed that Dawson is our 4th best CB, when everyone is fit.  With everyone fit and in form, Vertonghen and Kaboul are probably both among the five best CB's in the league, and might be the best CB pairing in the league ... so there is no shame in being below them.  I'd say he's actually vying for 3rd with Chiriches -- Vlad might shine in Poch's system, but so far he's been prone to lapses of concentration and slightly Luiz-ish play that gives me pause, so I'm not ready to say he's definitely ahead of Dawson.

To everyone saying that Dawson will be terrible in Pochettino's system, let me remind you that the worst possible system for Dawson was last year's suicidally-high-line-with-no-pressing-and-now-that-Sherwood's-here-fuck-it-who-needs-system-anyway system, and Dawson was actually *not* terrible even in that.  Under Poch this year, we will continue to be a possession side that gets counterattacked, which ain't great for Dawson.  But the high press that Poch employs slows down and often disrupts counterattacks, giving Dawson and his partner time to get back and set themselves.  Hell, just having more than one fit CB for most of the season, and maybe even consistent partnerships, will be a boost for us and for our skipper.

**TL;DR:** Yeah, Dawson's not quite good enough to be a first-choice starter in a top 4 side, but he's better than many are giving him credit for.  He really isn't awful even in systems that don't suit him, and although Poch's system isn't ideal for him, he'll still do pretty well in it.  Well enough to be 3rd/4th choice behind Vert/Kaboul (what a pairing!) and maaaayyyybe Vlad.

**EDIT:** Poch's system also makes Dawson's long diagonal balls more effective.  As it is, they succeed about 60% of the time, which isn't bad for long passing.  But with the high press, that 40% when they don't succeed will still frequently result in our gaining possession in the opponent's half.  And for sure, that's a lot better than conceding possession in *our* half because of wayward short passing, which is one of Dawson's weaknesses.",0,1406745913,null,0,1406751544,0,cjc8msp,t3_2c4now,t1_cjc8msp,t3_2c4now,null,1434977948,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

true,widgetas,null,null,"There are three studies in particular that WHO use to promote circumcision. There are a ton of problems with them, but when the conversation is about routine infant (ritual) circumcision these studies can be dismissed out of hand. The studies were performed in sub-Saharan Africa on willing volunteers. The control group were sent away and were sexually active the entire time. The circumcised group weren't having sex for the initial period of 'repair'. They also got advice and condoms (afaik) when they returned for check ups. Plus the ~60% reduction rate was of a rate of something like 2% in the first place, I believe. Quite a few methodological issues I believe. I won't link to any criticisms because it's likely people could call them biased. I leave it as an exercise to the reader to find their own source, for that reason alone.

However, and most importantly: Babies aren't sexually active.

An upshot of the programme though, and one that I think was predicted, is that men now think they are ""immune"" to HIV because they've been cut and are now having unprotected sex. As you might expect, HIV infection rates are on the rise in some areas.

Something else to consider is the rate of HIV in the US being the highest in the Western world. The US also has the highest proportion of cut men in the Western world. Around the globe there is no correlation between infection rates and instances of the population being cut or otherwise.

TL;DR - There's no convincing evidence to imply circumcision reduces HIV infection rates/propensity. However, even if it did, it wouldn't justify cutting baby boys and thus violating their autonomy.

Incidentally there's been at least one study to my knowledge that showed a lower HIV infection rate amongst cut women, compared to intact.

&gt;  Dear,
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for contacting me about the emergency Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act.
&gt;  
&gt; I appreciate your concerns on this issue.  Communications data and interception helps keep people safe from terrorists and other serious, dangerous criminals.  Communications data is used in 95 per cent of all serious and organised crime prosecutions, and every major counter-terrorism investigation over the last decade.
&gt;  
&gt; But we faced losing these powers that are used to counter the threats we face from terrorists and organised criminals. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) struck down regulations that let internet and phone companies retain communications data for law enforcement purposes for 12 months.  As well as this, some companies were calling for a clearer legal framework to underpin their cooperation with law enforcement and intelligence agencies to intercept what terrorists and serious criminals are saying to each other. This is the ability to access content with a warrant signed by a Secretary of State
&gt;  
&gt; The emergency Act enables agencies to maintain existing capabilities.  It responds to the ECJ judgment on data retention and bring clarity to existing law in response to the concerns of some companies.  It is a narrow and limited response to the set of specific challenges we face.  It solves the immediate problems at hand. Importantly, the Act includes a termination clause so it will fall at the end of 2016 – forcing the government to look again at these powers.
&gt;  
&gt; As part of the Act, the Government has placed a review of the interception and communications data powers and capabilities, and the way they are regulated, on a statutory footing.  This review will focus on the safeguards required to protect privacy and include a review of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act to make recommendations to reform and update it. There will also be reports from the Interception of Communications Commissioner every six months to ensure that it is clear that this Act does as the Government intends; it introduces no new powers, but  ensures existing capabilities are maintained.
&gt;  
&gt; Alongside the Act, the Government is also establishing a Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board to ensure civil liberties are properly considered.  The Government is also restricting the number of public bodies that can ask for communications data and publishing annual transparency reports.  This will make more information publicly available than ever before.
&gt;  
&gt; I believe that the action this Government is taking will ensure we maintain powers to help keep us safe from those who would harm UK citizens.
&gt;  
&gt; Thank you again for taking the time to contact me.
&gt;  
&gt; Yours sincerely,
&gt; 
&gt;  Pauline Latham

There's no real reason why they would be expensive, once they reach a tipping point.  They're expensive now of course, as they're all custom bespoke vehicles.  But ultimately, self-driving cars is a software problem, there would be only minor additional costs in terms of raw materials.

It's more like that self-driving cars will only begin to catch on once self-driving commercial vehicles become common-place.  There doesn't appear to be much demand for them for private use, people seem to like driving more than being a passenger.

Short-distance commuters with nightmare stop-start journeys will be first to switch, along side travelling salesmen, etc. who need the free time when on-the-move.

One interesting test is going to be whether people who are banned from driving would be allowed to be the sole-occupant of a self-driving car... and could the notional ""driver"" be held accountable for failing to stop a malfunctioning self-driving car?

I agree with you. In addition to the aforementioned thoughts, I think Johnson also needs a bit more help around him for to him to shine (as opposed to being able to be the helper, if you will).

So, that's why you're hearing rumblings about needing some like Lovren who can organize a defense. That maybe Mignolet needs to be more vocal as well.

Also, I think we can't discount some of the injury issues he dealt with last season. Hopefully he'll be coming into the season 100%.

true,widgetas,null,null,"&gt; but go on to dismiss pro-circumcision evidence from circumcised men as inherently untrustworthy

It's not evidence, it's anecdotes and poor ones at that: If one has never had an intact penis, one cannot know what one is missing. Also it's entirely missing the point that infants are having their bodies violated. In any case the ""people aren't aware of the evidence"" was in relation to the general public in the UK rather than cut men (in the US).

&gt;  It is well established that circumcision helps hygiene and reduces the risk of STIs. 

It's really not. Any study you can provide drawing that conclusion, I shall counter with one showing a neutral or opposite view. In any case, none of it should trump the issue of autonomy which is the foundation of arguing against routine infant cutting.

&gt; allowing men to decide for themselves

I would agree, except to make it clear that it's boys who aren't being given the choice at the moment.

&gt; whilst ensuring that it remains legal so that any procedures that do happen are competently performed

The AAP suggested something similar for some types of FGM (e.g. Type IV). [That didn't go so well.](http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/722840)

&gt; However, to put male circumcision in the same class as FGM is, to my mind, a rather hysterical position that requires one to disregard important and obvious differences in the rationale and long-term effects of what are quite different practices.

Then you missed the entire point of my comment, and I suspect are also unaware of the history of male circumcision in Western countries. For example: female cutting/alterations was introduced and was prevalent at the same time as male cutting and for the same reasons in the late 19th century: reducing masturbation and ills associated with it, mainly. Female cutting fell out of favour in the 1920's I believe, while male cutting did not and increased in favour for various reasons. Yay for the Victorians...

[I really would recommend watching the five minute video that I posted a link to in my original comment. It makes the point about comparing FGM and MGM far clearer than my comment.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98f3IavuEgQ)

If you don't watch that, then I can ask one simple question. Do you think that Type IV FGM - a pin prick/a ritual nick to draw blood - is ""worse"" than normal male circumcision whereby the entire foreskin is excised? If no: OK... Not much I can say to that apart from the obvious. If yes: So there are types of MGM that are worse than FGM, and my original comment stands and in an entirely non-hysterical way. Thanks for that not-so-veiled insult, btw.

By the by, are you aware that more than one baby boy has died following complications due to circumcision in the last 10 years in the UK? Yet no women/girls have died (that we know of) due to FGM complications. In no way am I suggesting that we should dismiss FGM issues because of that (far, far from it), rather it should underline my point that MGM result in far more attention and anger from the general public. How many boys would have to die before it's ""too many"" would you say?

This is a word of god moment and it trumps all personal feelings about the show. Since this is a retcon, it changes everything about that aspect of the character backwards and forwards in time. In the grand scheme of things, all the times he says he's much older is a time when he was lying or simply forgot. After the 2005 series started, he sees no reason to lie anymore because he's the only one left. 

After Trensalore, he's 2100 years old. 

Fandom answer: Whatever age you want. This particular fandom, more than any other fandom I've seen, thinks it's own particular head canon is more important than what's on the show. Some prefer to think the Doctor's ages are how long he's been in that body. Other's think the classic series takes precedent. Most think that he's been doing it for so long, that he forgets what year it is.

Dier obviously is fluent in English and born here so would settle much quicker. Wouldn't be suprised if he's a prospect to cover the so so fitness of Kaboul and departure of Dawson. 

The general consensus by River fans is that he (Balanta) was/is moving to Europe this year. The other defender in South America who I feel is ready is Doria from Botafogo, who looks head &amp; shoulders above many his age worldwide and he'll follow suit to Europe soon too.

Factor in Cambridge's reputation for IT and being 'Silicon Fen', which means interest in Bitcoin would probably be higher here than in any comparably sized UK city, and it shows we are still at a very early stage on the adoption curve:

Anyway, getting to the point, yes it's not exactly in use, but neither is it abandoned and empty. When I was there three weeks ago there were these guys on the side of the building dangling from ropes doing something to it, right high up on the side of it and a few even on one of the chimneys.

So I wonder if he *can* ""just drop it,"" esp since they were last seen in the last three episodes 2013.

I really thought at one point that they'd be like the Silents (not malevolent by nature). But after my nearly-full rewatch, I guessed maybe someone booby-trapped Tranzadore with angels so *only* the Doctor could get through, and ""movement"" is how they'd know the Doctor had arrived.

Whatever they are, I hope if they show up again, Moff *goes somewhere* with their story. WAs seem to sort of be in stasis (no pun): we know little more about them now then when they were first introduced. I wouldn't mind one WA episode to ""clean up this loose end"", so WAs don't become a larger legend than ever intended.

If Moffat plans to keep using the angels, though, I just hope we learn something about them, and they're not just ""there"" to spook the viewer (that's what it feels like to me). I've seen ONE episode with them I liked, where they did something new: the one where Eyes-Closed-Amy had to ease *through* them on that forest spaceship, and they went towards the light.

&gt;

&gt;A __Catch dog__ is a specially trained dog that is used to catch large animals in [hunting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting), working livestock, and [baiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog-baiting).  

&gt;As hunters, catch dogs are contrasted with [bay dogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_dog) who corner prey animals and alert their handler by howling, or [baying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_(dog\)). Catch dogs are typically outfitted with chest armor to prevent being speared by the boar's tusk, and neck armor to prevent neck injury.  

&gt;As livestock dogs, catch dogs use their weight and teeth to immobilize live animals so that they can be captured, or literally [hogtied](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogtie), by the dog's handlers, who may be [stockmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockmen), [hunters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunters), [butchers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butcher), or [farmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmer).

I did a short stint going from Swanley to Chertsey and it was the absolute worst and I would not recommend it. But that was 40+ miles on just the M25 in the peak of rush hour traffic.

In contrast, I spent 5 years going from Swanley to East Grinstead and that journey was fine for the most part. Any time there was terrible M25 traffic I could avoid it by taking slightly slower back roads.

Arriving at 7am should mean that you avoid the majority of the traffic. In my experience the M25 tends to not get awful until after 7 - 7.30. Similarly getting off at 4.30 should mean the same thing.

So they are in the process of being registered as schools, which would put them under the remit of the DoE. Part of that would mean that they would have to teach an approved curriculum.

&gt;Eric Dier is very close to a move to Tottenham. According to the Maisfutebol found, the English club and Sporting still negotiate this time of the transfer station, but are close to an agreement that is pleasing to both parties. the next few days, probably a couple of them, the understanding can be full and the transfer can be made ​​official. Segundo was possible to know both Tottenham and financial arguments for Tottenham pleases Eric Dier, so will be able to play in the home country. Either way, and as has been customary in transfers of players leonine, Sporting should keep a percentage of capital gains as a way of valuing a future transfer. Eric Dier, central twenty years, has been widely used by Marco Silva at this pre-season, taking advantage of the absence of Marcos Rojo, but did not yet being on the market. Sporting was open to review proposals by the player. Yet this sense, then much has been spoken of Newcastle and Everton, Tottenham emerged with convincing financial arguments. After two seasons in the Everton team B at the end of step training, Eric Dier can play for the first time at the highest level in the home country and can fight for a place in the U-21 England. The player, moreover, was displeased by the rare use last season: only 16 games, of which eleven as a starter. Completion of business, we have said, will be for days.

He was captain of the successful U15 outfit at Sporting, (and having captained his team in the previous two seasons), Dier  progressed to be a regular in the U17 squad, while also turning out for the U19s - the traditional stepping stone to first-team squad consideration.

Under the mentorship of the legendary Paulo Cardoso, who scouted both Ronaldo and Nani for the Lisbon squad, Dier is tipped to progress into the senior side within two years.

His exploits have been recognised by the national team, with Portugal attempting to select him instead of England - but he wants to represent England. He was also Loaned to Everton and was their under 18 captain, and had some pretty rave reviews there. He has represented England at under 18, 19, 20 and 21 levels. 

Little Fact : Within 4 minutes of his first start for Sporting, he assisted the only goal of the game.

I get that *Jeff* decided he wouldn't be Jeff, and that was a choice, but did the Doctor entity decide to ""not count"" the ninth regeneration as a Doctor, or did the Sisters take that power (is it a ""power""?

Yes, but circumcisions are often carried out in later life and those men do know what is missing! That's evidence we can presumably take into account?

Whilst I take the ""you don't know what you're missing"" argument up to a point, I'm often uncomfortable with how it's used in the debate. Does it mean that the considered views of those circumcised from infancy are entirely irrelevant? That seems excessive.

&gt; It's really not. Any study you can provide drawing that conclusion, I shall counter with one showing a neutral or opposite view. 

Yes, that seems to be a point upon which few agree.

&gt; In any case, none of it should trump the issue of autonomy which is the foundation of arguing against routine infant cutting.

I actually agree, but that argument is so often drowned out by the howls of moral outrage.

&gt; except to make it clear that it's boys who aren't being given the choice at the moment

Badly worded on my part. I meant boys should be left intact until they are men and can make the decision themselves.

&gt; The AAP suggested something similar for some types of FGM (e.g. Type IV)

Fair enough, I can see how that backfired. There is of course a difference when it comes to male circumcision, as that is a practice already legal and more commonplace in western society than FGM, but my broader point was that policy must be primarily geared at changing the demand for circumcision whilst not making the situation worse.

&gt; Then you missed the entire point of my comment, and I suspect are also unaware of the history of male circumcision in Western countries.

I think i did, and I certainly admit I don't know a great deal about the history or different types of genital modification. That video was helpful, thank you.

&gt; Thanks for that not-so-veiled insult, btw.

My bad, but it is true of a lot of the way this topic is discussed. I wasn't aware of the range of FGM/MGM practices - my understanding of FGM was that it was at least a clitorectomy and so equating that to the removal of the prepuce did (and does) seem over the top.

&gt; By the by, are you aware that more than one baby boy has died following complications due to circumcision in the last 10 years in the UK? 

Yes I am, which is one of the reasons I am so concerned about the prospect of these practices being driven underground. If they are going to happen, I'd much rather they happen in a clinical environment.

&gt; Yet no women/girls have died (that we know of) due to FGM complications. In no way am I suggesting that we should dismiss FGM issues because of that (far, far from it), rather it should underline my point that MGM result in far more attention and anger from the general public. How many boys would have to die before it's ""too many"" would you say?

I'm not too sure I follow the point here. Are you saying that the circumcisions going wrong get more attention than FGM going wrong because it is happening to boys? Because I would argue that it probably gets more attention because circumcision is seen as commonplace and safe (so a death is unusual/outrageous) and FGM is seen as rare and unsafe (and so death not much more unusual/outrageous than the practice itself). But as I say, I may have missed your point.

&gt; How many boys would have to die before it's ""too many"" would you say?

It's not particularly surprising that copyright infringement is seen as no big deal by most. On the one hand we've had years of these industries whining about how much piracy and copyright infringement hurt them (whether true or not). On the other the budget or the gross on the latest big film are always hitting the headlines. The musicians we see are all raking it in. Hardly sympathetic imagery!

I'm not trying to suggest that all musicians are, quite the opposite, but the ones that get all the publicity are. If these lobby groups bothered to put a human face on things maybe there'd be more sympathy and support for the law. As it stands it has been twisted up into something arcane and meandering with a duration so long as to be effectively endless.

I actually tried to get some clarification on how the law applies to tabletop gaming rules a while back. Game mechanics aren't subject to copyright (although in theory they can be patented). I was trying to find out if the specific numbers that make the game mechanics work are considered part of that (and so legally unencumbered) or whether they're considered part of the text (and so covered under the copyright legislation for written works).

You know what [they](http://www.ipo.gov.uk/) told me? **That I would have to go through the courts in order to get an answer**.

There's something messed up when no one will even tell the general public what's illegal and what isn't. They're the Intellectual Property Office - it's literally their job to deal with intellectual property issues.

I can't afford to pay a lawyer just to hazard a guess at what the law is.

true,SecretApe,,"His name is John Carew, he's bigger than the two of you!","1. This will be a season of uncertainty for Aston Villa, it's very difficult to predict where Aston Villa will finish for many reasons. Fans don't know how the side will play with the return of the 'bomb-squad' and the signings of experienced Cole, Richardson and Senedros. 
I think most fans would agree that we might struggle a bit in the first half of the season, both Benteke and Kozak will still be missing and I'm not certain Villa will spend too much more during this transfer window.
However, should Aston Villa find a new owner investment will surely be made during January, should we be in trouble. So in all, no, I reckon Aston Villa will finish mid-table but only under the condition that a new owner is found before the January transfer window.

2. Very difficult to predict, especially due to the uncertainty of our captain Ron Vlaar, but if I had to pick a side today:
* ----------Guzan-------------
* Lowton-Vlaar-Okore-Richardson
* --Cole--Westwood--Delph------
* Weimann--Agbonlahor--N'Zogbia

On a side note, it's believed that Paul Lambert and Roy Keane are deciding between making out main formation 4-3-3 or 5-3-2 this season.

3.
Not a player, but I reckon Roy Keane will be one to watch. It'll be interesting if he'll make a massive difference at Villa. We've been lacking fire and I reckon Keane would be the person to bring the spark back to Villa. Plus, it's Roy Keane, he'll probably end up being Aston Villa's biggest signing of the transfer window.

Young player: Jack Grealish: 18 year old winger who is having a very impressive pre-season. Grealish went out on loan to Notts County last season and impressed everyone, made a difference to a side that avoided relegation in League 1. So far in Pre-season he has scored a goal and impressed fans and players with his dribbling and flair down the wing. Could possibly replace Albrighton this season.

Point-to-prove: Charles N'Zogbia: After missing last season through 'injury', it's good to see N'Zogbia playing regularly for Aston Villa during the pre-season fixtures. N'Zogbia has been scoring goals and has been very creative, something we have lacked. N'Zogbia will definitely make a come-back this season and will inspire Aston Villa in some games.

Most exciting new signing: Kieran Richardson: I will admit, Richardson doesn't sound like an exciting signing, but he's actually made a difference so far in our squad. He's played at left-back, left midfield and as a central forward. And he's done well, he's been by far the most lively new signing and has added some creativity to the side. Plus, Lambert loves his versatile players.",0,1406751198,null,0,false,0,cjcblht,t3_2c6384,t1_cjcblht,t3_2c6384,null,1434979248,7,false,avfc,t5_2s569,7

He's cheap, 2 year option; in which time Torres will be off our books, Drogba will be a coach, and Bamford will be ready to step up. Alternatively we could try and get Miroslav 'NoGoalsAt21' Klose, but he's recently signed a one year extension to his contract at Lazio.

For a short term option... there's not much out there that would be an upgrade on Lukaku. I'm not a massive Ballotelli fan, but if we're looking at long term, he'd be my primary suggestion.

This is why I hate deleting the episodes ever (though I have to or I'll crash the hdd): I've run across databases on the internet that list the episodes, **but some lists are just wrong** (out of order, incomplete, different episode names even —though I think some people adopt a convention of listing ""double episodes"" using only one name or the other).

Plus the BBC onscreen guide for DISH has been mistaken about episode counts *and even episode names* so often I don't even use it much anymore. Seriously: they've listed ""Boom Town"" as ep 110 (example only), and a later episode would also be listed as ""ep 110"". Or I'll queue up an episode by name, and it's a Who episode, but *the wrong one*. This is why I started my own database, and use what the episode calls itself in its opening sequence.

So I haven't seen ""The Christmas Invasion"", either, *I don't think.* And I just looked at your list of River episodes, and some of those aren't even listed in my database. DVD shorts, maybe?

It's tough, I'm crushed that we let Lukaku go this year would have been a perfect time for him to step up and fill that back up void. I'm also crushed that we have to deal with Torres for yet another season. I was certain that he would be gone this year, and now that is obviously not true.

Could we push for Rues? I know he's been primarily a winger, just a thought.

Aubameyang? Don't know much about it, but a thought.

Hell what about Osvaldo?

If there's any chance in the world City would sell a striker? I mean they've got 4 right now that could be starter caliber for many teams. I mean I'm sure we would end up paying over the price tag, but there's another thought.

Did Benteke just sign a new contract? Sounds familiar but he's a thought, not sure if he'd be happy as a back up role.

Jackson Martinez? He was rumored to be coming here before Costa signed officially so it's still a thought.

I feel like those are the main players who actually have a chance of coming. We missed out on a lot of players so far. Mandzukic would have been good and at the top of my list.

I really hope we don't go after Cavani though. I'm sure he wouldn't want to come either but there's been some discussion on here about it. There' just something about him that makes me feel like he would produce in the EPL. Everytime I watched him he was sub par (on his national team, *and* when PSG played against us in the CL). I'm sure some people will disagree and that's fine. We have no idea how it would play out, I just don't like him and hope we don't sign him.

*edit-* a few more options

Bony? Looked solid last season, don't know if he'd be happy at a back up role, and have to fight for it against Torres.

Huntelaar? I've always liked him, same deal with Bony don't know if he'd be happy with that role. If we could unload Torres and get one of them I'd be ecstatic.",0,1406752042,null,0,1406752315,0,cjcc2t9,t3_2c68o3,t1_cjcc2t9,t3_2c68o3,null,1434979494,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

The Euston Tap is usually pretty good about having a nice selection of UK craft beers, especially some of the London ones (ie. last week I remember seeing Pressure Drop, Moor Brewery, Magic Rock, Thornbridge. etc, they've had Camden Town quite a bit, a large bottle selection and some continental beers like Weihenstephaner as well). Across the road is the Cider Tap if you want to try some UK cider. Don't be shy to ask for a few samples before you buy stuff.

For Brewdog which was being discussed - if you head north from Euston into Camden, they have a dedicated pub there that you'll probably enjoy. It's definitely walkable but as you'd be right next to the station you can simply take 1-2 stops north on the Northern Line.

&gt;&gt;*For other meanings see [mosquito (disambiguation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito_(disambiguation\)).*

&gt;__The Mosquito__ or __Mosquito alarm__ is an electronic device used to deter [loitering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loitering) by young people by emitting sound at high frequency, in some versions so it can only be heard by younger people. The devices have attracted controversy on the basis of human rights and discrimination concerns.

&gt;The device is marketed as a safety and security tool for preventing youths from congregating in specific areas. As such, it is promoted to reduce [anti-social behaviour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-social_behaviour) such as [loitering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loitering), [graffiti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti), [vandalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandalism), [drug use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drugs), drug distribution, and violence. In the UK, over 3,000 have been sold, mainly for use outside shops and near [transport hubs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_hub).  The device is also sold in Australia, France, Denmark, Italy, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, Canada and the USA.

true,layendecker,crest-new,OLD CREST 4EVA,"He is essentially the opposite type of player to Lukaku, considering their physical similarities. 

He is very, very good at bringing others into play, and picking up speculative balls that have been pushed forward. He plays with back to goal very well, and has mad technique in finishing, so manages to get shots away that he really shouldn't be able to. He is also stunning at moving out wide, whilst always being in the right spot in the box when he needs to be. 

Lukaku (as you know) is a guy who plays facing goal, and hangs off defenders shoulders. He is essentially a fast striker in a target mans body- but is pretty poor as a target man.

Drogba was closer to Fellaini (when he played up top), but with more Balotelli esque finishing ability, but he also had this mental burst of pace that allows him to lose defenders on crosses. If I were to compare a prime Drogba to a current player, it would probably be Falcao, but (IMO) he was better...

[A few years ago it was closed while a cracked tie rod was replaced.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/7983615.stm)

Without constant care and maintenance, anything will degrade quite quickly. Just because you dont neccessarily see the work going on doesnt mean that it doesnt take place.

&gt;Clifton Suspension Bridge will be standing for a long time more - It's made by flippin' Isambard Kingdom-Brunel.

Brunel was innovative for the time but even he cannot change the laws of physics. Another bridge of his, The Royal Albert Bridge in Plymouth was recently closed for a 3 year, £10m overhaul as well. 

&gt;PS - looking at the bridge right now and it seems fine.

Particularly with fatigue damage and crack propagation, the lack of visible damage to the naked eye doesnt mean a whole lot. Critical flaw size (the size of flaw to caused a stressed item to fail) can be absolutely tiny - below a centimeter. Even when visual defects are visible, they might not be seen as significant. With a brittle material like wrought iron, the fact that a defect is visible with the naked eye would be very, very worrying indeed, although this is normally true with most bridges.

He ended up winning player of the year and earned a starting spot on the Spanish WC team. Probably a more difficult accomplishment to break into a starting defense than to get ample minutes as a second choice striker (especially considering Mourinho likes a settled back 4 and del Bosque likes veteran/La Liga players).

At 21 I honestly believe working with a world class Chelsea squad with one of the best managers in the world and under the tutelage of one of his heroes would be better for his overall development even if it means less minutes/goals in his immediate future than being the big fish in a small pond at Everton. Competition for spots is a good thing for both the team and the individual. I think its a shortsighted move from Lukaku, especially considering Chelsea was supposedly his childhood club. I'd be fucking ecstatic if I had that opportunity at such a young age.

I'm not crying about it at all. If he doesn't have the fight in him then I don't want him at Chelsea. I don't hate him; I just don't really have much respect for him anymore. You asked if the same attitude applies to Sturridge and I said no because he stuck it out and gave us all he had. I still respect Sturridge and enjoy watching him play, even if its for Liverpool.

Lukaku acted wrongly sometimes, but he is young (21 FFS) I'm 23 and I sure as hell know I don't make the best decisions or say the right things half the time, and that's with zero scrutiny from people online, the media, a football club, and the millions in the broader footballing world! 

It's just a theory, but I feel like Rom didn't feel loved or appreciated by the club, he may have been immature, but I think if the club wanted they could have easily made the effort to keep him. You can tell Rom thrives off of attention and affection, which he got from Roberto Martinez. 

For me the reason it hurts the most is because of that video where he professed to play in Stamford Bridge one day. He would have been one of the first generations to grow up watching a whole new and winning Chelsea, and one with Chelsea in his heart. I can only dream of having that talent to make that dream come true. I think its why so many of us are so harsh on him, many of us would do anything to have the talent and opportunity Lukaku had. 

But at the end of the day I can't hate him. Who knows, maybe we'll buy him  back in a few years, a more developed and hopefully more mature player like we did with Matic. 

Until then I just hope Rom keeps battering our competition whilst failing miserably against us.  ",0,1406753907,null,0,false,0,cjcd5ik,t3_2c65on,t1_cjcd5ik,t3_2c65on,null,1434979968,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

WE come on to the field with a guy who has never started for us and just signed on monday, we played Mulgrew in the midfield in replace of brown, Mulgrew who has been a liability or the past 2 fucking years btw, we score an early goal and get ahead of ourselves, they bounce back from Matthews not concentrating and make it 1-1, fair enough, game on.

The next goal that comes in, Ambrose kicks the ball out to mulgrew he cant control it, warsaw comes up and makes it 2-1 then about what 20 minutes later Ambrose plays the ball forward to Mulgrew **AGAIN** he miss controls it **AGAIN** the ball is in possession of Warsaw and Ambrose is forced in to tackling him, gets sent off now we are 2-1 down with 10 men.

**See a pattern here?**

Alright, halftime you expect maybe to take mulgrew off, bring on izzaguire play lustig as cb and Iza on the left and matthews on the right?

**NO** 

**NO, HE FUCKING PLAYS THE GUY WHO CANT CONTROL THE FUCKING BALL AND made THE BUILD UP TO US GOING 2-1 DOWN AND LOSING A MAN, Yeah that seems like a great idea, play a fucking donkey at the back.**

We then concede a penalty, from MULGREW, making a fucking stupid tackle, MISS, ok we are still in this.

Too bad we have 10 men and are just losing the ball in the midfield from the fact of playing 3 in it, Concede a goal, alright its kind of a pattern here.

A fight breaks out between players, Mulgrew our CAPTAIN no where to be seen, NO WHERE, arent you meant to fucking control the players and calm our team down?

They get another penalty, MULGREW PULLS HIS SHIRT, Forster saves it, bailed us out again.

Then the last goal comes 4 men at the back, they have 2 attakcing, kick the ball right across our defense and score somehow, fucking wow.

This Celtic team is a fucking disgrace and a shadow of what it was 2 seasons ago, we have next to no Quality in the team Bar 3-4 players, and the usual ""Buy low sell big tactic"" is keeping us fans wondering the same question? If we just sold 4 players for big value and played champions league football for the past 2 years, why the fuck are we buying nobodys?

Is it the league? No

Is it the team isnt good enough? No

Is it there isnt much appeal at Celtic? Not necessarily 

Is it the board not spending and scared to go in to debt? YES OH FUCKING YES

The board has been the chain around Celtics neck for years upon years and will continue to be it.

Not only that, when we keep hiring managers who are scared shitless to take off or not play our ""experienced"" players, Mulgrew and Kayal are NOT GOOD ENOUGH for this club.


I don't care if we play in the SPL, 2 years ago we qualified for the last 16 off the champions elague, beating Barcelona 2-1 at home, the Summer comes, we sold 3 of those players and didnt fill the gaps with the same or better quality, we put our faith in back ups for the next season and scraped the Champions league then got demolished in the groups.

I and many other Celtic fans should realize, this defeats is what our board deserves, our board has a HUGE fan base, an amazing stadium, world wide appeal and every years or so brings in up and coming talents, yet we rely on players who have been shit for the past couple of seasons, buy substitues from half ass teams and EXPECT to get Champions League every year. **WAKE THE FUCK UP.**

**TL:DR Mulgrew is fucking terrible and isnt good enough to sit on our bench, the team has 3-4 talents which will be sold if we dont qualify for Europe, the board are cunts who are afraid to spend and have the logic of buy 10 poor/average players and give them the wage of 10k instead of buy 3 good/quality players and give them 33k a week.**",0,1406754173,null,0,false,0,cjcdb0w,t3_2c6cy4,t1_cjcdb0w,t3_2c6cy4,null,1434980086,13,false,ScottishFootball,t5_2sba4,13

- Don't want him to cause Targett to not get any game time. I think most of us feel developing and utilising our own talent is more important than loaning (and developing) someone else's, but it's nice to have depth in the position anyway.

But, her relationship with The Doctor was different from any other companions, because he got to know her first as a little girl he shared fish fingers and custard with, and then got to meet the woman she had become, and then she became his ""mother-in-law"". So, his relationship with her was always very twisty and turny, as it was a constantly changing target. 

   He started with a girl who grew up near a crack in time, wound up with a woman who hated him for abandoning her when she was a child, but at the same time had never given up idolizing this raggedy man. She then makes a pass at the Doctor, before realizing how foolish she had been, and then loses the man she really did love, and then forgets she ever knew him. Then she gets him back, but he almost kills her, and she gets locked away in suspended animation/regeneration for 2000 years. Then her past gets a re-set, but if she hadn't remembered who she was, The Doctor would've been erased forever from time.  And that's just the first season she was on the show.

**The Nature of the Infection**


The years pass, and the arguments go back and forth over whether watched fiction actually has an effect on the reader or the viewer. Does violent fiction make a reader violent? Does frightening fiction create a watcher who is frightened, or desensitised to fear?

It’s not a yes, or a no. It’s a yes but.

The complaint about Dr Who from adults was always, when I was small, that it was too frightening. This missed, I think, the much more dangerous effect of Dr Who: that it was viral.

Of course it was frightening. More or less. I watched the good bits from behind the sofa, and was always angry and cheated and creeped out by the cliffhanger in the final moments. But that had, as far as I can tell, no effect on me at all, as I grew, the fear. The real complaint, the thing that the adults should have been afraid of and complaining about was what it did to the inside of my head. How it painted my interior landscape. 

When I was three, making Daleks out of the little school milk bottles, with the rest of the kids at Mrs Pepper’s Nursery School, I was in trouble and I didn’t know it. The virus was already at work.

Yes, I was scared of the Daleks and the Zarbi and the rest. But I was taking other, stranger, more important lessons away from my Saturday tea-time serial.

For a start, I had become infected by the idea that there are an infinite number of worlds, only a footstep away. 

And another part of the meme was this: some things are bigger on the inside than they are on the outside. And, perhaps, some people are bigger on the inside than they are on the outside, as well.

And that was only the start of it. The books helped with the infection – the Dalek World one, and the various hardcovered Dr Who Annuals. They contained the first written SF stories I had encountered. They left me wondering if there was anything else like that out there...

But the greatest damage was still to come.

It’s this: the shape of reality – the way I perceive the world – exists only because of Dr Who. Specifically, from The War Games in 1969, the multipart series that was to be Patrick Troughton’s swan song.

This is what remains to me of The War Games as I look back on it, over three decades after I saw it: The Doctor and his assistants find themselves in a place where armies fight: an interminable World War One battlefield, in which armies from the whole of time have been stolen from their original spatio-temporal location and made to fight each other. Strange mists divide the armies and the time zones. Travel between the time zones is possible, using a white, boxlike structure approximately the same size and shape as a smallish lift, or, even more prosaically, a public toilet: you get in in 1970, you come out in Troy or Mons or Waterloo. Only you don’t come out in Waterloo, as you’re really on an eternal plane, and behind it all or beyond it all is an evil genius who has taken the armies, placed them here, and is using the white boxes to move guards and agents from place to place, through the mists of time.

The boxes were called SIDRATs. Even at the age of eight I figured that one out.

Finally, having no other option, and unable to resolve the story in any other way, the Doctor – who we learned now was a fugitive – summoned the Time Lords, his people, to sort the whole thing out. And was, himself, captured and punished.

It was a great ending for an eight-year old. There were ironies I relished. 
It would, I have no doubt at all, be a bad thing for me to try and go back and watch The War Games now. It’s too late anyway; the damage has been done. It redefined reality. The virus was now solidly in place.

These days, as a middle-aged and respectable author, I still feel a sense of indeterminate but infinite possibility on entering a lift, particularly a small one with white walls. That to date the doors that have opened have always done so in the same time, and world, and even the same building in which I started out seems merely fortuitous – evidence only of a lack of imagination on the part of the rest of the universe.

I do not confuse what has not happened with what cannot happen, and in my heart, Time and Space are endlessly malleable, permeable, frangible.

Let me make some more admissions.

In my head, William Hartnell was the Doctor, and so was Patrick Troughton. All the other Doctors were actors, although Jon Pertwee and Tom Baker were actors playing real Doctors. The rest of them, even Peter Cushing, were faking it.

In my head the Time Lords exist, and are unknowable - primal forces who cannot be named, only described: The Master, the Doctor, and so on. All depictions of the home of the Time Lords are, in my head, utterly non-canonical. The place in which they exist cannot be depicted because it is beyond imagining: a cold place that only exists in black and white.

It’s probably a good thing that I’ve never actually got my hands on the Doctor. I would have unhappened so much.

A final Dr Who connection – again, from the baggy-trousered Troughton era, when some things were more than true for me – showed itself, in retrospect, in my BBC TV series, Neverwhere.

Not in the obvious places – the BBC decision that Neverwhere had to be shot on video, in episodes half an hour long, for example. Not even in the character of the Marquis de Carabas, who I wrote – and Paterson Joseph performed – as if I were creating a Doctor from scratch, and wanted to make him someone as mysterious, as unreliable, and as quirky as the William Hartnell incarnation. But in the idea that there are worlds under this one, and that London itself is magical, and dangerous, and that the underground tunnels are every bit as remote and mysterious and likely to contain Yeti as the distant Himalayas was something, author and critic Kim Newman pointed out to me, while Neverwhere was screening, that I probably took from a Troughton-era story called “The Web of Death”. 

And as he said it, I knew he was spot on, remembering people with torches exploring the underground, beams breaking the darkness. The knowledge that there were worlds underneath... yes, that was where I got it, all right. 

Having caught the virus, I was now, I realised with horror, infecting others.

Which is, perhaps, one of the glories of Dr Who. It doesn’t die, no matter what. It’s still serious, and it’s still dangerous. The virus is out there, just hidden, and buried, like a plague pit.

You don’t have to believe me. Not now. But I’ll tell you this. The next time you get into a lift, in a shabby office building, and jerk up several floors, then, in that moment before the doors open, you’ll wonder, even if only for a moment, if they’re going to open on a Jurassic jungle, or the moons of Pluto, or a full service pleasure dome at the galactic core...

That’s when you’ll discover that you’re infected too.

And then the doors will open, with a grinding noise like a universe in pain, and you’ll squint at the light of distant suns, and understand...

I once went after some rights that Hasbro own but had forgotten they had, so know how this sort of thing goes.

Does anyone remember Action Force? It was a mixture of anglicised versions of GI Joe comics and some original stuff probably written by Pat Mills and John Wagner. The original stuff was really good and there was a fan project to scan it all in and colour it and put it online. Most of the recolouring was actually quite shit, but I thought that there would be a small market for hard copy reprints.

I was working for a company that did licensed Transformers stuff at the time anyway, so tried to find out about Action Force. Hasbro bought/inherited it via a fairly convoluted series of acquisitions, but didn't have any idea about it. What I was told was that so long as the GI Joe links weren't prominent in any way, no one from Hasbro would pay much attention, if any at all.

It didn't end up getting printed, but is all still available online without even having to resort to pirate torrents. So you might get away with something similar. I'd suggest that you make some effort to find owners though, and in the event that you don't, make it clear in some text added to a page that you make no claims to rights of it and will voluntarily cease and desist any distribution if approached by anyone with a legitimate claim.

Left wing politics can frequently end up neglecting the environment in favour of social programs or industrialisation as well.   

I personally think that taking care of the environment is important regardless of one's political orientation, and that in can be done within the framework of governments of all types, but that it also needs to be balanced with other concerns and issues.   I would certainly be interested in having a green party that pushed a pro-green agenda (without stooping to Greenpeace or Peta levels) without fiscal policy that is frequently terribly thought out and an anti-science agenda that would do far more harm than good.

Studio flats in the UK mean a single room roughly a couple of hundred square feet. And yes, you'll pay £800 a month for 200sq.ft in London.

“He wanted to play for Chelsea but he wanted to be clearly the first choice striker, which in a club of our dimension, it is very difficult to promise to a player.

“That reduced immediately his desire to come to us.

“Everton came in with an important offer. It is the reality of our club that we want to do things really well and to always be inside the rules (of the Financial Fair Play regulations).

“Financial Fair Play is always behind the thoughts of the Chelsea board and when you have the chance to create a positive impact in Financial Fair Play, Chelsea always analyse these situations.”

“The important thing is he is happy and things work out for him. He is a good kid,” added Mourinho.

“The only thing we can do is wish him well.”

There's a general rule that if they think you changed your name on a drunken whim and don't intend to use the name for all purposes, they'll ignore it.

The trademark bit seems to come up because, although your name can't infringe a trademark, you might be changing your name for some nefarious purpose. Maybe they think you're going to change your name to Tesco, open a bank account and commit some kind of corporate identity theft. It does seem a bit unnecessary.

Skywalker seems innocent enough, but they might reasonably wonder why her name is Laura Elizabeth Skywalker Matthews but she's signing L Skywalker.

Our chances of selling him are only getting slimmer in my opinion since he's not even being given chances in preseason to showcase his talent to other clubs. 

Meanwhile, we have Rodgers marginalizing someone who would offer a very formidable option for second keeper (better than most other clubs) who looks like we might not be able to sell simply because he wrote a pointed letter after he was loaned to Napoli out of the blue. I'm having trouble seeing eye-to-eye with Rodgers on this one.

He's a tosser. Just like Tevez.

Not liking a particular player for showing a total disrespect of your club doesn't make you a lesser fan you know.

I support Manchester City FC, not Yaya Toure FC.

Perhaps you should remember that?

You probably won't grasp that though, as you're likely one of those new foreign fans which hero worships every player above the club, and doesn't grasp the fact that players come and go. Ultimate loyalty for a supporter is to their club, and that's why Yaya has come in for so much flak, he's disrespected this club.

As I said, he will be remembered as an important part of our growth into a top side, but he won't be thought of in the same breath as the likes of Kompany and Zabaleta.

He's merely a gun for hire, a mercenary with no genuine affinity or loyalty to the club.

If they're smart enough to dress themselves then they'll probably realise you're calling them, which could result in your house being targeted with eggs and stones as they'll want the police to come again.

You could call your local youth club and ask if their detached group can come down to see what interests them, see if they can have a word as that is a nicer approach that the police.


In terms of the woman, I would report this to the police. Explain the situation and have it on record at least. This way if your dog ever does snap then you have a record of the abuse she is giving yourself/dogs so it may not go down the route of your dog getting destroyed. This is only if you're frightened of retaliation from the family. If you want to press the police to pursue a case then it would be out in the open, I however think there would be less chance of anything happening, compared to retaliation from the youths. 

With the kids, if you go out and explain your mothers situation they might have it in their hearts to move on. You can try that approach before calling a youth group or the police.

If you're saying it's his fault and his fault alone I kinda disagree. 
He had a solid chance at being chelsea's second option and with that comes a lot of playing time,
so you can perfectly argue that he had a good chance to get some solid playing time this time around.
But on the other hand it's hard to deny that it's extremely hard to get in chelsea's first squad if you still have to develop in certain areas. 
(unless your name is Eden Hazard and you're already proven in a league better than the belgian one)
The gap between our youth teams (who are doing well) and the actual first team is huge.
I read comments about his terrible attitude  and how he's not willing to fight for his spot e.t.c. but if you think back about when he first joined the team things were completely different.
I highly doubt he expected to start over his idol and i dont think he thought he was better than Torres at that stage of his career either. 
When you read interviews from him around that time he was always speaking about how he was hungry to improve and become a solid chelsea player.
Somehow that all changed, and although its' partly his attitude, I can't help but feeling that we should give the youth more chances in general (nothing comes for free of course)

It only said he didn't pass his medical and I'd assume since he has a pre existing condition that they didn't think he could make the cut because of that.

Suarez dropping back and creating really made the diamond tick, it gave him and sturridge more space. Lambert up there just makes up the numbers as opposed to really working in the formation.

And it also causes issues when we need to track back and defend down the flanks. With full backs and wingers ahead theres another layer, the fullback overlaps and the winger can pick up the run, and vice versa. When we have our wing back go forward, if our midfielders are occupied then it's on our center backs or anyone running back to pick them up.

I certainly hope so. He absolutely controlled the play when he was deeper in the previous game. When he moved forward in that game and in this game, it seemed like he had less of an impact. Didn't have as much time on the ball, and we couldn't take advantage of his passing range.

That said, I think it's a very good thing that he can also serve as backup to Oscar. It could have been because of the World Cup, but Oscar's drop in form also coincided with a complete lack of competition for his place as #10. Depending on how Rami and Van Ginkel play alongside Matic, he could be forced out of the side for long periods of time if he goes on a similarly shocking run. He'll have to work hard to keep his place, and I think that'll help him immensely.

Banning faith schools wouldn't solve this problem and banning them would mean closing lots of really good existing schools. 

Faith schools are well regulated, they have to cater to a mixed intake and teach the national curriculum, including evolution, comparative religion and sex education.

The reason these people wanted to use the plot of taking over the governorship of an existing school is that they would have been unable to set up a faith school. 

The issue here isn't religion, it would be perfectly possible to have a school that caters for Muslim, Hindu, Jewish..whatever children and also adheres to the national curriculum and is inclusive. The real issue here is how schools as a whole are run, Michael Gove's policy of 'free schools' and giving controlling powers to Parent-Governors is inevitably going to create situations where children aren't being taught properly. 

The problem here is the government putting people who are not qualified teachers in charge of deciding how schools teach. Whether those people are religious extremists or just misguided hippies who want to teach kids to make dream catchers all day is not the main issue, the main issue is that the government should recognise that teaching is a profession, schools are important public institutions and just like hospitals, or army bases, or fire stations, they can't be run by Joe Public as experiments, they need to be nationally regulated and staffed by trained professionals.

The Trial of a Time Lord - Part 1 (The Mysterious Planet, Part 1)

First broadcast: Saturday 6th September, 1986

The TARDIS is drawn to a space station where the Doctor is subjected to a Time Lord inquiry into his behaviour, presided over by an Inquisitor. The prosecuting counsel, the Valeyard, presents the first piece of his evidence, which consists of a recording played back on a screen linked to the Matrix. It concerns a visit by the Doctor and Peri to the desolate planet Ravolox, which turns out to be a future Earth, shifted light-years through space.



Writer: Robert Holmes

Director: Nicholas Mallett



After an 18-month production hiatus due to poor ratings, the series returned with this episode of ""The Trial of a Time Lord"". The whole season is titled as The Trial of a Time Lord, and is split into four segments. The segments are commonly referred to by their working titles but the season was broadcast as one fourteen-part story and the working titles did not appear on screen.



This story was the last complete Doctor Who story written by long term contributor Robert Holmes.

Joe Allen has been very poor.  He is tasked with controlling play in the midfield and has turned over the ball through bad touches or poor passes more than I can recall.  He is not good in a 4-4-2 diamond.  Bottom line...  I do not want to rely upon Allen to give us width in attack.  He needs to be part of a 3 man midfield or be left on the bench.  

Kelly is ensuring that we purchase a fullback this window.  With Johnson, Enrique, and Flanno as the only 3 FBs with any experience, Kelly has not played his way into contention for even a spot on the bench.  I think we are seeing the end for him as a Red.

Lambert needs to step it up.  He would be best played in a 4231 formation however, as his style doesn't seem to be suited to playing next to Studge.  Other than one nice bit of linkup play, he has been sub-par.  

Coates.    COATES!  He and Kolo and making sure that, despite turnovers galore, we have not conceded.

true,cjlennon8,null,null,"1. This season: how do you think it will go?
Even with the uncertainty over ownership this season should be an improvement for Villa, with the removal off the bad eggs in the coaching staff and the recruitment of Keane there is now hopefully decent management in place. On the playing staff side although for fans of other clubs our signings look very uninspiring they bring much needed experience and I feel Cole could be a key man in this villa team and possibly someone for those that play Fantasy Football should consider having as a cheap buy. I'd predict that we will probably finish around 10th-12th.

2. How will the team line up? (If you can give a possible line up like this example, then great):  
                            Guzan  
                  Okore - Vlarr - Clark  
Lowton - Westwood - Cole - Delph - Richardson  
                Agbonlahor - Weimann  

The line up will change with the return of Benteke &amp; Kozak from injury and Senderos may start over Clark. 

3. Which three players should other fans watch out for?

Jack Grealish - Local lad who went out on loan to Notts County last year and looks set to break into the first team this year. Has been playing left midfield during pre-season but my understanding is that he believes his future is at AM so can use this season to be the understudy to Cole.

Jores Okore - http://vimeo.com/53073475 this video is all you need to watch, to see why Villa fans are excited about him being in the side. Unfortunately was out all of last season injured but will be great to see him kick on and hopefully work along Vlarr to improve our ability to defend but also to play out from the back, Clark &amp; baker often look to hoof the ball down field rather than look for a shorter pass to help us retain possession.   

Joe Cole - It seems everyone thinks his best was a long time ago, but I think his move the Villa give him the platform he needs to show he still has it. At West Ham he was wasted out wide and he clearly doesn't have the legs to be a winger. But play him in the hole behind the strikers and I think he will control the midfield for Villa with his superior passing ability, his attacking flair should also see a lot more chances being created for the strikers.

&gt;Before the official team was announced, plans were presented by MLS to build a soccer stadium in [Flushing Meadows–Corona Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing_Meadows%E2%80%93Corona_Park)  in [Queens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens). However, due to opposition to building a stadium on park land as well as objections from the [New York Mets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets), who play nearby, the site lost favor once the new team was announced. The team came up with an alternate proposal to build the stadium in [the Bronx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx) adjacent to [Yankee Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee_Stadium) to be completed in 2018 at the earliest.  On April 21, 2014, the club confirmed that they would play their first season home games at Yankee Stadium, and that plans for a future stadium were in progress.

The problem was that it was liquid fuelled, so could be destroyed in silos by an attacker while still preparing to launch.  And nobody in the uk wanted missile silos nearby them.

We also had trouble making our own h-bombs. We were ok with a-bombs but British h-bombs never really worked.  So we secretly made really big a-bombs, blew one up as a test in the 50s, convincing/fooling the Americans we knew how to make h-bombs so they would share their (working) designs with us. This trick wasn't revealed until the 90s.

Incidentally the really big British a-bombs were unsafe when armed (they could accidentally go off if dropped or slammed). A safety mechanism was then used to stop them being armed accidentally - although it also made them virtually impossible to arm in a war situation too - although the RAF did manage to arm one by accident once.

&gt;she was pretty useless. Tagged along, and spouted her opinions when there was no point

Give us examples (preferably with episode name and a time stamp) so we can look at them again and consider your interpretation.  Also the characters growth may become much more obvious to you as you find many examples of something you don't like at the beginning of their run and very few towards the end.  It also makes it easier for others to give counter examples.

To be honest every time I've seen one of these posts with lots of ""always"" in it it has given me the impression that the poster made up their mind about who the character was in the first episode or two and didn't pay any attention to anything that contradicted their initial judgement (confirmation bias) and isn't really looking to understand the character better, just to validate their own opinion.  They aren't really invitations to a productive conversation.

To give you a solid example of something that contradicts your assertion that Amy was useless and spouted her opinion when there was no point:  Amy stopped the Doctor from killing the Star Whale in her second episode.

2. From a quick glance at a tube map I might add Camden/Kentish Town to your list, which is otherwise on the right track I'd say.  But I think £800 might be on the low side.  Probably quite a lot on the low side in fact, anywhere in those areas at that money is going to have 'issues'; if you're lucky, the only issue will be 'being microscopic' but even then... you could pay more.  With your wage I would say it would be very normal to spend more on rent, and you'd get somewhere siginificantly better, and not be impoverished.

 [**Number of guns per capita by country**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number%20of%20guns%20per%20capita%20by%20country): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;This is a list of countries by __guns per capita__ (number of privately owned small firearms divided by number of residents).    

&gt;Despite concerns that it contains systematic errors, the *[Small Arms Survey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Arms_Survey) 2007*,  provides an estimate of the total number of known civilian-owned guns in a country per 100 people of that country.

&gt;As some people may possess multiple firearms and in many countries such as Israel and Switzerland people may possess the guns for decades while the government technically owns the guns, this number does not necessarily represent the percentage of people who possess guns in each country.  Indeed, the errors in these numbers alter cross-country comparisons.

true,196884,null,null,"1st half : 442 diamond left too much in the flanks that jesus navas ran wild. Enrique was too high up (i suspect it is not his fault but BR's orders to ""provide width in the middle). Kelly is unsteady and very poor. Lambert + Studge as front 2 pair does *not* work -- they are playing in each other's spaces. Lambert often drop back to midfield as we are being overrun in the middle with Toure and Coates sitting too deep sometimes. Gerrard has a poor game.

2nd half : we switched around into (what I think) our probably standard formation of 4-2-3-1, with the ""2"" = Gerrard+Henderson, and the 3 Sterling(L) Coutinho(C) and Allen(R). Team is much better balanced, and studge is happier as the lone striker to roam. Coutinho also begin to find Sterling and Studge with his passes (because they play in different spaces), so have a better game. Allen is not impressing me -- I think his spot is under threat by Emre Can, who I think can play Allen's role with a lot more positivity.

Sterling is really really good.... 

Some comments on fringe young players :

Coates : neat, fairly disciplined. feels like he is playing for a spot in the squad
Kelly : caught watching the ball twice (once leading to a free header), bullied off ball too easily.
Robinson : tidy and composed, confident. If he keep this up, he might ""do a flanno"" this season.

edit : seems like a game that BR tried some interesting ideas on formation.  I suspect we will play like what we played in the 2nd half (I doubt he will try 442 diamond with lambert-studge again. Studge does not play well with a traditional strike partner).

He has a sensible head on his shoulders, and I think it would suit him nicely, as he has said, he isn't unfamiliar with it, and actively tries to lead the team anyway.",0,1406770298,null,0,false,0,cjclfjv,t3_2c75ph,t1_cjclfjv,t3_2c75ph,null,1434984152,3,false,SaintsFC,t5_2tboa,3

true,stop___grammar_time,silver,Silver,"&gt;Ninth non-Jeff called himself Jeff until he died, 

Eighth. The eighth Doctor chose to abandon the code of conduct and therefore the name, using the potion from the sisters to ensure that when he regenerated, his ninth body would not abide by code.

&gt;who does the counting?

Who sets the limit? It's a biological limit. A Time Lord body can regenerate 12 times and then dies on the 13th. At least around the time of the 5th Doctor the Time Lords invented a way to give a Time Lord a new set of regenerations, so they're able to bypass that limit. Also, going by that scene with the Master after that whole *End of Time* debacle,   a Time Lord can apparently choose not to regenerate so they can have a much shorter lifespan. 

Who keeps track of how many times he's regenerated? I'd imagine he does, essentially dying and coming back as another person has got to be pretty memorable.

Who assigns them numbers? The production team and the fanbase. In universe he doesn't go around saying ""I'm the #th Doctor"", he just says ""I'm the Doctor"".

&gt;did the Doctor entity decide to ""not count"" the ninth regeneration as a Doctor

Yes. He was one of his regenerations, but that regeneration was not ""The Doctor"". ",0,1406770311,null,0,false,0,cjclfsa,t3_2c0p4z,t1_cjclfsa,t1_cjcaqvf,null,1434984157,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

true,TheLastKhan,null,null,"That was really fun to watch! So many positives as well.

 Henderson was great, Gerrard looks like he's more comfortable in that position despite the mistake - his pass to Enrique was spectacular.

Coates was amazing in the first half, no so much in the second. Sakho came on and gave us much more assurance, can't wait to see him partner Lovren/Skrtle regularly this year! Sakho can't seem to judge his headers though which is a little worrying. And we definitely, definitely need some fullbacks.

Allen had a stinker, Lucas was solid, and Can is going to be a vital player for us. Coutinho was decent but had some poor touches. Sturridge wasn't great and the need for another striker hasn't been stronger. Rickie should've scored, he's playing an interesting role. Add the ever incredible Raheem Sterling and it was a great game for us. Let's hope we build on it!

But not best. (That would be full renewables, like Germany.)

All I'm going to say about defense was that Clichy has played surprisingly well at RB, but I'm going to be happy when Zabaleta, Kompany, and Demichelis are back on the pitch. 

Midfield looked decent. We were strong on the wings but not as great through the middle. Navas has been great in each game he's played and I think Sinclair has made a strong case to stick around and get some time at LW.

I missed a lot of Dzeko's performance, but I love the run of form Jovetic is in. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that he'll stay decently healthy and we'll get to see some amazing stuff when he gets to link up with Aguero, Silva, and Nasri.

Every time Iheanacho gets the ball I look for something exciting to happen. The kid has all the confidence in the world. The way he stepped up and nailed his penalty was awesome. I'm really interested in what the coaches have planned for his development.

Lastly, what the fuck happened on those penalties? Kolarov looked great on the ones he took early this preseason and tonight he looked like Fernando Torres trying to score a sitter. I don't think Yaya missed a single one last season, yet today he just went up and slapped it with his purse. I can only assume he'll be better once he gets used to playing again. Not much to say about Navas. I doubt in a real game position he'll be called upon to take a penalty. At least he stepped up with some confidence, put his leg through it, and forced a save.

Oh right some blokes invested 200,000 pounds (in today's money) and you got promoted and won the league in subsequent years! In addition your sugar daddy Davies then built you a brand new 80,000 capacity stadium for 6,000,000 pounds (in today's money) from his own pocket! The value of these investments is far more than what it is in today's money. When we got our funding the average value of teams was far more than back in the early 1900s. We got a stadium and funding equivalent to the top teams they got a stadium and funding far beyond what anyone else had at the time. 

Also didn't we have Kompany, Zabaleta, Hart, and others before we were taken over? Seems like we were doing quite well without the millions. 

Also tell them that we have value in our fans more than anything. This was a club that was scraping out of the third division and averaging 28,000 fans a game while out neighbors were having fun winning the CL. If they have the fucking audacity to think all this club is, is a few bought titles then there is no hope for them. 

Manchester City won the league twice and the UEFA Cup without the money Liverpool and United had. We were able to keep great players like Kinkladze even when we fell out of the top division.

I mean, it seems like what you're saying is that we should stop buying players like Markovic low, who have massive up sides. That's stupid, teams like Chelsea can do both- buy stars and also afford to play the buy low sell high game. We can't do that, we need to buy young players and roll the dice.

2. Exams at Edinburgh uni run form May through June, I had mine at the start of May so I have a 5 month summer holiday. You will have a 3 month summer at the very least.

3. If you live in morningside there will be almost no travel cost unless you get a bus into town instead of walking/cycling. I spend about £20 a week on food but that's just me. I dunno what the average is but there's tesco and some green grocers/butchers close by so it's no more expensive than any other place.I advise looking for an all student flat because you will be exempt from council tax.

4. Sorry I have an amazing flat already ;P 

5. Scottish so I dunno.

6. There are loads of cafes/restaurants/retail places so it's pretty easy to get a part time job. Being a touristy place means certain places are always busy so the casual job market isn't stagnant. I can't say if it will affect your grades or not because that is completely dependant on how much effort you are actually willing to put in. If you wanna work hard you'll be fine, if you wanna be lazy and spend a lot of free time doing nothing then your grades will be affected but that's up to you, not a part time job.

true,iamaravind,lfc12,,"was at the game today. and what a spectacle for my first LFC match. the bar across the stadium was filled with a sea of Red, many a song was sung and chanted, and at one point the crowd outside got so big in support, that the police had to escort us to the stadium whilst waving a giant flag to try and disperse us from the junction in front of the bar. Any opposing Manc that we encounted otw, whether he was sporting a City or United kit was jeered, a personal highlight lol. It was like a Red Rebellion in the Bronx.

anyway to the match, we put out a competitive team and played well to get the win. were a couple of close calls in the first half, but we managed to hold them scoreless. That 4-4-2 diamond just did not work as well this time around, and only after Sterling's introduction and the switch to 4-3-3 did we start to get on the front foot more. Jovetic's first goal was a stroke of fortune for them, but Henderson's equalizer was well placed and came from a Sturridge ""assist"". He miss-hit the ball again lol just like against Olympiakos, a rather amusing trend.

City did well with the second goal, and have to admit my heart almost gave way a couple of times after that, as we made some careless errors that almost handed them the game. Johnson, in particular was not looking sharp, and one careless play by him almost gave City their third goal. Emre Can's introduction though swung the momentum in our favour, as did Jovetic's withdrawal. Sterling finished off a move well to get the equaliser, and Mignolet came through on penalties to give us the win.

Best players on the park as I saw it were Coates, who was simply outstanding in defense, made some crucial interceptions and looks to be growing with confidence in every game. Henderson, who was voted man of the match, and Sterling also gave their usual high performance games, while Emre Can did well too after his introduction.

Johnson was again not at his best, and the pick of the worst. Going into the new season, I think we'll be better off not having as a guaranteed started, but using him in rotation with Flanagan. Keeps him fresh, and on his toes. Coutinho while solid otherwise, did miss a few good chances with bad finishing, while Lambert other then a good header in the first half, was nonexistent in attack. 

Still though we played well against Premier League opposition, had good movement with the ball, were solid in defence, and deadly on the counter.

However, the formation we were playing in the first half, our fullbacks were always going to struggle. When Gerrard drops deep and the fullbacks attack, it's up to the centre backs and midfielders to cover. Someone made a great point that the reason Johnson was so good before was because we had players like Mascherano and Alonso sitting deep to cover for him. We don't have that anymore - Stevie didn't cover for the fullbacks once today, nor did Hendo. Allen did a couple times but he was terrible overall. I think once Stevie plays in that area with a proper centre back pairing, our fullbacks won't be as exposed.

This question comes up a lot, this is a response I had to a similar question [apparently 6 months](http://www.reddit.com/r/MotoUK/comments/1vu7mj/camera_recommendations/cew1krw) ago.

What I would has changed since then is specifically the quality between the latest Drift and GoPro models.

Drift released the Ghost S, a smaller form factor Ghost HD with a doubled FPS achieving 1080p 60 FPS which rivaled GoPro's Hero3+ Black.

I don't believe Contour have kept up with Drift and GoPro in their revised 1080p@60fps models, I don't consider this extremely important though and would advise at least considering the older / cheaper models.

I use mine for insurance purposes, it's a small investment for the time and money at risk with dealing with an insurance claim. It also captures some [nice moments too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dadcuA0vAiw), and is an easy way for somebody to open an interesting conversation with you.

For reference, this is a true [720p@60FPS video](http://gfycat.com/HardCheeryBengaltiger) from a few days back, testing Gfycat. Recording at that FPS with the detail of their branded 1080p might be nice.

You then watch your future self walk into a convenience store, buy a lottery ticket, and win (you didn't catch the numbers). Future you runs off very happy.

So what do you do then? Well, if you live in a universe like Doctor Who where time CAN change, but has a certain resistance, then as soon as you start time traveling, you make sure to wear dumb T-Shirts. You also pinch yourself painfully if you ever encounter yourself from the past. Why? Because you want to win the lottery. 

Time Travel changes how probability works. ""Foreknowledge"" means the game suddenly becomes either protecting or fighting against timelines you either like or don't like. Here's the important part; it means EVERYTHING IN THAT TIMELINE IS CORRELATED TO YOU.

You know this too. The second you realized you were that future you you saw, you would be pinching yourself very hard, because you want to PROTECT that timeline. You don't want to ""argue with history"".

The BBC pays a lump sum every year of several million pounds, in return for which it gets a blanket licence to play any music which has been officially made available in the UK. It does this because otherwise keeping track of royalties to be paid would be a nightmare -- the BBC has 8 TV channels, 10 national radio stations and over 30 regional radio stations. 

ITV and most large commercial radio operators have a similar arrangement with MCPS (the body that manages music royalty payments in the UK).

true,Inkmonkey1,null,null,"That's a very good point. I think there's also an aspect from outside the game of football itself that's handy to consider, too. Namely, cultural shift. 

The era of the player as a year-round media commodity and pseudo-rockstar is what a significant portion (and, to advertisers in general THE most significant portion) of today's audience have grown up with. 

As a result, they perceive more players as ""marquee"" than, say, the generation that grew up watching Hansen. 

In 2014 any one of dozens of European league players are perceived as elite superstars both by adoring fans and a celebrity-culture driven press. 

Back in the late 70s a negligible section of the buying public even within England were even vaguely interested in what Keegan had to say about anything, and he was European Footballer of the Year. These days, Ronaldo winks in Spain and knickers drop in China.

A couple of generations ago, there wasn't half as much expectation from the majority of consumers that their team would pick up a minimum of one elite-level player per transfer window. They didn't really even consider that so many could actually exist at once. 

But as the media shifted to a 24-hour revolving cycle, it needed stuff to fill the air. Over time, players have gone from pieces of a team on a field (with occasional notable exceptions) to being minor (sometimes major) celebrities in their own rights--largely to cater to an increasingly media-dependent generation. 

So, a less demanding public in the 70s and 80s resulted in a smaller supply of perceived marquee players. 

The current generation, on the other hand, have been led to believe that just about anyone who shows a season of promise and is near a fashionable side is the next coming of Pele and is worth a minimum of 50 million. 

Demand is massive, supply isn't, really, much more than it used to be (taking into account the increasing quality of players overall as facilities and so on improve). But, as Weller pointed out, the public gets what the public wants. 

Unfortunately, at present, the public seems to believe that genuine best-of-breed players occur at a rate far in excess of actual reality. 

tl:dr there are massive value perception differences between the public of the 70s and 80s and the public of the 21st century.

Still holding off on ""A Remorseful Day"" because I know what's coming. The last several episodes have each ended in a manner that would have been a ""happy ending"" of sorts for Morse. 

In ""Death is Now My Neighbour"", it basically ended with Morse, Lewis, and Adele Cecil in the pub, and Morse finally reveals his first name. It was an ending that would have left us with him in a happy place, with Morse fairly content with life -- still a Chief Inspector, Lewis as his Second, and a female finally in his life.

In ""The Wench is Dead"", the episode ends with Morse possibly taking early retirement. No Lewis in sight (he's off taking his Inspector's exams) but we know Adele is still around. It was another ambiguous ending that would have left the character ""in place"".

Knowing what's coming; well, I appreciate that they are doing what they did. The series was ending, and they ended it.

Bentaleb might not have the pace of either one, but god does he have an incredible footballing brain. At his age, for the position he plays, considering his ball distribution's pretty good, he's an incredible talent.

true,JerkDaniels,lfc12,,"In order of the most impressed and why:

1). Emre Can - He's showing all of the poise and confidence of a seasoned pro and he's still young. Very strong on the ball, very technically sound; well beyond his years. 

2). Coates - He seems a step quicker in his decision making this preseason and I would only imagine that's due to getting games last year on loan. Aside from [this](http://youtu.be/9rlEg_GOyiA) I think a majority of us had written him off as another young center-back casualty due to the inherent lack of rotation at the position. He's making a strong case to be a squad player, in my opinion. 

3). Raheem - He's slowly but surely moving into place as the EPL's top young talent. We've seen him go through rough patches, we've given Brendan his plaudits on his [man management](http://youtu.be/wujTSELwsPA), but Raheem is the one on the pitch. He's come leaps and bounds since this time last year. He looks to be continuing this upward trajectory. His finishing is getting far better. Very exciting to watch in the red shirt for us (behind Coates based on the fact that I'm truly not surprised by how good he's coming along). 

4) Coutinho/Hendo - I'm putting them both here because I think Brendan has marked both of them as key contributors in replacing Luis' goals and I can see them working hard on their attacking play. Hendo is making huge strides every year. This year has to be huge for him, and I think he's his own biggest critic. Hendo is always in his head so I can see a few goals really kicking him on. Cou will be the same. They both lack that end product with their finishing, but if/when it comes...goals from midfield.

5) Stevie G (Honorable mention) - He's lost out on the title, disastrous showing at he WC, hung up his boots for England, and watched Luis go onto greener pastures. He's back putting in doubles less than a month after the WC; working through what he's said is his darkest time. As much as this is a game, it's a job and it's hard to work when you're mentally jaded. Props to the skipper, and I loved the boldness in his [interview](http://youtu.be/7OsWbkVdZUA). 

Side note:

I'd like to see more of Lazar (which will come with time), looking forward to Lallana's return to action. I think Lucas is worth keeping and needs to redefine his role. Glen has put us on the line a few too many times in recent games. Joe Allen looks a little off. Jordon Ibe is almost there; lacking a little sharpness in the final third but coming along good.

true,Chazwatti,lfc68,,"Raheem Sterling is an absolute gem. Obviously we all know about  him and there has been hype for some time/some great performances last year but I have to stop and think how young he is on a frequent basis now. Having played football myself at a reasonably high level until the age of about 22 (shit knees) I cannot stress how much he impresses me. He's a year younger than Barkley, arguably has more impact already and is more consistent.

His ability to pick up the ball, accelerate quickly over the first 5 to 10 yards and then get his head up is going to be vital to how we play for years to come and very difficult to come by. His awareness seems to have not only improved but doubled in about 12 months and, best of all, his character/attitude on the pitch is now exemplary. These are mental aspects of the game which usually develop more slowly in these early years but Raheem just seems to be maturing at a fantastic rate, his movement really is quite intelligent at times. 

Rodgers has worked absolute miracles with the boy and seems to have a real connection with him. If there is one player I am excited about watching over the next few year it's him by a mile, the boy can be as good as he wants and, if he keeps up his current work-rate/professionalism, we could have something very VERY special on our hands.

That's not a very BR player. That's kinda why both he and Skrtel was so marginalized when BR first came. BR wanted composed defenders that can play on the ground, that can win back the ball without conceding needless FKs, throws or corners and who take fewer risks.

Of course as his system slowly transformed from the patient-game to the dynamic counter it became clear our defense would be frequently undermanned and probably could use a few more risk takers. Hence Skrtel's resurgence, unfortunately that's also when Coates was out injured.

Coates was brilliant last night (for me at least) and can be useful but he is basically the back-up Skrtel. And with Lovren with us now, himself a hybrid ball-playing defender with enough speed to take a few more risks Skrtel might just end up being his back-up.

At 23 Coates is right in the sweet spot with our squad and can probably still turn things around. I don't see him getting any game time this season though.
