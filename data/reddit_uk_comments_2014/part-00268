Alien Act 1705
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
The Alien Act was a law passed by the Parliament of England in 1705, as a response to the Parliament of Scotland's Act of Security of 1704, which in turn was partially a response to the English Act of Settlement 1701.

The Alien Act provided that Scottish nationals in England were to be treated as aliens (foreign nationals), and estates held by Scots would be treated as alien property,[1] making inheritance much less certain. It also included an embargo on the import of Scottish products into England and English colonies – about half of Scotland's trade, covering goods such as linen, cattle and coal.[2]

The Act contained a provision that it would be suspended if the Scots entered into negotiations regarding a proposed union of the parliaments of Scotland and England. Combined with English financial offers to refund Scottish losses on the Darien scheme, the Act achieved its aim, leading to the Acts of Union 1707 uniting the two countries as the Kingdom of Great Britain.",0,1410462443,null,0,false,0,ckfkr62,t3_2g3x12,t1_ckfkr62,t1_ckff6gt,null,1427067936,-5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-5

&gt; Norway's income tax on oil and gas profits has two components: A 28 percent tax on profits (the same income tax charged on all businesses in Norway), and a special 50 percent tax on profits from offshore oil and gas production, for a total tax of 78 percent. (All of Norway's oil and gas production comes from offshore federal leases.) For example, the owners of gasoline stations and the two refineries in Norway pay just the 28 percent tax rate, even if they are owned by an offshore oil and gas producer - the profits are counted separately.

&gt; ""It's stable, and still they earn money,"" said an official with the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, explaining that companies continue bidding on Norwegian oil and gas leases, despite the substantial tax bite.

Then why are you voting for a proposition that even you know is a massive tissue of lies? 

The SNP are promising everybody will be *better* off and spouting out numbers of how much extra money every family will get under independence.

How can you vote for a proposition which treats us with such utter contempt?

I understand why you want an end to FPTP. I have mixed feelings - I think it's probably a sign of the times that we vote for parties and not individuals, so I'd like to see all of the UK move to our clearly superior system with lists etc.

But leaving the UK just to get that is incredibly expensive.

What I do want to say though is at least you are being honest about it. Your views are no less or more valid than mine. 

What I don't like is the morons yelling and screaming and trying to shout over the top of everybody else about illegal wars, foodbanks, tories and the NHS.

I've never liked the ""Britnat"" style unionists. I've never liked the Settler Watch bigots. But over the past few years a whole new group of yes supporting morons has appeared and I'm sorry to say that I have nothing but contempt and anger for a large number of people in Scotland who are acting as anti-democratically as they possibly can in their selfish attempts to drown everybody else out.

If the vote goes for yes it will signal the start of an enormous period of discontent across Scotland. Long before 2016 we'll be told to hate the rUK because they won't give us the currency union out of spite. A race to the bottom in corporation tax while companies domicile elsewhere won't help us. There is nothing we can do in the short term to increase corporation tax receipts - only in the long term and there are no plans to do so. 

If the vote goes 51%/49% then we'll have 51% of the 85% that voted bitterly disappointed in how it turned out. And we'll have everybody else bitter at the people who voted yes.

The worst of it is that if the vote goes to a no we'll still get nearly as many people bitterly disappointed at how it goes.

If only we could harness this energy across the whole of the UK and demand that party funding is gutted and Scotland's AMS system imposed right across the UK we might seem some real good.

We might even get the Federal UK that we both want.

Rent a castle (yes, an actual castle, with battlements etc - perhaps even a moat) from the Landmark Trust, which is a charity that maintains historic buildings as holiday cottages. Some are expensive, others quite reasonable. Nearby should be some of; moorlands, mountains, ancient woods, unspoiled country villages with good pub food, a small cathedral city, a country market town with a good selection of second-hand bookshops, a venue on the mid-sized gig circuit.

Bring or otherwise obtain a couple of good dogs, perhaps a spaniel and a retriever. An open fire looks better with a couple of dogs next to it.

Drink: bottled beer (I like London Pride), Pimms, some single malt (Laphroiag, Talisker or Lagavulin for me).

Food: Get this locally, take your time shopping, use small specialists and ask for recommendations.

Music: Each guest should bring an instrument. Electric players should bring small amps. Drummers: no need for more than a small jazz kit. Record everything.

Movie night: bring or rent a video projector. Most castles have a big wall that makes a good screen, especially if you hang a bedsheet on it. Drinks and snacks under the stars.

Long walks across rough terrain. It's fun to let the dogs lead the way rather than have a prepared route.

Nights out: At least a quick drink in the nearest local every so often. Try to find an open mic night, astound the locals with your skills.

A trip to the seaside: Take one day to sit around on a beach eating fish and chips and mooching about.

A gig: there's always a world-class act performing somewhere within an hour's drive of most places, most weeks. Check NME or the journal for your genre of choice.

A day clay pigeon shooting. One of the few activities I reluctantly admit is better practiced when sober. Enormously good fun blasting away at the skies and no ethical problems for any vegetarians etc in the group.

Northern Ireland is at the very centre of all that power, as the NI Green Party head put it ""we're sitting on a Saudi Arabia of renewable energy"".  So we do just add our own ample resources to the Eire-Alba Alliance.

Also there's the fact that for Ireland and Scotland to have optimum relations then NI has to be involved.  Scots and Irish are Goidelic, the western Celts, so we're part of the same cultural and language group there.  Then there's the shared history even before the plantation.  Dal Riata, the kingdom that would eventually form Scotland, was founded by Irish raiders from Antrim.  The Gallowglass originally came to Ireland from Scotland.  And then after that the Scottish MacDonnells settled in Antrim, and Edward Bruce was declared High King of Ireland.

Essentially NI can't be left out of Scotland-Ireland political union, besides which it would be an excellent middle-ground for our political divides over here.  We're with the Republic, ""Hurray!"" say the Nationalists.  We're also with Scotland, ""Hurray!"" say the Loyalists.

Your in-laws are, ultimately, in a bad financial position for people of that age and they need to focus on solving the problem rather than shifting the liability forward. If they want to have assets left over for their family they need to get rid of the debt, not create more. Downsizing is almost always the proper solution to problems that people consider Equity Release for and your in-laws are very big contenders for it in my opinion. If they are hell bent on Equity Release then they need to consult an independent mortgage broker, not try and find products on the internet.

Other than that they suffer the same problem as the DUP.

The PUP is essentially the Sinn Fein of Unionism. Not in their policies but the fact they are strongly linked to paramilitaries. Half my reason for not voting for Sinn Fein is due to their links with paramilitaries. Aside from that the party is made up of MORE RELIGIOUS FUCKWITS.

And the UUP are just a smaller PUP? 

As for the alliance party I don't even consider them unionists as many on here seem to. Due to the fact Anna Lo and probably many others class themselves as nationalists.

Now all I really want is to stop working for other people, buy a little place of my own, and have a huge family of pussycats. Plans are being made.

Oh and I'd like to come off the anxiety pills, but that can happen after I have had some CBT.

I guess I'd also like to earn enough to travel a bit more plus see my mum more too. She's 60 now and she ain't gonna be around forever. I'm seeing her next week as it happens :)

I'd like things to stop being so mediocre and humdrum really, so now I have to make that happen. Today I've discussed going to a mate's wedding in Malaysia next August and I would really like to make that happen as I want to see them get hitched.

Within Scotland, this has been about the least-nationalist nationalist movement possible, which suits me fine.

Anyways, to answer your question, I think England should skip the devolution thing, form themselves a 'Yes'-style movement and go full steam ahead for full independence from Westminster.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Ireland post independence implemented Protectionism and isolated itself from the economic boom. 

Very true. 

&gt; Ireland had a better economy in the 1890s than the 1950s

Laughably false. 

Mistakes were made post-independence, though it has to be remembered that Ireland had no industrial base whatsoever and was already very underdeveloped as a result of British rule. The economy did improve after independence and real development began to happen for the very first time, not as much as it should have true. 

Certainly, long-term, independence proved wonderful for Ireland. It was the poorest part of the UK (quite probably) and is now wealthier than the UK. There's no reason why Scotland and Wales couldn't achieve better. They're already very developed.   

This is beside the point anyway, independent Scotland would be much more likely to look at Ireland's present position rather than De Valera's economic policies. 

&gt; Now Northern Irelands economy is growing faster than the republics

&gt; The Alien Act provided that Scottish nationals in England were to be treated as aliens (foreign nationals), and estates held by Scots would be treated as alien property,[1] making inheritance much less certain. It also included an embargo on the import of Scottish products into England and English colonies – about half of Scotland's trade, covering goods such as linen, cattle and coal.[2]
&gt; The Act contained a provision that it would be suspended **if the Scots entered into negotiations regarding a proposed union of the parliaments** of Scotland and England. Combined with English financial offers to refund Scottish losses on the Darien scheme, the Act achieved its aim, leading to the Acts of Union 1707 uniting the two countries as the Kingdom of Great Britain.

true,greenbyte,null,null,"&gt; This is the main reason why Salmond expecting an indepent Scotland reliant on an ever more difficult and expensive revenue source is financial suicide.

Even when oil is expensive to extract, that means income and jobs for people working on it. On the downside, there will be less of a surplus which can be funneled into meaningful social expenses.

&gt; Scotland may end up with 10 years of relative wealth but that will sharply vanish as the big oil companies give up attempting to extract it. 

This is true. But at the same time, UK will have a **big** problem because it has to import the oil it needs, and this inevitably leads to a huge trade deficit and a debt crisis. Rising costs of imported fossil fuels are to a significant part what caused the deficit in Greece and Ukraine, for example. Similarly, the fact that Egypt has changed from an energy exporter to a energy importer means a lot of trouble, and it will be no different for rUK.

Also, expensive energy leads to financial instability, because it stifles growth, and that means not all companies can pay their debts, which leads to widespread failure of credits which are based on unrealistic growth projections.

Or to put it in other words, central banks lend money for credits people and companies cannot really pay back, in order to buy fossil energy which we cannot afford any more. Financial and energetic lack of sustainability meet here.

It is not unsustainable to use the oil. It is unsustainable to do nothing to end that dependency ASAP.

I don't she why it would be safer for Scotland to stay part of the union. At least, they are moving in the right direction, while UK does not move at all.

Nuclear covers less than 2 % of the worldwide consumption of primary energy, and in my point of view is to risky and expensive to use.

Furthermore, the most dangerous issue is a possible future lack of fuels. This can be countered by rail transport and ramping up public transport, building trolley buses and so on, but the UK government does nothing of that. Therefore, it is unsafe to stay with the union.

true,hexanaticious,wardr,Hurt,"Here's the thing for me at least. I thought RTD did some very good seasons, but some of the episodes I disliked most were ones he wrote. Really looking back, somewhere between a third and half the episodes he wrote were some of the worst episodes in my mind. 

Moffat writes episodes like a big blockbuster movie, like he's some kind of mash up between J.J Abrams and Michael Bay. If I were to describe my opinion on RTD, he's somewhere around Spielberg or George Lucas, in that he can do amazing things, but he can also do terrible things when left unchecked.

Having said that, I think the reason the series under RTD worked was because he trusted the writers and built his episodes as the buffers between, or somehow was more in touch with what they wanted to do and what they accomplished. His episodes had characters plot flow between them, and they felt like they were one next to the other, though there were times where so many 'normal' things had clearly been happening off screen.

Moffat went backwards in that regard, I think he's somewhat of a control freak, or else unable to manage the other writers, because it seems like unless it's big character development not just on screen, but shoved in your face, then it doesn't happen, and without a super back to back re watch, it seems like (excluding a few cases) character development is almost banned in other writer's episodes during a season, with the only interaction being the finale referencing the drama of other writer's episodes. More or less again, it seems almost like Moffat doesn't trust the writers to know what the other writers are doing, or something else is going on. The fact that Curse of the Black Spot and Night Terrors have their places in season switched somewhat reinforces character development for writers other then Moffat is lacking. 

I'm not a huge Moffat fan by any means, I liked the episodes he wrote from before he took over because it was the doctor playing the Big Damn Hero. For a while it was fun and always unexpected when something that could be seen as some of the darkest episodes would manage to pull off a happy ending. He somewhat kept that up, and like RTD, his first season as show runner stood somewhat well, if not over the top instead of Dramatic. 

Now as for RTD, the guy was good at writing the big plot and keeping the episodes connected. He could keep you on the edge of your seat waiting for the next episode to air. After the first season though, he demonstrated he sucked at actually figuring out how to get out of the corners he wrote himself into. Season 2, Season 3, not counting the issues in Torchwood. He can write good drama, make the characters people you care about and feel for when they're broken down, but he can be terrible at living up to the expectations he creates. 

Moffat's been the opposite for the big reveal, he doesn't really do much to keep you waiting on the edge of your seat since he shoves it in your face, while sneaking little hints in. Likewise while you can feel for his characters, they are shallow and fall into patterns where you could switch one for another along the roles of Doctor(Big Damn Hero), Female Companion(Action Girl, Usually Flirty, Sees Doctor as love interest while having other interest), Male Companion(Flawed, Broken and willing to be put down, Slowly becomes a hero type, usually comic relief). More or less he's borrowed from RTD in having The doctor, Rose, and Mickey, which you can almost exactly apply to Amy and Rory, or Clara and Pink from what we've seen at least. 

So Moffat's not really any worse than RTD in my book, but while I think the series Producer should be a writer, I don't think they should be allowed to write more than one or two episodes to a season since I think that's where the problems are coming from, they write too much themselves and run out of good ideas or the variety that the show needs, while at the same time limiting the other writers of the season to more or less be a writer of the week.

Certainly Salmond has been pushing the anti-austerity argument despite the fact the UK is now recovering extremely fast.   What happens when the oil runs out in 30-45 years and Scotland's economy is forced to transform?  The UK would have no controls over whether the transition to a different economic path has been completed successfully.  For parity what happens if the UK goes into recession in the future and Scotland doesn't because our economies have become so different?  Do we reduce the value of Scottish goods or leave the value of UK goods at prices that damage our exports?

1) In the last election in Scotland, 878,326 voters voted for the Coalition (LD &amp; Conservatives combined). This is around 35% of the Scottish electorate. While a minority, its hardly insignificant.

2) Throughout the Labour Government, Scotland voted hugely in favour of the Government through three General Elections between 1997 up until 2005. 

3) The last three Prime Ministers have been either Scottish or of Scottish descent (Cameron, Brown, Blair). The last two chancellors prior to the current one have been Scottish (Darling, Brown). 

Given that these are the two most important roles in Governments in the UK Govt, and that only one name (Osbourne) is not Scottish or Scottish descent is telling. (1/6).

Scotland has been very well represented in all elections, despite having a fraction of England's population.

The democratic process has been overwhelmingly representative for Scotland.

Scotland has every right to vote to seek its own destiny, but lets not pretend that there is some sort of political repression at play.

These are attached to people who are already spying on you. At the very least it means they can't make shit up.

Well when it comes to shoplifting everyone is, well not everyone people are profiled on how they look.

* The unofficial (not publicly sanctioned) **person** spying on you part.

You need a public licence to look at things in public? If he was following you into your home or snooping through your blinds

* The for ~~public good~~ protect corporate profits part.

You know some times these things can intersect. Having these facilities safe from crime makes them more attractive to vendors, which means more jobs, more money and more taxes.

* The seeming misuse of a ""community safety"" grant part.

On the one hand yeah OK, on the other has this money not been set aside to prevent crime and catch criminals? Whether its the best way to do so is questionable.

* The severity of vulnerability and exposure to blackmail part.

Like normal cctv

* The no apparent oversight on captured footage part

Like normal cctv

&gt;I'm all for businesses being able to deter and stop shoplifters but at what cost? I don't think the public should be paying for their profit maximizing equipment. I don't think that corporations should have all that power over us. 

Yeah we shouldn't be giving money to specific businesses, but there is nothing stopping you from going to a different shopping centre, they don't have control over you.

I don't think the scenario you described would be of any special risk from these particular devices, not with the extent digital cameras are available.

It will get us Questioning... 

if Scottish Independence is good...hey, that could work in NI. (I don't think Irish Nationalists will like that, U.K Nationalists won't like that either) The Scottish flag will then be hated by both ""loyalists/Nationalists"" (same thing, different fleg..whatever you choose to call them)

  



Leads to...

Independence for N.I is an interesting concept.  As a person who likes N.I being in the U.K. (spelt u-n-i-o-n-i-s-t), N.I independence is a second option, a very close second.

* Can't see an independent N.I happening anytime soon. 

Though I would probably welcome it. Smaller governance would give us more control. A 2 million people country, right at a doorway of Europe, could be very good location for international businesses. Like a mini European Hong Kong.

* Can't see a union with ROI happening for at least 200-300 years. 

Can't imagine how changing loyalties and nationalist tendencies will help. There would be chaos if it was forced and if you look at civil wars...those things escalate quickly and whole countries can be totally destroyed pretty quickly. 


   

    



   
TL;DR



The flegs are just an emblem. The Scottish fleg could be hated by **U.K Nationalists &amp; Irish Loyalists**™ ® ©... depends on the message the emblem projects to them....if that message is convenient or disruptive to their agenda.

The fact it was bought by the royals and owned by them for a long time?  

&gt; So it's short sighted to think that we can get more out of the Royal Collection by becoming a republic and still calling it Royal.

So what you're saying is the 'royal brand', so to speak, has no affect on tourism? You're kind of undermining your own argument there. 

&gt; Buckingham Palace wouldn't turn into a full art museum ... Windsor castle would probably be the museum castle for the Windsor family.

&gt;I had no idea that City was on the rise when I started watching. 

In February 2013 we were defending Premier League champions.

We weren't even on the rise, we were right at the top of the sport domestically. So I'm sorry, but that really doesn't wash mate.

The biggest cardinal sin you can make as a fan is to have been into a sport for a while, and then decided you want to support one of the new powerhouses of said sport - especially if you took no notice of them before they became a powerhouse.

But if football is a sport you've only picked up recently, then that's more understandable. People are drawn to the attractive and glamorous sides, and that's all good and well, but don't try to pretend the said success and glamour wasn't a factor in your 'choice', it's wholly insincere.

One thing which is a big no-no as a new supporter abroad is something like this:

&gt;I'm the type who goes all in when something pulls at the heartstrings. Man City for life. Also, the 1996 ""dont look back in Anger"" song from the Oasis when City was relagated, which was posted in another thread damn near brought a tear to my eye.

Do you really mean that? Really? Because that just seems particularly bizarre to me, things like that come across as insincere, and a deliberate and calculated attempt to ingratiate yourself to people who truly identify which such feelings.

Couldn't help but cringe when i read that in all honesty.

As other people have said, the true test of your motives for choosing City will only be tested and emerge once we go through a period of drought or failure.

Knowing how well equipped we are now, that's unlikely to ever happen, certainly not in the manner we were once accustomed to.

And maybe that's why you chose us, we were a sound bet so to speak.

All I know is that it's part of the human condition to seek to belong, and as long as you're not the archetypal ungracious arrogant gloryhunter who gloats about the success of City to other football fans, and respects our culture and heritage (and what it means to the core support), then you'll be welcomed with open arms.

Otherwise there are always more generic and plastic top sides you could choose as an alternative if it's merely reflective glory from trophies that you're after, we're fighting to retain our character and refrain from becoming such a club, and we need everyone pulling in the same direction.

Thats comforting, but as far as I can see there are no free market parties in Scotland. You have the SNP, Labour and the Lib Dems who frankly are all three different shades of red, and *in this specific scenario*, completely the worst kind of economic policies that Scotland should be embracing.

It's literally like taking a feather duster to a gun fight.

Scotland needs to show that its open for business, ready to engage with the world and be a nation that people want to do business with. I don't think you need to be corporate whores to achieve this. Just have some simple deregulation policies. You don't need to become a tax haven, but just show people that their money is safe in Scotland.

However, at present I can't help but think this is going to be a disaster with SNP at the helm.

That said, if Scotland is able to get the SNP out of power asap, I see huge potential. I think there will be a lot of turbulence in Europe starting around halfway through 2015. If Scotland has some sensible tax policies which enable a Hong Kong style Sterlingisation policy, it will be able to really capitalise on its freedom from the UK and the EU and become a safe haven for capital fleeing Europe.

Surely it doesn't make much business sense even in the UK to just absorb higher costs when every other company would spin off a Scottish loss making subsidiary?

Because they're a national UK company and offer the same price in all their shops.

They're being honest about the fact it costs more to bring goods up to Scotland (and particularly once you get beyond the central belt).

They're not alone in saying this;

&gt; If we were no longer to operate in one state with one market and – broadly – one set of rules, our business model would inevitably become more complex. We would have to reflect our cost to operate here.

&gt; This is not an argument for or against independence, it is simply an honest recognition of the costs that change could bring. For us the customer is always right and this important decision is in their hands

Independence won't fix tax avoidence. I am well aware the problem goes beyond Scotland. 
Tax avoidance, a banking sector capable of bankrupting the country are consequences of globalization that our existing political systems are unable to handle. 

Tackling global problems, achieving some form of democracy in an age of international corporations, will be one of the main issues of this generation. We will need to redesign our political structures and how they interact. Subsidiarity, federalism will be key.

And UK is not capable of being involved in this. 
At the center there is an ideological incompatibility between subsidiarity and the main tenet of unionism, Westminster must be sovereign.  Three years into the meat of the independence debate and MPs have found themselves incapable of even uttering the word federalism never mind plan for it. A style of government accepted as standard for modern countries, evidently required for the UK, has been **completely** ignored to the point where there is a significant possibility we are a week away from breaking the Union.

This is not a political system that is going to be able to handle the next century.

Dier starts at RB for one more game until Naughton can return and then he either becomes PL 1st choice(probably not yet) or the filler for Cup/Europa.

true,Orsenfelt,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"rUK would have by far the most power in a currency union, in fact I'd say it realistically wouldn't be any different to devoMax. Scotland would be unable to pursue economic policies that put rUK in danger. 

*but* that's a better position for rUK than no currency union because of how heavily interlinked our economies are. Let's say rUK has no control over Scottish policy and Scotland collapses. Scotland is the second biggest export market for the UK, it takes a thump too. Why not hold control and prevent that from happening?

On Lender of Last Resort, haven't you read the news today? All Scottish banks are going to be rUK banks specifically for lender of last resort protection. If they didn't do it by choice the EU would force them to because banks have to be registered and regulated in the country where the 'mind' is, which is London for all those banks.

Whether you like it or not those terrible toxic banks (that the Telegraph keeps telling us would be 12x the GDP of an independent Scotland) would be rUK's issue. 90% of their employees are in rUK, 90% of their assets, 90% of their customers. They are not Scottish banks beyond a historic plaque on a wall and wee bit of sentiment in the name.

It is without question that rUK by default gets 100% of the debt and 100% of the responsibility to bail out those banks. Whilst (if operations/staff remain) Scotland will be collecting corporation tax from them in Edinburgh (Where fyi RBS' retail division is. All the profit made on English mortgages etc flows through Edinburgh)

*So* Westminster have a choice to make.

Enter a currency union, offload 10% of the debt, 10% of the risk of bailing out the banks, keep a tight reign on Scottish economic policy, keep the balance of payments (Which is 10% of the GDP) in the BoE, keep rights to borrow against Scottish future assets like oil, keep the £45bn/year exports to Scotland flowing and *maybe* keep Faslane where it is to save the £20bn relocation costs.

*or*

Don't get any of those things.

Which would you choose?

&gt; This is something I very much doubt the Scottish government would accept.

I think your doubts are quite wildly misplaced considering it's the Scottish government *proposing* the idea in the first place.

true,GreyShuck,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"This may be a Doctor lite episode - with the Doctor on the run as a suspect for most of the show, and Danny Pink mistaken as a detective, and having to work with the local cops to track him.  

It turns out that the Alt-Clara was killed *before* she had a chance to save the earlier Doctor - that is still due to happen, as Capaldi can recall - so the crew will need to save him somehow themselves.

Clara gets to do some soul searching when she finds her other self murdered - questioning her identity, how had her other self lived, was it worth it etc. Also, there is the question of whether it would actually be murder of *Clara*, if she was due to die shortly, whilst saving the Doctor. Was this actually an attempt to kill the Doctor, by preventing her from doing that? 

The real killer? Whilst on Tranzalore, Smith projected a Watcher - he may not even have been aware of doing so. Under normal circumstances, the Watcher would have died with him, since he had no more regenerations left, but when the Time Lords gave him a whole new cycle, the Watcher - whihc had the form of Capaldi - survived, *and wasn't needed*. He is still around, and has been following the Doctor back and forward through time. He was attempting to kill the Doctor in order to take his next regenerations - yes, he is the proto-Valeyard. Needless to say, he manages to escape at the end.

Meanwhile, when the moment comes around and Alt-Clara would have saved Tennant (and died herself), it is our Clara who takes her place and really dies. Her final episode in the show.

listyraesder confuses me.  Later in this thread he says that Wales is still a principality, which it isn't, and that there can be a difference between a monarchy and a sovereign state, which I don't understand. As I understand it, there is presently only one monarchy/kingdom, the UK, and its 'parts' are no longer monarchies/kingdoms, due to the various acts of (political) union, so it makes no sense to speak of 'component kingdoms' unless in a historical sense, in which sense the 'component kingdoms' of the UK are the Kingdom of Ireland (1542-1800) and the Kingdom of Great Britain (1707-1800), the 'United' having been formally added only in 1801 with the creation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and, insofar as the Acts of Union 1800 that created the UK would remain in force, though amended, after Scottish independence, the UK would remain 'United' in the sense that it would continue to contain regions of the two historical states that unified in 1801 even if those regions amount to rumps (Northern Ireland for the Kingdom of Ireland and England and Wales for the Kingdom of Great Britain).

&gt; So without Scotland, it's just a smaller United Kingdom.

Yes. Just like without the 26 counties, it's just a smaller United Kingdom. The Acts of Union 1800 remain in force, though amended.  All that would need to change is '...of Great Britain...' like '... and Ireland' did.  The exact analogue would of course be '...of Southern Great Britain...', but, since Great Britain minus Scotland is precisely England and Wales, why not (according to parts) 'United Kingdom of England, Wales, and Northern Ireland' or (according to jurisdictions) 'United Kingdom of England and Wales and Northern Ireland'?  Going by parts or jurisdictions, it doesn't matter that Wales was never a kingdom.

@Xaethon
&gt; if they twist it so as to include our Welsh brothers

The twisting happened when Wales was made a part of the UK and/or when the jurisdiction was changed from 'England' to 'England and Wales'.

Well, I've been there a number of times - for work, for conferences and for pleasure - and it was not at all problematic pre 2001 (just tell them you don't want to overthrow their government (this time) and you're cool).  Since 2001, I've tried to avoid it as it's become a lot more sticky and stupid.  

On the other hand, there are undoubtedly many times more anarchists living in the country than there are trying to visit (admittedly many of the fake right wing variety), so it's all bullshit really, in the absence of any clear and present danger from an ongoing violent campaign.  Pretty much every violent anarchist campaign in the US historically has had more than a little input from the spooks/authorities there (I'm thinking particularly of that bridge bomb incident a few years back, but there are plenty of examples going right back to Haymarket).

From a personal perspective, I'm a fairly non-violent activist.  I don't think you can create a better society by engaging in the sort of beatings, rape, torture, murder and genocide for political gain that the wankers who run our countries do; even property damage is often counter-productive, although I don't view it as necessarily violent.  On the other hand, I think self defence is legitimate, and I certainly don't feel bound by rigged legal systems.  I do what I think is right, and I will break any country's laws if I believe they are illegitimate or in order to prevent a greater crime - but then so does the guy from the rambling association when he commits criminal damage to keep open a right of way.

At the end of the day, Chomsky goes backwards and forwards to the US, as have many anarchist colleagues of mine, and, whilst we're watched and fucked with, only occasionally will something serious happen.

It'll probably be fine, but might depend on the mortgage company.

If you're getting a flat, it'll be leasehold so you might need to square it with the owners.

&gt; If you have a mortgage, you may have to get the lender's permission before renting out part of your home. Also, if you are a leaseholder, or live in a shared ownership property, you may need to get the landlord's agreement first.

&gt; so presumably there would be no tax payable on the income?

That's my understanding, yes. 

&gt; I presume that would also mean that nothing would be tax deductable either?

I'm not sure on this one, but I'd be surprised if this isn't the case.

&gt; As far as I understand it, there is no requirement to use a deposit protection scheme for such an arrangement?

Yep.

&gt; Are deposits, written contracts etc generally considered necessary when renting out to friends? 

I would thoroughly recommend it, the contract part at least. You'll be able to get default ones, and it just helps clarify exactly what the rent is/etc. It's as much of a protection for them as it is for you.

The clip on Wings Over Scotland stops at this point, and they strongly imply that this is the end of this section of the report, and Salmond's answer has been censored. But they have literally cut Robinson off in mid sentence. In fact, he continues:

&gt; [...to make his point he read out a letter from the Chief Executive of RBS, about it's decision to move its registered HQ to Scotland. [Salmond] ""Let me read the key paragraph 'based on our current strategy and business plan, it is not our intention to move operations or jobs'. No jobs lost, and no loss of tax revenues either, this was simply a matter of shifting around brass plates. He went on to say the BBC's story had come from the treasury, handing over market sensitive information, he said there needed to be an official enquiry. [Salmond] ""They have now been caught red handed as being part of a campaign of scaremongering...It provides a spectacular example of the sort of campaign tactics of intimidation and bullying...Therefore I know that the BBC, in its impartial role as a public sector broadcaster, will give full cooperation to the investigation""

The episode is here: http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b04gmjf1/bbc-news-at-six-11092014. The way this has been cut on Wings Over Scotland is very misleading.

true,TheAngryGoat,lincolnshire,Starkshire,"Great, sohow do we go about sharing that 1 gigabit/second (not gigabyte - immediate 8x drop of capacity)?

Well if you're suggesting replacing cabled broadband, 100mb/s is a good target since both BT and Virgin offer that and more.

So we start off with a base of 1000/100 = 10 households. Well ok so let's do the usual ISP cheat and ovsersubscribe, and oversell the service by a factor of 10, so we're looking at covering 100 households per TV mast.

Let's work on the basis of 60 TV masts in London, so we're covering 6000 homes with broadband. Fantastic!

So, out of 8.3m population on London, we'll assume 4 per household, so let's round that down to 2 million households in London.

Your wimax idea has just serviced broadband for 0.3% of London. Except that a lot of those TV masts have significant overlap, spectrum space is limited, and signal strength degrades over distance, so even being generous here you'll have to cut that figure to 1/3. So 0.1% of residential London covered.

Now you have to figure out how to provide for the other 99.9%, plus all the businesses, of which I hear there are quite a few in London.

Oh, and you'll be placing the internet infrastructure of one of the world's largest cities purely on the airwaves where they are ripe for denial of service, hacking, snooping, effects from weather, interference, etc...

But apart from the fact that it's completely impractical, not a bad idea.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt; i find it hard to correlate being acutely socially err engaged (at least in the context of despising the 'every man for himself' mindset) sort of jars with libertarianism. So I struggle to see how I can reconcile my views with that, but I'm sure it's more my cartoon view of libertarianism than any solid anarchist ideas on the topic...

Well, I strive to keep the original meaning of libertarian alive of course.  And, to be fair, as I'm much more to the individualist end of the anarchist spectrum, so I have more in common with _classical_ American anarchists like Tucker than many of my commie and collectivist continental counterparts.  But Tucker was a socialist too, and all individualist anarchists properly so-called are against capitalism, slavery, feudalism etc., because hierarchical relationships destroy individuality - being able to choose between masters doesn't make you more free.

&gt;Not atlas shrugged though or anything? That's not you, is it? 

No, not at all.

&gt;If there's any basic primer reading bits to get a grip on your ideology send em my way, I'm genuinely curious. 

You shouldn't tempt me!  I think [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIvn8qjyrzk) is a pretty okay primer, if videos are your thing.  Worth watching from the beginning, but at about 10 minutes in he addresses the whole old style/new style libertarian thing.  But, if you read books, all the classics are available for free.

She scares some, but Lucy Parsons sums up [the principles of anarchism](https://libcom.org/library/principles-of-anarchism-lucy-parsons) pretty well for me.

[Tucker](http://flag.blackened.net/daver/anarchism/tucker/tucker2.html) beautifully distinguishes State socialism from anarchism.

[This is a pretty fine introduction to (communist) anarchism](https://libcom.org/library/what-is-anarchism-alexander-berkman).

In all seriousness I doubt that there is a large portion of the fandom that loves most if not all Doctor Who episodes. First of all there are over 800 episodes and the show has completely changed its DNA many times over the years. People are going to gravitate to certain forms of story telling and largely expect the show to fit that mold. This is why you will see a large disparity in people who like Moffat and dislike Davies and vice-versa. And remember the people who generally post on forums are the people who have stronger opinions and tend to analyze the show more, otherwise they would be content to just watch.

I really don't fault people for their opinions but I do wish that some people would open up their own imaginations a bit more for the show. Some people seem to want all the answers and are upset if they don't get them. Other people dislike the answers that they are given so much that they shut down.

I for one still welcome these different opinions and analysis though which can only serve to increase my own knowledge and interest in the show.

true,jamuck,null,null,"Fellow Pendler here (graduated 2010), just came to say agreed on the Freshers' Fair shout from nivlark. You'll become best friends with your room-mates most likely (as you'll spend most time with them), so signing up for clubs is a really great shout for meeting new people and keeping yourself fit. I was in the skiing, rowing and UOTC (Army Training Corps - which you actually get paid for).

Don't bother about a TV license - checks are never enforced on campus, but pretty much everyone panicked in first year and got one before they realised this. If you stay in one of the cheaper rooms in Pendle (i.e. not posh Pendle) then you get TV included in the kitchen anyway.

First year is an absolute doddle and as long as you pass there's no bearing on your final degree result. Have as much fun as possible in this year and try to be a yes-man (that's one thing I'd do differently if I had my time again). I say this because I carried this philosophy over past first year and ended up not studying enough in years two and three! I ended up with a 2:1 which, although good, you'll regret when you come out of Uni (if you're aiming for more).

It might sound a bit boring as you're just about to start out, but I can't emphasise enough how much I regret not getting a 1st in today's job market - like I say, ignore that advice for year one at least ;)

Running for a college officer position (JCR) is a good value way to meet people, especially from other colleges, gets you noticed, and you get a good asset to put on your CV. I'd recommend it, especially in first year when you have more free time to spend on the role (not that most require much!). Go for an easy position, like Publicity Officer or Green Officer if you can't be arsed!

Having said all this, the best way to experience Lancaster is just to figure it out with your new friends. You'll love it and remember during Freshers' week that EVERYONE IS IN THE SAME BOAT; no one knows each other. First day for me was not fun. I found that some people clicked so quickly and seemed to have found their ""long lost pals"" after just a few minutes. Don't worry if you find it tricky, you'd be surprised how many people feel the same way.

Also your parents will worry like mad so don't forget to shoot them a daily text for the first week to let them know you haven't passed out from stiff'uns at the Carleton (you'll find out soon enough about Wednesday night outs in Morecombe)!

tl;dr - Get involved with as much as possible and remember that nothing is as good as Fresher's year

Good luck and PM me if you have any questions mate!

There will also be private charities who look after the poor, and I think people will be much more willing to donate to charities when their money isn't being taken without their consent.

Considering you don't seem to know what you're actually arguing about, you're in no position to make up any of this shite you are spewing. You have changed your mind on what side you're on, twice. You have made clear that you don't know how banks operate. You have made clear that you are just an idiot saying whatever you can think of in that moment to prove a non existent point just because you think you have to.

You know nothing, you are telling me the UK is going to prevent RBS from having jobs in Scotland. That would shut RBS off from literally billions upon billions of pounds, which means a UK bank would be losing out on billions upon billions of pounds. If RBS leaves Scotland and never looks back (which won't happen, for the reasons above), another one of the many many international banks will be glad to step in and claim that wealth. That is, assuming we don't set up our own bank, which is entirely do-able. We have the resources to back it up, which is more than the UK can say it has backing up the pound.

So not only will that UK bank have lost out on billions upon billions of pounds (if they left, which they won't), the UK taxpayer will *still* be left to bail it out when it crashes. So claim this as a victory all you want, I just wanted to let you know what this move actually means.

You could, I suppose, argue that the dynamic is the same in that each party believes the other to not have received a fair punishment of their crimes. However, your point that the dynamic similar in both examples makes both parties sadists is completely unfounded. Why would prisoners target 'socially acceptable' people? If someone were truly sadist they'd target whomever. 

There is a large gap in wanting someone punished in a physical way and having the actual psychology of a sadist.

true,AnselaJonla,null,null,"&gt; The scheme will start being rolled out in early October in East Anglia, West Yorkshire, Surrey and Sussex, Mercia and the Black Country, and will run until March next year. However, if the programme is a success, the DWP say it may become nationwide.

I hope, for the sake of the people in those pilot areas, that the jobcentres there have *more* computers that actually *work*. When I signed on this week even the *staff* computer system was down. Only about four people in the whole building, which has about forty advisers, even had access to ""customer"" information databases. There's about a dozen computers for public use (appointment only apparently), but they're only working about half the time anyway.

Oh, and phone systems would be nice. There do still exist jobs that you apply for by phone, and if someone told me that I had to go do jobsearch in a designated location but they *still* expect me to use my credit to make calls, I'd tell them where to stick it.

&gt; Surely there are only so many times a person can rewrite their CV?

There is a limit, although it can be stretched by changing advisers regularly and making sure that each one has their own criteria for what constitutes a ""proper"" CV.

&gt; While it is undoubtedly valuable for claimants to gain support with their job skills, do these skills really take a quarter of a year to perfect?

For the average person? No.

&gt; One can’t help but wonder whether cooping people up indoors to redraft cover letter after cover letter is the most efficient use of time.

It isn't.

&gt; Treating unemployment as a full-time job feels more than counterproductive, it feels punitive.

Hitting the nail right on the head there.

&gt; Like many people located in rural regions, Robson, who lives six miles out of Bradford, says he would struggle to travel to the daily sessions. “I can barely afford to run my car as it is, so I’d definitely have to break into my savings to afford the petrol to drive into Bradford. But what happens to the people who don’t have any savings, let alone a car? There are only two buses a day here. Some people simply won’t be able to get there and will be sanctioned as a result”.

I suspect that is partly the point. Although, I would suggest that those people who live in such an area and can't drive would struggle to find work for much the same reason; their hours would need to fit with the bus times, and employers want people who can be flexible in their hours.

&gt; In many of the places where the scheme is being rolled out, the problem lies in a lack of jobs rather than a lack of job seeking. [...] While this work scheme might create extra applications, it cannot magically generate extra job vacancies. What is the point in perfecting your interview technique for three months, if there are no interviews out there to get? If the problem is a deficit of jobs, schemes like these can become a waste of human effort and public money.

I suspect that this hasn't been factored in at all. Areas with high unemployment have been targetted without any thought as to *why* the numbers are so high, and if they go down because the people on this scheme are being sanctioned left, right and centre, well... it shows the scheme is working, isn't it?

&gt; Robson argues that these pilot schemes are “setting people up to fail because logistical factors will stop people from making every session”.

Of course they are.

&gt; The mandatory nature of the scheme means that it will fail to take being ill or problems with childcare or transport into account.

The jobcentre doesn't care if you woke up with the shits and don't think it's wise to take yourself into public yet, or if the daycare centre had to close because of a norovirus outbreak, or if your bus company decided to stop the buses in your area because weather and terrain have made it unsafe.

In my experience, the majority of people who complain do so because they really like Doctor Who and are worried that it is becoming something that they will like less than they like it now.  While some people can legitimately find things to love in all incarnations of this show, not everyone is like that.  

Even if you love 90% of the show, there's still 10% that you don't.  We look at that 10% and are disturbed by it.  So we complain about it.  Sometimes, amidst those complaints, we say things we don't really mean, like ""This show is utter crap now"" or ""What the heck are they doing to Doctor Who?""

My suggestion is to forgive it or ignore it.  Asking people to stop voicing their opinions on the internet is like trying to stop the tides, meaning of course that we could do it if we used enough nukes, but its not worth sacrificing so many lives.

As far as ""overanalyzing"" goes, that just something many people (myself included) do.  When I read a book, or watch movies or TV, or play a video game, I analyze what is happening.

It's a dictatorship that has dozens of concentration camps where it sends its own citizens year after year. Look up *Escape from Camp 14* or *Aquariums of Pyongyang* sometime. These concentration camps actually make Auschwitz look tame (if not simply the time scale... the Nazis only managed to run concentration camps for a few years whereas these NK camps have been around for decades) and obviously that is saying a lot.

It's not just an isolationist nation, it's nation that starves and oppresses its people.

I feel sorry for its citizens, but I'll never feel sorry for the country itself. It is literally the worst country on Earth. I'd absolutely love it if NK was invaded in a way that took out their leadership but saved their citizens, but it won't happen.

&gt; The Quilliam Foundation, a counter-extremism organisation, told us that no one keeps reliable data on white converts to Islamism.

So this dude looks through newspaper articles and News reports and counts any ""redheads"" he spots

&gt; We discovered that 76 per cent of white British converts to radical Islam had red hair. In the Daily Mail archives, 69 per cent of white Brits lured into jihadism or the orbit of an extremist preacher were ginger. The number was similar for the Mirror and the Telegraph. The Guardian yielded a full 100 per cent redhead rate for the stories we sampled.

Wow many science much research!

&gt; Good luck getting today’s politically correct Police to admit there’s a correlation between red hair and radicalisation, though – even though they surely must have noticed what’s happening on British streets. **“There is no evidence to suggest an individual’s physical appearance has any bearing on their vulnerability to radicalisation.**

For one thing textile industries, mining, steel making, car manufacturing and so on are all the first incarnation of automation. Extremely expensive robots that can only do a simple task. What we're now entering is the age of intelligent automation with software and more complicated robots able to learn to do tasks. Yes they are awful at it right now and significantly slower but it's still a net gain when you consider how much less they cost than a human and how they never stop working.

For another thing the number of jobs cut vs. the people required to maintain simply don't add up. There's a breaking point where you enter an age of post-abundance and people are starting to realise that might actually be a hell of a lot sooner than we thought.

It's hardly going to make jobs go poof overnight but it's a serious discussion that does need to happen because if you automate 45% of the workforce and don't actually change how the economy and the welfare state works it will get kinda messy.

true,BraveSirRobin,null,null,"&gt;  yet still want to be tied to the UK by something as important as currency

Because the costs of change to UK businesses on both sides of the border will be immense. Forcing Scotland away from the pound is in neither sides best interests, we represent major trading partners with each other. You are proposing a notable re-write of accounting systems used in every single business's supply chains as they bounce across the border many times. Every single mortgage and loan contract in Scotland would need to be re-written at huge cost, every widget bought from Acme would be subject to daily price variances. Commission costs would be added to every single cross-border transaction. 

Worse still, every Scottish bank account will simultaneously dump it's pounds on the open market, seeking to flush out their reserves to be replaced with the currency used by their customers. You think this weeks change was bad? There is no doubt that all of this would cause an immediate recession in both countries. 

All you are hearing just now is pre-vote waffle, if the vote goes to ""yes"" then their attitudes will change immediately. They will not shoot themselves in the foot. 

&gt;  I just think independence should mean independence

Then would you agree that the national electrical and gas grids and should also be disconnected from Scotland and that the north of England freezes this winter? A truly independent nation should not have to rely on it's northern neighbour for heat and light, right? 

Sharing a currency does limit Scotland's ""independence"" somewhat as it cannot directly control the interest rates. Which is exactly the status quo anyway; the UK's interest rates are based on what London needs, not the rest of the UK. I'm happy to take that one small hit for complete control over everything else, most notably foreign policy and war making. 

&gt;  look how the pound's dropped in value just in the last few days

It's unnaturally high at present, look at it's historic performance. A high pound doesn't benefit most UK businesses though, if anything most want a weaker currency as it suits the exporters of goods. China goes to great lengths to keep it's currency weak. Advocating for a strong currency was one of Thatcher's core objectives in her infamous ""[deflationary strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premiership_of_Margaret_Thatcher#Deflationary_strategy)"" and it played a notable role in the death of UK industry and our switch to being a financial services provider.

true,BraveSirRobin,null,null,"&gt; how can a country be given such a high credit rating 

Because we have most of Europe's oil and an ungodly amount of it's renewable energy generation potential. We have strong industry and a highly educated population. Short of electing innumerate leaders we are a very safe bet for lending money to. 

&gt;  when they have no clue what currency they could use?

Jesus, do people still believe this ""no plan B"" crap?

We are using the pound. Preferably with a formal currency union but if not we'll continue using it anyway. We'll get a union because we won't take any of the UK's national debt with us otherwise. Fair is fair, take both the assets and the liabilities. The pound is a UK national asset which we ""own"" 1/8th of; suggesting otherwise is the admission that Scotland is not an equal part of the current union.

The UK treasury has already stated that legally the burden of the debt is theirs as Scotland will be a new nation. They have said that they are prepared to shoulder it if that happens. Scotland will not be ""defaulting"" on anything as the media spin claims. 

&gt; and Belgium and Spain have both stated they'd veto their admission into the EU.

No they haven't, that is a lie that you have been told. Belgium haven't spoken on the subject at all and Spain have said they will not block it so long as independence follows UK law. That's a clever statement as Spain views the Catalonia referendum as ""illegal"". 

We are already in the EU. If we are out for even a moment thousands of EU fishermen lose their fishing grounds. Millions of companies need to start treating trades with Scotland differently as they will no longer be bound under trade treaties. EU citizens living in Scotland will lose their legal right to work there, as will many Scots abroad. EU membership will be automatic as the effects will be a nightmare for large numbers of people and there is no valid reason for us not to be in Europe. Scotland leaving would set a precedent that groups like UKIP would seize upon and the last thing that the EU wants is states leaving.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Are you counting Belfast in this ""no industrial base"" 

I'm not counting Belfast for obvious reasons. You can't compare Protestant Ireland and Catholic Ireland in Ireland during the Union. 

&gt; And how did the economy improve. ireland was in a self declared ""state of emergency"" untill 1976.

The economy improved in that it grew, the population began to stabilise, investment was made in building a national infrastructure. I'm Irish and have read a lot of modern Irish history never heard of this ""state of emergency.""

&gt; Ireland (as a whole) pre partition was richer than Scotland ( remember they had no Oil and banking had not been restructured in Scotland) and wales (even modern Northern Ireland is richer than wales)

I seriously doubt that. Ireland was a colonial economy until the later part of the 19th century. The large majority of people didn't have a vote. Land reform wasn't finished until the later 19th century. It was as good at it ever was just pre independence, but there had been no investment or development of industry or anything by the British Government in Ireland.

As I understood it, it wasn't until after the filming of ""The Next Doctor"" they knew Tennant was leaving. Somewhat reinforced by the ""He will knock four times"" plot only starting in the Easter Special. 

I sortof felt that was the writing staff / RTD taking out their anger by making Tennant suddenly turn somewhat Whiny about the knowledge he was going to regenerate especially considering how soon it was after the 'wasted' regeneration at the end of the fourth season. 

If you want a more character specific reason as to why, I suppose the thoughts of how he had been so close to a regeneration, and also knew he only had one remaining one after what he did might make some sense.

Another idea is simply to point out, and while the doctor's claims of age aren't the most reliable, he was 903 when he entered his tenth regeneration, and 906 when he left it. We never find out how long that regeneration really lasted, but if the war doctor was only about 800 when he regenerated ( though that would make 9's comments in Rose a bit odd unless he really took a long time before looking in a mirror... though the fact that he had several historical appearances without rose lends to that possibility ) then, and this is just going off new who mind you, 10 might have only 'lived' for three or four years, the reality probably closer to double digits, but that could mean he's the incarnation who lived the least of any doctor.",0,1410487848,null,0,false,0,ckfxjre,t3_2g5fb6,t1_ckfxjre,t3_2g5fb6,null,1427059989,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

true,Allichan93,null,null,"As an avid fan of Doctor Who and Sherlock, Stephen Moffat's style of production is a different breath of air than the styles of producers Mark Gatiss and Russell T. Davies due to his usage of symbols that are meaningless until the climax, shocking character development twists, and his love of cliff hangers.  I agree with all that you have listed about Moffat, as those are his strong points in writing and production of the two series.  However, there are many things that he falls short on, or otherwise overuses to the point of losing fans.  

His worst flaw is the development of female characters, or in this case, lack thereof.  According to Alyssa from Whovian Feminism on Tumblr (whovianfeminism.tumblr.com), the most recent seasons that Moffat has played a larger role in the production of have subsequently scored badly on the Bechdel Test.  The Bechdel Test is a measure of the amount of times a female character in a TV show or movie does not talk about a man in that setting, and has their own ambitions and development outside of their relationship with men (for more background on the Bechdel Test, visit this link: http://io9.com/why-the-bechdel-test-is-more-important-than-you-realize-1586135613).  In Doctor Who, this can be seen in how Amy Pond was obsessed with the Doctor, and how most conversations between Amy and River Song were about the Doctor, rather than about any topic that could better define and elaborate on their relationship to each other.  There was so much potential for delving deeper into their relationship throughout the seasons, but Moffat left the viewers unsatisfied by resolving the plot quickly and suddenly.  Most recently, the 12th Doctor has blatantly told Clara Oswald that he ""is not her boyfriend,"" which reflects on how clingy she is, to the point of being annoying, and how Moffat could do better in his female character development (Clara has a strong enough personality!). 

Other than Moffat's weakness in female character development, he overuses different production styles, including the ""doom scenarios"" that you mentioned.  He is brilliant at building up tension and revealing the importance of seemingly unimportant items and symbols, but the climaxes always tend to leave the viewer a little bit dissatisfied.  When fans were given two entire years to speculate on how Sherlock survived the fall and build up these fantastic explanations amidst their frustration at waiting so long, Moffat's explanation in season three fell flat and tried to redeem itself through comedy.  Moffat is a very talented producer and uses great techniques in his writing, but he also has some overwhelming weaknesses that are making fans be not very fond of him.  In my personal opinion, he would do better to be the writer for special episodes rather than for entire seasons, so as not to worry about extensive female character development and strong plot resolutions.  However, he remains as an executive producer of Doctor Who, garnering the hate from viewers expressed all over the Internet.",0,1410488856,null,0,false,0,ckfy1e5,t3_2eh56b,t1_ckfy1e5,t3_2eh56b,null,1427059720,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Watched from the 05 reboot, Farting aliens or not, I'll still stand by Eccleston being my favorite doctor, but I guess I'm a fan of the short lived doctors since McGann rates highly for me, and I'm wishing there was more of Hurt's War Doctor. 

Tennant and Smith both did lighthearted moments well, both could do the crazy doctor (especially in Smith's case), but Eccleston just felt right for the post Time War doctor, he could be the Doctor, and still show a dark side well. Tennant and Smith both fell short when they were in their Dark Doctor moments. 

Still not sure where Capaldi falls since what we've gotten so far seems to be trying too hard to make him Dark, and instead making him just come off as a Jackass. ",0,1410489180,null,0,false,0,ckfy714,t3_2g5960,t1_ckfy714,t3_2g5960,null,1427059648,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

&gt; How did your in-laws end up in a situation in which they have an outstanding (interest only?) mortgage in their 70s with no plan to pay it off?

Yes, interest only. Long and complex story... One son bought a farm in Canada for the in-laws with a cash investment from his sister (my wife) and a high street mortgage. He then wanted to take out his down-payment to buy another property so he asked the in-laws to invest. Mother and sister now owned around 45% of the farm with the remainder mortgaged. He then took out another secured loan to raise the finance on the farm to 80% LTV -- he was the only name on title. His other property deal went sour and he couldn't repay the second loan, we then guaranteed it to avoid foreclosure and he replaced it with another one for two years. The property was eventually sold and cleared both loans but mother and sister's cash was lost.

Mother obtained her cash by extending the mortgage on the property in the UK. She also extended the mortgage to fund Father's property investments in India -- building white elephants. Meanwhile, other son becomes an alcoholic and spends years creating a different financial mess but just keeps burning through cash. He ends up losing wife, house and three jobs. And then ex-wife decides to start a business and swindles another £40K out of Mother's sister! 

So one son cost around £100K, other son and ex-wife added a further £100K and Father added the remainder. All-in-all, it went severely sideways and we've been resolving this for 7 years or so; unpicking everything and protecting what we have. Both sons have no assets and are technically bankrupt -- one is propped up by his wife and the other simply hasn't filed.

We are now trying to get the Sister's cash written into the equity, consolidate their debts but keep the house as we can rent out four bedrooms with the property. The property brings in enough income to pay the mortgage and their two loans. It's also split (to all intents and purposes) into a two bed and a four bed house so the in-laws have their independence.

Congratulations! With your bold economic policy you're put 1.4 million in to a position where they either turn to crime or die in the streets. I suspect that might not do much to reduce crime rates or the number of broken homes. TBF you could argue that there will be less broken homes if people can't actually afford a home. Broken homeless shelters and broken shop doorways will go through the roof though.

But what about charity? Well I've given you a perfect labour market and as another treat I'm going to assume that you give all the money saved on eradicating welfare back to the nation and everybody gives every last penny of their windfall to good causes. Even then, most of that isn't going to help the people without a safety net: it's going to Cancer Research, it's going to the Red Cross, and it's going to donkey sanctuaries. All worthy causes but not much use if your most pressing concern is feeding your children.

Well universities decide how many EU students that they can take on, so if there are budget restrictions, then they would simply reduce the number of places for EU students (which is what people from England, Northern Ireland, and Wales would count as after independence). The point is - it is EU law that EU students get treated the same as home students (Irish students already get free tuition, whereas students from the rUK still have to pay tuition fees currently), so if iScotland becomes a member of the EU as planned, Scotland would become a bit of a free education haven for rUK students. But places would be extremely competitive.

I understand your reasons for doing this, but as you move forward, you might want to consider removing this restriction. Perhaps a better solution would be that training credits can only be used on the club they were earned on? (The shop bought ones could still be used on any club. You would just have to keep track and display them separately. I realise this would require some back end reworking though)

I think it's a great concept. It's quite simple to grasp, but I can see the complexity increase when you get more players and have to make selection decisions. (On that note, have you considered a subs bench? Since if a player is pulled out of the real starting lineup, it will have a huge impact to lose 1 of your 3 players.)

Would love to see more clubs added, especially from other leagues, as most supporters probably won't enjoy playing for EPL rivals.

Obviously interest caught up with them and since they were out of CL, Liverpool was fucked for a few good years. 

It's not really public trading that I have a problem with. The Glazers recently just sold a fairly small percentage on the market and still kept a controlling stake, meaning that what they raked in was pure profit. It's the massive debt (They've lowered it to £350 million recently. You could buy a third of Spurs for that!) that these types of owners bring in, inevitably leading to a club like United's fairly unambitious transfer policies as of late. The problem is basically that-they weren't putting a dime down into the United, expecting the godlike powers of Fergie to last forever.

true,agentdcf,flair8,,"(EDIT: I expanded on things a bit)

AEG or an owner like that would be ideal for Spurs. They've done wonders for the Los Angeles Kings. The real core of their business model is property development and management (they own sports arenas and concert venues all over the world), but they recognized that owning an arena and property in downtown LA was only really useful with the Kings as a successful team; as such, they've learned to put hockey people in charge of hockey and leave them there. The club is in good shape both financially and competitively, and the long-term ownership seems to be stable. 

A company like that would probably love the opportunity to develop a large bloc of property in London, centered around an arena and a winning club. That combination would lead toward a fairly sustainable business model of which Spurs were one component. We likely wouldn't see really large transfer budgets, but they would recognize the importance of a quality product on the pitch for the other parts of their business. As such, they wouldn't see Spurs as a cash cow to simply suck money out of. Instead I'd expect a transfer budget and wage structure that would keep Spurs competitive, and would be in line with the revenues from the new stadium and from selling players from the youth academy. I suppose, then, that it would be more or less like it is now, only with a larger overall revenue stream from a larger stadium and perhaps, down the line, with more merchandise sales and bigger television contracts. 

I would also speculate that they wouldn't jack ticket prices up too high, since a big part of their property development and management strategy is built around getting people into their neighborhoods. They want as many people moving through the area as possible, so their incentive is keep prices reasonable. I don't think we'd see any real bargains, but nor would Spurs ticket prices be out of line with other teams in the area. 

Overall, I think this would be far better than a moneybags owner whose funds are somewhere between dubious and outright corrupt, and whose management will run up huge debts or get us in trouble with financial fair play.

The referendum itself is actually incredibly peaceful for what it is, more than others have been in the world.

Individual No campaigners can be just as bad, such as one who drove dangerously at Alex Salmond's car displaying No signs in the window which is a lot more illegal and idiotic than heckling or throwing eggs, but alas that was not the headline anyone went with.

10, however, had started to move on. He was having adventures, enjoying life. He was the cool kid. After everything that had happened that was a big deal. Suddenly he's faced with the possibility that he'll lose all that and the next Doctor might be a miserable grouch or angsty or angry. That must have been terrifying to him.

That was the other thing. Regenerating alone isn't something he normally does.

That's a pretty big assumption over such a vague statement.

The Sisterhood aren't Time Lords. 

&gt;the promised land is Karn.

From what we've seen of Karn it's a dark, desolate, rocky wasteland, not the sunny lush green of wherever Missy is taking them. I know this doesn't preclude it completely but it does make it seem extremely unlikely.

&gt;The sisters of Karn can trigger regeneration and save people 

Trigger regeneration in *Time Lords*. Their cups of magic juice don't make just anyone regenerate, it starts the regeneration process in a controlled manner in those who already have the ability to regenerate, i.e. Time Lords.

&gt;which also completely explains how the Doctor can regenerate more than twelve times!

It was pretty clear that the Time Lords gave him the new set of regenerations in *Time of the Doctor*.  It's not something that was made up just for the occasion: The first time that it was mentioned that the Time Lords had this ability was way back in *The Five Doctors* during Peter Davison's run, so it's been pretty well established for a while now.

&gt;This is why everyone else who has supposed to be dead appears on Karn; because the sisterhood brought them back

The number generated only lasts for a certain amount of time (around 10 seconds I believe), and can only be used from one IP address i.e. you couldn't use a key logger to collect the TFA pin.

As Money Dashboard is read only, even if you somehow got access to my MD account (let's say someone was able to mirror my display whilst I was using it), you still couldn't change anything associated with my account.

If someone with transport difficulties were offered a job, I would assume they'd make arrangements initially by getting lifts off friends, borrowing money to hire a car, cycling part of the journey, or arranging with their employer to work hours that fit around bus schedules as a temporary measure until they are paid and can make longer-term travel arrangements. Once they've got some money coming in reliably from a paid job, transport becomes just another expense alongside bills and rent to be paid for with income. But for meetings at the job centre, it's a different matter, because there's no pay to cover it and no guaruntee there will be in the medium term. In that situation, even a return bus ticket every day might well eat up a very large chunk of the jobseeker's allowance anyway - say it's a £4 return, if you're doing that five days a week that's £20 straight off, about a third of what they're getting, just to prove they're not being lazy.",0,1410502962,null,0,false,0,ckg35qc,t3_2g5jbw,t1_ckg35qc,t1_ckfu1lp,null,1427056627,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

It'll be offset by the fact many jobs will move to the rUK (e.g. RBS or UK public sector jobs that are farmed out to Scotland), and even more so by the end of the Barnett Formula. Most impartial commentators seem to agree it'll leave Scots with roughly the same amount of money as they receive now or perhaps marginally less, so they could probably afford to continue offering a similar standard of public services. It's also worth bearing in mind even if Scots get the 90% claim, there aren't really any indigenous Scottish companies extracting the oil... so the corporation tax for several large companies extracting oil (e.g. BP) is still going to be mainly heading to London. That's important, because in 2012 BP paid something like $2.3bn in tax.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"&gt; We have most of Europe's oil. 

Yup. 60% actually. Except its locked at the bottom of a deep sea which is expensive to extract commercially. However... banking on oil at the start of a shale gas revolution is probably not that sensible. Scotland has only modest shale oil reserves and these are thought to be in difficult to extract locations. The rUK however has nearly 500 million metric tons of shale oil - the second or third highest in Western Europe but in what are thought to be some of the better extraction locations.

The renewable energy crap is basically an allusion to tidal and wind power - both of which are now increasingly seen as gimmicky. Although they can offset energy from sources like nuclear power its very difficult to generate significant amounts of power from that kind of renewable energy alone.  

&gt; no plan B"" crap

He doesn't have a plan B though does he. His plan was to colour the lack of a clear best option as ""seeking a mandate from the electorate for a currency union"". But its redundant since that option isn't on the table, and contrary to what he says I really don't think you're going to see the 3 main UK political parties make a humiliating U-turn on this. So his other two options are the Euro which is a non-starter, or sterlingisation which is far from ideal for Scots.

&gt; We are already in the EU. 

I agree, Scots are in the EU. But just the day before yesterday Jean Claude Junker said he thinks Scottish membership will take 5-6 years. So that leaves Scots with 2 options... remain in the UK for 5-6 years so they can join the EU on day 1 of independence... OR they leave the UK and have to rough it alone for 4 years. 

4 Years of not being in the EU probably isn't very viable for Scotland. They're one of the only UK regions that is a net recipient of both EU funds and UK tax (Scotland represents 8.3% of the population but pays only 8.2% of tax... yet spends £10,152 per head compared with just £8,529 in England). Effectively although Scots preach that their GDP is higher, it's only higher because it is made artificially higher by the handouts they are given from the UK state and the EU. 

Scots will need access to the EU from day 1... not to sell their products to the continent, but to sell their products to their largest trading partner which happens to be in the EU.... the UK. It's also worth pointing out something like 75% of all Scottish exports are actually shipped via the rUK at docks like Southampton and Felixstowe. Container ships from asia and africa operate a established route where they travel from developing nations with goods, stop off in the English channel at ports like Cherbourg, Southampton and Felixstowe to drop off products for the UK and pick up British exports - then travel on to the large continental container ports at Hamburg and Rotterdam. If Scotland isn't part of the EU then it'll get hit by a doubly-wammy... first the duty of ""exporting"" to the rUK, then the cargo cost of having it's goods shipped from the rUK to the continent.

If we'd started by using two digits of the year then we'd have run out in 2003 (registrations started in 1903) and would have needed a new system then, so that doesn't give us a single simple system. Changing the two digits every six months also makes more options available per year, which isn't an issue now but could be within the 50 years that the current system lasts.

2) Find ways to incentivise the house building sector. We need more affordable housing all across the country.

a) refuse to take the necessary educational programmes for a role.
b) refuse to move for a valid work opportunity.

Once you've applied for the current jobs, and there are no new jobs around, what do you do? Just sit in a room waiting for a new job to be posted?

I only claimed benefits once. It was just after I left university because I thought I might as well claim some benefits while I was searching for a job. It was the most depressing and patronising thing I'd ever done - and I had really good job prospects.

I can't imagine what it must be like to be made to feel like that day after day.  I wouldn't be surprised if we see a rise in suicides in these areas.

true,DevilishRogue,cnty-england,England,"&gt; Or we could ask about it. My first post was a question. We don't know, either way. It is something worth knowing, and finding out, questioning, not ""shelving"".

I think it is safe to assume that considering the point of the policy is to get people back into work that they wouldn't be sanctioned for going to a job interview provided the job centre are informed.

&gt; In which case they should be paid minimum wage for the hours spent sitting in the Jobcentre.

Does that mean cutting all of their other benefits and just providing the equivalent of minimum wage? 

&gt; Jobcentres have enough computers and phones for unemployed people who will be expected to sit there for seven hours a day, do they?

Good point. Most people have a PC at home where they can look for actual jobs on actual jobsites instead of the heavily restricted and too few computers they'd be queuing up for at a Job Centre.

&gt; This is counterproductive if you want people to find work.

Agreed. This is definitely not an effective way to get the majority of people to find work.

true,SteveD88,cnty-england,Northamptonshire,"A key part of the SNP strategy is to paint everything that happens as positive, in an almost *‘this is good for bitcoin’* way. You can hear it in almost any press release or media comment from them; they want to be the optimists, because that lets them paint anyone who disagrees with them as pessimistic, condescending or fear-mongering. 

This approach is very powerful, and it’s really struck a chord with the electorate. The problem is that it also effectively shuts down real debate on the big problems; the currency issue (which is really quite serious with no apparent solution) has been pushed aside by it. 

The thing with business leaders is they have no time for optimism; they can’t spend it or invest it. Business leaders are pragmatists. So when business leaders are saying ‘this is a bad idea, this is bad for Scotland and the UK’, and Salmod is saying ‘this is fine, nothing will change, it’s good for Scotland’, which one should the public trust?

That was the heart of Nick’s question. He wasn’t trying to say anyone lacks integrity, but rather, force Salmod to concede the point that he didn’t have a lot of large businesses on side (which is plain as day to anyone who actually cares about the economic side of the debate). Salmod dealt with the question by stepping around it.

&gt; Alex Salmond, the first minister, has linked post-referendum negotiations on sharing the UK's debt with his demands for a new currency union, saying that without a deal on sterling Scotland might refuse to pay its share of historic UK debt.

&gt; The Treasury statement said the UK government would ""in all circumstances honour"" the terms of all its debts agreed before the referendum, regardless of whether it and a future Scottish government reached a deal on how to repay Scotland's share.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;You seem to think that if the majority of the voters approve of something that is highly undemocratic, then that in itself is sufficient to make that thing democratic.

When it doesn't particularly affect the democratic process or government itself, then why not? Nobody involved has chosen to have powers taken away. The Queen has no independent power to use at her will...hence it's not generally considered a problem.

&gt;This is true only in a convoluted and pedantic sense

Not really, it's direct and easily verifiable - and addresses the 'not elected' issue. One could only say it was *not* democratic if people voted to have their rights reduced, or councillors/ MP roles were bestowed on someone by something other than elections; but they're not. With regards to ascension - for your concerns to be valid, you'd have to demonstrate an example of the Queen using her 'power' for her own ends and nothing else with the sanction of parliament - the Royals really aren't there to govern at all, hence it's not considered democratically important how the throne is passed on.

&gt;that is no use at all when talking about how countries are governed –you know, laws made and budgets allocated.

None of which are controlled by the Queen.

&gt;In your second para ""yes, that is what I'm saying"" would have sufficed. 

I was illustrating that it doesn't even need to get as far as a vote - there has to be a uprising of anti-royal sentiment for the idea of a referendum to gain any traction in the first place. And in any case - that might have sufficed *for you*, but don't assume you're the only one reading.

&gt;that you think I have something to illustrate by asking that question means that you are not quite understanding what I'm saying anyway.

&gt; The ATAR is a percentile score given between “less than 30” up to 99.95 (in a minimum increment of 0.05) which denotes a student’s ranking relative to his or her peers upon completion of their secondary education. For example, an ATAR score of 99.0 means that the student performed better than 99% of his or her peers, and ranks lower than 0.95% of peers (as the maximum score is 99.95).

&gt; This score is used by university and tertiary education programs as a clear and intuitive ranking to select prospective applicants for their programs, though other means may be used in combination (such as the UMAT for undergraduate-entry medical studies, or interviewing candidates that meet an ATAR score threshold).

&gt; The ATAR score is derived from a single aggregate score that is the sum of the four best subjects that the student has completed at a Year 12 standard added to 10% of the sum of the weakest two subjects (for a total of 6 subjects).

But it's increasingly becoming about sanctions instead of support.

The government could solve the unemployment problem and the housing problem in one go if they built more council housing rather than relying on private housing developers who care about profit to do all the building. You get increased construction activity, which means more people employed and more apprenticeships available. You end up with more housing to put the tens of thousands of people on housing waiting lists into. Training is provided to those who don't have job skills, jobs are creted for those who do (and not just in site activities like brick laying and plastering and plumbing etc, but also in office-based roles like HR, to manage more employees, work winning (since contractors will be bidding for the work local councils are offering), estimating, accounting, legal, etc.) And all the while you've got people paying income tax and companies paying VAT and workers commuting to their workplaces paying fuel duty and VAT on the petrol and deisel getting them to their workplaces, so while it might take some capital in the first place to get the projects off the ground, a lot of that capital returns to the government in the form of more taxes being paid.

Yet Scotland portrays itself as having a left wing social equality leaning populous. Now you could say Scotland should keep Scotland's money in Scotland rather than contributing to the UK and helping out say the North East which is currently seeing hard times. And that would be a valid opinion for sure, but also a right wing one. Where do you stop? So for instance once independent you won't be supporting the North East of England in anyway, but doubtless there will be net contributing areas of Scotland and net supported areas. The ultimate destination of this journey is American style libertarianism, which is all well and good until something goes wrong. For instance, over my adult life I would say so far that I have been lucky enough to be a net contributor. I have always been able to find a job, never had a major medical problem etc., etc. So in some sense I am supporting some proportion of the population as well as myself. But for me that's fine because I could get cancer, or hit by a bus, or laid off tomorrow and then for some period temporary or permanent I would be supported. Indeed, unless you are a 1% the chances are that you will not get through life without being a supported at some point (and of course you could extend the argument to the 1% too as they require a solid infrastructure to become/remain a 1%er). 

So by all means make the ""Scotland's money for Scotland alone argument"" - fair enough. But see it for the ultra-capitalist stand it is. By all means justify it by saying rUK is too rightwing, but don't expect those of us down South who respect Scotland's perceived socialization leanings to be particularly happy about being left in the lurch - we think it would be better if you stayed and carried on helping work towards an fairer society for the whole of the country.

There are jobs (but of course many of these will be pyramid schemes, investment traps or otherwise not ""real"" jobs):

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/more-vacancies-available-in-the-uk-than-at-any-time-since-2008

&gt; Until we are in a situation where we have a shortage of willing workers then the absolute best that can be do with programs like this is to make the people applying for work more desperate.

We do have a shortage of willing workers as the various employers saying no one turns up for jobs point out, but the problem seems to be as much a skills shortage for many vacancies as lazy employees:

http://feweek.co.uk/2014/01/30/skills-shortage-behind-25-pc-of-vacancies-going-unfilled-says-ukces-survey/

&gt; The end result for the taxpayer of 5 desperate people applying for the same job versus 5 normal people is... negligible.

Indeed. A programme like this shouldn't be aimed at those desperately seeking work, but more at those who lack the drive or incentive to get back into work.

&gt; Same number of people are unemployed at the end of the process, they're just in a worst personal position from the stress of it all. There's no benefit.

That implies that the aim of this scheme is to penalise jobseekers for the sake of it rather than to reduce the appeal of being on benefits in order to make having a job a more desirable scenario for them. 

&gt; I'd drop the effort entirely and focus my efforts on improved educational opportunities, include retraining, and on with a focus on areas where the economy is short workers.

I agree that this would be a better use of resources. Those likely to be affected by this scheme aren't those we should be trying to help. We'd be better off helping those who are trying their best to find work but lack some requirements that they could easily be helped with. These sorts of people tend not to be classed as high priority in policy making though, unfortunately. The silent majority never get the resources.

It would require a great deal of thought by experts (which I am not) to even put a percentage on that, but for instance as a much smaller country how would Scotland have faired in oil licensing deals with companies? Probably not so well if you look around the world. Would Scotland have been able to keep so much of the field on its own - perhaps, but attempted and actual resource grabs can and do still happen - look at the cod wars, the Spanish fishing fleets in Canadian waters, the Russian oil grab in the Arctic and so on. And that is just a couple of sectors. The last thirty years have been a rollercoaster - so many things that could/would/might have been better or worse for a small country.

Not really, even if you're in the cheapest shared house possible they'll still only pay a part of it.

Local Council's can be negotiated with though, I managed to negotiate them paying my full rent for a month since I didn't expect to be out of a job that long.

&gt;But the article makes it clear that this isn't supposed to be a universal scheme but rather one targeted against those who aren't able to get and keep a job.

If you quit or get fired, you're sanctioned for 6 months anyway. Even if you've come from the most hellish workplace possible. The only way to get jobseekers immediately after a job is by being made redundant, and usually the company will give you a certain amount for that anyway.

No-one likes being on the pittance that is jobseekers, even the unemployed. The system has failed them in some way and making them spend 8 hours there ""touching up their CV"" isn't at all productive. We need to find out why it failed them, and address that.

Sort of how there's facebook ""*like this if you want to stop human trafficking*"", ""*like this to cure cancer*"" -- totally pointless exercises that will only serve to make people feel like they've done something meaningful when they haven't.

The article went on to explain that the historic ""peaceful protests"" were actually only successful because of the huge strain that they put on the legal system/economy (eg the legal and financial burden of putting MLK supporters through the courts/ Gandhi supporters who stopped the salt trade of the British Empire etc).

In short it seems that **Civil diosbedience** with carefully planned legal strategies are the key; using legitimate legal (or semilegal) methods to totally exhaust resources until a change is made by law.

This is just another case of government trying to solve a problem behind the books and creating another problem in it's wake. 

I say Thatcher not because she's an outstanding fucktard (RIP), but because to the best of my knowledge it was her government that arranged this, obviously other parties in power since then haven't reversed the decision.

true,Tippo89,lfcflame,,"All good points, but I think with this sort of thing you have to take a look at yourself and consider whether the 'new thing' really is all that bad or you just have a problem with it because it's new. I can't believe one bloke in a liver bird suit causes the author this much stress. It seems to me it's more about the infiltration of americanisms into football.

I'm not really bothered either way about Mighty Red but I do disagree with the author's angle. It's more traditional to play some nice classic pop tunes before the game and during half time. It's more traditional to just have the bench come out and have a knock about while the crowd wait for the second half. It's more traditional for there to be nothing really happening before kick off because it's up to the crowd to build the atmosphere.

Trouble is, things have changed. The fans which will be at Anfield tomorrow are simply not the same type of people who were there in the 70's and 80's. Back then, my Dad tells me he would be in the ground ages before kick off because everyone would be singing songs and building the atmosphere. Now if you get there 10 minutes before kick off the stadium is only half full, there's some dull chart music on and a gentle hubub. 

Part of the reason for that is that there is less of a community than there was. A great many of the fans you'll see at Anfield now only make it down for a few games a year, perhaps only one, so its very difficult for them to feel comfortable and get involved (think of the difference between doing kareoke in a room with just your mates vs doing it on a busy Saturday in the Roscoe Arms). 

How can the club make those fans feel at home (pun intended)? A lot of fans I speak to seem to take the attitude that the club should do nothing because as long as the Kop is happy and traditions are kept that's all that matters. 

I disagree. I would like the club to do more to help fans who don't attend frequently feel part of the family, and that extends to some of the things lampooned in the article as being NFL-ish.

I'm talking about playing atmosphere building music before kick off and half time (when they play Hell's Bell's for New York Giants games it's a damn sight more atmosphere building than Stereophonics or Little Mix) to really build things up. Putting on something at half time, it doesn't have to be a blow up assault course sponsored by Subway and if you make it in a certain time Sturridge is there with a Chicken Teriyaki with extra green peppers, but I do think there should be more than (last season) Victor Moses half heartedly booting balls at Brad Jones. Making more of a deal for the team coming out than just 'oh there they are'. 

My problem with the article is that the author bangs on about how we should be intimidating opponents and building atmosphere, but then criticises the new american-style aspects for not being traditional. Would he prefer we leave things as they are then, everyone turns up five minutes before kick off as Coldplay -Sky full of Stars really ramps up the wet blanket atmosphere? Can't have it both ways.

Tl;dr - Modern fans aren't like 70's fans, the club needs to adapt to that and I think there's a lot LFC could learn from other sports in terms of atmosphere building. ",0,1410515573,null,0,false,0,ckg5r0c,t3_2g6jj8,t1_ckg5r0c,t3_2g6jj8,null,1427055011,16,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,16

&gt;Independence being bad for business is a claim that has been repeatedly levelled against the yes campaign. Salmond has said it isn't. It is a perfectly reasonable question to ask him why people should trust him.

No, it actually hasn't. The BBC has made this claim, and you believe it for some reason. Salmond hasn't said anything, he has quoted other business leaders saying the opposite of the BBC and they are attacking *him* personally for it. Watch the unedited video, it's not difficult to see this for what it is.

I could not believe that the sheer amount of ""accidents"" every time these key documents have vanished are *all* down to inept archiving. I can remember at least a dozen occasions in the last couple of years where this has happened and it was always key documents specific to the inquiry. The ""child prostitution ring in parliament"" is a good one. So too with the police in Rotherham ""throwing away rape victims clothing"". That isn't down to ineptitude but is intentional manipulation.

At the end of the day, the archives are set up within incredibly bureaucratic systems of checks and doublechecks so that these ""mistakes"" cannot happen in the first place - yet they do. The simple answer is that somewhere along the lines, somebody has gone in there and moved or removed files -- either intentionally with malice, or accidentally; the end result is the same: **current archival methods are not secure**.

Need another example? Evidence rooms. There have been plenty of instances in the past where police staff have STOLEN EVIDENCE (most often drugs) from a ""secure"" evidence lock-up room in order to personally gain (selling drugs) or in some cases change the outcome of an investigation (documents disappeared, defendant missing his solid piece of evidence). If that individual is risking criminal charges to interfere with evidence, then it can be easily assumed that a civil servant or minister would risk the same (or lesser charges, since they can hide behind the ""lost"" excuse every time).

I don't deny that there are plenty of inefficient and inept staff and procedures within the civil service and especially in the archives. However, if these problems can happen time and time again - even purely by accident as you suggest - then a complete overhaul needs to be made and new systems put in place.

true,chriskmanx,null,null,"Ok my comments were obviously intended to inflame - to stir dialogue. So I need to be able to take what I dole out. So be it. So then...

If the Euro is off the table. And for the sake of Scotland I hope it is, what is plan B? Unilaterally adopt the Pound ? Ok, but does anyone here understand how a fiat monetary system really works? 

Prior to World War I, it worked like this: Governments issued money and injected it into their respective economies through spending - executive privilege if you like. It also got countries like Germany into significant trouble when government didn't exercise restraint. Hyperinflation ensued, giving rise to a dictator and subsequently to World War II. 

About the same time, governments around the world learned a lesson and went to a reserve banking system. Canada, Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom all adopted this around the same time. Money is still issued in a similar way, but now by a system of one or more reserve banks. Governments issue bonds in return for the issuance of money and raise taxes to re-pay those bonds. Individual banks actually create money through deposits. This works because you and I can pay with our deposits (by writing cheques on them) without needing access to the original notes and coins. This too would result in hyperinflation German style if it were not for the so called reserve requirement. Banks have to keep a fractional reserve for deposits they hold. Otherwise an infinite amount of money would be created. So how much money is created? That depends on the reserve rate because banks can also borrow reserves. Simplified: if the reserve rate is 10%, then a bank with $10 of reserves, can have a total of $100 in deposits. It will lend those out to businesses and consumers in the economy to make more from lending than what it pays depositors for their deposits. If the reserve rate is lowered, then the bank can make money from the spread between the reserve rate and the retail rate by lending more. In effect this increases the amount of money in circulation without printing extra notes and coins. Banks have a special license to access funds at this reserve rate. In the United States that is called the ""Fed Window."" In the UK, it is the Bank of England. The astute reader will wonder if there is a hole in this system. If the reserve bank can print money and give it to government in return for bonds, which are then repaid by tax payers, then .... the reserve bank is getting money for nothing. It is and the law says it must return in the neighbourhood of  97% to the treasury which is to say it returns its profits minus a small operating margin to the government. Conspiracy theorists usually wake up to the first half of this logic but miss the second part. 

So what does it all mean? If the economy is down and lending is to be cheaper to encourage business, the reserve bank lowers interest rates, thereby increasing the amount of money in circulation, encouraging the creation of jobs. By contrast, if inflationary pressures exist, the reserve bank will raise interests rates to lower the amount of money in circulation. All this will also effect foreign exchange rates and you will have guessed it, it better be in tune with government policies on the economy. If monetary policy says turn left and government steers to the right, our little horse and carriage run off the road. This is what happened to Greece and Spain. 

So if Alex Salmond intends to unilaterally keep the Pound, then Scots are better advised to listen to Paul Krugman http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/08/opinion/paul-krugman-scots-what-the-heck.html?_r=0

A Scotland taking on the Pound unilaterally would not be able to count on access to the equivalent of the ""Fed Window"" or the Bank of England, like English banks would be. Moreover, remember that apparent hole in the system that turned out it wasn't? Imagine if Canada used the US Dollar. All other things being equal Canadian taxes would be raised to repay bonds going into the US reserve system who would then direct it's profits to whom? The US treasury ! Get it ? Canadian workers working for the US government ? So if Scotland does not have a reserve banking system in which it participates, then Scottish workers' taxes ultimately go to a foreign power who is under no obligation to repatriate those fund to Scotland. Also banks based in Scotland would not be guaranteed access to the Sterling reserve system. Consequently I predict that simply all your banks will move south of the border. How will Scotts feel when they apply for a home loan and there are only English banks to approve or disapprove ? 

I suggest Alex present a clear solution to the money problem. Not hype or supposition, but clear agreed solutions. Simply spouting that Scotland won't pay it's share of the national debt, will only accelerate the exodus of banking. If Alex does not present an AGREED solution, then he is misleading Scotland in the worst possible manner.

This is just so illogical. A referendum/election *determines* the majority view. That's the point. What is this ""majority view"" you talk about? Where is the referendum or election to back up your claim? You can't just say, ""that's how it is now, and we haven't changed it, therefore it must be the majority view"".

To come to a conclusion on what the majority view is, you have to hold a referendum or at least a poll. But even a poll doesn't count because it's not official, just like any independence poll doesn't count until the actual *official* referendum.

I want a referendum or poll or election to determine the majority view. You don't. You are happy to say that the current status quo represents the majority view, which is just so illogical. If you can't see that, then there's nothing more to say.

And suddenly your little scheme grows teeth and claws.  Sanctions for those that don't show the required amount of willing yes?

&gt; You're also taking everything I have to say in absolute terms.

Because that is how such schemes are currently run, in absolutes.  You do X actions.  You attend Y hours of Z activity.  You're the one who said 15 hours per week of community service so you started off with an absolute.

&gt; There's a million ways you could make it work.

Making it work and having it work are two different things.  With a big enough engine even a brick will fly, it just won't be in any way shape or form efficient or effective.   

&gt; Organisations get certified to show they need people to do some form of un paid community work that is not a position they already employ people in.

New Deal had that.  As I said it wasn't the people on benefits that were busy manufacturing the positions.

&gt; Instead of this pussyfooting around why don't you just admit you're on benefits and you don't much like the idea of having to do something for the community who's supporting you? 

Because I paid my NI.    Of course, here you are arguing on the internet at 11am.  It's nowhere near when lunch hours usually are.   Et Tu Mr. Kettle?

&gt; Seriously, just admit it. Admit you have a bias on this.

Of course I have a bias and so do you.  I realise how such schemes are actually run and the mechanics of them, hell as I originally stated charities pay well if you aren't one of the doe eyed students roped in to do a 'good deed' on the streets.  My bias is simply this:

Someone will be paid to take one of these ""volunteers"" of yours.  They were paid to take the ""volunteers"" on New Deal.  They were paid to take the ""volunteers"" on Workfare.  These 'make the unemployed work' schemes only work when their is a cash incentive being given to the 'employer', that makes such schemes a fairly expensive proposition when compared to stock benefit payments.

Money from oil comes from 3 main areas;

* 1) **[Petroleum Revenue Tax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_revenue_tax)** - this is levied against profits made by oil extraction in the British portion of the North sea. This is what you are talking about and where the £4.7bn figure comes from.

* 2) **Corporation Tax** - In addition to petroleum revenue tax (PRT) all companies must also pay corporation tax (although PRT is allowed to be deducted from a companies operating profit before corporation tax is applied). Since most of the oil is and still will be sold on London exchanges that is where the tax is levied - it's a big deal because in 2012 it contributed about 40% of the amount paid in PRT (which makes sense since PRT is levied at 50% and corporation tax is levied at about 26% I think.

* 3)  **Income Tax** - In order to extract oil from the north sea companies have to pay people to go and work on these big things called oil rigs. Those workers get paid income which is then taxed. That tax money depends on (among other things) where that individual is paid. This is probably fairly insignificant in comparison to the first two - and any benefit it has is probably more locally in areas where the petroleum industry is present, in supporting local business and such by providing industry and wages. 

So, whilst Scots could control (maybe up to) about 90% of the Petroleum Revenue Tax they are unlikely to profit significantly from Corporation tax since few Scottish companies extract significant amounts of oil. 

&gt; The UK parliament puts a lot of scope on it, particularly Michael Grove.

Well, it's good to know the Chief Whip of the Conservative party - effectively responsible for discipline within the party, and formerly education secretary values credit ratings. Of course it would be slightly more important if George Osborne cares. I'm not sure why you cite Gove. By extension you could make the case that Simon Cowell things they're very important. At any rate, I don't want to get into a big barney about ratings agencies since everyone else except you thinks they are a bygone. The fact that one ratings agency published a report which you seem to have taken to be some sort of *Gospel of a future Scotland* doesn't make them genuinely important. There are lots of reports. I prefer to believe the ONS over a ratings agency at any rate... and the ONS numbers don't lie. Scottish profits from oil would amount to less then 1% of total UK public spending and that is likely to be offset by losses elsewhere (particularly the loss of the generous Barnett Formula).

You can't ask PF these enormous sweeping quandaries and then expect any meaningful response unless it's cut to its bare bones. 

Had the question been : I have this plot of land ... or I'm intent on designing my own property ... or some other qualifier ... then the advice can be better factored.

&gt; No, it actually hasn't. The BBC has made this claim, and you believe it for some reason.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;A referendum/election determines the majority view.

But we already know the majority view. The above examples you give are not the only options.

&gt;Where is the referendum or election to back up your claim? 

Are you going to address the public reaction over the past few years to the Jubilee/ Wedding/ Baby in order to back up yours? I could assert that trees were unpopular because nobody's held a referendum about it. Does that mean I'm right?

&gt;You can't just say, ""that's how it is now, and we haven't changed it, therefore it must be the majority view"".

But I'm not - I'm listing easily-verified examples of popularity;the street parties, celebrations and stuff for the Wedding - it's been the case for decades past. It's not news. But even if we stick to just the past five years - the Jubliee, etc....how would you justify the cost of a referendum to get a result that's already well known and easily verified in several ways? Remember, you'd actually need a referendum of the commonwealth countries as well, considering they tend to like the royals too - if the goal was to confirm how popular they are.

&gt;To come to a conclusion on what the majority view is, you have to hold a referendum or at least a poll. 

No necessarily, certainly not when there's overwhelming public support for this kind of thing. Did nobody turn up for the Jubilee? Did nobody watch the Wedding on TV? Do the newspapers print royal-news every other day just to fill pages, and nobody actually reads them? Are all the tourist shops in London full of royal tea-towels and stuff just to fill space and haven't really sold for thirty years? Faced with all that, it's not logical to then assert the royals cannot be considered popular without a referendum.

There are simply so many indicators of their popularity, the only reason someone would *still* insist on a referendum is because of their own agenda, not the popular will.

&gt;I want a referendum or poll or election to determine the majority view. You don't.

I've justified why one isn't necessary. You've avoided addressing that several times.

&gt;You are happy to say that the current status quo represents the majority view, which is just so illogical.

Demonstrate the logic of ignoring the public reaction to the above events in order to ask them if they're happy about them. Show me the lack of viewers for the televised events. Explain why there was a Jubilee Party in Hyde Park that went on for over a week. Seriously, you can't ignore so many pointers and then complain that my using them as examples of popularity is somehow illogical.

&gt;If you can't see that, then you're obviously too set in your ways

Sure, that *must* be it. Asking for proof?

&gt;and it's pointless to try any amount of reason of logic with you.

I certainly don't recall the BBC saying any such thing, though I only have access to their online site.

To be frank, moving their registered HQ is more important than moving jobs and staff in any case, and the flock of financial institutions moving to retain their status as a UK-Registered business is hardly a vote of confidence just because the admin staff are still in Scotland.

Salmond's argument regarding this seems to be:
""this is bad news for the YES campaign, so you shouldn't've released it"" but if it's true, it's true, and so he's basically saying he wants important information withheld from the public in order to make his campaign look more reasonable.
He insists that everything is scaremongering, but everything about being an independent country seems to scare him. He wants all of the benefits, but insists that all of the downsides are 'English scaremongering'.

Simply put, Salmond is basically a Scottish UKIP analogue. Whereas English right-wingers criticise their next biggest organisation, the EU, Scottish right-wingers criticise their next biggest organisation, the UK. Leaving the EU would ruin the UK, and leaving the UK would ruin Scotland, but if you can blame your woes on someone who talks differently or was born across the wrong border, then wahey, let's all throw ourselves in the toilet.

Hello? £67k for a job that allows you to take on a second job and get paid just as much is NOT a low wage.

MP's wages are set to rise to 74k. That's more than a NHS speciality doctor earns for working much harder and longer. Some MP's are still in their 20s and 30s - there's currently about 30-40 MP's who are 35 or under.

If you want to be an MP then you should start at the bottom like the rest of us in difficult and challenging jobs.

I also ran the entertainments section of Crisis Christmas for a few years too. I don't have a problem with giving back at all. This we obviously agree on. 

I just think there's a big difference between volunteering your own time and being ""volunteered"" by a system for something you have no control over or suffering sanctions because you refused.

This is my main issue with this, it essentially IMO belittles and takes away control from those who are already down on their luck and are already suffering a lack of control over their own lives in the first place. 

 I will add that as someone also studying addiction physcology to help with my peer mentoring, that lack of self control over your life is one of the worst things a person can experience when they're already down; it essentially kicks the shit out of your self-esteem and makes you feel that you've hit rock bottom with no way back up. 

I mean, I may be looking too much into this, but that's how I would have felt when I was signing on if I was suddenly volunteered ( on top of all the other shit going on )  for something I did not want to do. 

That, in a nutshell, is my issue with this.

true,Gervatheist,null,null,"I have a feeling that this isn't going to be very popular, but it is only my opinion and that is what is being asked for.

My overall general opinion is that I am still warming to Capaldi/Twelve.

At this very early stage, I think Smith was a much better Doctor than Capaldi.

I think that Smiths introduction was better than Deep Breath.

So, that was the basic overview, let me divulge.

I get the impression that it may be somewhat ""cool"" for fans to state that they love Capaldi, that he is the best Doctor, how much better he is than Smith- almost to the point of now trashing Smith and the Eleventh, which to me is ludicrous, and to make the connection between Capaldi and ClassicWho.

Personally, I feel that Smith really embodied everything about the character and gave the character, and role, a whole new quality that had been absent previously.

For me, I think there is too much emphasis on the ""dark side"" of the Doctor and too much praise being heaped on Capaldi for his interpretation of this. I think personally that Capaldi wouldn't be able to pull off the happy go-lucky, loveable Doctor that Smith and to a certain extent Tennant brought with them, and therefore there is no other option than for him to be this darker, shadier Doctor. There is absolutely zero spark or connection between Twelve and Clara, or between Twelve and the extended gang at this point- it all seems very forced, whereas with Smith his allies seemed as though they genuinely would do anything for him at the drop of a hat.

Part of the charm of The Doctor is that he is able to command respect, whilst earning it and not demanding it- whereas it seems to me that Twelve is very much of the ilk that I am the Doctor, you will respect me whether you like it or not whereas Eleven would have the air of respect around him, whilst proving to you that he deserved it in a cheeky- I told you so kind of way.

true,Kyusu,cnty-scotland,Fucksticks,"One of my closest friends lives in Scotland. We met on another island, a much hotter island, a long time ago and we have forged a friendship that has spanned years and might now span a border. When I go to visit him I have strange conversations with him and his friends; I have conversations about their country’s future as if they are actually involved in it as opposed to being silent participants. They talk about politics as if they have a say in it, as if they actually have an opportunity to decide not only their future but their countries future.


It’s refreshing and remarkable and completely alien to me. This is what democracy should be- inclusive and engaging, “were all in this together” seems to be a potential reality in Scotland instead of a hilarious-if-it-wasn’t-so-sad Tory lie as it is in Britain.


He and his friends talk about their futures, not with the resigned acceptance that my English and Welsh friends speak of them with, but with passion and trepidation. They talk about their futures as if they could be anything they choose to make them.


Current and recent British Governments have taught my generation that democracy in Britain barely works and that politics is completely inaccessible to anyone but the elite. I watched as people protested against the disastrous war in Iraq on an unprecedented scale but were then ignored. I was there the day that students and teenagers protested against a rise in tuition fees and a betrayal of an electoral pledge made directly to the youth of the nation. On that day I watched as the government’s police beat us down like dogs in the street, I watched grown men on police horses charge teenage girls and confine us to the indignity of kettling. That was the message the government sent to a whole British generation about democracy: you can have whatever you want as long as it’s what the government of millionaires wants. The full consequences of that selfishness are still waiting to appear but were ominously hinted at by 2011’s summer riots. The message that democracy doesn’t work is a phenomenally dangerous message to send to a generation of debt ridden, well-educated young people.


The United Kingdom is a construct steeped in imperialism and hereditary royalty. The weight of this past, having not been shaken off through, peaceful or otherwise, struggle casts a long shadow over the nation to this day. We still don’t have a written constitution, we are ruled by a political elite drawn from a narrow number of private schools, an unelected second chamber and a royal family that still holds unwarranted political sway. The very presence of the Royal Family tacitly condones elitism. A privately educated wealthy elite that only makes up 7% of Britain currently makes up 71% of senior judges, 62% of senior armed forces and 55% of permanent secretaries. That is the legal, military and political power bases of the UK all ran by people that went to the same schools as each other. Add these figures to the “cabinet of millionaires” and the raft of career politicians from the same backgrounds and schools and you get to the root problem of British society – that we haven’t actually come that far from the days of the aristocracy.


This truth is increasingly obscured by UK youth employment figures and improving economic statistics that are wafted by biased, privately owned media like smoke screens in front of a docile, financially castrated public to hide or help ignore the financial instability and growing alienation of an entire generation from the nation, and from Westminster, that will undoubtedly form the narrative of our times. The political class of Britain taught my generation that gaining change through the system, though sorely needed, is all but impossible and the people of Scotland watched them ignore us or beat and arrest us. So now Scotland is trying to leave the system, the momentum of the Yes campaign is accelerated by the grassroots support and young people, the very people politicians ignore and continue to ignore.


If Scotland stays in the United Kingdom, what awaits it? Austerity, the continuing privatization of Britain at the expense of the working class, the sale of national assets and services, the creeping dismantling of the welfare state, disastrous and pointless foreign wars, necessary and expensive foreign wars and, most heinous of all, the continuing erosion of participation and belief in democracy and more youth nihilism.


The new wave of politicians that also await a Scotland in the Union are now more removed from the rest of society than ever. They mostly have limited interchangeable professional backgrounds and even more limited social backgrounds. They are identikit “career” politicians with the new generation sometimes adding a touch of “they’re the best looking of a bad bunch” looks to the mix. They no longer have rich (in the original sense of the word) and varied backgrounds but similar, interchangeable – regarding school, university or political persuasion- backgrounds. How much in common does the majority of the country- from the schemes of Scotland and council estates of Liverpool to the suburbs of Kent have in common with these people? None. They have proved themselves in neither hard graft, nor gritty conflict, nor shrewd business. They have only proved themselves adept at Westminster backslapping and backstabbing. They have lived isolated and for the most part privileged lives where hugging a hoody is a risk free endeavor and eating a pasty is a novelty. To anyone outside of the Westminster bubble these people’s position of power is as inexplicable as their reason for being there and the lack of accessibility to politics for the average person only further degrades faith in British democracy.


In Scotland though, the independence debate is igniting a fire in the banal embers of the democratic process. A whole country is having a realistic say in how their country will be governed outside of the ethically and morally bankrupt con-dem-lab political world of the United Kingdom.


The island I met my Scottish friend on also sought independence from Britain and was subjected to the same barrage of fear mongering rhetoric that, once you peel away the fear, is merely a list of bureaucratic and administrative intricacies. Support for the Yes campaign is only boosted by the No campaigns tactics. Its constant use of fear, that oft wielded tool of the Conservative, only serves to further push the grass roots supporters towards the yes vote. The arguments of the No campaign are tinged with images of an economic apocalypse that is an insult to the intelligence and industrious character of the Scottish people, or for that matter any people. The No campaign has successfully turned the campaign into a choice between Conservative fear and Scottish courage.


This leads us to an interesting question. Why does the right of Britain want to keep Scotland? David Cameron has an obvious and vain personal desire to not be the Prime Minister that “let Scotland leave”, forever tarnishing his unremarkable premiership. After all, Scotland constantly and consistently votes majority Labour. Why would the right not want to dispense of an immense left power base? Is it because a Yes vote will mean that, north of the wall, the people are instantly rid of the City of London and its corrupting greedy influence, the hereditary second chamber, the poisonous and elite-legitimising influence of the royals, the public school network, Britain’s chronic wealth imbalance and all of those other forces that are woven into the fabric of the British state but superfluous to its function and hindering to its progress? It is because the rest of us left in the Union will look over the wall to those who refuse to kneel, and will see that a better way is possible. It’s just a shame that we are going to have to lose a part of our nation to realise this, but this shows just how entrenched the current system has become.


Scottish independence is about a lot more than self determination for Scotland. It is about breaking away from the silent and accepted inequality of the UK. It is about a genuine step into the 21st century. It is about leaving the 4th most unequal country in the world and living in a country were 1% of the population does not hold as much wealth as 55% of the population. An independent Scotland can satisfy its population’s desire for social progress and give people a meaningful opportunity to change their lives through democracy. It is putting everyone back into the democratic process and letting young people feel like they have a part to play in the crafting of their country’s and their own future.


Will it be an uncertain future? Yes (but why is that a bad thing? Uncertainty is the foundation of the new). Will it be hard work? Yes. Will it be worth it? Yes, if Scotland wants it to be.


Vote yes Scotland. Do it for us all, north and south of Hadrian’s Wall. Go your own way and show us all that there is a better way, that democracy doesn’t just belong to the rich and that we can all have a say in the future of our nations. Vote yes to rid yourselves of this nepotistic, greedy, corrupt perversion of democracy that we have now. Vote yes and show us that there can be a fairer society. Vote yes and show this generation that they can change things and that it can be done through the democratic process. Stay and you will have a future of austerity, cuts and a widening wealth divide. Leave and you will have a chance to save your young people’s futures by giving them all something to build in a new Scotland.",0,1410520353,null,0,false,0,ckg6m9e,t3_2g6qm1,t1_ckg6m9e,t3_2g6qm1,null,1427054417,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,AidanSmeaton,cnty-scotland,Glasgow,"See, these are unknowns but they're not fundamental to the question ""Should Scotland be an independent country?"" and I think it's reasonable to believe that pragmatic solutions will be found as and when negotiations take place.

&gt; Will Scotland be considered part of the EU?

Only the UK Gov can ask this question, which they have refused to do because they do not want to pre-negotiate the breakup of the Union.

&gt; Will they have to reapply?

Probably not, but we need the UK Gov to ask which they won't do. Scotland has been a member of the EU for 40 years as part of the UK. EU citizens live and work here, Scottish citizens live and work in the EU. We are a net contributor, and supply resources including fishing waters, farming, and energy. UKIP came 4th in Scotland (not first) in May, so we don't want to leave. It's in the EU's interest to keep us as well.

&gt; How does that affect trade between EU countries in the mean time and Scots abroad?

We need the UK Gov to ask, which they won't.

&gt; Will they have enough money to continue offering free-university and health care?

Over the past 5 years, despite having 8% of the population, Scotland has contributed almost 10% of treasury revenues. It gets a smaller share of expenditure back. Scotland is not subsidised by the rest of the UK and will continue to prioritise health and education in its budget. It has the opportunity to enshrine these in a written constitution to guarantee it for future generations. There are no guarantees if the Scottish budget is slashed by Westminster.

&gt; People won't give two hoots about some guy named Cameron and how the Scots shafted him

Not just Cameron. Thatcher, Blair, Brown, Cameron, and the whole Westminster establishment.

&gt; And will they (the Scots) be thinking ""Our Mums and Dads knew what they were doing !"" or will they be saying ""That was a bad decision !""

They could say that *either way*. I believe they will be better off growing up in an independent Scotland.",0,1410520567,null,0,false,0,ckg6nt4,t3_2g3cxv,t1_ckg6nt4,t1_ckg6ekr,null,1427054396,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1
true,LazyGit,null,null,"**Close all the Jobcentres**

They're unnecessary. The country is full of businesses that exist solely to place people in jobs (resource agencies) and the people who do that work are incentivised with money to get people out of unemployment. Jobcentre staff are supposed to be helping get people into work but are incentivised with the threat of punishments to get people off benefits. At this stage, Jobcentres are a work programme for Jobcentre workers.

**Sell all the social housing**

The concept of social housing is that the local authority owns property that it can lease to those in need at subsidised amounts. Why? Are there social farms to provide people with cheap food? Social power stations? Social clothes makers? And when those in need are no longer in need, why are they not turfed out? If the councils really need to find housing for people, let them rent it from private landlords. If they think the costs are too high, let them use their planning powers to release more land for housebuilding and to force the sale of derelict land for housebuilding.

**Flat unemployment benefit**

Cap benefits nationwide at some amount below minimum wage and just pay it to people. No messing around. If you aren't working at all, you get all the benefit. If you are working 17.5 hours a week, you get half the benefit etc. It will always work out better to work than not work but you won't live in poverty if you're not working (unless you make terrible decisions with your money).

**End sanctions**

Just to be clear, if you're unemployed the benefits will be paid to you no questions asked. It will be your responsibility to find a job. If you would rather subsist on the meagre amount you're given then that will be your choice. There would still of course be all the normal rules regarding benefit fraud.

**No more housing benefit**

Again, just to be clear, there will be no housing benefit. You will be given an amount of money each *month* and you will do as you see fit with it. Let's say it's £800.00 per month. If you want to live in London, you can pay £600.00 rent and try to live off the rest of it, or you can move somewhere you can afford to live and have more money to live on while you look for work.

I can see that deposits and agency fees will be a problem. The local authorities will be obliged to loan money to people on benefits to pay such fees. I wonder how long it will take for letting agents to be properly regulated when the government has to start dealing with their bullshit.

**Free nursery care nationwide**

We have a system where childcare is essentially free from 5 to 18 but before the age of 5 you either don't work so you can look after your kids or pay private school prices to get someone else to look after them. When it becomes practical for parents to be out of the house when their child is young, it makes it easier for them to get into the job market. It should also encourage more young middle-class people to have kids, knowing that it won't cripple their finances.

**Land value tax**

In simple terms, if you own housing property that is not your home, you pay some percentage of the property value in tax per year. I don't know what that amount would be, it obviously wouldn't be so much that renting it out would be totally impractical and it wouldn't be so low that it has no impact. Considering the effect Tobin taxes have had, I would suggest that even 0.5% would have a significant effect.",0,1410520587,null,0,false,0,ckg6ny2,t3_2g52w9,t1_ckg6ny2,t3_2g52w9,null,1427054394,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

that doesn't factor in the land or planning etc. but it is financially viable IF you can secure the land at a sensible price, and navigate the planning process. as you correctly state, financing would be a challenge.

the main reasons that more people don't do this is that undeveloped (but developable) land is scarce, and buying land with a house on it to demolish and rebuild isn't economic. also, planning is pretty restrictive in this country and building a house that differs at all from a house that already exists in that spot is not straightforward.",0,1410521348,null,0,false,0,ckg6tt1,t3_2g6apw,t1_ckg6tt1,t1_ckg31lw,null,1427054318,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

true,thecosmicpope,scot-Angus,Angus,"I'm voting Yes. However I believe the end result will be a No vote, and if the majority votes No then I have to accept that my side did not win and be happy with what I have.

Reason for voting Yes: I believe Scotland and England are too different politically for one government to rule us with blanket laws like we have. I believe a federal system like the states might be a better option, but we will not get that, so I believe both the UK and Scotland will be represented more accurately if we are separated.

If it's a Yes I am not expecting money to fall from the sky and everything to be rosy. At best it's going to be hard work. At worst, we might be worse off. However at the end of that, we can sit and say Scotland was in charge of itself and we are responsible for it. We won't be able to sit and blame the Tories like we always do, because it'll be our choice, and our parties. I believe the same will happen in England, as Scotlands left voting will no longer swing the English vote down the middle. 

Will we be better off financially? This sub likes to quote some financial experts, but also ignore others. The experts all disagree. So will we be? Don't know. But I believe that's our choice to make.

I also believe that the very fact we have a referendum is a good thing for England, and the English should be embracing this as an opportunity to say ""look, we as a nation are not happy. We need the government to go sort it"". Instead this has been turned into in-fighting and abuse in the media, and I honestly believe a golden opportunity has been missed by anyone in England who is unhappy with the way things work in this country.

I am unhappy with how my country is run, and I see this as our chance to change that. And I see it as Englands chance to throw their hands up too and shout ""You know what? The Scots are right.

true,IanCal,eng-manchester,Manchester - City of Science,"&gt; I could not believe that the sheer amount of ""accidents"" every time these key documents have vanished are all down to inept archiving.

Without knowing the rates of recall and loss it's impossible to say if it's surprising. I have absolutely no idea how many documents are stored, accessed and what rate of ""loss"" there is dating back over the last 15 years.

How many documents are successfully found, even limiting to a similar level of importance? Even in this case in particular, how many ""key documents"" are there and how many were found? 

Saying ""sheer number"" or ""plenty of instances"" is irrelevant unless you look at the proportions. I don't know them, nor do I know where to get the figures, do you have them?

&gt; the archives are set up within incredibly bureaucratic systems of checks and doublechecks so that these ""mistakes"" cannot happen in the first place

Are they? When you wrote this, did you know he actual archival procedures of councils? I don't. 

&gt; However, if these problems can happen time and time again - even purely by accident as you suggest - then a complete overhaul needs to be made and new systems put in place.

Not before we know any actual figures because otherwise we'll have no idea what the problem is. Do you actually need a complete overhaul? 

I think people jumping to ""OH GREAT ANOTHER CONSPIRACY"" is unproductive though. If the statistics I want don't exist, they bloody well should. If they do exist, then we can actually answer the questions people are raising.

No he isn't, and yet he still spends that kind of money on a hotel. Why aren't the shareholders revolting?

&gt;The point you don't seem to want to grasp because of what appears to be fierce regal loyality 

I have an affection for them, that's about it - haven't been to any royal processions or anything like that. I can be convinced either for or against, but the againsts (at least on reddit) don't appear to have gotten past only considering the factors that fit with their pre-determined opinion. 

&gt;is that if the Royals are creating so much wealth then why aren't we seeing this as a news item.

Why would we? It's not really news...if someone had found real, credible evidence that they were either abusing their power (not that they can, but just for this example), or that they were an astonishing drain on the coffers, the press wouldn't let it go in these times of austerity...so the question can be reversed with more legitimacy than asking why we're not being regularly told how much they bring in.

&gt;The Palace PR machine is pretty good at producing endless cheesy photos

This actually highlights another point - the palace PR machine produce endless pics, and yet the press all take their own as well anyway; if the royals are unpopular to the point of needing a referendum, why would this be going on at all?

&gt;yet somehow goes all shy when in comes to blowing the financial trumpet for its clients.

I'm not sure they have a need to - it's not like they have to *push* a royal visit on another country, but more than that it's worth remember that trade is not their primary reason for continued existence - it could be considered more of a side-benefit.

&gt;Either this is a massive failure by Palace PR inc or it simply doesn't happen on the sort of scale you are implying...

I'm not sure they actually need the PR on that kind of front - and as I pointed out, their reason for existence isn't primarily to conduct business and I'm not sure anyone would want them to be presented like that as a priority over their other duties.

Build more houses? Money and land has to come from somewhere. Also help to buy already incentivises new builds. You have to ensure people will buy as well so you can't cut the buyers incentive else the developers would stop building.

&gt; The Treasury has pledged to honour all UK debts up to the date of Scotland's independence in an effort to reassure investors and stop interest rates rising.

This doesn't mean what you seem to think it means. The Treasury is saying that whatever happens, bondholders will get their money. That says nothing about what UKG is likely to agree to in the negotiations.

Firstly, how is this going to be portrayed in England? Quite rightly, the idea of taking on Scotland's share of the debt is going to be portrayed as everyone in England paying £3,000 in order to give every Scot £30,000. There's simply no way on Earth any English politician (or voter) will accept that.

Let's think about potential scenarios...

1\. Let's go straight to the chase, and assume intransigence on both sides. If the pre-independence negotiations stall, then independence will simply be postponed indefinitely.

Let's be clear, I'm not suggesting that any particular politician will be intransigent. Whoever is PM will be simply unable to deliver £30k free pounds for every Scot. There's almost certainly going to be a Commons vote on the English side of the agreement. But unless the negotiations are *extremely* straightforward, it's more likely calls for an English referendum will be irresistible. A House of Commons with Scottish MPs will simply be seen as not qualified to vote on the English side of the deal.

What then? Might Scotland declare UDI? That's possible, but then you'll be waving goodbye to any hope of joining any organisation where the UK has a veto. UN? EU? WTO? It's just unthinkable.

2\. OK so on to possible agreements. The obvious route to splitting the debt would be to simply reassign responsibility for 8% of the outstanding Gilts to Scotland. But which 8%? I'm guessing that bondholders would expect a premium for agreeing to transfer their debt, which would instantly push up the effective interest rates of Scottish borrowing. Perhaps the Scottish side would accept that, but it wouldn't be an easy pill to swallow.

3\. Instead of splitting the outstanding debt, Scotland could write new ""Scottish Bonds"" to the value of £110bn and give them to England. This seems appealingly simple, but again it will lead to increased borrowing costs for Scotland. That's because the rUK will want to divest itself of this mountain of bonds, for the sake of de-risking its portfolio. So, both Scotland *and England* will be trying to sell Scottish bonds on the open market - that's inevitably going to depress the price.

Worse, it means that England will effectively have a veto on Scottish borrowing. If we wanted to put up the cost, we'd just sell more bonds. A responsible Scottish negotiating team won't agree to that!

4\. Perhaps England would agree to an asset transfer, in lieu of Scotland paying its share of the debt. What does Scotland have that might be worth £110bn? Perhaps North Sea oil? Although that might be a fairish swap on paper, I can't see the Scottish public standing for it - the oil has such an emotional connection for them.

All of this is complicated by the currency issue - a currency union would make the debt-sharing scenarios easier to implement, but would give each country a large amount of control over the others finances. It's obvious that the Scots feel that's acceptable, but I think you've underestimated how badly that would go down in England. Personally, I'm all for the Euro, but most of my countrymen disagree - and the stability pact that goes with the Euro is much looser than anything that would sensibly accompany a GBP currency union.

Finally, I think the real problem here is that Cameron agreed to this referendum, without insisting on nailing down what will happen in the case of a ""yes"" vote. The negotiation process is extremely ill-defined, which allows ""yes"" supporters to imagine that they might get whatever they demand. If it were made clear that the negotiations must conclude with a popular referendum on each side (which will effectively be the case), then I think that ""yes"" supporters might have a more realistic idea of what might be achieved.",0,1410524879,null,0,1410525084,0,ckg7p1k,t3_2g520g,t1_ckg7p1k,t1_ckg56b4,null,1427053758,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

And despite things like the Oklahoma bombing, they never seemed to associate that as terrorism. The UK at that point had only just come out of a 35-year terrorist war, so we were in many ways used to the kind of paranoia it engenders.

Secondly it was the first time for well over 100 years that there had been a military attack on US citizens in the USA itself. America of course fought in Vietnam, and the two World Wars, but for all living Americans who weren't in the military war had always been something that happened in foreign countries. Whereas for Europeans, although for most redditors WW2 is of course history, most of us still know of family members who would've fought in the war, we'll know of places in our home towns that were bombed in the war, and so on.

For example; the cash incentive didn't go to the benefit claimant in any way shape or form, it went to the employer.  To compensate for being in 'work mode' and the additional expenses that would incur JSA payments were topped up for the duration of the 6 month placement.   After 6 months the company HAD to offer you the job you had been doing.

Problem.  Few checks were put in to place beyond a company (or charity) saying they needed a spud to do something.  Whilst there were supposed to be more in depth checks made the system was so utterly swamped that only a cursory glance was given.

Problem: The cash incentive was per person and somewhere around the £2,500 per month mark. 

Can you guess what happened?  A whole lot of companies appeared, wanted staff and took on New Dealers for 5 months at which point, quite inexplicably, there was a insurmountable problem with them (suddenly racism or similar) and they were sent away (usually sanctioned as well).  As the vacancy is still there... another New Dealer was dispatched.

- All MPs not based within say an hour or two of London by definition need to live in two places. They have to have a constituency residence, and they also have to be at Parliament regularly. This has an effect on family life in particular.

- Many MPs will have campaigned with their families supporting them. Often a husband or wife will be one of their main staff before getting elected, simply because when they started out it was natural. Maybe they work really well together as a team? Maybe they even specifically got in to politics as a team? It could be a genuine working relationship.

- MPs should be paid well to prevent it becoming impossible for less well off MPs to exist. If they got paid almost nothing then becoming an MP is risky for someone with low net worth, and still not at all risky for someone who is rich. On top of that, these are the people elected to run the country for us, it should be a relatively well paid job.

- MPs should use first class travel. In theory they are among the most important people in the country and their time is used in different ways. If they travel first class on a train so they can work on important government documents, I'm OK with that. On top of that, having had a job which involves a lot of travel, it gets pretty miserable and demotivating. (And many MPs again, by definition, have to travel from constituency to parliament on a regular basis)

Now, saying all that, all 4 are currently exploited, and there's no reason all 4 of those couldn't be handled in a better way. A government owned London residence; checks on the actual work performed by family members; benchmarking salaries against industry; scrutinising travel expenses better.

Improvements need to be made, my real point is that in the end, many of the things people see as ""perks"" simply have to exist by the nature of the job. If it wasn't for the fact that all politicians are clearly corrupt to some extent (even if just angling for positions after parliament), I think most people could live with these perks - or even see them as sensible.

TL;DR: Most of the perks MPs have are actually reasonable if they were used in a genuine way. Instead politicians are like all people are, they try to milk the system for everything it has.

I should also note that [house builders can get out of building affordable housing through various loopholes](http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2014/05/developers-able-demolish-affordable-housing-provision). As a private sector organisation they understandably care more about the return rather than their contribution to society, but when they're the only ones able to build it fucks things up.

The way we as a society have shifted to treating housing as a commodity rather than a right is scary. People in London who worked hard to buy their council house through the Right to Buy scheme are now being kicked out of the capital to make way for the only housing that makes money - luxury apartments. 

Neoliberal policy of letting the market decide is a failed experiment, and I think its disingenuous for any MP who supports these kinds of policies to moan about not being able to live in London.

true,vembevws,null,null,"&gt;1) why do we allow MP's to hire family members? It is not allowed anywhere else I can think of (except maybe private family businesses)

Well... it IS allowed almost everywhere else. 

But leaving that aside, many MPs start out as a grass roots politicians. Someone interested in getting involved but just starting out so no staff or anything - usually a family member will help scheduling meetings, printing leaflets etc.

It makes sense that once they get elected, they keep working with the same people. A husband and wife team can be extremely effective, often with their skills balancing eachother out - one is organised and the other is a good negotiator for example.

I have zero problem with politicians hiring family members, **if they can prove the family member is doing legitimate work.**

&gt;2) why don't we just give MP's a per-diem (so far as I know like Euro MP's) so this story can go away?

Think others have replied, but basically you have to set the per diem at a relatively high rate (because right now Scottish MPs have to travel the entire length of the country on a regular basis for example), which means for every day where they don't use it, they earn a nice tidy sum. EU MEPs are some of the biggest rip off merchants ever.

 [**Police and crime commissioner**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police%20and%20crime%20commissioner): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;A __police and crime commissioner__ is charged with securing efficient and effective policing of a [police area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_area) in [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England) and [Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales), and is elected for a four year term. The first incumbents were [elected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales_police_and_crime_commissioner_elections,_2012) on 15 November 2012. Commissioners replaced the now abolished [police authorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_authority).

&gt;Separate arrangements exist for [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London). Policing in [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland) and [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland) has been devolved to the [Scottish Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament) and [Northern Ireland Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Assembly), respectively. In Scotland, the [Cabinet Secretary for Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_Secretary_for_Justice) serves in a similar capacity for [Police Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Scotland) while in Northern Ireland, the [Minister of Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Justice_(Northern_Ireland\)) fulfills a similar role for the [Police Service of Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Service_of_Northern_Ireland).

&gt;The post of police and crime commissioner should not be confused with the police rank of ""Commissioner"", held by the chief police officers for the [Metropolitan Police Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police_Service) and the [City of London Police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London_Police), which cover the two police areas in London.

Having oil might be nothing but trouble for a young, independent Scotland with a fresh economy and investors at the doors. 

Edit - two further things. Comparing with Norway doesn't factor in that Scotland would compete with Norway... and Norway rules the roost in european gas and oil. Scotland would have to lower prices dramatically to compete... and even then they have a much smaller output.

Second the biggest buyer of Norways gas? That's the UK. Do you really believe Westminster will give independent Scots a fair deal? Or will they spite them and keep buying from Norway? Either way, good luck selling to number two, three, etc... Norway is closer to all and has better relations with.

1. Bush is going to make himself look even more stupid than normal trying to deal with this.

I don't think was was incorrect on any of those points looking back.

How has it changed things?

1. Air travel has gone from something to be looked forward to as the start of the holiday to being something I actively avoid whenever possible. Airport security was daft but somewhat understandable (mostly to ease peoples fears over flying), now it utterly an farcical theater piece that costs us an insane amount of money and time and provides next to no actual security.
2. Using terrorism as an excuse to spend money or justify some dodgy law has become far more the norm. ""Because terrorists"" like ""think of the children!"" has become a standard thing used to deflect rational debate. This already existed in part due to the IRA, but the 'Merkins have shown our politicians &amp; press the dizzing lows to which this can be pushed and we have moved far more into fear based policies.
3. My instinctive distrust of most politicians has turned into active dislike of most politicians. There were many factors for this, but the handling of the ""post 9/11 security climate"" (wars, dodgy laws and lack of accountability) has been a very large part of it and I think a good chunk of the rest of the population are with me on that.
4. Increases in racism, though somewhat area dependent. If you live somewhere where you come into regular contact with non-whites &amp; non-Christians then chances are it hasn't massively affected your views, but the constant demonisation of Muslims/Arabs/etc by the press and politicians has obviously scared many.

Not sure what your point is there. The UK's biggest trading partner is the US and they don't need seats in congress or the senate.

I understand that you've definitely not been following the campaign at all, because all of these points have been addressed, if not in the white paper then in the papers after people from NATO and EU have said that Scotland [would be welcomed with open arms](http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/scottish-independence-scots-welcome-in-nato-1-3529122). [EU - President Juncker's spokesman has said that Scotland's entry to the EU would be a special case, and that it would be fast-tracked rather than put on the waiting list, like Turkey etc.](http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/independence-juncker-sympathetic-to-scots-eu-bid-1-3482266).

It wasn't Scottish companies, it was the pound that went down against the dollar, because international investors started to sell off stocks they had in the pound. This is probably not due to them think iScotland is unfeasible, but because the UK government has created a lot of uncertainty around the pound. The Scottish government's position on a currency union is clear, but the UK government has refused to pre-negotiate, and so have not declared what their preferred currency is- a campaign tactic. That's why investors are unsure about the pound - will it be backed up by Scottish oil in 3 years time? who knows.

Not necessarily. I imagine Salmond would retire quite soon after independence (he's 59). Nicola Sturgeon would probably lead the SNP post independence, but they in all likelihood will end up dissolving into splinter parties since they are a mix of people with right and left political ideologies and would not have the unifying cause of independence. If people do not want him as the prime minister, then they won't vote for him. If they do, they will - that's how democracy works. But there will be plenty more opportunities for other people, particularly ruth davidson and patrick harvie, to aim for the top seat, due to it being a much more representative government. Just remember that this isn't about salmond, it's about getting a representative government that does what people in Scotland want it to do. It is not Alex Salmond's personal ego-inflator, no matter how much the newspapers might want to frame it as such.

A few major nations, particularly the US, have stated that it is not in their interest for the UK to break up. And that makes sense - the UK is one of their biggest allies, and rUK certainly would be diminished without Scotland. I don't think Scotland would be diminished without the UK though - and the US has not said that Scotland is better off in the UK, just that the UK would be diminished.

There is no sign that energy use is declining. Even if we all get 200w vacuum cleaners and give up ironing out clothes more and more cars are electric or plug-in hybrid, phones, tablets, ipods, laptops... all deliver more, but require more power to do so. Nobody remotely sensible is predicting a decline in energy use over the next 50 years. 

Now, if some genius at Princeton nails Solar efficiency and storage technology then we can all put a panel on our roof and run our everything... but let's not make policies based on pipe dreams, eh?

So given that energy demand is not going anywhere, and that our current crop of 70s power stations are a) falling apart and b) woefully inefficient, we need to replace them. 

Market economics would say that energy suppliers should pick up the cost as it's in their interest to supply the energy... but we don't actually do that, we underwrite and subsidise up the wazoo then give them all the profits. 

DSR is nonsense and would require a massive shift in the way we approach energy... as a long term strategy, great, and we'll have the technology to make it easier... but the need for more power plants is more immediate than that, and we can't possibly roll out 20 million smart meters and educate people on their use before we start suffering brown-outs.

Exactly.

The people who invented this scheme know this as well as we all do, which indicates to me that there are far more sinister reasons for doing it - such as inventing 'reasons' to sanction people, or creating some kind of bullshit 'work placement' scheme with big companies(who may just happen to be mates with those in government) by way of a government sanctioned form of slavery. What's next? The option of a taking a suicide pill if you are unable to find work within a set period of time? I swear I would only be mildly surprised if someone announced that.

Then he meets this human from 20th century earth and she just loves him for exactly who he is. She sees he's a man who tries to do good, and even with a bit of a dark side, makes him FEEL like he deserves to be the Doctor.

He regenerates based on that: he's a time lord who can do anything. He's boundless, he feels free from the guilt he's managed to bury. He's the last of the time lords (or so he thinks), and he's going to do all the things that need to be done.

He also realizes as he regenerates into 10, that he's down to two regenerations remaining before the show is all over. Sure, these can last hundreds, maybe thousands of years, but to a time lord, its still just two regenerations out of his previous 12. Time is running short. 

This, to me, is the explanation behind talking about all ""the good I could have done"", and why he ""doesn't want to go"". He'd never fallen for an earth human woman before, and it made this face feel special. He felt himself unstoppable until ""a time lord victorious"". It hit him right in the mid life crisis he was having, and reminded him the long lived time lords are not immortal, and his fate, however far staved off, was also approaching.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"I said it the other day, Spurs are a wet dream for someone looking to buy into the PL.

Look at the club....

- Very little debt

- Competitive club that has consistently been finishing in the top half of the table on a budget.

- Relatively large following both home and abroad.

- Successful marketing inroads setup to increase brand recognition in both NAM and APAC.

- Brand new training ground that was completed **BEFORE** FFP came into effect (So you don't need to pay for one to be built and have it count against you by FFP)

- Solid academy that can produce PL calibre players (though, as of yet, have not produced a ""world class"" player from the academy)

- New stadium in process of being built with all governmental red tape already figured out and land squared away, in **LONDON** (no need to pay to get new stadium built and no need to try and purchase land in one of the most expensive real estate cities on the planet)

- London has already bought into doing light ""gentrification"" of Tottenham area as part of new stadium deal. (so your shiny new investment won't be in a hell hole)

- Team is located IN LONDON, a massive market in it's own right but a draw for any foreign fans.

We are built to be a true ""Plug and Play"" purchase. All the hard stuff is dealt with, we have no debt, a quality squad that can compete at the upper half of the table and we have a new stadium on the way....the only things a new owner would need to do is invest in the squad as they see fit and invest in the overseas marketing to increase foreign revenue.

If you are someone looking to buy a PL team we check literally every single box.  This club (whether you love it or hate it) was very astutely built by businessmen who knew how to maximize investment.

I have no doubt that we would look to sell at some point...keep in mind that Uncle Joe is 77 years old, he isn't going to be around forever.  I still think that the *preference* would be to seek out a new owner(s) **AFTER** the stadium is completed when the price would likely be at it's maximum. But, should someone make a mind blowing offer i have no doubt we would listen.

In this case i think what has happened is that Levy/Lewis have been feeling out financing options for the stadium and they met with Cain Hoy....Cain Hoy took one look at Spurs and instead of wanting to help with funding have asked what it would take to purchase the club, we no doubt gave an astronomical figure (the reported £1 billion price tag for example) and Cain Hoy weren't as scared off as Levy/Lewis would have thought.

And now.....Cain Hoy is taking the talks public trying to rally support and force the hand of Levy/Lewis into giving a response or coming to the table for negotiations.  

This may have some legs....but this seems like the type of thing that would drag on for MONTHS if we are actually entertaining a sale.",0,1410532851,null,0,false,0,ckgardr,t3_2g76ua,t1_ckgardr,t3_2g76ua,null,1427052030,7,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,7

Just one tiny example of this, which basically wipes out the entire system of progressive taxation in a single hit is the impact of owning desirable property in good locations.  The wealthy pay about 5 times the lifetime tax of the poorest workers who live in rental properties, but during their lifetimes they get it all back and more in the capital gains on their houses.  So who pays for all the services they use?  The poorest workers living in rental properties. Now that's welfare!

true,Dardanator,null,null,"&gt; An independent Scotland would only require, and indeed want, a small defensive force.
&gt; Total defence budget would be £2.5bn which is about half the per capita spending of the UK Defence Budget.

If oil and gas is going to play a significant part in Scotland's economy, they will need a defence force that is sufficiently trained, staffed, equipped and mobile in order to provide the necessary level of protection to the rigs, which I assume are (and, in the case of future discoveries, will be) miles out at sea in all directions and a far distance from eachother. This is necessary even if only to the extent of reassuring the companies running the rigs that the areas are safe to do drilling in and not likely to be subject to any terrorist threat. Furthermore Scotland may find itself involved in UN (and NATO, should it join it) peace/security missions abroad. It is also worth remembering that armed forces do not just respond to military/terror threats, but also mobilise to provide rescue and aid in the event of disasters (eg large scale flooding).

Do the plans satisfy this? I don't know myself, but I'm wondering if this has ever been discussed and factored into scrutiny of the proposals. It's easy to think Scotland, as a neutral country without a major role on the world stage, would only need a small defence force like Ireland, but add oil and gas rigs far out at sea to the mix and the requirements go up. If the UK parliament's definition of Scottish waters is any indication of what Scotland's territorial waters will be like on independence then it will also have a far larger area to patrol and police than Ireland does.  I remember a few years ago hearing that Salmond supposedly suggested using the Clyde as the site for Scotland's main naval base, which would be stupid since most of the active rigs are on the other side of Scotland.

A better point of comparison is Norway, which has similar defence needs to an independent Scotland: Oil and gas rigs far out at sea, large territorial waters and borders to police and island territories some distance from the mainland. Norway's defence budget is £4.4bn with nearly 25,000 regular and 45,000 reserve members. Its air force has 57 fighter aircraft, 35 helicopters serving various roles and a small number of other aircraft; its navy has 70 ships including 5 heavy frigates, 6 submarines and 14 patrol boats; its army has 52 tanks, 104 IFVs, 390 APCs and 190 IMVs. It also has a rapid mobilisation force (the Home Guard) with further units and equipment.

Noway and its surrounding territorial waters are vast compared to those possible for an independent Scotland, so of course its budget and number of personnel will be higher. Nonetheless I am not sure the numbers you quote would satisfy Scotland's defence needs. For Scotland, it would make sense to have many more reservists than regulars as Norway does, as they are more likely to face transient, random threats rather than ongoing military campaigns as the british military engages in. 5000 reservists is a very small number, assuming this includes reservists in all areas of the defence forces rather than just operational roles (though this arrangement is similar to the Irish Defence Forces, which has nearly 10k regulars and 5k reservists). 12 aircraft is a ridiculously small number, even Ireland has more than that (this would include helicopters and transport aircraft which provide a wide variety of functions outside of combat). Land forces probably wouldn't need to be as well equipped as their Norwegian counterparts, I certainly doubt it needs tanks, but they would need a decent number of APCs. Their job wouldn't be so much to defend against an invading army (not much likelihood of that), but to provide internal security in the event of a terrorist threat or the (very unlikely) possibility of a violent uprising/rioting that is beyond the resources of the police to handle. Again it may also be involved in international peace/security missions, especially if Scotland joins NATO.

I am not an expert in this, just some guy who looked at numbers on wikipedia and drew opinions, but I don't think the proposals you described would satisfy Scotland's defence needs, particularly given the possibility of it joining NATO. There are many small countries with simple defence forces that engage in overseas UN/NATO operations, but I do not know whether there is any obligation to do so, or if there is any benefit in them voluntarily doing so. Thus it may be possible for Scotland to opt out completely from any foreign engagements, though I could see it having a higher standing/influence among the UN countries if it chose to lend resources. I think that 12 aircraft could be just enough to meet routine border policing needs, but would be insufficient to also provide emergency response to attacks on oil/gas infrastructure, large scale border incursions and major disasters, unless there is a separate civil defence/resilience organisation dedicated to natural disaster response. The number of personnel looks sensible enough though I think it would make sense to have far more reservists. I think that £2.5bn is a very optimistic figure for the defence budget and it would probably be a fair bit higher.

Frankly I think the proposals you mentioned were just generated from looking at the Irish Defence Forces and scaling it up to Scotland-sized figures, without accounting for Scotland's higher defence needs (critical oil/gas infrastructure and far larger territorial waters) as well as the possibility of NATO membership rather than pursuit of a staunch neutrality policy like Ireland.",0,1410534008,null,0,false,0,ckgbb6c,t3_2g6tk9,t1_ckgbb6c,t1_ckg91d5,null,1427051668,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Despite his claims not to be against Catholics 'as people', he sometimes had an odd way of showing it. Hearing that an Italian ice-cream parlour had opened on Belfast's Shankill Road, he addressed a local meeting. 'You people of the Shankill Road, what's wrong with you?

I don't have a cat or many dealings with cats, so I have no interesting cat-based anecdotes, although I do have a story from my work sports day yesterday. Following the day's festivities a few of us were having a bit of a kickabout using the bouncy castle (yes there was a bouncy castle at my work sports day and yes it was amazing) as the goal. Following a stint as a wobbly goalie I swapped places with one of the other chaps and had a go at trying to put one past the new goalie. Now I've never been particularly good (or any good at all in fact) at football, so when the ball came to me I thought I'd take my chance to put away a belter right in the top corner. I swung my foot back, shot it forward to score the greatest goal mankind has ever seen, and promptly missed the ball completely, hit the safety mat at the front of the bouncy castle and fall flat on my face, my dreams of premiership stardom destroyed amid howls of laughter from anyone who happened to witness my downfall.

So lets say this is all above board and negotiations are taking place, like mentioned in the thread previously CH and ENIC met to discuss how they could assist with the build of the stadium correct? 

Let's go waaaaay back some decades, the very first investment/business that the Guggenheim family ran was the 'Cain Hoy' stables and they were in the horse racing industry. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cain_Hoy_Stable

So the name Cain Hoy has direct correlation to Guggenheim and seemingly, appear to be a stand alone company set up with the purpose of funding/purchasing our club. On the 11th of this month we set up a relationship with Rothschild in relation to the stadium build. 

http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/new-stadium-development-clarification-110914/

Moreover, as Westminster politicians of all stripes have hastily made clear, if Scotland votes No, the devolved administration will soon get so much clout that the practical difference between staying in the union and leaving it will narrow.

Check out the consumer advice sites, they generally have template letters for you to send off to the lender. Basically, if you choose to do the whole process yourself, it goes like this:

1. Send off a DSAR (data subject access request, sometimes called data subject information request). It costs £10, which your claims company would make you pay. This will take several weeks, but eventually the bank will provide you with all of the information they have on you, including any late payment charges and payment protection premiums. It will also contain the terms of any insurance added to the loan, which you should read carefully to see if you would have been excluded from claiming for any reason, for example due to your age or profession.

2. Send a letter of complaint about your charges, including why you believe they are unlawful, and that you are claiming back everything paid and 8% interest on top of that (this is because you could otherwise have invested that money, and would have been earning interest on that).

3. Then follows a little back-and-forth between you and the lender, and at the end of it they send you a cheque. Most aren't in the position of arguing the toss, and roll over fairly easily.

If the loan is ongoing, your lender may use the amount they pay out to offset part of the loan (and reduce the amount you then have to pay back). This is legal, and isn't anything to worry about.

If you go through a claims company, they will usually charge you at least 25% of the claim amount. This can cause major problems for you if your lender does use it to pay off part of the loan. I remember one customer who claimed several thousand pounds, which was set against the loans, and was then hounded by his claims company for money he didn't have. He ended up having to take out another loan to pay them.

I would also like to say that using a claims company does not speed the process up in any way. The banks still have the same amount of time to respond, and ride those limits pretty close.",0,1410536428,null,0,false,0,ckgchg8,t3_2g3ay4,t1_ckgchg8,t3_2g3ay4,null,1427050914,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

true,Jak-Herer,null,null,"&gt;The prospect of a British exit from the EU would scare investors much more than a possible Scottish exit from Britain

&gt;the Conservatives, who are promising a Euro-referendum if they win next year’s general election

Hence why it makes sense for Scotland to get out the UK before the whole thing goes to pot.

&gt;such as abolishing the “bedroom tax”, a recent measure designed to nudge people out of too-large social housing. To break up a country over such small, recent annoyances would be nuts.

This is not a small issue to the people it effects, many of whom live in Scotland.  This is a tax on the poor, there are no smaller homes for these people to move into.

&gt;the oil is gradually running out. In order to maintain state spending after it is gone, taxes would have to rise.

Whereas if we remain in the UK, Westminster will say ""don't worry boys, we'll cover you for this, no need to raise taxes!""  Aye, right. 

&gt;Foreign investors and big businesses that mostly serve English customers could well move south.

Except of course by this point in the future, it looks very likely that the UK will no longer be a member of the EU.  Foreign investors and big business's will have already abandoned ship.

&gt;It might relent, but only if Scotland agrees to such strict oversight that independence ends up meaning little.

Nonsense.  Independence never means little.  Should we stop fighting for 99 powers because we still won't have 1 or 2?

&gt;This is indeed a danger, but in going independent Scotland would swap the possibility of an EU exit for a certain future as a small, vulnerable country.

In 2011, the Russian navy invaded Scottish waters.  In 2013, the Russian navy invaded Scottish waters.  On both occasions, the UK did nothing in advance of their approach.  

&gt;Its best hope of remaining influential is to stay put, and fight the Eurosceptics.

The UK is no longer truly an influential power in Europe.

&gt;For all its tensions and rivalries, and sometimes because of them, the history of the union shows that the Scots, Welsh, English and Northern Irish are stronger, more tolerant and more imaginative together than they would be apart.

Refer back to England wanting out of the EU and UKIP's rise to power.

true,agentdcf,flair8,,"I haven't followed the Dodgers since I was a kid, but how does the ownership group compare to AEG, the Kings' owners? AEG is mainly interested in property development and management, in particular sports arenas and concert venues. They've found that they need successful teams to get the most out of their property, and thus they tend to put competent people in charge of the teams and leave them alone. It's worked very well for the Kings, who have now won the Stanley Cup twice in three years with homegrown talent, shrewd player acquisitions, and good management overall. It's a welcome change from the incompetence that Kings fans suffered through for decades.

Also, Levy and Dean Lombardi have some real similarities in management strategies, mainly that each seem to have long-term plans that combine acquiring talent with sound financial management.

I commented more on AEG in another post, but I'll reproduce it here:

&gt; AEG or an owner like that would be ideal for Spurs. They've done wonders for the Los Angeles Kings. The real core of their business model is property development and management (they own sports arenas and concert venues all over the world), but they recognized that owning an arena and property in downtown LA was only really useful with the Kings as a successful team; as such, they've learned to put hockey people in charge of hockey and leave them there. The club is in good shape both financially and competitively, and the long-term ownership seems to be stable.

&gt;A company like that would probably love the opportunity to develop a large bloc of property in London, centered around an arena and a winning club. That combination would lead toward a fairly sustainable business model of which Spurs were one component. We likely wouldn't see really large transfer budgets, but they would recognize the importance of a quality product on the pitch for the other parts of their business. As such, they wouldn't see Spurs as a cash cow to simply suck money out of. Instead I'd expect a transfer budget and wage structure that would keep Spurs competitive, and would be in line with the revenues from the new stadium and from selling players from the youth academy. I suppose, then, that it would be more or less like it is now, only with a larger overall revenue stream from a larger stadium and perhaps, down the line, with more merchandise sales and bigger television contracts.

&gt;I would also speculate that they wouldn't jack ticket prices up too high, since a big part of their property development and management strategy is built around getting people into their neighborhoods. They want as many people moving through the area as possible, so their incentive is keep prices reasonable. I don't think we'd see any real bargains, but nor would Spurs ticket prices be out of line with other teams in the area.

&gt;Overall, I think this would be far better than a moneybags owner whose funds are somewhere between dubious and outright corrupt, and whose management will run up huge debts or get us in trouble with financial fair play.",0,1410537068,null,0,false,0,ckgcsyd,t3_2g76ng,t1_ckgcsyd,t1_ckg9do3,null,1427050727,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

We've never had a revolution, and the expectation is that large areas of land are held in perpetuity by the landed gentry. However, I'm not sure what any government would actually do, because any serious action, like a land or mansion tax, risks damaging Scotland's reputation as a destination for capital, which is where Scotland's competitive advantage is, and clearly a major part of the SNP's vision of future competitiveness (see their talk over the last decade about financial deregulation, lowering corporation tax, etc). Like Ireland, Scotland has an English speaking, well educated workforce, and a good location; with attractive taxation rates, it would be a major location for multinational companies to base their operations to sell into the European market. The problem is that this has implications for domestic policy, as you can see with the pressure that comes from London.

It wouldn't. There is no doubt that both Scotland and the rUK are economically viable.

I've always been a city fan because my dad has his whole life but I was never into football, didn't watch games but would enjoy going to the very few I went to when I was young. About 4-5 years ago I started actually enjoying watching football and since I was always said I supported city I chose to fully support them and watch every game and try to go watch as many as I could. Now since this wasn't too long after the takeover and we were starting to make more of a name for myself I got a lot of flak from United fans calling me a glory Hunter. I learned I couldn't give a shit what they think, I knew I supported city my whole life even though I only started watching not long ago. My conclusion is that you shouldn't care what other people think, if you know you chose city for your own reasons then it doesn't matter.

It might seem counter-intuitive but it's safer to have a speed limit which reinforces the limit at which most drivers will drive at, rather than arbitrarily deciding what the best speed is due to some guidebook.

However..... there is a case to be made when you have workers on the road to impose an artificially low limit for safety reasons.

Are you serious? Because there are people working in the frigging road. Hence the roadworks.

I cycle and have just been utterly dismayed during a six month roadwork project near my village how routinely the limits set in place to protect the workers has been flouted. not only that but the workers have also been routinely verbally abused by drivers.

In America, they double the fines. Should do the same here.

I've driven the stretch of road in question too and the reason for the 40 as opposed to 50 is because this is a dual carriageway, not a motorway, so you are funnelled down the one lane and it is EXTREMELY tight.
