A really good medium strength dominican stick.  I havent had a bad Fuente so far and the Queen B is one that I'm currently searching for a box of, just not at the price that CW has them.

**LFD Double Ligero Chiselito, €6.30**

Another stronger stick, tempered by the fact that these stopped being made in 2008, this cigar will be at least 6 years old, maybe 7 and is a smooth, slightly peppery dark smoke.  Even if you buy it now to smoke in a few years it will be worth it.

**L'Atallier LAT46 Selection Special, €9.50**

An outstanding smoke, full of flavour, its a good size (corona gorda) a joy to smoke.

**Joya de Nicaragua Antano 1970 Robusto Grande, €5.20**

A nice cheap smoke but still a very good one, easily a daily smoke.  I found it to be quite sweet and not at all the powerhouse I expected from the look of it.

**Alec Bradley Black Market Robusto, €6.00**

I really like these, chocolate, caramel, and a nice amount of smoke output too.

**Por Larranaga Panetelas, €3.20**

Such a good breakfast smoke, perfect with a good strong coffee.

This whole lot came to €68.15 so just under your budget and gives you 9 really solid cigars to choose from.  One or two of them may be a little strong for you at the moment, but its worth giving them a shot after a good sized meal.",0,1416509464,null,0,false,0,cm86j7l,t3_2mtmkw,t1_cm86j7l,t3_2mtmkw,null,1425926847,1,false,ukcigars,t5_33cs8,1

Truth is, whilst Turing did stellar work, the Bombe they buit at Bletchley was a development of a [Cryptologic Bombe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomba_%28cryptography%29) developed by Polish cryptographers. Turing applied his ideas regarding automated computation to make it much faster and more efficient.

In turn the Americans built a couple of hundred, developing some of them to run much faster than Bletchley's - by the end of the war one version could break the 4-rotor naval Enigma in about 20 minutes and the 3-rotor version could be cracked in 50 seconds.

The Enigma machine was developed as a commercial product in Germany, which the Germans took and developed in some ways (the Naval version had 4 rotors instead of 3, etc). The Polish Secret Service had broken Enigma by the mid-1930s however. When the Germans rolled in to Poland and the Poles fled to Britain, those cryptographers tapped up the British authorities and presented their knowledge to British cryptographers who were all fairly amazed at what their Polish counterparts had been up to for the past decade - they'd thought Enigma was unbreakable and not even bothered trying.

None of that is to talk down Turing. He was a brilliant mathematician and his papers on his Universal Machine laid much of the ground work for general purpose computers. But in the case of Enigma, he was leading a team who were developing and deriving more sophisticated ways of breaking Enigma based on the groundwork done by their Polish counterparts.

**Bill Tutte**

Arguably as important as Turing was a guy called [Bill Tutte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._T._Tutte) who worked on the Lorenz Cipher - which was a 12-rotor system (compared to Enigma's 3 or 4). Armed with just ciphertext and some flaky intelligence that it *might* involve 12 rotors, he reverse engineered the Lorenz machine *having never seen one before*.

It wasn't until near the end of the war that one was actually captured by the allies.

By contrast, the Enigma teams had an ""easy"" job of it - they had captured Enigma machines, and knew how they worked - they just had to crack the task of establishing the key settings so they could decrypt the messages.

It's not an exaggeration when people describe Tutte's work as ""the intellectual feat of the century"" - the man reverse-engineered the working principles of a machine that *noone outside of German High Command had ever seen*, which got them to the stage of then actually attacking the cipher once they understood *how* it was generated and trying to get back to the key settings.",0,1416509657,null,0,false,0,cm86n3b,t3_2mvctk,t1_cm86n3b,t1_cm7z46y,null,1425926797,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

I don't understand why people keep talking about Labour like they need the working class or should be representing them, they ditched the working class with Blair and immediately won a huge electoral landslide, for fucks sake in modern Britain the middle class tend to have more liberal or left wing views than the working class [\[Source\]](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/26/middle-class-leftwing-working-poll). No party has won a general election since 1973 by campaigning on working class issues, except maybe Thatcher promising to toughen up immigration laws in 1979 and the buying of council houses, but still the majority of the campaign was focused on attacking Labour. The working class moved away from Labour just as much as Labour moved away from the working class, which saved the party.

That twitter user is wrong.
Anyone and everyone can afford an education because it is *free* to go to a British university. You *will not pay a penny of tuition up front*.

Once you leave, if you earn more than £15k/yr, a small amount is taken to start repaying your loan. It increases as you earn more.

Some people will soiree out into high paying jobs and get stung for £1000/yr in repayments and be debt free before they're 30. Some people will only land low paying jobs and will never pay off their loan. But they'll also only pay a tenner a month towards it.

You can argue that the cost of tuition does not represent value for money, but you *cannot* argue that it prevents people from poorer backgrounds going to university, because in that respect it costs *exactly the same as it always has* - you need to cover your living costs and that's it. If you get a job afterwards you start repaying. If you don't, you don't.

This stands in stark contrast to the US where a loan for tuition fees is like any other loan and if you start defaulting on payments they'll come after you the same as if you're defaulting on your mortgage.",0,1416513605,null,0,false,0,cm88w1b,t3_2msqo8,t1_cm88w1b,t3_2msqo8,null,1425924323,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Green is the opposite colour to red so they will cancel each other out. The primer won't add any colour to your skin so you won't look like you are wearing makeup. 

Foundation/concealer will work as well but it may require a bit of playing around to get it to look natural, whereas a primer you can just slap it on and if you miss a bit or put it in the wrong place, no one should be able to tell!

The only thing I will mention again is that the KIKO primer definitely does not take away all the redness as it is designed for use under foundation (i.e. what the primer does not remove, the foundation will).
Also after you apply anything to your skin (especially if you are rubbing it on with your hands) it will look even more red for a few minutes but it will then cool down.

What matters is the opinion, and the reasoning behind it. We have literature, science and communication to help us. An opinion based on sound logic, evidence from scientifically rigorous enquiry and careful study should be criticised upon its merits.

Whether you have personal experience is not a disqualification from having an opinion.

Indeed, to suggest that personal experience (or the ability to have personal experience) is a pre-requisite for a valid opinion, is to put subjectivity and emotion ahead of reason and objectivity; precisely the opposite to what is required to have a meaningful debate.",0,1416514316,null,0,false,0,cm89a7m,t3_2mvg06,t1_cm89a7m,t1_cm85et1,null,1425924143,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

false,thejoe,eng-hampshire,Language akin to grunting,"Images with captions like this are annoying because they show a pretty big misunderstanding of how the Parliamentary system works - this is what you vote for, dammit.

Single bills are given a great deal of time and several sessions. First reading is largely a formality, there is a vote here to decide whether it will go ahead or not (it does 90% of the time with just an vocal vote, nothing written). Second begins the formal debate process - this picture is taken from one session of the second reading process, there will be several *days* of debate depending on the significance of the bill.

So, firstly all 650 MPs (minus the abstentionists) cannot fit in the chamber. It is physically too small for them all, so you cannot expect everyone to be there. Secondly, not every MP has to *debate* each and every bill. The only thing that matters is if they turn up to vote. It's not even *possible* for an MP to attend every debate, some of them live in Scotland and that's very far to travel for work every single day and they have *jobs to do at home, too*.

Words spoken in the Chamber are only spoken in order to be written down as a public record of how they think the bill should change, these considerations are taken to the Committees (the actually important bit of the whole process, watch those instead of the main chamber proceedings) to do just that.

Third reading is when the big debate happens and the final vote on whether the bill goes ahead to the Lords.

It seriously *doesn't matter* how many MPs turn up to debate. It seriously doesn't show how much concern or care there is from individual MPs if they don't. In fact it's better when it's only a small number like this, because it means only those who are actually relevant to the debate are there and more views can be heard within the allotted time.

So the classic comparison image of MPs debating the minimum wage and their own is horribly misleading (it's also incorrect since the second image is NOT from an MPs' wage debate) since both are taken at completely different stages of the process - and the second one isn't even a debate, it is a vote.

If you're affected by images like this, please do take the time to contact your MP to arrange a day visit to Parliament so you can see how it all works with your own eyes.

Which won them no general elections for 20 years, bottom line for the Labour party is electoral victory, courting the working class vote didn't give them that, courting the middle class vote did. 

The Labour party doesn't hate the working class, it just correctly doesn't consider them necessary in the mission of getting a majority in the House of Commons, it might be kind of harsh, but it's how electoral politics works. Courting the working class won't win you a general election, which is what the Labour party needs to do.  

That and, like I said, the Labour parties long term principles on social justice, pro-immigration, multiculturalism don't gel with the majority of working class opinion in the country. Labour shouldn't drop those to hope to gain votes from a voting base that won't help them win the election. Tbh, these principles were the reason for the break with the working class voter, Labour during the 1970s steadfastly refused to compromise over things like the death penalty, the legalisation of homosexuality, not agreeing with Enoch Powell, which all were deeply unpopular with the Working Class.

Anyhow, I think that's a fair point about buying for positions we don't need, and one I hadn't immediately thought of. It is curious to buy someone known for playing LCB for a sum much higher than an LCB you bought the summer previous (and who was far more highly rated). I think that's down to Lovren being a right footer who can easily play RCB, though. But we'll see if he plays Sakho and Lovren together. So far he hasn't.

I think you're right that there does seem to be a disjointed aspect to the side at the moment, but I'm not sure it's any different than a lot of clubs. That alone isn't relevant, but maybe buying players like Aspas, Alberto, etc. and determining quickly they aren't good enough and loaning/selling them for peanuts is the new standard? I think a lot of clubs do it, so we aren't unique. I think it speaks to the weakness of BR, though, that he demanded to have complete control over things yet seems to act in ways that indicate he could use more help.

Also, I'm curious who you see in terms of some good examples of guys who aren't world-class players but are better than players who are good for their clubs in the league? The tier thing was definitely just a theory of mine, but I can't see great examples of players who are substantially better than Remy yet substantially worse than someone like Reus.",0,1416517041,null,0,1416517563,0,cm8atiz,t3_2mveir,t1_cm8atiz,t1_cm84arz,null,1425923255,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

 Apparently the course of events involves them getting up, her going to the shops, them having sex and then being 'half asleep' when starting to have sex again (the incident). she then gave him a lift to the train station.  and there are questions about how 'half asleep' somebody could have been in the timeframe. Though this is still ambiguous enough to get him extradited given that both women have recounted their accusations and would be hostile witnesses to the prosecution (if they allow witnesses in this kind of thing in Sweden) on both the deliberately breaking a condom and the 'half asleep' cases I find it hard to understand how he would be convicted if everything was equal. 

It kind of seems like either a mix up or ham fisted handling of this by the police lead him and others to believe that he was in danger or they were really going after him. I'm not sure about the Sweden being unable to extradite him bit either. I've read so much stuff about it all I feel like I don't know anything.

I've met polish people I've technically been in competition with. We got along great.

I know it's anecdotal. I know four people don't represent all of a populace. But still.

1) If planning was done before FTTC (which is fibre for infinity) was in full-swing, then Openreach would have just gone in and done the copper cable per whatever agreement was made in the early days. (Build finished around 2011)

2) The rest of your area already has fibre before the new build was done, and Openreach didn't see it commerically viable to go in and start messing around with the fibre in their duct (unlikely, but depends how big the build is). You can try and [spot one of these DSLAMs](http://i.imgur.com/ebWle17.jpg) in the streets immediately near you to check if this is the case.

3) The exchange that serves your building isn't enabled for fibre yet (unlikely, but possible. There are a number of exchanges in London that are still to be enabled - Canada Water &amp; Rotherhite immediately spring to mind)

4) There is no fibre in your immediate area, yet. However, as it's now a new build it'll be a fight with the property management company as they'll not be too bothered about trying to get Openreach to do it as they've already got their cashflow guaranteed.

5) There is aready Virgin Media in the rest of the area, however Virgin had a period where they weren't laying fibre, even for new-builds (post-2008 recession), so Openreach won't bother just yet, because anybody that wants fast internet already has it through Virgin.

This happened to a new build I was renting, St James actually took Virgin Media to court as they took the 'surveying' fee and then refused to lay the fibre, no idea who won)

6) You live in the middle of nowhere... In which case it's down to the government BDUK programme and how your local council wants to use their allocation.

I've had painful experiences with broadband, and it's something I always check when I go to view a rental property. I turned down a place because the speedtest download speed had it at 0.5Mb with no possibility to get fibre for at least a few years (the management company published their AGMs where residents continually requested it for **years**)

Basically, property developers want their latest new builds to have it (or even fibre optic all the way to the premises (FTTP - up to 300Mb with Openreach or 1GB with Hyperoptic), so they can sell their houses and flats quickly and for a premium. Any developments they have already made their money on, nah, ain't nobody got time for that, down to the Property Management company now.

Important thing to note, it's not down to TalkTalk, Sky or even BT where the fibre ends up, but instead Openreach, which serves the aforementioned. So changing provider isn't generally going to solve a problem if your area isn't enabled. 

Best thing to do is to drum up interest by telling your ISP that you want it (you can do this on their websites). For greater success, get your neighbours to do it too. Your ISP can then provide statistics to Openreach who handle all the planning and make a decision on whether it's commercially viable - I think Openreach require a payback of around 10-15 years, although I have no sources on that and it's likely a figure that's been thrown around over the past few years.

Contacting Openreach directly probably wouldn't work as I'm almost certain they don't deal directly with end-users, but only ISPs.

Sounds like a lot when I type it all out tho!!

I have inactive atopic eczema and mild papulopustular rosacea, however I am not prone to clogging or breakouts generally. I really like the NSPA night cream and consider that suitable for under make up, it's thick but not greasy. The Boots night cream is OK but not sure it would work so well for under make up: there are tester pots of the whole line in Boots.

I used the daytime version of that Eucerin cream many years ago and really liked it - not clogging, light yet hydrating, helped the eczema around my eyes IIRC. I had a sample of the PC barrier repair and it was very light, nice but not wowed by it considering the price.

Every pass is followed by a forward run from the player who just passed the ball which helps create space further up the pitch.

Now a days the confidence just isn't there.  Passing combinations in the midfield area are much more likely to be interrupted by a backpass all the way our back line which stunts our attack and gives the other team's defense a chance to reset.  We still have plenty of possession, and BR will often say after the game that ""we had control"" but many times it's our CB's who are getting many of the touches while we're in control of the game.

That sort of possession is pretty useless.  Granted I'd rather play the ball back rather than give up possession, but now it's what we do by default. And when your CB's are getting that many touches you're also taking a lot of risk because if they make a mistake in possession it will often lead to a goal.  The ball isn't going into the areas of the pitch where the other defense really comes under pressure.  Instead we're keeping the ball in parts of the pitch where a slip or mistake or lapse in concentration will lead to goal for the other team rather than for us.

That's the *point* of the rule of law. To judge rationally and fairly in  matters where people are very likely very emotional. Murder gets people pretty emotional, and commonly the reaction is to revenge-murder *any* likely suspect, rather than to carefully look at the evidence to ensure you get the *actual* murderer. The rule of law is there to make sure justice is *actually* done, to the right people, in a fair and measured fashion. The emotional reaction is often very much at odds with that.

I imagine she does understand that the threat of ISIS and terror attacks is something that gets people worried - but thinks that abandoning our principles, resorting to emotional rather than rational reactions, and ditching the rule of law at the first sign of difficulty is *not the way to go*.

However most of this isn't a technical issue, it's a ""brand"" issue, ResNet has a fluffy ""pretty"" web interface to guide you though, advertising features and things students need to know. Campus wired (driven directly by PASS) is very utilitarian, straight to the point.

The more I think about it removing the distinction would be advantageous from a configuration/complexity perspective, however that'll require the beautification of PASS to occur, something which is certainly a good year away.

For now they are effectively two completely separate networks which are not permitted to talk to each other, i.e. spare ports in a lab or seminar room can't talk to ResNet.

On the one hand, it helps teachers to avoid feeling like they have to teach to the test all the time allowing them to focus on key skills and really teaching. In recent years the idea of continuous assessment has got a bit silly, it's become routine for students to sit exams up to four times and just take the best mark. On the other hand, I think the all or nothing final exam approach puts tremendous pressure on students and is setting some of them up for failure. Sadly, any kind of one size fits all national system will always disadvantage some individuals, striking the balance is incredibly difficult.

Specifically in English Literature, there were also proposals to alter the national curriculum to focus more on dead white English men, which were received about as well as you'd imagine. The idea went something along the lines of promoting British values (there's currently a lot of American Lit in the standard line up), to which the counter argument was that they aren't our values any more. Personally I'd like to see a bit less of an American influence in the English Literature curriculum in this country, but in favour of other anglophone literature. In particular, I think Britain has reached a point in our development where we need to start openly discussing the unsavoury aspects of our history, and I think post-colonial literature would be a good way of introducing that.

I think teachers should be allowed to teach what they want, as long as it brings knowledge to the children, and develops them as a person.

And a clarification, when you say ""English Literature"" do you mean the nationality or the language?

&gt;Personally I'd like to see a bit less of an American influence in the English Literature curriculum in this country, but in favour of other anglophone literature.

I'm going to have to respectfully disagree. I think that literature from other countries opens our minds. I actually wish we had Tolkien in our system, or even something more historical like Canterbury tales. Shakespeare? There a lot of great American classics, and while I don't think they should swamp your literature courses, I think exposing learners to other cultures is beneficial. The Great Gatsby for instance. I can't imagine that not being in my curriculum growing up. The Good Earth is another fantastic novel that has stuck with me. These bring elements of other cultures that open constructive lanes of dialogue. Then again, this is just my opinion, and I'm not really entitled to see how your education should change as I haven't been raised in it. 

&gt;In particular, I think Britain has reached a point in our development where we need to start openly discussing the unsavory aspects of our history, and I think post-colonial literature would be a good way of introducing that.

I can agree with that. Reflection on the past is very important. I know we like to sweep a lot of shit under the rug (especially in recent history), and that's really a hell of an understatement. Civil war literature is very interesting, and I always feel like the best way to learn about the past is through that period's literature.

Nope. Messi had growth hormone deficiency. When a person is growing up, HGH (human growth hormone) and many other hormones and chemicals naturally released in your body help to direct and coordinate growth and development. A deficit in these hormones would mean short stature, future endocrine problems, and a potential life-long list of chronic conditions. FCB paid for his treatment when he was a kid so he could have a (close to) normal development. 

&gt;and fixed it by medication

Yea, because what was wrong was a deficit in a hormone. I have not seen any indication that Sturridge's issue is because of a decreased endocrine function. He seems to have a textbook example of what we in the medical field call *footballis glassius*, an unfortunately condition shared by such famous players as Aguero. Unfortunately, no pill is going to fix this. ",0,1416525780,null,0,false,0,cm8fm46,t3_2mx7m6,t1_cm8fm46,t1_cm8es71,null,1425920882,10,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,10

Here in Birmingham it's a case of 'deal with it or go out of your way to find a non-Halal source'. 

The nearest meat to me is the local corner ships - which happen to all be Muslim run. The butchers only stocks Halal meat and in addition to it being Halal slaughtered they have a sign advertising that it's done in the *traditional* way and not using any kind of stunning / sedative / way of calming the animal before its throat is cut. 
 
I refuse to shop there. 

I appreciate that all the meat we eat has to come from somewhere and it involves the killing of animals. I'm OK with that - or I'd be a vegetarian. But the animal should suffer the least amount possible - I don't care if it costs me more - I do not want that animal to die suffering for me. I want it quick and pain free.

The thing is, at the moment American Lit makes up as much as, and sometimes over, half the English Literature curriculum in the UK. British literature makes up most of the rest, with maybe a tiny bit of poetry from the rest of the world.

Sweet, just wanted to know.

I totally agree with you. Half of it being American literature is very unnecessary. As I said, I don't want it swamped with our stuff, and that is most definitely swamped of a higher magnitude.

Identity is complicated, especially in America. I obviously have no input on what goes in and out of your society, except perhaps in the goods I buy from you. Preservation of culture is also a bit odd. I think change is usually progressive, but marring a culture to the point of beyond recognition is hardly a good thing. Centuries of culture is a wealth of wisdom to pull from, and I really hope we, as in the entire human race, can continue to pull from it.

For acne prone skin thick creams/ hot cloth cleansers are perhaps not the best, they are a little harder to remove fully, and some can break out from fatty alcohols. Out of melting gel or oil cleanser I would say it's mostly personal taste, they both leave clean skin with a cloth and warm water.

You might find the melting gel a bit more 'normal' coming from using a foaming style cleanser although melting gels (and oils) are applied to dry skin. I certainly found an oil strange to apply at first - if you are curious head to The Body Shop for a free sample as I did!

I don't think the NSPA brand is the best fit with bargain basement Asda so I know what you are saying! That line is better than any Boots own brand skincare I have tried and many high street branded products.

Once you are past 25 (I think that's the age the funding cuts off) or have been to University (perhaps you weren't able to acutely gauge the future labour market at the age of 17 and made a bad degree choice) then you are pretty screwed.

Training and education are horrendously expensive and when unemployed or underemployed you are least able to afford it.

At the moment we don't have a truly agile workforce - we just have an exploitable one for menial labour. This is damaging both economically (as workers lack the skills the market desires) and socially (as it creates great resentment and anger).

Simply telling people to 'improve themselves' as if they haven't thought of that already is extremely patronising and only serves to enrage people and drive us further from pragmatic solutions.

They were probably only half a kilo each, but a relentless and concentrated attack (along with dust/dirt/stones in the eyes) made it hard to stand your ground.  Fortunately fields are large, so there's lots of ammo and space to dodge, but when you find an area that has just the right soil it's worth defending.  It was good practice for cricket (long hard accurate throws and comparable weight), and for working out violence (lots of small cuts from the flint).  A good trick was to throw a high lob to distract, then rush in and pitch one at the face.

""Anglicans generally and officially believe in the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist, but the specifics of that belief range from transubstantiation, sometimes with Eucharistic adoration (mainly Anglo-Catholics), to something akin to a belief in a ""pneumatic"" presence, which may or may not be tied to the Eucharistic elements themselves (almost always ""Low Church"" or Evangelical Anglicans). The normal range of Anglican belief ranges from Objective Reality to Pious Silence, depending on the individual Anglican's theology.

false,The_Disco_Spider_,null,null,"I don't think I've ever agreed with a post so much*. You've pretty much covered all my thoughts about what's going on.

I feel a lot of people are blowing things out of proportion and not really understanding football with too much depth.

**Our form**

Hasn't been great but really we're sandwiched between Everton and Tottenham right now (4th place rivals) and are just 4 point off 4th. Last season 22W/7D/9L would still have gotten you 4th place.

**Our formation/lineup**

Multiple people regularly complaining that we're not playing 4-4-2 diamon,  but really how do you justify dropping Sterling (*""he's been our only attacking threat this season""*) or Coutinho (*""we need someone who can actually do something in the final 3rd""*) or giving Lallana (*""£25m for the bench, c'mon Rodgers""*) even less time on the pitch to accommodate Borini or Lambert? People will keep pointing out what's wrong with the lineups but not see what's stopping us fixing it. 4-3-3 can get Lallana, Sterling and Coutinho on the pitch at the same time whilst having the possibility of going 2 up top from the bench for more impact.

**Our transfer business**

More of the same with people seemingly not understanding football all too well, and maybe a little case  I the grad is always greener. I've seen people suggest we sell Balotelli, Borini and Lambert and buy some combination of Son/Volland/Lacazette/Firmino/Doumbia and add Origi in January like its that simple and inexpensive or that tons more squad changes at the top end of the field would help us click. Also people throwing around names like Benzema/Jovetic/Dzeko like we could get them and not understanding why not or Vargas/Ings because they work hard and offer a lot if movement like they haven't just just descried Borini who they're not keen on.

**Picking on Balotelli**

Not sure that's really the right term but it's clear to see there's some sort of blame game. Complaints that Balotelli doesn't fit out system then suggesting the fix for that would be getting Huntelaar. Complains we should have payed £9m extra for Bony (who isn't too disimilar to Balotelli and would be missing for the Afcon) risked buying the same Remy who missed more games through injury than Sturridge since he joined in January 2013. People are also quick to mention that Balotelli never really had a good scoring record because he scored so many set-pieces, I suppose that makes Gerrard well and truly useless because he can't defend and his last 16 goals have been set-pieces.

____


I know I said ""people"" a lot, but whilst it's only ever a few comments it's still enough to start a small but noticeable trend.

I don't know if our current form and position is bringing out more negative commenters and encouraging them to pipe up or if it's just negatively effecting the regulars but it's getting to the point of ridiculousness. Balotelli vs Tottenham has gone from ""he had a good hour on his first game back since the World Cup"" to ""he missed 3 easy chances that match"" and it's the change from ""a bad penalty/free-kick call vs West Brom and a Jagielka fluke away from two clean sheets and few more points"" to ""we should probably be on even less points, because we're getting lucky"" is astounding.

Rant over.

I don't blame Balotelli for being what he is, but I also don't expect him to score more than 10 open play goals for us in the league this year simply because he never has in the past, therefore I'm not upset he's not scoring or contributing much because I didn't expect him to.  If I end up being wrong, then great as hopefully it means the club is gaining points, but at this point I don't see anything that suggests the evaluation that he's pretty average is not correct.

In this case, without more detail, I can only guess that throughout, there had been no objective findings to indicate this was an actual emergency needing immediate intervention. Everybody gets all sorts of aches, pains, sniffles and headaches which are annoying and uncomfortable, but nevertheless, are not emergencies. 85% of what I see in emergency are minor ailments and illness that needs a good GP, not A:E to help.There is only so much space in any emergency department, thus if the doctors have no free exam space with which to see you in, it is not fair to blame this on doctors or nurses. I do not control the executive policy on building on extensions or not, to increase capacity. And even if there were an infinite number of exam spaces in the emergency department, there are still a finite number of inpatient hospital beds to shift people to once we deal with the emergency bit.What you insultingly call milling around, I call looking or waiting for an exam space for my next patient, waiting for my patient in general to get out of the loo I helped them to, or waiting for the arrival of a patient an ambulance crew has flagged as being a real emergency prior to arrival or decompressing prior to going home as I as usual finished two or three hours ago and tying up loose ends from the patients I attended during the time I was being paid for. Of course I could have just left, but I deeply care about my patients and their outcomes and fight tooth and nail to make sure that at least my patients get the best the NHS has to offer.Emergency departments are not health spas, we are not the local chemist, not the GP surgery, and are not there as an elderly respite care service that relatives can use at a whim so that they can use all of the money they save not paying for a care home, nursing home, or carers for grandma and grandpa to go on a holiday to Tenerife.Expectations always increase, but what does not increase much is our individual share in NI we pay, and as most people I see in A:E are on benefits and or unemployed, the service provided vs. what is paid for is good.We are also not the friendly local drug dealer where you can get your next fix free on the taxpayer.Yet, whilst you wait in the que, the above invariably is what is being dealt with.I am a gentle and kind fellow, but if there is an emergency case needing attention that has arrived whilst I am attending to you, and you have come in with a problem that is not an emergency, unhappily the tone and focus of this consultation will change.I hate that anybody should wait for more than 30 minutes but fundamentally, this is a systemic issue to do with funding, with service closures, with reduction of bed capacity, with lack of weekend and out of hours GP service and not the nurse or doctor in emergency trapped in this system and with no say or control in it.I am really sorry you felt things were not good, bit I kindly ask you to consider the bigger picture and context.",0,1416543933,null,0,false,0,cm8okdo,t3_2mu7va,t1_cm8okdo,t3_2mu7va,null,1425916513,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

What is public has been mostly made public by the Assange team. So we only have what the defence wants us to have. It's *always* going to sound very one-sided if you look into what is publicly known right now.

The things you list should indeed be addressed - in court. The police will already have asked all those questions, and to continue the investigation, they must have got answers which satisfy them.

There haven't been too many  mistakes by the police. Assange keeps saying that there have, and then comparing the process to the English or American process. If you do that, then yeah, it looks like a right cock up from start to finish. But when you understand that Sweden do things *completely differently*, that helps a lot.

He definitely cannot be extradited for espionage or leaking. Sweden doesn't consider leaking to be a crime at all and they don't extradite for espionage, ever - and have [refused to return a traitor to the USA in the past](http://www.wikiwatch.org.uk/4corners/#USallegations).

I have also read a lot. But if you read the myths and the misconceptions, it really helps sort out the bad stuff from the good stuff. And after a while, you will notice that pretty much *everything* that Assange says is not true at all. Those links for you:

Likewise, the many comments on the internet talking about how people that even consider voting for them are bigoted racist idiots have completely backfired.

Bear in mind I do not support UKIP, I'm just trying to report the situation as I see it. 

There has been a lot of immigration into the UK in the last 15 years, albeit not as much as people think, but since immigration tends to focus on certain areas, the people in those areas have some concerns about the place they live changing so quickly. The same thing happens in areas that experience extreme gentrification, and the people that have lived there their whole lives are also often upset, but we don't call those people bigoted against rich people.

Anyway, people have an issue with immigration. Whether they're racist or not, whether the issues are imagined, blown out of proportion, or whatever, the least that Labour could do is ADDRESS THE FUCKING ISSUE. Likewise, people on the internet, address the issue!

A certain percentage of people are always going to be racist. Let's say 5-10%. You can call them racist, and ignore their opinions. But right now we have far more than that considering voting for UKIP, because they are addressing the issue, and no one else is. 

Ed Miliband, if he had any balls, would come out and say ""Look, the reason we're letting so many immigrants in, is because we have so many fucking old people to pay for that you guys would be paying 75% tax to take care of someone else's Grandma."" Suddenly immigration doesn't seem like such a bad idea.

Or maybe that's not the reason we need immigration on this scale. But answer the fucking question.

Do we need immigrants? Yes or no? If yes, why? It can't be that fucking hard to answer that question and convince people, instead of just calling them swivel-eyed loons and fruitcakes and bigots and racists and fascists.

Because that tactic has done NOTHING to combat UKIP. And it's about time that people woke up to that.",0,1416557313,null,0,false,0,cm8sy1x,t3_2mybgj,t1_cm8sy1x,t3_2mybgj,null,1425914398,55,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,55

Of course, if people were smart and voted ""yes"" to AV, it would be much more likely that a party you are happy with would actually get voted in. But we're stuck with the same old system that only works if you have two parties.

EDIT: Strictly speaking, AV would only mean that your MP is more likely to be one you voted for, and it only guarantees that each MP has to win by an absolute majority. The party in power is decides by who gets the most seats in the houses of parliament, which is not something we directly vote for, but is a result of who is voted for by us.

Personally, I think the whole idea of political parties should be abolished, and each candidate should stand independent and on their own merits. We don't *need* a prime minister. All we *need* is the house of commons. Military, economic, etc decisions would be put forward and voted on, rather than decided by an individual who has to toe the party line.

I think by leaving the EU, this problem wouldn't be solved. We all know the primary party opposing the EU is UKIP, but IIRC, they want to promote more open borders with commonwealth countries.

Assuming I'm correct, this would probably be even more harmful. At least the EU is mutual with its borders, and offers economic incentives. With commonwealth countries, there isn't that benefit.

You approached the roundabout in the far right lane - so by my logic you would have either been going right (as indicated by the road markings) or straight over *staying in the right hand lane*. 

Your track looks to have gone over the roundabout in the right hand lane (correct so far) and then moving over to the middle lane - which this geezer was in both on the approach and when leaving - on your exit off the roundabout.

As it happens we've got UKIP, the Conservatives trying to become UKIP-lite, and Labour floundering around in the middle trying to appeal to working class voters but not really obviously standing for anything different.

I really believe there's a massive opportunity for Labour and other traditional left-wing parties to stand up now and provide a proper alternative to the Tories because people are so disillusioned with the way things are going, but nobody (except arguably the Greens) have actually stepped up and stood for something instead of trying to pander to voters and be everything to everyone.

Definitely. It's fear and hatred of the unknown, a tendency for people to blame 'others' for their problems. It's the same with homophobia. I know people who have been staunchly homophobic (for no real reason other than their parents were) who have had their opinions drastically changed because they've become friends with gay people. These people actually cheered when equal marriage came in a while ago. Of course homophobia is a little different in this instance as it's not as big a factor on the economy, but you get my point.

I like to think (and maybe this is for my own sanity more than anything) that if you remove this 'othering' and actually educate and show people why their racism/xenophobia/homophobia is problematic, people are quite reasonable.

Buying Balotelli made Lambert redundant. **Moreno** and **Manquillo** are clear upgrades on existing fullback options. **Can** offers the midfield physicality Allen lacks - people used to suggest we get Mo Diame, Can is definitely going to be better. **Lovren** was, in theory, a well-rounded CB who would provide leadership. **Lallana** and **Markovic** offer more attacking midfield options, necessary given our lack of depth there and Rodgers' desire to play one up top. Lallana's pressing is also excellent.

The funny thing is that people take the piss when you find place names in Australia like [Sandy Beach](http://www.whereis.com/nsw/sandy-beach-2456) and [South West Rocks](http://www.whereis.com/nsw/south-west-rocks-2431). We also have Aboriginal place names like [Mittagong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mittagong#Etymology).  The name translates to ""Little Mountain"".

The names of British places are also derived from things that happened in those places and local geological features. It's just that the origins of the words get lost over time and you end up with a unique name for a place.

The funny part happens when you then transfer these place names to other countries, and the local geography no longer applies.

e.g. [Exeter, UK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exeter) - name is based on the River Exe

We could start with the number of immigrants which the public percieve when asked about three times what it actually is. Is the issue there that there are too many or that there just seem to be too many because of media portrayal of the issue? Should we ask follow up questions like 'WHY do you think you overestimated the amount of immigration' and see if the media is at fault or if its just people noticing the Polish shops or counting the non-white faces and thinking 'immigrants...'?

Or do we start with the benefit tourism issue. We know that you can't just roll in off the boat and be given a house and full benefits but a lot of people think you can. Do we address that issue by educating the public how their own country works or is there a better way? While we're touching on housing there are real problems with people finding somewhere to live. Do we make a law that immigrants can't own houses in the UK or do we address the fact that wealthy pension age people and property firms are buying up the property to let it out and make serious cash off the property market, pricing out first time buyers?

Or the fact that people can't find good worthwhile work due to the effects of a recent recession and opportunistic exploitative capitalism from big companies. Should we make a law that a firm can only hire a certain amount of immigrants? Would that be addressing the issue? Or do we accept that there aren't enough jobs to go around and stop demonising people on benefits? Provide a minimum basic income? Force companies to pay their lowest paid employees better and their CEOs less?

Maybe health is the issue. Maybe we should turn the immigrants away at A and E - theyve not paid  for it - or just fund the NHS better? Take steps to make the country healthier and less reliant on the health service?

See nobody is saying that the problems people face in this country aren't serious because they are.

Consider that half the population are less capable of understanding several points you've made. The fact you can identify these issues and their resolutions proves the point. 

The question you've asked is how do you communicate socioeconomic benefits of immigration that affect the population as a whole, when the position of the guy in the street is, ""my mate seen this gypsie girl who kept beggin' for money and lost his job to a polish guy.""

Statistically, immigration does benefit the entire country; but you can't convince the man on the street because he doesn't see the benefit of it. He doesn't see the tax the ethnic-shop pays, or the people it employs via the trade routes that stock the store. He just sees a ""non white, coming over here and setting up a shop _I_ didn't want.""

Healthcare, education, benefits, emergency services - we've all had some direct interaction with at some point in our lives. We can value those services and I'd wager most of us are happy to pay tax to preserve and support these institutions. The only direct interaction we've had with immigration is the non-English speaking guy who's just trying to sell you some stuff and make a living in a foreign country. 

Consider this.

* Healthcare - you think A&amp;E, intensive care, pallative care, old peoples homes
* Education - you think teachers, primary schools, secondary schools
* Benefits - you think JSA, DLA, housing, childcare, pension
* Emergency services - you think ambulances, fire engines, people who save lives

So when I say ""immigration"" - what do you think of..? I'd say for those who want ""foreigners out"", their daily interaction with immigration is not as positive as the services outlined above.

That's the rub - immigration is a personal issue.

The statistics which argue in favour of immigration cannot change a personal viewpoint.

In addition to the benefits I mentioned, the huge queues at the junctions for Horfield and Filton would probably disappear as traffic was funneled into them at a manageable rate. It could have little impact on the journey times for commuters within Bristol at rush hour.

You have to take penalties out of the equation when looking at players you are bringing in.  It's not a simple ""total goals for 13/14 - Suarez - Sturridge + Balotelli = goal difference to the team"", because Balotelli doesn't take penalties for us.  Even if he did he wouldn't score a dramatic amount more than Gerrard does now.  In Suarez and Sturridge we have lost 2 players that regularly won penalties and replaced them* with someone that regularly scores penalties (which we already have).

There is a similar issue with Origi.  The most recent Anfield Wrap podcast spoke briefly about Origi (getting him in Jan etc etc) and said that he has been ""putting the ball in the net regularly"" - or words to that effect.  To assume he will come to LFC and help out with those goals is a flawed assumption.  He's scored 4 in all competitions for Lille so far this season and 2 have been penalties.  Take out his penalties and Origi has the same amount of goals in all comps for Lille as Balotelli has for us.  I'm excited to see Origi play for us and hope we can get him in January, but I do hope he isn't weighed down by expectation too early (as Balotelli has been!).

The continentals have ceded control over their economy to the ECB and their borders to the EU. Their parliaments are debating an increasingly smaller pool of things they have the means to change. As we saw in Greece and Italy, a change in government means very little when the EU/ECB wields the power. The politicians elected don't actually mind this cosy arrangement, it suits them very nicely. They are simultaneously in power, but not really in power. They can pretend to represent their nation states on the world stage, they can claim expenses and feel important, but when it comes to accountability they can shake their head and say ""it's the EU, can't do anything about it"". So they get all the advantages of being perceived to be in power, but none of the disadvantages like accountability to their electorate, as they know their ""rival"" parties would be in the same position.

I don't think this is the case, if those junctions have to pass 5000 cars an hour (or whatever arbitrary number) there will still be as many cars passing. The fact that they arrive at 40mph rather than 60mph seems unlikely to make any difference to the average speed through the junction, which would be limited by congestion/capacity

&gt;Why should it be tied to a bus project? Maybe it's the only way they think they can get it through. Maybe someone keeps pushing for it but no one will listen unless it's part of something a lot of people have agreed to. If people agree to Metrobus but not the speed limit, one or both will be rejected. That seems to be the way these things work.

This now becomes more of a question of how democracy should run. The idea of tying an unpopular motion to a popular motion to get it through despite popular opinion strikes me as very undemocratic.

If a plan/idea can't stand on it's own merits, and will not get passed, then it is a bad plan/idea, and shouldn't be tagged on to something else in my opinion.

On the other hand, both Conservatives and UKIP spent an unexpected fortune fighting in a seat neither of them were expecting to be a contest. The Tories in particular consistently out spend Labour, so any draining of their coffers is a good thing.

This was dressed up as a two horse race- I bet a lot of Labour voters tactically switched to either the Tories (""keep out the loonies!"") Or UKIP (""give Cameron a body nose!""). Which bodes relatively well for Labour's prospects in key marginals next year. I'd also expect Greens to poll higher in a by election than in the generals- with Labour being a key beneficiary of where those voters end up.

And of course this is a disaster for Cameron. Losing safe seats to a third party is very bad. And this might encourage other defectors anywhere where a eurosceptic MP thinks it might improve his chances (which could be a lot of places).

What's clear is that there is a disconnect between what one group of people want and what another want. You think the argument over immigration is something to be ""won"", like an argument about the reasons for the American civil war or the Great Schism. In order to support your argument, you provide ""sources"", namely studies that show that immigration has improved our GDP. OK, that's fair enough. Now you come up against someone who is against immigration, and when he wants to put forward his side all he has to say is ""my area has changed for the worse, it's harder to find work, housing costs are too high"". Suspicion is automatically cast on his points, and indirectly his character, because he hasn't provided you with quantitative data. Academically educated people always favour quantitative data over qualitative, but nevertheless you take him on on his points because you sympathise with his view. You provide a reputable source that says actually, unemployment has been falling for the last 36 months. You point him to government figures that say house building is up 20%. Because you have hard numbers at your disposal, you walk away thinking you have won the argument. But there is much, much more to this argument than GDP figures and other metrics. How do you put a value on things community cohesion? The really tragic thing is, because this can't be *measured* and quantified, it's dismissed in the national debate. Politicians don't like it - why? Because they can't point to a ""14% increase in community cohesion"" across the despatch box during PMQs.

The same people that shred their expense reports think that its ok to have blanket surveillance of all internet traffic without any judicial review.
The same people that argue that secrecy is *necessary* for national security argue that I have no right to secrets of my own.

The whole invention of laws to protect their behaviour is just cowardice; it its necessary to stop a terrorist attack by illegally tapping a phone or someone's internet then a decent servant would do it and say ""it was illegal but I saved lives"". This would be shown in public and we could say ""ok maybe there should be a faster mechanism for judiciary review"" e.g. a judge could give you legal powers in ten minutes or retrospectively. This law could then be approved and none of the technology they use would have to be considered secret because we'd know what they can do and understand the reviews that are in place. Sure, its not perfect, but its better than allowing blanket surveillance by several orders of magnitude.   

The real issue is this though; anyone that works with data sets will tell you that false positive occur, even with the best tests. When you're talking about a factor as small as ""being a terrorist"", which is less than a fraction of a percent of the population, you could have a test that is 99% accurate at predicting terrorists from internet activity and you'd still be investigating the wrong people most of the time.

It is all too easy these days to mutter that you can't get a job because of that Polish bloke, or whatever. But the fact of the matter is that opportunities for many people, unless they are well-off, well-educated and / or well-skilled, are few and far between. Our tribalism makes us blame the targets we see on an everyday level, not the underlying causes. We live for the present, rarely looking to the past. So our base mistrust of people not from our land, culture or ethnicity spills out and is manifest in prejudice and racism, ranging from the very subtle and insidious to the downright nasty.

You're absolutely right about UKIP's appeal to the unhappy workers, and UKIP are definitely taking advantage of the immediate concerns that they have. But if there were better / more job opportunities, more housing etc. then those concerns would be less valid, and may even cease to exist (though this is unlikely). UKIP would no longer be relevant in British politics. UKIP's appeal is based on a similar disgruntlement that led to the various minority political groups that sprang up in the 1920s and 1930s, the blackshirts, greenshirts, etc.

I didn't like this article either. Owen Jones is pretty hit and miss for me. I agree that UKIP members are not necessarily racist, though there are some racists in the party. I agree that racism appears to be on the rise in Britain, though I would argue that it's only the manner of its expression that has changed in recent years. But I don't like Jones' assertion that ""ukipisation"" is to blame - to me he has fallen into that very same trap, which is a shame because I liked much of his book *Chav*, but here he's looking at the symptoms, and pretending that they are the same as the cause, when clearly (to me, at any rate) the two are very different.

TL;DR Generally agree with you, but I think we need to delve a little deeper into the reasons *why*.

The horrible truth is that the UK government has been completely, absolutely, and totally corrupt for at least 400 years now. Democracy, by its very nature, breeds corruption. 

I will refer you to a quote from 1887, written by Lord Acton(John Emerich Edward Dalberg Acton, first Baron Acton (1834–1902);

&gt; ""Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men.""

This is, and has always been completely true. At the end of the day we are *still* being ruled over by an elite class, the same as we were over 500 years ago. 

There is very little anyone can do about it, as society functions on the idea of voting in leaders to speak up for us and represent us. The minute any group of people get elected by their peers, they close ranks, and become corrupt. Such is human nature. 

It doesnt matter who we elect, the corruption *will* continue. The only way to temporarily put a stop to it is to start a war, believe it or not. As long as the wars are being fought, the politicians are too distracted with stopping their own people being killed or maimed to actually act in a corrupt manner.

You're putting in a lot of guilt by association, don't you think?? 
I'd say it's difficult to truly judge anything when it's like this - the noisy ones are the arseholes. The ones who are actually doing what they say they are are quieter about it, so it produces the appearance of them being arseholes, when it's only that the arseholes are making themselves known. If one person doesn't believe in the holocaust and supports GamerGate, that doesn't mean the rest of GamerGate agrees with him - that idea is absurd. 

Next, let's see...I don't see much to say regarding Sarkeesian. It was an anonymous threat, was it not? Anyone can claim to be on any side of a debate when they're anonymous. If GamerGate as a whole is trying not to seem like misogynists, this would be counterproductive. Then it's logical to assume that this person is either something of a rogue element, or a person who is against GamerGate and trying to make them look bad, or just a troll who wants to stir up more controversy. Then again, it's important to note that it *could* be an actual member of GamerGate. It's not possible to say as fact either way. 

On the last one; I don't know who that person is. I've heard their name somewhere, though. I don't subscribe to this alpha/beta male bullshit. It's just a way for people to feel superior over their cocky and annoying behaviour, because they can claim to be the alpha, the top dog. It's a bunch of shit. The person in that article is not making any reference to support his statement that the murderer's fantasies were shaped by video games, only stating it. Additionally, the phrasing ""It's  a new low for the video game industry"" is unfair. A mod is a mod, not a developer supported addon. It's placing the blame for disgusting mods on the developers who had nothing to do with it, rather than the creeps who actually made it. 

As for Jack Thompson? Well, do you have to care much for video games to care about the journalism surrounding them? It wouldn't surprise me if a person was annoyed with any corrupt industry. 

In the end, I think you've forgotten something very important. *People are people*. One person is not, and can never, be people. Taking the actions, and beliefs of a few, as if they're the whole, is ridiculous. It's just a cheap shortcut to give you something to attack. It's not right. Its like saying that Dog Owners must all be bad because Hitler was a dog owner. You're painting everyone with the same brush because of only a few people. You can't assume that everyone in *any* group shares all beliefs, or even most, with everyone else. It's not reasonable.

You're missing my point. They haven't let their voters down. Their voters are just too stupid to realise it.

I never said they should. Don't put words in my mouth. My point was simply that the LDs have not let their supporters down in such a way that deserves desertion from the party.

And then insisted that *no such debate should take place otherwise*, in short using the sexism label instead of a rational argument - again, imagine if someone make a public statement about a circumcision debate that was based on 'well, a woman just wouldn't understand' - it would be laughed at, and rightly so. Owning physiology doesn't give someone a unique insight that can't be easily garnerd from existing research - hence you don't need to be able to drive a car to know that seatbelts are a good idea.

Why? It doesn't change anything, certainly at this level - an Oxford debate is usually going to be more informed than a conversation in a pub.

November/December through to spring is quiet for bike sales, if they sell gear too they will sell a bit for Xmas gifts and such, but they will be really dead in January.

Remember that businesses need monthly turnover to pay their overheads and staff, so if you want to strengthen your hand, play hard ball negotiation at the end of the month: they will be looking to boost the months figures, even if its a less favourable deal, as long as they're not losing money, they might just take it.

Getting gear at the same time can give you a discount on either bike or gear, but not on both at the same time. They might not want to lose out on both, but could break-even on a lid to sell a bike for a profit. My advice on this would be to buy the lid you want seperately somewhere else and hard negotiate for the bike as a stand alone.

If you have time on your hands, be patient - the best deals will be haggled out in the last week of January.

Disability ect

Like i said in the post, its not all people, but i personally know of people that have specifically made themselves homeless in order to go into a hostel while still pregnant.

It is up to GG to push them out of the movement or denounce them which they have for the most part and also have taken steps to stop those that dox and troll.

Just to state, as I have elsewhere,  I am neutral but leaning GG simply because whist there are tens of thousands of them working towards what they see is an important issue, the fault in Videogame Journalism and in my opinion; as a fan of Adam Curtis all [Journalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSwlqSwwqvQ) is an important issue. I have seen both sides have their members with dodgy pasts or participate in bulling. 

As for the examples well from what I can see GGers pushed [King of Pol](http://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2l1fma/king_of_pol_going_full_holocaust_denial_on_ia/) from the movement for the outburst (which in politics is pretty common and you can't hold the entire political party to task forever for it) The doxxer [TheRalphReport](http://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2m7y94/what_the_hell_ralph_retort/) Was also criticised and seen as a tabloid muck raker of which both sides have them in spades. The Anita threats are serious and I don't condone them, nor do I think the majority of those with GG but they were found to be not a serious threat in that instance. Never heard of Davis Aurini before but again he sounds like a right so-and-so who is an extremist.

Milo is a reporter not on either side but thinks it is a good story. He is a little conservative for my tastes but he is entitled to his views. I much prefer [David Pakman's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9fiz35EP2I&amp;list=UUvixJtaXuNdMPUGdOPcY8Ag) reporting. Jack Thompson has views I don't agree with but again he is entitled to have them. I think he comes at the issue of gaming from a more US centric viewpoint that has advisory instead of a rating system that prevents young adults from purchasing under-age material. A system I think works well in the UK to let younger children be subject to their parents permission to play violent games.

I don't see how GG as a whole is gross and toxic and I don't see how their critics are either simply because of the shitty behaviour and past of an extremist few.

If he had meant what you think he meant, then when he was asked, ""Could a Polish plumber and his family be deported?"" he would have said, ""No, there is absolutely no chance of that because:

&gt; Those who have a job and have been here a number of years would not be at risk

And

&gt; The only people who might have to leave are unemployed immigrants who have not been here very long, but that is basically the same system we have currently when it comes to rules from immigration from the EU

So therefore a Polish plumber who has been here a while would not be at risk""

But he didn't - he said that the best UKIP could offer was to 'look sympathetically' at that plumber. If I were a Pole who had been here many years - working hard and paying taxes - I would not want my future in the UK to be under even a hint of a shadow of a doubt; I would not want to - to give a specific example - rely on the 'sympathy' of a UKIP-appointed immegration board as the only defence I had for not being deported. So I think it is absolutely right the media report the comment, and indeed make a big deal about it.

I could easily believe that it was a gaffe after a tough election campaign, in which case Reckless should have apologised for misspeaking (as far as I know he hasn't - if he has there's no issue). I could also believe Reckless genuinely hasn't understood UKIP policy on the issue and if UKIP took power his minority view would not be national policy (UKIP were quick to distance themselves from Reckless' comments). But I can't believe that so many UKIP supporters actually heard Reckless say what you claim to have heard him say - it just doesn't match up with the quotes or the context of the discussion. I think that is why it has become such a big story - UKIP supporters are feeding the fire by claiming the comments are defensible in some way, which shows either that they haven't understood why the comments as spoken (maybe not as intended) are absolutely *not* defensible or (more likely) are reacting 'tribally' to defend one of their own (like certain members of the left are defending that stupid Thornberry tweet just because she is Labour).",0,1416574710,null,0,false,0,cm8we2m,t3_2mybgj,t1_cm8we2m,t1_cm8w3uk,null,1425912791,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

From Wikipedia: Dyson is a long time supporter of the European single currency and was one of the chairmen and chief executives of the 20 FTSE 100 companies who signed a statement published in the Financial Times in 1998 calling on the government for early British membership in the eurozone. He claimed that failure to join the Euro would lead to the destruction of the British manufacturing base and said: ""It does not mean that the jobs will go tomorrow but will drift abroad over a period and the longer-term future of Britain as a manufacturing nation will be blighted. Ministers had better understand that if we delay entry too long there may be nothing left to save.""

Claiming that the strength of the pound was affecting his company's profits on exports to France and Germany, in February 2000 Dyson threatened to shift focus from his Malmesbury plant to a new plant set up in Malaysia because the government would not join the euro. He said: ""We would expect to double in size in the next two years. We are talking about a £100 million investment and up to 2,000 jobs. I would like to make that investment in the UK. But it seems that is not going to be possible. The value of sterling means we are struggling to compete at home with cheap imports from Europe and the Far East. We do around £40 million worth of export business with France and Germany each year but we aren't making any money. If we joined the euro we would be on an even footing with our biggest trading partners."" An editorial published in The Times responded: ""Mr Dyson, a manufacturing version of Sir Richard Branson, likes complaining. Yesterday he was complaining that Britain's failure to join the euro and the resultant strong pound will force him to move abroad. Last week he blamed the price of land and planning delays in Wiltshire, but never mind. So where will he go? To Portugal, Italy or to an EU candidate such as Poland? No, Mr Dyson threatens to go to the Far East. Like so many entrepreneurs, he wants a cheap currency and low interest rates, but also low inflation, low wages, a flexible labour market and low regulation. He will not find them in the eurozone."" Norman Tebbit, a former Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, also questioned Dyson's motives and said: ""[W]hat still puzzles me is why such a euro-enthusiast as Mr Dyson does not intend to establish his new factory in Europe if he can't have it in Britain.""

Dyson again threatened to shift production abroad in November 2000, saying: ""It's suicidal for the UK not to join the euro. Why should we go on exporting at a loss? We're facing unfair competition."" In February 2002, Dyson announced that production was finally being shifted to the Far East and admitted that ""the driving force was hard cash. Wages in the Far East are less than half those expected in Britain, while it is 30 per cent cheaper to make a vacuum cleaner."" Roger Lyons, general secretary of the manufacturing union Amicus, said: ""Dyson has betrayed the 800 people whose jobs are being shipped out and hundreds more from supply companies.

Then I'd probably hit them with a 'dance' track, something cute and bubbly, I like this mash-up between [Lil' Jon and Lazy Town](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryog-cgp9_I)

Then you'll need a solid crowd pleaser, a legend, how about Lou Reed? His [Metal Machine Music] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtzNl48F60) has been getting people dancing for ages and is a proven winner 

Lastly, how about an instrumental that has it's own unique dance (don't worry, the crowd will soon pick it up when you start doing it to show them) so I'd end with the beautiful piano track from the movie [Calvaire] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1owrlQlLExY) - it's the best dance ever and crowds go wild for it.

At this point it is sensible to consider every system as compromised and to act accordingly. Establishing private connections using open source standard-compliant software is the only way forward. If the source is closed you cannot be sure your data is safe.

Things like [StartTLS interception on IP networks](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/11/starttls-downgrade-attacks) are happening in the US and it wouldn't surprise me if that spread to the UK in due course. It might be a bit too overt for our guys liking. The attack exploits the trusting nature of email servers into sending information as plain text rather than nicely encrypted messages.

I am a bit doom-and-gloom on the present situation but the public is only in this position because our intelligence services have attacked us and caught us almost totally unawares. Security will be a big thing in the next 5 - 10 years as everyone rushes to get end-to-end encryption in place using strong ciphers. Open Source will be held up as a way of maintaining the transparency people will require. We may see proprietary systems moving that way too.

The other aspect of this massive invasion of privacy is 'linkability' where they want to build a profile of you and your life. Where you move, where you spend your money, who you associate with, what you like, what you don't like. A comprehensive list of who and what you are as a person.

I based my comments both on what Reckless said in those two sentences, and what I know to be UKIPs position on immigration.

There is a lot of anger over immigration, and his party is campaigning on the basis of reducing it. The reason he used the word sympathetically is that he is trying to explain his position as being tough on immigration, while still remembering that immigrants are human beings.

""The polish plumber should be allowed to stay because he is contributing. The circumstances under which he arrived were unfair and bad for Britain, but now that he is here we must look sympathetically at him.

false,Melancholicdrunk,null,null,"You know *of* people, or you *know* people? Working in homeless services for a long time makes me very skeptical when people talk about making yourself homeless being a viable option to get housing. Councils are very strict on this, to get into homeless hostels you can't have made yourself homeless. This means things like, walking out of a house where you were being beaten up every day is making yourself intentionally homeless, you get no help. Witholding your rent in a property the landlord refuses to upkeep is making yourself intentionally homeless, you get no help. Being thrown out of your parents house can count as intentionally homeless if ""you haven't tried hard enough to repair the relationship"". 

After years of working in homeless hostels I don't think I've come across anyone who has just walked into a council house because they wanted one and decided to live on the streets for a week. Do you have any idea how horrible it is sleeping rough? Have you ever been in a homeless hostel? Because I don't know of anyone who'd choose to live in one while pregnant. They're horrible.

false,LimitlessLTD,eng-Surrey,Surreeh,"&gt; Yes, the EU is exceptionally undemocratic. It's far to large to be representative of the people how fall under it's jurisdiction.

Youve just equated two completely different things to mean the same, you talk of it being un-democratic but dont explain why, then go on to say its un-representative because its ""too large"", what does that even mean? Is there too many people in the EU? or too many nations? Perhaps you mean there are too many MEPs? How can i debate such a vague statement?

&gt; The EU is made up a very diverse set of nations; there shouldn't be a one size fits all approach to policy making what works for us a relatively rich service economy would not work for a poorer manufacturing based economy.

What policy making? Again so vague i have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. For starters the UK isnt in the Eurozone so their monetary and fiscal policies do not even effect us.

Secondly what does a ""one size fits all"" approach mean? When countries ascend to the EU, the transition is slow; barriers are still in place for the first ~5 years of the ascension and many policies are not enacted within those countries until its felt the time is write.

&gt; The fact is if all of the UK MEP, the people we voted in, voted a certain way on a matter, but against the grain of the majority of the EU MEPs then we'd have to do as we're told.

But thats called democracy, and earlier you where complaining about how undemocratic the EU is. Im so confused.

&gt; We have to decide what the atom size is of policy, I think country wide is big enough, continent is far too large.

You are talking as if the EU effects literally all policies, it doesnt. The EU actually has implemented policies which have effected a total of ~15% of all UK laws.

I 100% agree with your statement though, and currently national governments still enact policies that are localised which is what i want. Just like the US, devolution of power to the regional level and the federal government being in charge of nation(or in this case continent) wide stuff such as large infrastructure and R&amp;D projects, fiscal and monetary policy whilst .

&gt; Not to mention that if you think west minster has an expenses problem the EU is on a whole other level.

Westminster had an expenses problem in 2009, the EU still has an expenses problem now. There are MEPs working towards trying to cut the amount of allowances, the MEP pay, the overpriced cars they get for free. I also want MEPs reduced allowances and the removal of the expensive cars, but i think the pay should stay the same. It means that the EU attracts some of the best talent in Europe and they are not poached by the private sector where they can make fairly considerable sums of money.

&gt; I do not want to leave the EU entirely, but I definitely am in favour of renegotiating our position with it as well as bringing in some EU reform, and luckily, it seems the two main parties are going to do that to some extent.

Im 100% behind you, the EU needs reform just as Westminster needs reform and every other political system. But working within the political framework is what we need to do. Voting UKIP is just a protest vote, they do *NOTHING* in the EU, they complain whine and generally detract from European debates.",0,1416576662,null,0,false,0,cm8wxtc,t3_2mwo82,t1_cm8wxtc,t1_cm8vfvd,null,1425912535,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Well that's is where I disagree.

If all our MEPs voted a certain way on something that effects us Nationally (IE the way in which we do something that has no direct effect on other EU nations) and yet we have to do as we are told then quite frankly I don't believe that is democratic. We have no power to effect change in our own country, and I have no interest in effecting change in other peoples country.

Consider the hypothetical, if country A allows jaywalking and country B &amp; C doesn't. All MEPS of country A want to continue allowing it but none of country B &amp; C want to ensure there is no jaywalking their union then it's my opinion that's it's not fair or even democratic to force A to change, it's outside of the remit of what a multi country union should be.

If you can understand that then I can not go on debating the issue.

&gt;  But working within the political framework is what we need to do.

Accept if we are unable to affect change inside of the EU in terms of the way it works, and yes I guess we'll see if we can or not, then what does that say about our influence on the policies being made by the EU (go back to my point about being undemocratic).

&gt;It is depressing how effective propaganda is. David Cameron poses with people in blackface and it is deemed ""tradition"", a random MP takes a number of photos of a place she is in and one of them is contrived to be ""disgusting"". Ed Miliband forgets to mention the deficit in one speech and it is a clear sign of incompetence, Cameron doesn't realise he has a £1.7 billion bill to pay and it is somehow the EU's fault. Nigel Farage is recorded stating he wants to privatise the NHS and Mark Reckless says he wants to deport people already here legally and it is accepted they mispoke but Miliband is awful because he didn't donate to a beggar correctly. Cameron gave a speech about austerity while wearing robes and sitting in a golden throne but Miliband is out of touch because he ate a sandwich wrong.

Why should we look 'sympathetically' at Polish plumbers who have paid taxes for a decade or more? If Englishness means anything, they are English. Worse, 'sympathetic' can mean a lot of different things to different people - it doesn't rule out deporting those plumbers once UKIP comes to power (or if the political winds change). However you (and a lot of the UKIP-friendly media) interpreted it as meaning something a bit stronger than an expression of a mere feeling and more like a statement of policy, as in, ""We should be unsympathetic to people who have only just arrived (and therefore deport them), but sympathetic to people who have been here a long time (and therefore allow them to stay)"".

So while that may have been what he was *trying* to say, what he *actually* said seemed to fit much better with my interpretation (again - I can't stress what a big deal it is that he didn't answer the question in a straightforward way, especially since UKIP brand themselves as the party who 'tells it like it is'). I don't think we're going to get much further debating this, because while you've helped me understand why UKIP think these comments weren't a big deal, I don't think the media were wrong to draw attention to them; even assuming the best possible spin for Mr Reckless it was a horrible gaffe where he failed to explain UKIP policy in anything like a coherent way.

May I ask another question? Would you be this charitable to an MP from any other party who made a gaffe like this? For example, if Thornberry had said, ""I was tweeting a photo of that white van man's flags because I was pleased at the display of patriotism"" would you have said, ""Ok, I guess that makes sense and it is unfair to hold you to the more obvious interpretation of your actions""?

Thank you for your Freedom of Information request received on 28 October. You asked for the following -

I would like to know whether you have ever used sock-puppet twitter accounts, that is, fake accounts where you, via your press office, purport to be genuine members of the public praising Universal Credit. If you have used sock-puppet accounts then I request you reveal how many and what are the names of these fake identities. This is a form of deception.

I make this request because it would seem that an operator of the DWP Press Office twitter account accidentally copied and pasted a message intended for a sock puppet account, from the DWP Press Office twitter account. An embarrassing error. The tweet can be found here: https://twitter.com/latentexistence/status/526801670588874753?s=09

and is from DWP Press Office @dwppressoffice, dated 27th Oct 2014 @ 11:17am

it reads: ""Thanks to #UniversalCredit, I'm in a permenant job now""

Response:
DWP does not use ‘fake’ Twitter accounts. The tweet referenced had a spelling mistake so we took it down. A high level of critical interest meant that we decided not to reissue it in case our supportive Universal Credit claimant was subject to abuse.
A list of DWP social media accounts and usage policy is published on GOV.UK here:

It could be questioned how well such policies would work in action too - afterall exercise IS free already.

It costs nothing to walk somewhere.

The only cost involved in jogging is a pair of trainers.

And eating less burgers and more brocolli is a pretty good investment.

The reality is, most of us are lazy gubbins and eat badly - and we know it.

We need to be more responsible for ourselves - and not blame the council for our being fat because they didn't give us free treadmills to use.

Try NOT buying a burger from the burger van.

Try having a cup of tea WITHOUT a biscuit.

Have a glass of water instead of a coca-cola.

I'm guilty of editorialising the headline (to be fair, I didn't know that was against the rules until someone pointed it out to me here - will try to be less naughty in future) - but the point I wanted to provoke is the whole ""softly-softly"" approach on obesity isn't working. 

I think the public health message on this may need to be harder. If you're obese - that ultimately is YOUR fault - and therefore YOUR responsibility to get it back under control.

The current climate is so against that though. Time to change it I think.

Here's Ricky Gervais to lighten the mood, and convey a similar point, if in a little harsh way...

Democracy quite literally means the majority of people will get their way regardless of the minorities disagreements. So im afraid that you are completely wrong on this part.

&gt; If all our MEPs voted a certain way on something that effects us Nationally (IE the way in which we do something that has no direct effect on other EU nations) and yet we have to do as we are told then quite frankly I don't believe that is democratic.

Has the EP ever voted on an issue that effects just one nation and none others? No, because those issues are solved at the National level and will never (or at least not for an incredibly long time) be dictated by Brussels.

&gt; If you can understand that then I can not go on debating the issue.

The point is moot because national governments deal with issues that effect only themselves. Where do you even get this idea that Brussels dictates every policy regardless of who it effects?

&gt; We have no power to effect change in our own country, and I have no interest in effecting change in other peoples country.

Not even if it was to protect the environment, human rights, accountability or transparency? These are the sorts of things the EU initiates. That and large infrastructure, development and modernisation projects.

&gt; Accept if we are unable to affect change inside of the EU in terms of the way it works

""British Influence said its scorecard, based on a cross-party analysis of Britain's progress across a range of EU policies in 2013, showed London had been successful in 20 areas and failed in only four.""

""Presenting what it said would be an annual scorecard of Britain's progress in Europe, British Influence said London was on track to meet nine out of 10 of its EU policy goals and was a force to be reckoned with in the 28-nation bloc.""

The evidence is to the contrary.

&gt; then what does that say about our influence on the policies being made by the EU (go back to my point about being undemocratic).

You dont seem to understand democracy, you are mixing it up with representation. You cant just change the definition of words because you dont like something.

I can't see the UKIP surge being any more than a way to channel these feelings into votes, but given the lack of depth in their manifesto one can only wonder just how bad they would be if they were in power.

You're dead right in that education must be part of the solution, shame that teachers and headmasters are getting such a royal buggering by the powers that be, though. On that note I'd like to leave you with a rather charming little anecdote. For a few years I was working at Imperial College London, one of my colleagues (a Spaniard) told me about her youngest daughter who'd recently started at Primary School. The daughter, Lily, was being raised to speak both English and Spanish, and was as fluent in both languages as a 5 or 6 year old could be. The teacher thought he'd ask Lily to help teach (or integrate, YMMV) a new pupil who'd recently arrived from China. Lily gladly agreed to help the new pupil, and promised to help the new girl learn English.

For some reason the new pupil just couldn't get on in class. She'd participate as best as she could, always at Lily's side, but after a few weeks her English was still non-existent. On the other hand, her Spanish was bloody marvellous.

Lily wasn't ever asked to help in that fashion again.",0,1416578751,null,0,false,0,cm8xmdz,t3_2mwx0e,t1_cm8xmdz,t1_cm8vrpg,null,1425912217,2,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,2
false,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;This seems like it should have a pretty straightforward answer (""No, I don't support that""), so I feel like even if I didn't know that UKIP were generally an anti-immigration party I would be extremely worried about an MP who didn't give a straightforward answer to the question.

I too would prefer if all politicians were more straight talking, and I agree it probably would have been better if he had just said no we would not deport anyone.

But I recognise that he was in the middle of an election campaign, and that the public in this constituency were tired of what they perceived to be politicians who were weak on the issues caused by immigration.

I see his comments not as being directed at the wider public, but specifically directed to potential UKIP voters in Rochester, who are upset with immigration. 

With this in mind, his comment seems to be reassurance that immigration will be dealt with robustly, but still with humanity and compassion for the people already here. 

I think it's also important to remember that UKIP is not an anti-immigration party. They believe in good quality immigration, around 50,000-60,000 per year are the numbers most quoted. I don't think it  would make sense to kick out thousands of immigrants, only to allow thousands back in at the same time. 

&gt;Would you be this charitable to an MP from any other party who made a gaffe like this? For example, if Thornberry had said, ""I was tweeting a photo of that white van man's flags because I was pleased at the display of patriotism"" would you have said, ""Ok, I guess that makes sense and it is unfair to hold you to the more obvious interpretation of your actions""?

When I first saw the story about the tweet, I did assume that it was posted out of snobbery, and I did think negatively of what she had done. However, I also assumed that she would claim otherwise as you said. I though it was an unfortunate thing to post, but that it would be relatively easy to explain herself out of trouble, and that in the end, no one would really know what here intentions were. I thought it would all blow over very quickly. I certainly was not going to start bringing it up in other discussions. 

I was genuinely shocked that she resigned, and I think it's was the worst decisions that could have been made, because it basically confirms all of the worst suspicions people had about why she posted it. 

I was prepared to give her the benefit of the doubt before she resigned, but definitely not now she has.  ",0,1416578757,null,0,false,0,cm8xmhi,t3_2mybgj,t1_cm8xmhi,t1_cm8x9ec,null,1425912215,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights—Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of ""need"".

3. Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause—The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial, ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc. 	

4. Supremacy of the Military—Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized. 

5. Rampant Sexism—The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Opposition to abortion is high, as is homophobia and anti-gay legislation and national policy. 

6. Controlled Mass Media—Sometimes the media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or through sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in wartime, is very common.

7. Obsession with National Security—Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses. 	

8. Religion and Government are Intertwined—Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions. 

9. Corporate Power is Protected—The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.


10. Labor Power is Suppressed—Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely or are severely suppressed.

11. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts—Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free-expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts. 	

12. Obsession with Crime and Punishment—Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses, and even forego civil liberties, in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.

13. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption—Fascist regimes are almost always governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions, and who use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.

14. Fraudulent Elections—Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against (or even the assassination of) opposition candidates, the use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and the manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.",0,1416578897,null,0,false,0,cm8xoav,t3_2mybgj,t1_cm8xoav,t1_cm8x9m6,null,1425912192,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

Then what happens, is people who by chance turned out to be good managers, get spotted and get promoted to senior management (and/or get a better paying job elsewhere ;)). The people who stay at the mid level management? The people who've 'earned it' by being senior, but who are so bad at actually managing people and projects that nobody wants to promote them or hire them elsewhere.

So they become perpetual middle-managers who probably don't actually like managing, unable to move on because they lack management competence, but unwilling to move back down.

On the flipside, you can train someone to be the best manager in the world, and get them to lead a project, but then end up having the team resent them because they haven't done the 'grunt work' and 'earned' their management stripes.

You've also slightly changed my view so that I now think Reckless probably misspoke badly rather than actually holding the view the press are ascribing to him, but I still don't think it reflects well on him as a politician. I now also understand why you think this is a storm in a teacup, although I don't agree this is the left 'spinning' - I hope I have been able to convince you there is a perfectly natural interpretation of Reckless' words that imply quite strongly that he *would* consider deporting people who have been here a decade or more. On the other hand, you have (*just*) convinced me there is a (more-or-less) natural interpretation of his words where he says, in effect, 'We should be tough on most immigrants, but compassionate towards people who have been here a long time', which is what tipped me towards 'misspeaking' rather than 'horrible person'.

Our prisoners cant vote, that failed so this point is moot...

&gt; does it really effect Europe how powerful our vacuum cleaners are?

To understand why this happened you need to know about current events.

The EU is trying to dramatically increase its energy efficiency. This is because of the threat of Russian gas and oil being cut off from Europe.

The EU deemed that electronics producing companies that make high powered vacuum cleaners and other power intensive devices  where not doing enough to ensure competition in terms of energy efficiency.

It is one of a number of initiatives the EU has undertaken to increase energy efficiency across Europe. It also effects **every EU country** so it is not even a localised issue.

I would have preferred that the EU actually just introduce policies that make the consumer aware of how much power their devices consume, but this would have been spun as ""bureaucratic red tape"" by UKIP and other euro-sceptics. As well as this im not sure how effective it would be because 1 device that consumes slightly more doesnt tend to lead to a massive increase in power bills. But the effect is cumulative, so 100,000 powerful vacuum cleaners that are all more efficient will add up.

It is not just random meddling but part of Europes energy efficiency initiative in order to reduce our reliance on belligerent and un-cooperative nations (Russia).",0,1416580823,null,0,false,0,cm8yewa,t3_2mwo82,t1_cm8yewa,t1_cm8y2qn,null,1425911847,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Dedicated polling has been done. It's not unsubstantiated, it's actual research by IpsosMORI and the London School of Economics.

Leading lecturers have completely undermined Farage's statements on ""NHS immigrants"". 

The Department of Health is confused by his statements saying he's super inflating a tiny fraction of 1%.
 
Macmillan Cancer Support said they were also unfounded. 

20/20 Health said it was a ""xenophobic, vitriolic claim by Farage is a dangerous fabrication.""

In fact NO cancer specialist of any standing has backed up his claims.

Most Britons overstate the proportion of Muslims in their country by a factor of four. 

Most people from the UK also think immigrants make up twice the proportion of the population as is really the case.

As the MD of IpsuMORI said ""These misperceptions present clear issues for informed public debate and policymaking. Public priorities may well be different if we had a clearer view of the scale of immigration""

I said that in the light of the evidence you don't want to have REASONED DEBATE. You didn't then try to undermine the research or present alternative figures - you try to shut the debate down with parallels of the US and saying the claims are 'unsubstantiated' and why you 'hate reddit'.

I've never understood the love that continues to flow for Bale. I loved him as much as anyone when he was with us, I really did, but it will never sit right with me that when he still had five (four?) years on his contract and Madrid came a calling, offering more money, trophies and fame he pretty quickly packed up and left. Isn't that the really easy thing to do and something we shouldn't say ""oh well"" to and pretend like its not a direct insult to the fans and the team you have a contract with? 

Perhaps I never understood how its ok in soccer for this to happen, since if a player ever did this on a baseball team (only other sport I follow), he would be crucified.

Bale had a chance to become maybe the all-time great with us, but instead left to become an anonymous name in the Madrid timeline. He cashed out (and I'm not blaming him, by any means) - he didn't do the honorable great thing and leave in a way that should make him a hero. I mean saying things like ""I still want Spurs to win"" is just common sense, why wouldn't he say that? It only serves to increase his fame back in the UK, but his actions spoke a whole lot louder than a pretty empty quote years later.

The EU had its roots in old-fashioned Socialism and now, yet again, we see that Socialism NEVER takes into account human nature. Greed, self-interest and psychopathy will ALWAYS win the race.
Politicians have tried, tried and tried again to legislate against human nature. It never works and it's time they stopped meddling.
