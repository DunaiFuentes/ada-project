The bonds vs equities balance is the most well discussed one. Assuming you are moving towards a cashing out point like retirement, you want volatility to reduce as you approach that point. This is often achieved by increasing the % of bonds slowly over time. (This is often the default setting for a defined contributions pension for example).

The old rule was subtract your age from 100 and hold that equity and the rest in bonds. The puts a 20 year old at 20% bonds. Many people feel this too conservative and favour moving to bonds a later.

Then you need to think about how to sub divide the asset classes. I like a half and half between gilts and linkers in my bonds, but I'm still thinking about a Corp bond allocation.

The equity needs sub dividing too. Emerging vs developed vs domestic is another. The FTSE alone is not bad as it is probably the most international of all indexes, but I like a big slug of the other two. I'm adding REITS, small cap, value and other sidecars over time.

Don't forget cash and always rebalance (or buy a vanguard lifestyle fund and forget about all this).

She asked him nicely “sorry, could you move your car that’s my house I’m not long after an operation and there is no other spaces” (the driveway was taken up by their other car.) the guy said “wise up I got the space, wind ur neck in”(I actually think he told her to “fuck off”) so being pissed off she left the car in the middle of the street, I said I would go and find a parking space and move it back round after the match. So I got the keys and found a parking spot a few streets down, when I got back I saw her standing at the guy who was being cunt..s car, I thought nothing of it and went into the house, asked my girlfriend what her mum was doing. Turns out she got some dog shit from their back garden and wiped it over his door handle…. And the window. I found this hilarious for the rest of the night going out for a smoke every hour or so to see if I could get the guys reaction but no such luck… safe to  say he had a shitty hand on the way home.

Moral of the story, if a resident asks you nicely to move your car since your right infront of their house, I would advise doing it.  With that said “keying” someones car is pathetic and you deserve to be punished, at least dog shit you can wipe off and doesn’t cost you anything, other than a smelly hand.

true,tfw13579,flair8,,"I'm really late to this thread and thought this was an interesting conversation that I wanted to weigh in on. In terms of transitions, I don't think that particular formations are better at switching from offenses to defense than others. What makes for better transitions is the rigidity of the tactics. When you line up differently in attack and defense, it causes players to move out of their defensive position in order to take up their attacking one. 

Look at AVB's tactics for example. AVB line up in a 4-2-3-1  offensively and effectively lined up 4-5-1 or 4-4-1-1 defensively: four defenders, than banks of 4 or 5 midfielders in front of them depending on the game. His tactics were very rigid. If Siggy started on the left side, he was there for most of the entire game, if Dembele started in the middle, he'd move around a bit to receive the ball and make passes, but he'd usually stay towards the middle and was rarely caught forward. This makes transitioning very easy because players were rarely caught out of position and were usually able to quickly move towards the defensive shape. This is what made us so defensively sound when AVB was manager but also stifled our attack because of a lack of freedom.

Now lets look at Sherwoods tactics. His tactics are much more fluid and allow for much more rotation. Throughout most of his games as manager, the left mid has basically moved inside on offense to make the offensive shape a lopsided 4-3-3, with Dembele holding, Eriksen and Paulinho/Benteleb in front, Ade at a very narrow LW position, Soldado at ST, and Lennon at RW. The defensive shape, though, has been a 4-4-2. Eriksen has had to make up a lot of ground at times moving between the offensive and defensive phases to get from his central attacking position to his left sided defensive position. The freedom given to Eriksen in this fluid formation allows him to influence the attack a lot but causes him to be drawn out of position often, leaving space open on the left side during transitions that is only compounded when Rose goes forward to attack.

WindyCOYS did a good analysis of the first goal [here](http://windycoys.com/2014/01/analysis-of-the-goal-conceded-against-arsenal-41-plus-some-thoughts-and-a-competition/) that gives good insight and shows pictures that may be able to illustrate the transition.

While I agree that its important to try to exploit other teams weaknesses, its also important to play to our strengths. AVB didn't do that enough IMO, and played players out of position far too often. I think we've looked better offensively because Sherwood is playing to our strengths. Also, Arsenal don't really have many weaknesses. Besides the fact that they don't really have a defensive mid, they're probably as solid as it comes. I think Sherwood did a good job tactically. We created chances, and I don't think we got overrun in the midfield too badly. As mentioned early, Arsenal didn't create many chances when we were able to successfully transition. There's only so much he can do. The rest is up to the players.",0,1389170901,null,0,false,0,cekbk7r,t3_1uf6aj,t1_cekbk7r,t1_cehx1ow,null,1431850940,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

The exemption is £10,900 for this tax year ending 5 April 2014. However, as more and more businesses accept Bitcoin in payment then you can begin to see that this is not in the nature of investment and more like a currency exchange.  I suggest the tax treatment is informed by the Bitcoin holder's intention, that is, either to: 
* Hold for investment in the expectation of realising an overall gain on the growth in value of the Bitcoins; 
* Use as a currency in exchange for goods and services, moving funds abroad, etc; 
* Trading in Bitcoins themselves as a business venture; or,
* A combination of options.

As mentioned, if holding as an investment you will most likely find your gains are taxed under Capital Gains rules.  If you run a business using Bitcoin as currency you will still be liable for reporting that business in Uk Sterling to HM Revenue &amp; Customs, Companies House (if a limited company) and other interested parties.  So your Bitcoin values would need to be converted to Uk Sterling for these either at the date of transaction or using an average for the year value ( these are provided by HMRC for foreign currencies so perhaps they will have to negotiate this too). Your business income tax or corporation tax would need to be paid in UK Sterling.  

VAT doesn't seem to be appropriate in the situations of holding Bitcoin as an investment. Though where it is used as a currency then VAT could still apply to the value of the transaction and be reported to HMRC at its UK Sterling equivalent.  For those actually trading in Bitcoins then VAT may be chargeable on it, depending on HMRC and government policy.

true,wil123456,null,null,"I have some (ableit personal, not professional) experience with employment law, and want to add to this:
&gt;I think you should keep records of interactions so that if you are ever discriminated against in future you can use this. Technically they have violated employment law already. 

It is *crucial* you keep good records, even if it's something as simple as a diary, as it adds so much more weight than ""he said she said"" should it ever end up in court. You might not think it'll end up in court at the moment but if it escalates, and you end up out of work for a year, you'll have good records.

&gt;In fact it is unambiguously illegal to require employees to works less than minimum statutory annual leave in order to be considered for advancement, however employers can specify that you take your holiday in certain ways e.g. give two weeks notice. 

The employment and constructive dismissal laws are wierd, in that you don't *have* to be sacked in order to be sacked, i.e. if the conditions you are being forced to work under are so unreasonable you walk out, that is the same as the company sacking you. You can then take them to court for unfair / constructive dismissal. Also, this doesn't have to be a one time only thing, it can build up over time, and a ""final straw"". If your boss is only persucuting you and no one else, that is also discrimination. This is why good records are crucial. 

If you do go back to work, make it absolutely clear you are returning to work ""under protest"" and wish to raise an official grievance with your employer. A change is being made to your contract without discussion or consent. Now the grievance procedure (if there even is one) will probably be a complete sham, but that doesn't matter so long as you have followed correct procedure. If you don't raise a protest it is taken as given you have accepted the new conditions / change to your contract. Having said all that the change to your contract is illegal so I don't know wtf they are thinking. Also, contracts don't have to be written they can be verbal and carry the same weight. After the grievance procedure, go to ACAS, they offer a mediation service. After that, find a solicitor and quit (they are expensive though, so only bother if you've been screwed a lot in wages)

Source: my wife took her boss to court after bullying her out of her old job, she had emails going back years with all this documented, he tried to demote her and she walked out, sued him for constructive dismissal and discrimination. The court pays you what you have lost between jobs (so if you get a job straight away its hardly worth it) plus a sum for discrimination (if it occurs)

The most effective mechanism to change the system if we agree with the hypothesis that *private landlords are not the best option to house vulnerable people* would likely be a profit motive one way or the other.

You could do this by increasing profit opportunities for housing more people, or by decreasing profit opportunities for *not* housing more people and/or rent-seeking behaviours.

However, I do think that the Meta-Crisis (Tennant's semi regeneration) should not be counted as a Doctor, but as a regeneration. The reason for this is that in the christmas special it is made clear that Tennants semi regeneration is counted towards the maximum number of regenerations the doctor can have. 
This makes the regeneration that happened in the christmas the 13 regeneration.

But, I do also count Capaldi as the 13th doctor; why you ask? 
Elementary me dear Whovian; Tennant's semi-regeneration is the same as Tennant, or at least it seems that way, with both of them having the same memories.


This, to me at least, means that Capaldi should be called number 13.

I remember once a few years back, I was with a photography group near Buckingham palace.  I was meant to be giving a walking tour as I knew that part of London well.  A policemen comes up and asks what we are doing, explain, tell him the name of the group, explain some of these people have come from Paris, and they do the same for us.  He starts becoming a bit of a jerk *do you have permission to take photographs of this building* I reply something about not needing them.  Trouble starts, we get a little bit of a lecture he starts to demand to review the photographs and such, but only of this one French guys camera (everyone had DSLRs) he also was the only non-white person in the group, but meh.  He politely objects to this, asking if this is legal in the UK.  The policeman asks again if the people in the building would like having their building photographed by a suspicious group of people.  I reply with, I really don't mind, but I will ask xxxxx if that matters when I see him on Monday.  The penny drops on this policeman, his partner looks embarrassed so I offer them a coffee *the view from the top board room is great, and they just got this amazing coffee machine, are you sure you don't want one, as acting head of technology they wont mind me bringing in some visitors*.

The worst one was a 4 bed detached house. The bedrooms were small which is not too bad in itself but the kitchen was shocking. There was no room for anything other than a small under the counter fridge. No room for a dishwasher or washing machine. No plumbing either, they built a kitchen with no physical space or plumbing for a washing machine! 

There was also no garage. This meant that had the buyers wanted a washing machine they would have either had to have it in the living room (and paid for the plumbing to be moved there) or plumb it in outside in a shed (again with electrics and plumbing put out there)

S60 of Criminal Justice and Public Order Act can only be used if activated by a superintendent and is only in affect for a 24 hour peroid. It can only be activated when the superintendent anticipates violence and usually is only used for large crowds such a football matches. especially derby matches. 
 
The more common search is under section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, where a constable can stop and search someone is he has reasonable grounds for suspicion (s1 (3)).  

reasonable grounds for suspicion is wide but must be based on accurate and current intelligence or information. Such as in the area you're in there has recently been a burglary or there has been alot of drug activity in the area recently. [2.4 of the code of practice A, linked below]   

Following this the police must follow the procedures set out in [Police Code of Practice A] (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/252256/2013_Code_A.pdf)
This sets out a number of dutys that police must perform while performing a stop and search such as; 

* If in plain dressed clothes the officer must show the warrant card
* inform the person and why their being detained
* Officers name
* How the search is going to be conducted 
* Must be given a report after the search detail the search, the officers name and why you was stopped
* They cannot target people simply because of their ethnicity, age, sex or sexual orientation 
etc

With regards to denying the stop and search this may amount to an arrest and you'll be searched at the police station against your will. Its best even if you feel they don't have reasonable suspicion is to say to the police at the time you don't think this amounts to reasonable suspicion but allow the search to continue then to complain to your local police authority with information including the officers name, badge number, why their searching you, time date and location. If the local police authority decided not to investigate pass the complaint onto the Independent Police Complaints Commission. 


With regards to defending yourself, depending on the damage inflicted on the officer this may amount to battery to assault, assuming you just push them off you.

&gt;So when Crespo arrived for training three days late, having made no contact with the club in the meantime, everybody was eager to see how the new manager would respond. No sooner than the recalcitrant Argentinian had arrived, Mourinho ordered him to his office, and it was time for the first of many Jose 'doses'.

&gt;The striker had barely begun to draw upon a laundry list of excuses when Mourinho turned around, raised his voice, and tore into the Argentinian, accusing him of feigning ignorance and showing a lack of professionalism. When Crespo pretended not to understand, the man who had for nine years earned his bread and butter as a translator immediately switched to the Argentinian's native Spanish and demanded to be told which language Crespo would like to receive the dressing down of his life in.

&gt;Exact versions of this story vary. One tells of the commotion from his office attracting the ears of everybody in adjoining rooms, with the players practicing downstairs dropping their balls and dumbbells, gathering by the wall, leaning in to pick up on every word of the pasting being delivered upstairs. Another mentions a staff member on cleaning duty walking down the corridor with his trolley, only to stop in his tracks upon seeing a pen-stand fly out of the manager's room and hit the opposite wall.

Maybe the gambling shops need to be slightly responsible for the gamblers. Perhaps the gamblers must prove they have sufficient money to gamble.

The criticism I see thrown at him from United supporters is often how I saw him at Everton:

* Archaic tactics with no real Plan B (long ball after long ball - ""hit the front man!"" was often the scream you'd hear from the touchline when our defence was looking to play the ball forward), this changed eventually to playing with wide players and banging crosses into the box with the middle of the park being more about stopping attacks than starting them.
* Sticks with 4-4-2 or 4-5-1 and doesn't seem to know how to use anything else.
* He was great in the transfer market and got us some fantastic players for peanuts, but he sure took his time, sometimes making us miss out on a player - earning him the nickname ""Dithering Dave"" amongst fans.
* Generally quite negative in all aspects of the game - would play with a defensive posture, would aim not to lose rather than to win (""let's just get out of there alive"" being the often cited quote), would talk down our chances of achievement and made sure everyone thought of us as the underdogs - even the players, I think.
* Had a negative affect on the prolific strikers that came to Everton - they often ended up netting fewer and fewer goals as their time with the club went on (Johnson, Yakubu, Jelavic).
* Would form close bonds with a few players and do whatever he could to accommodate them in the side regardless of there being better options on the bench (Phil Neville, Tony Hibbert, Leon Osman).
* Would leave it too late to make substitutions, and when he did they'd be questionable ones - like one defensive player for another when you're 1-0 down with 10 mins to go.

Some of this may be overly critical, and I'm sure not everyone agrees with me, but it's how I see things in hindsight. Personally I think him leaving has been a very good thing for us and Martinez is streets ahead of him tactically and in most other aspects.

I think this may be true for even many of the best flats.

I'm now living in my second flat, and in both I've had this experience, if a neighbour uses the toilet when I'm lying in bed ready to sleep.

Both of these flats were new builds in the 70's, I think. The latter is quite a decent ex-coucil flat, with quite a lot of storage - it has a walk-in wardrobe in the bedroom, and the the bedroom itself is large enough it could probably be divided into two singles.

I do agree with you, though - I've always thought that being able to hear your neighbour pee is quite symbolic of property poverty. That and being evicted because your landlord can make more money after redecorating.

I can hear my neighbour, too, when he raises his voice to yell at his daughter. He has a very distinctive sort of told-you-so tone which he uses when he's merely annoyed, but when he's pissed off you can hear every word. :(

When gambling becomes a problem on such a scale, it's not just the individual that's affected. More people spending more money on gambling machines means money potentially removed from other areas of the local economy, higher crime rates etc. - Social problems that spread out from beyond the scope of just the individual.

The argument of whether or not someone is making poor choices themselves, and that of personal responsibility becomes completely redundant. The fact is that people *are* making poor choices. And these people who are unable to control their own choices are finding it easier to make these poor choices because of these machines in betting shops.

&gt; but then if you have a group of people who are willing and even eager to hand over their cash to you - why not take advantage of that? Why not make it as easy as possible for them to do so?

true,falcon_jab,scottish,Scotland,"I suppose it starts to become a fairly philosophical argument about free will.

To what extent are our choices our own? I choose to get up every morning, go to work, come back, watch TV. How much of that is truly my ""choice"" though, and how much is it simply because that's the pattern of my life and that's what I'm accustomed to.

If I decided to get up one morning, stop doing my job, move to another country and do something different, I'd feel distinctly uncomfortable about that. Why? I don't know, it sounds like it might be quite exciting. But I don't want to do that. It doesn't fit with the pattern of my life.

Same with gambling. Someone who chucks all their money into a gambling machine ""chooses"" to do that, sure. But that's because the alternative is to ""not throw all their money into a gambling machine"", and to them, that's something that would make them feel uncomfortable and unhappy. They're seeking happiness. Short-lived, and damaging, sure. But most damaging addictions have that effect.

And where do you assign the blame? At the state level? Families, for not stopping him earlier? Himself, for not stopping earlier? How about blaming the muscles in his arms for lifting his hands to press the buttons? Or the neurons in his brain for faulty connections reinforced over years of poor decision making?

So the philosophical question is: To what extent are our choices are own when we're treading well worn paths laid down over the years?

If you don't close LHR, you will not be able to tempt enough carriers away from it.  Think you can have a 90m+ airport just down the road from LHR, hell no.  You'll be LGW size for ever.

The other reason for closing LHR is you'd make more money (in today's market) selling flats on the site.  Most of the argument comes from reducing noise on people so this makes sense.  Many airlines hate the restrictions on flight hours at LHR.

Do the same, in a more natural setting with someone who had a history of abuse, whose life chances and circumstances were shit, and they'd more likely than not become rapidly dependent and find it very hard to kick the habit.

Also, as I hinted at above, method of administration matters.  Heroin is ""sticky"", but it's far more sticky when you inject than if you smoke or snort it (people do snort smack sometimes!)  It also puts off a lot of people who try it once, because it often makes people puke - it takes a bit of stamina and application to get a habit.

So right now, Heathrow has two runways, that are a bit close together.  This makes it harder than many dual strip facilities.  But they get the flights in.  More than Luton+City+Stansted+Gatwick combined.  They also have noise issues.  They can't have many night slots.

So Boris Island could be 24/7.  Want to have the 3 mile stack at 1am?  No problem!  (3 miles is as close as you can line up).

People often think two runways means one for take off, one for landing, this isn't the case.  If a plane has a problem, they do a ""go around"" which is pilot speak for hit the fucking power to 11.  Obviously this is embarrassing and creates issues for the TC, but Asiana shows why you should do it if its not perfect.  Anyway.  The fact a pilot might need to do this means you always have things 'taking off' from any runway that has traffic, and plan as such.  LHRs runways are too close together, much less than half a nm.  Compare it to say Schipol, which has over 1.5nm between 00/36.  That means you can slam your planes about twice as close!

So even if they just built two runways there, if they spaced them further apart, had no noise restrictions, they would get a shitload more planes in.  Not to mention NATS job would be easier in many ways, as currently the holding patterns for LGW LCY LTN STN are rather fun!  (but the guys doing this have an awesome golden cock so you know you can trust them).

Also lets not forget, the plans include 6 runways, only 4 to be built initially.

Not to mention that even with easterlies it would free up holding air-space for LGW.  LGW could also ramp up its flights too potentially.

I guess I'm a fan of the idea, however, the devil is in the detail, the need for new motorway, new train links etc.  Not to mention the cost of the damned airport itself.  Makes me less in favour.

People link their spending to the value of their home; house price goes up a bit, remortgage and buy a new car, or redecorate, or go on holiday, or get a boob job.

This obviously means that they can't afford to sell their house at a lower price because they would be either in negative equity or only be able to afford a smaller/less desirable home because other vendors are in the same boat.

If you built 10,000 new homes in Kent tomorrow the value of existing houses would be affected to the tune of about 47 pence. We need to build more houses than we need before prices come down.

You just have to look at Ireland.

My Mum lives in an area with a population of around 15,000, of those 15,000 about 1,000 would be in the market (or about to be) for a new house.

true,forgottenoldusername,eng-manchester,It is indeed grim up north.,"The Guardian is honestly sometimes no better than the Daily Mail.
Nothing more than the other face of the coin.

Completely anecdotal, but I've only gambled twice in my life.
First was on a proper roulette table, put £10 down on 14, won.
Second time was on electronic roulette (which many say are rigged.), stuck a quid down on 14, won. 
I'm now terrified to ever gamble again. If, heaven forbid, I won again I know damn well know I'd end up blowing a fortune. 

Now I'm able to realise I would easily get addicted to that, it's for similar reasons that I don't do cocaine, for example. 
If I'm able to realise how easy addiction is to fall into for my self, why aren't others? And why society and these 'predatory' machines then take the blame?

Sure, addiction is a very real thing. Once addicted it's not easy to get out of that circle. I'm not at all saying that's not so.
But not everyone falls into addiction. And if people are so willing to spend money on these machines, you can't blame the man who put the machine in the room. If these people weren't blowing their money there, they'd do it elsewhere. Sure, it might take longer - but it would still be blown.

They know the machines are fixed to take in more than they give out, and so in the long term punters can only lose. Surely the punters know this too, but frequent big wins keep them hooked hoping they can beat the odds (this time), which is impossible in the end.

&gt; It seems pretty ruthless to design machines like that knowing that they will enslave the vulnerable, ruin their lives, break up marriages and impoverish their children, as well as increase crime in the local community (which will therefore increase the rates), etc. So, casino companies, expect to get run out of town!",1,1389185969,null,0,false,0,cekdyt5,t3_1upc5n,t1_cekdyt5,t1_cekdu7z,null,1431852110,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3

I was looking on the property websites at the selling prices for flats in his building as well as rents. One-bed flats were selling at around £140k with private rents in the building being around £600 unfurnished. Then I noticed something odd - a few of the flats had sold for less than £40k about four/five years ago (with one going for just £20k). It took me a while to figure out what was going on but then I realised that those sales must have been how much people bought them off the council/housing association for and that they've typically realised 350% on the purchase price in just a few years.

Right to buy must have provided a lot of capital from sales and rentals for people who were in a position to buy to move into the buy to let market.

So they do it, and time passes, and another bushy-tailed MBA comes along, and does another study, and concludes that removing another five sesame seeds wouldn't hurt either, and would save even more money, and so on and so forth, every year or two, the new management trainee looking for ways to save money proposes removing a sesame seed or two, until eventually, they're shipping hamburger buns with exactly three sesame seeds artfully arranged in a triangle, and nobody buys their hamburgers any more.

The problem is, in the UK there isn't an alternative because everyone is making their burgers that way.

Its harder to find figures but this (http://www.drugscope.org.uk/resources/faqs/faqpages/how-many-people-use-drugs) reckons that 5 million people have tried class As. So we can take that as an upper limit on the number of people who have tried crack or heroin.  But its not clear how much lower that figure is. I expect powder cocaine accounts for quite a bit of that so the actual figure is probably a lot lower.

According to this article (http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/apr/06/grand-national-betting-record-total) there is an estimate that 1/4 of the adult population will have bet on the 2013 grand national - roughly 10 million maybe. So we can expect the total number of people to have ever tried gambling to be higher than this.

Anyway I'm down to estimates on estimates now so I'm not going to get anything useful out of this exercise!

Cambridge is an itty-bitty city; diameter is about 6 miles.  The bus services are... OK (The C1 is the most useful bus), not brilliant though (probably a lot better than most buses in the US though).  Attempting to drive within central Cambridge is a bit daft really - it's very busy, lots of one-way streets, enormously expensive parking, blech.  Cycling is a popular way to get around; and it's reasonably well catered to.  But if you live further out then driving in becomes a more sensible thing!  And if you work outside the center then there's a better chance you will be able to park.

Cambridge is a lot warmer than North American places at the same latitude; but correspondingly has a *lot less daylight* in winter than North American places that have similar temperatures.  We don't get much rain, almost no snow (maybe 1 week/year), and no really ""extreme"" weather.

The worstest thing is the price of houses; and the rather dreary fenland scenery (on the upside the flatness makes cycling easier!)

Last train back from London usually about midnight; which is a bit naff if you want to have an evening out in London; fast train ~50mins; tickets ~25 quid return.

Housing - don't limit yourself to flats, look at small houses too (unless you really want a flat!  the prices overlap).  Don't live on the flood plain (anything with a ""river view""...).  Nowhere in Cambridge is really ""bad"", North Cambridge is cheaper (and less nice); a lot of the pricing variation is due to school catchments (if you don't have children you don't care) and proximity to the station (if you aren't commuting by train you probably don't care).  Letting agents are all really annoying :(  Buying is painfully expensive.

true,vonbond,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxford,"I don't really know where to start in answering this question, but I will list a few things and some sources to give you a flavour of *why* green spaces and parks are so important in urban areas.

Environmental concerns:

these include, but are not in any way limited to:

* improving air quality - this is what trees do all day long, every day. I think it would be patronising to expand upon this point.
* reduction of flooding (and likelihood of flooding). All that concrete, tarmac, and urban construction leaves no where absorbent for rainwater run off to. The water goes to the only place it can, down, and stays there. This is not good for houses or businesses. Parks counteract this by providing a large surface area to store and filter nasty polluted rainwater in urban areas. I cannot state this clearly enough: if you build on those green areas, there WILL BE more flooding. For everyone. Not just those houses on the park-as-was.
* wildlife and and habitats: especially in London (I don't know a lot about parks in, say, Singapore or Beijing, for example) parks provide much-needed habitat for animals and wildlife in the area. Cities aren't just about people.

Having just said that....

* green spaces have something incredible like a 95% approval rating. They attract millions of visitors a year- both tourists AND locals.
* sports: natural facilities for cardio (e.g. running and walking) and spaces for informal sports like kick about with your friends.
* stress reduction: it's a lot easier to be less stressed at work if you have somewhere to *go* for a break that is a pleasant and contrasting environment to the office, for example.

Those are just the obvious reasons. There are other things that mean that building on the green areas in London would be impossible. The most obvious reason that comes to mind is that most of it is owned by the Crown. It's not ours for building on. Where it's not owned by Her Maj, they are common spaces owned by everyone. So no building there either. 

Those things I have mentioned above are all verifiable. I have a link at the bottom so you can read for yourself. 

These are my opinions:

Space is a big deal in London. Space is maybe an even bigger deal in London because people live in sometimes pretty shitty and cramped conditions. The outside areas that people inhabit ameliorate the crampedness of their homes. No garden? Oh, that's fine, I have 1.5 acres of community garden on my doorstep. No garden for growing veg? Oh that's ok too, my community park has allotments. 

The problem with the green spaces in London is not about inefficient use of space to solve the housing crisis. The problem with the green spaces in London is actually that they make it an attractive city to live in. People WANT to be there because it's nice (amongst other things, like, you know, jobs). This leads to housing shortages. We need to focus on making other
areas in the country more attractive for people to live and work in. 

Families on housing benefit in the capital put politicians in a precarious position, I agree. I don't have an answer for that, I'm afraid. 

TL;DR: green spaces are important in London because they prevent flooding and pollution, and keep people, animals and plants happy.

Looking back through /r/unitedkingdom there is a steady cavalcade of stories:

Nov 2013

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25145362
&gt;The Nationwide building society said house prices are now rising at 6.5% a year, up from 5.8% a month ago.
&gt;It said the average price of a house or flat in the UK is £174,566, the highest since April 2008.

http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/28/bank-england-fls-mortgages-house-prices
&gt;The governor of the Bank of England on Thursday reined in the mortgage market as he sought to prevent five years of ultra-low interest rates and George Osborne's Help to Buy scheme from fuelling a pre-election housing bubble.

October 2013

Mild counterpoint:http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24707577
&gt;House prices are only rising modestly in England and Wales, figures from the Land Registry suggest.
&gt;Its latest index shows that prices rose by 3.4% in the year to September, a little faster than general inflation.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24533059
&gt;In August, the ONS's house price index stood at 185.8, surpassing its previous peak of 185.5 in January 2008.

&gt;The average price of a house or flat in the UK is now £247,000, the ONS said, the highest figure since the index was first calculated in 1968.
&gt;The figures suggest house prices are rising in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but still falling in Scotland.

September 2013:

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24060130
&gt;Bank of England governor Mark Carney has told MPs ""we do need to be vigilant"" on house prices.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23983828
&gt;UK house prices 'rise at fastest rate since 2010'
&gt;UK house prices have risen by 5.4% in the year to August, according to the Halifax's latest house price survey.
&gt;It is the highest annual rate since June 2010.
&gt;On the Halifax's measure, the average price of a house also went through the £170,000 mark for the first time in five years.
&gt;However, the figures are still well below the peak of the market in August 2007, when the average price was almost £200,000.

Earlier in the year in July 2013:

http://www.independent.co.uk/property/uk-house-prices-could-rise-18-in-next-five-years-8720701.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter

&gt;UK house prices should rise by an average of 18.1 per cent by the end of 2017, say Savills.
&gt;Revising their forecasts six months ago, Savills believe that average prices will increase by 3.5 per cent this year - their earlier original forecast was 0.5 per cent. At these levels of growth, the UK average house price will beat its 2007 peak in 2015.

TLDR:

1) Big names in the BOE are worried and taking measures specifically against a housing bubble.

2) An accelerating trend of house price growth towards the end of the year, with a lot of it in the last couple of months.

true,falcon_jab,scottish,Scotland,"&gt; I'm not sure it works that way though - I'd say that not putting money in the machine simply results in... nothing. Nothing changes. But the high is from doing it and maybe winning.

It's interesting that you say that.

I have no idea myself about the physiological nature of addiction - but to me it seems almost self-evident that there is a ""negative"" aspect to it.

It's not just a case of ""I want to do *this*, because it makes me happier"", there's also ""Not doing *this* makes me unhappy"" - especially if you're near or around triggers for that specific activity.

Take the internet, for example. Or Reddit. I spend a fair amount of time on here. (Maybe too much, who knows. It doesn't exactly cause problems in my personal or work life) - When I'm randomly browsing around on the net, there's that vague sort of ""Hmm, internet. Internet is nice"" feeling.

When I'm not using the internet, it's not exactly like my mind is screaming out ""Must use internet!"", but if I suddenly have a thought about something I want to post on Reddit, or something I want to Google (say someone asks me how much water goes over Niagara Falls in one minute, my brain instantly thinks ""Internet! Need internet! Must know!"") - if I don't do that, there's... not sure how to describe it, but it's like an itch. A nagging little brain itch that makes me feel that *not getting internet* is making me unhappy. Internet is the way to solve not having internet. So I might seek out internet.

(I mean, we're taught *every single day* via ads, peer pressure, social expectations etc. that we should *seek happiness* - it's the most important thing there is! We should buy products that make us happy. We should earn more money, that makes us happy too. Buy more things! Get happier!)

It's not exactly something I can't whisk away with a bit of thought though - a minute later I'm easily distracted by something else - but I can imagine for some people that ""itch"" is more persistent. And especially if you factor in a person's social life - or lack thereof, if they have *nothing else to distract them*, then that itch is all they're going to think about.

I can easily distract myself with work, family, computer games, cooking a stew, yadda yadda - interests, hobbies, education all help. I sometimes wonder, if I didn't have all that, and only had *Internet, delicious internet*, how much harder it would be to resist.

&gt; You do make a good point that there are other factors - perhaps he's behind on his rent and winning the machines could put him back in the black again. Perhaps it's his daughters birthday and he hasn't the money for the gift she wants.

Again, it's interesting - you're assuming there that the only motivation someone might have for continuing to gamble is purely monetary, i.e. that they could easily say ""Actually, no. I'm going to stop now. I'll get the money some other way, perhaps"".

I'd argue that in a true capitalist society you absolutely can change an economic entity with fines or taxes because prices are set by supply and demand.  In fact, even in this neo-con capitalist society the same is true (look at how many car manufacturers matched the Governtment scappage scheme when it was introduced to compete).

Most industries these days do price testing - they'll know the exact price that people are willing to pay to maximise their profit.

IMO, before Lloris came to Spurs he was easily one of the top 5 keepers in the world, and I am in no way saying he has been a failure or a disappointment, I love that we brought him here. However, the English game is very different to the French one and he needs some time to adjust. Taking Lukaku's knee to his face hasn't helped, and I think since that injury he has been a little sketchy. Excellent shot-stopping, but sometimes he's a bit too eager to come out of his area and I get flash-backs of Gomes. Sometimes he punches when he should catch, etc. He doesn't look great and clearing out or claiming from a crowded box, which happens a lot in the premier league.

It was ten years ago and It was a new guy being ""puppywalked"" by an older copper. I was a motorcycle courier parked on Carnaby St with my numberplate obscured by a newspaper (to avoid a £100+ fine from parking attendants trying to work their way to a flatscreen TV). He marched over unceremoniously with his notebook already out writing a ticket. He told me that I was committing a crime by obscuring the numberplate.

I was just one person out of a huge row of couriers doing exactly the same thing, clearly picked arbitrarily to practice writing tickets. I was extremely annoyed and remonstrated with them, the older guy, unbelievably, wanted me to ""play along"" and let him ""write his ticket"". I would be fucked if he was, I'd removed the paper and there was no crime being committed, nor any evidence of one. I'd cooperated but there was no leeway, because I had to assist in the training of a new police officer by being fined and fucked over.

I lost my temper, was warned not to swear, then said ""For fuck's sake"" and the next thing I knew there was a van there. I was bundled into the back and spent a few hours in a cell in Saville Row Police station, where I got some nice sponge cake and a tea. On the way out I was given a statement that was basically bollocks, to sign. It was riddled with inaccuracies, making the younger copper look good and me look like a maniac, with the sergeant pretty much blackmailing me into signing.

Tactics, players and schemes were discussed in there. 

As far as discontinuation of the boot room, the hiring of Souness would have had something to do with it although I'm not sure what his coaching staff was or his link to the boot room itself, but once Evans was manager he sought to bring about a return to traditions with the boot room but then when Houllier came in it was a different time and a step away from the old traditions, which was much needed by then.

They begin to think they're owed a win soon and that mentality is how people get utterly hooked.

To be honest this is the fundamental issue with advertising. Giving it the benefit of the doubt it exists to inform, but I think in reality it exists to obfuscate and mislead. No sane promoter would advertise the negative consequences of their product, but without full information about the costs and benefits its not possible to weigh them up and make an informed decision. (The efficient market hypothesis in economics assumes among other things that all participants have access to complete information).

I don't see how its possible to have a form of advertising that doesn't minimise the negatives and maximise the positives unless it made exactly no claims about a product. For example, food adverts wouldn't even be able to show a picture of the food they're advertising. So it would be a logo and not much else. For gambling that might be a picture of the william hill logo and not much else!

Thanks, I've worked hard on it ;)

&gt;The DMS 5 categorising gambling as an addiction and not a simple matter of impulse control which you seem to think it is.

I was not aware. Actually pretty interesting, I'll look into it.

&gt;Washing your hands of it and saying ""people should be as clever as me"" is both ignorant and arrogant to the extreme.

I wasn't suggesting that. 
I didn't say it was a matter of intelligence and as I've said I wasn't aware of the previous quoted bit. My question 'Why aren't others?' does come across like that though, my apologies. I did actually intend that as a serious question though, and I was hoping someone would answer it which you have now done, thank you. 

Perhaps seriously limiting the max bet would be my solution, but like I said people will just go else where, or take more time blowing their winnings. 
I will definitely look into gambling addictions more, there is clearly more to it than I thought. 

Again, my apologise. I didn't come across well and that wasn't intended at all!

Highlights:
&gt; The best support for genetic contributions to PG (pathological gambling) and SUDs (substance use disorder) come from studies of the Vietnam Era Twin Registry [73]. These studies indicate heritable contributions to PG [74] and shared environmental and genetic contributions to PG and alcohol dependence [75] and PG and antisocial behaviors [76]. These findings are similar to those suggesting common genetic contributions to a range of drug use disorders [77].

&gt;Molecular genetic studies have suggested similarities between PG and SUDs. For example, the D2A1 allele of the D2 dopamine receptor gene (DRD2) has been reported to increase in frequency from non-addicted to PG and co-occurring PG and SUD groups [78]. Similarly, the gene has been implicated in PG with and without SUDs [79]. More conclusive data from genome-wide studies are emerging and similarly implicate genes in PG and SUDs [80]. As genetic factors have been associated with positive outcome for treatment of SUDs [81], genetic sampling should be considered in treatment trials in PG and other ICDs (impulse control disorder).

&gt; Multiple transmitter systems have been similarly implicated in ICDs and SUDs [8,54]. Many biochemical similarities involving serotonin systems have been observed across disorders linked by impaired impulse control. Low levels of the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxy-indole-acetic acid have been found in the cerebrospinal fluids of individuals with PG and alcoholism [54]. Levels of platelet monoamine oxidase, considered a peripheral marker of serotonin function, are decreased in subjects with PG, and similar findings have been observed in individuals with SUDs and behaviors characterized by impaired impulse control [54].

&gt; Behavioral responses to the partial serotonin 5HT1/5HT2 agonist meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP) have been found to distinguish individuals with impaired impulse control, including those with PG and alcohol abuse/dependence, from those without [54].

TL;DR: Propensity to pathological gambling is heritable, and biochemically similar to the mechanisms predisposing to substance abuse and risk of drug addiction.",0,1389190926,null,0,false,0,cekf5mh,t3_1upc5n,t1_cekf5mh,t1_cekey86,null,1431852634,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

If your dream is to play Football, I'd say those types of people at minimum would be playing weekly with their mates on a grass pitch or be playing in a Sunday League, mainly 5v5. If you've never played a game of football, then why would your dream be playing with the World's Best? It makes no sense.

Could someone at the age of 23 become a Pro Football player with zero pitch experience? I think with the physical abilities and an eye for the game it's very possible if you're able to get the right sort of training around you. If you're not very agile, have a tendency to get injured and need to work to live, then it's never going to happen, but if not, there's always a chance.

As I like to think, if you've never tried, you'll never know, there could be someone playing in a 5 aside team that could rival Jack Wilshere, but due to them working and never being scouted, they'll never be Pro.

I'm aiming to become an Athlete, and I'm not 18 anymore, but for the last 2 years I've been training most days of the week, it's what someone does when they want something. If I was sitting here thinking ""I wish I was an Athlete"" but I don't train, I'm just living a silly dream that's never going to be a reality.

There are 3 current fighters that within the next 2 years will probably become World Champions. 5 years ago, they had never fought or trained in their entire lives, and if we saw them 5 years ago, and they told us they'd be fighting for the Belt within 5 years, we'd be laughing at them, but it became a reality.

The harshness against Late Bloomers is mainly jealousy or ignorance, I've seen it my whole life, and you hear it from those very people that are now Professional, many many Athletes are told they would never become Pro, but they ignore those who doubt them and push through it.

At the end of the day, if it was easy, everyone would be Athletes, but it takes a certain type of person to go against the masses, and actually try.

I read a long term study a few years ago that suggests the average property value in the UK was about 14 years worth of rent. 

The property boom in the last 15 years was primary down to availability of credit, not increases in wages, not immigration, not a baby boom. Sure others did have an impact, but it was marginal compared to the credit boom.

Slandering the right is normally morally right.

The right are preoccupied with fear, hate and selfishness usually - and it is always parties of the right wing that want to interfere in people's personal/sex/love lives - usually due to either hate or religion (or both)

It is Tory mp's for example that wanted to prevent homosexual marriage (state invloved in your love lives) , it is Tory mp's that want to prevent women's right to abortion. It is Tory mp's who want to prevent the right to having a spare room if your poor, etc.

Its not just here - in America parts of the GOP want to state to directly interfere in adults sex lives (again the right wing imposing the state against people's private lives)

On the contrary, BYOD is a great idea when done right - especially for young IT users.

&gt;How do you standardize so that users are all on the same software versions ?

By only supporting a minimum version of the app to connect to your services.

&gt;How do you make sure all users have anti-virus and malware protection ?

You can deploy apps which check for the existence of your insisted solution. Or you just don't - and rely on your app(s) to be sufficently sandboxed to not worry about the software on the rest of the system.

&gt;What about support, do you do it in house (which your techs will HATE), or do you leave it up to the users so it costs them money to do their job ?

That depends on the organisation, obviously. But your techs support a limited number of systems which an employee must agree to use one of. You also have redundant systems for staff to use in the event of failure.

What you're proposing is to seriously harm the poorest people who have to rent.

&gt; I read a long term study a few years ago that suggests the average property value in the UK was about 14 years worth of rent. 

Sounds about right.  Add on management fees, cost of maintaining the house, cost of changing between tenants, and so on, and you're looking at closer to 20 years.

This works out at about 3.6% annual interest for the landlord - very close to the interest that he'd be paying for the mortgage. (1.036^20 = 2)

So as it is, landlords are pretty close to breaking even, without making any money.

That's a good point about wooden housing though, I have no idea,, I found this though:

&gt;Most very old houses are made of local materials. The stone then blends nicely into the landscape. Some are half timbered and are built from wattle and daub with a thatched roof. 

&gt;Bricks baked from clay have been used since Roman times but it was the Industrial Revolution that made them the most common house building material. Since then, most British houses have been constructed of bricks.

It is basically that in the past they were made from local materials and we have more quarries than forests. And as planning permission requires buildings to fit in then it becomes self-propagating, also most people's vision of a desirable house in Britain is a brick house so they would think of wood as inferior despite the fact it can actually be a better insulator and far cheaper etc. and can exploit modern prefab techniques as you mentioned.",0,1389194184,null,0,false,0,cekg7n0,t3_1upb4t,t1_cekg7n0,t1_cekfdcm,null,1431853196,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Corporation tax is 20-24% (depending on company size), so assuming that the mortgage is 50-75% of the rent (guess based on 80% loan to value and a bit of capital gains), then the additional tax would be 10-20% on top the rent. This would be passed on to renters.

The price drop is more difficult to gauge. In the long run increased rents would reduce demand for rental properties, in turn pushing down house prices. This would be somewhat offset by increased rents pushing renters into buying houses sooner, driving prices back up. I don't have any figures for the proportion of uk properties owned by companies, but would guess less than half. Simplistically, that would imply less than half of house buyers have 10-20% less to spend, so a 5-10% drop in house prices.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"There are a number of problems that have caused this:

 - The UK quirk of measuring house sizes in ""bedrooms"".  That means the developers would rather put extra rooms in than bigger rooms -- to be classed as a bedroom they have to be able to take a bed, that's all.  I've seen houses were a room classed as a ""bedroom"", were it to have a single bed in it, the door would not open.

 - Lack of planning permission.  Developers buy an area and are given permission to build on it.  They will get more money by building two tiny houses than one large house.  It's inevitable if you give permission for housing on a ""zone"" basis.  ""This is a residential zone"" means that the developer's only option is to cram as many houses in that area as they can (and therefore that's what they propose and get permission for).  Those people who buy a plot of land in the middle of the country and ask to build their dream home on it are in for a long, hard haul.  The UK has massive available area, that wouldn't be damaged by builder/occupier homes; but it's not being used.  Hence the value of the limited urban areas goes up.

 - Unwillingness to build/grant permission for large apartment blocks.  The disasters that were created in the 60s is no reason why apartments can't be nice pleasant homes.  There are a few appearing in old buildings that have been bought out in old cities.  They're nice.  But you have to ask why the developers are doing this with these large old buildings, and why there are far fewer new, quality blocks being built.

In the end it's supply and demand.  Land with planning permission is an artificially (relative to how much the UK has) supply limited resource.  The inevitable result: shortage.  It's happened everywhere that governments have limited the supply of anything, throughout all time.  It's not a surprise, and the fix is obvious.

Politicians own a lot of property; so equally unsurprising is their willingness to do anything about the problem.

Edit: I meant to offer a solution.  It's a dual solution in that it raises money for the state too.  Since the state can turn £5,000 an acre arable land into £500,000 an acre land with a stroke of a pen (planning permission representing about 80% of the value of a property), then they should relax planning laws, but start selling the permissions.  They should also, incidentally, stop selling off public housing to the tennants, who then sell on to a BTL landlord for a windfall profit who then rent the same property back to the state at higher cost than they were paying when they owned it.",0,1389195621,null,0,1389197190,0,cekgqg6,t3_1upb4t,t1_cekgqg6,t3_1upb4t,null,1431853466,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

true,davewi11o,null,null,"As has been mentioned below, the boot room was actually a physical boot room, literally a small cupboard like room where players boots were hung up. Shanks and co would sit in there after games and invite the opposition manager in for a drink, then they would fill them with booze and get all types of information out of them on players, tactics and so on. 

This room was also used by the management to sit and talk with each other about the game for hours on end. (Don't forget, this was before the days of endless analysis on TV, sky sports in depth coverage, the internet and twitter, so gathering information on rivals tactics, setup and players was a lot tougher to find than it is now.)

The boot room was eventually demolished due to refurbishment in the stadium, but by then its magic was long gone. The idea of promoting from within was spoiled by Souness, who tried to change too much, too quickly and made a top side into a standard side pretty fast. Roy Evans then restored a little dignity back to the club, but as Man Utd, Arsenal and the rest got stronger, Liverpool's inconsistency saw them falling behind. The introduction of Houllier was much needed at the time to inject a new purpose into the club, and although GH never won the league, he can be thanked for introducing a number of things to the club which increased professionalism and brought LFC into the 21st Century. Sadly however, one of the downsides of a foreign manager was that the heart of the club was lost due to the introduction of the first manager since Shanks to be brought in from ""outside"" the club.

However, the magic of the bootroom wasnt to be found in the room itself, it was more to do with the philosophies of the guys who sat in there. In modern day football this would be hard to recreate as the game has moved on so much but it would be a lovely touch for the club to reinstate it, even just to show off on stadium tours etc.",0,1389195633,null,0,false,0,cekgqlm,t3_1upgzk,t1_cekgqlm,t3_1upgzk,null,1431853467,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

What you're proposing is to seriously harm the poorest people who have to rent.

Yes, some people will have to suffer even more. Currently there are people who are so cut back the only way the BTL market can manage is the state/local council subsidising the private landlord industry.

The reason why it's harder now for people to make money from BTL is because the low lending rates and tax relief on interest payments have been priced into the cost. People still buy because they don't think they will make money on running a BTL but on the asset price increase of the property. It's like buying a Facebook share because you think it will go up in value, not because the company makes any money. The irony is that the only way for rents to go up is if wages go up, of that happens interest rates should go up (don't think that the state will do all kinds of economics magic to stop this from happening). If rents go up without wages, expect consumer spending to grind to a halt.

People are already suffering, and many way past giving up things to pay the rent. I know people who are going without. The problem is that these people know that they're not middle class or aspiring middle class. Therefore no one in the political class is looking for their vote, either in policy or message.

Ah /u/Wasp-ish , do you have a shortcut on your keyboard for 'lefties', seeing how often you write it?

&gt; Perhaps the rise in racist bullying is to do with the rise in the number of Muslims in recent years?

According to the [2011 census](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_the_United_Kingdom#Demography_and_ethnic_background), there are 2.869 million Muslims living in the UK, which is a 179% increase on 2001. ChildLine reports that calls about racism have increased by 69% in the last year. So, unless the amount of Muslims increased by 69% in the last year, which, judging by the statistics, they haven't, it has little to do with an increasing Muslim population.

&gt; Maybe it's something to do with, y'know, the Muslim terrorists? 

Probably, yeah. That doesn't excuse it though. Should I be allowed to bully Catholic and Irish kids at school because of the IRA? No, I shouldn't. Just because a very small minority of Muslims feel the need to commit terrorists attacks, we shouldn't excuse bullying of Muslim children.

&gt; And since when is immigration now a far right issue?

Since, in the UK, the main two parties proposing the most radical anti-immigration measures are UKIP and the Tories, who are also the most right wing main parties. 

&gt; Maybe if Labour hadn't brought in a ton of immigrants to 'rub the rights nose in it' this wouldn't be the case? 

Yes, that's exactly what Labour were doing...

You are the bloody idiot. Sorry you are. You do know that people have been trying to ban or pressure the Sun from removing page 3 for years because they say that they don't want to see a naked woman when they want to read their particular newspaper? Argument sound familiar?

I will never be convinced that merely *looking at something* should cause so much offence to the onlooker that the act should be criminalised or even marginalised - just bloody look away.

Look lets be honest you either have a personal problem with nudity or want to defend others that have a problem with it on their behalf. Else why would you specifically bring up nudity? This is the core of the issue that you have dodged all alone. You dont want to be forced to see it on the street - but there are many things that people do in public that apparently don't bother you at all when out and about. Why objectively is this worse? Other than a stuffy attitude about the human body; a body we all bloody have. 

&gt;You see what you want and that's all that matters - you're incapable of considering that others might feel differently and that in forcing your way of doing things on others, you take away all their choices.

What the fuck? No it is **you** that have this opinion. I understand you don't want to look at something I really do. What you don't understand is that all you have to do to not look at something is look away! You are the one supporting legislation against someone else to take away their choices because you feel uncomfortable.

Nevermind, I am done. I am not trying to change your point of view. Merely suggesting to you that your argument is just *your* opinion.

The nuclear powered engine also acted as a secondary weapon for the missile as it gave off direct neutron radiation from the virtually unshielded reactor which would sicken, injure, and/or kill living things beneath the flight path; the stream of fallout left in its wake would poison enemy territory; and its strategically selected crash site would receive intense radioactive contamination.

If you try to stand in the other blocks of the Kop, or anywhere else in the ground the stewards will no doubt try to get you to sit in your seat.

Sometimes if me and my mates are in one of the 300 blocks standing, and another is somewhere else being forced to sit, we'll let them know our seat number and huddle up so we can all stand together.

If there is a big match on however (against the Mancs, blueshite (Everton) etc, a big cup game or a Champions League game, then usually the whole of the Kop stands.

true,practically_floored,newcr-1,,"He'll struggle with that money also because he's got no experience in having that sort of money at his disposal when it comes to transfers. One of Moyes' greatest strengths was finding a hidden gem that would be able to compete with the best in a few years, but at United he's expected to find players that will have an immediate impact on the team, and it's getting to the point where that is not only wanted but also needed from him. No one's going to be thanking him for finding great investment players when United finish outside the top 4.

What's more, his only addition is Fellaini, who's massive price has put immense pressure on him which he is not living up to. This in turn puts pressure on Moyes - what's better, no signings in January or overpaying for another player that may or may not deliver? 

What's even worse for Moyes is that he's competing against his old club, which at this moment in time is doing better. This adds a whole other level of criticism - ""Moyes was holding Everton back"" is not something I imagine he anticipated being thrown around when he accepted the United job.

Moyes does need time to get the club the way he wants it, and I think he has a chance of being successful there, but honestly I don't think many Evertonians would have expected him to ever get a more high profile job than Everton. He has never won anything at Everton and in the last few years there has been a shift in the support for Moyes, and perhaps a growing feeling that Everton may have outgrown his defensive style of play, and should be more ambitious than he was allowing them to be.

Obviously Moyes knows what is expected of him at United and therefore ambition doesn't really come into it, when he is expected to win trophies it's not about either aiming for the best or accepting mediocrity any more. Why this does matter is because winning requires a winning mentality, and I think that is one thing that Moyes just doesn't have. I feel like Everton under Moyes thrived on being the underdog, but this is not something he can use at United. He doesn't give the players the confidence and belief that they can win, and without that you're fighting a losing battle before the game has even started. I think this is also the reason that on a few occasions United have seemingly given up in the last 10 minutes when they are a goal down, they need that belief that the goal will come and I don't think Moyes is the person to give them that. 

In my opinion his appointment as manager was a needless gamble for United, I don't see Moyes as a strong enough leader to take the highest job there and I don't really understand what he has done as a manager to merit such a high profile job. However, given a few seasons he may well adapt to life there, change his outlook and be able to use the skills he does have to benefit the club while also learning to be a manager at the highest level. Fergie obviously saw something in him, because it's not like he would have had little choice for his replacement.",0,1389200299,null,0,1389200829,0,cekin9p,t3_1uoldy,t1_cekin9p,t1_cekddpi,null,1431854345,3,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,3

His reply:

&gt;Because you deny the truth it's clear what you are. He was unarmed - fact. The police failed to properly gather intelligence to if he was armed - fact. The only civilian witness says he was surrendering - fact. The police involved lied about the events - fact. The police involved have a history of lying about these incidents - fact.

And there is the point being made. A studio flat in Brighton starts at about £120ish and most of the houses I've seen at that are retirement places. 

For me and the boyfriend to get a [2 bed flat](http://www.zoopla.co.uk/market/east-sussex/brighton/?q=Brighton%2C%20East%20Sussex&amp;search_source=nav) we'll probably need a combined income of around 60k to get looked at. Sure, not impossible but to afford a below average flat we'll both need to earn above average salaries. 

While we can get somewhere outside of Brighton for less, it does rather highlight the issue.

&gt; When Duggan was shot, Detective Superintendent Mark Welton was the lead for the Met on post-firearms procedures: put simply, what happens after an officer opens fire. He said from the commissioner down, there was a view change was needed: ""You can't have a process the cops are confident in and the people of London are not. You are trying to defend something nobody else likes apart from yourself. These processes do not support the officers or make them appear truthful witnesses. I'm not surprised the family and the public don't like it, as it is administered by the police.""

&gt; The Duggan family have lost confidence in the IPCC. Among some officers, the ineffectiveness of the IPCC and the belief it does not command sufficient public trust, is seen as a burden on the police's reputation. Welton was diplomatic: ""We need to work with the IPCC in enabling them to investigate in a fashion that is independent and effective.

The term ""regeneration"" and ""incarnation"" are often used interchangeably, although they mean two different things. ""Regeneration"" is the process by which a Time Lord recovers from injury or other damage. ""Incarnation"" is the body that the Doctor inhabits. By Time Lord law, a Time Lord may only have twelve regenerations, for a total of thirteen incarnations.

Except, of course, that this can be changed. The Doctor has had far more than thirteen incarnations already when you count The War Doctor, the Valeyard, the (arguably) Dream Lord, and so on. And we see the Time Lords granting the Doctor and the Master additional regenerations at their discretion. In fact, at one point in an episode of the Sarah Jane Adventures, the Eleventh Doctor (thirteenth incarnation) states that he can regenerate five hundred and seven times, although some argue the canonical validity of this statement.

The fact that so much of this is left unanswered has become a bit of an arguing point among fans. ",0,1389202380,null,0,false,0,cekjk18,t3_1uq101,t1_cekjk18,t3_1uq101,null,1431854803,9,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,9

I do too, but I don't agree with your solutions as they harm individual freedoms rather than maximise them.

&gt; For example, I don't think its acceptable for companies to use advertising to influence people into vices and profit out of it.

You seem to want a free society as long as it holds to your moral system. That is not how I envision a functioning free society working based on individual liberty and i doubt there's any empirical evidence for it either. A free society is not free if it works from the premise of there being some kind of objective truth for morality that holds for the whole of society.

for example - I have enjoyed gambling in the past and if companies are not free to advertise their service to me then you are preventing free association solely based on your values. It is not in my interest to ban and tax gambling and doing so restricts my freedoms.

&gt; I support people who wish to smoke, but there must be sufficient tax levied either at the point of purchase or on tobacco companies' profits to cover the cost to society of the harm to health.

How do you measure that cost? I would agree there could be some cost associated to air pollution, but I don't see how there could ever be some objective measure for the cost on society and again don't agree with interfering with other people's lives, it hinders individual liberties. 

There is good evidence to show eating wheat is highly correlated to ill health - autoimmune diseases, dementia etc. Should there be a ban on wheat too?

Here is the guidance that the jury were given:

Any person is entitled to use reasonable force to defend himself or another from injury, attack or threat of attack. If V53 may have been defending himself or one of his colleagues then go on to consider two matters:

Did V53 honestly believe or may he honestly have believed, even if that belief is mistaken, that at the time he fired the fatal shot, that he needed to use force to defend himself or another; if your answer is NO then he cannot have been acting in lawful self defence and you can put that issue to one side; if your answer is YES then go on to consider:

Was the force used – the fatal shot – reasonable in all the circumstances? Obviously if someone is under attack from someone he genuinely believes is violent and armed – then that person cannot be expected to weigh up precisely the amount of force needed to prevent that attack. But if he goes over top and acts out of proportion to the threat then he would not be using reasonable force and his action would be unlawful.

Would also note that there were reports last week that the total value of the MUFC's share price has gone from £1.7bn to £1.5bn in the last month or so, and they're still not completely out the running for qualifying.

Tip: A good barber will usually have a manly moustache or beard.  Be wary of clean shaven barbers.

If £10 is insufficient funds, then you have clearly wandered into a ladies' ""hair dresser"".  Inform them that placing a barber's pole on the outside of their shop is misleading and confusing, and then excuse yourself post-haste.

Appropriate topics of conversation during the haircut are:
1- football

If none of these topics suit, you should sit in absolute silence.

The barber will signal that the haircut is over by showing you the back of your head for some reason.  They don't get out much so humour them.  The appropriate response is ""that's great. thanks"".

You may now leave.

Societies have always made legal exemptions that allow killing and even your communist utopia will have one.

Belief is important because unfortunately there is no way to be absolutely certain. Say a man is beating a woman severely and she is able to get hold of a kitchen knife and swing it into his neck and kill him. That would be considered a lawful killing but we have no way of knowing whether or not that man would have stopped beating her.

Say Duggan had infact pointed a gun at the officers but it turned out to be a replica. Would the police have been I the wrong for shooting him? How are they to determine certainty in such a scenario?

A jury of peers concluded that the officer in question genuinely believed he and his colleagues were about to be shot. In such a situation the officer would have had a moral duty to protect himself and others.

1) Cutting teeth - Criminal work isn't some sort of apprenticeship before you move onto another area of law. Criminal work and family work is a specialty, one which once you become experienced in, you generally stay in. Those who start practice in legal aid work will generally stay there. Those commercial barristers in your cited article will have started out as commercial barristers.

2) Other professions - Well, [the NHS begs to differ](http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/explore-by-career/doctors/pay-for-doctors/) because whilst their starting absolute minimum is £22k, compared to £12k for barristers, it jumps to £28k after a year. That's guaranteed, employed income, paid to you each month, not dribs and drabs of £50.00 prised out of the legal aid fund after months of chasing. Bear in mind also that £22k is the absolute minimum, and it jumps quickly. That £27k for barristers is the average. The average for a career that many people stay into until they are 70+ (largely because they can't afford to retire, and often because they are simply passionate about their job).

3) Your anecdotal experience - I won't comment much on the figure, since I don't know it was. However, did you have to incur up to [£18k](http://www.law.ac.uk/postgraduate/postgraduate-course-fees) of post-graduate (that's not counting your undergrad degree and possible conversion course, and living expenses) debt? Also, the point I made before is that there aren't that great rewards to come later. And perhaps most conclusively, your wages were set by your employer, there was no greater motive in setting them than to encourage appropriate candidates. That's the free market. This is legal aid, paid by the government. Your link showed how much barristers can charge in private practice. No-one is suggesting that fees should be set so high as to compete with the commercial Bar, all that legal aid has to do is provide enough of a living wage to attract the dedicated and skilled barristers that defend the innocent (and yes, obviously, the guilty too). There is a higher motive here, it's not about profit and loss or market factors, it's about ensuring that you have competent legal professionals representing those people who are most vulnerable in society.

4) - Again, the £35-40k figure you quote for pupillage is at the commercial and civil Bar. Actually, let me quote back to you the reality for legal aid barristers. Helpfully, it's from the same source you used, which apparently you only read the first paragraph of. It's so appropriate I'll quote it in full:

""At the publicly funded bar, the picture is very different. Indeed, it's so different that it's hard to believe we're talking about the same profession. Graduate recruits at legal aid barristers' chambers scrape by on the minimum pupillage award of £12,000, with many forced to supplement this with additional part-time work or financial assistance from their families. Earnings then climb to around £20,000-£30,000. A select few go on to make big money, but many senior criminal and family barristers find themselves earning not much more than £50,000 a year once chambers expenses have been deducted – a decent wage, but the sort of money their counterparts at the commercial bar could generate in a month. For a while now, with a few highly socially committed exceptions, the top law graduates have been steering clear of legal aid.""

Finally, let's deal with the ""lefty"" thing. The people we're talking about, legal aid barristers, are surviving on annual incomes that cannot possibly be described as middle class. If you are a pupil barrister at a legal aid firm, you may be literally better off on benefits. So, aside from my point above about ensuring competent representation for the vulnerable (fairly lefty, no?) you're left with a situation where the only people who can afford to do legal aid work are those who have the sheer doggedness to take on alternative part-time work as well, or those who have family money. You want a diverse and representative legal-aid bar? Then don't cut legal aid! Otherwise it's going to be mostly upper-class white men and women surviving on the family trust fund (who may well be competent barristers, but who hardly help the profession be seen as embracing equality).",0,1389206480,null,0,false,0,ceklfs5,t3_1uk7wk,t1_ceklfs5,t1_cek27uw,null,1431855658,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,frankster,null,null,"&gt; You seem to want a free society as long as it holds to your moral system.

I want a free society for individuals, but I do not want freedom for corporations. Freedom for corporations leads to monopoly, exploitation and slavery. Yes - the slave trade until the 19th century, and the use of slave workers by various well known corporations in nazi germany are an example where corporate freedom and the profit motive had bad consequences. This was permitted by the legal systems at the time, but that doesn't mean its ok. Our legal system should set the ethical parameters within which corporations may operate. Freedom for corporations absent of regulation would mean that profits trump ethics. 

Monopoly is the natural outcome in many markets, particularly those with increasing returns to scale. Monopoly is almost universally reviled and unless you advocate a complete laissez-faire approach, requires regulation restricting the freedom of corporations in order to avoid monopoly.

Allowing corporations to exploit addicts is unethical and I would not allow corporations to drive addiction through advertising. If a corporation can enslave someone that person is no longer free. Individual liberty has greater importance than corporate freedom.

&gt;  I have enjoyed gambling in the past and if companies are not free to advertise their service to me then you are preventing free association

I would do nothing to stop you gambling or finding out from your friends where they gamble. The only personal freedom that I could possibly be impinging upon is the personal freedom to be the recipient of specific advertisements. Again, you go off and gamble as much as you like.

&gt; There is good evidence to show eating wheat is highly correlated to ill health - autoimmune diseases, dementia etc. Should there be a ban on wheat too?

I am specifically against banning things partly because it doesn't work very well and partly because it is illiberal. I'm not sure how you make the leap that with respect to personal liberty taxing smoking is equivalent to banning wheat.

If scientific evidence shows that wheat causes significant harm in aggregate, then I would not ban wheat (because I believe in individual liberty).

I'm not sure if everyone is aware of the documented, accepted facts, but to summarise quickly:

* Multiple officers claimed to see Mark Duggan holding a gun when he was shot. This was found to be not true by the jury (note the jury can't say they were lying but the only other implication is they all hallucinated \ imagined it).

* Three officers and one civilian, all witnesses, claimed to have seen an officer throw the gun over the fence. The IPCC confirm this. However after ""interviews"", the three officers in question withdraw their comments, and claim to have seen nothing, while the civilian witness sticks to his story. This last point almost sounds like conspiracy theory bullshit, but it's the IPCC's own account of events:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Mark_Duggan#IPCC_explanations

Basically the officially accepted account of events is that 3 police officers themselves claimed to have seen a colleague plant the gun, and then all decided they'd imagined it. Much like the police officers imagined the gun. This is a seriously seriously fucked state of affairs.

true,TheMemo,cnty-uk,Bristol,"Well, in the specific case we were discussing, property (or, rather, shelter) is a basic necessity so, if the cost of being a landlord increased across the entire 'landlord industry,' there would be no choice in the matter, prices would rise throughout, and the consumers would have to deal with it in the absence of an alternative. Conceivably, mortgages would be more competitive, but we've seen that banks and their lending are also a huge distorting influence on the market and, if they make more money from landlords and buy-to-let mortgages, then that's what they will stick with. 

But, yes, that was a generalisation that I made.

In a free market, of course, supply and demand is the key. However, it is actually a very small part of the fundamentals of making money because both supply and demand are vulnerable to a wide variety of manipulation and distortion. Marketing, for example, has largely replaced or augmented price testing in many large industries - moving the question from 'what will people pay' to 'how much can we convince people that this is worth' - because demand for things that aren't necessities is a matter of value and value perception (hence car manufacturers selling a 'lifestyle' and aspirational advertising in general). By the very reality of human nature, that value perception is a big distortion of the supply/demand proposition which is, ultimately, why nothing works properly (especially capitalism). In systems analysis, we often call this the 'human problem' as it is difficult to engineer systems that work with fundamentally irrational actors. It is, however, a matter of perspective - and if you make no value judgements, then the current system works fine. 

So, an industry-wide taxation would increase prices substantially, but taxation or other punitive measures on a subset would make others more competitive. Right? Well, not only could we see a distortion through marketing but - given that those who are fined often constitute a larger percentage of the marketplace - we could see a situation of artificial scarcity where those who are fined reduce their output / take their things off the market until such a time where demand has raised the prices to such a level that they can offset their costs. In the case of housing (and everything else), only those of sufficient size and reserves would be able to weather this, but it can and does happen (most notably to office space here in Bristol where, in a lot of cases, it is better to leave buildings empty and still have assets at a certain value to borrow against, rather than rent those places out at a level that the market will bear, reducing the value of those assets despite the fact that they are 'working').

I have no real idea what the story is with that website, but it cites exactly the paper I posted but misstates the conclusion. That page honestly does very little to establish ""What is the problem?"", as it is titled. The majority of citations on that website are seemingly to demonstrate that immigration does, in fact, occur - only a handful trying to demonstrate the effect, with one saying it has little effect on personal income for existing nationals and another (mis-cited) saying that it benefits them.

IMO there's a pretty big difference between academic papers and poorly cited websites. [Here's another focusing on A8 countries finding substantial benefits](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-5890.2010.00106.x/abstract), although I'm afraid it's behind a paywall (you can read the abstract).

Our government needs to actively dissolve poorer areas, by integrating council houses in more middle class areas. The children then mix with middle class children, who have parents who give a shit, they end up staying in their houses, see them grow up and have jobs, more equal peers means a more equal adulthood. Rather than one of crime and prison. 

I live in Liverpool, the people of Toxteth have a different, more 'fuck society' ideology that runs strong through the people there. These people need to integrate into the rest of the city, which means councils selling their houses for cheap, building new houses elsewhere and integrating people under the WANT to better themselves, work, and have a 'lets make our country a fucking powerhouse' mindset. 

The left would take issues with this saying there is no problem. The right would say why should poor people get free houses in our area. The same ideology that holds back the people in these ghettos is prevalent through ordinary people, just in different ways which hinders progress.

It's funny how British police have ""no choice"" but to kill someone based off nothing more than a hunch or fear of weaponary, which has happened on multiple occasions over the past 30 years. Hell, no shots were even fired this time except by Police. 

Yet, Iceland's (Granted, they're tiny) armed police have only ever killed one person. One. Even then, they were certain he had a gun, because he was shooting *at* them. 

I really don't understand how a country with as much crime as the UK can comparitvely be so untrained for armed response in comparison to a much smaller, less frequently used armed response of Iceland. 

&gt;rk Duggan was a bad man who had an illegal gun. 

Ah yes. I forgot about that law, if you're bad, and have a gun, the death sentence is clearly appropriate.

Duggan went to Leyton to collect a gun from someone the Met knew was selling firearms and they were collecting evidence against. The guy handed him the gun (in a box) through the window of the minicab. All this while the police were tailing them, they saw that happen.  
  
The cab then took him to Tottenham. The police wanted to use the chance to get both evidence against Duggan and the guy who sold the gun, and had caught them in the act. So they called in firearms officers and, with a number of cars, forced the minicab to pull over before it got to the tube station. Likely this all happened pretty fast so they could get to Duggan before he got into the London Underground. (Where he becomes a guy on the tube with a gun, the sort of situation the police really want to avoid because it could become a hijack/hostage situation)  
  
The cars pulled the minicab over, and there are 3 firearms cars, all surrounding Duggan's cab, pulling it over to the kerb on the left. Duggan seems to have panicked, got out fast and chucked the gun over a fence, and an officer mistook this for Duggan getting pulling his gun on the policemen themselves. This will all have happened in a split second. The officer shot twice but I'm not sure what happened or what sort of gun the police were using; if it was auto or burst fire that could easily have happened very fast.

Not advocating a ""legislation of morality"" in the slightest.

If gamblers had a complete choice about whether to gamble or not, and whether to use these machines or not, it wouldn't be an issue.  As it stands, gambling addicts (as I linked to in my other post) cite these machines as the source of their worst gambling, and a number hugely disproportionate to their use of them.  

They are only in use because they are such a trap.  They serve no purpose but to make money.  A minority will get enjoyment; a majority, because of the nature of gambling, will lose.

&gt;If everyone in the UK who drank beyond their weekly recommended units actually cut down to the maximum rate the profits of the alcohol industry would go down by 40% (which is more remarkable when you consider how problem drinkers tend to stick to the cheap stuff).

And that would be great.  The drinks industry has a hell of a lot to answer for given mortality from liver disease in this country.  

Extending your drinks analogy, these betting terminals are like allowing 90% ethanol/sugar drinks to be sold.  The potential for abuse and injury far exceeds their potential use for enjoyment.

When someone gets out of a taxi, runs, then holds a phone in the air (Usually a sign of surrender) you only have seconds to react?

The police could assume I have an RPG in my boot, does that make it okay for them to kill me this evening?

Imminent implies at this very moment.

They did not know he had a gun at that very moment which means they did not know if he was an imminent threat, they did not know if they could shoot.

So what do we know?

1) He's been given a lot of chances. Anyone who argues ""he hasn't had a chance to prove himself"" is talking nonsense up against the stats.

2) He's not getting any younger. He's 24 years old. I know he might not be a wonderkid like Lukaku, Oscar, Hazard and so might not develop as quickly or be anywhere near as talented, but I doubt he's going to improve much beyond his current level.

3) Clearly he's not impressing the person who counts - Mourniho - to get a start ahead of Dave. Even when we've had to play Dave at RB, Mourinho has still opted to bring the out-of-favour Cole on instead of Bertrand. 

It seems clear to me that he'll never be our starting LB. Even with Cole falling out of favour with Mourinho, his go-to LB is Dave who is really a RB. I think he'd be better off going elsewhere and getting first team football because everything shows that he's not thought of by the people who matter in the same light as some of the people in this sub.

When we won the CL and everyone was so chuffed, back to the glory days etc we though. Then a horrible day, when Stevie G said he was leaving for Chelsea. I remember climbing out of bed the next day at 8am (hey, I was 15!) to watch SSN and I saw:

""BREAKING NEWS: Rick Parry: ""Steven Gerrard has decided to stay at Liverpool. He will sign a new contract shortly.""

Something to that affect. THAT was this similar feeling of ""could be something great happening here alright...""  

08/09, now THAT was what success felt like. Watching every match, expecting a win. Not like now, where even when I expect us to win, in the back of my mind there's this niggling ""but, you know..."". There was something so assured, something so perfect about that team Rafa built.

Which made 09/10 so much more brutal to take in. And since then all LFC fans have been so scared of a repeat haha. I think also, the squad is pretty poor beyond the starting XI, relative to great teams of the past. But surely, that's a good sign: that we're doing very well with a squad that is at most three transfer windows away from being well balanced.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; I want a free society for individuals, but I do not want freedom for corporations. Freedom for corporations leads to monopoly, exploitation and slavery.

Corporations can not have any special privileges when individual rights are taken in to consideration. As a corporation is no more than a group of individuals granted rights they could not have without the help of some kind of authority. Therefore, the problem here is the authority that grants those rights in the first place.

&gt; Monopoly is the natural outcome in many markets, particularly those with increasing returns to scale. Monopoly is almost universally reviled and unless you advocate a complete laissez-faire approach, requires regulation restricting the freedom of corporations in order to avoid monopoly.

I do advocate a complete laissez-faire approach funnily enough. I don't see how a free society can exist without it. All other economic systems can work within a laissez-faire system with the idea of free association. I haven't seen any evidence that monopoly is the natural outcome in many markets; even today when corporations enjoy regulatory capture and corporate welfare both which restrict competition there are very few, if any?, monopolies.

&gt; The only personal freedom that I could possibly be impinging upon is the personal freedom to be the recipient of specific advertisements.

Yes! This is stopping free association between individuals. It is against individual liberties. This is why I said in a free society you have to be forgiving of other moral systems otherwise you end up with a more coercive society rather than less.

&gt; I am specifically against banning things partly because it doesn't work very well and partly because it is illiberal. I'm not sure how you make the leap that with respect to personal liberty taxing smoking is equivalent to banning wheat.

Oh, sorry I meant taxing wheat in that case. I believe taxing is just a way of saying others know best how to spend my money. If people want to pay for things like decades of wars, bailing out banks, public sector pensions, subsidising oil companies and the rest I believe things like that are best financed through voluntary contributions. Personally, I feel they take from the economy rather than add, so I would not pay for things like that - I would rather spend my money on things i value.

&gt; Yeah fuck everyone's enjoyment because some people aren't responsible, great idea. Lets ban every enjoyable activity that some people take too far, drugs, gambling, porn, smoking, drinking, sugary/fatty food, gaming etc. anything that has the potential to be destructive if abused.

Calm down, that's clearly not what I'm saying. I'm not saying we should ban gambling (or any of those other things for that matter), that's patently absurb.  However, the evidence is that this form of gambling, very high stakes, fixed odds, is especially damaging to a small and vulnerable proportion of society.  The suggestion from regulators is to reduce the maximum stake from £100 to something much closer to the typical bet, say £2-5.

Let me put forward an analogy of my own: regulating these machines is akin to road speed limits.  Some people like to drive fast, and some do it safely.  A large proportion, however, can't, and are a risk to themselves and others.

Essentially the guidance is that you can never be wrong to shoot someone if, and only if, you believe there is an imminent threat to human life and use the minimum force necessary.  I expect the rules the police work by are very similar.

That's the only decision that needs to be made.  If someone is holding a weapon but I don't honestly believe they'll use it a shot would not be legal.  If a 5'0"" guard is being aggressively approached by a 6'6"" bloke with a baseball bat threatening murder, a shot may be legal.  If someone throws a molotov cocktail at me but doesn't appear to have another ready to go, I can't shoot at him.

Someone doesn't actually have to be able to threaten life for a shot to be legal.  The only rule that has to be satisfied is to reasonably believe that they are doing so.

When it comes to the shoot to kill or to disable argument, there's no question.  All shots are aimed at the centre of mass.

Three other officers later testified that the weapon was found the other side of the fence. Yet the video footage shows it couldn’t have been found at the time they said. Contradictory statements emerged in the immediate aftermath – and led to accusations of a cover-up.""

That's why the time aspect is most relevant. SMS messages and FOBTs let you place another bet every 30 seconds, horses take a while, and the binary options you mention take 5 or 15 minutes. If the betting machine was two times slower, gamblers obviously wouldn't spend twice as long at the shop.

&gt; How would you limit and control it? What kind of gambling is acceptable?

We need the bookies to be required to release the sort of statistics that would let the regulations be adjusted to offer a good balance between letting people enjoy gambling and preventing problem gambling. And we need to collect information that shows how people are gambling so that we can make the regulations tougher when gambling usage increases too much. And we need to tax the gambling industry enough to pay for all this.

You also need to look at how it unfairly affects the gambling experience, for example: does somebody who bets the maximum of £20 get much less enjoyment than somebody who bets the maximum of £100? No, the enjoyment is about the same. So why let them spend the extra £80?

(The bit being entirely nonsensical anyway considering for 99.99% of human history and situations, travelling 50 miles away from your home was enough to make you a stranger and outsider, and thus potentially making your ""shit pretty bad"" regardless of skin colour.)

Mentioning it in the context of this decision, or conflating the decision with your other examples, is hyperbolic to the point of inanity.

The suggestion that drugs are ""by and large not associated with violent crime"" is clearly moot in this instance since he was an alleged drug dealer who had just purchased a fire arm. I think the argument often made regarding the ""War On Drugs"" is that criminalisation pushes the drug trade into the hands of violent criminals needlessly. Your link relates to a system and situation which is entirely different. Namely, the prison industry in America needs and receives a massive amount of traffic because their inmates are often used as cheap labour by private industry, whereas for decades now British judges and governments have fought tooth and nail to keep people out of prison/the system, because we don't have the same amount of private interest and we can't afford it.

Duggan? Yes, I'm sure he was targeted by a huge, expensive, time-consuming, labour-intensive investigation and sting because of racist police /s. He had connections to white criminal networks across England and Europe, networks the police are fighting every day when they're not shooting people because of their racist inclinations.

While it has ended with a mixed-race man being shot dead in an area with a large black minority, the primary purpose of this whole operation was to fight crime, not alike at all to some LA traffic cops getting their jollies beating someone.

Shooting an unarmed man is one thing, bringing race into it is [quite another](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1upu59/mark_duggan_was_lawfully_killed_in_tottenham_in/cekifzg); he was not a person of interest because of his colour, he was a person of interest because he was an alleged criminal.

true,MoonDuskUK,null,null,"Well, to answer this question you have to think about what the companions job is. Not only in the context of the show but in the context of the shows impact on the viewers.

The companion has many roles while being with The Doctor. One of them is to ask questions so that the people watching know what The Doctor is talking about throughout the episode, and I just think that having an alien companion might mean that nothing is really explained.

Another role is to be the human element in the story. Humans generally have a different perspective of the universe than aliens do. For example, if you took The Doctor to a new galaxy, he probably won't be that excited because that is the sort of thing that he see's everyday. But if you took a human to a new galaxy then they would have a whole different perspective on the subject. This makes the show a whole lot more amazing.

But most of all, humans, fascinate The Doctor. He loves to see their view on the universe, how they react and how they make the universe such a vibrant and amazing place. There is a reason he always comes to earth. It's because we are fantastic.

Also, in respect to the show they would have to do prosthetics and masks every time they are on camera. That could become costly. throughout a 13 episode series.

Where does that study say the majority of people using those specific machines become self-destructive addicts?

Also speed limit laws in many cases are an example of unnecessary state nannying, look at countries like germany with no speed limits in certain areas yet low road deaths. The majority of people are responsible and don't go crazy with extra responsibility.

Obviously leaks happen almost every single time, but that doesn't mean LFC hasn't done well to protect themselves against that this time.  It doesn't seem terribly uncommon for us to not hear about a potential signing until just days before it happens too.  There's 23 days left in the month, be patient.

There's no reason to just signplayers because we can, or just spending money because we can.  I want our cash spent on the right players, in the right positions, to directly improve our team.  I'm very happy that we're picky about who we look to bring in and not making wild panic buys (remember when we blew £35mil straight out our asses for Carroll?).  Maybe Wenger can do exceptionally well when he pushes the ""oh shit"" button on transfers, but it usually doesn't work out well for the club that's acting deperate.  Our calm demeanor serves us well as it makes the statement that we're not in need and won't be victimized by any bullshit in negotiations on fees and such.  Just because we're calm doesn't mean we don't care.  I'm so fucking pumped we take this calculated approach to transfers now so we're not constantly signing Stewart Downing (read: overspending on mediocre players).",0,1389216322,null,0,false,0,cekq8gm,t3_1uq701,t1_cekq8gm,t1_cekmnb7,null,1431858044,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

That said, I always assumed that the end of the time war was time locked because that was one of the functions of the moment.  The Time Lords and Daleks were time travelers, so of course any attempt to use a weapon to destroy an entire galaxy (The moment is referred to as the ""galaxy Eater"") could be over-turned by some easy time travel.  The best way to ensure ultimate destruction is to make that piece of time Time Locked.

With that said, the Moment HAD a consciousness, and didn't want to destroy the Time Lords or the Daleks or both, and therefore allowed 10 and 11 entry into the time lock as a last ditch effort to save the Time Lords and the Daleks...  Or even itself.  Is the moment destroyed if it is used?  Regardless, it wasn't used, and even more scary, still presumably exists.

Political differences - things being forced upon Scotland despite Scotland opposing them - the most well known of this being the Bedroom tax. Plus spending being disproportionally towards London and the south of England to the detriment of everywhere else. These would probably be the main thing and there will be many examples if you look up.

Some less common arguments could be nuclear weapons - Scotland opposes them and would not allow them in the country, while the UK likes them and wants to have them, so if you are against nuclear weapons this could be a point to make.

And another point would be the EU. If you like the benefits it brings then the UK's anti-EU stance is quite worrying, it would be bad if we got forced to leave because of what the rest of the UK voted for. 

Plus you have quite a lot of nastiness by the UK recently - wanting to get rid of the ECHR, supporting the GCHQ and NSA, terrorizing the people trying to expose them, as well as ignoring and even suppressing evidence that opposes what they want to do. Now obviously those are arguments against the current government rather than the country in general, but they don't give a good impression to anyone deciding which way to vote. A no vote means we probably end up with more of the same, while a yes vote gives us a chance to prevent this type of behavior by the government and set a better example.

Shanks basically made this room and these meetings a place the staff could go and talk about anything and everything and the coaches responded to that. Everyone in the bootroom was equal there was no manager no coaches just relaxed debate.

The samples the police had taken were found to be from almost a week later as they had salt that had been spread by the council. The police had said they took all samples straight away and tried to maintain this stance despite the evidence. I believe nothing was done against the farmer because of the way the police carried out the investigation so poorly and lied about it later.

I do not agree that simply failing to do what an armed officer tells you to do gives them an acceptable reason to shoot you dead.

&gt; In the act of throwing the gun and failing to comply, Duggan gave the police cause to believe he was a direct threat.

This statement suggests that you believe that police *saw* Duggan throw the gun away. I haven't seen this suggested anywhere but if so, makes things even worse as they would then have *known* he was unarmed.

I guess it's pointless us arguing the specific facts of this case as neither of us know them for sure. 

We also clearly have very differing opinions of what we believe are acceptable conditions under which it's lawful for police officers to shoot and kill someone. I think we'll just have to agree to disagree...

Edinburgh Zoo, Camera Obscura (an optical illusions museum on the Royal Mile just before the castle, fantastically entertaining for any age and it teaches you a wee bit about the history of Edinburgh too!), the Royal Botanic Gardens, all the galleries (Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in particular), the castle itself (although it's a pricey entry fee and isn't *really* worth it), Edinburgh Dungeon (similar kind of format to any ""Dungeon"" attraction in the UK/Europe, basically an actor/series of actors who are dressed up in historical dress take you on a tour around a set made to look like dungeons, and they tell you a bit about Edinburgh's gruesome past while making you laugh along the way), Mary King's Close or any of the ghost tours from the centre.

I'm a bit confused, you said you were coming around Oct/Nov but in another comment you said you were coming in August? October/November might have the odd film festival happening, otherwise August (as mentioned elsewhere) is the time of the Edinburgh Festivals (International Festival - theatre and dance, Art - nuff said, Books - great talks by renowned authors and cool stuff like that, Fringe - world famous comedy proving grounds full of pros and amateurs) and a limitless supply of events and entertainment throughout the city.

Restaurant wise, a local magazine recently ran a survey where readers voted on their favourite places to eat and drink in Edinburgh and Glasgow - the results are [here](http://www.theskinny.co.uk/food/food_drink_survey/food_drink_survey_2014_scotland/306650-food_drink_survey_2014_winners_scotland) and there are some great choices on there. Personally, one of my favourite restaurants in Edinburgh is [Under the Stairs](http://www.underthestairs.org/) - it's a little hidden away but has great character and amazing food. For quick + tasty eats, Illegal Jacks and Wannaburger are both independent joints that have real charm - they feel like they should be franchised!

For quirky shops and things I'd echo the recommendation of Grassmarket (particularly Victoria St which curves up from there towards the Royal Mile).

I can't tell if you're deliberately or accidentally missing the point...there's basically nobody complaining about the *concept* of people earning more for doing more or having more responsibility. The problem is that this was already the case, but for no clear economic reason the executives are rapidly accumulating more pay whilst wages elsewhere rise very little or stagnate (or, in real terms, lose value).

This is perceived as unfair  because the issue isn't about people with harder jobs being paid more (as you try to frame it), but about them being paid increasingly but (many perceive) unjustifiably more whilst everyone else doesn't benefit.",0,1389219373,null,0,false,0,cekrrsg,t3_1uqbwe,t1_cekrrsg,t1_cekrf3w,null,1431858769,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

He got out of the car **with** the firearm and threw it over the fence.   
  
We don't disagree there. So there are three scenarios;  
    
**1** The police *saw* Duggan in possession of a firearm, he refused to comply, they shot him.  
  
**2** Duggan had already thrown the firearm over the wall. The police *thought* he was in possession and when he refused to comply, they shot him.

true,sir_flopsey,scot-Renfrewshire,Renfrewshire,"While you are better going to /r/scotland for pro independence arguments due the people there being largely for it, I will give you one or two points.

1. Half of the time Scotland does not get the government it votes for, an example of this is how the main party of the coalition the conservatives who are hated by many Scots only have one Scottish seat out of over 50. This is partly due to England being so much larger and therefore getting the government it wants but also due to the FPTP system. If Scotland were to go independent it would not only get the party it voted for but the electoral system of the scottish parliament is more democratic due to the additional members system.

2. An independent Scottish government would manage the economy in favour of Scotland whereas currently the economic policy of the UK is heavily biased towards the south east of England and London sucking away investment and jobs from Scotland, Wales and the rest of England.

3. The way Scotland votes seems to indicate that it is more left wing than an increasingly right wing England as indicated by how very few Scots vote conservatives.  England also seems to be far more eurosceptic than Scoltand as evidenced by the success of UKIP in local elections, if Scotland were to stay in the UK it could mean being dragged outside of the EU along with the UK even if the majority of scots voted against it.

4. Scottish independence might very well be incredibly beneficial to scottish culture and help solve what some people see as a [scottish cringe.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_cringe)

Economic arguments vary but here is a [pro independence page on the subject.](http://www.businessforscotland.co.uk/10-key-economic-facts-that-prove-scotland-will-be-a-wealthy-independent-nation/) You could probably visit the [yes scotland](http://yesscotland.net/) website to see some of their arguments and recently this independence group was launched that features some more economic arguments from a [right wing perspective.](http://www.wealthynation.org/)",0,1389220488,null,0,false,0,ceksbs7,t3_1uqn2d,t1_ceksbs7,t3_1uqn2d,null,1431859030,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; In any market with increasing returns to scale, and no exogenous shocks and some other assumptions there is no other possible outcome other than monopoly.

Maybe a smaller market, even a duopoly, but I don't know of any monopolies from the past in relatively free-markets. There is no evidence for this.

&gt; Taxes aren't just about appropriating money, they can also be used to modify incentives or to counteract externalities. People acting not in the best interests (e.g. addiction) and companies polluting while leaving the cleanup to society are obvious examples.

Addicts 100% do act in their own interest, we all do, and that is where we are parting company on individual rights, I think - I say an individual knows what is best for himself unless mentally ill, I think you disagree with that and think there's some overarching moral structure everyone ought to abide by. 

A polluting company should pay restitution for damage done. There's no need for tax for that to happen though, it can be done with property rights laws.

&gt;  ...building roads, emergency medical treatment, ensuring that this country isn't run by Germans, putting out fires...

They can all be done more efficiently with the free-market. Waging war is a different case because you can only have the wars we have with the state involved printing, borrowing and taxing the money needed for them to happen. Defence of a free society could be the biggest problem for the same reasons.

I'll leave you with this in case you are ever interested. here's a video about roads in a free society, below. It's the first thing people normally bring up if you mention it to them - ""what about the roads?""

1. Replicate on an individual level dataset i.e. the unit of analysis is the person, not the country. The relationship will be in the same direction in my experience, but again, more a gripe about the study design.
2. Couple of points. First there are a number of predictors of income outcomes (not purely determined by a priori class conditions) e.g. in utero growth history, IQ, psychological factors. Any of these would attenuate the relationship. Indeed, in most social science there is so much unexplained that it could be an unobserved/able influence (this is a common objection in a lot of social science peer review- I don't mean to be evasive). Secondly, if the relationship were robust to controls, why not present results with controls? 
3. This comment is wrong. Temporal ordering is necessary to establish causation under Bradford-Hill criteria. The book fails to do this, I'm not sure why the poster seems to think it did so in any adequate manner.

For places to eat there are a fair few nice restaurants in L1 serving italian, mexican etc, or most pubs will do a decent meal. There are a couple of whetherspoons knocking around that do a burger and a beer for £5 I think.

Some of the editing was quite well done, the mother was portrayed on more than one occasion as being utterly vain, self centred and failing to be a 'good mother'.  The man was shown to be work focused and 'traditional' to the point where you wondered if he was actually her husband.

And so on.  All of which was done with editing and subtle (or not) manipulation of them to get just what was wanted.  The piste de resistance being a highly edited interview with the runners up to get on the show who all but called the family crap in every way. 

In the 20 odd years since the 1900's House aired it seems that whilst everyone knows what Photoshop is and can do nobody has a clue the mischief you can get up to in Final Cut or Première.

As general rule, Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays are the days most people seem to go out, so if you want the biggest choice of clubs, this is when to go out, but if you want a quiet drink, you should pick another day, or you need to really know where you're going! In the summer though, it'll be a bit quieter anyway, as lots of students will have gone away.

There's two main areas of night clubs: the roads around Concert Square are where the students tend to go, and the area around Mathew Street is more popular among people in 30s/40s and has more gay bars. I'm going to assume that you'll be looking at Concert Square -  for a night out, my favourites are [Heebie Jeebies](https://plus.google.com/115062213805495643369/about?gl=uk&amp;hl=en) on Seel Street, [Bar Ca Va](https://plus.google.com/101637101154264086806/about?gl=uk&amp;hl=en) and [KrazyHouse](http://www.thekrazyhouse.co.uk/main.html), in that order - Heebie Jeebies stays pretty busy outside of the University terms so try there first! Don't bother paying to get into anywhere unless you know it's going to be good - some places are dead in the summer holiday, and you'll look silly paying £3 dance on your own in an empty room! Avoid [The Blue Angel](https://plus.google.com/112850124977871864710/about?gl=uk&amp;hl=en) (aka The Raz) at all costs - it's very cheap, but not a good idea. There are bad stories. Also avoid the Irish/American sports bars on Lime Street - they're pretty bad.


For old fashioned pubs, I've heard good things about the [Fly in the Loaf](http://www.flyintheloaf.co.uk/) with good local beers and I can vouch for the [Ship &amp; Mitre](http://www.theshipandmitre.com/), but this might be a little out of your way, depending where you're staying. [The Crown](http://www.thecrownliverpool.co.uk/findus/) on Lime Street and [The Philharmonic](http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/the-philharmonic-liverpool) are worth a look just for the interiors - the Phil has heritage-listed marble toilets and lots of [stained glass and oak panelling](http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6018/5943942338_ea4fe980e9_o.jpg).

For good cheap food, or a quiet drink before midnight, [Leaf](http://www.thisisleaf.co.uk/) is really nice, as is [Cafe Tabac](http://www.cafetabac.co.uk/) which are both on Bold Street. My favourite restaurants are [The Quarter](http://www.thequarteruk.com/), [Lucha Libre](http://www.lucha-libre.co.uk/), [Bistro Jacques](http://www.bistrojacques.com/), or [Tokyou](https://plus.google.com/100752643937584363769/about?gl=uk&amp;hl=en), but there's lots of others! Avoid Liverpool One for food though - it's overpriced and you can get much better around Bold Street or Hope Street.

If you're south of the city centre around the Sefton Park area, visit [Lark Lane](http://www.larklaneguide.com/) and eat/drink there instead.

&gt; ""Used the regeneration energy to heal myself""

Healing is what regeneration is for; he regenerated in order to get a new body, one which hadn't just been shot. The Doctor counts it as a proper regeneration, why wouldn't we?

&gt; ""but as soon as that was done I didn't need to change""

As soon as he had regenerated, he didn't change having decided he liked his current self. 

&gt; ""to stop the energy going all the way""

Stop the energy, not stop the regeneration. We don't know what all the way is exactly, we don't know how far it actually went. For all we know the change in appearance and personality is a separate, last second process (which is more or less what we saw on screen; regeneration with a last second zap to the hand).

As above; we don't know what the rest is. 

&gt; ""I'm still me.""

Yes, but he got a new body, hence he wasn't dead. It was just the same as the old one.

None of the above is any more factual than what you propose; we just can't know without a step by step explanation of the processes involved in regeneration, which we'll never get. It could be either way.

Most City supporters at the time mocked them chanting 'What the f****** hell is that', yet many City supporters were inspired and since this game a large number of City supporters have celebrated every goal scored by doing this or initiated the craze by chanting ""Let's all do the Poznan"". with the City supporters refusing to claim the celebration as their own, and simply named it 'The Poznan' in honour of the club that awakened the City supporters to the celebration.""

I was left with the impression the prosecution hadn't done enough to show his guilt and the case they presented made no sense. I wasn't surprised by the verdict. My wife on the other hand was convinced he was guilty based on the edited highlights shown in the evening.

Since then, I've learned that it is impossible to understand a legal case fully without sitting in on it in person, especially during the boring bits (which is most of it) even transcripts can paint a false impression when you don't have the body language to go with it (as you said).

All the way through this inquest, no matter which network I watched, all I heard was ""police cover up"". It's going to be hard for anyone to trust in the jury's decision I think. Even now, the media seem to be focusing on the failings of the inquest, rather than the findings.

I don't know if this is because the standards of journalism have slipped (particularly with 24 hour rolling news), or if I'm just more aware of it. I think it's leading down a dangerous path regardless.

I still trust in the jury system. It doesn't always work, but it mostly does. And this case wasn't held behind closed doors so I trust this was a fair hearing. But just as I've never been able to convince my wife the OJ trial was fair, I don't think a lot of people with genuine grievances with the police are going to be convinced by this inquest.

true,joeflux,null,null,"Okay, so say you can afford a 25% deposit and you put that into a 25 year buy-to-let mortgage.

Then at the end of the 25 years you now have full ownership of the house - you've made 4 times your money back!  Sounds great, right?

What's that in interest per year?

1.058^25 = 4

So you've made 5.8% interest per year on your initial investment.

That not too bad, but not even close to being great, and that's not even factoring in all the fees that you've got when you sell the house.  

Plus the risks - having all your savings in a couple of houses is not diversified at all.  What happens if the housing market drops and you're suddenly left with an upside mortgage?  What happens if you can't rent out the house?  What happens if there's an unexpected problem that means that you can't rent it out for a few months?  What happens if you get bad tenants who refuse to pay, meaning that it will take months to evict them?

For that level of return and risk, you'd probably be better off with just investing it in the stock market.

Of course, if the housing market goes up, then you're doing great.  Although that's exactly the same as the stock market.

I remember reading something about how if you send a greater voltage down a third rail, it produces more heat which means you lose some current, but I couldn't find much in the way of numbers. Even looking at the recent electrification schemes on Network Rail's site.

&gt; appears to imply that a lot of 750VDC equipment will be life-expired within ten years... and Network Rail are seriously considering a full 25kV upgrade instead of sinking more money on DC equipment.

Life-expired equipment is another good point. Also Network Rail have their own designs for 25kv catenary now so they may be looking at the cost of just putting in a mass build of new masts and gantries.

[This article](http://www.globalrailnews.com/2011/01/12/electrification-challenges-and-timescales/) is quite interesting too, it mentions NR's new overhead line equipment designs.

&gt; Assuming the Basingstoke 'electric spine' pilot goes to plan, is it realistic to think the entire rest of the Southern Region can be upgraded that quickly? Picturing the regional railway lines surrounding me, that's masses and masses of entirely new infrastructure on tracks and in tunnels that have never had overhead cables before.

I would say 'no'. Because they still have to finish the North West, London - Bristol - Cardiff - Swansea, London - Sheffield etc.

They have one new high output works train to do the Great Western electrifcation scheme with. If they want to do any more electrification on a larger scale I would think they would need several such trains.

Good point on dual voltage trains. I found [this photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/76437498@N03/10669801776/) on Flickr of a Class 377, they were built with a recess in the roof so that a pantograph could easily be installed in future. I believe the traction motors and transformers etc will cope with dual voltage, most new trains use AC motors even if they are fed from the 750v DC third rail.

&gt;  Maybe the easiest thing to do is to put up 25kV wires for the Electric Spine freight pilot, but keep the existing 750VDC third rails below for current passenger services. Is that feasible, or likely?

true,ProtoKun7,smith,Smith,"&gt;Healing is what regeneration is for; he regenerated in order to get a new body, one which hadn't just been shot. The Doctor counts it as a proper regeneration, why wouldn't we?

It used up a regeneration, except he didn't replace his body with one that hadn't been shot; he healed the damage to his current body caused by the shot.

&gt;As soon as he had regenerated, he didn't change having decided he liked his current self.

Decision has nothing to do with it; the body changes whether he wants it to or not. Siphoning away the energy was the only thing that prevented it.

&gt;""to stop the energy going all the way""
Stop the energy, not stop the regeneration. We don't know what all the way is exactly, we don't know how far it actually went. For all we know the change in appearance and personality is a separate, last second process (which is more or less what we saw on screen; regeneration with a last second zap to the hand).

He stopped the regeneration completing *by* siphoning the energy before the process completed. The two things are directly related. Fuel a vehicle before a trip, but if the fuel is siphoned, it goes to power something else (the separate, duplicated body) before it can be used for travel to a new destination (or body). Both cars do not end up with an equal amount of fuel.

&gt;""siphoned off the rest""
As above; we don't know what the rest is.

The rest of the regeneration energy which completes the process.

&gt;""I'm still me.""
Yes, but he got a new body, hence he wasn't dead. It was just the same as the old one.

It *was* the old one; it was the same body.

As for people being scared of change - that's probably true, but if those people live here then they deserve to have their voices heard. It has been difficult to have a talk about immigration in the past for fear of being labelled racist, xenophobic or bigoted. For instance, many people don't like immigration because they live in an area which has been transformed by immigration, completely changing the image and feeling of the place. Maybe it's fear of change. Maybe it has racist undertones. I'm not sure. But those people have been largely ignored for a long time while we have been repeatedly told that immigration is good.

As I said in the initial post, it's all very well to be told that immigration is good for the country but if you're a low skilled minimum wage employee who was laid off so a Polish lad could take the job, that's a tough message to swallow. Farage is simply saying that he would sacrifice some economic metrics in return for people being more satisfied. I don't see any disagreeable point of view there tbh.

This is an extreme case I grant you. But this is like saying those parents who fly off the handle and verbally attack teachers for detaining their children are correct. Parents need to be aware, if their children act like imbeciles then one day someone is going to hold that child to account on their actions. As a parent you can only but hope that person is someone who cares for the child.

This was a grown man, who had an illegal firearm about his person. There is no doubting a severe judicial process was about to be enacted upon this person and so bloody right.

Of particular interest is [the surrender of the press to private interests in 1694](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licensing_Order_of_1643) in comparison to the careful licensing of radio and television, firstly with the founding of the BBC. 

The former is where the canard of ""300 years of press freedom"" comes from. Even in its own terms it's inaccurate, as publishing was subject to blasphemy and sedition laws up until the 20th century, including strenuous regulation during WW1 and WW2. That's not even to mention the fact that papers were banned from reporting on the House of Commons, allegedly one of the sacred functions of a free and healthy press, until the founding of the press gallery under Pitt the Younger. 

The trouble, as you say, is that whilst the press became increasingly independent of government restrictions it maintained close ties with wealth, another important source of power. Private Eye actually does a reasonable job of publicising the wealthy's shenanigans, though many of their findings go unnoticed by the mainstream media (who often have connections with those being criticised) and thus the general public. 

It's unclear how to best rectify the situation. The BBC is a decent news source on its own terms, though it does have certain institutional biases and is vulnerable to being strongarmed by the government. An astounding fact about the BBC is that it exists essentially on an extension of the probationary contract that founded it and is still not legally a permanent institution. There is also the fact that numerous people continue to buy newspapers, which presumably means they see at least some value in the news stories. I can't believe everybody buys the Sun for the sports section, anyway.

For the time being I see no solution. The liberal left need to realise that the Daily Mail, the Sun and the Express sell well because people buy into their view of the world, at least to an extent. On the other hand all the papers engage in the suppression of information if it is in the interests of their proprietors and their friends.

Kickoff was at 2pm. OP also had tickets to see a short-lived punk band named Magazine play a pub called Eric's, about 10 minutes from Anfield. OP didn't have a lot of time between final whistle and the start of the concert, so his dad drove him straight to the pub. Real Life is the name of an album released by Magazine.  
TLDR: 2-9-1978 was a good day for OP.  

OP: Is this accurate? Next time a little context and complete sentences would help. Also, Magazine recently reunited. I hadn't heard of them until I did the research for this post, but maybe you should listen to their new stuff.

Generally you spend most of the time watching an empty car park of roof interrupted by the journalist having his or her make up put on and listening to sound checks and a light meter being held up to their face and half a conversation with their editor, so not as exciting as it sounds. 

Though you occasionally get to see them uploading their field reports (before the editor gets as chance to make cuts, so sometimes the images can be a bit graphic), though that might no longer be the case as it's probably an instant digital upload rather than an analogue stream.

Best time to see anything interesting is when there is a major story all the networks are covering. Sometimes you are just watching what you'd see live on TV anyway (but without any overlays). It's interesting if you want to see how it works and how many times reporters swear when they are waiting to go live (It's a lot!). 

I bought the equipment so I could watch European channels, the disk was motorised so I could change which satellite it was pointed at, but the internet has mostly made it redundant so I no longer have it (I don't even have a TV anymore, everything is on-line now in my house). Not that you need that level of sophistication to watch news streams. 

I still have my old bookmarks that I used to learn about this but most of them don't seem to work. I found one that seems to have everything you need to start you off, though I don't know how valid this is as I can't find a date when it was last updated.

http://www.net42.co.uk/satellite/

If that's no good, come back to me and I'll try looking again. Don't buy any equipment new, most of what you need you'll find on ebay and you'll need to check you have quite a wide range of uncluttered sky or there isn't much point in buying a motor for the dish.

true,Veridas,eng-kent,The nutter round the corner.,"I'm guessing...

US debt problems will escalate, causing some trade problems in Europe and the far east. Maybe short-term problems, but problems the Eurozone probably doesn't need.

David Cameron will attempt to ride the already swelling tide of the tory party in election-mode. Try to take credit for the ideas of the likes of Osbourne or Johnson or Gove to ease the struggle of the poor, because oh shit poor people will be voting soon. I doubt this will really change much about them.

Labour, contrarywise, will do its best to put up some kind of resistance to the Tories. The dabbling in playing at opposition leader that Ed Miliband has done over issues like Syria, energy bills and living standards will be utilised as still-in-bed Miliband tries to look like he's been paying attention and might be remotely electable. 

The Lib Dems will be very introspective. Asking some very tough questions of Clegg now that the elections are starting to creep closer. Given the scale of Clegg's surrenders and what the public percieve to be what he has received in return (relatively little, even though that's untrue) the party will probably wonder if Clegg can really do very much for them in 2015. Clegg can ally them to a party, yes, but Clegg has also shown that he's too much of a pussy to take some freaking credit or speak up anywhere near as often as is required.

I think Alex Salmond will be forced to have the referendum about an independant Scotland this year in order to have his way on lowering the minimum voting age for that particular referendum. I won't try to predict the result, but I think it'll be funny as hell no matter which side wins. If Alex Salmond gets his way then he'll have to contend with Cameron about what Scotland can keep, which ought to be fun. If he loses then...well it ought to be funny as hell watching him lose.

I think we'll lose a couple of celebrities this year too. The popular music scene is changing somewhat and artists like Enrique Iglesias and Pitbull have both been experimenting with new things, with mixed results. I think stars like Lady Gaga or One Direction might see their fame reduce simply because they seem to be trying to do the same things. 

In terms of business I think we'll continue to hear stories of massive tax evasion. Some new companies will probably be named and shamed. Some might try to recoup some of the loss of face but...I doubt it. As the stories snowball it might manage ti become an issue at the next election, in which case the Conservatives can expect a hammering for doing so little about it for at least a year. There'll probably be some evidence that Labour was also implicit in ignoring some of it, but even if Ed Miliband doesn't take advantage of it, I get the feeling Ed Balls will.

In terms of gaming I think we'll see an announcement for the next Fallout, Call of Duty, and perhaps Tomb Raider games. I think Valve will troll the shit out of us in terms of Half Life and Portal sequels. Someone somewhere might quietly suggest a new Duke Nukem game in a soundproof boardroom and turn up dead the next day with no witnesses and a size twelve boot lodged in his sphincter.

As an example my friend lives in quite a scummy area of Kent and it turned out that the rent (paid directly to the Landlord in this instance) had been overpaid by the housing people for a considerable amount of time.  The Landlord in no uncertain terms told my friend to get that overpayment reinstated or he was adding it to the amount she had to pay... failure would be counted as being in arrears. 

Yes, there are some quite nasty slumlords out there but more to the point with a bit of editing work and some simple lines said in a voice over booth being added long after the camera crews had departed it could be easily presented as my friend not paying the rent. 

If someone showed you a picture of the Queen being shagged by one of the corgi's you'd say it was fake and photoshopped to show something that didn't happen, why with this do you believe it hasn't been edited and that conversation took place verbatim, is it simply the subject matter or are you unaware of what can be done in post-production?

true,Snay,null,null,"Okay, that gives us something to go on...

I'd start at the docks, th e Albert dock in particular is great for tourists, of note is the Beatles Museum and Liverpool Museum. The former should be obvious, the latter focuses on the history of the city, from shipping and the slave trade through  Victorian poverty and workhouses on to the sixties and all that entails, a little bit on deindustrialisation of the 80s to present day. You've also got the Maritime Museum (haven't been for ages, but IIRC it's mostly about the work of the revinue as well as a fairly sizable Titanic exhibit); the Tate and a local photography gallery, the open eye, which is well worth half an hour. All of this is within a stones throw off each other and mostly free, so it's pretty much  obligatory IMO. 

Heading inland from the docks you come to Liverpool One. The park is okay, as well as utility (a local shop for.... Stuff which should be pretty good for a souvener or two). There is also Lunya, a mixture of Catalan and Scouse cuisine (with a focus on the Catalan) that does some wicked tapas if that's your thing. Other than that there isn't much in Liverpool One that you won't find elsewhere, think giant shopping centre. 

Across from Liverpool One you have Matthew Street and the little warren of back alleys that contain the cavern club and a few other places that claim to have hosted the Beatles at some point. To be honest I wouldn't get too excited. The original Cavern Club was demolished in the 70s for the underground, the one you'll find today is essentially a replica built in the 80s for the tourists, but I guess it might be worth a **lunchtime** pint. Evenings and weekends it can get a little..... messy round there, so avoid if you have the kids with you at that sort of time (like, after 6 on a Friday or Saturday). 

In the business district over here you'll find Moose Cafe, which does some spectacular breakfasts. Think OTT Americana, pancakes with maple syrup and bacon, but with a touch of  sophistication of you're up early enough. 

Head back to the main drag and you'll find yourself on Church Street, again more of the big chain shops that are everywhere, but keep going to Bold Street, one of my favourite parts of the city centre, chock full of independent shops and cafes. Of note I would hit the egg which does spectacular vegetarian/vegan food; the kasbah for Moroccan stuff and the current new flavour of the month, Almost Famous Burger on Parr Street (can be tricky to find, ask a local). Giant burgers in an abandoned warehouse theme. That makes it sound awful, but trust me, it isn't. 

FACT is also pretty cool round here. Again all for directions, but it's interactive artworks, video installations and a nice little cinema (see anything good is showing in ""the box"" - it's sort of a cinema with couches). They tend to show classics as well as art house and indie stuff. 

There is also the Walker Art Gallery if you're interested in ""classical art"" and sculpture, and a couple of theatres if you want to take in a show. 

I hope you enjoy Liverpool, please ignore any sense of direction you may have gotten from this as it will be wrong and apologies for formatting/spellings/ autocorrect as I'm on my phone.

A Principality is a country (nominally) ruled by a monarch who carries the title of Prince. A few modern examples exist in Andorra, Monaco and Liechtenstein, all of which are universally recognised as countries. 

I think the confusion in Wales' case stems from the conflation of the words ""country"" and ""Kingdom"" in the minds of some British people. England, Scotland and Ireland were all Kingdoms at the time they joined the Union. Wales was not - it wasn't even a Principality at that point - merely a part of the Kingdom of England. This lesser status seems to have stuck in the minds of some, which I think is the root cause of this Principality nonsense.

Being a Principality and a country at once is perfectly possible, but being a Principality and Kingdom is not. Somehow this obvious truth became twisted so that, in Wales' special case, it was decided that it could not be a country because it was a Principality (which it hasn't been since 1536 anyway).",0,1389232618,null,0,false,0,cekxvcz,t3_1ur9x3,t1_cekxvcz,t3_1ur9x3,null,1431861713,12,false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,12

Sorry but that doesn't sound bad at all to me. Sure when you first look at it for a few seconds it sounds bad but if you think about it it isn't

So firstly which makes it not sound bad is that apparently ""in police custody"" also means up to 48 hours after they've been released. So if i got arrested, let out tomorrow morning, then died up to 2 days later it could still count as under police custody.

Next, in 2010, apparently 1.4million people got arrested in England and Wales. I don't know if thats up or down over years but the following year was 1.2 million so im gonna use the 1.4 million as a very rough average. This brings total arrests since 1970 to 63,000,000. The 1000 seems pretty small now, that makes it 1 in every 63,000 arrests die ""in custody""

Now if you think about it more that includes people who were arrested during heavy fights, during heavy alcohol drinking, during hard drug usage, etc, and many people already have bad health conditions. So if someone gets arrested during heavy drinking and a violent fight, and they die in the cell overnight because of alcohol poisoning or bad internal injuries, sound it be the polices fault? I mean they might just look like any other drunk person and only had a few cuts, it would probably be irresponsible to fully check over the 100,000s who get arrested daily for these kinds of things.

Even if a couple things i've said arent entirely accurate(didn't do too much research. Also going off what i remember when that was posted to reddit a long long time ago), it probably still wouldn't sound bad.

Only the players with a big engine, the ones who can run fast with the ball can do good in these scenarios. Technical players get lost in these games. There is a reason that England can't produce a lot of technical players. Most of the good players who come out of English system are fast/pacy types. Technical players get cast aside I guess, because they can't handle the ""pace of the game"".

&gt;It was, said the coroner, ""certainly a very poor quality indeed"" and DCI Foote told the inquest ""I had no information on which I could have arrested Mark Duggan.""

This (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25363828) says there was no info on which he could be arrested but that's before the shooting incident which was what I meant to differentiate.

&gt;Tests showed no forensic evidence that Duggan had held a gun. His fingerprints and DNA were not on the gun or sock it was in. The jury heard that while areas of Duggan's clothing exposed when police opened fire were covered in gun residue, there was none on the weapon he was supposed to be holding.

But forensics (http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/08/mark-duggan-death-london-riots) show that the claims that he was holding a gun at the time weren't true and it seems the officer's accounts of what happened aren't consistent with tests. What is known for sure is that he was on the phone seconds before the incident so that's possibly what was mistaken for the gun.

&gt;The evidence did not overwhelmingly point to whether or not Duggan had a gun. But what it did point to was that it was unlikely Duggan was preparing to fire on police.

Moffat is a great show runner - as evidenced by casting choices, production values etc.  However he falls short as a writer.  There is far too much emphasis on the overall theme through a series or even during Matt's entire run as the Doctor.  He can write some amazing episodes (Blink) and then he uses the weeping angels so much they have lost all of their luster as a villian.  There are pros and cons with both show runners, but I would agree that the episodes had a much better consistency as solitary stories and gave a much better emphasis on the Doctor as a mysterious gaurdian of life than as a quikry hero girls swoon over with RTD than with Moffat.

But the whole episode is based around the premise that the Master as used up his regenerations and is trying to trick the Time Lords into giving him more (or stealing the regenerations of another Time Lord.) It's right there in the episode. If you want to argue it, take it up with Robert Holmes. He wrote it.

On Aspas, [Fabio Romano](https://twitter.com/FabRomano21) (note: he's one of Di Marzio's people, so he's about as reliable as you can expect a sports journalist to be on transfer rumours) says he's staying at Liverpool (scroll down to around the 4th-6th of Jan to find the relevant tweets). Considering that Liverpool only have 3 strikers (including Iago) and one is injury-prone, it's unlikely they're loaning him out unless at least one more striker comes in in January, which doesn't look like the case.

They've also recently rubbished the Sterling link. I think they may have considered loaning him earlier in the season, but considering how well he's done in recent games, I think he'll be staying at Anfield.

While it is very respectful of you to attempt to get the artist's permission, the subject matter doesn't belong to the artist. In this case, the TARDIS is a BBC copyright and only the BBC can grant permission to reproduce the image of the TARDIS for anything that is to be sold. That also means that if you want to make something for yourself from it, you don't ""need"" the artist's permission, but it's always nice to ask. There's also a chance that they'll be flattered by your request and provide the hi-res files you want, depending on what you plan to do with them. I know you see fan-made T-shirts, prints, whatever being sold all over the place, and most of the time there's little legal action taken, but it IS technically illegal. I guess in the end what I'm saying is that you don't need permission because it is not the artist's to give.

Further, they might have offered him the part as a gesture, so that they could say that they did try to include all of the post-reboot Doctors, with the idea that, when he turned down the part, they weren't out anything and they at least had the offer out there and public.
