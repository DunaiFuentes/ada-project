The council have no such right. I didn't vote for them to be naive on my behalf, or to get involved in foreign affairs.

Anyone who says that our striker force would have been better with Lukaku is absolutely correct, sure. But we sold him. He is not here any more and nothing is going to change that.

The student lives in the students world, the programmer lives in the programmers world, and each uses language a particular way, assuming rather than stating what seems obvious. Which works well as long as you're talking within your group.

All the signs are pointing towards Lamela bouncing back strongly this year after we didn't see him after Christmas. Lamela has shown quality this preseason and has formed quite the connection with Roberto Soldado up top.

Capoue was sort of an unknown last season. He looked great in the beginning under AVB but was not favored by Sherwood. Based on the preseason it seems like Pochettino likes Capoue, he was a tank when he was on the field. Look for him to dominate as a defensive midfielder.

Soldado had a rough year, but he also experienced a perfect storm of off the field issues, and he was quite good in build-up-play. There's no denying his talent at Valencia.

 I find it interesting how people think we can order a new formation or system of a menu and have it work perfectly right away. Our defense was one of our weakest points last season, yet if we sat back and relied on it, we would have won, no question? Don't be so sure.  Every time we switched formations it took a while to fully adjust. Do you remember Gerrard's first games in  a more defensive role? so many people were calling for his head! and now we should have thrown two or three more players into that situation for the Chelsea game? Heck, there were times playing the diamond, a system set up for our strengths, where the adjusting to it was rough. Even if we did manage to out Chelsea Chelsea for a while, considering how well Mourinho knows his system he would have been able to make adjustments.  We were on an 11 game win streak, and the players were full of confidence, I don't object to us playing the style that had carried us to that point.

We have a fair few players from the world cup who most likely wont play the first one or two matches and I would imagine that any potential signings we make wont be able to play the first two games either.

&gt; Which 3 players should other fans watch out for and why?

Erik Lamela - was one of the brightest talents in world football before he joined us but had a season ravaged by injury - apparently the first half of the season he was playing through the injury explaining why he didnt play to his potential and why his injury for the second half of the season was so bad. I would expect him to fulfill his potential this season.

Etienne Capoue - Was injured most of last season but whenever played in his favoured position he was very good. He has bossed it in preseason aswell.

Jan Vertonghen - I think that he can be the best CB in the league this season as he arguably was two seasons ago. He playing under one of the best defensive managers in the league.",0,1407530441,null,0,false,0,cjkuop3,t3_2d0elh,t1_cjkuop3,t3_2d0elh,null,1435142942,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

true,smokey815,num11,,"Players to watch out for:

Lamela - This one is obvious.  He had a dreadful time with injury last year.  He played 9 times for us in the league, only three were starts.  He was never fit for Tim Sherwood's time in charge.  This preseason he has looked fantastic.  And it's not something that you can chalk up to the level of opposition, either.  It's his attitude.  He's confident and calm on the ball, and has been a major part of our attack.  Looking at his time at Roma, it looks like we'll finally see the player we paid for.

Eriksen - By far our signing of the season last year.  His only real competition for our player of the season was Walker and Hugo.  Once he got the freedom to move and create as he wanted, he was among the best creators in the league.  He linked up very well with Adebayor and put in some fantastic performances.  His second half against Southampton was amazing.  Look for him and Lamela to link up with each other, and whoever we put up top.  It will be a very fluid attacking group.

Capoue - This is my personal pick.  Etienne Capoue is a physical monster in the center of midfield, and demonstrates a rare technical ability and passing range for a defensive midfielder.  He suits our new system perfectly, as he is able to drop back and receive the ball from the center backs and move it forward capably and consistently.  He's dominant defensively, and a rock when in possession.  Look for him to be anchoring our midfield and letting the attacking players have more freedom in their movement.

Do you see him as a RB in the future, or do you think he could play a more advanced role seeing as his positioning isn't *there yet*? Wasn't he moved back from the wing to RB, and he doesn't know where his best position is - or am I bullshitting? Or do you think he should stick to RB? I often see RB's I feel would be better more advanced, but I confess - I've not watched any of Yedlin in the MLS so I've got no idea how he is technically - like if he can beat a man, how quick his feet are and so on. He just oozes more flair than a RB, and seems like he would be more comfortable attacking despite a few great challenges and keeping Hazard pretty quiet. 

I agree though. I was in the camp of ''that Belgium game should have been 3-0 by 90th minute'' (no hate, just being honest) but he made a massive impact when he came on. I have a good feeling about him actually, and it's about time the States produced a true talent like you said. Clint was great for us, Brad was a solid keeper but Yedlin seems to have that little bit of extra flair about him and confidence, but still seems a humble kid.

Neither one of those says that Falcao is demanding he be paid that much from a new team.  They're saying he **is currently** paid that much.  Those are very different things.

My entire point is that people are *assuming* that we'd have to pay him 375k/week in order to bring him here.  That isn't the case and neither us nor Madrid would pay those wages.  It's probably part of the reason why Monaco would want that loan fee, because they'd be forced to pay at least part of his wages.

He is very calm and calculating on the attack, something we also see in Eriksen. If Poch can find a way to get them working on the pitch together they could be a force distributing the ball and breaking down defenses.

So his plans **seem** genius on paper, but on the pitch they're **inept.** Monosyllabic enough for ya?

But as a lone striker, I don't see him as anything but a last resort at the moment. He can strike a ball well but his finishing isn't good enough - particularly one-touch finishes - for the role. His movement and runs also seem more suited to coming from deep or ending up around the edges of the box rather than in natural finishing positions. Not to mention the fact that we'd lose out on all he can do elsewhere on the pitch. 
 
I actually could see him playing as an emergency false-9, though I could also see Coutinho playing that role with Sterling being a great option to have flanking him.

true,RifleEyez,null,null,"Holtby is not a ball winner at CM. He's not a CM and he should never be played there - he doesn't know what he's talking about ;) Seriously. He closes down too much there and tires himself out, and it's too deep for him to have an impact - he's agile, quick over a few yards with an eye for a killer pass and slipping in perfect weighted balls over the top or through. From an advanced position. He's also got a great work rate, and would be a lot less tired if he is just closing down the CB's/DM's of the opponents and sticking to AMC rather than MC. He's similar to Kagawa - I want him to play the same role he did at Dortmund. 

Ignoring signings, right now I would rather Bentaleb next to Capoue right now with Holtby as the AMC so he's free to find space and press when he needs too and Eriksen on the Left out of possession, Lamela on the right, but drifting when we have the ball. If/and when Schneiderlin comes in, I want them 2 with Bentaleb as backup for them. He's still only 19, has half a season under his belt and the WC so I'm fine with Morgan/Etienne over him.  Bentaleb has a wider range of passing and is 6'2 and stronger, so fits the deeper role much more than Lewis does.

Pharmaceutical companies are ruthlessly competitive (I worked in one for a while looking at their pricing strategy) and relentlessly driven to find and market 'blockbusters'. Everybody knows that in ten to twenty years time new-mechanism antibiotics will be worth their weight in gold, but no drugs company is seriously developing them because they can't bank profits in twenty years time, they need profits NOW. 

With that in mind, suppose the conspiracy was true; there's a cure for cancer which Roche has (say) that they're sitting on. In the UK alone this cure would be worth something like £30bn per year (assuming people still contract cancer at the same rate) so a blockbuster to end all blockbusters, and this is far less than Roche are making on their current-line cancer treatments. So there's no obvious reason for them not to market it given that greed is their only motive. Furthermore, they haven't patented the drug (or else we would know about it) meaning that any day one of their competitors could swoop in and take the whole £30bn pie. Why would they ever, ever take that risk? No matter how attractive the steady drip of life prolonging drugs might be, a competitor curing cancer would end ALL of this incremental income, plus you would get nothing (how do you think the public would react if Roche said 'Actually WE have a cure too, we just didn't tell you about it'?)

They change the entire foundation of the vote just to gain some more ballot papers, fucking pathetic. 

The local governments have been getting more and more power and it hasn't been life changing so thats kinda void until they actually change dramatically county to county. 


Without a large centralised governement who the fuck would run the UK national systems and overseas matters? Go Federal, yeah because that makes sense... I mean its not as if out constitution is based upon rapid change lending itself to a flexible system, unlike Federalism, take the US 20 reforms in a hundered years, 10 are the bill of rights, the 2 after that were bill of rights that didn't make it the first time round, then the rest were reforms cancelling out other reforms, that is since the birth of the USA in the last 4 years the UK has probably had more. 




Our Devolved governments with a strong London based central one is key to the UK, without it a home nation would crumble.

Like Lennon is equally fast as fuck (maybe he's lost a bit of pace), but he probably won't feature much as he's a right footed right winger - not a traditional winger and he's not great on the left.

Firstly it's absolute data. Muslims only make up about 6% of the EU population and this hasn't been taken into account. A quick back of envelope scrawl puts the weighted average at 6.6% of attacks, if we include separatists. See point two.

Secondly the data is massively skewed by Spanish separatist movements. It's not really helpful to the argument as it essentially just tells us that the group of people that are most likely to commit terrorist attacks are members of ETA. This doesn't really tell us anything. 

Thirdly this does not take into account foiled plots. Just because an extremist group doesn't have the know how and funding that groups like ETA have or the IRA had, does not mean that they are morally superior. 

Finally it doesn't take into account the nature of the Attack. A political extremist shooting a police chief or detonating a bomb outside of an evacuated building, is not the same as trying to blow up a plane or 7/7 or any event that deliberately targets civilians.

That work rate at 3.10 - still remember that recovery tackle on Hazard. And at 4.50 ish, was unfazed again by Hazard. Seems pretty decent defensively, but always using his speed to get out of those situations to begin with. Seems tough to decide if he should stick to being a RB, or a more advanced role. Didn't see enough of him on the ball and if he has the technique to even switch to the left and cut inside on his right. What you think? It seems like he's one of those super fast learners - the natural athleticism helps but also seems like he can step right into a EPL game or WC game and put a solid performance in. If he stays RB, he needs to work on deciding when to push on and make sure his positioning is good. 1 on 1 he seems fine, especially considering he was up against Hazard.

I think taking Schurrle off really caused that. He much more of a winger than Willian is and the added width stretches their back wider. Since the outside backs are pulled farther from their center backs it gives much more room for players to run or pass through their back line.

When we put in Willian (who likes to go toward the middle when he gets the ball) their back line can tighten up, and it cuts off a lot of our passing lanes.

true,RifleEyez,null,null,"it wasn't a direct quote - I think I heard it in an interview where he mentioned he wasn't even really ''aware'' of football (soccer) and still wasn't sure of his best position. could also have been a fan somewhere mentioning it too - like he started further up the pitch and then was put into RB. 

Yeah, that's what I thought. In a 3-5-2 as a fully attacking wing back. Problem is, Poch likes a 4-2-3-1 which means he's either staying as a Right Back, which is fine as he made some good tackles on Hazard and stood his ground vs him, or he's moving into the AML slot so he can cut inside onto his right foot. It's not likely he'll be moving into a more attacking role on the right side - as that's Lamela territory and you need to be left footed for that. **BUT**, [as you can see from this](http://www.thetottenhamway.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/formation-second-half-vs-Celtic.png), that's his usual tactic and Poch likes his CB's (probably why we want Musacchio as he's a ball playing CB like Vertonghen) to split, with one of the CM/DM's (Capoue) plugging the gap, which lets the Right/Left back push high up. Perfect for Yedlin, no? It's almost like a 3 at the back situation then. Lamela would be drifting inside, taking runners with him (possibly double marked if he's having a great season), with Walker/Yedlin on the overlap - so that could actually work well and how you described.

Like I said, he seems the type of dude that can look great in a standard MLS game, then put a shift in as a sub in a key game up against Hazard and then hop straight into a EPL game and put in a great shift. Seems that kinda guy - quick learner and plays to his opposition if that makes sense. Plays as well as he needs too if that makes sense. 

Really interesting to see though - he's a good prospect. I would say the only downside which sounds weird is he's 21 already, rather than 18. Which means it's a bit more pressure on him to make an impact over the next couple of years max, rather than having that 18-21 period to find his feet. I have faith in him though, and Poch is a great guy with Youth players and we have a massive schedule of games where I'm expecting Poch to start Youth players in some. We've already seen him in first team training with some of our best young prospects in pictures, so he's not the type of manager to let him rot on the bench. 

I can see the concern though for USNT fans - is this just a marketing thing to grab some Post-WC fans in Yedlin - but I don't think so. I think he really has a role to play, especially if you believe Naughton is finally disillusioned with second fiddle role to Walker and now he's not needed as LB cover.

I believe you are *trying* to be objective on the matter, but that's really impossible for either of us. To be truely objective is to have a complete understanding of the picture. This is something that nobody has. That's more of a philosophical question, however, and not really something for an in-depth discussion on /r/doctorwho.

Again, your comparison doesn't match up. Calling him ""Alex Walters"" is arbitrary: there's no precedent from the show, nobody has used it before, nobody knows who you're referring to (like it or not, when somebody says ""Doctor Who is a great guy"", you know exactly the character to whom this person is referring). However, the show had done this - intentionally, it would seem (I have a hard time believing such an error could go unnoticed for that long for such a popular show) - from the day of it's pilot and continued for some time. Producers, writers, actors, newspapers, and fans all called him Doctor Who - in certain contexts (and many times some have still).

You make the argument that he is not called this ""in show"" - this is valid. But he is also not called ""The first Doctor"" et al in the show, either. He's not ""a Doctor"" or ""my Doctor"" as an actor may put it (I would say fan, but there's a clear exception to this in *Time Crash*). As demonstrated by my example, indeed it is dissatisfactory for someone to refer to him as ""Doctor Who"" in in-show contexts. And so also for such contexts was he almost always referred to as ""The Doctor"" in the past.

Or at least be linked - not sure why. Like I said - could be the Friedel/Klinsmann/Dempsey connection but I just had this gut feeling. 

It depends how Poch likes to set up. [This is our 2nd half team vs Celtic](http://www.thetottenhamway.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/formation-second-half-vs-Celtic.png), and you can see how Poch likes to play. When I mentioned Lennon you can see he's playing where I'd expect Yedlin to play if he moved up the pitch, but Lennon isn't great there as he's a traditional winger, right wing, right footed, beat his man and cross. 

Obviously it gives us that flexibility and Yedlin seems a really dynamic player to have on the team. I'm thinking it's more likely he'll he a RB - as you can see Poch likes a 4-2-3-1, with one of the CM's dropping deeper to plug the gap (Capoue in that case, could also be Schneiderlin taking turns), which allows the 2 CB's (likely to be ball players in Musacchio and Vertonghen) to spread out and the 2 wing backs to push on. So it's *almost* like a 3-5-2, with a CM/DM dropping deeper, the 2 cb's opening up and the 2 wing backs pushing onwards with the 2 AMR/L coming inside drawing runners to them. Which seems perfect for Yedlin and his pace.

Not because it wouldn't cross the mind of the senior management - it wouldn't surprise me if it did - but because it would be impossible to keep quiet. For a start, you'd have to keep hundreds of scientists quiet and even with the most cynical view of them, you'd have to expect at least a few would have a crisis of conscious. (As it goes, every scientist I met was dead nice, and I'd be amazed if you could get more than 1 percent of them to join in a scheme like this).

Your other problem is that you have to test drugs on humans to find out whether they work. Good luck keeping the recipients of early-stage trials quiet about the miracle cure they've been given. 

Possibly they could put the kibosh on a ""miracle cure"" after the animal testing stage, but a) at that point, it isn't a miracle cure, just something with potential and b) there will still be a number of people who know what's going on and would happily lose their jobs if it meant furnishing the world with a cancer cure. Wouldn't you?

I think it would work though with the system he uses. He generally uses that setup a majority of the time, hence why we're going for Musacchio I would imagine. One of the CM/DM's drops to plug the gap, (Schneiderlin did this well) and it almost becomes a 3 at the back with the 2 full backs pushing on. That would be ideal for Yedlin especially as Lamela is likely to be ahead of him, drawing runners with him and Yedlin will be available for the overlap causing all sorts of problems (do I stick with Lamela? Do I cover the overlap? What is Eriksen/Holtby doing? What run is Soldado making?) Especially if Lamela is on fire, people will try double up on him giving Yedlin even more space to exploit on that wing. 

Inverted winger...I dunno. He's got the pace to cause problems, and he looks decent enough with the ball at his feet but even Townsend makes it look difficult as an inverted winger and he's quick as fuck, 2 footed and has quick feet. I don't want to thrust a 21 year old dude with no experience there into that position, especially if we do end up picking up a Depay type of player who would be tailor made for it.

Yedlin looked good against Hazard.

I had to sign a form to say that I was handing my case over to the MP and gave them copies of all correspondence. I got a phone call the next day and it was sorted out. 

Albeit I've had another since then but that one was followed up with a phonecall to myself before the letter about it had even reached my house. I didn't even have to provide any evidence that time (this was only last week), I was just given a call to let me know there was a sanction in place that had now been overturned. 

All due to Avanta in Middlesbrough sending my mail out either too late for me to receive it in time for appointments, or going to completely wrong addresses. 

The staff in my jobcentre itself were really helpful when it came to fighting these off. The problem however is that when the work programme send off sanction requests, they bypass your jobcentre and it goes straight to a sanction office (in my case they were all generally handled in Worcestshire, a good 200 miles away, which leaves you with contacting them via phone or snail mail).

After my appointment with the MP though, they stated that nobody comes to them with these problems and so they don't know to what extent people are suffering.",0,1407544860,null,0,false,0,cjl1eaz,t3_2cl1vq,t1_cjl1eaz,t1_cjh4ks8,null,1435146176,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"I screwed up my first year of college, ended up doing three, which wasn't such a bad thing for me because it allowed me to up my grades. I went into my final exams knowing I already had a B for Computing and a C for Physics. I think my initial problem was having set the bar too high for myself. I applied for Computer Science at York and Newcastle (Both wanting AAB and ABB respectively). I upped my grade in AS Maths from an E to an A, so I felt confident about getting the grades needed for an overall A, the other subject I ended up doing to A2 (which I initially didn't want to finish past AS) was Media Studies which I had a B for at AS. Basically, Maths was difficult, I got BDU for my final year maths exams and my final grade in A-Level maths was C, leaving me with ABCC for all my A-levels, not enough for either university—and with the knowledge that my only A-grade was Media Studies.

The funny thing about Newcastle though is they had a scheme to allow people in for lower grades if they met a criteria of basically being from a bad area or poor family, though to be accepted for that you had to make Newcastle your first choice. I opted for this originally but afterwards changed my mind because I was quite set on going to York. With the scheme, Newcastle would have accepted me with BCC instead of ABB.

When I got my results from my college website in the morning, I was shocked and upset and I rushed straight to college. I knew I hadn't got into York which I was gutted about, I didn't bother phoning them (UCAS died, when it came back up, I saw they'd straight off rejected me) I phoned Newcastle with hope but that was no good, they weren't interested either, the grades just weren't good enough. At this point, I was pretty devastated. I talked to my tutor, had a breather, decided I would use clearing—the alternative was a fourth year of college or trying to find a menial job in Hartlepool, and I just wasn't prepared to do that; I needed to feel as though I was progressing with my life.

I got on the phone and looked for every Computer Science course I could, there were quite a few but none at universities I really wanted to go to, but I was getting desperate. The problem with this all is just how hectic it is, everybody else in that boat is trying to get the same thing, a place at university. I narrowed my choices down to Stafford and Northumbria, I was on the phone to Northumbria when the call volume got too high and just as I was giving the person my details, the call went dead. I phoned Stafford, gave them my details, and was offered a place. I still tried to make contact with Northumbria, the phone line was still down, I spent a solid half hour just repeatedly phoning them, hoping I could get through to them. Eventually I managed, and I gave my details again, the person on the phone was able to confirm I had a place. Northumbria was my preference so I accepted and that was that. Stafford phoned back the next day to confirm but I turned them down.

It wasn't what I wanted, but the stress of that day was horrible, and by the end of it I was so relieved I just couldn't stop smiling. Having a university place at that point just felt like bliss. But the pangs of disappointment were there, I really felt I missed out by not getting my choices. In a way it was a gamble, I knew an AAB would be very hard to get, and I knew ABB wouldn't be much easier. I was hoping I wouldn't have to use clearing, and honestly that gamble very nearly didn't pay off.

And how's that all worked out for me? I spent a fair while complaining about aspects of my course that I don't like, and I spent just as long listening to friends who attend York and Newcastle complaining about theirs; clearly none of them are perfect. But even though I didn't get what I wanted, it has worked out well for me. I find that Northumbria's approach to learning is more work-orientated, so it's about developing skills for work which suits me better. My course is a 4-year sandwhich course, and I've had the opportunity to work abroad for a year at a rather prominent physics laboratory—an opportunity I doubt I would have had doing a three-year course at York or Newcastle.

I've just finished my work placement and I have my final year of studies ahead of me. I've fucked things up and I have regrets, but I'm happy where I am now. I've had great opportunity to learn skills in work, and I'll be able to finish my degree and stand a good chance of gaining employment afterwards.",0,1407545049,null,0,1407545282,0,cjl1har,t3_2d0ln8,t1_cjl1har,t3_2d0ln8,null,1435146221,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

But i genuinely think that Rodriguez and Schneiderlin are two of ""Poch's guys""....Schneiderlin is clearly very high on playing under Poch again and it sounds like Rodriguez is as well. 

Word is that Rodriguez is a workout machine that Poch loves, one of those first in/last out guys that is constantly working to get better and when Poch got to Soton the two really clicked. I was reading somewhere this week that Rodriguez's vertical leap improved some huge amount in the short period of time he was with Poch. Even the Soton board you see people talking about how hard Rodriguez has been working on his rehab and is just blowing people away with the dedication and improvement he has been showing.  I just think he is a guy that Poch genuinely seems to like whether people think he is worth the money or not.

I think the catch on the deal with the two was in a way that we were trying to let Soton be able to win some PR points.  We could pay something like £30m - £35m for the two of them and Soton could claim we paid £27m for Schneiderlin and that they let Rodriguez go on the cheap because of the injury and contract when in truth the pricing would probably be somewhere in between for both.

Then i think when all of the Soton supporters as well as the media and the general public (as well as Koeman's tweets) went apeshit over the Chambers sale they scrambled to save face....problem is that it didn't really save them any face and now Schneiderlin is pissed that he didn't get them move he wanted. Rodriguez i think is fine with waiting until January because he needs to settle his health....but Schneiderlin wants the move and knows if he isn't playing he won't be getting any looks for the FFF (with a match in September), so he is working to get his move by hook or by crook now.",0,1407546282,null,0,false,0,cjl207g,t3_2d0p37,t1_cjl207g,t1_cjl0qly,null,1435146461,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

true,scwol,cnty-uk,Somerset in Scotland,"I went through clearing last year, after arsing up my exams (ABCD, first choice was A*AAA) due to lack of revision and through sheer dumb luck ended up in Glasgow, an ancient Russell Group university that was rated third in the country for my subject. 

Going in to second year I wouldn't transfer to my first or insurance (Imperial or Warwick) if you paid me.

I'm not exaggerating when I say that A Level results day was the worst day of my life so far. Waking up to an email from UCAS at 8am that essentially says 'You've failed and nobody wants you' is soul destroying. Still had to trek into college to see just how badly I'd failed - I'd heard it's always worth ringing if you're a only a grade or so away. Maybe I could still get in? Then there's the second crushing disappointment when I realised that not only have I definitely missed out on  my choices, but my grades are so low I'd have to drastically lower my expectations of the sort of University I could attend.
 
By now I was fairly despondent, faced with a choice between East Basingstoke Metropolitan University or repeating the last 12 months of my life under twice the pressure I was before. 

I'm a bit sketchy on the times, but from what I can remember results were given out from 9am, and clearing didn't open until 10am. My college had a Clearing room set up, with phones, computers and Telegraphs along with some teachers  to offer advice. I  spent the worst part of an hour flicking through the Telegraph's clearing tables and, when it was accessible, the UCAS site. None of the options seemed particularly appealing, not helped by the occasional uni I'd visited and disliked appearing in the list - campuses of sixties concrete monstrosities, not so much a gender ratio as a gender (in the singular) and all set against a backdrop of some dull uninspiring town or miserable suburb. If those places were in clearing, then presumably the rest were along similar lines.

I half-heartedly googled some of the options, not really liking what I saw before returning to the list to scroll past a few more. I was surprised by the amount of choices which was the only thing keeping me going - the small glimmer that one of the choices was nice.

The turning point was coming across Royal Holloway in the list. This was a good university, with a nice campus and close to London, an interesting place to live. It's not particularly well known for my subject but it's a respected institution where you could be confident of a good course. I started to be more thorough, properly checking the ones I knew little about and eventually came to Glasgow. Ancient, Russell Group, the stunning Gothic main building, ranked highly in the league tables -  not the best reasons to choose a university, but given the circumstances I was pretty pleased.  There was the nerve-wracking phone call to their admissions department at 10am on the dot, asking if they still had places, reading my grades (which were still something of a raw wound) over the phone, and then the greatest rush of relief I have ever felt as he told me there and then I could have a place. 

Accommodation can be a nightmare after clearing - it's possible you've already missed out on halls by the time all the paperwork has gone through, but I wouldn't let that put you off too much. Unless it's nigh on certain you'll get in to you first choice, and providing you are absolutely set on your first choice, I don't think resitting is a good option. There's no guarantee you won't end up in the same place 12 months down the line. 

tl;dr: Clearing is hell but it's possible to do very well out of it and resitting will rarely be worth it.

Top 7:

1. Chelsea

2. City

3. United

4. Arsenal

5. Liverpool

6. Everton

7. Spurs

...

Bottom Three:

18. Leicester

19. West Brom

20. Burnley

FA Cup: City

League Cup: Arsenal (just so that I can laugh at Gooners talking about how important it is.)

Champions League: Chelsea (Mourinho is European Champion; a Special One.)

CL Finalist: Bayern.

CL Semifinalists: Real, City.

Golden Boot: RvP or Aguero; whoever stays healthy.

Player of the Year: Hazard.

Assist Leader: Fabregas.

Chelsea attacker stats (PL):

 - Costa: 15 goals, 3 assists.

 - Drogba: 5 goals, 2 assists.

 - Torres: 4 goals, 4 assists. (12 goals in Cup games against random League Two teams.)

 - Hazard: 19 goals, 11 assists.

 - Schürrle: 8 goals, 5 assists

 - Willian: 5 goals, 6 assists

 - Salah: 3 goals, 2 assists

 - Oscar: 4 goals, 9 assists

 - Fabregas: 7 goals, 13 assists

Bonus predictions:

 - Cesc gets into a fight with Jack Wilshere, and hits him--with celery. Drogba scores 2 more while this happens.

 - Champions League Quarter-finals: Chelsea vs. Barcelona. Messi, Suarez, and Neymar run into each other several times, and don't get a shot on target. Ivanovic scores one of the goals, and proceeds to bite Suarez in his celebration. Even Torres scores. 9-0 on aggregate.

 - In a blind fit of rage, van Gaal rips off Rooney's hair implants and proceeds to bicycle-kick it into the net to prove a point. No one is sure what the point actually is.

 - Arsenal is 7th with 4 games to play, and they fire Arséne Wenger. They replace him with David Moyes, who revolutionizes the game with a groundbreaking goalkeeper-less 3-7-1 formation. They win the last 4 games by large margins and get their traditional 4th-Place-Trophy.

However, it is the massive amounts of safety testing which cost so much money and carry big risks. Once you have ""designed"" a drug, you still have 99% of the hard work still to do. You need to demonstrate efficacy and safety on many, many scales. Then you need licensing, all the paperwork and all the manufacturing capabilities to be compliant with an absolute shitload of legislation.

The simplest proof I can offer is that cancer is not one disease. Breast cancer has recently been categorised as at least 10 different diseases.

Each one benefits from a different treatment regime.

Increasingly we are realising that diseases are not homogenous. They are highly variable. In fact, some leading researchers are now saying that we should move away from the whole ""tissue of origin"" definitions for cancer. Saying ""lung cancer"" is totally meaningless. Maybe that was the tissue of origin, but it's usually the metastasis that kills you.

I work in this area, so maybe I can provide some useful opinion. This is a latest generation antibody-drug conjugate (basically a guided drug, using a specific antibody to target to tumours). It's an awesome technology which will hopefully result in highly targeted anti-cancer drug delivery. Part of the reason why chemo is so terrible is because it affects all sorts of cells in the body, and not just the cancer cells. This family of drugs specifically target certain cancers. So in theory, one day in the future you may get cancer, it can be genetically profile and then you will get the exact drug you need coupled to an antibody which delivers it to ONLY the tumour and nothing else. You could have almost no side effects.

As a result

1) These drugs are incredibly expensive to design, test and manufacture. They are highly complex. The cost will not really come down unless we loosen the standards for drug testing, safety analysis and manufacture.

2) The market for these drugs is actually quite small. Antibodies are highly specific, but cancers are very very different to each other. It seems to be that there is no specific target that is generic to every cancer cell. That means that 100 difference cancers might need 100 different drugs. And each drug needs the same R&amp;D, safety analysis, manufacturing scrutiny etc. From the drug companies point of view, it would be better to release another generic (but less effective) anti-cancer drug which can kill lots of cancers. Then it's only one drug and one set of expenses.

So there's a balance to be had. Clearly 90 grand is an outrageous sum of money for a few extra months of life (which is not guaranteed of course). But IMO it's also very impressive that such a drug exists in the first place. These companies do need to be able to make profit in order to continue developing more drugs - especially with newer technologies like this one. If nobody can (or will) pay for it, we do risk stifling drug discovery.

I'm not saying we should feel sorry for Roche or worry that they are not making enough money. Rather, they will design drugs according to the market for selling them. If it happens that targeted drugs for breast cancer simply becomes unprofitable, they will focus on something else which might be less ""important"" but more profitable. A single penis enlargement pill would make more money than 100 highly targeted anti-cancer drugs. Therefore we do need there to be sufficient financial incentive for companies to keep tackling very difficult areas such as cancer.

As we understand more about cancer, drugs are going to keep costing more and more. We now know that ""breast cancer"" is actually at least 10, and probably hundreds of different diseases. Each version has a different cause, different age of onset, different rate of progression, different level of metastasis, AND each benefits from a different treatment. So now we don't need one drug for breast cancer. We probably need 100 drugs. And let's not even consider that cancers actually mutate and become resistant to treatments over time. So that means we now need 100 drugs between all breast cancer patients. Each drug still has to go through R&amp;D, safety testing etc, but now the potential market size is much smaller because the drug only works against one specific subtype of cancer.

For most of us, lie detector tests are pretty much a coin toss - maybe we pass, maybe we fail, but in scientific tests with proper controls it simply doesn't correlate with the truth. But sociopaths are pretty good at *reliably* beating lie detector tests, and sex offenders are obviously likely to have no empathy for their victims - ie to be sociopaths.

This is potentially a very good way to create a false sense of security - to give the impression that the offenders aren't interested in re-offending when they very much are.

Anyone wrongly convicted of a sex offense and with no intention of ever committing one is probably more likely to fail the test than those sociopaths with every intention of committing more sex crimes.

&gt; The Ministry of Justice's enthusiasm for polygraph machines follows a successful trial report in 2012 which concluded that it ""increased the chances that a sexual offender under supervision in the community will reveal information relevant to their management, supervision, treatment, or risk assessment"".

That above from the article is about the only positive thing - for now, it can help prevent crime because the criminals are ignorant - they can be fooled into revealing information. But a less ignorant criminal could just as easily exploit this to build credibility for lies. One problem with policing based on a bluff is that sometimes, the criminals will be a better bluffers than the police.

The League itself been fucking over Celtic (and Oldco) for years and years and years and years in terms of taking that revenue away, and making them settle for pennies on one of the biggest teams in the English Language market. You can argue both ways on the issue, which is why a lot of fans seem torn between ""Scotland"" or ""Another league and/or Super League"" or ""TV Rights"" and ""Wanting to actually do well on a world stage and manage expectations"". 

Other than switching leagues, it's the only way this team can live up to some of the expectations this fan base has, which are still astronomical compared to the financial state of the Scottish game.

true,kanaku,tennant,Tennant,"The minecrafter example does not really hold up. You basically ruin that example yourself by saying that he only exists in his universe. In his universe he is called the Doctor. The minecrafter exists in both the world of minecraft and the real world, thus making both of his names relevant and accurate.

Here is a much better example. My real name is James and I go by Jimmy. It is very common for people named James to go by Jim. I have never gone by that nickname and do not associate myself with it. If someone refers to me as Jim because they saw my name was James, it would probably be accepted as okay by the general public. However, that does not make it right to refer to me as Jim. That is not my name. In actuality, calling me Jim is the same as calling me Howard; even though many people would think it is okay to refer to me as such.

As for the numbering of the Doctor, I would have agreed with you about a year ago. Things changed when Moffat wrote Clara calling Matt Smith the 11th Doctor though. We can disagree or agree with how that was handled, but the fact of the matter is that it's in his hands right now to decide what is true and untrue. It personally didn't bother me. When the face and personality of a character changes, and that mechanic is actually part of the show; it kinda makes sense in my opinion to put a number to the face. This is not a point I would have argued over though. It was way too loose before Moffat made it canon.

Personally I don't see anything wrong with a little bit of philosophical talk on /r/doctorwho. It's nice to have something besides constant fangirl screams on this subreddit. Yes, I do know this probably would be better suited for /r/gallifrey though.

My theory on how calling him ""Doctor Who"" started and stuck, puts cross-hairs on ignorant media and people who do not know much about the show. They see the title, probably know that the Doctor is very mysterious, and run with it. It's very common to name a show the name of the main character anyway. I do realize that people within the shows staff (old and new who) are guilty of this as well. I do not believe that makes it right however. If it is something born out of tradition, that does not make it valid either.

It may not have been his fault, as he was relegated to the left back position for a good chunk of the season, but it was still a disappointment. Hopefully he can rebound this season and earn back the praise so many spurs fans bestowed upon him in his first season.  
  
Roberto Soldado  
Soldado is a tough one to figure out. He had an incredible scoring record in Spain for Valencia, but he failed to carry that over to England in his first season with Tottenham. There are many theories add to why he scored such a low amount of goals from open play, and I'm not going to say which is most likely and which is complete hogwash, but I can say that expectations for Roberto this year are that he'll come good.

A modern drug costs about $1.15bn to bring to market according to the industry and while I think they have got their sums wrong and should claim it is more like $800m, we don't have any serious disagreement that it is 'a lot of money'. Most of this cost is in jumping over regulatory hurdles and paying the salary of people who discovered the drug (and then a huge whack for marketing and lobbying) - the former of which are absolutely indispensable in the discovery of a modern innovative product.

So in my mind, there's no way innovative drugs would be discovered and proved to be safe if you took away the patent system, unless you VASTLY expanded the reach of the government and essentially nationalised the pharmaceutical sector. Presumably you think differently (you're not claiming new drugs are unimportant). Could you give me a rough idea how drug development would be paid for if there was no expectation of selling the drug at the end?

This will just fuel the ISIS propaganda machine and allow it to gain more credibility and funding with those who have a fear of Christianity and the West.

true,WhyThatsJustSilly,null,null,"Around this time last year, I wrote a letter to say goodbye to Liverpool and the fans after I joined Napoli. Some people asked why I was doing it when I was only going on loan for a season and would be back within twelve months but the reality was that it was already clear to me that my time at Anfield was over. Liverpool had signed Simon Mignolet to be their new number one and I was being allowed to go out on loan so I wanted to take the opportunity to offer my thanks and bid farewell because I knew that I would not be back.

I suppose this is a bit of an update now that my departure has been confirmed and I want to take the opportunity to thank everyone at Liverpool – and I mean everyone – for everything that they have done for me over years. Last time, some of my words were misinterpreted and taken out of the context in which they were meant but it would never be my intention to leave Liverpool on anything but good terms so hopefully this will put that right once and for all.

I have been extremely fortunate to spend so many years at what I consider to be one of the greatest clubs in world football. It has been an honour and a privilege. The memories I have of Anfield, my team mates, the supporters and the people of Liverpool will stay with me forever. I am disappointed that I am leaving but only in the sense that I enjoyed being at the club so much and it is always difficult to say goodbye to something that is special to you. I will always be grateful to have played for Liverpool and my time at the club was always going to come to an end so we move on with no hard feelings.

All I can do now is look forward to a new adventure at Bayern Munich and being reunited with Pep Guardiola, who was my first captain at Barcelona. Hopefully I will enjoy being with them as much as I enjoyed being with Liverpool and again, I am fortunate to be going from one great club to another. I will return to at Anfield some time soon, though, only next time it will be as a fan rather than a player and I hope that when I do come back Liverpool will be challenging for the biggest trophies like they always should.

The final thing for me to do is to express my gratitude to everyone who has supported me in any way since I joined Liverpool in 2005 – all of the managers who I have played under, all of the players who I shared a dressing room with, all of the staff who helped me in so many ways and every single one of the fans who gave the team and myself the kind of backing that others can only dream of. I count myself as a Liverpudlian and I will be one for life.

The only thing you've linked to agrees 100% to what I said, unless you're being daft and saying oil doesn't count. As for the unassigned portion of GDP, it's a red herring as far as I can see. You've claimed elsewhere it is 4% and all is from rUK; I doubt that but we can assume it's true for this:

4% of GDP (about £1.7T iirc) is £68b

£68b divided by population in rUK (lets say 57million) is £1,192 extra GDP per head.

And many of their arguments are just and well reasoned, often however I find they lack an appreciation for larger global implications.

&gt;Also, Western news media is just as much loaded with propaganda as any other.

It is, although I take the comment **brutal** to be a touch crass and unnecessary.

&gt;Are you saying it wasn't brutal?

Well yes there is a very good argument for it. If you took look at all world conflicts over this century and consider their aims and achieved objectives against civilian and combatant deaths, I think you would find all these recent conflicts have been relatively bloodless.

If Scots then want to build a make-or-break economy on oil alone good luck. The fledgling Scots economy would then have to deal with the downside of being propped up by UK public sector jobs... Significantly higher pension liabilities.

The hard truth, the truth I hope comes out more publicly after Scots vote No is that Scotland is economically propped up by the rUK, and by the SE of England in particular. Any notion that the Scots could be wealthier independents is absurd in the short-mid term.

For these qualities depend on inculcating respect, trust, and openness among the members of the armed forces at all levels, and this is the marching music of modern warfare that Arab armies, no matter how much they emulate the corresponding steps, do not want to hear.*

Wow.  Haven't the left and libertarians been saying this for decades, and been dismissed as conspiracists and worse?  Of course these are resource wars, but I don't see how this makes the claim that it benefits everyone on the planet, and how only someone on the moon could think otherwise.  At best, it benefits those who get the resources, and harms those who lose them - which largely means the elites of the resource-rich nations and the West benefit, and the poor of the world are harmed.  At worst, it means we continue our dependency on fossil carbons until we drive the planet over an ecological cliff or blow ourselves up.

&gt;I know I didn't support any of my claims mainly because I am lazy but that doesn't sound right to me. Laser guide munitions and gps cruise missiles and we are killing more civilians? Doesn't work out does it.

In an unchecked world without a global superpower Iran and Iraq might have grow rich acquired nukes wiped each other out, wiped Israel out, taken over all of Saudis Oil fields, god knows what, the cultural psyche is still very uneducated in the middle east. Granted wealth would bring with it education but do you honestly think education would have prevailed? Imperialism is a nasty concept but often it breeds a better world.

&gt;A further cause of the rising death toll for civilians is that most contemporary conflicts are not between States, but within them. Rather than being set-piece battles between contending armies, these are much more complex affairs—struggles between the military and civilians, or between contending groups of armed civilians.

I think perhaps the number are skewed by civil wars and such, I could be wrong but the number I hear flying about just seem crazy. It hard to get an accurate measurement in regions where civil war are common and death is an everyday occurrence. An interest measure might be the US invasion of Iraq against ISIS invasion, although I am sure there are problems in directly comparing two.

There I had chances to travel the world, work in different countries, make friends who were just there because they liked the subject not because they wanted to all be doctors (i.e. they were more interesting), learn lots of applicable skills and generally get to be quite clever.

Got first class degree in astrophysics,  took a year out doing this and that, felt ready to have another stab at medicine. By ready I mean academically but also mindset,  I'd looked at other things I could do with my life, other paths I could take and decided the one I was on originally really was the best.


Loved my 4 years in Liverpool - I went from a stuck up teenager who thought the world owed me everything to someone ready to work for what I wanted.  I've just finished my first week as a doctor working in the NHS.

true,Froolow,null,null,"I've read that book! I remember being pretty impressed with the argument overall, but thinking that it fell short in the pharma sector because the author didn't properly explain what was supposed to drive innovation (implicitly, I think, the assumption was that the government would beef up the role of drug discovery)

Their key empirical point is that Italy was very innovative at a time when it had no patent protection, but I think this is a weak argument; they point out in a later paragraph that every OTHER country respected international patents, so any NCE discovered in Italy could be patented everywhere else; there was only a very weak reason not to base your sector of the industry there. Any unilateral patent agreement (except maybe in the US) wouldn't disrupt the sector, as far as I can see, although it might well have negative knock-on effects in other ways (e.g. trade sanctions)

Their key theoretical point seems to be that a social discount rate of 5% is sufficient to make patents unattractive. Here I think they are being wilfully ignorant of the literature of social discount rates; *nobody* thinks the rate should be greater than 5%, and yet they present this claim as though it is so small as to be almost a given. The true rate of social discounting is probably around 3.5%, and might be as low as 1.5% (admittedly the US experimented for a while with a 6% rate, but that was during the Cold War when a high social discount rate was more understandbale than now).

That seems like an interesting idea. Perhaps this follow me everywhere type service BT always talked about way back, where your landline was also your mobile. I think the idea back then was it'd be a DECT/GSM device and would switch depending on where you are. Good luck getting an iPhone to do that!

It's Torres playing over Ba last Season in the lonely striker position, that was the problem that I still do not fully understand.

The only time in recent memory when Torres actually played well was when he used to drop back with Mata, I actually didn't mind that Torres because as poor as he is up front as a lonely striker, he's still pretty good with the ball at his feet and his passing is actually better than what most people think (some of his assists to Mata used to amazing actually).

The only reason a Manager would play a poor player continuously IMO is down to a contract agreement i.e. x amount of starts/minutes per Season. 

I know the old rumour of Torres being Roman's toy is thrown about a lot, but from a Business POV, it just doesn't make sense.

Why Torres wasn't converted to an attacking midfielder earlier on is a bit weird in my eyes, because he indirectly used to play that role and he was damn good at it.

That BT service was actually launched, it was some custom Motorola Razr thatused Bluetooth in the house and GSM outside. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BT_Fusion - maybe they'll relaunch the brand if they do this.

As for the iPhone, people seem to think it will do ""wifi calling"" in iOS 8. I hope this is some sort of standards compliant thing, rather than (like with voicemail and visual voicemail) it's Apple forcing the networks to do their proprietary crap. 

UMA is a standard that does exactly this (wifi at home, hands over to GSM/UMTS) but it was never very well adopted by the networks and the manufacturers. In the UK I think it was really only RIM and Orange who bothered.

I'd have thought BT could pull off the IP side pretty well. They have complete control over QoS from the home hub to the VoIP network, and more people can get some form of fibre service so bandwidth isn't an issue.

true,mmmmmh,null,null,"&gt; You didn't do anything to be British apart from being born.

I agree with idea I did nothing to be born British, but by being a part of British society, voting, jury duty, reciprocating and propagating mannerisms, mindset and courtesies that are part of British culture, I contribute to being British. 

I think the element your missing is assuming being British just means being born somewhere. There's more to ""British"" than just being born there, British is a culture and a mindset that's created by the people who were born in Britain, ourselves included

So whilst it's pointless being proud of being born somewhere, I'm incredibly proud that the place I was born and the other people born here work together to create the British culture, image and lifestyle (which is something to be proud of because of how highly we rank, and how pleasant it is). For example, if I was born in China, or some middle eastern countries or maybe even America (and somehow had the same personality and views) I wouldn't be proud to be Chinese or Eastern, because I don't personally agree with the attitudes and mindsets and cultures of those places.

As an aside, I fully appreciate I didn't do anything to be born here, and that's why I'm all for an incredibly open a lenient immigration policy for those who want to be a part of a contribute to being British. Why should I get all these nice things and a comfy life, yet someone who, through no fault of their own, was born somewhere else doesn't get the same?

true,mmmmmh,null,null,"&gt; The way I see it, it's patriotic attitudes that lead to xenophobia, racism, and war. 

It doesn't have to. It's possible to be proud of something, but not insist everyone else complies or copies. It's also possible to be patriotic, but not blindly patriotic.

&gt;  It's like having religion, but for a country rather than a god.

That's a broad statement. My issue with religion is people blindly following something, insisting other should follow to, with no objective reason other than an old book said so. See my other comment above for a few justifications as to why we should be proud to be British.

&gt; We're meant to look at these people who represent our country - the royals, the military, sportspeople, the rich and powerful, and even politicians - and consider them our betters, and feel a sense of pride for them. And get all emotional and overprotective over some mere flags.

It's possible to be proud and patriotic but disagree with some things. You're right, it's ridiculously pointless to blindly praise anything for no objectively justifiable reason. But as I said, I don't support our royals, I think a lot of our politicians are idiots too. But being British is more than just the behaviours of a few people in power. And in some cases, although I disagree with the attitudes and personalities of some people in power, the people in power have facilitated the society (and all it's successes and failures) we have today. As I said, at least IMO, our society compared to the majority of other countries is something to be envied.

&gt; All of which is just a complete load of shit that I desire no part in.

Whilst I disagree with your opinion, I'll defend to the death your right to say it, because that's just one of the many niceties of Britain. In other countries, you could be heavily prosecuted for saying such a thing;)",0,1407587872,null,0,1407588100,0,cjld9pb,t3_2czom2,t1_cjld9pb,t1_cjky9e9,null,1435151934,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

 I mean some Newcastle fans honestly think they're as good as us? Everyone knows the whole Lukaku to Newcastle shenanigans that they made us citing ""we could surely compete with a team like Everton were surely a better prospect"" and of course the white haired cunt who's obsessed with us, I actually wouldn't be surprised if he was a regular visitor on here.

With Spurs I wouldn't hate them so much if the club didn't act like they're title contenders. We don't act like we are even though we are better than them. Spurs spend huge amounts of money on mostly no bodies and it's always the managers fault when it doesn't work out and they don't get champions league. It's like Stoke sacking Mark Hughes because he didn't finish second, like it's not going to happen. It's just a poorly run club in my opinion.

Now Arsenal... I actually used to quite like the club but the fans are definitely some of the most deluded bunch around numerous times last season arguments thrown around like ""Ramsey is better than Xavi"" ""Flamini is the best holding mid in the premier league and one of the best in the world"" and of course ""we have the league wrapped up already"" (December-ish) They're honestly just annoying fans really. 

I mean people call us stupid because we say we have the best fullbacks in the league, one of the best keepers, best young striker possibly in the world and England's future captain in Stones and England's arguably best player in Ross. 

There has been proof of most of these maybe in exception to Stones because we can't really prove that now but Seamus best right back last year, I don't care what you say Baines was easily the best left back last year but the Shaw hype train got him in the TOTS, our keeper set a record at the World Cup finals for most saves and has been consistently good for a number of years, Rom is on par or better I don't know when Aguero for amount of goals by 21 and I think he held the record he is by far the best young striker in the league I can't say in the world because I don't honestly know. Of course Stones could be the future captain he has already talked about captaining us one day so why not England? And then were at Ross, you can see he's by far England's greatest young player at the moment and he was for some reason not being utilised at the World Cup. His biggest competition is probably Sterling who is a bit off him in my opinion but not by much (if you're going to say I'm wrong by citing stats, Sterling was playing with the 2 best strikers in the league last season so he will obviously have more goals and assists than Barkley)

That's my piece really and I know you said not to but special mention to United because they think Januzaj is better than Ross and despite they're arguments come the end of the season they are buying their final position now which make them no better than City or Chelsea also I actually like City, they bring in likeable players and take away from Arsenal and fans accept they're buying the league but don't really care!",0,1407588823,null,0,false,0,cjldh94,t3_2d1mks,t1_cjldh94,t3_2d1mks,null,1435456654,9,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,9

edit:
BR has to convince everyone at the club that his vision is the right one and the players have to buy into that, Gerrard did because he saw the improvements on his declining ability, Skrtel and Carra adopted it, Suarez/Sturridge/Coutinho/Hendo/Sterling etc. have all had massive improvements in their careers under him. Reina however declined and he was unwilling to put in massive work to improve and didn't believe in BR vision either because his best years were under Rafa. The more players BR brings in the more the club will align with his plans and vision for the future and the less friction we will have in the dressing rooms. That's why we use so much of our effort in bringing in younger players, they are willing to adapt and change as the style changes whereas you can't teach Mata and Ozil to defend the way Coutinho and Sterling did when they stepped up.",0,1407589295,null,0,1407589781,0,cjldl69,t3_2d28dx,t1_cjldl69,t3_2d28dx,null,1435152010,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

When I signed up a woman helped me thorugh the process and it was painless. Three customer support gave me a discount on my monthly bill and gave me beta access to a app that allows me to make calls and texts over WiFi because my signal was poor at home.

Is the coverage as bad as it used to be? I don't know - I've been with Three for 8 months. But, recently they started a partnership with EE where they share mast locations and backhaul, meaning three and EE's coverage is pretty similar.

OpenSignal says that Three has the second best service in the UK after EE.

I had tried GiffGaff and left them because of their bad signal, Three was much better in my city. It could be different in your city.

The coverage tracker is quite accurate, go to where you will use your phone on the tracker. If it is only just covered by Outside only, chances are you won't get a signal. If it is only just covered by indoor only you will get a signal outside but likely won't inside. The tracker is accurate, but a little too generous to the signal.

true,ninereeds314,null,null,"There's a reason it's called an *autonomic* stress response - these things are measuring rapid stress reactions that are difficult to suppress. The stress response can activate before your conscious mind is even aware of the trigger - stimuli such as a persons tone of voice or facial expression get significant interpretation in the amygdala which also triggers the stress response, before the prefrontal cortex even knows about them.

Also, one theory is that if there's no sign of stress at all, that just proves you're suppressing the stress response to hide lies - which is difficult for most people, but not as difficult as faking credible stress responses to suggest truth-telling.

The problem with lie detectors is that the stress response can be triggered by a lot of things such as e.g. feeling accused. They go on about control questions, but of course being asked your name doesn't tend to trigger a stress response - that doesn't mean that being asked about some crime won't make innocent people feel accused, scared, angry or whatever, triggering that stress response.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"It's not as black and white as that. Even if we ignore that though, you'll probably find Scottish concessions on oil income would be part of some kind of broader currency sharing  agreement. What defeats me in these sort of 'debates' is how Scots make sweeping proclamations about what's rightfully theirs and how much they are entitled to... Yet don't seem to appreciate that their bargaining position is deceptively weak, because Westminster holds almost all the cards. Whereas Westminster can leverage the Scots on all sorts of things from borders to currency, the Scots only really have oil and the ability to be a dick about HMNB Clyde. It strikes me, in the unlikely event of a yes vote, the Scots are going to get absolutely asset stripped by both the City of London speculating and exploiting the situation, and Westminster - which would likely be a conservative government voted in by a jilted British public on a mandate of ""don't give an inch"" negotiating. They'll also have the backing of an international community which will sooner work with it's established UK connections than take a chance on a new state whose long term success and reliability is uncertain.

Yes yes, the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea... legal this and legal that. But in reality, ""legal"" means one thing within a country, and another thing between countries. The law between countries and documents like the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea are not as straightforward and difficult to enforce. Even taking the matter to the International Court of Justice could literally take decades. The easiest way for the Scots to access oil profits is through negotiating - which will mean compromising their strong position in order to make up for shortcomings elsewhere, on issues like currency.

The fact is, the evidence shows they make people say honest truths that they might have (illegally/wrongly) withheld. So they're using them to evoke the truth.
 
Although that only happens because they're relying on people's belief that the tests are accurate, despite them not being treated by the authorities as if they're accurate.

In some warped way it's similar to standing next to them with a baseball bat saying they'll get a beating if they're not honest. Even though they have no intentions of conducting the beating, the person is still stressed into telling the truth because they fear of lying.

Maybe, instead of complaining so much and blaming 'aristocracy' for your problems, look at yourself and figure out what you want to do.

It's literally never gonna happen, to the point it's not even a 0.0005% chance - it's not even on the same level as the ''Baldini/Roma/Lamela'' connection - but it would be fucking hilarious just for the reactions. Would be a perfect signing nontheless though, but I've come to terms with Musacchio. 

When you look back at Baldini's signings though - he's actually made some CRACKING deals and picked up players from obscurity that have gone on to become legendary. For people who don't know, here's the deals he made at his old clubs. I don't think this is all of them, but still. Many of them were 16-22 age. 

**Roma**

Marcus Assuncao, Hidetoshi Nakata, Cristano Zanetti (aged 22), Emerson, Walter Samuel (aged 22), Antonio Cassano (aged 18), Daniele De Rossi (aged 18), Cristian Chivu, Phillipe Mexes, Gabriel Batistuta, Pep Guardiola, Christian Panucci, Vincenzo Montella,

**Real Madrid**

Fernando Gago, Gonzalo Higuain (aged 18), Marcelo, Fabio Cannavaro, Ruud Van Nistelrooy, Emerson

**Roma again**

Marquinhos (at PSG now), Pjanic, Kjaer, Gago, Osvaldo, Krkic, Lamela, Borriello, Stekelenburg

I wouldn't mind us dropping 5-10m on a few youngsters - especially if it's just compo fees or future clauses. I want Tielemans, Praet and Iseka from Anderlecht, Ali Adnan at Rizepor, Mastour at AC, Balanta, Driussi, Agustín Allione, Gomez at Argentinos, Mosquito &amp; Nathan at Paranaense (2nd best player at the U17 WC - both would be a great deal, like a Fabio/Rafael deal Utd made), Zivkovic at Parizan and the other Živković in Holland, Iheanacho, Taye Academy (linked to Arsenal -  six goals and bagged seven assists at U17 WC for nigeria). Sound like FM type of signings, right? But watch them if you can - they're all IRL massively gifted. I watched quite a lot of U17 tournaments and stuff...oh and Wilson from Liverpool, Patrick Roberts/Dembele from Fulham, but that will cost a LOT.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"As I said to you, several times now, you are basing everything on a large **assumption** that the majority of the oil revenue will belong to the new Scottish nation. Now, whilst Alex Salmond has said it will (lets face it, he says a lot of things) you'll notice that nobody in the UK government has actually backed that up in any meaningful way. Most sources agree there is certainly a case for the Scots **making claim** to the oil, but in reality the industry was developed with money from the entirety of the UK and in particular the City of London. There is also an assumption that a geographical share along the fisheries median line might be used, but that is also an assumption and infact it would be totally reasonable for both parties to agree any manner of division. In reality, most sources ([like the FT](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5b3f779a-9d4e-11e3-83c5-00144feab7de.html#axzz39txGzDAR)) now seem to agree the likely outcome would be that the Scots would negotiate most oil profits away in exchange for concessions from the rUK on things like a formal currency sharing agreement which will arguably be more important to them simply to function on international markets. 

Scotland isn't Norway. They don't have anywhere near the oil reserves, and they have to contest the oil with another nation that is 10 times their size. Now, I know your little tartan fingers are just itching to tell me about the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and all that tosh - but the bottom line is, if the Scots want to take that approach they'll need to go through the International Court of Justice which could take decades. This view has [been supported by academics](http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/scottish-independence-legal-warning-over-north-sea-1-3105828).

In reality, if by some surprise Scots do vote yes, then instead of proclaiming to the rUK what is and isn't their, they'll actually have to start doing this thing called negotiating - and their position is deceptively weak. Scots can only really ply pressure on the rUK with the pleasures of oil profits or the pains of HMNB Clyde. On the latter, they are actually between a rock and a hard place since the US/NATO will likely ply just about as much pressure as they can (financial, political etc.) on the new Scottish state as possible to ensure the British strategic nuclear deterrent remains, and will also probably push for a strong Royal Navy presence operating out of ""Scottish waters"" for the strategic [GIUK gap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIUK_gap)... My guess is the Scots would have to accept some kind of UK Sovereign Overseas Territory - probably with a commitment to making it nominally ""shared"" (though effectively Royal Navy run) within a period of say 10-20 years. There may then be some further vague commitment to diminishing the nuclear storage and maintenance facility over a much longer timescale. 

So... that leaves Scotland with oil. That's their single big ticket bargaining chip... and with shale gas going the way it is, it might not even be that big of a bargaining chip. 

So, let me reiterate;

* Scottish GDP per capita is not higher than the rUK contrary to what several sources suggest including the ONS and Gers. It isn't that the statistics are wrong, it's just they are not accurate in this situation since they were not collected in such a way as to accurately guage Scottish GDP.

true,Matt5327,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"&gt;he minecrafter example does not really hold up. You basically ruin that example yourself by saying that he only exists in his universe. In his universe he is called the Doctor. The minecrafter exists in both the world of minecraft and the real world, thus making both of his names relevant and accurate.

Nothing close. Many youtubers play a ""character"" on their channel. Look at their earliest to latest videos and you can see how it developed. We're not discussing the youtuber's ""real life name"" in my example. We're discussing his IGN (say, Guude), vs the name on is youtube account (GuudeBoulderFist).

&gt; In actuality, calling me Jim is the same as calling me Howard

Despite the fact that Doctor Who isn't a nickname, your example still doesn't hold. It may be *impolite* for someone to refer to you as Jim after finding out you'd really not prefer that, but that doesn't make it *wrong* (wrong meaning incorrect, rather than morals/ethics/etc.). Someone says Jim, you, and others, will probably understood who is being talked about if there's no other James or Jimmys in the room (which is reasonable for your comparison, as there are no other ""Doctors"" or ""Doctor Whos"").

&gt;Things changed when Moffat wrote Clara calling Matt Smith the 11th Doctor though.

This is fair, I had forgotten about that. But let me ask you hypothetical question. Say, in *Deep Breath*, the Doctor is shuffling through his wallet, and while he does this you see his library card titled ""Doctor Who."" Would this bother you? Would you count it as wrong, or would this now justify calling him as such out of universe? Why?

___

What I'm gathering as the root of our problem is, perhaps, a difference of what makes such a thing right or wrong in the first place. Perhaps if we get to the bottom of that we can reconcile, or at least come to an understanding, of each other's perspective.

For me, I take a similar approach to this as I do linguistics. There are set rules, yes, but as people speak differently (messing them up), and this becomes the standard, new rules develop. There is a ""correct"" way to speak Spanish, a ""correct"" way to speak italian, and a ""correct"" way to speak portuguese. There was also a ""correct"" way to speak latin. However, due to people speaking latin incorrectly becoming standardized, and this process repeating several times over, new standards and eventually new languages were born.

To take a modern example in English: the subjunctive mood. I won't pretend that it doesn't bother me when people don't use it; as a grammar nazi it makes me want to tear my brain out. Even though it's still technically ""correct"", however, it's becoming the standard. Schools no longer teach grammatical mood. Professors no longer dock points for messing it up. Whether or not it used correctly in a book varies from author to author, editor to editor. As much as I'm loathe to admit it, in 100 years most of the subjunctive will be viewed as archaic. 

In other words, it was wrong, it is wrong depending who you ask, it won't be wrong in the near future.

Now, names.

There is no convention for names in English. Unlike Latin, which had distinct forms depending on the context (there was even a special distinct way to refer *to* someone when speaking to this person directly as opposed to a third party). We do have a list of standard names, and possible abbreviations or nicknames of that name, but the rule is basically as follows: Someone is as they are called. Some senior invents a nickname for a freshman, and the rest of the school starts calling him that. Whether he likes it or not has an impact on moral right or wrong, but has no impact the inherent ""correctness"" or ""incorrectness"" of the name. Because what a name is *for* isn't to sign documents or collect tax returns. What is name is *for* is to express communication regarding the person discussed.

Therefore I define correct (""right"") as such: **Something that fulfills it's function purpose whilst simultaneously following the standard convention). 

The former I have already described, in my mind. The latter ""standard convention"" I have as well, but in passing: simply, there is no English standard for names other than it follows the function. Perhaps you could say the standard is that the name is constant, but I think that could be tied to either requirement.

Let's return to our favorite show.

Does referring to the character as ""Doctor Who"" out-of-universe achieve these requirements? 

Do we know of whom the ""name"" refers? Yes. So is follows function.

Is there an established precedent for this reference? Yes. So it follows standard.

Thus, I argue, in out-of-universe situations calling the character ""Doctor Who.""",0,1407591900,null,0,false,0,cjle8jg,t3_2cywb6,t1_cjle8jg,t1_cjl7pv2,null,1435152296,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

I'm fairly certain signing for a package can't be attached to an agreement you haven't been presented with prior (or at least the opportunity to see), and I don't think import duty is payable on goods supplied in replacement to goods for which you've already paid (and thus paid the appropriate taxes).

This is, however, fairly standard practice.  I bought a t-shirt from America for £20 recently and when it arrived Royal Mail held it at a depot until I paid customs and an £8 handling fee.  The key difference here, I would say, is that FedEx have delivered the package to you and billed you afterwards, without telling you of any of the fees, whereas in my instance Royal Mail held my goods until I paid the fees.

Something similar happened to me, once.  I got a video game from Hong Kong and UPS charged me for customs and 'handling'.  The handling was £8.75.  I never paid it (purely by accident, actually - I just forgot about it - I'm not actually sure how I managed to pay for the customs but not the 'handling') and close to a year later I got a letter from a collections firm asking for the handling fee.  I emailed them asking for the original order number and delivery tracking number so that I could confirm it was legit and they never got back to me, so I presume they dropped it.

If I were you I'd query HTC about it.  Let them know how unhappy you are.  If they don't sort it out for you by telling the courier the package is exempt from import duty due to it being a like-for-like replacement to a defective part already paid and taxed (I'm assuming that such parts are in fact exempt) then you can try talking to, say, Citizens Advice, or HMRC themselves.

true,phishsticker,lfc68,,"Would have been worth it tbh. He's a world class keeper and overall a far better keeper than Mignolet. Keepers earn you many points throughout a season and are often one of the major differences between staying in the top 4. Mignolet is a fantastic shot stopper but his distribution and weakness in the air are pretty massive negatives.

* Belgium and the other low countries are also not very warlike.

Grad scheme applications take a surprisingly long time to fill out, but send as  many as you can. HOWEVER, there is little point in sending out a generic application without tailoring it to the employer/industry. 

Cover letters need careful crafting, CVs you can afford to have just one, but grad schemes use their own online application forms which require several bits of writing to questions like ""name a time you managed a group of people and overcame a problem"". typically 300+ words ish. 

FOR EVERY ONE YOU WRITE, COPY AND PASTE IT IN A WORD DOCUMENT AND SAVE.

Although you shouldn't necessarily send out the same answers, the questions the schemes use are often very similar and you can cut and paste relevant sections to save you time and your sanity. You need to read up online on how to answer these questions and what they're looking for. 

As for experience, an internship with a serious corporate would be fantastic. If not, then don't worry, without outright dishonesty you can make your Saturday job and student society involvement sound like areas where you have developed skills employers value.

Does that sound familiar? The antisemite ranting against the Jew uses the same language as the Occupier whining about the 1% - right down to the colourful metaphors about blood-drinking vermin.

The Jew throughout history has played the role of the arch-capitalist and has often been most successful in this line. That is why the antisemite hates him: that is why Marx despised him and wrote at length about the 'Jewish question': that is why Hitler wrote his manifesto demanding nationalisation, the sharing of profits of industries, the abolition of unearned income, and tough measures against the Jew.

Now let us imagine for the moment that all the stereotypes of the Jew are true: that indeed he is Shylock the great usurer, the monstrous International Banker that the Socialist (be he National or International in preference) so loathes. How will the right winger react? Certainly he will celebrate the Jew! He will welcome the Jew, for that is just the spirit that the right wing wants to encourage in society.

No, no: if the stereotype the antisemites circulate and complain about is of the Jew as moneylender, as capitalist and exploiter, then that antisemite can only be left wing.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"&gt; Whats quite ironic because that is exactly what you're doing, we could both make these kind of statements

It's not so much ironic, as a hard truth. Scotland is small and it's going to get bullied in any negotiated settlement. the rUK is 10 times larger... You can talk about laws and conventions all you like. But you seem to be making the classic error of assuming international law works like domestic law. If you break the law you can expect the police to turn up on your doorstep and arrest you. The law is black and white and actively enforced. ""International law"" is very different, and infact isn't so much a ""law"" as a nebulus set of treaties and agreements. Clearly there is going to be a maritime dispute over whom the oil belongs to and it is up to **both** parties to settle the dispute. One way would be for the Scots to press ahead via the International Court of Justice... but that could take 20-30 years of hard fighting in international courts. The better option is both parties agree a settlement. Now, the SNP tend to assume the basis for this would be the median line used to calculate fisheries. But there is no real legal basis for this, other than that's how it worked for a different maritime industry. Infact, the rUK and iScotland would be entirely free to negotiate between them any sort of settlement provided both parties agree. Most analysts agree the likely outcome would be that much of the profits would be negotiated away to the rUK in exchange for other concessions. 

&gt; England are not going to break international law by claiming it for themselves.

Who said England is going to claim anything for themselves? The **rUK** isn't going to claim anything unilaterally either. The point is, the Scots will have to negotiate over important issues like currency, and it strikes me as being quite likely they will negotiate oil profits in exchange for currency sharing or even union, and possibly an easy ride into the EU.

&gt; Borders

Think you misunderstand. Do you know where 75% of all goods entering the UK (including to Scotland) come through?... the docks at Southampton. Most of the remainder comes through the Channel Tunnel, Gatwick/Heathrow or other English ports. It's a similar picture for exports. There are 3 gas pipeline interconnectors and 2 major electricity interconnectors. All bar 1 travel via England. The tough reality for the Scots is that if they want to access international markets, they're going to have to do so **via** the rUK. Now, if Scotland doesn't automatically get EU membership that means import duties and it also means the border will become actively enforced. Nobody is talking about some pathetic 4th century land grab. This isn't Game of Thrones.

The bottom line is the **rUK** does have a lot more leverage than Scotland. I honestly think Scots might be suprised in the event of a yes vote at how cuntish a disgruntled British public can be, and at just how little international and domestic leverage they actually have available to them. They might also be shocked at just what a choke-hold the rUK can put on Scotland economically if the Scots want to play hardball.",0,1407595537,null,0,1407595988,0,cjlfcc8,t3_2cz4eo,t1_cjlfcc8,t1_cjlec2a,null,1435152893,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

We haven't basically seen our two big money attacking signings kick a football yet. Also we will not see Origi in an LFC shirt for a year.

This and the fact that we haven't still brought in the striker everyone are waiting for is making this summer a bit disappointing. 

I know we Sturridge and he should be fit to start tomorrow, but our attackers haven't scored a single goal during pre-season (excluding Peterson) which is a bit worrying.

true,Emunim,cnty-scotland,North Britain,"&gt;As I said to you, several times now, you are basing everything on a large assumption that the majority of the oil revenue will belong to the new Scottish nation.

No, wrong. Wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong. Your reading comprehension is fucking shocking. **THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT AN INDEPENDENT SCOTLAND WOULD HAVE.** How can you not understand that? This is about what makes up Scottish GDP now, **AS PART OF THE UNION**, which includes (as assumed by ONS, by GERS, by the Scottish Government, by anybody who tries to calculate it who actually matters) a geographical share of oil &amp; gas.

&gt;Now, whilst Alex Salmond has said it will (lets face it, he says a lot of things) you'll notice that nobody in the UK government has actually backed that up in any meaningful way.

The UK government has said it will negotiate the share, for obvious reasons it is not pre-negotiating before the votes are cast, but for it's assumptions on Scotland going independent it uses geographical split, make of that what you will. But to emphasize this again, **COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT.**

&gt;In reality, most sources (like the FT) now seem to agree the likely outcome would be that the Scots would negotiate most oil profits away in exchange for concessions from the rUK

This is your trouble; reading comprehension. The FT article you've linked to doesn't even mention Scotland negotiating away oil profits to the UK for concession. It doesn't even touch on post-indepedence negoatiations at all.

&gt;Scotland isn't Norway. They don't have anywhere near the oil reserves, and they have to contest the oil with another nation that is 10 times their size. Now, I know your little tartan fingers are just itching to tell me about the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and all that tosh - but the bottom line is, if the Scots want to take that approach they'll need to go through the International Court of Justice which could take decades. This view has been supported by academics.

Totally agree, though your link suggests 3 to 10-ish years is the more likely time frame. Again, though, this paragraph is totally irrelevant since I've never made any claims about a post-independence Scotland.

&gt;In reality, if by some surprise Scots do vote yes, then instead of proclaiming to the rUK what is and isn't their, they'll actually have to start doing this thing called negotiating - and their position is deceptively weak. Scots can only really ply pressure on the rUK with the pleasures of oil profits or the pains of HMNB Clyde. On the latter, they are actually between a rock and a hard place since the US/NATO will likely ply just about as much pressure as they can (financial, political etc.) on the new Scottish state as possible to ensure the British strategic nuclear deterrent remains, and will also probably push for a strong Royal Navy presence operating out of ""Scottish waters"" for the strategic GIUK gap... My guess is the Scots would have to accept some kind of UK Sovereign Overseas Territory - probably with a commitment to making it nominally ""shared"" (though effectively Royal Navy run) within a period of say 10-20 years. There may then be some further vague commitment to diminishing the nuclear storage and maintenance facility over a much longer timescale.

Another paragraph irrelevant to whether Scotlands GDP pc is higher than England. You're good at those, I'll give you that.

&gt;Scottish GDP per capita is not higher than the rUK contrary to what several sources suggest including the ONS and Gers. It isn't that the statistics are wrong, it's just they are not accurate in this situation since they were not collected in such a way as to accurately guage Scottish GDP.

Fantastic. The organisations full of qualified people that work this sort of stuff out for a living are wrong because you think they are. You've yet to actually cite anything that says it isn't higher, btw. I mean, normally I would just take your word for it and assume you know better than everyone else, but that 'little tartan fingers' jab really got to me, so I'm going to have to insist on evidence. I have fingers like fucking tree trunks mate.

&gt;I will leave you with this article which summaries nicely many of the arguments as to why.

I can think of a dozen in the past couple years that I remember vividly at wanting to write to the board to sign them! 

Players I remember ''scouting'' were Courtois (when he was at Genk), Angel Correa (just gone to Atletico, sadly has had some heart surgery first, but will be insanely talented), Witsel at Standard (esp after the whole leg breaking challenge - still kinda sickening) Mitrovic gone to Anderlecht for pennies, will be incredible IMO, Jeremy Mathieu at Sochaux, now 20m Euro at Barca, Hazard very early on at Lille, Kompany at Anderlecht - now City, Digne when he was 16 at Lille, now at PSG and one of the best young LB's in the world (imo), Iturbe at Quilmes, El Shawaary at Genoa, Boateng at HSV - now Munich, Jordi Alba early on at Valencia, James Rodriguez (before the Porto move) at Banfield when he won the Argentine Championship with them and looked great in the Libertadores in 2010 (5m euros was just under the asking price)..

I'm sure (hope) that we are looking at these types of players though. But for a club like Spurs, getting these guys in young is our best chances at securing future world class players or just flipping a profit on them. I wish they either had a) scouting courses for real b) some form of ITK than can actually drop a list of these on the relevant dudes desk. I would watch each of those I listed even more and do reports on them if I was being paid for it. Freelance scouting...problem is, everyone says *yeah, you must play FM ;)* and ignores it because obviously nobody watches real football and obviously all of these players are usually on FM at some team if you load the max database. Hindsight is great and many could be hit &amp; total misses and you can't necessarily predict it - but the ones I listed were very obviously gonna be special.

But as you've been told, that is based on the fisheries median line and there is no reason to suggest that will necessarily be the case. There is no legal precedent for it, it was simply the way the fisheries were divided that has been applied to oil for the purposes of estimating (by the SNP) what they might expect in oil revenue. It doesn't take any consideration of the fact the exact delimitation could be drawn anywhere during negotiations.

**Scottish GDP per capita is not higher than the rUK.** Those sources claiming otherwise are either inappropriately cited (ONS/GERS) composite GDPs reverse engineered from UK GDP and are of little meaning since they are subject to so much interpretation, factually incorrect (e.g. the SNP material on the matter with its fantastical claims) or actively deceptive (such as most of what spews forth from Salmonds mouth).

true,RifleEyez,null,null,"&gt;problem is, everyone says yeah, you must play FM ;) and ignores it because obviously nobody watches real football and obviously all of these players are usually on FM at some team if you load the max database.

Yup. I edited my post a bit so I dunno if you caught that. It's the same people who don't actually watch football beyond their league. I remember Vividly watching Ribery when he played in Turkey in about 10 full games (I dunno why, but some late night channel had a lot of these games on, like TransWorld sport or something) and I remember thinking ''man, someone should sign him!''. I always thought it was odd cuz he was French in Turkey and had his scars so stood out. 5m move to France from there and now look..

Ironically, I remember Everton got access to the FM database early for that reason. FM is NOT a scouting tool and they get it wrong as much as they get it right - but for finding the players clubs, ages and eligibility (like nationalities) and such, it's actually not *that* bad. Just if you ignore the PA ratings and actually watch them yourself. Same as WhoScored - WyScout is a bit more in depth though and you can actually get automatic video clips of them and such - proper clubs use it. It's all done like that now but nothing beats going to watch them.

Obviously even then it's difficult to judge - but I dunno, usually you can see that spark in a player that makes them different and if we're talking small compensation fees or sub 5m transfers it's not such a massive gamble. Sometimes players who looked decent at 18 go on to become stars, some of them are already coveted worldwide at 18 and it's a bit different. Somtimes those hyped players never make it (Bojan) and it's players that come out the woodwork that make it. Just a gamble, really and depends on the career moves they make and how much they WANT it. 

...but it always sucks a player you saw who could have gone for like sub 5m euros goes on for fees like 40-80m 5 years later.  ",0,1407598757,null,0,1407599480,0,cjlggxb,t3_2d2dtb,t1_cjlggxb,t1_cjlg67r,null,1435153424,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

true,theanonymousthing,null,null,"Ok good question. 

Ultimately i am of the opinion that Negredo and Aguero are the best partnership, they both offer something different; Negredo is the big target man with his back to the goal that can muscle his way in, control a high ball and distribute it to Aguero, it also helps that Negredo has fantastic technical ability and is impressively creative for a big forward and (before his shoulder injury) was a great finisher. Aguero is the nimble, speedy and very technical player that feeds off the balls Negredo collects and distributes, it's also a plus that Aguero feeds off Negredo's creativity. In addition to that the pair have amazing chemistry for a relatively new partnership, they both seem to inherently know where each other are on the field and what runs and plays they have in mind. If Negredo and Aguero remain fit, they would be my ideal striker partnership.

Dzeko is an interesting one. It's really hard to describe Dzeko to someone who doesn't watch him week in-week out but i'll try. He is the most frustrating player you will ever watch. He will miss 5 sitters before he puts away a match winning goal. One minute your cursing his name and calling him rubbish and the next minute hes a hero and a legend. despite his erraticnness and the fact it takes him 5 sitters to score, im going to contradict myself and say strangely enough you can rely on him for goals in the tough matches. He's a goal scorer, no doubt just a very frustrating one. The thing that seperates Negredo from Dzeko are: 

(a) First Touch: Negredo has an amazing first touch for a striker and this often creates chances. Dzeko has a relatively poor first touch and can be a bit clumsy on the ball ruining chances (however this has improved a lot over the last season)

(b) Creativity: Negredo again has great vision and the technical ability to pull of what he envisages, it means that instead of taking the wrong choice and snatching at a half opportunity he will lay the ball off to a player in a better position. Dzeko is a traditional striker this is a good and bad thing because though it means he's a great poacher and is always looking to shoot, it leaves his game somewhat narrow minded and one dimensional; he'll snatch at opportunities that don't really exist or try to blast the ball from outside of the box despite someone in obviously in a better position right in front of him, he just doesn't have the creativity and vision.

(c) Overall contribution: There is something Mourinho-esque about how Negredo plays as a striker,when he's not on the ball he's everywhere; tracking back and defending, pressing the ball, making runs and drawing defenders out of position, generally giving the defenders a hard time which creates space for others. When Dzeko doesn't have the ball at his feet he often disappears, again his game in the respect under Pellegrini has improved drastically, but often you will see him do his locally famous impression of a lamp-post. He just sort of stands around expecting the perfect ball to arrive at his feet. He doesn't track back as much (this has improved a lot) but more importantly he doesn't hassle the defenders with runs and movement which means our attack can stagnate a little because there's no movement which creates space for others.

This looks like i've characterised Dzeko as a bad player but he's deffinitley not, he's a great player and he wouldn't be where he is now if he wasn't a top player, however he just doesn't appear as complete and rounded a player as Negredo when he was at full fitness.

Onto Jovetic. Jovetic is really just the Montenegrin Aguero; he's nimble, creative a great finisher (though this is one area of the game he could possibly get even better at) and is very technical and comfortable dribbling past players and has a lot of confidence in himself and remains very composed under pressure. He's a great outlet and is always looking do something with the ball to bring it forward into a good attacking position. He's had an absolutely fantastic pre-season so far netting plenty of goals and showing his fantastic form. People say ""oh city benched him, oh city are ruining him they dont want to give him playing time."" This is not the case at all. Much like rodwell, Jovetic last season had legs made of confetti and was out injured for a majority of the season, but when he was fit he was played as much as he can scoring 6 times despite being wracked with injury. Pellegrini really believes in him and its obvious why, the guy has got bundles of talent.

If i had my way Aguero and Negredo would be our main striker partnership (provided both where healthy) and Jovetic and Dzeko would be the secondary Strike Partnership who i hope would replicate the chemistry and effectiveness 'Negeuro' have.

So first choice ST: Aguero

Second Choice ST: Negredo

If Aguero got injured Jovetic would replace him

If Negredo got injured Dzeko would replace him

I hoped that these would be first ones to be addressed and it is starting to seem that the Moreno deal will drag on a bit (hopefully will be completed before the start of the season but who knows really what Sevilla decide?) and the striker links have been quiet - most big name rumours are squashed by Bad News Barrett or don't pick up speed at all.

true,Emunim,cnty-scotland,North Britain,"&gt;You are wrong about Scottish GDP and you'll find sources like ONS don't include it in current Scottish GDP calculations. That is because under the current tax arrangement revenues from oil are assigned to a seperate economic region called the ""UK Continental Shelf"" or UKCS.

Yes, but that's just splitting hairs. If the government changed it so all finance revenue went through it's own economic region, it wouldn't change the fact that the majority of it was generated in the South East. Similarly, most oil is in Scottish waters. Just because it is called something else doesn't change that.

&gt;You keep banging the drum about this ""Geograhical Share"" of oil. But as you've been told, that is based on the fisheries median line and there is no reason to suggest that will necessarily be the case. There is no legal precedent for it, it was simply the way the fisheries were divided that has been applied to oil for the purposes of estimating (by the SNP) what they might expect in oil revenue. It doesn't take any consideration of the fact the exact delimitation could be drawn anywhere during negotiations.

Again, I am making no claim about how much oil would be Scottish post independence. Give it a rest.

You are under the wrong impression if you think the geographic split thing comes from the SNP. GERS have done a report on this every year since the 90s. I am using the figures from the GERS report using a geographical split. The only other way they look at it is by population split, which you could make an argument for using, but nobody ever does because of the obvious.

If you have figures for oil revenue if the waters were split like those two academics think it would be, then I'd be interested to here them. But as most oil fields are North of Aberdeen I don't think it will make a huge difference.

&gt;Scottish GDP per capita is not higher than the rUK. Those sources claiming otherwise are either inappropriately cited (ONS/GERS) composite GDPs reverse engineered from UK GDP and are of little meaning since they are subject to so much interpretation, factually incorrect (e.g. the SNP material on the matter with its fantastical claims) or actively deceptive (such as most of what spews forth from Salmonds mouth).

So far you have provided two sources saying it is higher and zero saying it isn't. I remain unconvinced.",0,1407601212,null,0,false,0,cjlhf12,t3_2cz4eo,t1_cjlhf12,t1_cjlgf36,null,1435153861,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Of course, his end product is not the best, but his mere presence on the pitch can be effective in breaking up defenses. 

EDIT: Also. His pressing is some of the best in the squad and will earn him more points with the manager than much anything else he does.

The Taliban still exist, despite our best efforts to do it to them, Al Qaeda still exist, and now IS(IS) have appeared, and are using US equipment they stole from Iraqi bases, and equipment given to the 'rebels' in Syria.

No matter how well intentioned we are every time 'The West' (aka Kafir, infidels etc etc) kills innocent people (see collateral murder, drone bombing of wedding parties, drone bombing based on mobile phone meta data) we make an easier job for the jihadist propagandists.

If there is humanitarian need then we should help by providing medical and emergency supplies, even help people defend themselves by providing intelligence, armaments and training. There are more options than either kill people or do nothing.

Also, before anyone tries to convince me that 'they are not people' uneducated young men have always been easy to recruit with speeches, songs, and a bit of flag waving, and after knowing little else but war for their entire lives it is not surprising that so many are willing to fight.

The game ended in a stalemate at 0-0. Both sides looked good, I personally thought we edged them slightly but not by much. 

A lot of positives from the performance. The players left over from last seasons dismal season looked fresher and ready to go and the new lads seemed right up for it. 

We started the game playing 532, which gave us a solid defence - we had a solid defence last season, 10th best in League 2 - which I wasn't surprised at. Midfield had veterans Mansell and Monkhouse in it along side workhorse Sinclair. Up front we went for the traditional 'big and little' combo.

Creativity seems to be a big issue for us right now. Taylor is a fantastic finisher but got next to no chances to score. When Gosling came on he gave us a new lease of life and was unlucky right at the end to have his effort saved by McKeown. 

0-0 was the fair result. Thought we could have nicked it right at the end but came up short.

2 more signings still being waited on finalisation, Clarke wants them in for Barnet. Hopefully one of them is a creative player.

**First half**

[ ] Gylfi looked to be in free role with nowhere to go because Bony is playing cf, why are we playing Gyfli out of position.

[ ] It looked like we were playing an asymmetric formation which meant Rangel had no support in front and has to go there himself, but then we are extremely vulnerable behind him. I think we are trying to play Siggy at right mid ahead of Rangel but he keeps drifting away.

[ ] Why play 2 strikers and one winger?

[ ] Gomis has great hold up - needs the extra winger to give the ball to on overlap.

[ ] Asymmetric is a stupid idea.

[ ] Gyfli tries to come across to support Rangel but never gets there in time because he's too busy sharing a position with Bony.

[ ] Bony has a big ass.

[ ] Fabianski scares me a little.

[ ] Ki and Shelvey both fantastic on the ball, I'm feeling positive about that partnership.

[ ] Williams is basically a liability.

[ ] Montero was a great at beating his man but needed to improve his decision making.

[ ] Swap Bony for Dyer at half time then put Siggy just behind Bony

[ ] Amat for Bartley because fuck why not?

**Second half**

[ ] Bartley sub is 10 minutes and two goals too late

[ ] Need more pace, or to atleast make a run. Our counterattack in non existent.

[ ] Why are we playing Gyfli out of position? This is stupid. It's like we learned nothing.

[ ] I wouldn't be surprised if we have made less than 10 passes in the final third this game.

[ ] Us on the other hand? We could be 5-0 down just from getting counterattacked. The worst part is that we aren't even throwing men forward.

[ ] Bony and Gomis have had their best opportunities from headers. Unfortunately, they have all been tame and easy for the keeper, or just wide. Chances we should have buried.

[ ] Bony having to drop too deep to pick up the ball. That should be Sigurdson's job.

[ ] Siggy moved to behind Gomis, like I suggested at half time, and suddenly we are getting him into dangerous areas...... Offside every time...... But there is still potential.....

true,UK-Redditor,cnty-uk,God Save The Queen,"All we achieve by further intervention is to fuel the spread of extremism; putting boots on the ground in the Middle East does nothing for the long-term stability of the region and turns the more and more of the populace against us, not just from incidents of collateral damage but through the resurgence of extremist groups once we've left. The period of British imperialism is long-gone, short of a collaborative UN initiative – which won't happen, for several reasons – we cannot afford to make the necessary commitments to policing/'nurturing' long-term stability (which is ethically questionable, to begin with) to justify further involvement. Any help we can offer, in response to the crisis which we unquestionably helped to bring about, should be in the form of appropriate aid – possibly including military hardware to aid the government, if it's deemed tenable. Other than that, we should look to do whatever possible to cease our direct involvement in the Middle East.

Sorry to post the Daily Mail, but Gen. Sir Mike Rose wrote a great piece recently in response to Blair's latest essay and I think he summarised the situation extremely well:

&gt;*CLAIM: We need a decisive military response, says Blair, 'including military strikes against extremists in Iraq and Syria'.*

&gt;*TRUTH: As we have seen, military intervention invariably makes things worse. So far, our adventures in the Middle East have served only to increase hatred of the West and recruit still more insurgents to fight alongside  our enemy.*

&gt;*But Blair, all too clearly, cannot face this brutal truth. He once said that war is an imperfect instrument for righting human distress. He should pay more heed to his own words.*

He also goes further to discuss the the circumstances which brought about our initial involvement in Iraq, if you'd care to read the rest of the article ([source](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2658644/Blairs-bizarre-claims-reality-One-Britains-distinguished-generals-says-former-PM-complete-denial.html)).",0,1407605859,null,0,1407606087,0,cjljae4,t3_2d2g13,t1_cjljae4,t1_cjlh8yd,null,1435154743,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

A firsthand witness piece can be quite persuasive, but, yeah, you're right, not convincing in this case. Ian Bone has this to say as he first starts writing:

&gt; There’s a lot to report but most urgently the toffs threw down water and piss bombs from the 5th floor narrowly missing passers by with kids and us and the Focus mums with kids. I don’t know how much damage a water bombs thrown from so high could do to a baby or child but imagine it could be serious.

Now, I think if you were genuinely getting piss thrown at you,  you wouldn't complain about the possibility of water bombs hurting kids. He seems to drop the word 'water' pretty quick,  and then starts just calling them 'piss bombs'. For seconds, I don't think you can get urine into water balloons on the fly, I think it would require some serious planning and I doubt this protest was big enough to have people staying home planning for it.
 
More likely they were just water bombs, and some kids or immature adults (literally no evidence it was rich or posh people) found a big group of clumped-together people too tempting to ignore.  As for whether Ian Bone is a class warrior with an exaggerated story, here's his concluding paragraph:

&gt; In the middle of London at early evening rush hour the arrogant toffs can hurl piss bombs with impunity at the lower orders scurrying beneath their segregated £4.5 million apartments. This is naked class war………THEY STARTED IT….WE’LL FINISH IT…………NEXT WEDNESDAY 5.30pm…………….THE BATTLE OF COMMERCISAL STREET IS A BATTLE FOR ALL WORKING CLASS PEOPLE IN LONDON……………..BE THERE!

**Kolarov:**  As far as my thoughts go on your fantasy players, Kolarov seems to have the LB position nailed down except for cup games and when he might need a rest, although he does score the occasional goal he is probably going to get most of your points by assists since he supports the attack as much as he defends.  

**Dzeko:**  The situation is strange for Dzeko because he came off such an important year helping secure the title for us but he's not our #1 choice in any world.  However since Negredo is out for 3 months with a broken foot, Dzeko will once again have the ability to prove his worth since we might play a system with him and either jovetic or aguero paired up in attack (I don't think we'll play in a system with both aguero and jovetic up top).  To address your worry about his likeliness to be subbed off regularly, from what I can recall he doesn't get subbed off often enough for it to be a worry for you!

* Montero is a bugger for crossing at the byline instead of either taking the cross earlier on his left or cutting back and using his right.

* Gylfi looks like he was drifting in naturally, after half time he was a bit more disciplined, he was out on the right when we were out of possession but with the ball it was just Ragel.

* Playing a 4-2(CMs)-2(wide men)-2 in possession, 4-4-2 defensively.

* Offensively that formation works if you have a player like Dyer on the right. It'd be great for when we are struggling for healthy CAMs. However, I think we'd be better suited to a 4-4-2 wide diamond, or a 4-1-2(wide midfielders)-1-2 if we are going to play with two strikers, that way we utilise our assets (big strong forwards, brilliant CAMs, pacey wingers) without sacrificing too much space in the centre of the field. (I though shelvey and ki were playing more DM roles at times with how far from the strikers they were.

* Defensively we lacked one thing and one thing only - pressure. With a bit of pressure we could have forced mistakes and been quick to counter, however the issue of there being no out and out RW was evident today until Bray came on and the play was faster, and more spread. I find we also clumped a lot, luckily Villareal didn't capitalise but more than a few times if they had switched flank the lack of pace on Rangel's side and him not tracking meant that they'd have had an easy cross.

* I also saw Taylor getting drawn out of position while defending and the ball played over him into the space behind, he needs to watch that.

So off I go into Spain.. and WUT? The phone didn't take a fucking Spanish sim. After some reading about this while abroad, iPhones are LOCKED TO THE SIM CARD YOU PUT IN THEM. So, I was mis sold because he said I could it abroad. 

Thought 'lolz on you EE', and just used my phone like I would at home, generating stupid bills. So when I got back I told the guy all this, he looked into the call and then called me saying he'll cover those bills, and it's like 25quid or something to get it unlocked which he said they'd cover.

It is a jam-packed ""episode"" with everything that makes Doctor Who great. It has 10 and 11 with their companions without giving up any huge spoilers. 

While the plot of the episode has major implications on the Doctor Who universe in general, it doesn't spoil anything to occur in the series leading up to it. Frankly, I'd like to know what it's like to watch the ""new"" series with Day of the Doctor as my intro... it sheds a brand new light on the Doctor; especially 9's ""Dalek"" episode. 

What's even better is that, if you've hooked the people you introduce the show to, they'll be able to watch it again when they've made it through all 7 series and get a fresh look at it all thanks to all of the Doctor Who inside jokes planted throughout the episode.

2. For regulatory compliance reasons you'll need an address to open a bank account. You'll need to fill out FATCA forms too. Your new bank is obliged to report you to the US for opening an account outside of the US so that they can chase you for tax returns.

3. If you have a job that helps a great deal. An introductory letter from your employer might help. Just saying you're trustworthy and employed and moving to the UK etc.

4. Good luck :)

Edit : Just to be clear... living abroad as a US citizen isn't ideal, your country has some heavy handed laws to try to combat financial crime, international terrorism and tax avoidance. You do need to become fluent very quickly on your tax obligations.

It just seems like it would make it harder to create much movement up front. 

Today's system but with Dyer on instead of either one of them seems like a better, more balanced set-up that suits the style of play better than a set-up that shoehorns 2 CFs into a team that should probably only have 1. Should be more movement and possession in the final 3rd, theoretically, as well as more opportunities to penetrate and create. This system feels like it would favour crosses too heavily, without creating the space for Gylfi and Ki to link up with whichever striker we use.

I was really impressed with our pressing v Celtic (you can only play what is in front of you, and the hunger was still there) and today we looked dominant first half. Obviously we look a lot stronger now all over the pitch, and with Lamela/Eriksen firing on all cylinders, Bentaleb always improving, Ade turning up under Poch, Soldado getting over his traumas, Jan having another great season and finally Davies/Rose cover at LB we should be good. Also our new signings will be settled, so Capoue is looking great and Vlad I have faith in.

However...changes - it's difficult because we made so many last year, and it doesn't need to be a even bigger season of transition. But I can see a few weak links/players that don't fit I think we could raise some money out of, and I can think of a good handful of young, attainable players I would love to see coming in - from our Academy too. 

Also, because of the system we're playing I'm skeptical on Chadli, Lennon, Townsend, Paulinho, Dembele &amp; possibly Sandro. Especially the last 3 if we do bring Schneiderlin in and also if Musacchio comes in, I feel Kaboul or Dawson can go which is another good 5m say? If Depay or a real AML comes in, then I'm thinking Lennon/Chadli are gone. Do we keep Carroll, Cebellos, Pritchard, Mason despite their potentials - they're also pretty old to just be ''potentially good'', so do we sell for a mil, couple mil each? So as you can see, I could be here all day debating changes :) Also, do we play with Eriksen/Holtby/Lamela or look for a real Left Winger, cuz Townsend/Chadli/Lennon aren't good enough there. So it's just...transition, again.

We know if Israel stop then Hamas would attack. In fact we know that there's literally nothing that would stop Hamas short of the end of Israel.

We know that Palestine as a whole chooses Hamas as their government. So on the surface it's their making.

Of course we all know that it's not as simple as that. Israel have demonised, mistreated and dehumanised the Palestinian people.

Although that may be a bit of a hyperbole, Southampton have recently shown no small club can get into the top 6 relying on their academy. Chelsea and Man City have shown you can win the league with money.

Perhaps I don't want a Man City situation, I think Everton are my second favourite club in the PL. Not overspending, but recruiting young and using their academy. 

With a stable financial situation, we can pump money into the academy and hopefully return to the beautiful-footballing side we were in the '80s - bringing in youth and competing for top 5.

Let me address the most alarming thing first: If you are finding yourself being fisted while someone is screaming ""BUH! BUH! BUH! BOWTIES ARE KOOL"", and it is not a consensual scenario, you really need to pay closer attention to where you are leaving your drinks unattended.  

As far as fandoms are concerned, the Whovians are a rabid lot.  We are spread out over a half a century span, ranging from a 50 year old in a scarf to a 8 year old in a fez (inserts fist FUH! FUH! FUH! FEZZES ARE KOOL).  It has become an international phenomenon that has broken gender, language and age barriers to encompass all sorts, yeah people are going to be getting a bit cray over it.

&gt;but I just can't stand the people who make references every chance they get. 

Have you met a Family Guy fan?  A Simpsons fan?  A *insert something to be a fan of here* fan?  Yeah they are going to reference the bejeesus out of that show, because to them, it is their favorite thing right now.  I personally cannot stand any conversation that starts, ""Do you remember that time on South Park?""  But I do not look down on that person, just accept that they enjoy this show in an entirely different fashion.  

I am a 25 year old male, I have a homemade 4th Doctor scarf, several screwdrivers, 2 TARDIS mugs, a TARDIS keychain, Dalek Poster, a very cool fez, and a full 11th Doctor cosplay outfit (including an obviously very cool Buh Buh Buh Bowtie).  I've devoured all of New Who and I'm up to the 6th Doctor, and cannot get enough of this program.  I am a well adjusted, educated, and relaxed individual.  But if you get the ball rolling on The Doctor, I get very excited, ""Yes!  Lets talk about this thing that I love and relate to.""

You need to check yourself, judging other people for liking the same thing you like, but differently.  As another post states, its probably your age.  I'll end this rant against you with some wonderful words from Mr. Simon Pegg (who was also on Doctor Who as The Editor on Satellite 5), I think you should ruminate on what he is saying:

""Being a geek is all about being honest about what you enjoy and not being afraid to demonstrate that affection.  It means never having to play it cool about how much you like something.  It's basically a license to proudly emote on a somewhat childish level rather than behave like a supposed adult.  Being a geek is extremely liberating.""

What people don't seem to realize is that the entire world has been flooded with liquidity (AKA freshly printed money) - insolvent governments and banks worldwide are being kept afloat by zero percent interest rates.

There's nothing normal or sustainable about this 'recovery' and it ends in one of two ways - either things normalize and interest rates rise, or a full on currency crisis. 

It's a madhouse. And the biggest betrayal is that you are forced into trying to second guess this insanity just to put a fucking roof over your head.

Where you believe that as long as it follows function, it is correct. Where I believe that calling someone by something other than their actual or given name, in a serious manner, is wrong.

The answer to the library card question can be a little fuzzy. It would definitely depend on the context. Did he put his name down as ""Doctor Who"" when getting the card? Or did the librarian, thinking there was something following Doctor, just write it on the card. If it was the former I would accept Doctor Who as one of his names. The reason for this would be the same as the Clara, 11th doctor name example. The Doctor accepts her calling him by that name. So even if someone in the show called him ""Doctor Who"", I believe he would have to accept that name for it to be the right thing to do. Another example being that he has accepted one of his names as ""The Oncoming Storm"". Just like if someone calls me Jim, my name does not become Jim unless I accept it as a name for myself.

To me this was just a complaint of mine that turned into a good discussion. I have no ill thoughts of you trying to argue for the name ""Doctor Who"". I fully understand why you believe the name is a legitimate name for the character.

As for the match, I'm heavily disappointed in Leverkusen, apart from not looking hungry, and aside from Wanyama tackles, they went to ground way too often for my liking, anytime we went forward with a bit of force, they went to ground and played out the medical staff.

The OG was interesting, looked as though Pelle was shooting, but it was so light I'd imagine it was meant as a pass back to Boruc, but I'm not gonna fault him for it, only a friendly, and he has much more to offer.

Tadic was a bit quiet, but I didn't expect much because of everytime we went forward, play was broken up by a whistle from a ref who didn't seem to have much control of the game.

Ramirez was bright when he came on, linking up nicely with Fonte in particular as one point. Isgrove also looked very hungry, never giving up on a ball.

Fonte I think proved to fans that Lovren wasn't making him look better last season, he may have made him better, but I think Fonte was great today, same as last season. however Yoshida was terrible,, out of position, slow and made too many mistakes for my liking, hopefully we get some of the CB's we're looking at.

Not a terrible result, we played as though it were a friendly, a lot of people not committing to tackles or stretching for balls, it was fairly obvious, hopefully we can take our A-game to Liverpool next Sunday.

We tried to play Sahin as one of the two forward midfielders and he doesn't press as well as anyone else we've had at that spot since. Sahin also doesn't have the lateral quickness that Lucas and Gerrard have. A guy like Can fits the DM mould much better because of his athleticism, even if he isn't as technically gifted as Sahin.

At Dortmund they usually play him as part of a double pivot with a more defensive player like Bender next to him. Seems like he might be a Scholes type player who needs a destroyer next to him to get possession and give him the ball (which might also help explain why he didn't get much of a chance at defensive mid).

It really was IMO a case of right place wrong time otherwise I thought Sahin was going to be a legend. Has such a similar skill set to Xabi Alonso and we could've had him for cheap.

true,taxi7,null,null,"Such an episode needs to stand on its own and not be part of an arc. And there should be *three* such episodes, working under the logic that you need to realize the Doctor is an alien who regularly changes his appearance and personality. Doctor Who can be intimidating to a newcomer, so I do believe limiting this to three episodes instead of eleven is necessary. Let them seek out the classic Doctors on their own time. 

Given those standards, here's my list.

Eccleston: his series is tragically short, so the choice is made easy through slim pickings. However, I feel even if he did have additional seasons, **Dalek** would have always been the clear cut winner. For a newcomer who has no idea what a Dalek is or what one even looks like, this is a suspenseful and terrifying look at Doctor Who's most iconic monster.

Tennant: We like to recommend Blink for some reason, but as has been mentioned many times over the years, this is an awkward recommendation. It's a great story, but one that fails to showcase the Doctor's personality because he's not often on-screen. Human Nature/Family of Blood is also a contender for best Tennant story, but one that I hesitate to recommend because, for much of it, we don't get to see the Doctor *as the Doctor*. We see some great acting from Tennant, true, but it's a human portrayal instead of the clever Time Lord mumbo jumbo that makes us love him.

With that small preface out of the way, I'm going to recommend **Midnight**. This may seem like an odd choice for a few reasons, one of them being the lack of a companion. I feel like this is a nice choice, though, because this Doctor has so many more companions than the other modern Doctors that it's hard to choose which companion to pair him against. This story, where he's alone, happens to showcase his love for humanity (the scene where he jams the movie playback so he can chat with those aboard the airplane strikes me as a very Tenth Doctor thing to do), and overall the story is equal measures funny and serious. 

Smith: I don't like this Doctor much, but even if I did, I think I would still immediately choose **A Christmas Carol**.  This era focused a lot on the writers fooling around with time travel in clever and sometimes convoluted ways, and nowhere is this more interesting than this episode. Similar to my choice for Tennant, this story is a great showcase for Smith's dramatic and comedic facades. 

These may have been poorly written summaries, but I think these are three episodes that should certainly be considered for newbies.",0,1407614930,null,0,1407615325,0,cjlmy32,t3_2d2kxb,t1_cjlmy32,t3_2d2kxb,null,1435156536,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

I have worked as a lifeguard at two pools in Bournville and Selly Oak, Tiverton Road and Linden Road.

Tiverton Road is probably your best bet for lane swimming. The customers and (most of) the staff are very friendly, as most have been going there a long time. Lane swimming is very good, everyone is there just to swim, you won't get anyone messing around. Only downside is that the pool is quite small.

Linden Road is swimming lessons/parties/staff only.

Never been to Northfield pool, but it has been renovated more recently than Tiverton, so is probably in a better state. But it's in Northfield...",0,1407615717,null,0,false,0,cjln93y,t3_2cj989,t1_cjln93y,t3_2cj989,null,1435156681,3,false,brum,t5_2rdjk,3
