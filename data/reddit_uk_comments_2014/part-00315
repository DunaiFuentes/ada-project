Rodgers should honestly have a look in the mirror; Sakho, Skrtel, Agger, Lovren, Coates and all were all proven buys till they got here.

On that scale defensively, I'd say we didn't do too bad. What we are really missing are the goals from last season. We need a new formula ASAP, I don't see that being in Balotelli as a lone striker.

On the Adoption and Children Bill:

&gt;A recent opinion poll carried out in a very safe, strong Labour-held constituency was taken over a sample of 500 people. Most national opinion polls are taken over a sample of 1,000, so 500 is quite a respectable figure over a small area. The question asked was:

&gt;""If you died would you like your children to be adopted by two homosexual men?"".

&gt;The answers were quite revealing: 71 per cent of the Labour voters said ""No""; as did 81 per cent of the Conservative voters; and 65 per cent of the Liberal Democrat voters said ""No"".

Is it bigoted of her to point out public opinion?

On the Equality Bill:

&gt;My amendment would prevent them being forced to take part in homosexual civil partnership ceremonies, in weddings involving transsexual people, and in adoptions involving unmarried or homosexual couples.

Is it bigoted to want people to have the right to opt out of something they disagree with? She's hardly trying to force her own personal view into law. That becomes quite clear if you look at her other contributions.

It's quite possible to be against gay marriage and similar without being bigoted. (Just to be clear she doesn't share my position on these issues.)",0,1414046196,null,0,1414047501,0,clhchv8,t3_2jzxyv,t1_clhchv8,t1_clhc9ot,null,1426392474,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

The first goal was 95% brilliant play by Real Madrid, the precision and speed of the passing and the perfect first time finish. If you freeze it when the pass is played yes Lovren is half a step forward but the line is pretty good (certainly nothing like skrtel's rush out against crystal palace last season, or Lovren against spurs this season). Skrtel's cover is good. Any other team that move breaks down and no one says anything about it. Second goal is standard johnson far post defending, it hapened on the weekend and will continue to happen as long as rodgers keeps selecting him. Third goal it's skrtel's man who wins the initial ball, balotelli, lovren and lovren's man all jump for the ball but none are tall enough. The ball should be cleared by skrtel before mignolet's lack of bravery.

Lovren did make a couple of errors but he did a lot more good than bad, several good interceptions especially when left exposed second half. I guess part of the reason for the criticism is his style. If you're an aggressive defender you'll always have a mix of balls you win well and those you get beaten on. Its fine margins and often a matter of perception.

The education system here is far more strict and requires a much higher level of study. Here, 70% is considered a really good mark on an exam. Getting 90% on an exam or paper is pretty unusual. It's possible, but you really have to study. I spent my entire last year of my last degree in the library. You need to be able to write a good essay and have good grammar skills. I once used an American system of notation (Harvard) and was marked down severely for using it. I marked it down to experience, but I wished I had asked my tutor what notation system I should use. 

On a positive note, there are many wonderful universities here in the UK and you will broaden your horizons a lot by studying here. Find a good uni and enjoy yourself, but apply yourself, too. Be willing to go the extra mile for something you are submitting as a piece of work. It will be very different to the level you are used to working at in the US. 

Edit: I received a first-class degree. These are hard to come by over here. 12 hours a day in the library for 12 months. I started my dissertation 10 months before the rest of my class. I was one of 3 out of 30 to graduate on time. You'll only be here for a semester, according to your post, so be clever and have fun. And when you get a good mark, don't compare it to American marks.

 Firstly it is an ethical failing on behalf of Facebook and the tax consultants. [Secondly, the government is doing stuff - even giving HMRC an extra billion to help reduce the problem](https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/reducing-tax-evasion-and-avoidance)

But thirdly, the main problem is tax havens - when their revenues go through other countries over which we have no jurisdiction. When this occurs, the government can't do very much before it starts violating foreign sovereignty. It is not gross incompetence to have problems dealing with this as this kind of tax evasion is incredible difficult and costly to prosecute. We (UK, US, Germany and France) are starting to pressure tax havens more and more, and in response Monaco suggested it was a victim of bullying because other countries were 'jealous' of its success. 

And it is difficult, we can't just instantly gut other countries to ensure our tax is paid. We have to slowly force them to change their business model sustainably, so they continue to grow but not off our lost tax revenues. We recently forced Jersey to become more transparent with its accounts, but these things have to be incremental otherwise we would go too far.

The government doesn't find this legal or acceptable, I highly doubt they are eager to have less money for the budget, particularly at a time when there are nearly weekly protests for an end to austerity. If the tories found an extra billion or so from big multinationals, and put it into the NHS, they would nullify Labour's major criticism of them and probably win the election tomorrow. So the government has every incentive to crack down on this, but it is incredibly difficult, exacerbated by the recession and restricted budgets. 

So while the government should do better, but pinning the blame entirely on them seems to be a satisfaction of ideology that is wilfully ignorant of the multitude of moral failings in the tax havens, the big multinationals, the tax consultants, and the difficulty in correcting them.",0,1414052749,null,0,false,0,clhduj2,t3_2k1qpj,t1_clhduj2,t1_clhcr49,null,1426391843,18,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,18

But it seems like Rodgers does not want to do that and believes his game will be good enough at the end of the season. I trust him on that part, but still do not understand why we are looking so bad defensively. 

A defensive midfielder is a must, someone like what we had in Lucas (in his prime) and Macherano/Sissoko. We miss such a player in the team, that can help out the defence and run like a maniac. 

There is also a need for one more offensive target, as much as i like Lambert as a player he is not what we needed. I would have been happy having him as a third striker if we got someone similar to Sturridge. 

Will wait with my judgement on Balotelli until after this season, then we will see if he was a good buy or not. I just hope that the coaching team does see the problems we got and buy accordingly next summer. Need to improve our first 11 at this point.

false,the-londoner,lfc68,,"As poor as our defence was (and it really really was), I don't get what all the fuss is about - except from Phil McNulty because he's a twat. We knew we were never going to beat them deep down, unless every one of our players turned it on. People saying its a reminder of how far we've fallen since '09 (McNulty) don't seem to remember that we're not only going through transition since then, but also from last season. 

We lost 50+ goals and assists through Suarez going and Sturridge being injured, but people brush this point aside as if Barca wouldn't struggle without Messi and Neymar, Bayern without Ribery and Robben, Real without Ronaldo and....any one of their ridiculously good forwards. Having seen the performance, I'm pretty confident that if Suarez and Sturridge were playing for us still, we'd actually have got something from that game. 

We can still very realistically get 2nd - I'd back us to beat Basel and Ludogorets with our full squad fit and firing. But the league is our top priority, and I'd argue it should be for the next two seasons anyway. 

Mario wasn't relatively bad last night; Rodgers will either have to play him in a 2 man strike force or drop him because everyone bar him atm seems to realise he won't work as a lone striker. Once Sturridge is back and in tandem with him, I think he could pay off. 

What IS a real issue with the team is the defence. In 2011-12 under Kenny, Agger and Skrtel formed the joint 3rd tightest defence in the league, despite finishing fucking eighth. That is how good a partnership they formed. IMO, Rodgers worst transfer decision in his time at the club is letting Agger go. I was sceptical of Lovren and have been proven right unfortunately. Sakho looked promising but overall the whole back line (and GK) needs proper coaching, something neither Rodgers nor his staff seem to be able to provide. Getting a new CB, and a new GK, as well as proper coaching staff is vital. ",0,1414054462,null,0,false,0,clhe5d0,t3_2k10wk,t1_clhe5d0,t3_2k10wk,null,1426391703,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

It's not the NFL where you have defensive coaches and offensive coaches and you have 2 different parts of a team, this is one unit designed to play a specific way and is being exposed. Teams know we're vulnerable in numerous ways and now sit on Gerrard to reduce his influence. Having a weak flapping goalie doesn't help the defence either. My main concern is Mignolet not being brave enough to be a goalie, he leads with his legs. For their 3rd goal why didn't he dive on the ball? Even if he doesn't get there and he just risks getting kicked in the head/face it'd be a foul but instead he dives in legs first in his own box. Likewise for the one on one save against Ronaldo, he seems to prefer getting his legs in the way rather than his upper body.  

Having a soft goalie then leads to mistakes with the defenders, Lovren and Skrtel are all over the place and don't seem to trust him. They always end up in two minds of should we drop off or do we close down but end up doing a bad combination of both.

Only having Gerrard back deep when he's 34 is also a problem to me, he's being asked to cover an awful lot of ground along with having a goalie I doubt he trusts right behind him and 2 defenders either side of him with the same issue.

Real made a few defensive mistakes, with Lallana and Allen going very close, and Coutinho hit the post, any other day it would have been 3-3. Real capitalized on our mistakes twice. Their first goal was class from Ronaldo, for their 2nd we needed to close down Kroos and stop the cross, and their 3rd...what was Mignolet doing? Does he know keepers can use their hands? That is the difference between a decent goalkeeper and a top one, someone like Neur, or Courtois would have dived on top of that ball and taken any hit just to stop the ball going in. Mignolet doesn't seem to have the desire to put in 100% effort to stop the ball.

  Our midfield was decent, I thought Allen played well, but he needs to clear the ball quicker. Hendo needs to close down quicker and get closer to his man. You can afford to give a Charlie Adam a extra foot of room, but James Rodriquez? You are asking to get hurt.

  Ballotelli was poor, I have never seen a football look so bored before. He is slouching everywhere and just doesn't seem to want to play. I feel like with Sturridge upfront we would have had more urgency and pace in our attacks, also we would have caught real on the break a lot more.

  Overall it was an alright performance, vs the top teams you can't afford to make mistakes, but compared to our performances vs Ludograts and Basel, this was much better. Play like that vs them (minus the defence) and we should qualify easily. Just scared about the next round...

I would say it isn't just the defence that are causing these problems, we also don't have enough protection from the midfield or even the strikers as the pressing from last season has been lost. I think it was Carragher that said it last night, Liverpool should completely stop worrying about being an attacking team and even stop worrying about the result, just completely focus on getting a few clean sheets under our belt to get that much needed confidence back into our defence. 

To sort this out from open play we need to move Gerrard into a more forward position with a proper dm (Lucas or Can) behind him and Henderson, this way we will have the expansive play of Gerrard but hopefully we will have more defensive cover with the dedicated DM. What we do about the individual errors from set pieces I have no idea, hopefully if Liverpool can get some confidence back that will sort itself out. Also Sakho coming back will hopefully give us some much needed fight at the back because lately we seem to be being bullied by the attackers. Something else that needs to be sorted out is the fact that we continue to put ourselves under pressure by needlessly playing it out the back when being pressed high by the opposition causing us to make stupid mistakes.

false,pharao007,null,null,"&gt; As I have already said, the issue of Euroscepticism is large enough to form a group, around 100 MEPs from almost all member states

The sole idea they can't organise themselves into one strong group means how different they are and what are their real basis of Euroscepticism. Farage doesn't want to get involved with some of them simply because they are..... racist or similar, hence their Euroscepticism shouldn't be taken serious if that's their only point of view on the subject.

&gt;It is incredibly undemocratic to say that just because they are not in one party, they should not be given the chance to speak about the issue as much as any other important EU issue.

No, in fact that only proves the point the concept is correct. Those parties are so ""weird"" they can't form a group, hence should not be getting extra time for speaking or extra funding.

&gt;What? No, the reason Germany France and the UK haven formed one group is that there is no political appetite to do so. You are confusing yourself, you came up with an example and now your are thinking about it as if it was a reality.

That's your explanation...... which means exactly that if there was enough political appetite, then Farage would have easilry formed that group. Right? He can't do it easily, hence the rule works exactly as planned. You are basically contradicting yourself here.

&gt;Yeah, the millions of people who are concerned about immigration are only that way because they are too stupid to think for themselves. The reason Euroscepticism is a growing force is that people like you would rather insult and put down people with genuine concerns than actually have a discussion and come to a comprises on the issue.

Where have I insulted you? In fact, I'm often being insulted by guys who oppose with my views, yet can't even explain why..... I'm discussed this topic countless of times and made some personal research as well. Majority of those concerns are blown out of proportions and not your ""genuine concerns"". I'm sorry but in my view, some of those people are simply racist and xenophobic (some are open, some are not about it), other group within is simply terribly misinformed (including by media!), another still thinks in Imperialism values and treats all other countries as third world..... that is the reality, not the real concerns as I've analysed and thrown nearly all of them or at least put a cast of doubt (which would mean ""we don't know"", rather than ""it's definitely bad"").

&gt;Getting time to speak in parliament is THE goal of any MEP, party or group.

Farage's goal is again, to quit the EU, NOT change it and he doesn't hide it. I'm really surprised I have to tell it to you for like 10th time.

&gt;And I notice you didn't comment on my question about the Greens and SNP being in the same group. Its very telling which questions you choose to not answer.

You are comparing apples with oranges here. Scotland being independent vs some MEPs being holocaust deniers is I would say pretty different, isn't it? In fact, I've just found it: [link](http://www.scottishgreens.org.uk/news/independence-convention/) - *Greens support independence, if or when the people support it, and see the Convention as a way to promote debate across Scotland.* 

&gt;You have just gone on and on about how if Euroscepticism was a big deal their would be more MEPs wanting to join Farages group, now you are saying that Euro sceptics should not vote for them in the EU elections! Make up your mind, what is it?

Come on, use your brain and respond to some of rhetoric yourself, rather than ask for obvious. You are putting Euroscepticism (again) in the same bag. Do you know for example that Germany's main Euroscepticism is actually about the currency, not the whole union? Not all Euro-sceptic parties want to withdraw from the EU..... but UKIP does, maybe that's why he can't easily find enough parties for the group, who are also not known for being racist or similar.

&gt;To repeat what I said. UKIP vote no to prevent the EU gaining any more power. This seems like a good idea for a party who are opposed to EU expansion doesn't it?

That's because they can't do anything more as there isn't enough support for the EU exit, nor they can actually do make that happen from within the EU. This means that even though they don't like the EU and would like to quit it, they are actually working on changing it.... hence do the opposite what they base their principles on. Also, they have to do something there...... so probably figured out they will do that, rather than complete nothing.

&gt;How does voting UKIP stop black and Muslim immigration?

Exactly! Point that question to people who think like that, not me. Ignorance? Lack of knowledge? Protest vote as they can't vote for a party which would attack solely non-EU migration as there isn't one?

&gt;If you are a union which over they years has become more and more politically intertwined, lead by people who have specifically said they want there to be a United States of Europe, have suggested things like a European Army, then creating your own flag and anthem to many will be a sign that you want to completely federalise Europe without the consent of the people, and that will worry many people.

Let's say that EU really is going into that direction. UK doesn't like it, just QUIT the EU!!! There, problem solved. Unless of course that country would oppose there being a country that big next to them (I imagine Russia is hence hating the EU).... but they would have to give their real concerns first. That's all of course assuming the EU is wanting to be the new USA, which I strongly doubt as for example your basis for that is ""Some MEP gave an idea for EU army"".... as I don't recall anywhere being the official EU policy to make such. Even if they wanted though, it still wouldn't be much different than for example why we are in NATO though. Just that NATO also has US, Turkey and few more non-EU countries.

On the other hand though, following your thought of concern, I would be more concerned that UKIP is going into the Hitler's direction. After all, plenty of points they do and make is common to what Hitler did...... Shall we assassinate Farage while there is still time? (lol)

&gt;If you agree with what UKIP are trying to do the the EU, trying to reduce its power over the UK, then it would be stupid not to vote for them. Sorry, you are just being ridiculous.

People vote UKIP mainly because they don't want to be in the EU itself (look recent research about it, if I remember correctly only around 12% of UKIP supporters wanted to remain in the EU). 

&gt;What you are suggesting makes absolutely no sense whatsoever!

Again, it does make sense. UKIP wants to quit the EU, NOT change it and that's their main point. However, they can't achieve that in the UK, so meddle within the EU or to be exact, take EU's money and use it as their campaign for EU exit (as well as publicity).

&gt;By looking at the change over time. Parties like UKIP are growing in support. If that support starts to fall I will recognise that.

The recent poll has shown that UK's support for the EU is strongest it has been for very long time.... but that of course is ""just"" a poll.

&gt;The only way to change the EU is to change the rules on free movement of people. Limit immigration, because that is the issue people care about.

Rather than limit free movement I'd prefer UK voting to exit the EU. I don't want to start the subject why I think people are very wrong about it....... but in very short - misinformation, prejudice, personal advantages (like hiding laziness behind ""immigrant took my job"") and plenty of other ones. Right wing mass media only fuel that and I've proven it myself by pointing out huge inaccuracies in the Daily Mail, when it writes on immigration and the EU.

&gt;Again, as I said, there are around 100 fully Euro sceptic MEPs. Add to that the parties which have promised a referendum if they are elected, such as the conservatives, and you can see that in the UK at least, the majority of people voted for parties which will give them the opportunity to leave the EU. The same may be the case across the EU.

If that is reality and the support is such strong, then nothing will stop them to reach their goal of either reforming the EU and some countries exiting it.

I came to England in 2010 to do a Masters, from India. In the Induction week at my uni, there was a day we had to go in and have all our paperwork checked. Visas, admissions, tuitions, ID checks, etc. So I went in with almost every single document that was relevant to me as an immigrant, all in one pretty folder. This folder also had other important documents which were not so relevant to that day. All in all, it contained: 

- Passport 
- Stamped Visa
- Unconditional offer for admission to the Uni 
- my original birth certificate 
- my insurance documents 
- my bank statements 
- my residency details, i.e. landlords in the area. 
- 200 pounds worth of traveller checks.

And I left this on the bus back home to my new rented flat, by mistake. In my first week in a foreign country, I was at that point, virtually a ghost.  

That night, I shat so many bricks when I realized it was missing, I could fit stuff a pillow with them. 

My landlord calmly told me to go to the Stagecoach office the next morning and report it, before calling any authorities about it. 

And there it was! I began to describe what it looked like, when I realised it was on a shelf behind the bloke I was talking to!

*Have*. As in *Did*. Not *Do*. Historical events are a great way to ignore current progress - do we celebrate gay marriage, or should we not because it was illegal for so long?

&gt;it's not relative when you invoke the behaviour of a religion based in a country that hasn't even had the equivalent of a sexual revolution

Of course it is. Many of the global conflicts going on right now are due to the invoking of intolerant religions. People who still follow a 900-years-out-of-date (or worse) manual will act that way. And many countries (say, India) hadn't had a sexual revolution when we took them over - not surprising, as most of the world hadn't (again, context). Many *still haven't*.

&gt;You can take your Stalins, Hitlers, Napoleons and Khans and combine ALL their numbers and still fall well short.

So no *true* Scotsman, then - unless you want to give a figure of numbers that are 'allowed' to be killed before your reasoning takes precedence.

&gt;Not in the 1940's we weren't.

You're suggesting we weren't committing women to asylums for pregnancy in the 40's? Or imprisoning gays? Or (until the latter part of that decade) bothering with social welfare or the NHS? There are plenty more examples. It doesn't take much context for your examples to fall apart, because they're from so long ago. And the fact that we killed many doesn't change my point - do we remind each of these territories of their past when addressing current events?

&gt;You keep on about the fact that we did all this so very long ago.

No, you keep using key facts out of context, and I explain why that's a bit silly.

&gt;There are still people alive that were involved in these activities.

I'm not sure what difference that makes. Do we still persecute Germany because some of our (and their) soldiers are still alive? And to repeat my earlier example, do we celebrate gay marriage as progress, or do we not encourage others to follow our example because it only happened recently and we should still be feeling guilty?

&gt;Why should we hold them to our standards when they are only doing what we were less than a lifetime ago?

Because we've already been there, done that - giving us (and everyone else) hindsight that some other countries simply don't have (and therefore can't claim ignorance on). They can either learn from our cultural and political history and avoid those mistakes, or they can carry on with honour killings/ repressing women/ etc. because (according to you) we have no right to criticise based on the history of an empire that hasn't existed for at least sixty years that virtually none of us participated in.

1) The introduction of a minimum wage artificially increases the price for labour. This minimum wage affects all workers equally regardless of age/sex/other characteristic.

3)When the price of labour increases the amount of people wanted to be employed will increase. This is because given a fixed number of hours in the day people are more likely to want to work rather then have leisure time. 

4) As the supply has increased whilst the demand has fallen there will be unemployed people.

5) Young people are less productive then older people. This is because they have less experience, training in any given job. As they are more productive the employeers make more money/are more productive by employing them rather than young people.

6) For a given price of labour equal between old and young, old people are more likely to be employed. 

7) Therefore the unemployed are more likely to be young.  

8) Were a lower minimum wage introduced for younger workers they are more likely to be employed then before. This is because for a fixed wage bill more young people can be hired than old, this outweighs the effect of them being less productive individually.

Fantastic, thank you, that clears up a lot. It's also really useful to know the technical term!

&gt; Depending on your employer's contribution level, it may still be worth making pension contributions over ISAs. The sums are complicated and you should speak to somebody who will charge you a reasonable fee to undertake them if it's a serious concern (or work them out yourself!)

Yeah, it's going to be a bit of a guessing game too ( / risk analysis). If my free cash goes down in the future, then I'm less likely to hit the limit and therefore would be better putting some away now, if I retire earlier on ISA investments then I'm putting in for less time ... Oh for a crystal ball :)

I think at least though both options are fairly sensible currently, put some in an ISA, quite a lot into a pension. I'm also pretty early on in this so I've got quite a while to work it out. 

I think I'll try and work out the numbers and see how various different plans work out to get a feel for how much of an impact they'd have, make sure I understand where I currently am and then go and speak to someone.

false,Evis03,null,null,"The LTA is the total value of your entire pension fund. This is not the same as what you pay in.

You may however want to worry about the annual allowance, which is a limit on how much your pension can grow each year.

There are not many pensions that allow you to take money out once it is in. You can usually claim (with limitations) a refund, but a pension isn't a bank account. Typically once money is in there you don't get it back until it's time to claim your pension, and then you get it back on the terms of your pension scheme. 

The LTA is applied at the point you claim your pension, so as far as I am aware once you have paid that 'penalty' it doesn't matter. The pension is now in payment. In theory this means if you had a way to lower the value of your pension you could do it just before drawing it, but as I said I don't know of a pension that allows you to draw money out of it beyond full refunds. And if your pension is backed by investment (rather than say the government) it may go down with bad planning, but i doubt you would have much, if any, control over that.

Some schemes offer stuff like draw down that let you start drawing your pension early, but I would assume (read assume here) such payments would count towards your life time allowance.

I'd speak with a financial advisor. A single appointment would probably clear up everything for you and leave you with a solid, long term plan. Also, speak to the administrators of your scheme.

- you'll be taxed highly, but only on the amount above £1.25m, so it won't be as bad as it first seems.  it will also mean you have a very healthy looking pension, which is a good thing. you realise that, i'm sure, but just worth mentioning.

- the £1.25m number is likely to move, but i would argue that in 30 years or so (assuming you're &lt;30), it should probably go up.  the real value of £1m when we retire will be more like £500k, and that WILL capture a lot of the population.  they will have to start moving this threshold with inflation at some point...

- you can take steps to minimise this.  As you say, putting money in ISAs or other tax-free investments (NS&amp;I) is a good start.  it won't get you any tax relief, but will avoid extra tax charges. you could also put it in your significant other's pension, if they exist, or even invest it on behalf of your children (either a JISA or their pension, which also gets tax relief up to a certain amount).",0,1414059758,null,0,false,0,clhf1bb,t3_2k2xix,t1_clhf1bb,t3_2k2xix,null,1426391222,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2

So if you decided that in you first year of retirement you need £30,000 net of basic rate tax then you would crystallise £35,294.11

 Your first 25% would be tax free (£8,823.53) and the remaining £26,640 would be taxed at 20% (net payment being £21,176.47).

This way would only have the amount you need tested against the lifetime allowance with the hope that the lifetime allowance is increased to allow for inflationary erosion of the tax privileged amount you can withdraw. 

The lifetime allowance has come from £1.8m at its peak to £1.25m and there is political pressure from Lib Dem and Labour to reduce to £1m. 

The main advantage of pensions over ISA is the higher contribution limits and inheritance tax free status if the correct trust is utilised against the lack of access until minimum retirement age. 

That said monies can be ""parked"" in ISA to nearer retirement age and then as long as earnings allow placed into pension have benefited from tax free growth.

These girls want to be backstage and some of them may even romanticise sleeping with one of the band - but when it comes to the actual process of getting backstage they're competing with dozens of other girls - they literally get lined up and may be asked to perform sex acts there and then to get a pass. Or what they see as a night with their favourite rock-star becomes an orgy with the whole band, roadies, other groupies included.

Then the next morning they find themselves cast aside with the beer cans and used condoms and wondering what happened. Perhaps wondering for themselves if the things they did were worth it, perhaps feeling used - because they certainly were.

The problem lies with a mixture of lack of confidence at the back and Mignolet being a pretty poor goalie bar shot stopping, in the game last night he even went for the ball with his feet for the 3rd goal which is inexcusable. You never see Migs barking orders and organising the defence, which in turn has our defenders second guessing him which leads on to simple errors where both goalie and defender end up going for the same ball or worse neither do.

&gt;a less experienced person doesn't have a right to demand the same pay as a more experienced person.

They do if they're performing the same task to the same standard. 

If you don't believe the minimum wage should be the minimum wage for everybody, why believe in a minimum wage at all? Maybe you think disabled people should have a lower minimum too?

&gt; the simplest way to legislate that is by differentiating on grounds of age.

Differentiating on grounds of age doesn't pay any regard whatsoever to experience. Unless you think that there's some universal rule that older people are better coffee baristas.

&gt;I'm not particularly fussed if some teenagers can't piss and extra pound or two away a week, sorry.

The reason you're not particularly fussed is that the lower minimum wage for 18-20 year olds is a nice way for you to convince yourself you're worth more than them.

You aren't.

In ""To Play the King"", Kitty Aldridge plays Sarah Harding, a pollster who can produce any result desired by appropriately manipulating the poll question. This a very fine example of her kind of work: it stays within the boundaries of what appears to be acceptable, but still frames the question in such a way as to maximize the likelihood of the desired response.

""If you died, would you like your children to be adopted by two homosexual men?"" It's very clear that most people would reply ""no"" simply because they'd rather have their children stay with their *other parent* or other members of the family before being adopted by strangers.

No, let's look at a [poll](https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/959/UK-Attitudes-To-Adoption.aspx) that as far as possible tries not to elicit a specific answer:

&gt; Currently a single gay or lesbian person who has passed all the required vetting procedures can legally adopt a child. Where the gay or lesbian person is in a stable, long-term relationship only one partner and not both can legally adopt the child. Both will have been vetted as suitable and both will be looking after the child.
&gt; 
&gt; Q4. To what extent do you agree or disagree that the law should be changed so that couples like this are eligible to adopt a child jointly?

It seems as we've always been the cusp of a CB crisis since the last 3 seasons due to injury, form, etc.  Or maybe we get lucky and Wisdom grows into the beast we imagined.Strong, mean, nasty GK; a Diego Lopez type.

It's infuriating watching our defensive squiggly shape and not a defensive line that actually moves together.And most importantly as you mentioned, bring in Carra!

The problem is in the other 6/7 who did have a ""job"", there are a lot who were either employed by political parties (approximately 1 in 7).  There are also those who worked in ""Business"" (approximately another 1.5 in 7).

Now how many of these people actually did actual jobs and how many, like Cameron, Milliband or Cleggy, had do-nothing, free pay cheques from companies run by their school friends or members of their immediate families?

Anyone can work for a political party for a year if their dad is a donor.  Anyone can be played to play golf when their brother is the CEO.  But when they are putting their CV together they claim to be grass roots organisers and businessmen.

And this is without getting into either the number of solicitors (I'll give Barraster a pass since it's meant to be quite demanding) or how many of those ""miners"" have ever actually been in a mine or how many of those university lecturers really lectured for an hour a week while doing a PhD in sucking up to the local party committee?

I am not placing the blame on Balotelli, but why are we setting up the same way with the same players expecting drastic differences. Now that we don't have the firepower, it's also apparent that Gerrard cannot play the position he is. What happens is that he sinks in almost always way too close to our back-line because he doesn't have the quickness to go out and make those tackles.

I also have questions with Johnson pushing Manquillo to the bench when he came back from injury. 

Also I have some problems with Rodgers blaming the players after every game and never get close to take some of the blame, even though the formation/tactics clearly didn't help our situation in some games. 

When Sturridge comes back and we can play Sturridge+Balo up top I think we will be very good again, almost all of our midfielders played well yesterday and it is looking promising, specially Lallana, Sterling and Coutinho, while Henderson/Gerrard just have to continue to deliver stable performances.

false,q_pop,null,null,"The biggest danger with sticking £200k in the bank is the risk that the ""real"" value of your capital will erode - i.e. that inflation will reduce the value more quickly than the interest will increase it.

This is why people tend to place longer-term funds into stocks &amp; shares investments or property - you are trading capital security (the fact that your money shouldn't ever be lost in a bank account) for the potential to outpace inflation by way of income payments and capital growth.

/u/dustofnations has kindly provided the *excellently written* (if I do say so myself) FAQ page for just this kind of question.

I would also mention that you now have the opportunity to buy a house outright as /u/ahhyes mentions, but you may want to consider if this is preferable to taking advantage of historically low interest rates and obtaining a small mortgage. 

This frees up more cash to achieve other aims with.

What I would absolutely do in the first instance is ""ring-fence"" the money. Given your stated ignorance to money, a dangerous trap to fall into is the ""ahh well I have the money now, I can afford x y z"" and suddenly the funds are frittered away.

By all means fritter some, it's your prerogative, but perhaps considering putting, say, 99% into separate accounts, and leaving yourself 1% (£2,000!) of frivolity.

It should also be mentioned that the UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) only covers deposits of up to £85,000 in the even of a bank going bust. Whilst this outcome is unlikely, I'm sure it would be pretty upsetting if it did happen. Maybe consider splitting the funds into £80,000 lumps and spreading them between banks.

Make sure, if you do that, to pick banks that use **different banking licenses** - for example, Natwest and RBS use the same banking license, as do Halifax, AA Savings, BM Savings, and so on. The £85,000 limit is per banking license as opposed to per bank brand.

What's interesting is that many jurisdictions define age of consent as a mental age, not a chronological one.  That is so that the mentally handicapped can still be protected under age-of-consent laws.  Once you accept that you can be chronologically 20 but mentally 14, it also follows that you can be chronologically 14 and mentally 16.  That's when you get the judge involved.

Interestingly, it used to be a defence in the US to show that the girl was not previously ""chaste"", i.e. if she was already promiscuous then she was obviously capable of consenting.  I'm not sure how valid that logic is, but it was certainly in law.

In short: I'm trying to say that ""rape"" is an incredibly emotive term to throw around, and human sexuality is complicated enough that it seems ""statuatory"" is too blunt an instrument to me.  I'd rather see these cases judged and punished individually by judges.",0,1414069192,null,0,1414069550,0,clhhavh,t3_2k2ulj,t1_clhhavh,t1_clhgo9n,null,1426390165,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

false,DanNeedleman,null,null,"Here's my analysis of the situation as to why there's so much ""outrage"":

1.  Last season - We overachieved, something that has been said again and again by  management and the pundits, this has had an effect on the Anfield faithful and alot of bandwagon fans. There is no doubt in my mind that last season brought back a whole bunch of armchair fans who had been missing since the Torres days (or even further back) and it's those people who are the main proponents of outrage atm.

2. Balotelli - I'm a believer in Balotelli because I feel he's been isolated up top. The British press has it's perfect storm, one of it's most historically popular clubs and one of the world's most controversial players. The press is whipping up this storm about Balo 100% and that includes the pundits. Carra was overall very complimentary about Balo last night and his comments with regards to ""not being here next summer"" were picked out. We've lost 80% of our goals and Balotelli shouldn't be expected to replace that in an unfamiliar system.

3.  Fans - I touched upon this earlier, but every club has ridiculous fans. Hindsight is 20/20 and the same people clamouring for a marquee signing 3 months ago are the same people who want Balo out right now. the fans themselves are contradictory, all the shouts to give Borini a chance when everyone was saying he wasn't worthy of the shirt, it's ridiculous.

Realistically I'm amazed that we're in outrage now. We're 5th in the table having played 3 of last years top 6, with our closest competitor being Man United who have played all 3 newly promoted teams, AND we still have a good chance of making it past the group stages. We're not doing well, but points and positions don't lie.",0,1414069240,null,0,false,0,clhhbgz,t3_2k37ih,t1_clhhbgz,t3_2k37ih,null,1426390157,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

I didn't see Robinson at all, because I avoided it. ""We all saw"" is a shitty phrase, best kept for world cup final replays and not for subjectivity.

The video showing his answer - The questions are very reasonable, they are reporting the factual news back to Salmond as a question. He starts off at best coldly, possibly rudely. He then continues to 'answer' the question, ""I think the people of Scotland have moved beyond these warnings"". Two members of government said different things! Government and organisations who want the same result said the same thing months apart! Salmond quotes the CEO saying they aren't moving, is that somehow the absolute truth now? A threat of investigation is entirely the wrong thing for a politician to say, especially there, but he may be right on there being an investigation. He then moves on, having not answered the question. You say he answered it perfectly well, please point out where, a timecode. The whole corporation tax depends on where they're active? Then it's one side saying they're moving base, another side saying they're moving offices. We never got the final answer on that. We don't know who is right.

His whole response is mildly attacking, and aimed at the BBC and Robinson which makes it unsuitable for some broadcast purposes. Robinson was hardly a dick, because when he pressed for an answer he got something usable out of Salmond. Salmond, the embodiment of one side of the argument can't be used for an objective claim of bias.

This book was written by the father of ""value investing"", and the mentor of Warren Buffett, who is widely accepted to be the world's most successful investor. 

It was originally published in 1948, but Ben Graham updated it periodically over the years, and it stands as true today as it ever has.

**[Beating the Street - Peter Lynch](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Beating-Street-Peter-Lynch/dp/0671891634/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1394958226)**

Published in 1994, this is arguably showing its age more than Intelligent Investor. Either way, valuable reading from one of the best managers of money in the past few decades.

**[Naked Trader - Robbie Burns](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Naked-Trader-anyone-trading-shares/dp/0857191705/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1394958400)**

Subtitled ""How anyone can make money trading shares"", this is an entertaining, tongue-in-cheek account of one financial journalist's attempt to quit his job and make £1,000,000 using a short-to-medium term trading strategy. Not very scientific, but an interesting counterpoint to the previous recommendations.

**[Smarter Investing - Tim Hale](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Smarter-Investing-Simpler-Decisions-Financial/dp/0273785370/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1394958561)**

The ultimate counterpoint to attempting to ""beat the markets"" - after spending 15 years working in active fund manager, Tim Hale concluded that the best outcomes for most investors in most situations would be a simple portfolio of ""passive"" investments (that is, funds which attempt to track a market, rather than outperform it). This style is favoured by the likes of Monevator, and many of the subscribers here.

**[Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder letters - Warren Buffett](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/letters.html)**

Not a book, but a series of essays over the years from the world's most successful investor. Makes interesting reading! Notably, the 2014 letter (not published in the above link but published [here in abridged form](http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2014/02/24/warren-buffett-berkshire-letter/)) implies that he now feels most investors would be best served by low-cost trackers.

**[The Financial Times guide to investing - Glen Arnold](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Financial-Times-Guide-Investing/dp/027372374X)**

A great starter guide, going from the very basics (why businesses need shareholders) to more in-depth explanations of different types of investment, and step-by-step guides on how to execute trades.

I'd go for Smarter Investing for a no-nonsense starter guide or the FT Guide to investing for a thorough overview.

Dirk Kuyt had a dreadful first touch but he was loved because he would bust a lung fighting for the team and that's why he was so successful here. Mario just does not seem to have the fight in him and it's really worrying.

Another reason for the steadying increase in apathy towards Mario is purely tactical. Last season we thrived with a pressing system where everybody understood their role. Sturridge slotted into the team effortlessly when we signed him because he is a player capable of working with the team and as well as achieving outstanding, individual feats of brilliance. Mario is only capable of the latter, and he is only capable of doing it rarely. He just does not seem on the same  wavelength with the rest of the team and I fear that playing in Italy, where players have much more time and space, has made him complacent on the ball.

I feel BR broke down the teams attacking spirit by that sub, you can argue whether or not Balo should have started this match, but he was not the worst player on the pitch and all of the attacking play died when he got subbed. I feel since BR chose to start Balo there is no reason for subbing him before ca the 60 minute mark if he's not injured. Doesn't really show a lot of faith to pull him off at half time and not even replacing him with a striker.

If this sub didn't show the lack of desire to at least try to get something out of this match, the double substitution where BR subbed off Henderson who'd been as usual working good, and Coutinho who  was the most lively player on the pitch. I don't want to talk shit about Markovic and Emre Can, but especially Emre Can didn't feel like a player you'd put on when you want to score goals. I'll admit to not having watched on after this substitution due to my dinner being ready then and I felt BR threw in the towel with this substitutions.

Poor match from a tactical point of view, until Real scored their first the match was even but after that, and especially after the second half started the team was just plain and simple poor and Real would probably have scored a few more if they too hadn't slowed down a bit and started to think about their next match against Barca.

People talking shit about Balo and Johnson in particular I feel are just silly, yes neither player was great but was there any LFC player that was great during this match?

Balo was maybe not effective in the attack bought at least the presence of an attacker made the team more attacking than after he'd been subbed.

Johnson handled Ronaldo quite well I feel, I was quite nervous thinking about that matchup before the match but I think Johnson did quite well and hope he's on the right track once again, sure he did a few mistakes but I doubt there are many players in the world who can defend in 90 minutes against one of the world's best players without making a single mistake.

I am realistic, and have been downvoted in this sub for years for saying it (feel free to hunt my posts down), but the EL is a bullshit competition (mainly because of CL clubs dropping down if they fail in the CL group stages), the CL spot for the winner is a token effort to make it more appealing.

Either we accept we are a 2nd tier club, competing with everyone else for relatively minor trophies, or we push for our time at the very top. I want to experience being the best club in the country, and it's not going to happen if we keep going for everything.

Look at the big clubs, to compete in Europe and the league you need 2 world class teams, and noone can afford that without a sugar daddy or regular CL. To get in the CL, we need to forget going for cups for a few years. Or do become what we all would have a love/hate relationship with and do it how City and Chelsea have done it.

That's absolutely not what I'm saying though. Context is everything. Let's break down the context of Stephen Fry's remarks:

* There is a drive to arrest celebrities for historic sex acts with minors
* Stephen Fry is an openly gay man
* He has a history of dating men much younger than himself
* Historic ages of consent for homosexual acts have been much higher in the past than now
* He is also a celebrity and therefore potentially at risk of being investigated

So no, thinking that this is becoming a bit of a witch hunt doesn't mean you must be a paedophile or have committed sexual assault. But when you're talking about a gay celebrity with a history of younger partners and the consent law has only recently been changed you'd be a mug not to be suspicious. Given that the age of consent for homosexual acts used to be 21 I would not be surprised if almost every openly gay celebrity of Stephen's age had done something with someone who - at the time, according to the laws of the time - was underage.

So to use your pot legalisation example, it's not that anyone who wants it legalised must smoke it. It's as if someone has said they want it legalised and they:

* Smoke pot substitutes (hypothetically - I have no idea if these exist) all the time
* Are always curiously hungry late at night and sometimes seem a bit spacey
* Spent a lot of time in countries where pot is legal but swear they'd never do it here where it's illegal

I think Fry's angle is that he's been in the factual position (in terms of age and circumstance) of the 'abused' and he feels it wasn't a crime - in fact for him it was probably his first significant relationship - and he doesn't believe we should be digging through history trying to dig up dirt on other people like his lover, because in his view (probably rightly) it was entirely loving.

But the thing is, I disagree. Because if Yewtree has shown anything, it's that victims have been coming forward for *years*. People, not like Fry, who feel they *were* attacked, who *weren't* in love. But the police did nothing. Nobody did anything. Even today, politicians conspire to destroy as much evidence of complaints as they can to hinder the current investigation.

Yewtree isn't about demonising every person who had a loving relationship outside the normal bounds of age, it's about recasting a glance over the years of abuse claims and beginning anew from the position that these people were telling the truth. And it's scary that in just a few months they managed to find dozens of corroborating witness testimony against certain persons who appear to be prolific abusers.

That police were sat on that the entire time, and it seems likely they colluded with politicians and the media to shut down cases prematurely as well, is the big problem and the reason we need Yewtree.",0,1414074384,null,0,false,0,clhje7s,t3_2k2ulj,t1_clhje7s,t1_clhdyg1,null,1426389188,44,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,44

On briefing Thatcher she'd demand detail to the smallest matter.

I think it's pretty unfair to say Margaret Thatcher, however one thinks of her, didn't understand the EEC or the situation in 1988.

&gt;Thatcher complains about centralisation but she centralised herself taking power away from local authorities. 

Thatcher warned about centralisation in Brussels.  Different thing.

Is this the same woman the nation hates for making cuts and privatising national holdings?

So the Europa League group stages are more exciting than the CL ones? Not arguing there. It's a shame the money and prestige aren't split depending on excitment.

If the CL was a true CL (winners of leagues + cups only) then my opinion would probably be drastically different, it's a shame it isn't like that. Imagine winning the EL and getting to play in the CL with about 8 other clubs, that would be amazing.

It's not like that though. CL is too inclusive because UEFA wants the cash, same with EL (which is why some CL group stage losers drop down).

The system can be redesigned to make the EL worth it. How about if the League cup + 2nd place PL team have a play off, and then another vs the FA cup winner, and go into a play off with other European teams who have qualified in a similar manner to play in an 8 team Champions League (not a league/knock out, but a league), then I would be saying let's go for everything.

I think the game plan of high press counter attacks doesn't work with Balotelli as a lone striker because there's no threat behind the defense. I think he needs someone to play off of, it seemed like Sterling was supposed to be that guy yesterday but not sure they ever completed a pass together.

The first 20 minutes were excellent and if we had Sturridge up top alongside Mario I wouldn't be surprised if we'd have  scored in that period. Problem is you can't play at that high a tempo for the whole game, especially against a team like Madrid. We couldn't do it last season either, remember the City game? After the first half an hour against them we pretty much dropped off for the rest of the game. The issue with playing like we do against these top sides is that if we don't get a 2-3 goal lead within the first 30 minutes, we're in trouble. Apart from the aerial balls I thought we defended alright yesterday. You can't really point at any one player and say they were absolutely dreadful. We had loads of 7/10 performances, however you need 10/10 performances to beat a side as good as Madrid. On the upside I think we needed this lesson, it's very similar to the away match at arsenal last season, where they completely outclassed us.

But you also have to take in to account that it is important that MPs do not, and indeed *should not*, spend all their time involved in politics.

Allowing sexual relations with large age gaps could enable some very abusive relationships.

false,jdhan2006,lfc68,,"1)  I actually think the fullbacks going forward is an accident.  There is no real direct 'force' heading straight to goal.  Sturridge and Suarez both did this.  Can did it last night.  Everyone just pushes it out wide and it allows the opposing midfielders to shut the players down so they pass it into space which pulls the full backs forward.  I agree though.  

2) Spot on.  Also the defensive shape against QPR was horrible, bad against Madrid but HORRIBLE against QPR.

3)  For a defender Johnson is really bad at this.  I'm fin with out short midfielders not winning headers, that is ok but they at least need to challenge them for it.  Make it more difficult not a free header.  

4)  I sometimes wonder if BR is trying to be cute and create a new position.  A DM that is also a CB.  If this is the case I'd prefer him to cut it the fuck out.  Especially as Gerrard is neither a CB nor a DM.  Can maybe, but it reeks of being too cute.  

5)  Has Mingolet improved at all since we got him in the ball playing aspect of his game?  Has his ability to handle corners improved at all since we got him?  

I don't think it is as easy as you say.  BR doesn't even know his best starting 11, the defense has zero confidence and every team knows the simple blueprint to beating LFC.  The summer signings: Markovic, Lambert, Balotelli look like the will not help this year.  Manquillo, Moreno, Lallana look good as does Can but none are superstars or above a costly mistake.  


But I have faith.  LFC are not a first half team, they take some time to gel and find their rhythm.  The fact that Liverpool are in fifth and are playing like this bodes well, they will, rightly, be knocked from the CL IMO and it is probably a good thing.

So, looking at the prices (and the fact I recently test drove one) I'd compare it to a 6 Series Diesel for my needs (You could have the M Sport Coupe, with all the whistles and bells for less..) it's definitely quicker off the mark by the best part of a second (BMW do 0-62, not 0-60), however you can get ~800 miles out of a tank in that.

If you want performance the petrol will do a similar 0-60 and you'll still get 400 miles out of a tank... and I can refill instantly being the key!

Got to say the savings based on the fuel are really attractive (looks like approx. £2k per year) but until the infrastructure is there or I can get the mileage I can't justify it.

I suppose that's a more fundamental change. But that's a new sub-institution within the EU. The UK isn't in the Euro. So, in terms of the UK's membership, our relationship hasn't fundamentally changed. But, say, Germany's, well that has.

&gt; Or that Thatcher looking forward in 1988 was talking about the future single market meaning deregulation, and that we haven't had a fundamental change in regulation?

No, we haven't. What Thatcher wanted didn't happen and we didn't deregulate. So there wasn't a fundamental change there.

&gt; Or Schengen. Schengen didn't fundamentally change the EEC model?

Schengen predates the UK joining! It's also separate from the EU. Are you sure you know what you're on about?

&gt; Or Thatcher warning that we shouldn't have an appointed bureaucracy and it should be council level managed, whereas it is now Commission lead with all legislation coming from its appointed members?

That has always been the case. The other organs can't propose legislation. Remember who appoints the Commission - the member states.

&gt; Or that it shouldn't become about collectivism, and now we have the ESM socialising and consolidating EU debt?

The Eurozone, yes. I already stated my position on that. And no, it's not really any more or less collectivist than before. We've had the bloody *CAP* for years now.

&gt; Or that it shouldn't become about corporatism whereas Brussels is now an epicentre of corporate lobbying, EU liberalism has lead to necessary privatisation, and we're seceding even sovereign powers to corporates and the commission with the likes of TTIP.

As if the EEC wasn't equally corporatist and liberal? There was a reason the British Left didn't want us to stay in it.

&gt; That's a pretty fundamental shift you've just downplayed.

Not... really. I said it's moving towards, I didn't say it is. Fundamentally it's still a collection of member states co-operating to make a supranational union. Now, after this year's elections it's becoming more Parliament-driven. But the key word is *becoming*.

&gt; That's a pretty fundamental change to sovereignty too - saying a sovereign country has less vetoes....and it's a lot less.

I don't see how sovereignty has anything to do with it. Bear in mind that treaty changes and certain other important things are still done by unanimity.

Balo would fit the system decently if Sturridge hadn't been out all year. We didn't just lose the 45 goals created by Suarez, we lost the 25 goals/assists that Sturridge put in as well. Balo is working on learning to fit into the system, people saying he is lazy are not watching the same games I am. He came from a system that ranged between slow and plodding for pace and is now in a system that WAS high octane. No shit he is taking time to adjust. I am disappointed that he has missed two sitters, but part of that is over-thinking because he is trying to figure out his role. As soon as he starts to settle and just play instead of thinking, he'll improve. But to be honest, he was never meant to have to start 8-10 games in a row as a lone striker and even last year, Rodgers system struggled when it was one striker up top. Coutinho, Sterling, Lallana, and Sturridge will play great together and start to rip teams apart IMO.  Balo was trying to get behind RM's defense and tried a couple through balls (and the cutback to Allen was nice as well). They didn't come off, but the attempts were there. 

Our defense is shambles...I don't...I got nothing there. Migs always sucked at crosses and set pieces, but his reflexes made up for it. This year he has gotten worse at saving shots. I have no confidence in him. Our back line lacks steel, Skrtel looks badass but is not going to go in hard. Lovern is constantly out of position. GJ is playing slightly better, but looks slow. Moreno is fantastic, but is young and makes mistakes with positioning as well. We need someone along the lines of (god I can't believe I am saying this) John Terry who will put a boot on someone's ass if they need it. We have no enforcer at any level on the team and we desperately need one to get in our opponents' head (a la Macherano). We miss someone who will elbow Torres in the face for leaving the team and going to a rival(a la Agger). We miss a player who has his teammates terrified that he will attack them if they slow down (a la Suarez). Gerrard is fantastic, but he is not that guy. And we need that guy.

- We were losing 3-0 to currently the greatest side in world football. Swapping shirts at half-time sends out the message ""sorry everyone, we've lost"" because it's something you do AFTER the match. That sort of attitude, whether intentional or not is completely out of order. It isn't fair to his teammates and it definitely isn't fair to the fans.

- He has come under criticism for his lack of effort anyway. By swapping shirts at half time he is asking for more criticism. No matter how trivial some fans believe it to be, it's common knowledge in England that it isn't acceptable (for the above reasons) and so he should have some respect and wait until the end of the match.

- For me, wearing the shirt should be a symbolic way of showing that you are fighting for your team. Willingly swapping that shirt at half-time just completely detracts from the competitive spirit of the game in my opinion. Those people in white were our enemies for another 45 minutes, and whilst I love to see a degree of respect in the game this goes beyond that and just screams ""we are a smaller team than you, and you have already won"".

- Coutinho and Sakho were disciplined for doing this last year against Chelsea, and rightfully so. The reason it has blown up is because it's yet another example of Balotelli looking as if he doesn't give a toss. Coutinho and Sakho (at the time) did not give off this attitude and so it was a non-story as it was just an example of carelessness rather than disrespect.

Balotelli has attracted the attention of the world through making outlandish statements about himself and being entertaining both on and off the pitch. He cannot expect to be treated kindly by the media if he is playing poorly and at the same time doing stupid things like this, that is sport. Maybe he should have thought more carefully before saying he was second only to Messi a couple of years back.

I desperately, sincerely want him to come good, because he does have the ability and in a strange way I do like the man for his irreverence and inability to comply.

Some of these girls would have been more than willing to throw themselves at the singer (or even the rest of us haha) and so we made damn sure that none of us was ever alone with them.

Which it should be, because unless they can prove otherwise they are in total control of their actions and understand the consequences. It only takes one person to say ""no"" for it not to happen (barring a 14 year old forcing themselves upon someone). 

There's literally no excuse for someone having sex with a minor, if they do it they are aware of the consequences.

&gt;However as the law is based on morality

No, I'm sorry but that's wrong. You can either say laws are based on morality, which is therefore objective, or people have different opinions of what constitutes morality, in which case it's subjective.

If laws are based on a subjective morality, then laws aren't ""based"" on anything other than the opinion of those who are in power at the time.

I believe it is the *purpose* of the law to reflect the values and morality of the *society* in which it operates. The vast majority of people in Britain think having sex with someone under the age of 16 is wrong, it doesn't matter if people disagree with that moral judgement because they are the minority. 

I don't care why someone makes the argument, it's wrong to try to sleep with people who are, scientifically, going through a time in their life where they think differently and experience a lot of changes. Especially when those people are in positions of respect, admiration or authority.

**Prediction**   9th

**#1. The Crisis at Fullback**

I think we have a wonderful squad, but where we struggle is at full back and unfortunately in this era of football that is an awful weakness to have. Angel Rangel is a club legend, but Im not convinced he's a top-half premier league player, Taylor is horribly inconsistent, Tiendelli is hardly a defensive rock and Jazz is still unexperienced. Moses made a fool of AR for Stoke, Obertan consistently beat Taylor and Tadic made Taylor look like a child. Unsurprisingly all 3 cases resulted in a goal. We NEED to get a fullback in the winter window and personally I'd throw in Jazz because his performance against McGeady was the best i've seen from one of our fullbacks this year.

**#2. The Second Half**

Not much to say here. We are a top 4 squad in the first half of every game and a relegation candidate in the last half. Is it focus or fitness? No idea, but it needs to be fixed. The only thing I look forward to every second half in Montero coming in and obliterating the opposition's fullbacks.

**#3. The Big Guys Up Front**

Siggy is sublime right now, Dyer should be an England international, Routledge is as good as ever and Montero is lightning in a bottle. However, our strikers are not finishing their chances well. Gomis was a champions league striker and Bony is bound for a top 4 team eventually. Both of them are wonderful in build play and their presence can't be understated, however they need to start banging them in. What happens if Siggy cools off his shit-hot form? Suddenly the team doesn't look so good.

**Quick Finishing Points**

-Our wingers make me feel tingly inside

-The emergence of Shelvey has been wonderful

-I get the feeling we are going to have a decent cup run if we beat L'Pool

-Centre-Backs are absolute animals. Amat was looking top quality as well

-Ki's potential is frightening. Dictated play against Chelsea for awhile even

-Fabianski is really good at everything other than stopping shots it seems

**Conclusion**

This is a team we can build on, but it isn't a Europa League team just yet. If we can hang on to key players and reinforce our flanks we might push for 7th next year. One of the most exciting Swansea sides i've ever seen and it'll be a fun season to watch.

While it is perfectly possible to have, for example, a 14 year old mature enough to make her own decisions about her body and it's perfectly possible to have a 17, 18 or even 30 year old who isn't, you can't write a law that says ""You can't have sex with people who can't make that decision"" because that's essentially unenforceable.

When you make laws there will always be outliers, exceptions, the one off cases that don't really fit the pattern. This is one of those times where the huge majority of children under the age of 16 are vulnerable to adult influence like this. For the small minority who feel this is unfair I feel for them, but that is part and parcel of living in civilised society.

If I can drive a car really fast at speed and under total control, should I be allowed to speed? If my wife is ""OK"" with me beating the shit out of her because my tea is cold, should I be allowed to do it?

Your argument is totally illogical, laws restrict individual agency and autonomy on an everyday basis and that's the actual foundation of civil society. You can't go and murder a shop keeper because he overcharged you, but that is denying you agency and autonomy. 


&gt;Even worse is that it is grossly hypocritical given that were it convenient for those wielding power and authority then these girls would be considered criminally responsible in other matters.

It depends on the matter. Children as young as 5 know the difference between ""right"" and ""wrong"" and by the age of 12 (the age where you are held criminally responsible) they should be fully aware of this and their actions for all ""serious"" crimes. Despite this, they are still able to be influenced by adults extremely easily. 

The entire factor you're missing here is the legal system already deals with these shades of grey. A 16 year old having sex with a 15 year old he is dating at his school in a totally consensual way is going to be punished far less than a 40 year old grooming a child. On the other hand a 14 year old committing assault will be dealt different than a 40 year old committing assault.

I don't know if you intend to but you come across as defending individuals who have sex with minors. There is a stack of research that demonstrates that children are easily groomed and taken advantage of at this period in their life. They get crushes on teachers and authority figures and celebrities and even though they are ""willing"" they don't understand why.

Here's a silly example that I'm using to apply something today to x years time (not trying to conflate anything here - just an analogy or something!!):

Take copyright infringement/file sharing for example - if you uploaded a bunch of movies and music now, what would the maximum penalty be? But you'd never receive that. Now imagine we fast-forward 40 years to a point where there's been a HUGE up-surge in outrage and public opinion has moved drastically against this offence. Now in 2055 you're seeing people getting huge penalties handed down. But what about the people who did it in 2014? Would it really be fair to back-tack and punish all of them with the 2055 mindset? After all, the people doing it in 2014 thought it ware barely even punishable at all - and those same people wouldn't dream of doing it in 2055!

So far Chelsea has been off to a great start but it has largely been business as usual.

It doesn't bother me that there is little mention of Chelsea, given that they are trying to talk about 10 different matches [and any tangential narratives] within in a very short time frame. I don't take it as anti-Chelsea bias, and even if it is, who cares.

Fry has said several things in the last few years that have really irked me. This is one of them, and [similarly his 'speech' at that dinner a couple of months ago](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/fry-criticises-operation-yewtree-in-dinner-party-rant-calling-for-tougher-laws-to-deter-false-sex-abuse-allegations-9602686.html).

In that regard I don't think he's seeing the bigger picture in all this, because he's too concerned about his friends (understandable, to an extent). It's problematic and regrettable that some people have been arrested wrongly and investigated, only for it all to be dropped - I'm sure everyone can agree that there will always be people wrongly accused. However, the number of people this happens to is completely and utterly dwarfed by the number of victims abused over the years and, I would say, the number of people abused that we will never ever find out about.      
In the grand scheme of things I would say that wrongful arrests are the lesser of two evils. 

Terry Gilliam took a similar line in regard to Paul Gambaccini on twitter the other week (and last year in an interview), calling Yewtree a ""[witch hunt](https://twitter.com/TerryGilliam/status/520879088417120256)"".

I get that these people are seeing some of their friends arrested (wrongly in their view) and then 'cleared' (for want of a better word), but I don't see why they then must damn the whole operation particularly given the many hundreds of people who have obviously been abused by a number of different people. *And* after there've been several convictions.

Of course I say all that as someone who hasn't been through the trauma of abuse, or through the horrible scenario of wrongful (or rightful) arrest. Would it happen to me I would *hope* (though of course I can't guarantee) that I can keep all that in mind.

As part of a campaign to ban a disfavoured class of people from being allowed to adopt children, yes.  How would you feel if a peer cited a similar survey asking ""would you like your children to be adopted by a black man and woman"" while calling for black people to be banned from adopting, or one asking ""would you like your children to be adopted by a Catholic man and woman"" while calling for Catholics to be banned from adopting?  The ability to found a family is a fundamental human right - the government shouldn't even consider removing it from people purely because they are disliked.

&gt; Is it bigoted to want people to have the right to opt out of something they disagree with? She's hardly trying to force her own personal view into law.

She was opposed to extending anti-discrimination laws to cover sexual orientation in principle.  It's very, very common for MPs and peers to try and water down bills they would still oppose in watered down form.  O'Cathain has loudly and consistently opposed every advance in LGBT rights for decades, including the repeal of Section 28 and the equalisation of the age of consent.  For some reason you seem to have cherrypicked the least terrible of her contributions on this subject.

Having said that, I don't know what amendment you are talking about, but no, people should not be able to opt out of anti-discrimination laws just because they disagree with them.  They have extremely broad (overbroad in my view) exceptions for religious organizations, priests, chaplains, and private clubs, among other things - that's far more than enough.  If you don't want to be involved in marriages or adoptions you disapprove of, then you shouldn't work at a registry office, wedding venue, or adoption agency.

&gt; It's quite possible to be against gay marriage and similar without being bigoted.

I really can't wait for straight people to get fed up of this ridiculous mantra.  If putting vast amounts of effort into preventing LGBT people from being able to exercise rights that everybody else takes for granted is not an example of anti-LGBT bigotry, then nothing is.

Good is always going to be subjective. You say you don't really like the fact that the show has gotten smaller and has no real sense of a greater arc, but there are many other people who love this series for just that reason and didn't like how arc heavy Matt Smith's era was. There are people who hated Clara with Matt Smith and now love her with Capaldi.

And isn't always clear who the Doctor is right away. It took a while for Eccleston's Ninth Doctor to show his true colors and then from Classic Who there is the First Doctor who started out cold, rude, and devious but became more warm, caring and concerned for his companions. The Seventh Doctor began as a slightly comical oaf that slowly gave way to a more cold manipulator.

In fact Capaldi's Twelfth Doctor is more like what they envisioned for C. Baker's Sixth Doctor. A darker and more cold Doctor that would slowly soften and reveal himself to actually be one of the most warm and caring Doctors. In fact this is exactly what happens for Six in the audios.

Personally I like what they have been doing lately. The Doctor has shown a disdain for soldiers in the past including the Brigadier who he would have left at first if he had had the chance. They became friends because the Doctor got to know what he was like despite uniform. His love for the Brigadier also makes his hate of soldiers make even more sense because he hates what being a soldier makes people do (the Brigadier blew up defenseless Silurians effectively committing genocide). The Doctor almost didn't forgive him and had he had the chance to leave right then and there he probably would have. And don't forget that before his regeneration, the Doctor fought as a soldier on Trenzalore against enemy soldiers for 900 years. It would be enough to make anyone sick and tired of soldiers.

I love where they are taking Clara. I personally don't think anything has been cringeworthy. She is having a hard time adjusting because despite the time stream stuff Eleven was HER Doctor. She watched her best friend essentially die replaced with someone she doesn't understand. And she probably feels like if she doesn't know Twelve, she probably never really knew the Doctor. She wants to be with Danny but she still cares for the Doctor and is addicted to the life of a time-traveller and monster-fighter.

**tl:dr I say just give it time. Sometimes all it takes is a little perspective. You may find yourself liking it more after some time passes and you revisit the episodes and you may not. You don't have to like all of Doctor Who to like Doctor Who or to be considered a fan. The show itself goes through its own series of regenerations and you shouldn't feel like you have to like every series. We all have our different opinions, tastes, experiences, and perspectives. We will all like different versions of the show and different incarnations of the Doctors and his companions.**

Also as a side-note there is a world of Doctor Who out there besides the show.

false,CaptBaha,null,null,"I might be a bit late - but retelling some of my experiences is spiritually cathartic as the man who enabled the majority of it (if not all), as well as coloured the Saints experience, lies two bedrooms away, afflicted by cancer, virtually ~~house~~bed-ridden and mere shell of the charismatic colossus he was all those years ago.  ""Sinned"", he would call himself, his name he cleverly (at least he thought so) reversed, to the unfortunate lady (usually a waitress) who caught his eye... ""but always a Saint"". I love you Dad!

My father was an ardent Saints supporter who designated it his sole purpose in life was to ensure his children carried on his legacy.  So much so he named his daughter (of his second marriage) - my sister - after the tiny fortress at Milton Road, **Dell**. Myself, he used to joke to anyone in earshot, came close to being called Fratten Park, if only out of respect that his family came from the Isle of Wight, a tiny island equidistant from the coast of both Portsmouth and Southampton. But he exercised restrain, because in reverse it read ""*Crap not 'arf*"". The audience would roll eyeballs in unison.

The rest of us (Mum, Sis and I) were born in Singapore, and would make the annual pilgrimage to the Dell (and the early years of St Mary's) every extended school break to catch whichever match there was available at home. It was always a grand affair and he made it a point to incorporate train-spotting tours at Eastleigh and other yards - things that fascinated every proper English boy born in the late 1940s. It was always the opportune moment for him to sit me down and preach with gravitas ""Shovelling coal would put hairs on your chest"".

The first conscious memory I had of watching the Saints live was a 2-0 win at home against Aston Villa with Beattie scoring both, and then throwing away a lead against West Ham the following week.  My Dad, who worked in a Norwegian multi-national shipping company, knew the goal-scoring wonder that was Claus Lundekvam through colleagues in Bergen, always managed to shamelessly procure access to the players lounge where he would strike up the most inept tactical discussion with the disinterested Claus.  My sister would set off on a manhunt for Jo Tessem and I would resign to the corner of the room, hopelessly awkward and trying to drum up the courage to get Le God and Wayne Bridge to sign my Mickey Mouse autograph book.

2 years later, after Chris Marsden throws himself into the post to poke home a goal on the far end of the stadium to salvage a draw after we go 1-0 down to Newcastle at home, I find myself once again slinking around the cheese sandwich platter in the players lounge trying to decipher what Gordon Strachan was saying to several reporters.  A young boy waddles up and starts gushing about the bald elegance that is Marsden, and in my world-weary cynicism as a 12 year old, fired back immediately - ""well aside from the goal, he's a bit shite, isn't he?"".  The goal-scoring hero, and one of the contenders for man-of-the-match (claims my clueless father), enters from stage right as if cued, and collects his son, who's stunned into silence and on the verge of tears.  I don't recall ever getting lounge access passes since.  The steady decline of health and subsequent death of my grandmother coincided with Southampton's relegation and sale of the holiday home, and the annual highlight become a distant (and under-appreciated) memory.

Favourite player: Antti Niemi. The Finnish stopper was world-class, and possibly the best keeper in the league in his prime.  Knobbly-kneed Michael Svensson was a close second.  Always looked to have a level of composure and leadership that compensated for and elevated his partner-in-crime Claus. The Beattie-Pahars combination was also a deadly striking partnership that could score against any team in the league (Beattie. Chelsea. Middle of nowhere. That goal...).

The house is riddled with mouldy Southampton memorabilia, in no small part due to the collective lack of creativity for Father's Day and birthday presents and my father's fascination with collecting match-day programmes.

Besides the sado-masochistic fraternity that masquerades as the local Southampton supporters society, nobody else has ever heard of the Saints up until recently, beyond ""the club that Walcott came from"" and ""sounds like that club Arsenal beat in the FA Cup"".  Let alone anybody can pronounce the bloody name properly.  Speaking of which, they once petitioned my father back in 02-03 to give them a guided tour of the premises.  They also somehow got wind of my father's 'clout' with the players and insisted on introducing all four of them to the players in an expedition to the holy land. Even his indestructible ego was certain that to do so would stretch the limits of Lundekvam (who looked increasingly like an inmate on death-row as it so happened). In hindsight it was possibly my father's delusion that only he and his family were entitled to the perks because of his presence was a blessing upon the usually sombre post-match autopsy. Not that it mattered - the enthusiasm of the Supporters club died immediately when he suggested that they join him for some steam-locomotive appreciation.

On the one hand you can suggest that you find this out by asking people via opinion polls, focus groups, and referendums. That's a reasonable way to establish publicly held morals but not necessary.

If they were necessary you could look back at any democratic country and prove that the laws of the time didn't reflect popular opinion, morals, and values. This generally isn't the case though, with some things becoming illegal as time goes on (e.g. the legality of beating your wife) whereas others become legal (e.g. gay marriage). 

So therefore there must be some element that informs politicians of what ""society"" believes. Generally this could be argued that it's the fact they grew up in ""society"" which instilled those values.

The problem with Fry's premise isn't that over times attitudes change, but the fact the attitude hasn't really changed. Marrying a 14 year old back in the middle ages, especially for royalty, was seen as fine. We can look back now and say it was wrong (it was by our modern standards, which I believe are superior) but at the time you can see why it was allowed.

However, society did not approve of sex with under-age children in the 70s, it's just becoming clear that a lot of people turned a blind eye to it. These things are very different. If the actions of Jimmy Saville had become public at the time, popular opinion would have torn him to pieces, and he would have spent a long time in jail. The problem was back then people had a lot more deference to authority (baby boomers generally do). This means accusing a celebrity of something like that is an awkward inner struggle.

These days there isn't that deference to authority or the worry that you will somehow be punished for ratting out a celebrity, partly due to improved communication. Therefore people can go with their conscious a lot more and are more likely to report these things.

Ultimately I like Stephen Fry, but here he's just wrong. I don't think he should be retroactively charged for drug abuse in the palace or anything else he's admitted to. At the same time though I disagree that we should be going easy on rock stars willingly shagging 14 year olds who don't know any better.",0,1414086543,null,0,false,0,clhpoto,t3_2k2ulj,t1_clhpoto,t1_clhp9ga,null,1426386211,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Even if you're saying the view has changed, the fact is the underlying reasoning (that they're insufficiently independent, overly trusting of/used to following adult guidance, unable to understand the aftermath of a sexual encounter in advance and not emotionally experienced or stable enough to deal with it healthily) applies regardless of what year it is. 

These girls may have been proud to shag a some famous rock star at 14, but that's the whole point. They did something they'd not have done with anyone else at that age because of the position and status of these people and their mistaken belief that pride can derive from who you've had in your body. That doesn't make them any more prepared to deal with how they feel about themselves for it at 18 or 27, or how it changed their developmental attitudes to sex and self respect.

Then on the right wing pannad Baines and accelerated easily past Distain, but the cross was again too deep. After that he beat Distain again 1v1 and put in a dangerous low cross that was cut out.

He created one chance breaking from the middle also. 

He himself didn't have any efforts on goal, I think. His playing style reminds me a bit of Welbeck and Sturridge combined with added trickery. His burst of pace combined with strength is very impressive.

false,Kitchner,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt; As beliefs they cannot be superior they are simply changing opinions.

While you are right that they are essentially changing opinions, it's wrong that they cannot be superior.

For example, I hope you join me in disapproving of adults having sex with children. It's a fairly common opinion in the west (though apparently some people on Reddit take offence to that suggestion).

Why do we believe this? Well a whole host of reasons to do with understanding the child's mental and physical development and well-being. In some parts of the world though, people will think this is OK, possibly because they don't know, understand, or care about the reasons we have.

So why, in that case, do you believe in what I believe and not what they believe? It's because you think this stance is superior in the way that you believe it is ""right"". Hopefully you don't go around believing in things willy nilly unless you believe it is the ""right"" opinion to have.

In 100 years time opinions on things we see as taboo or normal today may be totally different, and they may look back with scorn at our morals and value. That's fine, and that will be their opinion, but they will also believe their morals and values are superior.

I used to be one of those people who says we should understand other cultures and respect morals and values different to our own. I still do believe that, but now I also draw a line. When it comes to certain issues such as incest, rape, child exploitation, I'm not prepared to be understanding or compromising. Maybe one day society will take the same attitude towards one of my beliefs, but that's just how things are.

Yeah, I expect I'm going to see a minimum age of 58 at the earliest, I'd not be surprised if it goes up again before 2045ish (digression, all these dates sound very 1990s tv show futuristic).

&gt; So if you decided that in you first year of retirement you need £30,000 net of basic rate tax then you would crystallise £35,294.11

This is really useful to know, thanks. So lets say I have a total of £2M (just want to sketch this out to check something).

The lifetime limit when I retire is £1.5M, and I take out £50k a year and see no growth. 

If the lifetime limit didn't change, I'd not pay any extra tax until year 30 when I finally cross the lifetime limit when I'd start paying the extra tax on everything I withdraw.

If the lifetime limit *does* change and goes up slowly to £2.5M, I never actually cross the line.

Of course, there's the risk that it goes down / rules change / whatever political thing happens.

Does that make sense? 

&gt; That said monies can be ""parked"" in ISA to nearer retirement age and then as long as earnings allow placed into pension have benefited from tax free growth.

Yeah I think this might be a better plan, it'll take a bit of planning later on but moving it from ISA -&gt; SIPP is something I can do, SIPP -&gt; ISA is not.

false,orwellsocietyguy,null,null,"&gt; They can either learn from our cultural and political history and avoid those mistakes, or they can carry on with honour killings/ repressing women/ etc. because (according to you) we have no right to criticise based on the history of an empire that hasn't existed for at least sixty years that virtually none of us participated in.

So you're saying that Britain feels the same way that Germany does about the second world war? The Germans have learned from their past mistakes and there is a generation of people WELL aware of what they did - just go talk to young German people - they are actively ashamed. I don't feel as though we are - people still feel ""Britain Ruled The Waves"" and ""when we left we'd given them railroads and politics"". 

&gt;Because we've already been there, done that - giving us (and everyone else) hindsight that some other countries simply don't have 

We waged an illegal war in Iraq and most people under the age of 30 have no idea about the atrocities we caused in India. The majority of people seem to think we turned up and improved the place no end and left with a handshake. When our atrocities are highlighted in the press they are labelled unpatriotic. Our past behaviour is almost unheard of in British culture. Compare that to World War 2.

&gt; do we celebrate gay marriage as progress, or do we not encourage others to follow our example because it only happened recently and we should still be feeling guilty?

That's easy to say coming from the position of the slave master in his castle. Yes we are progressive and we should hold others to our standards, but you seem to think that places like Pakistan, where barbaric behaviour exists is entirely due to religious thinking. The country was torn apart, culture was ransacked, history erased, generational institutions crushed, a guaranteed war-like situation instilled and finally entire generations and populations were scattered across borders we randomly drew up and enforced. Tens of thousands of miles of borders we drew up in Asia and the middle east are racked with war.

&gt; we have no right to criticise based on the history of an empire that hasn't existed for at least sixty years 

The philosophies we hold dear here are easy to uphold when you have a generation of kids who only have to worry about university fees and the latest iPhone update. They're not so easy to uphold when your country has been ripped to sheds for thousands of years and a drone has blasted your 6 year old brother to pieces along with hundreds of other children because terrorism. The UK is an ally of the US who continues to carry out these activities with our blessing. You want to tell someone they have to uphold gay rights - then do that whilst you're protesting the companies in the UK that sell 12.3Billion in arms to the rest of the world.

&gt; No, you keep using key facts out of context

History follows us through generations. Our generation is not demanding the end to drone strikes, to apologise to Burma or Spain or making amends for it's past behaviour. It's got a public that's screaming about ""immigration ruining the country"" and voting in UKIP and a younger generation oblivious to our past. Were sitting, wrapped in cotton wool and demanding that everyone else around the world to just somehow realise that we're ""oh so perfect now"" and follow our lead. And when they don't blame religion.

South Africa signed up for defence contracts costing $5bn; at the same time, President Thabo Mbeki said that the country couldn’t afford to extend antiretroviral medication to five million HIV-infected citizens.

Another issue that really is quite key to this that people don't like talking about is that from the start of puberty kids will be having sexual feelings and feeling (at least some of them) that they would like to act on them. Whether those thoughts are right, wrong, or misguided remains a contentious issue but the fact is they exist and denying that reality only further complicates issues by implicating adults as the sole 'corruptors' of 'childlike innocence' which is largely an illusion that adults like to maintain.

If you're on a two lane motorway, you can filter between the two lanes, but avoid riding on the lines, as the catseyes aren't exactly grippy. The biggest thing to watch when filtering to the front is not going over the line too much, as this is actually a fineable offence. The acceleration of your bike will allow you to clear the cars in a fraction of a second anyway, so don't worry about it. As long as you're being safe about it and Constable Lawman isn't on his period you'll be fine. If you pay much attention to YouTube riders, watch Baron Von Grumble and Royal Jordanian - most of their filtering is safe although quite intense. The number one piece of advice I can give you is if you are filtering to the front and think ""I don't want to be in that position ahead"" just stop and cut back into the lane.

Obviously this means less pressing from the midfielders and somewhat slow game. But playing a diamond with effective runners and 2 strikers with good mobility, that can be a very good team.

It's classic re-enforcement. We see that immigrants / foreign nationals / members of other cultures get a soft touch and it's very unsurprising that that cultures resentment. Why should any of the examples above result in a 'kinder' sentence based on the ethnicity or culture or religion of those involved. 

This country operates on the principle that ignorance of the law does not excuse one of it. If they weren't sure if it was appropriate to get drunk and beat someone up, or to have sex with a minor, they should have investigated before doing it (If that's the *real* reason...) 

The law should be fair across the board. Not kinder to foreigners *or* British nationals because of any kind of ignorance or exception. 

Everyone who has gotten drunk will have gotten drunk for a first time - that doesn't excuse a racist attack.

&gt; Frequently Asked Questions

&gt;Some kids aren't sure that getting a pocket money advance loan is the best thing for them, here we try to answer any questions you might have.

&gt;Q. What does APR mean?

&gt;It stands for Annual Percentage Rate and it's really confusing and boring.

&gt;Q. Shouldn't I wait until I've saved up enough money to buy the things I want?

&gt;But waiting for things takes ages!

&gt;Q. I'm worried that getting my pocket money early will put me in debt and I won't be able to pay it back.

&gt;What are you, a scaredy cat? Are you scared of ghosts too?! Chicken!

&gt;Q. How much can I borrow?

&gt;We will look at how much your pocket money is before deciding on how much to offer you as a loan. Usually we will loan you just a little bit more than you can afford to repay.

&gt; Q. How do I get the free toy?

&gt; Simply run up a late-payment rollover charge of £400 or more an we'll send you your very own Mr. Repayment coin toy!",0,1414094179,null,0,false,0,clhty3m,t3_2k4jzb,t1_clhty3m,t3_2k4jzb,null,1426384153,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

false,grollcool,null,null,"Parking the bus *is* a negative style though. Do not confuse parking the bus with counter attacking, which is a legitimate tactic.

Parking the bus is just planting your defense in front of your goal and trying to cling to a clean sheet and only attacking as a ""bonus"" or as an after-thought, and not making scoring your highest priotiy.

Any tactic where scoring and winning is not the highest priority is a *negative* tactic, and is always looked down upon.

Now playing counter attacking football is different. Counter attacking football, like all positive tactics, has its biggest priority as scoring a goal. And you can do so without having to plant your entire team in your own half. The best counter attacking team for the last 5 years has been Real Madrid. Yet Real Madrid almost *never* have less than the majority possession. How is this possible? Possession is not connected to a counter-attacking style, you don't have to purposefully forgo your own possession to play on the counter attack like you do when you park the bus.

Real Madrid would always dominate possession, so when did the counter attack come in? When they lost it and the other team had the ball in their half. Naturally in football you will lose the ball, regardless of who you are or how you play. The difference in a counter attacking style however is that you take advantage of winning the ball back by immediately attacking the other team.

So parking the bus =/= counter attack. Parking the bus is a terrible tactic based off of inferiority. Counter attack is a legitimate tactic with the highest priority of scoring, like all legitimate tactics must have. At best you should hope we play in a style with a lethal counter attack, you should *never* however hope that we park the bus, unless we are against opposition where we are way out of our depths, but that should never be an excuse with this Chelsea side that is among the best in the world.",0,1414094735,null,0,1414094924,0,clhu9m1,t3_2k2efy,t1_clhu9m1,t1_clhlz8x,null,1426384004,0,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,0

But he is average on the wing - he works hard but his technique lets him down. If we want to get the most out of Sturridge, we should play him as far up front as possible.

So Sturridge is the one occupying two CB's and Balotelli attracts a midfielder or a fullback which gives more space for Sterling. At the moment he doesn't get much free space from good teams.

First off, and in the nicest way possible, you've been a bit of a numpty for letting the payment roll through and falling foul of this, but you're 19 and I'm sure most of us did some daft/forgetful/heat of the moment student-stress things at your age. In future, make sure you read carefully what you're signing up to and **don't do it** if you're unsure. I don't mean every single line of the T&amp;Cs, but certainly the pertinent points about your right to cancel, when you can do so, what payment will/won't be taken and so on. You may be forced to pay up all or some of what they claim you owe, but perhaps the below will give you some more reading/research to consider. 

The important thing now is to take a breath and deal with it. The MSE site/Consumer Action Group guys know their stuff inside out, despite it being 'just' a consumer site, and I have followed their advice on more than one occasion, though not had dealings with this company you're having trouble with. 

I'm afraid you'll need to form your own opinions because none of us are telling you what to do one way or another. I'm afraid you've got yourself into this so you'll have to get yourself out. However a quick glance at the sites above shows a number of people essentially treating letters and threats from this company in same way as the scammers who try to charge individuals for flouting parking 'contracts' on 'private' land - by ignoring it or politely writing back to state that they didn't agree to a contract. From searching MSE for 'Legalcare' and checking out comments it would appear there have been varying levels of success with this tactic so make of that what you will. I am not advocating it as a course of action. I noticed that others who've run into this crew have commented that the website layout is often changed, meaning key pieces of information have been difficult to find. 


However, I would advocate speaking to your uni welfare guys as a **priority** - you must have a dept in the university you're at who can assist with student finance/legal/consumer issues? Show them ALL correspondence and check with them their understanding of exactly what the letters you have received state. What Debt Collection place is contacting you? Is it Daniel Silverman or somewhere else? Again, check out comments online about what others have experienced and form your own opinions. 

If it was me, personally, I'd be really interested to know what legal detriment this company have suffered as a result of you cancelling the subscription. Again, this is only from a quick trawl of the sites above, but others who've not paid or have cancelled have immediately had access to the company's site blocked, so quite what loss the company would claim to have suffered in law would be interesting to know, if they have provided no service.

1.  Switch to zonal marking on set pieces.  Whatever we are doing (can't really call it man marking with all the free runners) is clearly not working

2. Stop trying to make the lone striker happen.  Stick to 2 up front.

3. Keep Sturridge healthy.  This alone would make a pretty big difference, I think.

I would also add a few more speculative suggestions:

1. Use Glen Johnson . . . sparingly
2. Think about hiring a new defensive coach
3. Employ an actual Defensive Mid to do DM things.

Always be alert. You need to know exactly what's going on in front of you, keep any eye out for any movement (pedestrians, cars changing lanes, cyclists, other motorbikes) as that's where the main danger lies. Remember your blind spot checks. Watch out for junctions.

It's best to err on the slow side, especially when passing larger vehicles. You should also keep an eye out for places where you can safely merge back in if the situation changes.

Law-wise, it's okay to cross the lane marker (dashed white), but you must not pass a ""no overtaking"" line (double white, solid). You must not go past the solid white line at a traffic light either (unless it's green). Do not go in cycle lanes, and do not go the wrong side of traffic islands with a keep left (blue arrow, pointing left and down) on them.

That group has shrunk considerably in the last two months.

A big part of is it Capaldi's Doctor. Me and my girlfriend had started with Eccleston so we were used to something a bit colder, but for those who loved Tennant and Smith, the switch over to not only a cold Doctor but one who is unnecessarily an asshole 24/7, really seems to be the killer for them.

It doesn't help that Clara was never much liked. I'm not sure ""why"" but the majority of us just never appreciated her as a companion. I'm starting to like her now with the ""addiction"" angle but it's too little too late seeing as her run is coming to an end.

And then there's the episodes. It's masked by the freshness of Capaldi but the episodes are **bad**. There has been no improvement in the writing quality since the lows of Series 7, and the new direction of the show is very ""small"" and actiony. Moffatt's run and his episodes before he became showrunner we're known for their big ideas and the sort of magic he brought. We seem to have lost that touch.

Leaves you with £96 per month spare.

To do:

1.  Call your phone company.  Tell them you can't afford your monthly bill.  They will drop it down.   At the end of your contract switch to a SIM only plan with somebody like Gif Gaf.

2.  **DO NOT GET A NEW VEHICLE**  You will be digging yourself deeper in debt.  Even if the monthly payments are lower you'll just be paying out for longer on another car.

3. Option a)  If the car is parked off the main road i.e. on a drive way or residents car park.  Declare it SORN and cancel the insurance.  You'll save yourself £142 per month immediately

Option b) Go to http://www.easycar.com They are currently looking for people willing to hire out their cars.  This means you can hire out your car and try to of set some or all of your car payment costs.

Option c) assuming you are more than half way through your payment plan on the car you can request the voluntary termination as others have stated.  This is your best option currently to provide an immediate breather to your finances.

4.  You haven't listed the amount of debt you have on each credit card (you've just said it's £2100 across the three).  Any spare cash you have should be spent on whichever card has the highest interest rate until it is cleared.

5. As you live with your mum can you hand the baby to her to look after in the evenings whilst you get some part time evening work?  I know it's heart breaking to leave your baby behind but you need to clear as much debt as possible in order to give yourself more breathing room.

6.  As your are not employed currently you should not be paying any student debt. You should call the student loan company and query this.

I can't find the articles for some reason now (not that i tried too hard), but even back when he was in Lille, he wasn't known as the hardest trainer, and he himself joked about it at times. After the Hazard ""Decision"" (Lebron reference) went public, Chelsea communities online discussed this aspect of him quite a bit in anticipation of him perhaps joining the squad, and even after he arrived to London, the trainers actually said they're not ultra impressed with his intensity during training, but quipped that he'll likely perform differently in a real game. 

http://www.espnfc.com/player/101390/eden-hazard

Heck, the espn player profile mentions this, ""Hazard's start to the 2010-11 campaign was troubled as he was publicly criticised by Belgium national team coach Georges Leekens, who accused him of being lazy in training, and he was also dropped by Lille coach Rudi Garcia. He didn't start a league game for Lille until November but ultimately re-established himself as an integral member of the first-team."" 

Either way, I'm not saying he was or is lazy or anything close to it. I doubt you can be a professional football athlete at all if you weren't hardworking.

That doesn't answer anything about set pieces where he says we simply need to be more aggressive. This is laughable, we've had the same issue for over 2 years now, just being more aggressive isn't the magical solution.

He then points to the lack of coaching time as being a big part of why we are struggling to bed in the new players, which is fair enough, but again with regards to our defence - we had plenty of coaching time last season and we were rubbish defensively.

But

VDB didn't even need him. He has a bad record with spain, while Paco Alcácer had been 100% fit, as well as in red hot form. He called him up, and played him in every game, just because José advised him not to. He played him in every game, even though Paco had been scoring and playing much better. 

This is the thing with national sides. If Roy could, he would have done the same thing with Sturridge. It's not about the team, it's a battle of ego's. Like they're saying 'don't tell me what to do'. 

He's playing with Diego's future as a player, and as a functional human. Imagine he gets a career ending injury? Spain will just call up Paco instead. Chelsea would be down £32M, and more considering the fact that he's worth more than that. Not to mention the wages. Costa will be struggling with whatever injury he was punished with and the troubles of finding form if he does recover.

If Costa says he is too tired to play for spain, people will say he doesn't really love his country, just like they already do with Sterling and England.

I say Spain should call up Paco/Villa/ and maybe some other striker for his first. But VDB is stubborn with his choices. I remember Soldado scored a hat trick with spain ahead of the Euro and was still not called up because VDB preferred his horrible Torres/Villa/Negredo combo.

So she then decides to give up and just leave the store. Don't worry, she didn't steal anything (that I was aware of) - quite the opposite. She put the basket on the side of the counter that wasn't used, emptied the basket item by item onto the counter top, then puts the basket on the floor and walks out.

Some councils now have a directly-elected Mayor, like a city President.

The complicated bit is that you can have three separate levels of local government in some places, or just one or two. A county council deals with things like schools and libraries. Below that, a district council empties the bins and deals with things like housing, planning applications, and environmental health. Finally, a parish or town council mostly makes sure that the village green gets mowed and builds bus shelters. Many cities have one council taking on all those roles, and some areas have just a county and district council. Some  areas have no county council but a number of district councils work together to deliver those services. If all that makes sense, you weren't paying attention.

Councils don't exactly deal with breaches of the law (that would be a magistrates court for minor cases) but they'll take action over things like breaches of planning consent or noise complaints.

Yes they are. That an adult slept with them out of ignorance doesn't change the fact that adult had a responsibility that should have stopped them doing that if they'd know because no matter what the girl thinks at the time we don't know how they will feel about it when they are older. That they might be fine doesn't change the fact that what happened shouldn't have. 

&gt;Some of these girls may be sweet virgins swept up in the hormonal tidal wave, but the vast majority are going to be already sexually active.

If the girl is sexualy active or not have nothing to do with this. In large parts it's a healthy part of growing up for them to explore and experiment with sex at a younger age if they want to but it's important to note that this will largely happen with peers of similar ages not with adults who hold a position of responsibility or power. It's really very sad that young people can't have healthy normal experiences with out that being held against them when it comes to this. 

&gt; It's just more of an 'accomplishment' to sleep with a guy in a band, something to put you above other girls. Which, might be sad, but they know what they're doing.

And? Kids do stupid shit all the time, they all think they know their own minds and exactly what they want and some of them even will but as an adult it's impossible to know that and as such you have a responsibility to treat those young people accordingly. 

Like I said in my other post in my band we made sure we were never alone with underage girls exactly because they could be very insistent about what they wanted but that change nothing, whatsoever, about how deeply wrong it would have been for us to let them. 

&gt;We're all very precious about the idea of sex, but at the end of the day - it's just sex. You might change your mind afterwards, or not enjoy it the way you thought you would but it shouldn't affect your life. Being forced into it is a lot, lot different.

Again like I said sex or sexual activity at the age is healthy and natural part of development the issue is when you introduce adults, especially those who  hold positions of power or influence into that. The very nature of that relationship means it's all but impossible to have an honest sexual relationship and the result is that even what might seem like it isn't abuse can *be* abusive and you really might not be able to tell at the time. As the adult this leaves you with the responsibility to that underage person to do what it's in their best interests.",0,1414105327,null,0,false,0,clhzvg6,t3_2k2ulj,t1_clhzvg6,t1_clhpvjj,null,1426381388,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Realistically the parties have the same attitude to this topic as they did the MPs Expenses Scandal. I.e. parties are forced to confront it by the media and by the other parties trying to score small partisan points, but in the end it's not in the interests of any to push it too far. 'here and no further' is the doctrine of government investigations. As Yes Minister put it, 'trains are free to do where they want, but 'you' lay down the tracks.'

And really why is him telling a lady to stop taking pictures of his car even a problem?  He got ""threateningly close""? Wtf is that even supposed to mean?  Balo is a big guy and I'm sure anyone would feel threatened if he caught you taking pictures of his car and told you to stop when you didn't expect to see him there.  This just appears to be more blind scapegoating and it disgusts me considering how poor THE WHOLE TEAM has been.  Rodgers of all people should not be calling out Balotelli publicly when the entire team isn't looking good.  It's a sad state of affairs when there are only a handful of players on the team that are putting in consistently decent performances but that is no excuse to try to call out a single individual when it is the majority of the team playing poorly.  I am not trying to say Balo has been good so far but he has been no worse than Lovren or certain other players.  I don't think anyone at all should be too surprised Balotelli hasn't made an immediate impact when he has always played best with another striker and we have bairly seen him paired with another striker.  We also all knew as soon as he signed that his playstyle would not be an instant fit to the team and it would take him time to get used to it.  It has been 2 months.  That's it.  What we have seen of Balotelli is him playing amidst a team that is collectively playing poor and it is mind blowing that Rodgers would say something like this to me.
