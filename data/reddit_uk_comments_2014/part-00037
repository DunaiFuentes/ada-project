maintenance of equipment so that it can safely be used - their squat rack was missing a bolt that held the thing together for several weeks.

maintenance of facilities so that large parts of the gym are not unsafe/unavailable for use - a large and recurring water leak shut down about 1/4 of the free weight area, warped the floor pads and floor, creating both slippery spots and tripping hazards.  This took well over two months to fix fully.

Management did not care about either complaint, despite their high membership fees which, as far as i could tell, went exclusively to putting a new sauna in (it was, to be fair, a pretty sweet sauna).

So, it is your opinion that any time anyone is found not guilty of something, they are actually guilty?

The guys invited are all extremely experienced pros. There's a constant scan for an appropriate storm and then a 48 hour window to get to the location, anywhere in the world.

Points are scored on how radical a jump or move is more than how clean it is. Expect huge air time.

Personally I've never sailed more than 35 knots, which is quite a rush and actually fine if you've got the correct gear. I can't imagine 55+ though. Wind speed and its force do not correspond. 50 knots &lt;&gt; 25 knots * 2.

The absolute worst that can happen if you've just not paid what you owe is that your credit record goes to shit before of CCJs and you struggle to obtain credit in the future, you won't end up in prison or the stocks. Bankruptcy might be an option isn't as simple as it seems, it doesn't just wipe out your debts and then you start over, you still owe the money and you're required to pay those debts if you can afford to post bankruptcy, that said it can be a good option if you're really in too deep -- although if it's just an overdraft and some other consumer credit, I very much doubt you'll need bankruptcy.

As others have said, you should get in touch with StepChange, they are a fantastic charity who will look at how they can help you, either through repayment plans, bankruptcy, perhaps an IVA. The most important thing to remember is that it's very difficult to run away from debt, so by facing the issue head on you're going to save yourself even more hassle down the line.

I've not made up my mind on Gold and Sullivan yet, personally.  I am, however, willing to consider the possibility that the actions they've taken recently -- defending Sam openly, for instance -- have been made with the input of information they are not authorized to share, or that cannot be adequately explained in an open letter to the fans.

&gt;So, it is your opinion that any time anyone is found not guilty of something, they are actually guilty?

My position is that the court's interests and my interests aren't the same thing. The justice system in the UK deliberately lets criminals walk free to prevent innocent people from being jailed. My well being on the other hand is based on being around people I think are safe.

Are you saying that you trust the judgement of a system that intentionally lets dangerous people walk free over your own? are you conflating ""not guilty"" and ""innocent""?

The Wilson Street Police Box is actually functional. Behind the red panel is a working emergency services telephone. Below that is a St John's Ambulance first aid store, you can see the silver panel on the lower left. I'm not sure, but I think this might be the case for the Cathedral Street one too.

For a time, the Buchanan Street police box was actually bigger on the inside; an art project installed a series of mirrors and objects inside which gave the illusion of the inside going off into the distance. You could view it by opening the telephone panel and peering in. I think this was some time in the 90s, possibly during its polkadot phase, of which [this](http://www.kent-police-museum.co.uk/images/police_box_005.jpg) is the only picture I can find.

true,jjones217,num23,,"&gt;I realized we haven't really had one good win or fun game all season long

I agree with you, but with one major exception.

I don't care how down of a season their having, but beating United at Old Trafford and taking 4 points on the season - for the second year in a row, no less - absolutely qualifies as a good win.

Also:

&gt;all the best wins over the past years have come toward the end of the season, not in the middle

While this *is* true to an extent, it's hard not to remember that all of our Champions League fight collapses have come at this point in the season as well.

I will say, though, that I honestly feel much more upbeat about our chances moving forward. We don't have to play any of the Manchester clubs down the stretch, and have relatively favorable matches against top level clubs to close the season:

* **We play well vs Everton at home. Haven't lost since 2008.**

* Newcastle is always tough and we tend to struggle there.

* **We've played well at Stamford Bridge lately, drawing in the past two seasons (with legitimate threats at winning near the end)**

* **We're undefeated in our last 5 home premier league matches against Arsenal - with 3 wins and 2 draws.**

* **Spurs have won all three matches against Southampton in the new decade - 2 away and 1 home**

* Spurs are 1-1-1 in the last three trips to Liverpool, but on the bright side, Suarez seems to be cooling off a bit, as does his strike partner.

* **Spurs have won the last three home fixtures against Aston Villa, and have only lost once to them at WHL since 2003.**

* Spurs WILL have a rough run, facing Chelsea, Arsenal, Southampton, and Liverpool all in a row, but the middle two are at WHL

* **7 of Spurs final 11 matches are against bottom-10 teams and 4 of those are at home.

All in all, there is something to be said towards having some optimism down the stretch. Sure we could falter here and there, but if we can come out of that four game stretch with roughly 6 points, I think we'll be in good shape.",0,1391742904,null,0,false,0,cf93ksl,t3_1x7yn7,t1_cf93ksl,t1_cf927yq,null,1432289540,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

To answer why I would insist on it, I would first say that it is a photographer's right to be credited wherever their work is published. This changes when you start licencing your work or when the photographer decides. Nobody should decide for them. 

Secondly, there could be an EU law called the [Orphan works directive] (http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/orphan_works/index_en.htm). A piece of work (film/photo etc) becomes orphaned when it is separated from its copyright holder. The directive states that when this happens, the government can take this work and licence it themselves. This would mean that the original artist would not get any compensation for their work. 

This part of the directive is a bad idea. 

So, I was insisting for photographer to be credited as like any photographer, I would not want my work orphaned.

You were right the first time. 

The limitation is a result of the BitPay api, however we have since been in contact with BitPay and they have confirmed that only one confirmation is required within an hour of payment. It was our misinterpretation of the API docs that led us to believe that six were required in one hour before they invalidated the invoice. 

We have since changed the FAQs to reflect this. 

One confirmation is required within one hour of payment, we won't release an order until we receive six confirmations. This was always the case, we misinterpreted how the BitPay api worked. 

Hope that helps clear things up.

(That ""I don't wanna go"" still hits me really hard when I re-watch the episode). But Matt Smith is such a great doctor to follow the 10th it only seems natural to swoon towards him. He's an aged version of the romantic that he takes over. Moffat and Smith himself have great descriptions of the 11th. Moffat says, ""[the 11th is an] old man trapped in a young man's body"". While Smith views the Doctor as someone with ""a lot of blood on their hands"". Some say he's ruthless, some say his guilt starts to boil over in this incarnation, whatever he ultimately will be looked back as, I can assure you he will quickly win you over with his quirky nature, adamant personality, and his big chin :P

I'm not saying this is what happened, but imagine for a second that you were raped 40 years ago. You are finally able to come forward having been inspired by the Saville cases etc, so you file a police report. The only evidence that exists is your memory of the event. Obviously the rapist is going to deny it, which makes it your word against theirs. You don't recall the specifics very well so the expense defense QC is able to pick holes in it and make you look like a liar. Your rapist, who you know is guilty, gets let off. Imagine how horrible that would nake you feel, having nobody believe you (this is why so few rapes are actually reported).

Imagine if on top of this you were named and shamed in papers and then fined or imprisoned yourself for making 'false accusations'.

The starting point is ""presumed innocent"" - not ""innocent"" but ""*presumed* innocent.""

The trial comes to a decision - guilty or not guilty. It isn't guilty or innocent, because the trial doesn't seek to prove innocence, it seeks to determine if there is guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

One can be found guilty and still be guilty, just there isn't enough evidence to convict.

The trial found Roache not guilty. That does NOT mean he has been found innocent. It means he is still *presumed* innocent but it does not prove it. With sexual assault charges, guilt is difficult to prove because it's often he said, she said, and of course we cannot, morally, convict someone on balance of evidence or what we believe to be true, it's got to be beyond reasonable doubt. There is reasonable doubt in this case, thus the jury cannot convict.

Roache is found not guilty. That means that *presumed innocent* stands, but it's not the same as saying he *is* innocent. He might well be, but that's not what the trial concluded. The trial concluded that the evidence is insufficient to find him guilty.

He hasn't been proven innocent.

* Statistics don't play. He is not saying we aren't going to win, we are not candidates. We are outsiders. Not a squad like Man city in their prime age and ability. Arsenal are a great example of stability with the same manager. We are beginning.

* Man City and Arsenal aren't doing as well as they should.

* Team is improving, better position in table than last season.

* Newcastle's loss of Director isn't a problem for them. He couldn't give them a player to replace Cabeye.

* They know they can beat us. Play well away from home.

* We aren't trying to sign Cavani. Doesn't have any idea about the summer.

* Torres ready to come back yet. Tuesday is a better possibility.

* No other injuries, just a couple of things to assess. 

* Billy gave the talk because he is an emotional guy.

* When we drew against West Ham people said we didn't have attacking power to compete. After City people have changed their minds. He knows where we are taking it step by step. 

* Salah is selected.

* Cole has a future at Chelsea.

I said, that's not been proven. He's been found not guilty. That means only that thre is insufficient evidence to be certain of guilt. It could mean he is innocent, it could mean he's guilty but there's not enough evidence to say so. It does not mean he *is* innocent.

The trial doesn't seek to determine innocence vs guilt, it seeks to determine guilt beyond reasonable doubt. If that can't be established, averdict of ""not guilty"" must be returned. That is not equal to ""innocent"". That is how the law works.

If you cannot understand that it's not a matter of innocent vs guilt, but rather guilty vs not guilty, then you need to educate yourself on how trials operate.

Roache has NOT been found innocent. He has been found not guilty. These two things are not the same thing.

But no, the arrogant gin-swigging public-school men, whose unwillingness to compromise for the common gain and dedication to maintaining the status quo, would rather drag the whole temple down with them.

Club card works by accruing points for every Â£1 spent. Each Â£1 is effectively worth 1p. When you have accrued enough points tesco will use your built up points to ""buy"" club card vouchers. So you will need 100 points at 1p each to her Â£1 of vouchers. Tesco will only buy these vouchers for you when you have accrued a minimum number of points, which I think used to be 500 points (I.e. Â£5 of vouchers or Â£500 of spending). If tesco do not use the points to buy vouchers then they remain unused on your account until you reach the minimum. 

You will often find that some goods/services get more than 1 point per pound spent. This simply means you will accrue points faster.

 [**Great Storm of 1987**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great%20Storm%20of%201987): 

---

&gt;

&gt;The **Great Storm of 1987** was a violent [extratropical cyclone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extratropical_cyclone) that occurred on the night of 15â16 October, with hurricane-force winds causing casualties in [England](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England), [France](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France) and the [Channel Islands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_Islands) as a severe depression in the Bay of Biscay moved northeast. Among the most damaged areas were Greater London, the East Anglian coast, the Home Counties, the west of Brittany and the Cotentin Peninsular of Normandy which weathered gusts typically with a return period of 1 in 200 years.

&gt;Forests, parks, roads and railways were strewn with fallen trees, and the British [National Grid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Grid_(Great_Britain\)) suffered heavy damage, leaving thousands without power. At least 22 people were killed in England and France, and a gust of 106Â kn (196Â km/h; 122Â mph) was recorded in [Gorleston](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorleston), Norfolk.

&gt;That day's weather reports had failed to indicate a storm of such severity, an earlier, correct forecast having been negated by later projections. The apparent suggestion by the BBC's [Michael Fish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Fish) of a false alarm has become a British cultural meme, though he claims he was misquoted.

One of the major problems we have today is not having a centralised register of how people respond to treatments, relevant side effects, drug trial data etc. If you think about it, GP's and Doctors undergo no more compulsory formal training after medical school. Wouldn't this lead you to believe that an individual who graduated 30-40 years ago would have outdated knowledge?

The way i see it opening up patient records like this and compiling them centrally can really help medical professionals spot trends. For example Drug A is thought to be the gold standard for treating disease 1. With a patient database like this GP's can easily look at how patients responded to Drug A and what do you know, it turns out that when you have a large amount of data points (such as a national register) it appears that Drug A really doesn't have as great an effect as thought. If this can be spotted then GP's can decide not to prescribe the less effective ""gold standard"" and try a treatment that (nationally) appears to have a greater therapeutic effect.

I'm just about to graduate from a Biomedicine degree and this sort of stuff really interests me.

On top of that, as life has moved progressively online we are sending fewer and fewer letters. The Royal Mail was doomed.

&gt;The two banks that advised the government on the IPO, Goldman Sachs and UBS, also suggested higher valuations more than a month after the floatation. Goldman Sachs started coverage of the stock with a âneutralâ recommendation and a 12-month price target of 610p, indicating that the postal service is worth almost twice its float price (Royal Mail share price: Goldman sets 610p target, 85% above IPO price). UBS was more cautious with a âsellâ recommendation and a price target of 450p (Royal Mail share price drops after UBS starts coverage with âsellâ advice). However, both banks considered before the IPO that a higher float price could discourage institutional investors and put the sale at risk of failure.

The investment bank that handles the IPO knows the richest investors and can hook them up with good deals so that everyone wins. Company owner wants to get cash for their shares, so investment banker says okay I know a guy. He speaks to investor and says look, you're a mate so I'll give you a little bit extra on top - in exchange just remember I did you a favour.

Investor will always invest in banker's recommended IPOs because he knows banker hooks him up. He also uses banker for his other needs. Banker has great record of successful IPOs because his clients trust him, so when he makes the pitch to the company owner they are quite excited. Most owners don't care if they're going to get Â£2bn or Â£2.1bn (even though that's a real loss) - they care that they're going to get Â£2bn guaranteed through this banker instead of another guy who only has a 50/50 record of successful IPOs.

There's a fair amount of literature about it - here's a paper to get you started http://rfs.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/2/413.abstract but ultimately it does just come down to giving a little discount so everyone comes away with a smile on their face. Owner is Â£2bn richer, investor increased their investment by 25% overnight, banker took a really nice commission - everyone's going out for a party after that.

2. [This page](http://www.tesco.com/clubcard/collect-spend/#viewWays) outlines how you can currently collect Clubcard points. One good way is a Clubcard Credit Card, although I'm unsure how it compares to other credit cards on the market. They're also quite strict with who they accept (both good and bad).
3. Your vouchers will expire at some point (it's usually ~2 years from when they give them to you), so check your current balance online to see when they do. I don't think points expire in-between collection periods, though.

true,ruizscar,cnty-expat,South America,"&gt; If it helps, empathy is not something that requires the physical state of crying.

&gt; Empathy is an action and a practice that requires you to consider another persons values, ideas, opinions, beliefs, experiences, thoughts, fears, morals, memories, feelings, perspectives, goals, wants, needs.

&gt; And if you don't know about these for the person you can ask.

&gt; It is the act of considering the other person in your consciousness and actions as much as you can. You can do it whether you feel the same way as the person or not, whether you agree or not, whether you like the person or not.

&gt; It's not cut off from anyone, no matter what emotional state they are in. Which is why it's never an excuse for an abusive person to say, ""sorry I was just angry.""

&gt; All someone has to do is do it. Unless there is something that is more preferable to them (like believing they have to keep only their consciousness in the forefront at the expense of everyone else or they will no longer exist, i.e. narcissism/certain mental illnesses/eta: developmental or atypical brain processes/ptsd or someone in extreme crisis)

&gt; It takes practice, and for everyone there is always a way to be better at it, but empathy is an equal opportunity access to all humans. There are times when the reason you can't is because it's protective, and times when it's maladaptive.

&gt; It's one of the most powerful tools for health, its like a beacon. You always have it even if it may be difficult to use. But even recognizing that you can't practice enough empathy, and having that inform your actions, is in itself empathy, and it's more than enough.

Yes, I would gladly replace a 5'7"", 152 lbs player with someone bigger and taller.

You haven't proven my argument weak at all. We have no aerial threat, we have no cross threat and once they shut down Suarez and Sturridge, we have nothing else. This is how City, Arsenal and Chelsea have shut us down. This was also a major issue during the West Brom game. Their backs don't have to worry about crosses and thus don't have to swing out wide nearly as much, there's no stretching of the defense to create space in the middle to shoot from, which we take almost 60% of our shots.

For a teams like madrid/barca/bayern to be interested in a manager like Rodgers he would already have to be quite successful. He would probably have to be making deep champions league runs, so quarter/semi finals consistently and be competing at the top of the league with Liverpool for them to seriously want him. But if that was the case then why would he leave?

&gt;The **Gateshead Millennium Bridge** is a pedestrian and cyclist [tilt bridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilt_bridge) spanning the [River Tyne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Tyne,_England) in [England](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England) between [Gateshead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateshead)'s [Quays](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateshead_Quays) arts quarter on the south bank, and the [Quayside](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quayside) of [Newcastle upon Tyne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne) on the north bank. The award-winning structure was conceived and designed by architects [Wilkinson Eyre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilkinson_Eyre) and structural engineers [Gifford](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gifford_(company\)). The bridge is sometimes referred to as the 'Blinking Eye Bridge' or the 'Winking Eye Bridge' due to its shape and its tilting method. In terms of height, the Gateshead Millennium Bridge is slightly shorter than the neighbouring [Tyne Bridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyne_Bridge), and stands as the [sixteenth tallest structure in the city](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_buildings_and_structures_in_Newcastle_upon_Tyne).

""Levyâs transfer policy has cost the club countless times, in 2006 when we failed to improve the squad and lost fourth place due to lasagna gate, in 2011 as you mentioned, 2012 when we failed to buy Moutinho to replace modric, 2008 as well when Levy left selling Berba to the last minute therefore not giving us enough time to replace him and Keane.""

&gt; I don't get how people can say it's a lack of investment

I do. Lewis and Levy are billionaires - our owners are amongst the richest in England, behind (obviously) the Arab owners with endless resources and Abramovich. Over the last 5 years, our net spend is under Â£1 million.

You could argue, as many do, that that's Levy being very clever with money and being a good bargainer. But I don't buy that anymore, because on numerous occassions (as Robspur's comment points out), **there has been a failure of investment at the ctucial times**.

This summer was an exception - but we only spent all that money because we made it off selling Bale. We actually made a net profit still. 

&gt; To blame for what? Taking us from mid table to a stable top 5? ...We really shouldn't complain

You're right, and to some extent i'm playing devil's advocate. I don't want ENIC out, I *do* think we have good owners. I just want them to be more accountable, and actually more of my grievances about the management comes from issues like StubHub, ticket prices and the new stadium.

In Germany a similar study came up with a high-end figure of 85% for that country and no doubt other EU countries are similar. Compare Norway:

What rubbish.  Most official sources put it at much, much lower than that, including our own government:

&gt; In the UK data suggest that from 1997 to 2009 6.8% of primary legislation (Statutes) and 14.1% of secondary legislation (Statutory Instruments) had a role in implementing EU obligations, although the degree of involvement varied from passing reference to explicit implementation.

www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/RP10-62.pdfâ

The point about implementing the directive is a moot one, because the directive does not demand the privatisation of the Royal Mail.  Our Government decided that it would privatise, but the existing structure conformed as it was - the market was open to competition (and had been since 2006 when PostComm opened up full competition) and the Royal Mail acted as an independent organisation owned wholly by the government.

true,eastlondonmandem,english,INGERLAND,"&gt;My point is that they call themselves reporters and journalists when all they do is simply brows these Subreddits and then cut and paste articles.

Isn't that basically what reporters and journalists do these days? The Internet means you don't need to have a reporter on the ground doing the research and coming up with a quality story. No you just get an intern to look up the top trending stories and then ask them to write a few words.

&gt;And surely the solution to simply not visit them is as simplistic as it is one-eyed. Following links to a site allows you to comment argue and opine on the content therein

Just seems to me you've got a certain expectation of quality and the sites you listed aren't meeting them. So my suggestion to go elsewhere is entirely valid. If you want to comment on the content then don't listen to my advice.

The point is that being a free paid service the only way to vote is with your feet. (or in this case, your mouse)

Let me make this clear.

Murder is not the same as wrongful death.  Wrongful death can include anything that causes the death of another, even down to negligence.  It is not synonymous with murder.  OJ Simpson has never been convicted of murder.

As for your ""9 is too many"", I disagree. 9 is an extraordinarily low number. Out of around 40,000 armed response callouts, they only shot and killed people 9 times. And again, it's not saying that they are all innocent or that the shootings were unjustified.

&gt; Then again, tribalism is embedded deep in our genome, and can't be legislated out of existence. 

There are plenty of things throughout history that you could argue are 'embedded deep in our genome'. Rule of the strongest, for example, where whoever had the biggest muscles would be able to rule over their tribe. Rule of men, where women were only used for making dinner and babies. These two things have been around far longer than even nation states have, but we have overcome them (or at least begun to overcome them), partly through legislation. Hannan is arguing that apparently we should draw an arbitrary line between breaking down barriers between nations, because that is in our genome, whereas over the past few hundreds of years we have broken down barriers between sexes, races, and a whole load of other things. 

&gt; That is quite impossible and, in any case, patriotism has its uses. It is our sense of common identity that makes us willing to accept election results when we voted for the losers, to pay taxes to support strangers, to obey laws with which we disagree.

Is true. I was planning to rise up in armed rebellion when the Tories were voted in, but didn't because I realised they were voted for by fellow Britons instead of foreigners, who probably wouldn't be able to make a good choice anyway. /s

Seriously though. The reason I, and I would assume many others, accept the Tories as our legal government is because we believe in democracy, not because we believe as they were voted for by people who look and sound like us, and hold vaguely similar ideologies. 

&gt; Well, here's the thing: the Second World War was primarily ideological, ranging people for or against doctrines.

Bullshit. The others things I can see as ignorance, but this honestly sounds like something I would expect to hear from a Nazi apologist. Were the 6 million Jews killed in death camps because of their political ideology? What about the millions of other ethnic minorities, such as Slavs, Poles, Gypsies, ect. ect.? Were they all killed because their political views were different to that of the Nazi party and it's supporters?

No. It's because they weren't German, in the sense that they were Aryan. This is the bad side of nationalism, which Hannan conveniently brushes over. He doesn't mention the links between nationalism and racialism, where people don't just love their country, but they begin to think their country is superior, and the peoples of that country are superior. This is, to an extent, what the Nazis thought. They thought ethnic Germans, i.e. Aryans, were the superior race, and therefore used that as justification for the Holocaust. 

You might be able to argue that the first involvement of countries within the war was due to political ideologies, but you can't just brush over the entire fucking Holocaust!

&gt; Those who have done most to threaten peace, far from being nationalists, are usually proponents of trans-national ideologies. The Islamists today, like the Nazis and Soviets before them, claim to answer to a higher doctrine than the established rules of territorial jurisdiction and national sovereignty.

Of course you're going to find problems when the only three 'trans-national ideologies' you mention are ones that people generally already disagree with. Isn't Universal Human Rights a 'trans-national ideology'? What about activists for democracy, or liberty?

Specifically: stopping distance is based on the train's kinetic energy which increases as the square of the vehicle's speed. High speed trains travelling at double the speed of conventional trains would therefore need four times the distance left between them as usual.

TL;DR: doubling the speed of trains on a line means quadrupling the distance needed between them means halving the number of trains on the line.

""Would you play Sterling that side then? The problem for me is Arsenal generally attack towards their right hand side and Sturridge doesn't particularly defend that side - he (and Suarez when they swap) leaves a lot of space behind him when getting back into shape and on transition when the ball is lost, he's generally central so there's always room there. Considering Ozil likes to move across towards that side from his central position and considering Cissokho's weaknesses at left back, I think it imbalances us. I'd rather play Sterling that side to give us better defensive work rate and to help shut off that side.

I know Suarez and Sturridge have been swapping who defends wide but I'd look to have Suarez play wide more than Sturridge this game - play Sterling on the left and Suarez on the right and he'll be able to find space away from Koscielny's tight marking in the middle.""

Even allowing the Police a lot more leeway than I would like to, it seems unlikely to me that of the many many deaths following police contact, not one of them was a murder or manslaughter...

One thing that's true is that when Hendo has a good game we usually win; when he's nonexistent (ie: west brom) we look like we're misfiring.

&gt;*""The reason? In the next couple of years, Diamond plans to write a blockbuster analysis of how modern civilisations âmanageâ the process of change and crisis. Some of this will focus on countries such as Japan and Britain; Diamond believes, for example, that Britainâs response to the loss of its empire after the second world war was striking. âI went to Britain myself in the late 1950s and it was a time when Britain was in slowly developing crisis, with Suez, race riots, the scrapping of the last battleships,â he observes, sitting in a London hotel and looking like the stereotype of the romantic, intellectual adventurer: greying beard, tweedy jacket and a tie seemingly decorated with armadillos. â[Then] we would never have guessed that Britain would have dealt with problems of becoming a heteroÂ­geneous society as peacefully as it has. Today no one talks about the empire on which the sun never sets â Britain has a new identity.â*

Though I question the ""wisdom"" of The Economist's conclusion: I'd argue it's numerical question (immigration rate and net) as much as, if not more than a qualitative one (identity/culture), given Diamond's comments above, which seem evident and observable.

______

I think Flanagan and Cissokho should stay back more than usual, try to hold the flat back four so there are less gaps. For anyone worrying about Skrtel and Toure, just consider that they are both better ""last ditch"" defenders than they are just defenders and It's likely we'll be under a lot of pressure from Arsenal.

The midfield is lined up man to man numbers wise, keeping everyone busy. Don't know how much Ozil will track Gerrard though. Allen/Henderson/Gerrard is probably the best combination for ball retention which will be important against other possession based sides.

Sterling and Sturridge have so much pace that I don't think Wenger will be prepared to send his fullbacks too far forward. Some people will say we lack creativity without Coutinho, and that he's the link between midfield and attack. That's true but that shouldn't matter this in this formation.

Suarez plays *very* deep, right behind the Arsenal DM/CMs. With the midfield already matched up, either Mertesacker or Koscielny will have to come right out of the back four to stop Suarez being completely open and unmarked.

â¢ If Mertesacker marks Suarez then we have our magician spinning/twisting/turning away from the man with the titanic's turning circle. Free kicks all day or Luis is past him and running at goal.

â¢ If Koscielny steps out to mark Suarez, then we have Sterling and Sturridge's diagonal runs towards goal with being picked out with only the lumbering German to catch the two fastest players on the pitch.

If none if this works then at least, for once, we have a game changing option on the bench Rodgers might actually want to use. Coutinho.",0,1391791998,null,0,false,0,cf9h8i1,t3_1x9yui,t1_cf9h8i1,t3_1x9yui,null,1432296108,31,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,31

Part of that is because he was actually the coach of that team for Ajax, so he knows all the players, and part of that is because he loves the 'Ajax philosophy'. Having that said, you should not expect him to sign crazy players for your club. Ajax spend $0 this transfer period, and only send one player out for loan.

I have to say, he is not really that much of a tactical genius. He loves the 4-3-3 (as any Dutch coach should ;)), and rarely sways away from that. His game plan consists of subbing in Poulsen as a CDM for the LB in the ~60th minute and switching Blinds position from CDM to LB.

I do however think, that if given the right resources (a good youth system, some money to spend, TIME), he can really 'build'  a club. If he is given time, he will grow some excellent players. Look at Jan and Eriksen for example. 

His style is to be 'one of the boys', but he is strict when necessary. Look at [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QvE5Xj90zg) for example. Ajax was up 5-1, yet he was upset that they conceded a goal. That makes me think that he is suitable for the top. He doesn't think ""we're 5-1 up, we got this"". No, he thinks ""we should've been 5-0 up, we made a stupid mistake"".

Hope this makes some sense. If you have any questions go ahead and fire ' em!

SAF wanted to be the one to knock us off our perch. Wenger has built a legacy of survival, managing to succeed despite losing great players every year.

From what I can tell, Rodgers is a manager in it for the long-haul, as long as he's at a club where he can ultimately win things. He helped build Swansea to where it is, but Swansea will never win the league without freak investment. At Liverpool, he could feasibly win the league or CL eventually. He's not going to want to go to a big club for two years and move on, but I don't see him going to a megaclub like Bayern, Madrid or Barca because one bad season and he's out.

2. If it's an ongoing thing, eventually a. If it's bad breath, and they insist on being in my face after me moving away, I'll tell them though. Can't stand that. 

3. Not a clue. Had a useless manager once. Hinted some solutions to the problems. Was summarily ignored. Left the company for many reasons. Probably d, if I wasn't bashing my head against a brick wall. If so... b. 

4. d. Only get cards/presents for people I have some closeness to. 

5. Closest would be b. Would probably aim to speak to them in a non-formal setting away from others to warn them of the not-appreciatedness of such humour. 

6. Ergh, all those things sound terrible to me. Would probably compliment the thing I liked most, or what I feel they value. 

7. Hrm. Hard one. Depends a lot on the situation. If it was unintentional, then it's a verbal oi (done that before). If it's among friendlies, then I'd probably say something. If it's a formal meeting, it'd be an evil look during the meeting. If I think the person would change, I'd have a word. 

8. First half of c. Unless it was someone I disliked, I want to help, if they need it - too many times have I been the one upset and people pretend it isn't happening, it's awful. If it's someone who has earned my ire, then I'll ignore them. 

9. Probably c, followed by b. Telling people who are angry that they shouldn't be angry only leads to more angry. Agreeing they're a pillock gives the calmness of validation.

I linked to a Liverpool Echo rumours page (the main story was a Borini swap for Adam Johnson) a couple of days ago. It was clearly marked as a rumour and around 16 folks commented on it (mostly negatively) and a couple of folks discussed a possible summer move for Micah Richards.

It was downvoted inside a few hours to -4 (it sits at 0 because it can't go any lower!). I was unsure at the time why. 

Maybe people didn't like the idea of Johnson for Borini? Neither did I, but I thought it was worth discussing. Perhaps because it was a rumour. Well yes, but it was clearly marked on the link itself and on the Echo page as rumour. Maybe it was because it was outside the recent stickied transfer rumour threads, which it was, however this was after the transfer window had closed, so there were no more stickied threads... To the best of my knowledge it was not a duplicate either.

It wasn't a great link, but it was an eyebrow raising rumour and enough people were interested in talking about it, yet it was vehemently downvoted.

I think some folks here see themsleves as arbiters of taste and only 'proper' stories should be allowed on the front page.

I have to add I'm not a fan of the stickied transfer threads, I much preferred the stories themselves, they were much easier to see, and you didn't have to trawl through the comments to get to the latest info. That said it's just my preference, most folks seem in favour of it so that's fine.

true,DukePPUk,null,null,"&gt; And the UK: Postal Services Act 2011..

While other points are being made in another response (which I agree with), it is worth noting that just because the explanatory notes say something doesn't mean that is true. For example, every Government bill since 2000 has a statement at the top of it that it is compatible with the ECHR, but several have been found not to be.

That said, the Third Postal Directive doesn't seem to require privatisation. From the [very next paragraph](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/5/notes/division/7):

&gt; The Directive provides that member States must ensure the provision of the universal service is guaranteed and must include certain minimum requirements (see Articles 3 and 4 of the Directive).

From what I can tell of reading [the Directive](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:052:0003:01:EN:HTML) and the EC's [guide to the Postal Directives](http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/post/legislation/index_en.htm), the 2008 Directive requires that there be no restricted areas - so the Government can't ban private companies from operating any type of postal service (which they could under the earlier directives). It doesn't stop the Government from running a public postal service.

Also worth noting, the third postal directive came into force in 2010. Before the Postal Services Act 2011; the Act implements bits of it, but (I imagine) so to earlier regulations. And significantly before the Royal Mail was sold off.

The Government selling off the Royal Mail was not done on the orders of the EU, it was done under the cover of the EU.",0,1391794845,null,0,false,0,cf9ijny,t3_1x9kei,t1_cf9ijny,t1_cf9e771,null,1432296726,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The individual components of the system are worthy of attack but I think it's necessary to take the broader view that until the fundamentals of capitalism are undermined, we can't improve on anything else. How that is going to be undermined is anyone's guess. Personally I think the best hope is for a sort of spontaneous uprising of mass-apathy which will cause people to just stop going to work and stop going to Tesco until everything kind of grinds to a halt. 

For what it's worth, any resemblance between a view I express and the views of ""Marxists"" is purely incidental since I have not read Marx and am reasonably unaware of Marx's outlook.

This does not obligate me to study Marx. I find theory boring unless I make it up for myself. If I have made up Marxism for myself I must be pretty brilliant but I think it's pretty unlikely because if one percent of the apologists for capitalism that accused me of being a Marxist actually knew more about Marx than I do (zero) I'd be astonished. 

Next, you must explain what you think democracy is if you don't want me to think you're an ignoramus. What is currently referred to as democracy does not tally with what I understand the word to mean which is a system of governance where the general population have a say in how their society is run. I am not aware of any state where democracy in that sense exists except as a form of pacification - you can choose which gang of selfish arseholes will screw you if it makes you feel like you have a part in it. 

Finally, the use of these Latin logical fallacies is often the sign of a lack of the ability to express oneself. As I understand it, these are terms relating most specifically to the study of formal logic. Most people who use these terms couldn't explain in their own words what any of them mean. If it pleases you, feel free to explain to me in your own words what ""Ad Hominem"" means in the context of this exchange. Bear in mind that i am in no position to know whether your answer is correct or not because I have no training in formal logic.

Sounds good to me. Though equality in size needn't be a necessity. I'd be in favour of smaller subdivisions, with typical populations of around 500,000 to a million. Basically this would mean devolved governments for counties (and equivalent). Many might say that such subdivisions would be too small, but it works well for Switzerland whose total population is less than London, and yet is split into 26 fairly independent cantons.",0,1391799792,null,0,false,0,cf9kv5y,t3_1x9bil,t1_cf9kv5y,t1_cf9c663,null,1432297885,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,0x_,null,null,"&gt;  I am quite clearly on the anarchist side of things and maybe a communist or a socialist or something in that area.

I KNEW IT. By the way if you are an anarchist you are a radical socialist. Thats not propaganda that i suck from camerons titties, THATS ANARCHISM 101. 

Are you done resisting?

&gt; This does not obligate me to study Marx.

Wait, what? Are you suggesting that all those anarchism/socialism terms i listed are divorced from marxism? They are rooted in it. You not having any interest in Marx only shows how shallow your study of it is.

&gt; because if one percent of the apologists for capitalism that accused me of being a Marxist actually knew more about Marx than I do (zero) I'd be astonished. 

Thats part of your problem and what makes you an insufferable cunt who depicts DISAGREE as IGN'ANNNT. 

&gt; Next, you must explain what you think democracy is 

No, we do not have by any means the most desirable form of democracy. Representational, what we have isn't doing us anywhere near as close to the idealist direct democracy we all want. We couldn't even get the Alternative Vote through. 

Im fond of Social Democracy, a hybrid of an elective system, based in capitalism (which can effect rapid social change, profit is a huge motivator, it only becomes truly toxic left unregulated), but with a strong liberal slant, with a strong social justice/fairness ethic.

&gt; Finally, the use of these Latin logical fallacies is often the sign of a lack of the ability to express oneself.

Ok. You called me a sheep? You're a cunt. Fuck you. Hows that for expressing myself?

&gt; I am not aware of any state where democracy in that sense exists except as a form of pacification

Political engagement is the answer, and not going to tescos at the weekend as a general strike against capitalism is not going to replace that. Revolution is a flawed idea. In bloody or even bloodless revolution there is the ""bad anarchy"" where power vacuums are filled by popular scumbags, and we see all it takes is hunger and suffering (a failing economy will do it) for popular scumbags to muscle in. A peaceful revolution is still leaving the nation at a standstill and people wont use that free time to brainstorm a new system, they dont have the first idea how to run an advanced civilization. Evolution is the way.

&gt; Bear in mind that i am in no position to know whether your answer is correct or not because I have no training in formal logic. 

Confirmed for simpleton. LMGTFY: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Ad+hominem

&gt; Cogitate on this: 

No, make an argument and use wikipedia as a reference. I dont indulge specifics until someone addresses me on the basics. You ain't done that yet. You think skipping the weekend grocery run and calling in sick will dismantle the surveillance state, becuz Anarki r00lz!

true,agentdcf,flair8,,"What exactly is ""the right way""? This article is obnoxious because the author uses that term as though it's self-evident, when it is manifestly NOT.

His use is, in fact, symptomatic of the problem with whole conversation about the ""right way"" to play: it is vague, and profoundly unproductive. No one seems to know exactly what it means, and thus it's a phrase that is at once empty and overflowing. It's empty in the sense that it has no stable, objective meaning. To some, it's as simple as two strikers. To others, it's ""attacking football,"" to still others it's ""fluid, free-flowing"" football. And when it comes to practical terms, no one seems to agree on precisely what is required to play something like ""attacking football"": is it as simple as going 4-4-2? Or doing away with a defensive midfielder? Does it allow sitting deep and counterattacking? Does it permit slow build-up play, or does it require that you attack as quickly and directly as possible at every single opportunity? Do your players have to be supremely talented to do it? Or is it possible to play the right way if your players are merely hard-working professionals and not rhythmic dancers in football kits?

At the same time, however, playing the ""right way"" is overflowing with meaning, because it seems to many to validate Spurs' very identity. As long as we play the right way, many will claim, it doesn't matter whether we win or lose. Of course, these same people also seem to know the ""right way"" when they see it, but what they see is often inflected by the results. This is problematic, however, because playing the ""right way"" is something that is inherently about the *process* of the game, the way in which the game is played, but the perception of that process is *always* colored by the results. A one-goal win and a one-goal loss could be the exact same game with a few different bounces or borderline calls, but one will validate the team's approach while the other curses it. 

I guess what I want out of this conversation about the ""right way"" is some clarity. I'm okay with people arguing that there is a right way to play, but what that means needs to be specified. Personally, the right way to play for me is with a lot of energy--I want to see our boys *running*, really moving like they mean it, because that shows that there's *effort* and *desire*. Beyond that, I don't much care. I'd like to see some tactical flexibility, because I think it's interesting to watch when teams adapt their style of play to match their strengths and weaknesses against their opponents. I don't care if we sit deep with two holding midfielders and no striker, or if we play a high line, possession game, or whatever. As long as it's obvious that our players are playing like they really care, then that's all I ask.

The earlier series like newswipe or screenwipe were on subjects where Charlie was an expert (in comparison to say me). I was learning things about TV that I didn't know about or was hearing the opinion of an insider on the subject that was not only informative but hilarious.

Examples of this are:

[The log](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQB2mL4UBvs)

[The news report](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHun58mz3vI)

[Reality tv editing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBwepkVurCI)

He also had a mix of comedians and real experts on the show to talk about subjects that were informative. Like Ben Goldacer who talked about the pseudo science that is shoved in our face as fact on the tv.

[MMR jabs and TV](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_T1p-C8fc)

The current series falls flat in my opinion because it's just Charlie's opinion on the week, something which while funny is not something he is an expert on so i'm not learning anything by watching. The guests are also all comedy acts as well so again i'm not learning anything from them either.

**Two Days Before** the opening, contractors were *digging up* the main walkway through the park to put a forgotten-about cable into the ground.

**The Day Before**, contractors were still laying the paving in the park.

**The BMX Venue** was completed almost a week *after* the games began. When Bojo had that news conference at the start and said everything was complete and ready? Yeah. He lied. A week after the games began, the BMX venue was finally released to the broadcast technicians to lay their cables in. Meanwhile the surface of the track had become neglected and needed remedial work.

&gt; Funding Circle, a company who facilitates fast unsecured loans to businesses of Â£10k - Â£250k, are currently experiencing very high demand for borrowing. This is excellent as it drives up the rates of interest we savers/investors can charge. I am getting several loans a week in the 12-13% range at the moment.

&gt; Funding Circle are actively trying to get more savers at the moment and are running a limited time promotion offering Â£40 to any new customers (referred by existing lenders) who put Â£1000. That's 4% annual return before you begin.

&gt; With Funding Circle bad debt a real risk and normal as part of your Funding Circle planning. Expect to see failure rates of 2-5%, potentially more. Funding Circle loan applications are divided into risk bands to help this estimations. You can let the system automatically bid for you where the estimated final returns are around 5.7%, higher if you accept slower lending speeds or are prepared to pick and choose your own businesses from their plans and financial reports. There is also a secondary market with instant purchases available to fill out a portfolio as quickly as you want.

&gt; Like ZOPA, Funding Circle are only offering the Â£40 bonus to new referred members. Again, let me know if you'd like a link.

It's certainly a potentially huge resource, mostly for the reasons you mentioned, one that with the NHS we are perhaps uniquely positioned to make best use of.  With the caveats that I'm not going to opt-out and I'm doing a PhD in a molecular medicine field, I do think we have to keep a close eye on this with regards to third party usage of this data, particularly with it not anonymised.  

I don't really see why third party's need instant availability of patient identifying material - it's incredibly easy to ""blur"" data by placing it in bins without any appreciable decrease in study ""resolution"".  The Southampton Woman's Survey, for example, is a hugely invaluable database of highly personal data yet maintains patient anonymity.

[Yes, it is.](http://news.yahoo.com/jewelry-industry-self-regulate-toxic-cadmium-070746481.html) 

""Hammered by more than a year of recalls and legal setbacks, the U.S. jewelry industry has agreed to voluntarily limit the toxic metal cadmium in children's trinkets â and, in the process, has helped write what amounts to new federal regulations of its products."" Legal setbacks prompted stronger industry regulation going forward. The regulations that now exist in more progressive states like Illinois and California, as the piece says, driving the industry to have the best level of protection. It's like herd immunity in legislative form!

And the argument from ignorance joins the logical fallacies you've tried to use. Just because that initial link I provided didn't say it, doesn't mean it wasn't the case.

&gt;Also, there is nothing in ""opposing regulation"" that prevents someone who is poisoned by something such as cadmium jewelry from suing the company that poisoned them.

Ah, sneaky. As is the case in America, [the side of the aisle that pushes for less regulations also means this to include a person's ability to do just that. To sue to a degree that may recompense that person fully for immediate damages sustained and all future expenses accrued as a direct result. It's called tort reform.](http://www.gop.com/2012-republican-platform_renewing/) Just because it's not in that particular part of the platform, the opposing regulation part, doesn't logically mean it's not in the platform at all... again, moving the subject from the protections of regulations by using a causal oversimplification of the situation, another logical fallacy.

More than that though would be the continued ostracisation of Adebayor, and further dips in team confidence.  At least Sherwood has proven to the players they can play and score goals occasionally, which is a much better foundation to build on than AVB's crap.

true,wherearemyfeet,null,null,"I'll explain as best as I can.

The RM business model sees normal mail (letters etc) as their main business, with parcels as a lower priority. This was fine for decades, when sending letters was the preferred way of communicating written information, but with the advent of text messaging, emails and smart phones, the letter-sending industry has been in decline since the 90's.

However, at the same time as the internet decimating the letter-sending industry, online shopping has been a colossal boon to the parcel-sending industry. It's grown in leaps and bounds over the last decade, with new entrants into the market such as Parcel Force, FedEx and so forth really capitalising on the market growth. RM has tried it's best to keep up, but RM is a huge freighter compared to these smaller express ships, and movement is difficult for them. RM simply didn't have any extra capacity for their parcel delivery service, and were being systematically beaten by everyone else in respect of growth. Frankly, it's legal set-up was the only thing keeping it competitive. 

So, RM has a loss-making main business of sending letters, with a profit-making but stifled parcel sending service trying to prop up the whole shooting-match. The only thing RM can do in this situation is to engage in a massive restructuring process, or ""modernisation"", where it makes the parcel sending service the forefront of it's business model, and keeps the letter-sending service out the way, so it's losses didn't impinge too much on it's overall profitability. This, however, takes money. Lots of money. *Tons* of money. So, they did what other businesses in their position did: Looked to go to an IPO, raise a few billion, and restructure their business for their long-term success.

It's worth pointing out that this was going to happen under Labour, but ""unfavourable market conditions"" prevented it happening.

**TL;DR** Royal Mail need a shit-ton of liquid cash to restructure their business from being mainly about sending letters (dying market) to sending parcels (growing market). To get that cash, they did what other large businesses did and sold some shares in an IPO.",0,1391810924,null,0,false,0,cf9q8ab,t3_1x9kei,t1_cf9q8ab,t1_cf9gpcj,null,1432300414,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,satanspanties,,President of the Official Stellar Tortoise FC Fan Club,"&gt; How do people deal with this kind of shift work?

They suffer from [sleep disorders (obviously), headaches, fatique, stress, low sex drive, poor appetite control, and increased risk of certain cancers and heart disease](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_work#Health_consequences).  So there's something you can mull over while you're at work!  Expect to come to the conclusion that it's probably not worth it.

Anyway, as to how to prevent those, you will have noticed that some are also caused by being overweight or obese, and what do you know, poor appetite control is also on the list.  So keep a special eye on that one.  Depending on what the actual hours are, you may be able to eat at the same time every day, which is something we 9-5ers vastly underestimate as important to healthy eating.

In other news, make sure you're actually getting enough sleep.  It can be tempting, when you're on nights, to go to bed when you get home, sleep all morning, and then get up mid afternoon to do stuff.  When you do that, you're not really getting proper rest.  I know the bank and the post office and what have you aren't open in the evenings, so plan to do them in the morning when you finish instead.  That goes for socialising too, when on nights, you meet friends for breakfast, not dinner.  If possible, move all your bookcases and other tall, dense furniture into your bedroom for cheap sound insulation, get some big thick curtains, and go to bed.  Even if you feel like you can't sleep, lie there with your eyes closed and daydream anyway.

As for telling your body when to sleep and when to get up, don't get up and snack during sleeping hours, but do have a substantial and well balanced breakfast, then a shower when you wake up.  Don't use stimulants like caffeine to keep you awake, or suppressants like alcohol to fall asleep, you'll become reliant on them before you know it.  Get into the habit of taking a deep breath before you tell anybody off about anything, shift work makes you very short tempered.

true,MrBushido2318,eu,European Union,"I don't care that she doesn't know how to do it, it really is one of the most important things we can teach our children. I'd argue that it's only surpassed by English and Maths.

Every industry... EVERY industry has been revolutionised by computers. No really, not a single industry has gone untouched by computing. I sincerely challenge you to name one. And that's after just 10-15 years of computers becoming particularly widespread.

Also, the way that it's almost scoffed at with the idea of creating an ""e-card"". Almost as if he thought ""What useful skills can a 5 year old gain from making an e-card?"". When I was 5, I made cards in class, what useful skill was learning to glue bits of crepe paper and glitter to a folded piece of card? But lets forget about that it's analogous to what 5 year olds are doing already, and focus on what it likely entails to create an e-card. You will have to position shapes, images and text on the screen using coordinates. So E-cards have the potential to teach children basic geometry in a purely abstract fashion. Yes you are doing exactly the same thing with the crepe paper, but there is no abstraction there, you might be placing the crepe paper at the point (5cm,10cm) away from the bottom left corner of the card, but does creating an actual card cause you to actually think that way? The abstraction of things in to mathematical concepts is a hugely useful skill, e-cards will teach you that.

What if the e-card idea is promoted to creating games for 10 year olds? ""HAH!"" the Luddite Paxman would say ""you can't learn anything from making games!"". Wrong you fucking imbecile, to write a game you have to understand geometry, you have to understand conditional logic and finite state machines, to make things move in a non-linear fashion you have to have a basic understanding of physics and momentum. What use is this? Well it's a fun way of simulating reality for kids, it has immediate feedback and teaches a number of useful mathematics. Why is the ability to simulate reality important? Well, a there probably hasn't been a house that was built without a physics simulation, financial markets use computers to make predictions based on the information they are given. I could list a trillion reasons creating simulations is a practical skill, but this comes back to how NOTHING has gone unaffected by the revolution we've seen in technology.

My previous job was creating reports for a company. When I first started it this meant querying information from the sales database and using spreadsheets to turn that information in to a readable format that various managers could read. When I left the company that process was completely automated through a basic web site front-end. The information they have is never more than a day old, compared to having a weekly report generated. The net effect of this was that the business saw a huge decrease in delays because they were aware of anything that was running late the day it was late, rather than it being lost in limbo over 6 days. In turn this increased our departments out put significantly. All because a administrative assistant knew how to ""write code"".

One question I'd like to ask Paxman is what he thinks about the importance of being taught typing at school. I have a feeling he's never had to do it in his life, ""that's a secretaries job"" and as a result is a pretty bad person to conduct an interview on technology.

I posted this on another sub, so context might be a bit weird, but here goes.

 &gt;Have you looked at their manifesto? You can google ""lib dem manifesto 2010"" to get it. Here are their first priorities verbatim:

&gt;**Fair taxes** that put money back in your pocket

&gt;* The first Â£10,000 you earn tax-free: a tax cut of Â£700 for most people
&gt;* 3.6 million low earners and pensioners freed from income tax completely
&gt;* Paid for in full by closing loopholes that unfairly benefit the wealthy and polluters

&gt;**A fair future** creating jobs by making Britain greener

&gt;* Break up the banks and get them lending again to protect real businesses
&gt;* Honesty about the tough choices needed to cut the deficit
&gt;* Green growth and jobs that last by investing in infrastructure

&gt;**A fair chance** for every child

&gt;* Ensure children get the individual attention they need by cutting class sizes
&gt;* Made possible by investing Â£2.5 billion in schools targeted to help struggling pupils
&gt;* Give schools the freedom to make the right choices for their pupils

&gt;**A fair deal** by cleaning up politics

&gt;* Put trust back into politics by giving you the right to sack corrupt MPs
&gt;* Restore and protect hard-won British civil liberties with a Freedom Bill
&gt;* Overhaul Westminster completely: fair votes, an elected House of Lords, all politicians to pay full British taxes

&gt;Obviously, not every promise has been fulfilled. The one that they like to go on about the most is the Â£10,000 threshold, lifting some of the lowest paid in the country out of tax completely. You might say that that's off-set by benefit reductions, but is a tax cut not preferable to giving you your own money back? As for green taxes, [their proposal fell foul of EU law](http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/flight-of-fancy-is-air-tax-pledge-just-so-much-greenwash/5947). The treasury could have put more effort into it, but as it's effectively a political institution and will be dominated by the Conservatives, who have a dual interest in not taxing polluters *and* making the Lib Dems look bad (which has obviously been a very effective campaign by them), they didn't.

&gt;They've been pushing to break up the banks, have you noticed Lloyds TSB is two banks now?

&gt;As I understand, the pupil premium scheme has been brought in, albeit the quoted Â£2.5bn figure (which, let's be honest, was ambitious) is over the five year term, which the manifesto didn't mention.

&gt;The rise of free schools championed by the Conservative party is what I understand giving schools the freedom to make the right choices means. Bear in mind that does sometimes mean they will make choices you don't like - that is what freedom is.

&gt;I believe the Lib Dems did try to give people the right to sack corrupt MPs, but it got lost in the pipeline due to complications about when exactly should a by-election be triggered by constituents. I mean - it needs to be because of the actions of an individual MP - you can't just sack an MP halfway through a parliament because of wider national politics, that's not constitutionally how our government works. I'd chalk this up to a naive policy that the Lib Dems probably won't be bringing up again now they're an actual government party.

&gt;I tried to find some information about the freedom bill. It looks like they published it but it got lost in parliament, as many bills do.

&gt;They tried to push for FPTP, but obviously in a coalition government with the Tory party they would never accept it - so the Tories cunningly met the Lib Dems in a compromise on AV, which nobody has ever wanted, ensuring a 'no' vote and making the Lib Dems look bad. It was a master stroke. They also blocked the Lib Dems' attempt to reform the House of Lords.

&gt;Overall, I think, considering that the Lib Dems have fewer than 60 MPs compared to the Conservatives' more than 300 - and how incompatible the two parties really are - they have certainly pushed over their weight and delivered *more* promises than they are ""supposed to"" given their share in the Government.

&gt;It's also worth noting that they *had* to go into coalition with the Conservatives. The other options were go into coalition with Labour (deeply unpopular, held power for 13 years, still wouldn't have a majority even if they joined the SNP too!) or letting the Conservatives run a minority government, which wouldn't last the five years and would jeopardize investment and be seen as irresponsible by the Lib Dems and confirm in everybody's mind that they are not ready for power. Coalition with the Tories was the least bad option out of three, and it is the only correct option they had. They knew it would affect their popularity, and it would be difficult, but *nevertheless it was the right thing to do and they did it*. But people who don't really pay attention just see them as selling the country out to grab at power. Nothing could be further from the truth, in my mind.

&gt;But this is about tuition fees, isn't it, really? This is because the Liberal Democrats signed a pledge to vote against any increase in fees, even though the wider political context heavily suggested they would end up in a coalition with a party (either of them) committed to raising them. It was a stupid promise for them to make, but as you can see it was hardly their flagship policy. Clegg has since apologised (but it should be noted, he apologised for making the promise, not raising fees), but honestly, I didn't believe at the time that they wouldn't raise fees, it was obvious that they would have to. And really, please don't take offence, but anybody who voted for them *just because of that pledge* only has themselves to blame.",0,1391812536,null,0,false,0,cf9qy3p,t3_1x9kei,t1_cf9qy3p,t1_cf9hosy,null,1432300754,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,insoundfromwayout,null,null,"There is a difference between being an expert in your field and not knowing anything about it. Especially when you are trying to encourage it being *taught*.

There are lots of false comparisons this thread like ""Health minister cant perform brain surgery either""  - but this is bullshit. She is leading a *teaching* initiative, about how easy it is to teach children how to code, how easy it is for children to pick it up, how easy it is for teachers to learn how to teach it. 

The examples of other ministers not being experts in specifics of their field is not fair because not being able to perform brain surgery does not undermine the job of Health Minister. It does not reflect badly on the things he is trying to do.

This coding thing is totally different, because almost every point she makes is undermined (or completely obliterated) by the fact she doesn't know how to code. In fact, I will bullet point them for the lazy. She says-
 
 
 - **It is easy to learn to code. You can do a lot in a short space of time: you can build a website after just one hour of learning.**

    - *if it really is that easy, then why hasn't she set aside an hour and done it before coming on newsnight? Why hasn't she set aside 20 hours one weekend and got reasonably good at it? Either she is not committed, or it is more complex than she is making out, and her point is undermined.*

 - **You can learn to *teach* to code in about a day.**

  - *Same point - if she is expecting teachers to be able to go from no experience in coding to being able to teach it in A DAY, then why hasn't she done the days work required? Either she is not committed enough to work for a single day, or she is lying when she said someone can learn to teach it in a day, which undermines her point.*

 - **PAXO:""This whole initiative is based on a falsehood: It is not essential to learn how to code"" - DEXTER: ""I think that in the modern day economy code is really a vital skill.** 

  - *Hearing that something is an essential or vital skill from someone who doesn't have even the most basic level of skill in that area undermines their point.*

 - **PAXO: ""What *is* code?"" DEXTER: ""It is the language you use to instruct computers"" PAXO: ""But it doesn't mean anything"" DEXTER: ""Well it doesn't mean anything to you... or indeed to me, because I don't know how to code.""**  
  
  - *People, especially children and teachers, are going to be asking her lots of questions about code often, because she is the minister for coding. Her inability to answer them with any degree of expertise undermines her role.* 

 - **Finally, this is a skill that you *really* need.** 

  - *Again, she is saying that coding is essential in a modern job market. The same market where she stood a few weeks ago in an office and was offered the job of 'Minister of Coding' without knowing how to code.*

This woman cannot be the best person in the country for that job. Are we really to believe that we are being lead by the best amongst us, that this woman is the absolute best person to run this?
