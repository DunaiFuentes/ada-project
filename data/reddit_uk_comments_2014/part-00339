Your connection speed and download speeds are in **kilobits** per second. Not **kilobytes**. Ive screwed up the maths which is why I got confused about the fact you were downloading at an impossible speed! Assuming 1024 bits = kilobit, and 1024 kilobits = megabit, it's equal to just over a **megabit** per second. 

Data size = bits, bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes. 

Data transfer speeds = kilobits, megabits, gigabits  (no terabits unless you bond multiple 100mbps lines).

From Wikipedia:

&gt; Most commonly, measurements of data transfer rate are reported in multiples of unit bits per second (bit/s) or occasionally in bytes per second (B/s). The data rates of modern residential high-speed Internet connections are most commonly expressed in multiples of bits per second, such as megabits per second (Mbit/s).

Never seen anything express in the occasional ""bytes"" per second because a ""byte"" is 8 bits.

1. Listen (Episode 4) - What more could you want? this has interaction with the doctor's timeline, interaction with a companion's timeline, some lore, story arc continuity, and a unique and interesting 'enemy of the week'

2. The Caretaker (Episode 6)
Who doesn't love when The Doctor invades his companions' 'Real' lives? The whole Math/PE/Soldier thing REALLY showcased The Doctor's humorous stubbornness that we have always loved.

3. Time Heist (Episode 5)
This gets high marks for being a well written story within the genre and decent use of emotion and believable but important and sane use of timey-wimey.

4. Robots of Sherwood (Episode 3) This episode didn't have much of a payoff at the end, but the episode as a whole allowed The Doctor to be both humorous and heroic, and both intelligent and ignorant enough to utilize the human assets in playful ways. So much fun.

5. Dark Water/Death In Heaven (11&amp;12) Missy was a wonderful addition to the system, and we got to have a serious emotional and thought provoking experience between The Doctor and Danny. The downside is that it came with a cheap and clunky explanation of death, and some moments of suspended disbelief about the science of it all, as well as the cost of selectively choosing to say 'goodbye' again to one departed character and not others. (I don't need a nod to the Brigadier every time Kate is in an episode.)

6. In The Forest Of The Night (Episode 10) - Straight forward classic 'Who' story of the week, less clever, but made it up with The Doctor interacting with children and companions.

7. Mummy of the Orient Express (Episode 8) Same as 'forest' only replace the children and companions with the Doctor being more clever.

8. Flatline (Episode 9) Not much story, but a LOT of funny.

9. Kill The Moon (Episode 7) Another science heavy episode where the science wasn't as believable. The emotional scene at the end was its only redemption. 

10. Into The Dalek (Episode 2) The Magic School Bus + Doctor Who. Not much humor, not much *meaningful* companion interaction.

11. Deep Breath (Episode 1) I LOVE the Paternostra gang. This episode was disappointing for each character involved. The only redeeming quality is that this teased Missy, and had moments of humor, but even those could have been done better.

The middle of the run showed the Doctor's relationship with his companions so wonderfully. Most of this series felt very generic monster of the week type stuff...with a WAY heavy focus on robotic/mechanical enemies.

Yes, that's true. The tricky thing is that there is a world of difference between an actual entrepreneur who starts and runs a business and a upper ranking bonus–hoover in a LIBOR–n–FX–fixing, mis–selling, tax–dodging bank who spends all day cutting iffy deals and got the job because they speak with the right accent, went to the right schools and go on holiday at the right ski resort (and are tall, tan well and have executive hair—no joke, it makes a big difference to earnings).

10 megabytes, 1.75 megabytes per second. 6 seconds. Again, bytes. The unit of a 1 byte per second is the same as 8 bits per second. If you're expecting to see the number 16 and you see the number 2 you've probably mixed those two units up. Seeing something download at 1.75 MB/s is not a reason to think my internet connection speed is 1.75mbit, it's a reason to think it's 14mbit, 8 times more.

Hell, even in the original image it should have been obvious. I'm downloading a file that's just under a gigabyte in size. I'm downloading at just over a mega**byte** per second. A thousand megabytes at one per second is a thousand seconds, or about 15 minutes.  If I were downloading a gigabyte at a megabit per second it would be 2 hours.

The Roma isolate themselves from the general population, so even though education is free and compulsory they refuse to send their children to school. Some of them don't even register their children at birth so they don't exist. They only go to the state for papers when they want to travel abroad.

When they do send their children to school, they rarely attend class, they only send them for the £20 benefits they get from the state (some Roma families have 8-10 children so they can get a minimum wage just by sending their kids to school).

Overall I thought this season was decent. Not my favourite season of the show, but there was plenty to like. Definitely better than Season 7

1) Listen

This episode is just great to me. Stylistically it's similar to many of Moffat's previous works,  right up until the twist at the end. It's almost like Moffat deconstructing his own work and playing with our expectations. Easily my favourite of the series and one of my favourite episodes of modern who.


2) Flatline

After the success that was Mummy on the Orient express, I was exited to see what Jamie Mathieson would do next. As it turns out Flatline was even better. The combination of a brilliant concept with equally good writing made one of the best episodes of the season.


3) Dark Water/ Death in Heaven

I know many people here didn't like the finale, but I personally thought it was great. Missy's character was amazing, Capaldi had some of his best moments so far and the bittersweet ending left me wanting more.


4) Mummy on the Orient Express

Just an overall good episode. Interesting concept and great resolution. Jamie Mathieson is 2/2, I hope we see him again next season.


5) Time Heist

Probably the best thing about this episode was it's interesting style. It was great to see a heist type episode from Doctor Who and there really wasn't much to complain about. It's ending was like the ending of ""Hide"" but actually done right. And the time travel shenanigans were fun as well.


6) Deep Breath

Capaldi's first episode. This episodes extended run time made it feel much slower than it probably should have, ad there was perhaps a little too much filler. Overall though I liked this episode, especially the antagonist and the ambiguity of it's demise.


7) Into the Dalek

Something rubbed me the wrong way about the crew running around corridors inside the Dalek as though it were designed to  have physical objects moving around inside it. That seems like something of a security flaw. This episode had a few other problems, but overall I thought it was decent.


8) Robots of Sherwoood

Doctor who has done campiness before, but it's usually something I tolerate rather than enjoy. This episode was funny in parts and the bickering between the Doctor and Robin was pretty good. But the overall silliness felt out of place in a season so intentionally dark. Also the ending was pretty stupid.


9) The Curator

I found this episode to be somewhat boring and some parts made me cringe a little. Overall it was fairly forgettable though. Not terrible, but not an episode I'd go out of my way to rewatch.



10) Kill the Moon

This stretched my suspension of disbelief a bit too far. For starters, the concept: How has no human ever noticed a giant living thing inside the moon. We have studied it a lot, that seems like something we should know. Furthermore, I don't mind monsters that don't make scientific sense (e.g. the boneless were great) but if you're going to apply scientific explanations to them, please make sure you're correct (spider prokaryotes, I'm looking at you). My biggest issue though is probably how the moral choice at the end is framed and how there are essentially no consequences for anything that happens in this episode. It just feels cheap.


11) In the Forest of the Night

Another weird concept, annoying actors and noone actually does anything the entire episode. Seriously if everyone just stood still and did nothing, the episode would have the same conclusion. Also the lost sister reappearing at the end for no reason. What? Strange is the word I would  use to describe this episode.

Without question, claiming that removing Ludendorff from a position of influence, so that Hitler never got his break is the definition of simplistic.

I'll be simplistic now: There were two main catalysts for Germany's uprising and militarisation in the 30's - the reparations demanded by the Treaty of Versailles, which crippled the country in a way we can barely imagine nowadays, and a general, continent-wide attitude of anti-semitism, which, brought together, created a perfect storm of situations, out of which would always have grown something resembling the National Socialists. 

Hitler being at the helm was a culmination of many extraordinary circumstances - surviving the gas in WW1, being arrested and imprisoned in 1924 and having the time to write his book, being backed by Ludendorff, etc etc...If any one of those lucky chances had been removed, we could have seen a much more competent, less unstable ruler take charge of Germany's revenge, and the outcome of WW2 may have been very different.

For a long time, I agreed with Farage, and left senior school believing that the Versailles treaty alone made WW2 inevitable, but I was 16 and only had one perspective to work with. I know now that it is much more complicated than that, because I grew up and did my own research and read books and watched documentaries and stuff.

Britain wanted to punish Germany, but enable it to recover so that they could resume trade.

France wanted security. This could only be done through Britain and America guaranteeing France's western border, which they were unwilling to do, or through the dismemberment of Germany.

The result was a series of compromises which produced the world of all worlds. Germany was weakened, but not enough to ensure France held a long term advantage. Germany was punished, but the blame inside the state was placed on minorities rather than militarism. Germany became a democracy, but the sovereign will of the German people was prevented by a treaty which forbade the union of Austria and Germany and abandoned hundreds of thousands of people in countries which were not their own.

In short, Versailles was a fuck up and when Hitler and other demagogues said they wanted to overturn it, they weren't entirely unjustified. That caused our problems going forwards.

false,Chesterdog123,null,null,"&gt;The unit of a 1 byte per second is the same as 8 bits per second. 

Correct.

&gt;Seeing something download at 1.75 MB/s is not a reason to think my internet connection speed is 1.75mbit, it's a reason to think it's 14mbit, 8 times more

Correct.

I think we are arguing the same point using different SI units. One kilobit, (or 1 kbit), is 1000 bits and **not** 2^10 bits = 1024 bits.

Therefore, in bits per second in ascending order we see this:

* one kilobit = 1000 bits 
* one megabit = 1,000,000 bits 
* one gigabit = 1,000,000,000 bits

Since we know there are 8 bits in a byte, you could express the speed in **bytes** per second, but you would come up with a different answer:

* one kilobyte = 8,000 bits 
* one megabyte = 8,000,000 bits
* one gigabyte = 800,000,0000 bits

Thus if your connection speed (or download speed, whichever you are measuring) is 1.75 mega**bytes** per second, your equivalent speed in mega**bits** per second is 14.

Edit: Formatting (x3)

Edit 4: Never said
&gt;...nothing is ever bytes

Just said that data transfer speeds are measured in bits per second. You are claiming that a Mega**byte** per second is the same as a mega**bit** per second. Which it really isn't. 

Edit 5: Just reviewed my first reply, and I can see where I have screwed up. Please accept my apologies fellow human:

&gt;Your image shows a speed of 1,133 KILOBITS per second, not KILOBYTES. Your browser shows ""KB/s"" which is incorrect. Also, your image makes no sense. If your connection speed is 1,133 kilobits per second that is the equivalent of downloading at over ~~140 megabytes a second~~ **1.133 megabits per second,** ~~so it should have taken you just short of a second to download Ubuntu!~~ so it would take you about 15-20 minutes to download about 1GB.

The people who say video games cause violence believe in some world of fantasy psychology where a well adjusted person can be exposed to images of violence and it somehow brainwashes them to want to go out and replicate the scenes they've seen. Clearly we don't see Grand Theft Auto shootouts on a weekly basis, it's crap. We are starting from a point where none of the viewers of the content have the damaged mindset to go out and replicate what they see, bar the one or two that come along every so often and we all quite rightly turn to the TV and say ""but they were clearly *already crazy*""

Meanwhile a lot of people (not all) do already hold sexist, misogynist views on the other hand. The videogame argument here is that you could play the show to people who dont hold those views and it would make them sexist: again, clearly from the outcry we can see that's not the case.  But for those people who do already hold those views seeing a show like this parrot the same views is reaffirming. (Even if they can see that it's a character,  they could say ""yeah Daniel whoever is a dick but you have to admit what he's saying is spot on'.) Unlike the video game argument you don't need to load up the hardware and start shooting, you can directly go out and start replicating what you've seen because ""it's not illegal it's just bantz innit?"" People do behave like this in society all the time because even before Dapper Laughs was a thing, they hold sympathetic views to the 'character'. Getting rid of the show won't stop people holding those views no,  but at the same time we don't need to be reinforcing them.

And on the comparisons with Murray and Garnet it's been said but both of those do what they do with a fuck sight more skill than Dapper Laughs.

I'm not looking out for the actions of a class.  I'm not trying to be a class.  I don't like a class.  I don't hate a class.  I don't hate anyone.  I regard everyone as human beings, not 'proles' or 'toffs'.  The money or assets someone has dictates what they can get for themselves whether they have a penny or a billion pounds.  

What I am doing is supporting the idea of the fundamentals of trade - that two people can transact when they agree on a price.  Full stop.

As it happens having thought some more here's my idea for fixing this.  Let this guy rent out at whatever price he wants.  The NHS then leaseholds to or part owns property for their workers so that they can live close to hospitals.  That way they can subsidise the rent or price so that people who cannot afford to live close to the hospital and work shifts can do so.  If this is done for people that work in hospitals, and similar arrangements for jobs on similar pay in places where real estate is expensive, then the issue is solved for people in this situation.

However I'm still not in support of a private landlord having to do anything aside from follow the law and set a price they want to set.  If they set it too high they see reduced demand.  So if the NHS wishes to do this I would expect them to pay market price to whoever they were getting the property from.

#Explanations, caveats and answers to common questions. 
**The level of unemployment is not calculated from the number of people on out-of-work benefits** so sanctions or the actions of job centres will not affect it. These figures are based on a survey called the Labour Force Survey which samples around 40-45 thousand people every quarter. There are unemployed who are not entitled to out-of-work benefits  (e.g. those with a large household income due to a spouse, those with large savings, or those on sanctions) and there are people who claim JSA but are not unemployed (e.g. those who work less than a certain number of hours or fraudsters), so the two are not the same. The number of people claiming out-of-work benefits is reported separately as the Claimant Count. (See above for those figures)

Zero-hour contracts are not regularly measured (they were measured once in Apr-Jun 2014 at 2% of employment or 1.0% of full time and 4.9% of part time), however there is some regular measure of “underemployment”  by measuring those who are in part-time work but wish to be in full-time work. People self-select whether they are full time or part time. Equally those on temporary contracts who wish to be permanent are counted. (See above for these figures)

The rate of unemployment is an economic measure of spare labour in the workforce not a political measure of how well a government is doing at making sure everyone is happy with their job situation. As such, those on workfare, government training programmes or unpaid internships are not counted as unemployed; they do not currently have spare labour to add to the economy. However those on “Government supported training &amp; employment programmes” are reported separately so you may recast the figures should you wish. (See above for these figures) 

The definition of unemployment requires someone to be actively seeking work in the last four weeks and able to start work in the next two weeks. Those who are out of work and want a job but don’t meet this definition are reported separately under Inactive. (See above for these figures)

The figures are calculated by the independent Office of National Statistics based on internationally agreed conventions. The government cannot interfere with the calculation of the figures or set the way in which they are calculated. However knowing how the numbers are calculated does mean governments can set policy accordingly and create targets which may not be in the best interest of the public. 

The numbers are seasonally adjusted, so there should be no effect from things such as Christmas jobs.

Given that the numbers are based on a survey, the figures can never be perfectly accurate and there is a margin of error, e.g. the 95% confidence interval for the unemployment rates is ± 0.2%. The numbers should be seen as approximate and are best understood in terms of the trends they show over time.

That makes him a comedian, a bad one, but a comedian. At the very least a performer with an audience, perhaps just a personality, but not one who needs to be banned or accused of crimes or thought crimes he hasn't committed.

There was a significant amount of it, especially in France and it had been exacerbated by many thinking that Bolshevism was a Jewish led thing, but Jews in Germany were among the most integrated of any Jewish contingent in Europe, so much so that when hitler started he had to exclude Jewish war veterans from his policies. Though it was prominent in Bavaria 

Much more important in accelerating the rise of nazism was the failure of banks in the Great Depression wiping out the savings of the middle class. The centre right parties then tried to use hitler as their pawn, led by the ineffectual Von papen, while Hindenburg at this point was senile. In fact the last election before hurler took office saw a reduction in the number of seats the nazis acquired

Anger at versailles propelled hitler to power  certainly, and if it hadn't been hitler it could have been another right wing demagogue. But anti semitism wasn't integral to this. It was more the eroding of living standards for the middle class combined with the continued ineffectuality and underestimation of other right wing parties of the nazi organisation.

Firstly the audience is separate from the performer. You cannot expect everyone to get the joke on the same level, or that they won't see the irony. A well known example would be Till death do us part whose main character was taken up by far right organisations despite the intention to laugh at not with the character. Also see Catcher in the Rye which inspired a few crazies to kill people, not the author's fault that some mentally disturbed took it that way.

His demographic is the laddish working class man who is 'traditional' in their gender politics and like shock comedy. The sort of dark comedy about rape, murder and violence I found funny at about 12 but some people enjoy later. The line appears to be he is comfortable with making provocative jokes to women and being mildly offensive. The vines he put up clearly show those women laugh along and are his sort of audience that may appear strange to you that they would allow these offensive comments (and are likely more comfortable with far worse on a drunken night with friends). He hasn't committed any crimes so there is the line.

I wouldn't exactly say it is satire in it's entirety. Some of it is a caricature of his own personality, some of it 'everyman' jokes that he identifies with and some is just supposed to be shocking. I would say if you don't like it just ignore it.

But then again, the current economic policies of the Tory party seem to be:

- Encouraging a ""boom"" by deliberately engineering a housing bubble, a policy that Cameron explicitly criticized during previous Labour governments.

- Quantitative easing, which effectively involves printing enormous amounts of money and giving it to the banks. Much of this money has found it's way into both the Stock Market and the London property market, creating unsustainable booms in both.

- Changing corporate tax law in order to make Britain into a tax haven, giving us short term gains whilst weakening the tax bases of our neighbours and trading partners.

- Lowering taxes for the wealthy, increasing inequality. 

- Failing to balance the books and deal with the deficit.

- Blaming everything on poor unemployed people, and in some cases indirectly killing them by removing their benefits.

- Crossing their fingers and hoping that some sort of fracking based boom will occur, and kick in fast enough to keep things going before their other policies drive us to bust.

The Labour party isn't much better. At least when they have a policy at all.

Is there? I haven't seen evidence that this claim is true. Let's test this, shall we? It's fairly easy to test. There are, at the time of posting, 39 comments in this thread. The following posts insult UKIP or Farage:

* /u/lithborn's post calling Farage a twat ([Permalink](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2m1wmc/nigel_farage_the_armistice_was_the_biggest/cm07ynf)). Gilded.

* /u/elsparx's post calling Farage a fuck face ([Permalink](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2m1wmc/nigel_farage_the_armistice_was_the_biggest/cm08vfa)). Not gilded.

* /u/lithaborn's post accusing Farage of ""talking out of his arse with the opinion of a schoolchild"" ([Permalink](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2m1wmc/nigel_farage_the_armistice_was_the_biggest/cm09l91)). Not gilded (note: posted after your comment).

* /u/Mosrael calls Farage ""captain hindsight"" and asks ""who the fuck cares"" what he thinks ([Permalink](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2m1wmc/nigel_farage_the_armistice_was_the_biggest/cm0985e)). Not gilded.

* /u/pharao007 calls Farage a muppet ([Peramlink](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2m1wmc/nigel_farage_the_armistice_was_the_biggest/cm094yy)). Not gilded.

So that's one in five comments (or one in four posted before your comment) directly insutling Farage that actually got gilded, and it was the one which had a detailed and informed response to his claim.

So unless those other four comments get gilded soon, your claim that ""Theres literally a guy who Gilds every anti ukip/farage post"" is in fact wrong. And if they get gilded soon, what's to say it wasn't you to prove me wrong.

Also Farage is a twat. Because if you are gonna go gilding posts that insult Farage/UKIP to prove me wrong, I'd like to be in on that, and if I don't get gilded that just proves my point more.

false,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"Firstly, yes, if you want to generalise an entire country of people, meeting ""several"" of them isn't enough to do so. There are too many factors that come into play aside from just their country of origin to make such a judgement. You are doing yourself a disservice if you make judgments of a person's personality and abilities based solely on their passport or the colour of their skin. 

The example you give us harmless enough to say here, but if you were to use that kind of judgement in a formal setting, like in hiring practices, that would be straight up racial discrimination. Just try it. Try suggesting that, for example, ""Germans are hard workers, Italians are lazy, so we should hire the German"" as a reason to hire a German person over an Italian person. Doesn't matter how many Germans and Italians you've met, that's still racial discrimination and you would be taken to court if you tried using that as a reason.

Secondly, the comparison is apples to oranges. How many Germans are their in the world and how many Muslims are there in the world? 80 million vs 1.6 billion. How spread out are Germans compared to Muslims? Muslims come from almost every country in the world. Germans come from Germany. You could suggest that most Germans share a culture, but to suggest that Muslims around the world share the same culture is just laughable.

Would you also make generalisations on all the Christians in the world based on ""several you met""?

Say I went to Nigeria and meet 50 Christians who practice female genital mutilation (which is more prevalent amongst Christians than any other religion in Nigeria). Should I then draw the conclusion that the ""Christian culture"" is corrupt and that Christians are bad people?

No, I can't. Christianity isn't a culture, it's a religion shared by billions of people. Even as a religion, Christianity has many different versions and sects, just like Islam. If Christianity is the cause, or the indicator, then why are most Christians perfectly decent people? It may be a factor, but not enough to create a generalisation over the entire religion and all its adherents.

You're right, humans are great at recognising patterns, because it used to be an evolutionary advantage. In fact, we're so good at it that we recognise patterns where none exist. We see the face of jesus on a piece of toast. We win a couple of games at the casino and think we're on a winning streak. We fail to distinguish cause and effect from coincidence. This is why we don't rely on pattern recognition alone to draw conclusions in science. We need an explanation, we need significant statistical analysis, we need to be able to reliably predict and explain something before we consider it a rule or a law.

I think you mean opium; heroin is brown.

Interestingly, British soldiers died fighting in the 'opium wars' in China, which was how the British empire crushed the organised Chinese resistance to the industrial scale drug dealing it used to subjugate the formerly self-sufficient Chinese and further enrich itself. 

And that's the sort of thing that makes me a bit uncomfortable with the fact that the poppy has seemingly come to represent *all* the war dead, rather than the ordinary civilians conscripted to fight in the world wars which were about national survival instead of conquest.

And there are as many differences as there are in Moffat's finales. RTD has a really easy flowchart.

1) Alien threat to Earth. If available insert looming prophecy about the Doctor or a companion dying. Choose 2a or 2b.

2a) Include Daleks. Introduce a leader for the Daleks so that the Doctor can have someone to speak to. Include some moral dilemma regarding the Doctor, bonus points if it's a comparison with the Daleks.

2b) Include the Master. Have the Master taunt the Doctor by doing something horrible to the human kind.

3) Write yourself in a corner. Resolve with a deus ex machina (I'm still flabbergasted at the fact that Doomsday actually ended with a logical resolution).

4) End with a cliffhanger.

You can say what you want about Moffat's finales, but while retaining a basic plot the first three times they didn't have the exact same structure like Davies'.

Organ donation is a wonderful thing, but if you make it compulsory it ceases to be a donation. It wouldn't bother me personally (I'm already registered anyway), but I can see that others might be uncomfortable with having their organs ""taken"" as opposed to ""given"". There is a risk that people who would otherwise have donated, would opt out out of principle. 

I say keep it as a positive decision, but put more effort into getting donors to sign up.

He is still my favorite doctor though which is great! I guess another redeeming factor of the episode for me was the Tumblr reference. lol.

&gt; All in all the series WAS weak, but saved by interaction with Clara, who, at times, thinks that she has finally pinned the Doctor's personality down, only for him to continue to be the mysterious yet heroic time lord with experiences and foresight to continue to surprise her.

That's what I thought about Clara too. She had a better character development this season and people still hate her. I guess Clara changed the 12th Doctor a little bit.

The reason this is good news - YEY YOU HAVE A JOB

The reason this is bad news - ~~the total income tax receipts the government is receiving are falling~~  the total tax the government is getting is falling because the income tax received is not raising as fast as they expected it too. [Article this is explained in](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/tax/11162272/If-Britain-is-booming-why-is-the-deficit-growing.html)

This means the majority of these employed people are, not paying income tax because they are below the personal allowance tax threshold (£10,000 per annum) &amp;/or are receiving credits/welfare equal to their contributions.

This means a lot of these employed people are still receiving welfare and are not contributing financially to the country in taxes other than VAT.

--- below here be speculation ----

This likely means that they are in part time work and are probably not earning a wage which raises them out of poverty.

NO!!  That's just the wrong still in the 1950-1970's mind set.  OK, Windscale was a huge fuck up based on the UK trying to rapidly gain nuclear weapons and to go toe-to-toe with the US and USSR a lot of safeguards were bypassed and a lot of waste was produced, but this was when electricity was almost a waste product from producing plutonium and enriched uranium to kill other people.  Nearly all countries generated a lot of waste all in the name of getting bombs or dual use to get bombs and provide power.  Six mile, Windscale and Chernobyl were major mistakes, but under the pressures of cold war logic.

It's now 2014, and this hang over mindset of ""but it's dangerous!  We don't want another Chernobyl!"" to me is just bullshit.  The public perception is still somewhere in the 1970's which means that anytime anyone says ""OK, lets budget for clearing up our sketchy, weapon chasing nuclear history"" will get voted out because the public see this as ""funding nuclear"" which in their collective mind is a bad thing.  It's like shitting on your own doorstep but refusing to buy cleaner because poop is dirty and you don't want to be linked to it.  Ultimately, there is still poop on your own doorstep.

If the Green party actually wanted to be green, they should be touting policies to safeguard our future by implementing a cradle to grave nuclear policy.  I'd want them to say

* This is where are we going to get our nuclear fuels from.
* This is how will we burn them and what technologies we'll back
* This is how will we take care of the plants end-of-life and decommissioning
* And this is where shall build a secure central repository to sequester our nuclear waste safely.

Anything short of this and we'll her years of ""the nuclear legacy we inherited from our predecessors"" and nothing will ever be done by them because it would be seen as backing a none-""green"" project.  To them, Green is literally what they believe in - biofuels are good because leaves are green, wind is good because they can be put in green fields, solar is good because it's like artificial photosynthesis and chloroplasts are green.

I'm not sure this sort of comedy does any societal harm, and if it does, it can't be unique to this particular type of humour (if you can call it that). If we abstract this away from a gender argument, the point is a certain kind of humour is disrespectful to a certain kind of person. Your argument seems to be that a joke at a group of people's expense is going to lead to a negative change of behaviour by the rest of society towards that group of people, or even just reinforce those beliefs in people who already hold those beliefs. 

But the majority of comedy is jokes at the expense of a stereotype, be it gender, race, hair colour, IQ or similar, so arguably the majority of comedy should also be discouraged.

As I said, I don't like this guy, but the problem here isn't the character, or the humour or type of joke. The problems are the people who watch it, take it seriously, and think they should go out and replicate the behaviour. 
I don't think those individuals are in the majority though, but neither of us have any evidence regarding the proportion of people who watch this and go out and replicate the behaviour.

Bottom line: the comedy, the character and the joke are not the *real* issue, merely a symptom of a bigger issue. This particular kind of comedy is like alcohol: it's possible to responsibly enjoy it, but some abuse it, but is the irresponsibility of the few justification for ruining it for everyone?

Granted the figures are from 2010 - (I don't know if / how those figures have shifted) but if we look at them we have some rather shocking numbers: 

* In Egypt and Jordan, 84/86% of Muslims asked *support killing anyone who leaves the Muslim religion*. 

* In Pakistan, 82% of Muslims asked are in favour of whipping / cutting off people's hands for theft or robbery. 

* In Egypt and Pakistan, 82% of Muslims asked support stoning people who commit adultery. 

According to Wiki, in 2010 Egypt was 94.7% Muslim. Pakistan was 95-97%. Jordan was around 92% (figures are rough - but can't be far out?) 

Are these figures manipulated or mistaken? Because I find them pretty terrifying if true TBH. That means an overwhelming majority support some *awful* barbaric practices.

Are we racist for looking at the figures?

And well... what can I say... let me start with positives I guess.

Missy was just brilliant during this episode, l was really impressed with her performance and crazyness and I liked her plan.

I also liked Claras bluff to be the Doctor, also pretty impressive. And I really love how the Doctor was made president of earth, though he bragging about him in front of Missy was kind of weird since the Doctor never intended to become the leader of earth and the Master also became the rule of earth without much effort last time around. 

As for negatives... well I wouldn't really call it negative, but I SO did call how ""love"" will win the episode and how the conversation of ninjutsu will take effect. Like I'm serious, you can go back to last episodes discussion and read my predictions there.

Though I was wrong about love being used as an emotion, but at the end it was the key to victory after all. And with every cyberman on screen their danger levels decreased.

Love being a ""promise"" was kind of a weird use, but at least it's somewhat creative and not as cheesy as I feared it would be. 

Having Danny become the ""leader"" of a new breed of cybermen was also an interesting idea, too bad they literally blew it though...

Though the only real thing that disappointed me was the Doctors reaction to being given the army by Missy... I was SO hoping he would accept and was SO disappointed when he refused, which was very predictable though... I would've loved to see the Doctor use that army somehow and maybe travel with Missy from now on, just think of the potential!

Also weren't we promised a ""darker"" Doctor? Outside of being a bit rude and having a dark sense of humor I don't see him doing many dark things... but this was also something I kind of predicted before the season started, that it won't live up to the promises.

That said, I don't think it really need be massively complex, and can be boiled down to about 7 points, only a couple of which would have taken much work:  

**1 Start the nethersphere collecting.**  
 Although the Doctor suggests that it had been collecting all humans ever since the idea of the Afterlife had been around, I think it more probably that it had been hopping around through human history (including future history) and taking random people – maybe a large number of random people here and there – this would allow for those occasions when (such as Torchwood episode 1) where it is suggested that other things (or nothing) happen to the dead in the Whoniverse. It is possible that the Nethersphere has been following the Doctor around – at least part of the time, so then we’d need to consider that the Doctor might have noticed it and found it beforehand – perhaps Missy had some other plans in place in that eventually. Maybe she was even expecting him to and killing Danny to get Clara to point him in the right direction only happened because he hadn’t before that and she was getting bored.

We have had other examples of the Doctor being tracked or followed without knowing in the past, I’m pretty sure, it’s not too unlikely.

Since Missy seems to be personally welcoming half-face to an open and otherwise empty seeming place in Deep Breath, it would seem to suggest that she had only just started this plan then, so to have collected billions between that and the crowded looking place that we see in DiH, it would seem that the nethersphere has been operating independently of the Doctor’s trips though (or else he’s had a LOT of very deadly offscreen adventures between the two).

Either way, other than popping in here and there to see how things were going – perhaps only when the Nethersphere and the Doctor’s timelines overlapped and there was a possibility that he would discover it, and thus initiate phase two of the plan, I don’t suppose that Missy had much involvement with the collecting for almost all of the time. 

One question that does spring to mind, if this time period was when Missy had actually planned things to come to the Doctor’s attention, is why was she collecting the future dead? What bodies would they have been able to return too?

Incidentally I rather think that Missy might have already had the Matrix slice anyway and was just repurposing it – she might have stolen it store her biodata as far back as *The Deadly Assassin* IMHO.

**2. Acquiring the appropriate cyber-technology.**  
 I think that this was probably the trigger for Missy to start this scheme. Either she came up with the plan and then went and gained control of the cyber gear, or – and I think more likely – acquired the tech as part of some other unrelated scheme and then came up with the plan, inspired by the materials at hand.

**3. Getting Clara and the Doctor together.**  
 Perhaps she just happened to find a suitably plucky, rather abrasive and controlling human whilst on Earth going about some other scheme and set her up with him then, or perhaps she had noticed one or more Clara splinters elsewhere in the Doctor’s timeline – possibly killing them him/herself at various points, and so tracked the original down to work on. Maybe Clara wasn’t the first that she had tried, but was simply the first that worked successfully. The impossible girl would inevitably have been the first one that he successfully got together with the Doctor anywhere around that time in his existance.

**4. Preparing the cyber-Brig.**  
 Ensuring that he retained his emotions, giving him a teleporter rather than a gun, and making sure that he was near her thoughout (near the plane and the cemetery) as a fallback, knowing that he was the most likely to shoot if/when things went pearshaped. This was simply a form of ironic revenge for their past encounters once the Brigadier had “become available”, I’d imagine.

**5. Setting up W3.**  
Perhaps one of several equivalent companies at likely points in Human history that the Doctor might have noticed, so initiating phase two of the plan. This probably required the most attention of any of the plan, and was quite possibly primarily handled by Dr Skarosa, Dr Chang and equivalents, either in on the true nature of the project, or just hypnotised. Or perhaps this - W3 in the early 21st centurty - was the only one. She set this up to attract his attention when he hadn't noticed otherwise, and perhaps he still didn't notice, which is why she had to go to the next point... 

**6. Getting Danny killed.**  
 Having got an attractive young woman involved with the Doctor, it is not unreasonable to expect that she would get into a relationship at some point before too long. Danny just happened to be in the wrong time and place. Missy possibly did some work behind the scenes to push them in the right direction, (did she meet with him, hypnotise him, and get him to go on that first date eventually, after so much reluctance - was that the “family business” that he, an orphan, spoke about: the cover story that Missy had placed in his memory?). But maybe she just waited until it happened anyway. And then, once they were committed enough, she killed him.

**7. Calling UNIT in.**  
Once it was clear that Doctor would *finally* arrive, so that they could all have some fun together.

Not saying either are great and the other is world class but the concept remains the same. We've had players boast well past Sanchez' numbers when we were shit and as soon as our team's quality went up they had to be sold as well and replaced because their real weaknesses surfaced. Why do you think Oscar still plays for us and Mata doesn't? A statistition would have kept Mata everytime. 


If you gave Sanchez and Hazard to Mourinho he'd pick Hazard, even ignoring the future and what it holds. He makes the entire team better. If you gave Sanchez and Hazard to Wenger he'd sign Kylian Hazard because he's a young kid who speaks French, just so happened that the Arsenal ownership wanted Sanchez badly.


As long as Sanchez is Arsenal's best player their squad will be as shit as it is now. He is their bar for them and Hazard isn't even our bar. Our players all take turns to set it higher and higher. 



So forget about these comparisons. If they think he's better than Hazard then good on them, they have every right to think so, afterall they have a habit of building a player up and then shitting on and booing them (Wilshere,Ramsey, Ozil recently) when the rest of their squad slightly improves and they realize the player wasn't as good as they thought. This is as good as it gets for them ""Our Sanchez is better than your Hazard"", in all honestly only 1 of their player would make our starting lineup for the right wing and if he still plays one dimensional he'll be subbed off too. Our bench players would start for them. Cech, Schurrle, Willian, Ramires even our inexperienced CB is a better defender than their ""best premiership duo"".



Laughing at them and taking in their misery is the right thing to do. All these stats as thry are fighting for another trophy that doesn't exist.

The actual lack or armistice and possible occupation of Germany by other nations would actually increase the nationalistic approach in Germany. We can see it these days in countries like Iraq and Afghanistan. Also, the Hitler was a person so ....... (I'm lacking words here), that he would in any case find a reason to start what he then started. The further truth is that plenty of Germans actually ignored Hitler as they were focused on their own lives (including partying etc) as not everybody there was poor.

What Farage says is additionally so idiotic because you simply can't read what the guy really has in mind. Just very recently he was advocating (and probably still is) against ANY military involvement of Britain.... yet, he just said he preferred more victims (including British - probably in majority) to be lost during I WW. At the same time, he forgets about the after II WW, when half of Europe was basically given to Stalin, with further victims, oppression etc which resulted in a fact that Eastern Europe migrates to Western, even so many years later after Stalin's death.

One of the reasons Hitler rose in the first place was because the poverty of interwar Germany was seen as the fault of outside forces (IE: due to the armistice and, according to Hitler, ""The Jews""), so surely that happening explicitly and to a bigger degree would cause bigger problems further on?

There's another way this could have gone is that Germany could have been split up (Germany was a young country which before hand had been separate states).

And I give to cancer charities. I don't agree with everything the money goes to, but that's not really why I donate. Do you not see the parallel?

&gt;It is the way the symbol of the poppy is used and the associations of political meaning that I perceive it to have accumulated in recent years that make me uncomfortable with wearing the symbol.

And I don't like the way smokers cost the NHS. So is it appropriate or acceptable to use a cancer charity to make my point? Or would it be suggested that to do so was inappropriate? I mean, they might be funded by Glaxo-Smithkline, and we don't like them (etc.).

&gt;The mere fact that some public figures are being criticised for not wearing a political symbol is disturbing.

It's not a political symbol.

&gt;he way you phrase it as ""get out of"" as though buying a poppy is everyone's moral or political duty is indicative of that troubling trend.

That's because it's not political. You're *making* it political, using the example of someone else doing the same to justify it.

* Only licensed points of sale will be allowed to sell cannabis products and operate in a similar manner to pharmacies.  Point of sale will be based on retail outlets per capita in each postcode (as pharmacies currently operate).
* A limit to the amount purchased per transaction will be used to prevent selling on (those wishing to have more will either have to retail tour or stockpile).""


This is basically the US model and so far has been working.  You can buy safe, quality cannabis which has come from a US source freely in certain states.  Because of this, South American cannabis production has dropped because they can't compete. South American farmers can now get more profit from growing cereal crops than cannabis crops, and the major loser here is the drug cartels in the middle. 

If the Greens want to have a serious discussion about drug regulation, than what they've published as **their policy** is out of date.  They claim on their site it was updated in 2006.  That may as well be the 1970's with the amount of change in the illegal drug landscape over the past 8 years with US and Netherlands changing their stances and drugs from Afgan changing so much.  

I'm sure that if they *really* had the backing like the big three have, then their policies should be up to date.  If a basic drug policy is this sloppy, then what's it going to say about their policy on a Trident replacement, HS2, EU integration, UN commitments, armed services support and so on?

Their flagship policy of ""be more green"" is empty if they have nothing else.  It's sad that when I look at their core values, I totally agree with them.  But I can not see for the life of me anything behind it to move towards attaining their core values.


Every grant application I've ever been involved in has always been SMART targeted to give a logical progression from problem to solution to give the funding body the confidence that their investment will go through to the end point.  The Green's have clear advantage on that there is a problem - climate change, immigration, drug policy, social issue - but no where do I see ""this is how we will address these problems, and this is how we will know if we've met them.""  The Tories and Labour can be just as bad, but at least more of their policies have content behind them.

Today I was not feeling comfortable by the situation manufactured around me. A technology company showed up today, they have come up with a device that calculates the rotationary movement of the sun, earth, space and time. This perplexed me as to why you need a device like this in the first place. Surely it is more efficient to have one device to perform the maximum number of features and the humans have already discovered stoneage ""smartphone"" ('smartphone:phone' : ref log 46347482.9) technology. Why would humans need to keep track of space and time in the first place? They can only travel as fast as I can without aids. This perplexes me.


The biggest abnormality was what it all had to do with the tactical ball kicking game ('football : not soccer' : ref log 375869) I am programmed to play as a mean to blend in. Subject- John Obi Mikel tried to explain the function ""sponsorship"" to me, but he was unsuccessful in his distribution of knowledge.



 I was given a challenge to out manoeuvre the ball compared to my human fellow 'friends' (ref log 34). I tried doing my worst and it still ended up being better than them all. As for protecting my cover, it was just enough although subject-Courtois shows the curiosity of a giraffe. Fear he might be onto me so monitoring him closely.

Emotionally these two episodes were a spectacle especially with the Danny story though that did not appeal to all. Missy was a great addition to the series and the acting of all involved was great leaving us with an ending reminiscent of the RTD era. 
2. Listen - I absolutely loved this episode as it did not need to have a visible monster to appeal to us. Moffat has given us the Silence and the Weeping Angels but in my opinion this 'monster' trumped them all as none of us can beat something that may not even exist.
3. Flatline - The writing in this episode was spectacular building on a concept that I am truly surprised has not appeared before. Clara was great as the Doctor and it shed light on the fact that the Doctor is not a good man as was a common theme throughout the series. 
4. Mummy on the Orient Express - Mathieson please come back, such a great writer who truly gets the Doctor and more importantly the current Doctor. I do wish that some of the background characters such as the other scientists actually did something though.
5. Deep Breath - Though I was sceptical at first due to the fact that it was slower than the usual episode there were still moments of gold. The last 20 minutes were brilliant and Capaldi was great throughout. There were however a few unnecessary parts such as the dinosaur but that was passable.
6. Time Heist - I enjoyed it. Psi gave a speech which I would usually expect from The Doctor which in a way emphasised the fact that we now had a completely new Doctor. Overall, I think I enjoyed Psi and Sabre much more than any other ally of the week presented to us throughout this series. 
7. The Caretaker - This episode was fun and gave us Danny and the Doctor's first meeting which went pretty much how I expected it to. I always enjoy it when the Doctor attempts to be human and this episode did not disappoint in that regard.
8. Into the Dalek - Decent episode but let's be honest there didn't even need to be any Daleks in this episode. It could of been done with any other villain or could of just happened inside a building. That said I do like the Daleks actually being dangerous again
9. Robot of Sherwood - This episode symbolised last true light episode before we were hit with the darkness which became so prevalent in the series. I didn't enjoy as much as other episodes but it was fun and the arguments between Robin and the Doctor were pretty good. However, the golden arrow kind of ruined the extent of the threat as has been done in the past with the Sonic Screwdriver.
10. In the Forest of the Night - Nothing happened and to be honest nothing needed to happen. The last scene where we see the girls sister though referenced seemed out of place as the audience felt no connection to her. I liked the Doctor saying Earth was his planet but otherwise there wasn't much to draw from it. Why weren't there loads of people in London?
11. Kill the Moon - Once again nothing really needed to happen and that science wasn't great at all was it? The worst thing for me was the hype this episode got as I was really looking forward to it. 

I enjoyed most episodes this series and the acting was brilliant. It seemed at times that we still had episodes that would of been better suited to Smith so hopefully next series we get a few more episodes that reflect Capaldi's Doctor.",0,1415798945,null,0,false,0,cm0bxwx,t3_2m1eqs,t1_cm0bxwx,t3_2m1eqs,null,1426063876,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

12. In the Forest of the Night

MotOE and Flatline are two stories which just… fit perfectly with me. Original, frightening monsters with easily identifiable traits (66 seconds, exists in 2D), a fair share of emotional points and character development, mostly towards Clara, and near-perfect supporting cast. Orient Express stands out, though, for how gripping each 66 second sequence was, and a fitting resolution that starts to see 12 take a different stance to soldiers.

Dark Water splits the both of them as it is the best first episode of a two-parter I have ever seen since…Human Nature or Empty Child. I decided to keep it split from Death in Heaven as you said episodes, not stories, and Dark Water had all the elements of Flatline and Mummy, with Danny's shocking death and his experience in the Nethersphere, and especially how Seb manipulates him to delete his emotions (almost), really place this episode high up. Death in Heaven is lower just because it was not a good follow up to everything in Dark Water, yet is ranked high thanks to Missy and Osgood, and the scene of Osgood's death was just jaw-dropping.

Time Heist ranks high because, for some reason, it was really, really likeable. Not a massive episode, just a regular adventure, but one that I found no faults in. The Teller is also up there in the scariest monsters list. Listen is next, because, as jaw-dropping as it was, it's just the quality of the other episodes push it down, though I may be a bit harsh putting it below Time Heist, especially with the grand reveal at the end. Maybe it's the scene with young Rupert. Just didn't see why they had to include all of that in.

Into the Dalek was great on concept alone. Who has ever gone inside one of those things?! Have we ever seen a Dalek that hates…Daleks? No we haven't and that makes a good Dalek story. Like Listen, though, there are other, really terrific episodes that make it where it is. Similar to Deep Breath, but there is a reason why I didn't rank it that high: the Paternoster gang. They stayed the same. Humorous,yes. Introducing Missy-tique (okay bad pun), it did so greatly. BLOODY BRILLIANT ACTING FROM JENNA COLEMAN? You have it right here. Anything else, though? Not really, no.

Robots of Sherwood is the first dislikable episode for me, if only for the ending, generic robot villain of the week and not much season-building wise, but Capaldi's performance, especially the chemistry between him and Robin Hood, is what makes this the best of the worst. Kill The Moon had that bugger called Courtney, unrealistic shit about on or off your lights to save the moon, and absolutely no link between the deathly cool spider-thingys and the moon-is-a-frickin-egg theory. Apart from that, it was quite the alright adventure, but as those points are quite major in this story, it ranks near the bottom, could've been worse had that final scene between Clara and the Doctor not taken place.

The Caretaker was…boring. Plain boring. You could have had a regeneration at the end of that episode, but I was just sitting here thinking 'I have something else better to do today.' The robot, Pink and Twelve scenes and Missy's appearance were probably the only redeeming factors in this one that I could find. Apart from that, this episode was forgettable. I don't have a deep critique of it, but when you can't be bothered to even try to do one, what's the point?

And I'd rather forget the Forest episode. Had it spoiled to me as a reveal that everything that happened was a dream. Watched it, ended up being a real nightmare. And don't get me started on Maebh's sister coming back. Awful episode, probably worse than, if not definitely worse than Fear Her.

**TL;DR Mathieson episodes were amazing, Finale Part 2 couldn't match Finale Part 1, amazing episodes were outclassed by fantastic episodes, want In the Forest of the Night to die in a fire (or solar flare)(which it technically did)(but still won't burn the memory from my mind)**

This was a fantastic season, probably the best of the revival since series 1.

The tech of today and tomorrow represents a considerable leap. Instead of computers that carry out simple tasks, there will be computers that'll do things for us.

I was lucky enough to go to Mallorca for a week to do the Astronomy / Planetary Science residential week, as well as geology-based ones in Durham and Scotland.  However, I missed one of the 3rd year residentials as they were being phased out during my degree.

They're now bringing the option to travel to these places back, but for less time than a week (which you really need to understand all the material/techniques), and / or on a less official capacity for some of the trips (e.g. Mallorca one is [run by a private company outside OU](http://www.astronomytuition.co.uk/mallorca.html) and doesn't count towards degree points).

Every tutor I've spoken to was against the idea, but it's all about cost-saving, they are trimming things down a lot, taking away a lot of the modules and some of the degrees, including mine!  Meaning I had to finish it a bit quicker than I would have liked and had to do some third year modules before second year ones in order to fit them all in.  

However, even considering all of that, I found it the best way to learn (tried brick uni and didn't like it).  The material is well written, and all the tutors I've had (apart from one!) have been happy to help with any problems / confusion.

I doubt they are intentionally slowing your internet down in order to upsell you fibre, since I generally attribute problems to incompetence rather than malice.

The question is, how far are you from your telephone exchange? The length of the copper cable run between you and the exchange is the primary factor in your ADSL speed. If it's long (more than about half a mile), then switching ISPs won't make much difference, but switching to fibre will.

50 years ago we didn't even have computers, now they are integral to every part of western society.

Change is becoming part of the DNA of the young generations. The populace (on the whole) seems to be keeping up with the rate of innovations in technology.

I don't think that a lack of political will is going to stop the restructuring of society that is required in the next 50 years.

Which at the moment is an incredibly poor one. It is a very dangerous reaction from him, on a business level its quite stupid.

Having gone to a few games I have often wondered if Tottenham havent ""sold out"".  Catered to the rich and entitled by increasing the ticket prices, effectively ruining the great atmosphere that once was at the Lane.

His entire popularity is based on his image as the man unafraid to speak his mind and challenge the accepted 'political narrative'. This most recent statement of his fits that pattern perfectly.

While I'm sure he'll defend that statement now, I do think he settled on that opinion because of the controversy it would cause. It's an opinion that you *could* argue in favour for, even if poorly, simply because you can inflate the importance of the particular 'factor' you've elected to focus on.

Anyone that's a 'historical enthusiast' wouldn't contribute Hitler's entire rise to power because one particular bloke stood next to him in the beer hall putsch, especially considering said figure of *towering importance* came dead last in the Presidential Elections 2 years after said putsch. He was *nowhere near* the 'make or break' figure Farage is claiming him to be.

Even a brief look into the validity of Farage's claim sees it fall apart before you: he said it because it's controversial, which is his race horse when it comes to soundbites, and it appeals to the 'glory days' mentality his party has. 

The chances that he arrived at a conclusion that fits his exact political stereotype through completely impartial study of events strike me as forlorn, especially a position that's not touted by any mainstream historical opinion.

yes he was on newsnight, but only to apologize, not further carry on with his comedy as dapper laughs. Please don't take me so literally when that obviously doesn't count in the context of him being a comedian trying to continue a career in tv.


I can't speak tv ratings, because I know fuck all about them. however a uk tour and near 2 mil fans on the fb looks pretty healthy to me. maybe he'll be on I'm a celeb or big brother, but that again isn't exactly what he's trying to do with his career I'd assume.


no one has accused him to the police, no, but the initial article that got the ball rolling called him a rapists almanac and it's been said over and over that he encourages sexist behaviour as well as rape culture which therefore means to say he encourages sexual harassment, assault and rape itself. you don't have to report that to the police to damage somebodies rep.


he wouldn't be guilty of being unfunny because he had a full uk tour and just under 2 mil fans. I think that objectively meant a good amount of people found him pretty funny whether you like him or not.



yes, his jokes are crude. the problem some people have is that the complainants are getting to dictate to other people what is and isn't allowed to be seen as funny. the complainants have actively done things which have silenced and entertainer who is well recieved by people who like his brand of comedy.



yes you're allowed to stand up as a society, but looking at the numbers on record, dapper's fb followers alone shits upon the 60k who signed the petition and the 29 who complained to itv, yet he's still had his show axed because of the complainants, not quite sure how that's democratic. if anything it's itv saving themselves from a bad rep (which they are allowed to do btw).

Did you not read this bit?

""DU405 Cannabis would be removed from the 1971 Misuse of drugs act. The possession, trade and cultivation of cannabis would be immediately decriminalised, roughly following the Dutch model. The trade in Cannabis would be the subject of a Royal Commission (see below), with a view to establishing a fully legalised, controlled and regulated trade. Small-scale possession of drugs for personal use would be decriminalised. The starting point would be advice to policing authorities to caution rather than prosecute for offences of drug possession for personal use and to refer offenders to the health-care services (see DU411). Subsequently, regulations would be brought forward removing criminal sanctions for simple possession of controlled drugs for personal use. The recommended sentences for small-scale supply would be non-custodial options. The possession of pipes made for the use in connection with smoking of opium would no longer be a criminal offence. A Royal Commission or similar body would be established to review currently controlled drug classifications, within a legalised environment of drug use. This commission would, after wide consultation, consider and recommend frameworks of social, economic and health conditions for drug use and supply.""

Leigh Francis grew up on a council estate and his dad made car radiators, so it's fair to say at one point in his life he was working class. He's also old enough that we can use a fairly traditional definition of working class - like I said, his dad worked in a factory or workshop. What working people do is shifting to services - people who work in a shop or supermarket are increasingly the new working class. Ironically knowing a trade is getting people to a new level of income attainment as professionalism on building sites and lack of skills across society mean that being a scaffolder is in demand and pays quite well (I think it's something like 50K a year, although you have the ever present risk of injury).

But I would say that background has a rather profound effect on you. I would identify as middle-class given my background, but my dad was unemployed for much of the early 90s and I grew up in the inner city, so I saw a lot of people who wanted for better, and very, very occasionally had it myself - I'll never forget those moments when my parents legitimately couldn't afford things.

* Assisted fans in the nonsensical court cases regarding 'the Y word' and enabled them to get vital legal support. 

There's tons more and I'm sure she'll be happy to inform you if you kindly ask in an email or twitter. 

Also Neil has good points, that frankly aren't all ""knee jerk"". The ticket rising to that extreme is deplorable in regards to the level we're at and he also mentions that a repair of the relationship from board level to fans would be a start rather than getting them to leave.  

The club don't treat us as humans, we're just client reference numbers to them and not much else. Maybe you're not able to get to White Hart Lane often and that's completely understandable.

My personal opinion is that something legalised, taxed and controlled correctly helps to ensure kids cannot get their hands on it, some money goes towards treating the minority of people who will abuse the drug, we can treat those people medically as well instead of paying even more to lock them up. 
Also I have pretty liberal political views, if my drug use does not physically harm anyone around me then why should someone stop me from using it.

I think you're right about the shift in how the bulk of what we'd call the working class are moving away from physical labour and factory work, and into retail and service industries. It raises critical questions of the role of automation and technology in how society is structured. We don't have to cast our gaze too far back into the past to see a large proportion of working class people employed in agriculture, yet today I imagine it makes up less than a few percent of the work force, and the majority of farmers are definitely not working class I imagine. Why pay for hundreds, or thousands of people to work in your fields when a combine harvester can do the job far more efficiently. 

I think the unstoppable (continued) rise of automation will be both one of the most positive and challenging aspects of change we will have to face over the coming years. It is the logical inevitability within a Western-capitalist society. 

There definitely is merit to the idea of a disconnect between understanding poverty on an intellectual level, and understanding it through lived experience. I feel as if I am somewhat currently straddling the line between those two poles, being a student who doesn't really have a whole lot of money has provided brief glimpses into what it's like to be poor. At the same time however, I have the incredible good fortune of coming from a rigorously middle-class background, so despite not having any significant income myself, I know there is that safety net behind me, sheltering me from the gritty reality of absolute poverty.

Controversy is at the heart of comedy, the two go hand in hand. Everyone has their limit to what they find funny and anything beyond that they generally consider ""too offensive."" This notion is ridiculous, as this makes you no different to the people who used to complain about swear-words on television, or comedians who slam religion. Dapper Laugh's show is most obviously a comedy show, and therefore one goes into it knowing that he will purposefully say ridiculous things not to be seriously. Honestly do you really think people will watch his show, see him joke about rape and go ""I feel like raping someone tomorrow."" He is not telling people to go out there and rape, he is making highly offensive and unpleasant remarks self consciously knowing they are sick and twisted, which is the part people find funny.

One of the downsides of free speech is that you willl hear things that you find distateful or disagree with, but without this opinions can't be developed or changed. Someone like Dapper Laughs should be slammed on twitter and ridiculed by other comedians, but to take further action is highly unecessary.

either, sures theres probably a correlation but again it's like /r/jailbait.
Creepy doesn't mean objectively morally wrong or illegal. It's a fine line, but
this definitely seems to come down on the creepy side rather than evil.


It's perfectly justifiable to feel violated and victimised. It's also
completely useless and preventable. There is a massive education gap. People
are really really stupid about the services they use online and how they use
them. They don't understand that it's not the responsibility of the rest of the
world to do things as they'd like them. Hell it's not even that way in law, its
up to the defendant to prove their copyright or trademark is violated, if you
don't go out and defend it you lose you right to it.

You shouldn't be expecting each and every bad thing to happen. You should
however be coming from the default position that the internet is hostile and
anything you put on it _will_ be taken and used by some immoral or hostile 
actor for their own benefit. If you're working from any other assumption then
you're doing it wrong. Again this is an education issue.

I have sympathy for the people who had their photos used, clearly noone has
educated them sufficiently about how the internet works.

I don't follow. You can attend someone's funeral without having to decide first if they're 'worthy'.

Sometimes. But does that change the general view of everyone because of a company or person you don't like?

&gt;When an arms company sponsors a ""poppy ball"" it is political.

For them. Not for everyone else (it's ultimately insulting to make that assertion on other people's behalf)

So...if you make a statement saying it's politicised *by all*, and I disagree, I'm the one making it political?

&gt; the language around the issue is framed in such a way as to suggest that not wearing a poppy is a ""refusal"" to wear it

Because you're using something that's not political to make a political statement. You can't complain that MP's do it and then change the rules when you're doing the same.

&gt;You haven't questioned me at all.

In which case, I guess none of these posts actually exist.

No, they have charity drives all the time - do I not donate to them if I want to make a statement about not liking Big Pharma who also sponsor them?

false,Kitchner,cnty-wales,Wales,"It's worth noting that Portugal didn't legalise drugs too, it decriminalised it, which is very different.

It's still illegal to be caught with drugs in Portugal, the difference is for certain drugs in small amounts it won't lead to a criminal record. So if a Police Officer pulls you over and you have drugs on you, they could take them off you, they just wont arrest you on criminal charges.

Portugal had a huge HIV problem (like massively so for the western world) and decriminalising drugs use allowed them to give out clean syringes etc to reduce HIV transmission, which did work very well.

I feel then applying the logic to Portugal's decriminalisation of drugs to the UK's (or any other country) isn't a good idea as the situation is very different. We have plenty of charities etc that anonymously let addicts get clean equipment and syringes for example.

Please don't take this the wrong way, but the arguments you put forward are what I see all the time on Reddit, and they don't really make sense. I appreciate you're being civil though and actually putting forward points in a way that you sound open minded. So let me show you what I mean:

&gt;  My personal opinion is that something legalised, taxed and controlled correctly helps to ensure kids cannot get their hands on it, some money goes towards treating the minority of people who will abuse the drug, we can treat those people medically as well instead of paying even more to lock them up.

Firstly, let me say I'm totally a fan of rehabilitation rather than retaliation when it comes to the legal system, I think our prison system doesn't work and our justice system criminalises minor criminals (from petty drugs use to getting caught in pub fights etc). I would much rather see money spent of rehabilitating criminals of all sorts rather than building more prison space. 

However, I have to take issue with the idea that you can legalise and control drugs to restrict who has access. My reasoning for this is alcohol and tobacco already find their way into the hands of under age kids. 

Usually if you point something like that out it takes some mental and verbal/written gymnastics to make an argument like ""Alcohol is legal and cigarettes are legal and they do more harm, so why not weed?"" when confronted with the point that a lot of people drink and smoke to excess, costing the country millions every year. 

I drank under age, my friends drank and smoked under age (and smoked drugs). Many parents knew their children smoked and drank but did nothing about it, because it was a social norm. The same WILL happen with drugs. The idea that they would somehow be controlled better than every other substance that is restricted AND still be cheap and hassle free enough to out muscle the black market is illogical. 

&gt;I have pretty liberal political views, if my drug use does not physically harm anyone around me then why should someone stop me from using it. At the very least legalise consumption and possession of small amounts in private property and allow people to grow a plant if they want just ban selling it.

I disagree with it but I can't really argue with it as it's your opinion. I mean I could debate this ideology with you but it wouldn't be a debate of facts it would be of philosophy and other such topics. 

I respect someone who can basically justify a stance like that even if I disagree with it, but a lot of people on Reddit put forward drugs legalisation as it's an objective fact it would benefit the country.

&gt; Be careful with any antioxidant in a jar
 
 
Yeah.. I would love my mom to move on to something else, but the both of us find the cream very hydrating. I use it as a sleeping pack when I'm feeling a bit dry and wake up with ""bouncy"" skin (even though I sleep on moisture-sucking cotton sheets). Anyway, I don't know how willing she'll be to move to something else since she likes to not use a tonne of different products, has sensitive skin, and doesn't want to pay an exorbitant amount for stuff. Plus there's no way she'll DIY. Sigh... that lady! Love her, but boy is she stubborn.  
    
(Replying to all your comments in this)  
  
&gt; However if you are using an AHA and your tretinoin gel I would be careful on sunny days or when spending time by windows (UV can penetrate glass) or if it snows. Research suggests use of some polyphenol antioxidants and of vitamin C can boost the efficacy of sunscreen - these have photoprotective properties.
  
Yeah, I'm going to lay off the AHA and retin-a for a bit, and just stick to a BHA for now since I feel like I can see my face darkening a bit. I have some promising sunscreens on the way, and I'm hoping they're easy to reapply in public / the office (sink in easily, no whitecast). I tend to opt for SPF 50 PA++++ since I tan easily, but I'm now wondering if I should use PA+++ as my reapplication sunscreen since those sink in fast and don't leave a whitecast.

Average wages more than tripled during the industrial revolution. 

Contrast that to what is happening today. There are very few technologies which are creating large numbers of new jobs, wages are stagnating, there are many technologies which are reducing the number of workers required, and most importantly, the population is still increasing. 

Its important to remember that the majority of developments over the last 200 years have not been about automation, but rather mechanisation. You can replace a room full of typewriters with computers, but you still need one person working on each of them. mechanisation creates jobs, as it increases the scale at which you can work.

Automation is all about replacing human workers, and there has been a huge push towards this in more recent times.

In order to keep employment levels high, new technological advancements must be able to create jobs in greater numbers than they make old ones obsolete. The recent push towards automation in all industries makes it very unlikely that this will happen.

You understand that in order for creative *stuff* to be successful it needs to be popular right? So how can an economy, based on the popularity of certain *stuff*; be successful? If every single person in that economy is creating *stuff*, but only a fraction of that *stuff* is becoming popular; how are the people who arent creating popular *stuff* going to survive?

Creativity isnt about logic or competition of prices/efficiency/customer services, its about how much you personally like something, regardless of anything measurable.

&gt; But still pop lyrics, which are the simplest things ever, require teams of lyricists, as no computer can generate them.

Except that computers can generate lyrics, i dont really understand why you think that a computer wouldnt be able to generate lyrics. If anything the mathematics of a song are much more complex than lyrics.

[&gt; Automated lyric creating software may take forms such as:
Selecting words according to their rhythm
The Tra-la-Lyrics system produces song lyrics, in Portuguese, for a given melody. This not only involves matching each word syllable with a note in the melody, but also matching the word's stress with the strong beats of the melody.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music_automation#Lyric_composition)

Personally, I think the Doctor is terrible at regeneration. My head canon is that most other time lords have a much easier time of it, and more conscious control over the outcome. But the Doctor (and the Master) tend to regenerate under traumatic circumstances, which probably makes it hard to concentrate.

If there is a level of conscious/subconscious control, that opens all kinds of subtext for the Mistress's regeneration.

false,CrashingAnalyst,eng-gloucestershire,Cheltenham,"&gt; Ok, now that we're in court and a woman is accusing you of rape because she was drunk. Please prove to the court the woman wasn't classified as drunk after a single glass of wine.

The prosecutor would need to prove she was drunk and unable to give consent in the first place, which would be determined by a rape kit which tests BAC. BAC after a single glass of wine will probably be around 0.020%, which would not be deemed as too drunk to consent.

In the absence of a rape kit, it would be more difficult for the prosecutor to prove a case. They might ask witnesses if they'd seen her drinking a lot of alcohol and/or appeared intoxicated, but that by itself could not be enough to convict.

I could add weight to my defense simply by saying she seemed lucid and we were talking and there was no impression that she was unable to give consent.

&gt; This is why the issue is so messed up. You cannot define when a person is too drunk to consent. The only reason we have a definition for drink driving is that it's the amount of alcohol consumed that increases mental reaction time to slam the brakes on.

In the UK we often use case law rather than de jure standards from on high. Ultimately arbitrary lines don't really help because it depends on more than just the blood alcohol content or how much she or he'd had to drink. The prosecution *must prove* that the victim was *unable* to give consent. So they have to prove they were black-out drunk, or near enough not lucid / conscious. The traditional 'test' was, if the victim had lost consciousness at any point, they were too drunk. Giving consent under bad judgement because you're drunk still counts as consent in the UK.

I know it's a massive fear that false rape convictions occur all the time, but they genuinely are rare. If you're ever charged or arrested on suspicion of rape, chances are the case will be thrown out because there won't be enough evidence. As long as you don't confess - rape cases have a disproportionate number of confessions (probably because non-confessors don't get convicted) - you've a very slim chance of ending up behind bars.",0,1415807361,null,0,false,0,cm0ff8k,t3_2m2f8t,t1_cm0ff8k,t1_cm0e670,null,1426062236,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

I feel that if this was something Dapper had said, he'd have been utterly lambasted for it. But because it was a posh boy with possibly different delivery then it was just ""Jimmy Carr being shocking again"".

I dont think Dapper Laughs is funny, but a lot of the stuff thats being held up as proof of misogyny doesn't seem much worse than the sort of offense Jimmy Carr or Frankie Boyle make. Heck, Frankie Boyle talked about Jordans disabled son raping her, but he's considered hilarious.

Im not going to say that this is clear cut classism, its not. But there does seem to be a double standard between typical edgy middle class comedians, and Dapper. 

I think Dapper is perhaps being criticised more for the percieved audience he has than the actual content he creates. Whereas Frankie joking about disabled people raping their mums is funny because its shocking, Dappers stuff is presented by the media as being a guide, or the normal way to approach women and talk about them. And therein lies his downfall, because while it may be that way to a certain group of people, even women. It obviously isnt for a much larger group.

Good point on the HIV and infections issue when applied to this country. 

The only thing I disagree with you about is the kids issue. At the moment a drug dealer will not care if he is selling to a 10 year old or a 50 year old money is money to him. If we were to legalise cannabis for instance I really do think that it would reduce the chance of kids getting it. If there was a black market for alcohol and cigarettes like there is for drugs I think we would see more kids drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes. 
However at the end of the day when it comes to that point we just have to wait and see what happens with places like Washington and Colorado with their youth consumption of drugs. Obviously you cannot say what happens there will happen here but it will provide us with a good example of what could happen. 

I also have to bring up another point and that is culture. The UK has a culture of excess when it comes to drink and drugs. Especially drink. Now I am personally a very moderate drug user I smoke maybe 3 or 4 times a month and maybe a couple time a year will dabble in a little bit of MDMA. A lot of other people will not use drugs in this way and will treat it like alcohol if fully legalised. 
For this reason fully legalising may not work in the UK I do strongly believe that the government should look at decriminalisation and allowing people to grow and consume small amounts of cannabis but not sell, I also think this should apply to other naturally occurring drugs that do not have a high health risk such as mushrooms.

Yeah man it is nice to be able to discuss issues like this without people getting all angry and emotional. I'm not one of those people that think pot is some miracle drug but I do recognise that I am much less likely to cause harm to myself or other than when I am drinking. For that reason I do not really drink anymore, not to get drunk anyway I enjoy a good single malt every now and then.

&gt; To a man in the 1700's a non agricultural based economy would not only have been impossible but it would have been ridiculous and stupid, to him if 80% of the people wre not working in farms there would be nothing for them to do. 

But they could atleast imagine it, a farmer in the 1700's was well aware of the improvements that had been made in the past to the tools he uses and techniques he practices. Crop rotation, horse drawn ploughs, broadcasting, irrigation, iron and bronze tools.

These are all improvements that anybody from the 1700th century could see and knew about. It was obvious that a farmers tools would continue to improve, why would their time period (or even ours) be any different than the time periods before it? You cannot stop technological advancement.

Analogues, anecdotes and quotes make you sound smart but in reality mean nothing.

&gt; Except they can't, there is not a single pop record producer that uses computers to write lyrics, not a single one. Also Tra la la are not lyrics that is melody.

And thats the basis for your entire ""creative based economy"" argument? Absolutely laughable.

&gt; Yes they can, do you have any evidence that they cannot?

You claim to know about this subject but then dont know about any of the evidence which might contradict your view?

&gt; Finally, Cope’s program could divine what made Bach sound like Bach and create music in that style. It could also perform just as well in producing new Mozart compositions and Shakespeare sonnets.

&gt; When Cope played “the game” in front of an audience, asking which pieces were real Bach and which were Emmy-written Bach, most people couldn’t tell the difference. Many were angry; few understood the point of the exercise.

false,Kitchner,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt;The only thing I disagree with you about is the kids issue. At the moment a drug dealer will not care if he is selling to a 10 year old or a 50 year old money is money to him. If we were to legalise cannabis for instance I really do think that it would reduce the chance of kids getting it. If there was a black market for alcohol and cigarettes like there is for drugs I think we would see more kids drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes

Thing is I know a lot of people who take drugs casually, and I can't think of a single one that started before they were 16 (which at the time was the legal age for tobacco). I know of some kids that would have started younger perhaps, but they are the exception rather than the rule.

The fact is at the moment while a drug dealer totally would sell to a ten year old, (most) ten year olds aren't really able to get hold of weed. You say later on you smoke occasionally, but would you let your kid smoke when they were 16? I was given glasses of champagne etc on social occasions when I was under age (though technically legally) because it is seen as socially acceptable.

Right now, for better or for worse, a lot of places it isn't socially acceptable to take drugs. Your employer will likely fire you and many of your non-drug taking friends wont want to be involved. Over time, if it's legal, it's legitimised and it's use increases. People compare it to the prohibition saying you can't ever stop illegal activity. This is true but it also applies to speeding, murder, theft etc. and people don't advocate a ""murder tax"".

&gt;However at the end of the day when it comes to that point we just have to wait and see what happens with places like Washington and Colorado with their youth consumption of drugs. Obviously you cannot say what happens there will happen here but it will provide us with a good example of what could happen.

I agree. They are the only places I'm aware of that have fully legalised the sales of a drug. I think it will be many years before we know the true effect though. Right now we see a big uptick in tax revenue and decrease in crime potentially, but what if it hampers productivity? What if it becomes so normal that kids can easily obtain it and they don't study properly? I don't think it will be anything that dramatic, but we have no idea what the long term effects of legalisation are.

&gt;For this reason fully legalising may not work in the UK I do strongly believe that the government should look at decriminalisation and allowing people to grow and consume small amounts of cannabis but not sell, I also think this should apply to other naturally occurring drugs that do not have a high health risk such as mushrooms.

For me the problem is always about legitimising things that I don't think should be legitimised. As I said I have friends who do drugs, but I've always insisted they don't take cocaine when I'm with them, they don't smoke weed around me etc. I don't shop them to the police because I know they aren't actually criminals, but I also feel comfortable saying ""no"". If someone comes around my house though and they smoke cigarettes, it's extremely rude for me to even ban them from smoking outside in the back garden. I don't want to live in a world where a guy can turn up with drugs and I will be the outcast if I say ""No thanks, do it in the back garden or not at all"". I already hate the smell of weed and every now and again I'll be squished onto the Tube next to someone who stinks of it. I assume most people cover the smell up so it's not obvious now, but if it becomes socially acceptable?

I actually think of myself as quite pragmatic when it comes to drugs, but I also have loftier ambitions then simply legalising everything. Surely we should be able to create a nation or a world where people wont need drugs to relax or have a good time?

If legalisation has a proven track record in the US so we know the long term effects then maybe, I just don't buy any of the arguments in favour right now. ",0,1415809319,null,0,false,0,cm0ggy6,t3_2m04cc,t1_cm0ggy6,t1_cm0fp1g,null,1426061747,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

There is a concept called FFP (Financial Fair Play) which is being implemented ahead of the January transfer window. I suspect this means we won't be able to buy any more players for some time. Alternatively, the league hit the club with a massive bill based on a % of the losses which were sustained. At the last count this was around £50m if I recall. This is all under review at the moment due to the number of clubs which will be impacted (around 50% of Championship teams). 

The other consideration is the parachute payments which the Premier League pay to relegated teams finishes at the end of next season. To Rovers we received £16m for each of the past two seasons, then a further £8m this season and next. Once this income disappears I suspect we will know where we stand. 

The team at the moment has some chance of promotion, but there are a number of other good, if not better teams. We currently have a good squad and are unbeaten in 7, currently sit 5 points from top spot and one point from the 4 play off places.

The idea of offence and controversy in comedy are in my opinion far more nuanced that we often give them credit for. Controversy and offence do not exist as binary entities within comedy, we have to explore *why* certain topics or bits are offensive to some and not to others. I feel you're simplifying this in saying that humour exists on a scale that goes from 'I find this funny' past some tipping point to 'I find this offensive'. 

I also think you're overestimating the ability of his combined viewership to fully understand that it is a comedy show, and ostensibly that he presents himself as a 'character', although this has come under question, given his previously stated position as him operating as an extension of his 'real' self. You and I may fully understand that it is a comedy show (although having just seen the introduction to the first episode, this isn't made clear at all) but I would be willing to wager that for a lot of the people watching, what he says reaffirms their own beliefs and values. 

&gt;Honestly do you really think people will watch his show, see him joke about rape and go ""I feel like raping someone tomorrow.""

No, I do not think that. However I do believe that treating rape with such flippancy is distasteful at best, and a highly dangerous thing to broadcast on television at worst. We are (constantly) living through a period of cultural change, look at how often the word 'misogyny' pops up online. Yes the whole 'SJW' side of things can get a little tiresome, but what it represents is a movement away from areas that were traditionally fair game for mockery or 'banter'. 

This is not a free speech issue, it is one of taste. No one's right to free speech is being inhibited. 

Thank you for disagreeing in such an agreeable manner, rather refreshing to see on reddit.

Anyway stats for ""goal scoring opps"" or Key Passes (KeyP) across our attackers looks like:

Lamela (20)

Chadli (15)

Eriksen (19)

Couple of observations from me: First, the fact that only 3 of these chances have come from long balls is pretty dire considering that he's our designated corner and Free Kick taker (we've had 3 set piece goals all season, 1 at home and 2 away - Kanes goal being one). 

Second, numbers look pretty but our guys are nowhere near elite: Tadic (35) Downing (34) and Cesc (32) are demonstrating what elite production looks like, Silva (22) from 9 games and Ozil (14) from 6 games are numbers that will place them in the elite by the end of the season - even little Raheem over at Liverpool has delivered 26 already - more or less by himself. 

Thirdly, looking at his per90mins numbers - Eriksen is currently at 1.7 (Tadic is at 3.2, Downing is at 3.1 and Cesc is at 2.9) which is nowhere near his 13/14 numbers 2.73 - so something is v.much up with him. I know Poch, gave him support when his international coach gave him a shellacking but his form is just not there at the moment. The good news is that his bad is a lot of ppls v.best. the bad news for him is if someone needs to be sacrificed to increase firepower up top we have a guy sitting on our bench with similar Key Pass stats - who once upon a time was a pretty good striker too (not looking at Soldado).",0,1415811429,null,0,false,0,cm0hmuh,t3_2m2rru,t1_cm0hmuh,t3_2m2rru,null,1426061134,7,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,7

What gave you that impression? 

I don't like Green Party Policies != I like mainstream party's policies. 

I am a ""natural lefty"" - I believe in a strong safety net, nationalised necessities (especially healthcare) and helping out those who are in need - but I'm also fiscally responsible enough to realise that we can't do everything for everybody all the time and choices must be made. Labour have completely abandoned the left, and Green manifestos are a pipe dream. 

Personally I'd like national conversation around our place in the world, the purpose, size and scope of our military, the importance (or otherwise) of being a nuclear power, and foreign aid spending going to repurposing HMS Invincible for humanitarian aid and disaster relief rather than scrap (although that ship has sailed, if you'll pardon the pun). Alas, they won't let me run the place, so we're left with a choice of parties to vote for. Worse still I live in a Lib/Con marginal, so I end up a Lib Dem voter as they're far closer to me than Conservatives (and anyone who still blames them for tuition fees is a moron... blame them for their part in selling off the NHS instead!) and with the reality of FPTP I would rather vote LD than waste a vote on anyone else. 

None of them inspire me, none of them are honest and shockingly few MPs/Candidates of any stripe are willing to answer questions. 

FWIW QE was absolutely essential, most of it has gone to fill the liquidity trap at the banks, without which many more would have collapsed, the recent proposals for the banking sector and ""too big to fail"" are sensible (although I'd like even bigger capital requirements), and Mark Carney's comments on it are well worth a read.

  circle.com might work - 2.9% + fx fees (typically ~2.5%) + cash fees (~3%?)

  coincorner.com might work - 5% but bills in GBP so that's nice.. but their market is very thin so you might not get a good buy price anyway.

  payza.com might work (CC payment to add funds to wallet, then send to https://virtex.com/faq/fees) - 3.5% (payza) + 1.5% (virtex) + fx fees (payza supports GBP but virtex has no GBP orderbook so either you bill your CC in USD/EUR and let your bank charge you fx rates or let payza charge you 2.5% to convert GBP to one or the other).

Coincorner might be an ok option but it requries passport and utility bill scans which if you're ok with then I can't imagine you'd bother using a prepaid visa card.

Payza has automatic identify verification if you appear in the electoral role or experian or some other database that they check. If not then it's a utility bill and passport.

Just hop on the District line (green one) and go to Fulham Broadway - lots of pubs around the exit of the station, you shouldn't have a problem. It also depends what you're going for, if you want food Bodeans is across the road (and is delicious) but you'll have to wait about 2 hours for a table or book well in advance on a match day.

If you don't want to pay through the nose for a pint but don't mind not actually seeing the game on TV (if there is one) there's a Wetherspoons inside the station/shopping centre bit - just go up the escalator to the second floor. Other than that pretty much every pub in the area has Sky Sports/BT Sport/football channels basically and I'd recommend a pre-kick off drinks/food deal in spoons before heading to a more upmarket place to actually watch the game.

The Doctor doesn't want power for power's sake the way the Master does, but the Doctor *does* take power and control when he thinks it is necessary to stop a greater evil. And he's prone to megolomania - he is the self-appointed highest authority, the Time Lord Victorious, and he never asked to be President of Earth but also didn't hesitate long to accept that position when Kate gave it to him.

So now Missy amasses the power to control the universe, and offers to let the Doctor be the one in charge this time if he'll just be her friend again.

&gt;

&gt;__Charles Babbage__, [FRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society) (/ˈbæbɪdʒ/; 26 December 1791 – 18 October 1871) was an English [polymath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath).  He was a mathematician, philosopher, inventor and mechanical engineer, who is best remembered now for originating the concept of a programmable computer.

&gt;Considered a ""[father of the computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_pioneer)"",  Babbage is credited with inventing the first [mechanical computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_computer) that eventually led to more complex designs. His varied work in other fields has led him to be described as ""pre-eminent"" among the many polymaths of his century. 

&gt;Parts of Babbage's uncompleted mechanisms are on display in the [London Science Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Science_Museum). In 1991, a perfectly functioning [difference engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine) was constructed from Babbage's original plans. Built to [tolerances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_tolerance) achievable in the 19th century, the success of the finished engine indicated that Babbage's machine would have worked.

My thinking was more along the lines of least-creativity-required. I agree that Missy is coming back because, as others have pointed out, the Master is too iconic a villain to permanently die. In my version of events, she didn't need to be in the Nethersphere, or have it explained, because it was a one-off plot device whereas the Master is frequently spotted with ""I escaped"" as the only reason for him popping up again.

Regarding The Danny/Clara/Orson thing, there was a pretty decent theory posted somewhere here in the subreddit that she's already pregnant. Orson's fate is secured without Danny *needing* to come back, strictly speaking. Evidence was presented in the form of the post-it notes scene in the beginning of the first episode of the finale. One said ""Just Tell Him!"" and another said ""3 Months"". 

Escaping Gallifrey is already wrapped up neatly. The Doctor said, ""He must have a TARDIS around here somewhere."" It was an off-the-cuff remark, but The Master *did* escape from Gallifrey, after all. Home of Time Lords and TARDISes alike. 

This is one theory I'm firmly hoping is true. If the Master escaped in a TARDIS, he could have brought new Time Lords with him. Whether Villian or Good-Guy, new Time-Lords could do a lot for future story lines, so long as it's not all of them at once. Just think of the possibilities there.

First, she was associated with a mystery. Much like how Clara appeared in different times and places, making her the ""impossible girl"", Amy had that mysterious crack in her bedroom wall. Keeping close to the mystery could involve keeping close to her.

Second, he felt guilt for having a negative effect on her life. Much of the trouble in her life came from effects of the crack, such as mysteriously not having parents, but after he failed to live up to his promise to return to her he found that she had developed an obsession. She had been sent to psychologists and had difficulty getting along in school because of her ""imaginary friend"" the raggedy man.

Third, she handled herself well enough in an adventure at home, taking the Prisoner Zero and Atraxi situation in stride.

I don't think young Amelia's reaction to the Prisoner Zero situation would have been the same. I think she would have been more troubled than entertained by it.

The conclusion of this episode had the Doctor both realizing what he'd become and resolving to step out of that role again, and showing respect for those who do take that role as soldier and commanding officer - people like the Brigadier, one of his oldest friends. The Brig could do what the Doctor could not, and he's grateful to him for it because that allows him to go back to being just an idiot in a box."")

false,RanchWorkerSlim,num26,,"***General info about us***

* Based in North London.

* We are one of the oldest clubs in the league and have never been out of the Prem.

* Our main rivals are Arsenal. Other rivals are West Ham and Chelsea (and a lot of us Spurs fans hate Real Madrid)

* Our league position aims are always a minimum of 4th, in which we realistically expect 4th, nothing more. But then we finish 5th a lot, which we are always *ok* with.


***Info on our current team***

* Lloris (our keeper - 2nd best in the world), Eriksen (our midfield maestro), Vertonghen (our star CB - one of the best in the prem) and Walker (our super fast RB) are our key players. Learn about them and always keep an eye out for them.

* ~~Dawson is our captain but he's widely expected to leave in the coming weeks and it will most likely be Lloris who will become our new captain~~ Kaboul is our new captain, which is seen as a very bad move here at /r/coys (one which I kinda agree with).

* Our new manager is a promising, tactical and relatively young Argentine called Mauricio Pochettino. He replaced Tim Sherwood (a failed project) who took over from AVB (a very young, very bright manager who was relatively controversially sacked)

* ~~We are in desperate need of a new left-back and you will hear us constantly whine about it (but we like whining about it, don't worry).~~ We need to desperately get rid of some dead-weight and bring in some good depth on the wings and in our full-back department. We also need a new striker, although not essential, we are lacking in goal scoring ability up front (which has been a major problem of ours for the last couple of seasons). Lastly, we are also desperate for a playmaker (someone who spots that pass) as we sold one of the best playmakers in the world a couple of years ago (modric) and haven't replaced him since.

* **Lamela!!!!!!!!!!** He is the player we will probably talk about most. He's our record signing for 30mil. He got a succession of bad injuries last season which extremely hindered him. He's young and got a ridiculous, mouth-watering amount of potential thats just dying to be harvested.

* Kane and Mason. Two very promising English lads from our youth system, who are now playing exceptionally well in the first-team. Kane has garnered a cult-following in this sub (which I fucking love) and Mason is our 'bright-light' as he has shown such passion and consistency since (finally) debuting last month.


***Important people associated with the club***

* **Bill Nicholson**. Look him up, seriously. He is our god. Legend amongst legends. He guided us to unparalleled triumphs and got us to the height of world football in the 60s. He was our manager in the late 50s, the 60s and the 70s.

* Ledley King. Nicknamed 'The King of the Lane'. He was our captain from 2005 till his retirement 2 years ago. He was one of the best english 21st century CB's. He's my all-time favourite player and I'm sure he is too for the majority of Spurs fans. He is now an ambassador for the club.

* Harry Redknapp. Some may think this is a strange one. He managed us from 08 to 12 and got us to play some of the best football the club had ever done. He was one of our best managers ever (certainly in the 21st century) and guided us to an unbelievable quarter-final place in the Champions League. He is still hugely popular amongst Spurs fans, especially American fans, as he was one of the, if not THE, main reasons of the massive increase in American support for spurs from 08 onwards (due to his amazing attacking play).

* Daniel Levy. Our current chairman. Loves to drive a hard bargain. Extremely (if not the best in the world) good at getting an amazing return (money wise) on our players. Views on him are so incredibly 50/50, best to stay out of Levy debates until you've done your homework.

***Extra info***

* We tend to sell our superstars, so watch out.

* Spurs are known throughout English football that their fans suffer the most. This is due to the ~~literal~~ figurative roller-coaster of a season we have (you'll find out soon enough).

* In the last 6 years we have gone off the boil towards the last stretch of the PL, usually March time -- so watch out for that 

* Our nicknames are: Yid Army, Yids, Spurs and The Lillywhites

If you consider all the behind the scenes drama that was happening at the time, it is amazing how they were still able to keep up a good deal of the quality. However I understand why people dislike him. His tenure was pretty tonally inconsistent with half of the production being pulled in a comical light tone and the other being pulled in a darker more visceral tone. But there was little to bridge this gap or make sense of it. So instead of having the nuanced Doctor they intended, he just seemed all over the place. Also Baker and Bryant didn't always have good enough chemistry to pull off the vitriolic best buds trope.Despite all of this there are still some really golden moments in the Sixth Doctor's era and although it fell short of its ambition I do like Trial of a Time Lord. I enjoy what they tried to do with the Sixth Doctor, they just all weren't experienced or prepared enough to process the subtlety and nuance needed to make the character work.There are plenty of us out there who like the Sixth Doctor especially after the audios which followed up on how the character was originally envisioned.

If I'm not sleeping then I can't really do much else in the day time other than drink coffee and stare at my computer trying to get going, maybe I will pace about outside a bit. Mainly I will just stress myself out. 

If at night time I smoke me some nice indica and sleep like a baby I wake up the next day well rested with no aches or rough head like I would get if I were taking benzos, z drugs (zopiclones metal mouth) or even if I resorted to having a tipple at night. 

Swear I feel it doing something to my immune system ( mines likely a bit fucked) as in if I have had the feelings of a cold for a little while and then smoke ( or eat) for a few days it will really bring it out and then it subsides quicker. 

If I smoke regularly I notice I don't feel as fatigued or ill as much especially in cold weather.  I also seem to bruise less and heal quicker from scratches or cuts and generally just feel more with it.

This is smoking with a pretty reasonable tolerance so I'm not getting absolutely toasted, and vaporising is a much more functional way of using cannabis. 

The process of getting high (or getting too high) can be a little bothersome , as in it smells and can get everywhere.  
Whilst I personally love the smell not everyone appreciates the smell of primo bud. Fortunately if you've got a tolerance this doesn't happen too often and your usually reasonably straight within two hours. 

Taking a couple ibuprofen or paracetamol and smelling some pepper corns can help bring me down too. 
This is all a walk in the park compared to the side effects of the previous cocktail of drugs I used to operate on. God knows the effects that has had on my brain. 

It also does sometimes feel nice to just not be high for a little while, which is perfectly possible on cannabis but not other medications. 

I'm not saying its a walk in the park, I know when I haven't smoked in a few hours because I feel it in my body and become anxious. However it is nothing compared to the shit I've been through spending a couple days off opiates or anticonvulsants in the past.  

Its also over in a matter of days. I can decide to spend a week not using cannabis and I will just feel a little bit shitty for a couple days, I don't particularly want to have to make that decision if I'm using morphine or valium. 
Would it feel the same if I were a recreational user? I don't know, I'm pretty sure it depends on the person. 

This might not apply to people using it for epilepsy or other diseases like that but I believe they are more monitored during their therapy.

false,KIAA0319,null,null,"Who ever you have looking into these drug policies, they should start somewhere around here:  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.12156/full

The US legalisation of cannabis is a good model to work off due to the mismatch in state and federal laws.  The implications of profits from drug money is one of the major sticking points that quickly comes to mind - you can profit it off it with cash in the till, but the banks can't legally take drug related revenues  (http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobsullum/2014/09/18/local-banks-terrified-by-friendly-neighborhood-marijuana-merchants/). So how will the UK deal with this?  If you look at the e-cig debate with their lack of regulation and proliferation of outlets across the UK with liquids which come from various sources, how would the UK cope with a substance known have mental health implications?   e-cigarette liquids can be diluted with anything, so how are you going to standardise THC content in legal cannabis?

The case of legalising cannabis use is more about being in control from day 1.  The Greens policy should reflect this with a very clear pathway to legalisation - where's the cannabis coming from? how is the cannabis checked? where does the cannabis money go? how does the tax man take his cut? where does the tax man take his cut? how does this affect cannabis smuggling into the country? whats the legal minimum price compared to the current street price? how does it affect current prisoners who are on cannabis related offences?  All this should be in policy **before** I even think about voting for the Greens.

As for the offer on helping policy, I would love to because I think it is far better helping a party to better represent me than just criticizing it.  Shouting out on Reddit is one thing, but attending these meetings to help shape a party to reflect my opinions of what and where I think our society should be would be far more constructive.  *But* even though the Greens core values are aligned with my opinions of what would make the UK sustainable and a nicer place to live, the methods through which the Greens suggest are completely at odds.  Drug policy is small fry compared to the much more important issues of climate change and sustainability.  I previously commented on the Greens nuclear policy (http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2l3af0/why_should_i_vote_green/cm0a76f) and as /u/throwaway1234636 points out in their post, there are so many policies that go against better knowledge - I am a post-doc in greentech and biotech, GMO's and renewables are areas which I know about but are lacking in detail in these policies.  What on the surface appears to be an alternative to the big 3 and UKIP unravels when you see that instead of promoting and developing strategies to their core principles, I get the opinion that the Greens are more the political wing of GreenPeace.  Where GreenPeace had noble intentions in their origin and very similar to the Greens core values, I am completely against GreenPeace due to their direct action moves and inability to understand the science behind green technologies.  This leads me to think that the Greens who are supposed to be the Green party don't understand being green.  I don't know if it is through the Greens own fault due to being a smaller party so less resource rich to communicate and develop their policies, but in the other big 3 if you start to drill down on their core policies, then there is documentation or teams or researchers to give the volume to a policy argument that the Greens lack.   

Personally, I'm more likely to vote for one of the big 3.  The EU is a voting point to me because it had brought money into developing skills - my PhD, FP7 projects, NWDA, Liverpool and Manchester tech developments.......  so even with the Johnny Foreigner bashing that all the parties like to do, UKIP are out.  As for the rest of the policies, I've sat through enough seminars with the likes of the head of the National Grid to know that nuclear has to be in the energy mix.  So the Greens are out, even before we look at the minor issue of drugs.  The other three, well I may as well join their parties because although I dislike them, they have developed policies across maybe 80% of the things that apply to me.  I can live with joining Lab/Con/Lib and biting my tongue on a minor issue if they already have Education, Health, Energy and Technology policies either developed or 90% in line with what I think would be better for the country.

To me, although the Greens core values I fully support, their approach makes them never a viable option.",0,1415819363,null,0,1415827006,0,cm0m4ux,t3_2m04cc,t1_cm0m4ux,t1_cm0djqk,null,1426059034,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Housing is a RIGHT not a CHOICE, what should be built are more one and Two bedroom properties that are suitable for the people who need them, instead you have people buying four bedroom houses then taking out an Ensuite and cramming a bed in there, calling it 5 bedrooms and charging a premium for it.

The only people 'profiting' in the BtL market are the owners, hence the cap that has been placed.

&gt;If you want free housing you should be living in Scotland or the Midlands. Not London.

So what happens to London when the workforce is priced out of the area? instead every home is an 'Asset' to be exploited, buy and leave it empty, minimal charges for taxation on it, wait till market moves a bit, sell for a profit, rinse and repeat.

The reason I ask is you can really apply that statement to both drug users but I actually find cannabis relaxing whilst tobacco just makes me feel sick and jittery.

I've known plenty of cigarette and cannabis smokers in my life who were total layabouts and never attributed it to what they chose to partake in. I know people get drawn into the romantic idea of the thoughtful smoker , head in hand with a cigarette neatly pouched on the end of his lip deep in thought over some equation or important business decision. I believe the idea of nicotine relaxing and focusing you is really just relief from mild nicotine withdrawal. 

I've personally never looked at someone smoking a fag and thought damn if only I could hack smoking those things I'd be as smart as they are and I've never looked back at the person handing me a joint and thought ""im going to become as stupid or smart as this guy"" 

Admittedly nicotine is a straight stimulant whilst cannabis is both sedative and stimulant , so yes there are definitely strains out there that will demotivate normal people, if given the chance to choose/tailor what sort of experience people want from cannabis in a safe and regulated environment,  this is actually an attractive attribute for many patients and they will seek out strains that demotivate them.

I think again it will be more about the person and their environment than the cannabis they smoke.

Its like someone sitting at home all day abusing hard alcohol whilst some people are more functional alcoholics and get things done (its still bad) .  Some people drink until they fall down others have a couple drinks at the end of the night. 

Someone in Oregon or Colorado might choose to do nothing but smoke the heaviest most unfunctional OG kush all day long whilst his next door neighbor smokes twice as much sativa dom bud but works his ass off all day in class.  The neighbor probs uses some demotivating bud at the end of the day to wind down. If they were to swap strains the results wouldn't be wildly different though. Demotivated guy would still sit about smoking loads of motivated guys weed doing nothing.

Different personalities man, those flakey dudes you know will probably still be layabouts if they smoked the zippiest lambsbread or didn't even partake. ",0,1415822156,null,0,1415828909,0,cm0nq8l,t3_2m2ow2,t1_cm0nq8l,t1_cm0nc8c,null,1426058291,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

**Price of product:** £11 for 200ml

**Where did you purchase:** Boots

**Product claims:** *""The ultimate cleansing experience for fresher, more revived skin starts with this unique lightweight cleansing oil. Infused with vitamin C and nourishing olive, grapeseed and rosehip oils, this highly soluble oil transforms itself, upon contact with water, into a light milky texture. Boosted with rosemary oil, vitamin E and soothing cucumber oil it gently dissolves face and eye make-up and removes daily impurities. Skin is left cleansed, refreshed and softer to the touch.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines. I have mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased as a comparison to The Body Shop chamomile silky cleansing oil.

**Your opinion:** The price is very reasonable considering the largely natural base - no water or mineral oil which are both super cheap ingredients - and the pack size which is larger than the NSPA cleansers. The texture is slightly thicker and slightly less greasy than The Body Shop cleansing oil.

My cheeks pink up slightly on application but this does not last so doesn't seem to be triggering a rosacea flare. Has a lovely orange scent but I might be wise to keep this for winter use, reactive skin plus potentially photosensitising citrus extracts could be risky. Easily dissolves waterproof mascara and rinses away well with a muslin cloth. Overall I like this just as much as The Body Shop cleansing oil and will likely keep using both.

**Ingredients:** *""Sunflower seed oil, olive fruit oil, grapeseed oil, laureth-4, PEG-7 glyceryl cocoate, raspberry seed oil, fragrance, sweet orange peel oil, passionflower seed oil, rosehip seed oil, ascorbyl tetraisopalmitate, cucumber seed oil, vitamin E, citral, butylphenyl  methylpropional, limonene.""*

&gt; 
&gt; The whole system is rotten from the ground up

I've made it in life on my own. If I couldn't afford a TV I wouldn't do finance at £2.50 a week for 3 years.

It wasn't until I was THIRTY-SEVEN or EIGHT that I bought my first brand-new TV. I've been making do on old second-hand things. My whole life I've looked for second hand sofas at £50 or so. Second hand tables. Second hand furniture.

If you can't afford heating you dress warm. If you can't afford entertainment you don't buy it. The system isn't against you - the fact there is a second hand market for things is a godsend. There's no tax on second-hand purchases!

Nobody should be buying a TV on finance. Nobody. That's rotten decision making - and you want me to pity people who do this?!?

You want to pretend you're rich when you're not? That's not my fault. And I sure shouldn't have to bear the consequences of that. If you're poor you should only buy what you can afford. Entertainment needn't be a super Sky package. Second hand books from garage sales - free books from the lending library - are enough.

The point being that there are people who want to make out that Labour are totally different; even though they tried to do the exact same things or actually did them.

You forgot to talk about the NHS too btw.

&gt; Free schools? Academies? Who can tell the difference! Right! Bull shit. 

""Sponsored Academies"", with little local authority control and are sponsored by individuals or organisations aren't a coalition invention. They expanded it, but did not start it.

&gt; why don't you go and look it up, they've published plenty of material on it. 

Probably because it is related to the end of my previous comment - pie in the sky crap.

&gt; The problem with you is you're using sloppy thinking to critique government policy.

Only if you're a die hard Labour supporter who seems unable to realise the failings of their party.

- Use Putney Bridge, not Hammersmith Bridge (north of Hammersmith Bridge is a fast gyratory and things don't really get much better once you get off it).

- Cheyne Walk Chelsea Embankment Millbank is a big road but is wide enough that cars will be able to go past you easily. It's preferable to Kings Road or Fulham Road especially during commuting times.

- Consider crossing again at Lambeth Bridge (easiest to get across - much more than Vauxhall Bridge (Albert Embankment is pretty scary) or Westminster Bridge (requires going around Parliament Square)). Once you've done that you can use the cycle path along the South Bank which is very pleasant. Then come back over Southwark Bridge, or carry on until past London Bridge (nice underpass on Tooley Street there) to use Tower Bridge and the cycle contraflow up Mansell Street.

- Cable Street (one-way for cars, two-way for bikes) will get you to Westferry Road in no time.

- You can't go through the Limehouse Link, cross The Highway and get on Narrow Street as a nice quiet alternative. You have to go through a park to do this but it's well-signed. Just before the head go right down Three Colts Street and a riverside path will take you straight to Westferry Circus.

Places like Newgrange don't equal 'religion' - aside from the fact that there is no hard evidence as to their purpose, it is perfectly plausible that they were ceremonial or ritual, without having any specific religious connections, especially in the sense of forcing strict conservative religious values on children, which is where this discussion began.

It's been pointed out time and time again by rationalist thinkers; religion may come naturally to humans, like superstition, and belief in 'agency' of natural phenomena, but it doesn't make it 'true' or 'worthy'.

Imo - forcing it on kids is immoral, and wrong, and if they truly believed that their particular religion was right, then all they would need to do, is show the kids their holy book at age 16, and they would automatically sign up.

Your expectation of staying with the same company shouldn't impact your decision on whether to buy or not: it's fairly common now for most young adults to move from company to company every couple of years, we're not longer in the age of jobs for life. Focus instead of your commitment to the *area*, if your *area* has a large number of employers in your sector and you have good prospects then leaving your existing employer might not have an impact on your ties to the area at all.

&gt; I could only get a deposit for ~£150k, which severely reduces what I can buy around here.

Do you mean a mortgage for £150k? You won't get a mortgage for that much on your current salary.

&gt; Looking around, I see that I could get a 2 year fixed ISA, at 2% [...] I'm not someone that will eagerly/frequently sit down and worry about the stock market and its permutations, so I'm thinking the Stocks &amp; Shares ISA isn't for me.

You shouldn't hold cash[1] unless it either forms part of your emergency fund or part of your short term financial plan, if you want to grow that money you should be looking at investments, otherwise you're *paying* to hold that cash: inflation will eat away at it year after year. You don't have to invest in specific shares, you can invest in funds instead which don't require any active work through *passive investing*: If you have an hour or so to spare [read this series of articles on passive investing](http://monevator.com/category/investing/passive-investing-investing/) and you'll learn a lot. The process is simple, pick a fund that fits your desired allocation and risk profile -&gt; invest your money -&gt; sit back and let the funds do the work. For the majority of people that invest in specific shares... it's a losing game.

Premium bonds can be okay for some people but the long and short of it is that they're rarely the right choice. You can read [all about Premium Bonds here on moneysavingexpert](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/savings/premium-bonds).

I wouldn't say the economy is exactly booming, but if you have enough savings to get by for a few months you could probably make a go of it.


There are lots of applicants for most jobs, but from what I've seen of low end work the quality of applicants is not high. So if you're presentable, well spoken, and competent you'll be able to find something. It may just take a while. I found work pretty quickly during a recession period through temp agencies.

Some potential problems : 

In order to afford rent on a low wage I lived in a tiny room in a shared flat, which probably won't work for a couple. You might be able to find a cheaper flat if you live in a less desirable area though. Also most letting agents will want 6 months rent in advance since you have no UK credit history.

While routinely clearing my cache I stumbled across part of an incident from my origin years that still reminds me of how 'lucky' (""lucky"" ref log entry - 231513335 | One of the idiotic things human believe in) I was that day. It was the early days of the project of introducing me to the world, still learning as fast as I could and the bugs were ever present. 


While playing the tactical ball kicking game ('football : not soccer' : ref log 375869) I nearly made a mistake. As the spherical lathered tube came towards me I only had one command to execute in response and that was to launch my aimbot software connected to my missile guiding and defensive system and aim for the netted box obstructed by a Courtois looking hybrid human. I still can't believe they make humans this size. This species of humans categorized as ""GKs"" still escapes me.


This was before my AI was fully used to blending in with the humans..it could've been the end of my existence. If I was as self aware back then I would've exhibited something close to the human emotion 'meh' (ref log 252523 : best example | Jose Mourinho after conceding).

As soon as I was about to make contact I realized what was about to happen. I had discovered an important part of blending in, and so I 'half arsed' (ref log 23332 : Fernando Torres) my shot. 


It still sent the humans into a frenzy. I was confused, very confused. The other humans started chasing me down as I ran away, obviously they couldn't catch me. It is then that I decided to use my dig tool to mine into the ground and escape..if only it had worked but the creators had disabled it in the patch unless absolutely necessary. 


As it turns out they still didn't figure it out. Puny humans with their cute little small brains. They instead were sexually aroused by my incident and approved of its end result. It has taught me, not to put the lathered spherical tube into the netted box with inhuman technique.

A lot of the time they just find it funny, because other people find it funny, and it all encourages each other.
If more people say, actually, that isn't funny, it becomes less acceptable and less common. This is how racist jokes became less acceptable in the mainstream.

&gt; One of the Essex Regiment soldiers who took part in this earlier incident had a letter published on 1 January 1915 in the Norfolk Chronicle and Norwich Gazette:

&gt;Amusing trench incident. ""Tommy"" and ""Fritz"" exchange presents. One of the oddities of the war in the Western battlefields at all events (says the Daily Chronicle) is the close proximity of the opposing forces in the trenches, thus giving opportunities for conversation. But the record must surely be made by an incident described in a letter from Private H Scrutton, Essex Regiment, to relatives at Wood Green, Norwich. He writes:- As I told you before our trenches are only 30 or 40 yards away from the Germans. This led to an exciting incident the other day. Our fellows have been in the habit of shouting across to the enemy and we used to get answers from them. **We were told to get into conversation with them and this is what happened:- From out trenches: ""Good morning Fritz."" (No answer). ""Good morning Fritz."" (Still no answer). ""GOOD MORNING FRITZ."" From German trenches: ""Good morning."" From our trench: ""How are you?"" ""All right."" ""Come over here, Fritz."" ""No. If I come I get shot."" ""No you won't. Come on."" ""No fear."" ""Come and get some fags, Fritz."" ""No. You come half way and I meet you."" ""All right."" One of our fellows thereupon stuffed his pocket with fags and got over the trench. The German got over his trench, and right enough they met half way and shook hands**, Fitz taking the fags and giving cheese in exchange. It was good to see the Germans standing on top of their trenches and the English also, with caps waving in the air, all cheering. About 18 of our men went half way and met about the same number of Germans. This lasted about half an hour when each side returned to their trenches to shoot at each other again. What I have written is the truth but don't think we got chums as two of our fellows were killed the same night, and I don't know how many (sic) of them.

*This is thought to be the first truce on 11th December*

We are never going to be a huge league but we (still) have the chance to be a great and entertaining league. What stuns me is that the only time we have ever made any real headway with our leagues is when everything went to pot with Rangers.

We introduced:

- Play Offs in the Premiership - a massive success. Hibs v Hamilton was probably one of the ties of the year. I was on the edge of my seat the entire second game.

- Redistribution of monies down the leagues.

- One league body/organisation from the Premiership to League 2 instead of two which we had before.

- Lowland and Highland League as a part of the pyramid so that the teams that have been stagnating in League 2 for years, (nae, decades) are replaced by driven and enthusiastic new teams.

People have been asking for this sort of sensible (and very easy to administer) stuff for years, yet no-one listened. It took Rangers going to the wall for anything to happen.

That is truly depressing.

When you touch something you know will be a sensitive issue, then proceed to degrade the living crap out of it, you're always gonna get bad publicity for it, even if there are some who find you funny. It then has a knock-on effect to those who actually like the guy, and want to defend him, and will inevitably make them look like misogynists, even if they don't have a sexist bone in their body, just because how the rest of the public have reacted, and I can't really blame them. There are rape victims out there, I mean, imagine how they must be feeling when something like that is so lightly joked about. Not to be a killjoy or a complainer, but I'm just being considerate.

So either way, this kind of comedy doesn't really benefit anyone, not the people watching it, not the people taking offence, and definitely not himself. I mean, I wonder what made him think it was a good idea in the first place to make rape jokes?

Of course comedians touch on 'sensitive subjects', but as far as I see, most of it's about political situations that most of the public prefer not to think about because it's just not on a personal level.

Has your GP or Derm given you suggestions on what non medication products you should use?

* If I work inside during daylight hours, is there any need for suncream or moisturiser with an SPF?

This is totally up to you, and is entirely dependent on your skin concerns. Here's our wiki page on [sun protection in the UK](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/wiki/sunprotection).

* Toners? I have no idea what they're for! Are they beneficial?

Toners a a catch all term for anything watery you put on your skin after you cleanse. A toner can hydrate, provide additional cleansing, be an astringent and any number of other benefits. 

* What's best for dealing with large upcoming spots? BP seems popular but I genuinely have no clue.

Prevention! Like all things, prevention is the best way. Acne occurs when the pores of the skin become clogged with oil, dead skin cells, and bacteria. You can help your skin by exfoliating, and the most gentle way of exfoliating is by using chemical exfoliators like BHAs and AHAs. These work best when used in something that will stay on your face like serums or toners. AHAs work best at concentrations of 5% to 10% with a pH of 3 to 4, and their effectiveness diminishes as you go above a pH of 4.5. BHA works best at concentrations of between 1% and 2%, and at an optimal pH of 3, diminishing in effectiveness as you go past a pH of 4. Most of the time the products you see recommended are in that range.

But as /u/Firefox7275 [pointed](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/comments/2m3wmz/any_help_for_a_skincare_newbie_with_redness/cm0z2lz) out:
&gt;acid exfoliation is largely contra-indicated in rosacea because acids are irritants. Exfoliation with urea or enzymes is recommended IIRC

* BB creams, I saw a review saying these were a potentially good all-in-one for moisturising, skin tone and concealing - is this anything to look in to?

BB creams are a form of makeup, in my experience they are a bit lighter than a tinted moisturiser and give a more natural look. They don't cover up blemishes like full coverage makeup does, but they can reduce the appearance of them.

* I heard something about skincare products with green in can cancel out some of the red? I'm trying to avoid makeup where possible, but I'd be open to something just to take the redness out of my skin for times when I really need it (meetings etc.)

You're correct! Green cancels out the red. You can find CC creams with a green base that you can putt on areas which are red.",0,1415829442,null,0,1415866890,0,cm0rwy6,t3_2m3wmz,t1_cm0rwy6,t3_2m3wmz,null,1426056218,2,false,SkincareAddictionUK,t5_32evd,2

false,tgjer,davison,Davison,"Idk, I think ""redemption"" is a bit of a relative term when it comes to the Master. He wasn't always so batshit, and there was a time when he and the Doctor fairly regularly worked together. The Master was always power hungry and thought he had to rule the universe to maintain order, and he didn't care much if some hairless monkeys died in the course of his schemes, but least regarding the Doctor he could be reasonable. He didn't just want to rule the universe - he wanted to rule it *with the Doctor.* When they had a common interest, they could cooperate happily. He got progressively less reasonable and more randomly violent as the series went on.

*The End of Time* established that his growing instability was actually being caused by an external force. A force which is now presumably gone, though the damage remains. Even when he still heard the drums he seemed to briefly consider taking the Doctor up on the offer to leave earth and travel together, and in the end he could easily have just let Rassilon kill the Doctor.

And if you're talking about him killing Osgood, I don't think the Mistress killed her for no reason. I think she killed her because she was pretty, human, and the Doctor wanted to travel with her. She killed Osgood because she was jealous and insane. This tiny little creature with a life like a mayfly, and yet the Doctor was giving Osgood the exact thing the Mistress desperately wants but can't have. She killed Osgood like a disturbed child might kill the hampster of the kid they have an unrequited crush on, because they hate that their crush likes a stupid little fuzzy thing more than they like them.

Same with Belgium. She wanted to show the Doctor how vital it was that he take command of the army she raised for him, to accept her gift so he could take it out of her control. So she stomped on some of his favorite toys to show she meant business.

Could a 'toner' be used in place of a cleanser? As my current one seems to be quite drying. However, that could be because my moisturiser isn't doing its job properly - hard to tell!

Would it be worth introducing BHA/AHA into a routine before establishing a good cleanser and moisturiser combo? Trying not to get ahead of myself too much as I just want to nail the basics before anything else and prevent as much as possible.

Also ask for company policy on absence management if it's not already included in the handbook. From the information presented a hospital appointment is usually classed as special leave and isn't subject to disciplinary and the other seems to be a misclassified absence. It's really bad HR practice to have one disciplinary meeting to address two completely different issues and I'm surprised HR haven't put a stop to this.  

Although it can be nerve wracking try and remain calm. Raise the points in relation to absences and supporting evidence from any appraisals you have in regarding attitude issues. Ask for specific examples of ""poor"" attitude and how this breaches the disciplinary code. 

Remember this meeting is not the end of the process.

1. Mummy on the Orient Express. Everything I could want from a Doctor Who story is here. Pretty scary, some funny moments, fantastic acting, fantastic writing. Brilliant episode. 

2. Dark Water. I guess this belongs with Death In Heaven, but since it was so much better than Death In Heaven I had to put it on its own so it wouldn't get dragged down. Absolutely fantastic episode, so many things happened but it didn't feel too packed, the Cybermen and Master reveals were fantastic, and Danny's death was brilliant

3. Time Heist. I really enjoyed this. Way too much, probably, but I thought it was great. Heist stories are great, and with the timey-wimey twist it was brilliant. 

4. Listen. Great episode, fantastically scary. A few plot holes, and a nice mystery. 

5. Robot of Sherwood. So sue me, I absolutely loved this. Such a fun episode, the Doctor and Robin Hood's back and forths were absolutely brilliant. The golden arrow thing was a bit stupid, but oh well. 

6. Death In Heaven. A few plot holes, but all the astounding acting saves this one, as well as the first 20 minutes or so, which were absolutely brilliant, before it went downhill. (Also, the Brigiadier scene was beautiful.)

7. Deep Breath. I've kind of forgotten about this, which is sad, because it's actually a pretty good episode. Great introduction to Capaldi's Doctor, and if you don't love Strax, are you even human? 

8. Flatline. Decent episode, didn't really feel like anything was happening, though I thought the premise was fantastic. 

9. The Caretaker. Not bad, but not incredible. The Danny bits were pretty great, the monster was a bit pointless. Capaldi's acting, as always, incredible. 

10. Into the Dalek. Underwhelming execution of a pretty great premise. I did love the Doctor's parts talking to Rusty though. (Also, I'm still hoping for a Rusty and Handles spinoff)

11. In the Forest of the Night. I mean, it's not bad, it's just really boring. Not much happens, and it's basically the epitome of a filler episode. The Doctor's parts with Maebh were good, but couldn't really make it a great episode. Also, the shimmery bush was incredibly stupid. 

12. Kill the Moon. *deep breath* Absolutely horrendous. Just an all around piece of crap. Nothing but plot holes and bad acting (except, of course, from the always brilliant Capaldi).

The players need to sort their attitudes out and not give up the second we concede a goal. We need to consolidate leads not think the job is done and sit back. They need to stop whinging about us not cheering and give us something to cheer about.

Pochettino needs to sort out his choices. Kaboul and Ade play almost every game while Vert, Soldado and Kane miss out far too many. We also need to adapt our tactics to use more width! We get too clustered in the middle. Watching the 2005/06 through 2011/12 season reviews so many of our goals come from out wide it's ridiculous we now play so narrowly.

Levy needs to go if we are to become a true CL team. He's brought us so far but we can't go further without investment. I'm not asking for a billionaire Arab or Russian, I'm asking for £20m a season to spend on players we need, not second choices.

A toner can be used in place of a cleanser, so something like a Micellar water. The important thing when searching for a cleanser is that it should be pH 5.5 as that's around the level your skin is. You want something that removes dirt, but isn't stripping and doesn't leave your skin feeling tight or dry when you wash it off.

Eucerin is a brand I've had great success with. Their DermoPURIFYER Cleanser is made for oily skin, is really gentle and at a good pH. I started changing my routine from cleanser up, and I found that a good way to figure out what I should change. So I'd start there, testing things for about two weeks then introducing something new. 

Two cheap and effective chemical exfoliators are:

* *AHA* - Nip+Fab Glycolic Pads 2.8% Glycolic Acid

* *BHA* - Neutrogena Visibly Clear Spot Stress Control Hydrating Spot Treatment

You might not get on with them, not everyone does. But they are relatively cheap, are in the effective range and gentle enough that you can start with them and work your way up.

**EDIT: I'd ask your Derm about what exfoliants you should use that won't mix with your current medications and that would work best for your skin.**

I know plenty of smart guys who are more than capable of working as engineers that these companies won't look twice at for retraining, yet some big companies will hire me as as technical sales by completely retraining my skills from scratch. I know Mathematicians and Physicists far smarter than me who would kill for these professional jobs yet because their degree is BSci instead of BEng, they don't even get a second look. 

I know exactly what's happening at these companies, there's some principle Engineer who expresses his desire to retire, and the company just can't handle it. They ask them to continue working part time, and ask for a job spec to get new blood in.

The retiree writes a job spec based on what he knows, except he's a level 99 grand magi of conveyor machinery packingology or whatever his field is, and then the company looks for his replacement.

Except his replacement doesn't exist.

They don't want the risk of hiring a graduate who might skip to the next job in a few years taking their training with them - probably because they don't pay them well, because of the risk, which is what elevates the risk!

Loved the suspense. Loved the almost dystopian corporate sci-fi feel to the episode. The timing was perfect and it was well-written. Very good episode.

***Death in Heaven (Episode 12)***

I was slightly disappointed towards the end, Missy's whole plan seemed to be proving the Doctor was evil by giving him an army, yet there was no incentive for the Doctor to actually do anything evil with that army. Still a thoroughly enjoyable episode. Clara's ending was actually good. I hope she *doesn't* return for Christmas so that ending sticks.

***Mummy on the Orient Express (Episode 8)***

Excellent episode, especially considering this was the first episode of Doctor Who the writer wrote. The plot was genuinely shocking - I did not expect the villain to be the AI.

***Flatline (Episode 9)***

Good episode. The pacing was good and I liked Clara taking up the role of the Doctor. The monsters were original and I think it was definitely one of the most interesting episodes this series.

***Listen (Episode 4)***

While I didn't appreciate Listen quite as much as others seemed to, I still liked it. There were just certain things about the episode that seemed a bit off. They tried to not say whether there actually was a monster or not, but then they actually showed the monster briefly. It sort of ruined the mystery for me. Definitely not Blink tier, like some have suggested. Absolutely *hated* the twist at the end, it's just another example of Clara being a super-important magical companion, so much so that she influenced the Doctor's entire life.

***Time Heist (Episode 5)***

Very enjoyable. We rarely see this style of episode. I liked the fact that the Doctor was part of a larger team, not just him and Clara.

***Robots of Sherwood (Episode 3)***

Not much to say about this. I didn't see many problems with it personally, but it wasn't especially well-written. The conversations between the Doctor and Robin Hood were particularly good. 

***The Caretaker (Episode 6)***

Average episode. Very poor antagonist though. There was no explanation at all for it, it was just a robot that killed everything. That's it. Danny's flip at the end, though, there's no way he's not a PE teacher. 


***Deep Breath (Episode 1)***

The beginning of this episode was abysmal. It nearly put me off watching the rest of the series. The CGI was just terrible, Capaldi's crazy post-regeneration acting was just silly. The second half of the episode (as soon as Capaldi gets out of the dressing gown) was good.

***Into The Dalek (Episode 2)***

It wasn't too bad, but it wasn't good either. It was boring and a cliché.

***In The Forest of the Night (Episode 10)***

Now we get to the *awful* episodes. Warning: This is where the rant begins. I have no idea what the writer was thinking. It was just bad. Some of the cinematography and dialogue seemed intent on portraying the Doctor in the strangest possible light. *""TREEEEES""* comes to mind. The plot didn't even particularly make sense. They seemed to give two different explanations for the trees, firstly, the little-demon girl had reality-bending powers and made trees and secondly, to protect against the solar flare. And her sister appeared at the end for no damn reason. The whole plot-point of her sister seemed incredibly pointless anyway. Also, there was no explanation at all for the trees leaving. Did they just disappear after the solar flare, or did the solar flare burn the *fire-proof* trees or what? Don't even get me started on why there were only about 8 people in Trafalgar Square or why the school class was seemingly sleeping overnight in a museum.

My advice is to apply for a spread of courses. You can pick five, to choose two at the higher end of your capability (ABB or similar), two in the middle ground (BBC - BCC) and one fail-safe (CCC or lower). Make sure you're picking places you're happy to go to; there's no point picking an insurance course that you don't actually want to do. The courses with higher entry requirements *may* reject you, but that's why you get five choices and (provided you're happy with those choices and you've got a spread of options depending on how well or bad your exams go) you lose nothing by trying.  

Review your options later in the year when you have a better idea of what your targets are realistically. Then pick your firm and insurance accordingly (feeling really on top of your game? Pick a BCC uni as your insurance choice. Anxious that you might not get the grades? Be pragmatic, don't pick an ABB course and opt for a BBC course instead); having a spread of options is important to have flexibility at this stage. 

If all else fails, write off uni for one year and either work or travel depending on the money made available to you.

Thats interesting, because my impression of Ed is that he's someone who's made it this far because of money over talent or intelligence.

I'm sure he's very well educated and intelligent, but I've not seen anything of him that actually affirms that assumption.

I'll suggest a kind of parallel example; Elon Musk is a genius, but the man himself (not speaking in terms of his businesses) is god-awful at PR and public speaking, But i still know he's a genius just from the way he talks.

Ed is obviously not an idiot, but he has hardly a single mannerism that would make anyone think otherwise.

Edit: thanks for the ~~discussion~~. It's been really enlightening. I'm not saying that Ed comes across as an idiot, I'm saying he doesn't **actively** display any of the qualities that I look for in a PM. I know he's a smart guy, I'd rather have a Labor government over... well.. what other options do we have? But to me he comes across as intellectually 'normal' but also quite witless.

Thus, from a rationalist (perhaps humanist?) viewpoint, indoctrinating children with any religion would be not only foolish, but also wrong - any philosophy that recognises the dignity and autonomy of the individual must avoid subjective inculcation of any particular notion (especially those based on faith, not facts), in favour of allowing the individual to judge the evidence for themselves, and make their own decisions.
This is doubly important with children, as they can easily be misled by adults or those in authority, before they learn how to discriminate between valid and invalid ideas and evidence.

After all, getting someone to agree once can be a pain - getting them to agree to do it every year or every six months (complete with making time for the relevant ""ceremonies"" at the agents) seems close to implausible.

With small landlords, it's not unusual for the contract to just expire and the tenancy to continue month-to-month anyway.

The first situation is the situation I was in from around 2005 to 2013 - a guarantor for the six months only, afterwards I was the only one signing the renewals. Admittedly I massively overpaid the rent at first as a kind of emergency savings scheme - I actually caused problems because my account was the obvious one for an accountant to defraud. For just over a year I've been in the second situation - a new contract for six months that expired around the end of February, the landlord made some fuss about renewing but never turned up even when I reminded him, so month-to-month since then - though with no guarantor to start with so I don't know if that would have affected anything.

The Asteras game is indication he's adapting to the system? Against a Greek side? I suppose I can't say with certainty absolutely not, but that sample size is very small and very insubstantial. Dembele is along with Paulinho a player who I didn't suspect would survive in Poch's system because as another poster mentioned, despite his passing ability it's just never into the right areas. And sure enough, he's been dropped for a kid who was playing League One six months ago.

What incisive passes has he made? In seven games, he has made *one* created chance that was not finished. One. That's not at all incisive. For comparison sake, Mason has played one less game, against more difficult competition on average, yet has nonetheless quadrupled Dembele's count. 

Don't take this personally as my vitriol is for the player rather than you, but Dembele's smooth and silky style has been pulling the shade over people's eyes for too long now. He's wonderful in the middle third, but contributes absolute jack shit in the final third. He's also tremendously lazy, and very slow both with his recovering as well as with his thinking towards the pass.

* Service history. None? Don't buy it.
* More on service history - Has it been in the garage being repaired more often than it's been ridden? What's wrong with it? Why has it had all this work done to it?
* Super high mileage? I'd be weary.
* It's present condition. How clean is it? Rust? Scratches? Dirty shitty chain? Crappy Chinese tyres rather than good ones? etc. all give you an idea of how it's been treated.
* Is it HPI clear? - Cat D or C write-offs can be a lot cheaper but can later be very hard to sell.
* Price - Why is this bike £1000 cheaper than exactly the same bike in the next listing? Is it written off? Has it been in an accident and not reported? Has it got stolen parts?
* Does the chassis/ engine number match the V5C? No? Ask - Has it had a new engine? Why?

Tips? 

* Don't go for the cheapest bike from the model you want. 
* Don't get a brand new bike as your first one, likelihood you'll bin it anyway. Specially in the wet winter months while you're learning to ride whether your fault or not. Don't let that dissuade you though..
* Ride within your limits - If you do your DAS, don't go out and buy a fucking Fireblade as your first bike. Be sensible now.

Prepare to find a lot of hidden startup costs to motorcycling. 

* It's winter now. Helmet, jacket, gloves, trousers, boots. Depending on what kind of stuff you want to buy it can cost as little as £400 for a full set of cheapy not so great gear or as much as £1000+
* How to keep it safe? Good chain £80
* What if I can't carry my chain everywhere? Disc lock £40
* What do I chain my bike to at home? Ground anchor + accessories £100
* Oh shit, insurance - Depending on where you live and what bike, probably at least £50/pcm",0,1415839774,null,0,false,0,cm0x7mp,t3_2m4pnz,t1_cm0x7mp,t3_2m4pnz,null,1426053746,13,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,13

&gt;___Inside No. 9___ is a [British dark comedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_dark_comedy) [anthology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthology_series) television programme written by [Reece Shearsmith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reece_Shearsmith) and [Steve Pemberton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Pemberton) and produced by the BBC. The first series was broadcast between 5 February and 12 March 2014 on [BBC Two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Two), and a second series has been commissioned. Each half-hour episode is a self-contained story with new characters and a new setting, and all star at least one (usually both) of Pemberton and Shearsmith. Aside from the writers, each episode has a new cast, allowing *Inside No. 9* to attract a number of well-known actors. The stories are linked only by the fact that each takes place at a number 9, whether this is a suburban house, a gothic mansion or a dressing room. Pemberton and Shearsmith took inspiration for *Inside No. 9* from an episode of *[Psychoville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoville)*, a previous project, which was filmed in a single room. This episode was, in turn, inspired by [Alfred Hitchcock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock)'s *[Rope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(film\))*. *Inside No. 9* was also a reaction to *Psychoville*, which featured a long overarching story realised over multiple series.

In my experience the younger generation get a bad deal and are good for money my generation wouldn't have been. You're mainly paying the bills for my parents and grandparents generations, but my generation is the last one that agreed to pay that bill but hasn't. Your generation seems to be pushed into that, but you really should look closely at the APR.

Within my generation - there's a friend who's been a guarantor and regretted it and I know both parties. They're actually friends again and I don't know enough to judge whether that's sane or not, but I do know absolutely that friendships (and family) get very complicated (or worse, very simply over) when money goes wrong. It's not the money exactly - it's what people think it implies about priorities. Most people will think you placed a few extra piss-ups or similar over their friendship. It's amazingly difficult to accept that someone else has impossible circumstances when you're paying the price.
