The ability to have our affairs ran by a government that fairly represents the population of Scotland. I don't care if it's left/right or monster raving. The Holyrood system is simply much better at putting together a government that people actually voted for.

15% of Scotland voted Conservative.

1% of Scottish MP's are Conservative.

36% of the UK voted Conservative.

*46*% of MP's in Westminster are Conservative.

You can repeat it for any party you like, Green's 1% vote but 0.1% MP's for example, none of the numbers actually match up. Party's get a different level of influence than the voting public actually chose to give them. It causes people to vote for someone they don't want just to counter the power of the party they *really* don't want. Is that democracy?  

Contrast with Holyrood, where the Conservatives got 14% of the vote and earned 12% of the MSP's. Where a third party actually got power because people didn't just do absurd defensive voting.

The UK is currently one of the only major players opposing this idea of a more federal Europe and our bargaining position will be much weaker in the long run as separate countries.

I'm guessing he has already appealed? If so he should have copies of the MAN (Mandatory activity notification) and he also needs to request a copy of the WP08 (this is what Avanta sends to the jobcentre and lists the reasons why he should be sanctioned, you're legally entitled to get a copy of that).

With those he needs to get himself down to the CAB early in the morning (they're generally all booked out of appointments within 30 minutes of their doors opening, it's a good idea to get there before it opens) and they'll look further into it and give him help on where he can go to next.

Meanwhile he can claim for hardship payments at the jobcentre itself, works out to be around 40% of your JSA.

If he just outright refused to attend Avanta after appointment letters were sent out, regardless of how useless that lot are (and believe me, I know first hand what they can be like), then it's looking very likely that the sanction will stand.  

Still, get him to the citizens advice bureau, he's already left it too long by the sounds of it with the ""eventually he went back to the jobcentre"". Delaying things are just making matters worse for himself.

Which realllllllly backfired on him, considering we played Real Madrid not to long after he said this. 

I don't know if you watched the game, but to me IMHO it seemed as if some of Ronaldo's closer friends (Marcelo, Ronaldo himself, and Sergio Ramos to name a few) took Mourinho's comments to heart and set a personal vendetta against us. We played as if it was a pre-season match, they played as if they wanted blood drawn from Mourinho. 

They were pretty aggressive on the pitch and were sure to [talk shit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeDp27Tjq3M#t=110) directed towards the bench (99.9% percent sure it was aimed at Mourinho). In the video you see Ronaldo say ""For you"" with a smerk on his face, and also see him point to himself all of which directed at the Chelsea bench. Marcelo also has a few words directed at the Chelsea bench (not in video too). 

Clearly Ronaldo took that statement to heart, and [this Post-match interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIpE20l2AtA) really made that theory clear. He doesn't say much about the incident itself, but it's easy to tell by his facial expression alone that he was pretty fucking pissed off by what he said. 

I'm a hugeee Ronaldo fan, but it's never going to happen because of Mourinho's comments.

**TL;DR** Mourinho referred to Cristiano Ronaldo as ""not the real Ronaldo"" which pissed him off. Which probably won't make him want to join Chelsea.

A little older, I remember going on a family holiday to Scotland in the early 00s and I just thought of it as a distant part of my country. The locals had different accents but I still saw it as my country. 

More recently I visited Scotland for the Fringe (2012 and 2013) and before going I was slightly worried. I have definite southern accent which some would describe as close to RP - something I thought might be a problem. I'd heard of A.B.E., I'd heard of devolution and the independence movement. I was worried I'd be seen as an outsider and disliked by the local population.
Thankfully my experience in Edinburgh couldn't have been more different. Everyone was fine and even the locals I chatted to seemed to have pretty chill views on independence when the topic was brought up. Having said that, this was Edinburgh and it was during the Fringe.

A year later and I'm back in the far South-West. I see your two fish-themed politicians on TV - Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon - every fucking day and I begin to feel that I'd be unwelcome. An foreign occupier. I know that my family feel the same.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"&gt; public spending per head of population in Scotland is materially higher than in the rest of the UK, despite income per capita in Scotland being broadly in line with the rest of the UK. Scotland currently receives significant fiscal transfers from the rest of the UK and, given that it has an older demographic profile than the rest of the UK, the size of the net transfers from the rest of the UK to Scotland is likely to increase over time.

It's worth pointing out that this higher spending relative to the UK has been balanced out by oil revenues, but also that this is only a recent occurrence (last ten years or so) associated with the high oil prices and high volume production. This fluctuates greatly, and has dropped off in the last few years [[1](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-26326117)].

Scotland on average spends about £1,400 more per head than the UK population in general, and pays in tax about £800 less [[2](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/comment/are-the-scots-really-sucking-up-a-massive-subsidy-9723797.html)]. Over a population of 5.5 million, that means fiscal transfers of over £10bn a year.

You can compare that figure to the yearly North Sea oil and gas revenues over the past thirty years [at the previous link](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-26326117). Revenues have been over £10bn, for instance 2008/09 and 2011/12, but they were only a quarter of that 15 years ago, and have only been £5-6bn over the last three years (estimated figures for 2013/14 [here](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/19/salmond-spending-north-sea-oil-tax-estimate-budget)).

And this is all necessary only to get Scotland to the same level of deficit as the rest of the UK, you then still ultimately need either increased tax revenues (through increased taxes or high long-term growth), or spending cuts, to get to an actual surplus, as we are all currently finding out. You can always say that austerity has choked off growth, but ultimately nowhere in Europe has managed to come through without serious problems. Stimulus is something that works through combined action across large markets, an independent Scotland wouldn't be able to magic a stimulus-led way out of the crisis any more than any other country in Europe.",0,1410390447,null,0,1410390936,0,ckeu1ir,t3_2g146p,t1_ckeu1ir,t1_ckeqlf1,null,1427083083,22,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,22

This is a totally false statement. Looking at recent official (i.e. government-sanctioned) referendums on independence, Puerto Rico (2012) and South Sudan (2011) both required 50% thresholds. As did East Timor (1999) and Quebec (1995). Montenegro (2006) is an exception - the requirement there was 55% however.

Looking back at past referendums in the UK, every single one ever held has required just a simple majority, with the exception of the Scottish devolution referendum in 1979 which additionally asked for 40% of the electorate to vote yes.

So the reason why is a) because most other countries do it and b) to be in line with nearly every other referendum we have ever had.

and even our own species of [onion](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/8051717.stm)

After WW2 an attempt was made to align borders with ethnic group/language (with obvious exceptions), but are we seeing a shift to a narrower regional identity? Will we next see Northern England, Bavaria, Southern France, and Southern Italy demand self-determination, fed up with being dominated by a state with which they share a language but not the same culture?

If all of Europe fragments peacefully into smaller states within the European Union I could see this as a beneficial turn of events, but it's hard to see that as a likely outcome.

Basically its about his passing. 

Your point about Allen being tenacious is completely correct. But i notice breaking up play is a job that is more laid on Henderson and Allen/Coutinho more than Gerrard. Dealing with long balls, keeping the game in front of him and starting a move is much more Gerrards task. Lucas does have a ridiculously high percentage of balls won in the air, and does keep the game in front of him, but can't find a pass like Gerrard still can. I have no stats to back it up but i can't see Allen's ariel statistics being high and he also likes to get forward too much for my liking of someone in that position. 

Emre Can for me is the most likely ""replacement"" for Gerrard. He looks like he can pick a pass, both long and short. He is defensive minded and looks quite astute in his positioning and reads the game well enough do deal with long balls. He is exciting because he's so young and has the potential. He's a bit raw and over zealous at the min, but that will disappear with experience and maturity.

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"I think you're making two different arguments there. Your first one is about sovereignty, and your second is about politics. 

Sovereignty is something you can't really argue against. If the people of Scotland want to be independent and autonomous because they don't want to be governed by people they see as foreign and inherently different to themselves, then fair enough. I don't necessarily agree, but there is historical and recent examples of this, and examples of people who feel inherently different being forced together leading to disaster (like Yugoslavia), so I can somewhat agree with the idea of fighting for independence due to wanting sovereignty. 

Politics is something you can definitely argue against. Plenty of people dislike the current government, and dislike their policies. However, with all governments, things ebb and flow, and, like before 2010, there will come another government who Scottish people prefer more. The politics argument is as much an argument for Scottish independence as it is for Dudley North independence. I don't think disliking the current governments policies is a reason to want to leave the Union.

From what I've seen, it seems a lot of the Yes vote campaigning has focussed very much on politics. It seems as much a vote against the Tories as it does a vote against Union, and it seems no coincidence that independence support became popular during a Tory government and recession, and not when the option for independence first became available (like what happened in Czechoslovakia, or Yugoslavia, or East Timor). If Scottish people will be worse off independent than under the Tories, and one of their main campaigning methods is complaining about life under the Tories, it is very much relevant to talk about these economic issues.

If he doesn't act more right wing his party will split and the Conservatives will lose their historic edge. 

The centre left vote is split between the 'socialist' left and the liberal left both pretty central at this point as Labour has abandoned its former values. The centre right vote has only one candidate because the Tory ideology has tried to fuse authoritarianism and liberal economics thus enabling them to attract the business people and the social conservatives - groups who should fundamentally disagree with each other. One doesn't want government interference and the other wants the government to interfere in most aspects of society to maintain the social hierarchy and order. Philosophically they are not the same but they agree that their own personal space (whether that their wealth or their status or traditional values) should not be touched. While the Tories are pretty consistent on the first point the party post-Thatcher has been primarily fiscally conservative and has moved with the times socially on things like gay marriage etc. As such there has been no socially conservative party to vote for except the BNP which for good reason is a PR disaster. UKIP is slightly less fiscally conservative but very socially conservative giving an out for those unhappy Tory voters who care less about responsible spending but would rather the money was spent on culturally and socially traditional things (not recent immigrants, non-Christians or non-national projects). As far as I can tell this is a rift that has always existed in the Tory party but is only arising now because they have a generally popular hobby horse (the EU) and the alternative is there. As such it is not reversible and Cameron can't go back nor will UKIP disappear after the election in 2015 or the referendum in 2017 (unfortunately). If they are clever after they lose the EU referendum they will reform themselves as the socially conservative alternative to the Tories attracting a unique alliance of aristocrats (from the Tories) and the nationalist working class (most of whom will come from Labour). He's fighting a losing battle and potentially the Tories will run on a purely fiscal manifesto in 2020 and dump the socially authoritarian parts potentially highlighting some libertarian elements. 

Either that or they descent into in-fighting and name calling and politics loses all meaning leading to total gridlock in parliament, a bitter 2020 election involving several riots and then, after a poorly judged assassination attempt on Lord Farage of Cheshire and the subsequent public execution of General Danny Alexander, to a military coup in 2035 led by Prince George Alexander Louis of Cambridge (whom the public greatly admires because of his brave service in the in 2033 conflict in Slovakia and Poland pushing back the continuing Putinist advance through Europe) and we revert to an absolute monarchy again.

true,FezojT,null,null,"Despite the name, I wouldn't say there is much of a distinct Celtic identity. We are as much descended from vikings, angles and saxons as we are from Brythonic people, and the Cumbric language died out around the 12th century I think. Remnants may remain in a few words in the more rural Cumbrian dialect (sheep counting numerals most famously), but I think Norse influences are more pronounced on things like place names and local words. I know, for example, that the word for stream (beck) comes from the old Norse bekkr. Or that the name of an exposed area of grassy high ground (fell) is similar to the Icelandic word for mountain (fjall). Most of the notion of a separate Cumbrian identity is evident in place names and [the stories behind them](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunmail).

But while I would like to say there's a distinct identity since the area has such a rich/ancient history, that would mostly be a fabrication. Cumbrians are predominantly working class folk who live near the country and can talk a bit funny, but still in English. That's about the extent of Cumbrian identity I feel. 
 
Cumbria itself is a bit of a fabrication; I'm from an area that is traditionally a part of Lancashire, Westmoreland takes up a third and Cumberland the rest. Certainly in my area of the county integration with the north west would seem quite normal. The people who are really isolated are on the west coast (Workington and Whitehaven). Perhaps someone from Carlisle would feel like integration with the North East would be easier, I don't know. 

Yeah, Liverpool and Manchester are fucking miles away, but so is everywhere. I'm from the second biggest town in the county, and the biggest (Carlisle) is at the opposite end. The closest places that I would consider ""out"" from here (somewhere with connections to the rest of civilisation) would be Lancaster (about 1 hour by car) and then Preston, which is probably where the typical north-western urban sprawl starts. Manchester's about 2 hours away (these times can be longer with trains), and is probably the closest big city to us.

I really hope that in the aftermath, the big shining thing that remains is the knowledge that meaningful politics is quite exciting. That people can become engaged about that, and politicians actually do have to concern themselves with the electorate.

This isn't about the Scottish or the English, the Welsh, the Irish, the Cornish, and certainly not the wars between us that the media would love to whip up. It's about people wanting the best for themselves, each other, their communities, their region, their countries, the Isles as a whole, and so on.  

It's about people actually having a say in what happens to them. I hope that remembering that is the fall out. But I lived through the Miners' Strike.  I know that the reality is blame will be apportioned to stave off any thoughts of proper democracy, and that will be the end of that.

Looking into history until about 1980 or so about 1/3 of constituencies in Scotland voted Tory.  

EDIT: [This website is better and more interesting](http://www.labourhame.com/archives/3905):

&gt;The table shows:

&gt;8 elections when the electorates of Scotland and England voted the same (1945, 1950, 1955, 1959, 1966, Oct 1974, 1997, 2001) and got the governments each wished (6 Labour and 2 Tory)
 

&gt;* 5 elections when the Scottish electorate prevented the outcome that England had voted for:

&gt;1 election when more people in England voted Labour but got a Tory government Scotland voted for (1951); 

&gt;3 elections when more people voted Tory in England but got the Labour government Scotland voted for ( 1964, Feb 1974, 2005); and

&gt;1 election when Scotland prevented  Tories from getting the overall majority which was voted for by the English electorate (in 2010).
 

&gt;* In the 5 remaining elections, English voters prevented the outcome that Scotland voted for: in 1970, 1979, 1983, 1987, and 1992. In all of these, Scotland voted Labour but gt the Tory government for which England had voted.
 

&gt;* In the 7 elections from 1945 to 1966, the Scottish voters always had the government which they voted for, including 2 (1951 and 1964) when these were not those for which the English electorate had voted.
 

&gt;* Other then 1970, all of the instances of Scotland voting Labour and getting the Tories were in the Thatcher and Major years.  Interestingly, if support for independence is strong in the age group 40 to 50, this may be because these were the people who had most to complain about in these elections.
 

&gt;* Since 1992, Scotland has twice voted with England to produce Labour governments, once voted for a Labour government that English voters did not want; and once stopped the Tories getting an overall majority.

HOW IS THAT CHEAPER???

Also the study that came up with these numbers that wiki relies on a number of assumptions:

1. the wind turbines are generating energy 16 hours a day.

2. They collect 100% of the energy they can (no time taken for the head to turn or energy used)

3. They never break down

4. They are never shut off due to winds being too strong (study relies on average wind speed).

5. They paid no rent to landowners (in the uk it's £5000 per turbine per year)

Also seeing as most people who want these are greenies (not that theirs anything wrong with that) I find it mind-boggling that more energy goes into building, transport and construction of each turbine than they ever produce (assuming 25 year production)

Construction is the act of building or putting together. NOT the material production, maintenance, transport and a number of other costs.

That’s because I will always have an extra man. It starts with Makelele, who is between the lines. If nobody comes to him, he can see the whole pitch and has time. If he gets closed down it means one of the two other central midfielders is open. If they are closed down and the other team’s wingers come inside to help, it means there is space now for us on the flank, either for our own wingers or for our full-backs. There is nothing a pure 4-4-2 can do to stop things”.

After some event that would cause the Doctor to regenerate, he stumbles in to the TARDIS and closes the door, the camera stays on the outside of the TARDIS door where you can see the light from the regeneration energy through the windows. It stops, and the TARDIS dematerializes, and you hear the familiar sound as the familiar time tunnel at the end of each episode in the current series appears with the Doctor Who logo, and then the credits begin to roll. The show can live on, the doctor can continue his adventure, and the show can come back at any time. 

I would seriously be pissed if they just completely put a stamp on it as a definitive ending, as I feel like Doctor Who and Star Trek kind of encompass the same type of optimistic side of Sci Fi. The doctor completely being killed and dying forever would put a definitive and depressing end on it. The last scene I described above may feel overly obvious for a final scene but I honestly feel like that's the best way it could end. It's optimistic, and leaves the door open.

Self Explanatory.

&gt; We believe deposit flight is both highly likely and highly problematic (with banks assets of 12x GDP)

People and organisations (like large companies) will withdraw money held in Scottish accounts to protect it from suddenly being on unknown soil or in an uncertain currency. I think with 'Bank Assets 12x GDP' waht they mean is that the total value of money held by banks is 12 times the Scottish Economic output. Significant withdrawals would hurt that ratio badly, leaving Scotland vulnerable.

&gt; should the Bank of England move to guarantee Scottish deposits, we expect it to extract a high fiscal and regulatory price (probably insisting on a primary budget surplus). 

If the UK financially backs Scottish banks post independence, they would demand stiff economic restrictions including demanding that Scotland spends less than it earns.

&gt; The re-domiciling of the financial sector and UK public service jobs, as well as a legal dispute over North Sea oil, would further accelerate any downturn. 

Banks and financial institutions will leave for more stable shores, the UK will recall UK paid workers and there will be long arguments over how the Oil money will be divided between nations - all of which is bad for a fledgling Scotland.

&gt; In our opinion, as North Sea oil production slows, we estimate that the non-oil economy would need a 10% to 20% devaluation to restore competitiveness. This would require a 5% to 10% fall in wages, driven by a steep rise in unemployment.

The police wouldn't be in on it IMO since he only deals with certain people.

Moffat is misleading you with this major red herring and my understanding is correct because he lied about it.

This whole Moffat Lies chestnut is based on a false understanding of mystery writing. Mystery writing follows one simple rule. The reveal is always something obvious and it's telegraphed well in advanced. It is not some random detail in the background, two characters with similar attitudes, or the fact that one name is a palindrome of another person's name. Those are not clues to prove a theory.

true,bairy,uk,Birmingham,"You are quite correct, it really isn't that bad.

For something knocked up 150 years ago when 25 mph was considered exotic, we can now easily handle 75 - 125mph in many parts of the country. This is often faster than driving if the stations are near where you need to go - and there's the PlusBus scheme if they aren't. It's also worth noting that many european countries have purpose built fast and super efficient railways, whereas we have victorian era and duct tape. Of course some of them can be cheaper.

The fares are a little more than just a number.

Advances can be very cheap, Anytimes vary on distance but can be pretty hefty. Off peak times are okay, peak aren't.

Assuming you're lucky enough to avoid overcrowding you can usually get a seat where you can read a book, do some work, play rayman on your phone. And generally it's faster than a car and the times are reliable +/- 10 minutes. Again that does depend where the station is compared to your source and destination. In return you may have to pay a little more than petrol costs but you don't have to drive or worry about car wear and tear so... it's a case of weighing it up.

Having said that I can understand how much of a sting it is being charged many £10s and these numbers add up fast.

&gt;

&gt;The __Eternals__ are a race of cosmic beings first introduced in the *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)* TV adventure *[Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_(Doctor_Who\))*. One Eternal who called himself Striker explained to [the Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who\)) that he and his people lived outside of time, in the realm of eternity. They considered the mortal inhabitants of the universe to be ""Ephemerals"", even the [Time Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Lord) of the planet [Gallifrey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallifrey). Striker seemed completely unaware of the existence of the Time Lords before meeting the Doctor.

&gt;In the *Enlightenment* serial, the Doctor eventually realized that although the Eternals were powerful enough to manipulate matter, creating objects out of thin air, and read minds effortlessly through telepathy, they lacked imagination and creativity. Thus, they actually depended on ""Ephemerals"" to keep them active and prevent them from withering away in boredom, and without them the Eternals had no purpose; on one occasion the Doctor manages to outwit an Eternal attempt to destroy a rival ship by throwing the explosive off the ship, noting that the Eternals couldn't have accomplished that because they lacked the imagination to think of such an action. This dependence was not something they liked admitting to, however, and they made boasts several times of how they could manipulate the reality around them through sheer force of will. Despite this great power, they deferred to the Guardians of Time, specifically the [White Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Guardian) and the [Black Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Guardian) who offered the Eternals ""enlightenment""- complete knowledge of good and evil- if they won a cosmic race. The Eternals captured many Ephemerals to win the race for them, hence accidentally bringing about the attention of the Doctor who immediately saw them as a threat.

&gt;Although the Eternals were never again seen in the TV series, they have been mentioned in the new TV series that began in 2005. In the episode ""[Army of Ghosts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_of_Ghosts_(Doctor_Who\)),"" the Doctor mentioned the existence of a ""nowhere place"" that exists between parallel universes and alternate timelines, saying that his people called it the [Void](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_planets#Others) while ""the Eternals called it the Howling.""

The third season You Are Not Alone arc came on pretty strong too with Doctor initially lying about his past to Martha, Martha pining for the Doctor, the Doctor falling in love with a human (not Martha), the Doctor constantly mentioning Rose, the Doctor talking about his past on Gallifrey. Even if you don't consider that part of the arc the whole Mr. Saxon mystery was far from subtle.

I mean the DoctorDonna/Four Knocks arcs also came in a bit heavier than usual too. The missing bees, the Adipose planet being lost, Rose appearing and disappearing, and the Pyroville planet being lost back to back was a decent sign post for mystery arc to be solved. Then the Ood episode mentioned about Ten's song ending and DoctorDonna Then they left it out for a bit and came back to it with River amazed to meet Donna, the lost moon of Poosh, Rose appearing and the alternate universe stars going out.

I am pretty sure that they are going to make only passing mentions to the arc plot on Series 8 (like in episode 3) from now on and then in the last couple of episodes ratchet it back up.

true,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;This is one of the most ridiculous statements i've ever read. Yorkshire's economy is nowhere near that of Scotland's.

According to Wikipedia's **[Gross Value Added figures for 2011](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countries_of_the_United_Kingdom_by_GVA_per_capita)** Yorkshires GVA is about 83% of that of Scotland *(exclusive of oil revenues)*.  

Using those figures it comes out at 83% per person and 84% overall.  Not a meaningful difference.

If you stack rank the regions *(still exclusive of oil)* Scotland Comes in fifth out of twelve.  London and the South East are unsurprisingly way ahead of the rest of the country.  The North East, Northern Ireland and Wales all have a GVA of less than £50bn.  

Scotland falls roughly in the middle of the remaining seven *(the East Midlands are a something of an outlier at the lower end)*.  If we restated noir_lord's comment as Scotland being comparable to a large region, rather than a county it would be a reasonably fair statement.

These figures supposedly **[drawn from the ONS figures](http://knoema.com/leezxcb/uk-regional-dataset-april-2013?tsId=1005210)** suggest that GDP per capita in Yorkshire was close to 90% of Scotland's until relatively recently.  Most likely the difference will be mainly trades ancillary to oil and banking.

However, the report is from 2005. And was has the UK government done about it since?


**Nothing.**

Given that, it is perfectly rational for Scotland to leave and steer an autonomous energy policy with an increased use of renewable sources like wind power. And there is no question that BP would not like that.

true,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;Yes exclusive of oil. Oil is a fairly big Scottish resource to ignore when comparing with other areas.

True, but...

Exclusive of oil was the terms of reference you gave.  And, part of the reason I looked it up was because I read your comment and I was curious how the figures actually worked out.

Also, while the oil reserves are clearly a big deal, they're a dwindling reserve.  I know we're not talking about being down to the last few teacups of oil, but the estimates are in the order of a small number of decades.  Worse still, extracting the remaining oil gets harder and harder  *(and therefore more expensive)* as the oil fields are depleted, although it's possible that increases in the price of oil over the next few decades might offset this.

If Scotland becomes an independent country it's not a short term thing.  It's not inconceivable that eventually Scotland might enter into another union.  That said, I think it's reasonable to guess that that wouldn't be likely in the sort of timescale we're talking about.  

It's a little hard to imagine what the world will look like in forty years, but it would be unwise to rely on oil revenues alone.  *(And I appreciate that this isn't the plan as laid out by the Scottish government.)*  So, if you accept that the oil fields are an extraordinarily valuable, but short-term asset it's not wholly unreasonable to look at Scotland's economy exclusive of them.

Capitalism and a free market economy delivers a thriving economy, but that is not what we need.

What we need is an economy that just works, it doesn't need to be huge or very efficient, it doesn't need to employ more people than we have, it doesn't need to produce wealth beyond the needs of a human being.

What we need is to change our measure, economics is not the only measure, it is just the ting that is easiest to measure.

We need to have a society where people feel safe, included and whole.

The constant bombardment of advertising by companies wishing to exploit those needs make us feel unsafe, excluded, and incomplete all in the name of sales and profit.

&gt; The SNP prides itself on the positivity of their election strategies but this only started before the 2007 election following a workshop with the Really Effective Development Company where, amongst other things, they learned about Martin Seligman's research on how it's the most optimistic candidate in American presidential elections who usually wins. According to Paul Hutcheon, the late SNP MSP Brian Adam revealed a bizarre strategy for ensuring candidates remained upbeat: 'We were all presented with a bag of pennies. Every time we said anything negative we had to put a penny in the middle of the table. This was to stop us saying negative things. It was a major change in approach'.
&gt; 
&gt; Noon's approach is nationalism laced with a heavy dose of what looks like whacky personal development philosophy. One of REDCO's 'Red Tens' is 'Invent your own virtual reality'. I have no problem with these mind games when it comes to sports or other performances but how appropriate are they for political leaders? Indeed I suspect that the use of these 'power of the mind' approaches helps explain why senior Yes people set out their agenda for Scotland and then simply expect the rest of the world to comply. Indeed they don't even acknowledge that others (e.g. rUk or EU member states) may have their own agendas or interests as they are only focused on their own.

This is probably true. The pathetic part of which is that I have a paper in front of me quoting David Cameron as saying that he'll, 'be heart-broken if Scotland votes to break up the British family'.

I would guess that about half the people who will vote Yes would see Dave's crocodile tears and point out that he was the guy in charge when a binary Yes No vote was imposed.

&gt;Given the market panic in the last week I can't see Yes winning now.

I'm not convinced on that.

Firstly, the farcical nothing pre-negotiated way we went about this means everyone has had free rein to claim anything they fancy is what will happen. Even the relatively well informed can't see what will happen.

*(My personal guess is a 3-4% Yes majority followed by negotiations where both sides act completely unreasonably.  (Scotland threatening to walk away from the debt. rUK threatening to keep all the oil fields, or refuse Scotland a share of other assets.) I can see eighteen months of acrimonious 'negotiation' where both sides blame the other side. Possibly resulting in Scotland saying that rUK has made independence impossible and negotiating toward full or near full devolution.)*

Agreed. I just think the government and political parties have shot themselves in the foot by not helping expedite the devolution process in the last couple of years, and now are promising greater powers (etc, etc) with only mere days to go. Those who are in the Yes camp will surely only see it as either a knee-jerk reaction or a move being made out of desperation, and not be swayed by it. It sort of feels like they're dangling a carrot in front of the donkey except this time the donkey isn't going to be fooled. 

Like you I think it'll be an extremely sad day if the UK is split up and I do feel slightly resentful that the rest of the UK has no say in it, given that it's a partnership in that both the rest of the UK and Scotland benefit each other.

Independent Scotland would not be part of the EU and could therefore sell gas/oil in the same way the US does i.e. into the domestic market at next to nothing, massively reducing energy costs? 

This is more less what's 'saved' the US economy? 

Scotland can use whichever currency it wants and no one can stop it, this would result in a loss of control over things like interest rates?

Once independence is 'bedded in' Scotland could re-gain that control by creating it's own currency? 

Scotland could lower tax rates making it very competitive within the UK and wider European area?

'Peak Oil' never actually happened? Increasing global prices have made formerly overly expensive fields economic.

In this case, yup. 

Or let me challenge you to show that...

...scorning homosexuality amongst consenting adults - making villians or criminals of them - offering them electric shock treatment or even killing them...

...is better for their well-being than leaving them the hell alone to do what they like? 

&gt; Interesting. So you believe you were born in the ""right culture""? That's confirmation bias right there, ain't it!

I know that I've not been persecuted for being who I am and that here in the UK we have one of the most accepting cultures in the world (hell, it's forced upon us for better or worse - but we're incredibly accepting as a people which is why we have such a mix of people living here). 

Furthermore my culture has grown up from persecuting homosexuals and now allows their union - that's progress. 

My culture doesn't stone people or lock them up for being a particular colour, sex, religion or creed. 

With respect to this topic, *their* culture is to persecute, scorn and treat homosexuality with electric shocks. That's barbaric. 

Sorry, whoever you are, but if you're trying to prove anything about me then you should really start from a better moral high ground than that.

The last two Chancellors have been too (Darling and Brown again). For 13 years before 2010, the UK was ruled by the same party that won a majority in Scotland. While it is true that the current government is lead by the Tories, they distinctly failed to win a majority- and are in coalition with the Lib Dems, who have some 19% of the Scottish Westminster seats.

#Government balance of income

First of all, the economic argument is a difficult one because there are so many factors involved in the exchange of money to/from the royal family and it's unknown just how the royal assets would be split in the event of dissolving the monarchy. Sure, if they keep everything owned under the crown as personal property, that would probably be a loss, but why should that happen? Furthermore, who's to say that what is recovered in property and other taxes won't make up for it? They would be taxed progressively just like any other super wealthy citizen.

I don't have a ""fair"" solution (nothing except complete possession will seem fair to a royal family who has owned those assets for generations anyway), but it's impossible to predict what the difference will be without an actual plan in place, which would only happen if people seriously considered this as an option, which I doubt will happen anytime soon, if ever.

#Tourism

I won't assert that tourism would increase but certainly your assertion that successful tourism is somehow predicated on having a royal family seems far fetched to me. I've never known anyone to visit a country with a main purpose being to see their royalty, be it the UK, the UAE, Japan, the Netherlands, Malaysia, Kuwait or any other, although that is obviously purely anecdotal.

Plenty of countries get huge amounts of tourism income from formerly royal/imperial artefacts and buildings, France and China just to name a couple. In fact, it may open up more attractions since many properties may no longer be private property (depending how the assets are split obviously).

#Legal purpose and influence

&gt;she cant issue laws or remove them without it first going through parliament

I see that as an argument against a royal family, since they have no legal purpose. *Not* having them around would make no difference in terms of passing laws, so why have the added complexity of requiring their token approval?

&gt;her opinion is respected

Why? Why should her opinion be any more respected than my opinion or the opinion of anyone else on the street? Is she a qualified expert in a subject? No. The only reason anyone cares what a royal says or does is that they are royal and that's it. Then how is their opinion anymore valid or worthy than any other TV celeb? At least the TV celeb needed to work hard or have some talent of some sort to become a celeb, not just pop out of the right womb.

#Basic principles

&gt;some people dont like the idea we live in a monarchy, they want to live in a republic, despite that its really just a label and will make no difference in our lives

To me, this is the most important factor of all. It doesn't matter if they give more money than they take from the government (Many of us do too!). It doesn't matter if they're a really good tourist attraction (My university is no longer royal, yet still a huge tourist attraction). It doesn't matter if the current Queen has not done anything terrible to the country simply by not really doing anything at all or that she overall seems a very nice lady (I agree on that point that she seems like a really nice person, but who's to say the next one will be the same?). You say it's just a label, but I say that their very existence is a *symbol* of extreme inequality and our tacit acceptance of it. In this day and age, while we talk about the wealth gap increasing and a return of the class system, how can we continue to support a monarchy that is the very pinnacle of inequality in wealth and class?

Furthermore, one could argue that they have become a bit of a PR tool of the ""ruling class"". Economic depression and terrible unemployment issues? *Oh look it's an adorable royal baby! Have a bank holiday, forget the country's problems and let's all unite behind nationalism and the union flag!*  
I am extremely wary of nationalism and how it is used as a tool to gain popularity by politicians and distract the public from serious domestic issues. The royal family frequently seems to be used, whether deliberately or inadvertently, as a tool for encouraging nationalism.

Here's the kicker, when you do a bank transfer nothing of value actually gets moved. Rather the banks send each other IOUs through a third party like SWIFT/SEPA/BACS then at the end of the month, they see what the sum of those debts are and the banks negotiate the payment from one to the other using an agreed asset, or go into debt against the bank it's owed to.

If that Scottish bank has had a bank run of £1Bn to English banks and little to none has moved into Scotland, then that bank will have to produce £1Bn of assets to the English banks by the end of the month or take out a loan, or it might eventually collapse if it can't make enough profit to cover the 

If it collapses, the English bank will now have a problem because they are supposed to have your £146k from Scotland, but they never actually received it and now you're an unsecured creditor in their bank, now the English bank collapses and the government has to bail you out, but only up to the FSCS limit of £85k (per firm), meaning you're now £61k out of profit.

true,Kiram,mcgann,McGann,"Moffat and RTD are both very flawed showrunners in their own unique ways. They both have some things I really like: For instance, Moffat has a really cool grasp on some of the little bits of Doctor Who lore, and they get brought up, which is kind of neat. He also seems to have a much better handle on the whole idea of Time Travel. It's not just a method of getting us into outerspace, or medieval Venice. It feels like the time travel is actually a part of the plot, instead of just the set-up sometimes, and I really enjoy that aspect. (For instance: the girl who waited. Interesting plot involving manipulation of time.)

However, Moffat falls flat when it comes to consistency most of all. While some of his episodes have brilliant character turns for the doctors or their companions, it all feels very insubstantial when the next episode it feels like it never happened. And his running plots are a complete mess, with poorly-handled connectivity, and a feeling like the ending was always rushed. Like Moffat had a huge story arc planned out, but decided to end it 3 seasons early, and wrap everything up in a nice little bow.

The first time I really thought nothing of it, but it happened every season, and the endings were never satisfying! Poor form in general. and that is/was the real issue: generally good ideas, poor execution, or, more importantly, really poor consistency. It's hard to get a feel for character intereaction when it changes so often, and everything that happens feels so damned insubstantial, because there is this constant niggling feeling that nobody really knows what's going on, Moffat included.

____________________________________________

Now, that's not to say that RTD is better, he's just different. On the whole, RTD's stories tended to be a lot more consistent, but also a lot less daring. Almost all of his stories were monster-of-the-week affairs, and while I agree that Doctor Who is definitely missing good monster-of-the-week episodes lately, I never felt that he was trying to do anything spectacular or interesting. He was a very safe writer, and a very predictable one.

I mean, honestly, how many times were we going to see the exact same series finale before it got old? Everyone sing along: The doctor faces off against suddenly-revealed-to-still-exist old enemies that he/we thought had all been wiped out (Daleks/Cybermen&amp;Daleks/The Master/Daleks *again*/The Time Lords), for a 2 (or 3) part episode!

All in all, he was a much more consistent writer, but his consistency was almost to a fault, and he never really tried much that felt new. He never really tried for an over-arching story, just dropped ""hints"" about the season finale baddie that only make sense when you watch them the second time. And as much as I *adore* his companions, I really don't want to see Rose pop up for a *fourth* time and declare her love for the doctor all over again. It really did feel like he was completely unable to let that one go.

______________________________________________________

Ultimately, I find RTD's track record to be stronger. More of his episodes were good, in my estimation, than Moffat's, but I don't think it's because he's a better showrunner. I think that Moffat is trying new things and they aren't working, but it's interesting to watch him try and fail, and I think he's starting to figure out his middle ground. The first few episodes of Series 8 have felt less strong than his best, but overall far more consistent than any other series he's helmed so far.

But more importantly, once he steps down as showrunner, I'm going to be glad he had the time that he did, because whoever comes next is going to have some amazing experiments to work with, far more than they did with RTD's era.",0,1410426922,null,0,false,0,ckf71d6,t3_2g2v9y,t1_ckf71d6,t3_2g2v9y,null,1427075863,31,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,31

You're wrong.

Totally wrong.

We could all be right.

Together.

true,CrashingAnalyst,eng-gloucestershire,Cheltenham,"Generally in our parliamentary system you have large swings, so every few elections you get a big jump of 40-50 'close' seats from red to blue, or vice versa, which delivers a 100 seat difference in parliament.

The popular vote doesn't really change massively (+/- 10%) but because of the way MPs are elected (1 extra vote = 2 seat differential) it amplifies changes in the popular voting in parliament.

Here you go:

http://www.politicsresources.net/area/uk/percentvote.htm

Note the second chart. What does this mean for Scotland? Scotland holds 59 seats in parliament or 9%, so assuming that Scotland always votes exactly the same way (e.g. 100% vote for labour, no vote for SNP) the rUK seat differential has to be greater than 9% to overcome the Scotland effect.

In every single election since 1966 there has been a greater than 9% seat differential, meaning that you could completely remove all of Scotlands votes and you would have the same government.

Of course, it's possible to have close elections... but just because of the way parliament works we to tend to have majority governments, when a 5% switch in the opinion polls flips 50 marginals which delivers a 100 seat difference.

I just went on here : http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/swing-calculator took 5% off tories and added 5% to lab, ended up with a swing of 136 seats. 34.7% of the vote would deliver labour an outright majority in parliament, with 88 more seats than the tories (again, more than the 59 seats Scotland could contribute).

I think about the entire industry disagrees with you there

&gt; he doesn’t do well with big story arcs

See, I loved the exploding Tardis/cracks in time stuff, all the little hints we got.

&gt; Now this is all opinion, very biased opinion at that

Well here's mine: I didn't like Doctor Who during RTD, there were some really good episodes (like Midnight,  Blink, ...) that made me sit through the bad ones (Love &amp; Monsters, Aliens of London, ...), but overall, I wouldn't recommend the show to my worst enemy.  When Moffat took over, most episodes became enjoyable, they weren't all good, but overall, it was a huge improvement. Less cringe, more laughs.

The *no* side made up some bollocks about our neutrality being at stake, so we were given written guarantees that we wouldn't have to participate in the Rapid Reaction Force. This was not small print.

The major issues identified with the first referendum were that military unit and the unreadable nature of the text. According to the Irish Times poll afterwards, 40% of people voting no said they did so because they didn't understand what it was about. Libertas, a US neocon group, used this to their advantage and proclaimed that it legalised everything from euthanasia to gay marriage. While most Irish people didn't fall for their shit, it did belie how the Irish electorate did not understand what was being proposed and so, in a way, they voted correctly.

The second referendum was made with written assurances was won with a 65% majority. The swing was 20%. Much of that is attributed to far better campaigning and illustration of what the treaty was actually about by the government. On top of that, to reiterate, the EC agreed that (to blockquote wiki, as I can't be bothered arguing this stuff again years later):

&gt; the necessary legal guarantees would be given that nothing in the Treaty of Lisbon made any change of any kind to the Union's competences on taxation for any member state;[73]

&gt; the necessary legal guarantees would be given that the Treaty of Lisbon did not prejudice the security and defence policy of any member state, including Ireland's traditional policy of neutrality;[73]

&gt; the necessary legal guarantees would be given that neither the Treaty of Lisbon (including the Justice and Home Affairs provisions), nor the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, affected the provisions of the Irish Constitution in relation to the right to life, education and the family in any way;[73]

&gt; in accordance with the necessary legal procedures, a Decision would be taken to retain Ireland's Commissioner, provided that the Treaty of Lisbon was ratified;[73]

&gt; the high importance attached to issues including workers' rights would be confirmed.[73]

&gt; The Irish Government then committed to seeking ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon by the end of the term of the current European Commission[73] (October 2009), provided that the above were implemented satisfactorily.[73]

Note of course that Ireland was one of very few countries that voted on this treaty at all, and the only one to get assurances like this. To then flippantly say that it was 'until they get the answer they want' or that the changes made were insignificant is pretty insulting to the Irish people.

That's why they are doing it. They don't consider a future scotish state to be able to act as a reliable lender of last resort given the currently farsical demands for a currency union that would prevent it from acting as so. You need to be able to issue currency in order to be able to do that, currency union precludes this and so they want to be within the same jurisdiction as the bank of england.

true,thecosmicpope,scot-Angus,Angus,"So what your saying is, RBS are scared that if they fail yet again, they need such a massive amount of money to fix it, that they'll move to England? As a Scot...I have no problem with this. If you want to prop up banks like that then on you go. RBS have already released a letter saying that the move will not impact on jobs, services or customers, so it has no negative effect on Scotland.

Independence may be a bad idea on economic ground (but for every upvoted article here saying that, there is an upvoted article elsewhere saying the opposite), but there is a LOT more to do with this vote than economics, and trying to somehow dumb it all down to the money side of things just belittles everything that has been discussed over the past 2 years. And England wasn't particularly interested in what was said for 2 years, and this week has woken up like its 10 minutes late for the bus and has started rushing round frantically trying to be on time for it.

You're of course correct that where the company is legally registered is not where it is based. A good example is that I own a Windows Phone  and when I buy an App I get an email from Microsoft Luxembourg. However, this makes no difference to me, the end customer. And since RBS and Llyods have said there will be no impact on services, I'm going to suggest that these massive front page announcements made by the BBC declaring that banks will leave Scotland are just what I said - scare mongering.

So if you'd like to take on the responsibility of managing banks, which have proven completely incapable of supporting themselves in a safe and grown up manner then on you go. I, as a customer, am not particularly bothered. And should Scotland go independent (which I don't think will happen), and should RBS require another bail out (which I do think will happen), I don't want to hear any complaints about England bailing out Scottish banks after this.

Maybe the banks are scared that they will be regulated properly in an independent Scotland. Where as in the UK, they seem to be allowed to go wild and make utterly ridiculous calls which we've all had to fix by giving our tax money to them so they won't collapse. Maybe the fact that the banks are getting away with anything they want is too good a thing for them to leave behind, and they'd rather be in England and have the get-out-of-jail-free cards, where as Scotland is currently an known quantity.",0,1410432451,null,0,false,0,ckf8011,t3_2g38wg,t1_ckf8011,t1_ckf7trf,null,1427075352,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

I am against playing at someplace like Brighton simply because it pulls us out of London. But to be perfectly fair.....the Amex is REALLY, REALLY nice. It is truly one of the nicer stadiums we have been linked to.

Tough part with being homeless for a season is that when looking for that home there just aren't a great deal of stadiums that would fit the bill in London.  We aren't going to spend a season at the Bridge, Emirates, Boleyn, Loftus, Selhurst, Fulham or (realistically) Wembley.

Right, and what's the problem with this exactly? There are many, many nations smaller than Scotland in every way. They all survive just fine. Yet there seems to be this amazing argument going on that Scotland can't support itself. I've not really seen any evidence on why New Zeland (example country) is fine, and why Scotland won't be.

&gt; Why, all the supplementary questions of social justice and welfare cannot possibly be implemented without a sound economic plan.

So you are going to be boil it down to economics, and anything anyone argues is just going to circle around to the fact Lloyds have going to move their London HQ to...London, an Australian bank will re-register its address, and RBS, which is 80% state owned, will continue to be 80% state owned? 

&gt; It makes a significant different to a ability to tax these commercial entities. Which again, links into the issues of how a budget for things like healthcare and policing is to be set.

Agreed, it does. Nobody is claiming that an independent Scotland will be 100% positive. Not even Alex Salmond has said every single little thing will be better than it would be as part of the UK. Sacrificing poor performing banks for more relevant political representation for the entire nation? Sounds good to me tbh.

I mean this in no offensive way at all, but since this is just going to circle around to economics and scare mongering (which is all this banking stuff has been, especially RBS and Llyods), I will respectfully bow out of this argument.

For one, they have notably different politics, and not just Plaid and the SNP. England is *much* more right wing and the other two home nations. The English edition of national newspapers are markedly more right wing with more racism and homophobia (Scotland, surprisingly, is actually more accepting of gay people, our conservative party is lead by a lesbian for goodness sake), even toward other members of the Home nations (""those lazy Scot's living off English money"", not only not true but kinda racist). You actually have Ghettos, we don't really have that there. We have minorities, sure, but they tend to be a more integrated.

Apart from that, in England people tend to be a bit more reserved. I've had strangers offer me their day tickets after they've finished them in Scotland, in England they're taken aback if you ask them the time. There's a lot more businesses on major trunk roads in the countryside. Like in the middle of nowhere, without a town in sight, you'd see a rather rough looking pub, the type you'd see in a sketchy area of town, but with next to nothing around it, just fields.

Then there's accents. Sure, accent's vary everywhere. But a Scot from Aberdeen can be understood in Glasgow if they speak standard English. I can understand the English accents, but sometimes they'd just not understand what I am saying. I'm not speaking Scots, sometimes I'd find I said ""Aye"" instead of yes, but despite this I have to speak very slowly as if I'm speaking a foreign language.

It is not that (most) people want to be subjugated, but that we are all hardwired to estimate authority in people around us, and adjust our behaviour accordingly.

In that context, a constitutional monarch is a quite easy authority for people to accept and: The Queen is not in a position to mess up peoples lives, yet she presents many trappings of authority (palaces? check; ""uniforms""? check; important title? check; tradition? check; and so on) to make people feel warm and fuzzy about having her as head of state. 

So she gets to be an authority figure by virtue of not having or exercising any real authority to subjugate anyone. 

In that sense it is quite healthy: It's a nice ""hack"" that dilutes the effect of our built in tendency to seek out authority. But we could get the same effect with a figurehead president as head of state too.

But these figures are likely better for players who do most of their running off the ball (because you're faster without it, of course) and those who make a lot of short sprints (because it's hard to maintain high speeds beyond 70m). Downing and Agbonlahor fit both those categories.

See... Anyone who runs 100m in 12s or less is hitting around 20mph or better. Over shorter distances, like the ones footballers are likely to sprint (i.e. 30-60m mostly) it's easier to maintain a high speed, and see better average pace measurements. Even elite sprinters tend to peak at around 50-60m in terms of raw speed. It's hard to maintain it for long beyond that point. But it's also worth noting that elite sprinters are usually only slightly quicker than average sprinters over the first 30m or so because of limitations the human body has while accelerating.

For players like Agbonlahor and Downing, who play close to the opposition defensive line when attacking, and are often sprinting back to do defensive work, it makes sense that they have a larger number of short sprints with explosive starts, to get ahead of the fullback for that through ball, or to overtake the winger they need to help defend against.",0,1410433263,null,0,false,0,ckf85qd,t3_2g0bkx,t1_ckf85qd,t1_ckei5pc,null,1427075279,3,false,avfc,t5_2s569,3

I think mine is 7 k in each? But they keep calling me about it so maybe it has changed?  above this and you can get taxed. 

These are the safest products but returns are piss poor.  

II would say that less than 30k don't lay someone to invest for you.  They won't get you much more without stupid risks.

The plus is that there are some amazing micro (and larger breweries) which have their wares in major supermarkets, Off-licences are increasingly stocking good beer alongside the crates of continental lager and there are still places in London where you can easily get a pint of fantastic stout, porter, pale, IPA or red ale for less than £3.50.

Looking at the paragraph before - it could mean they want you to stop being aware of the conviction of Anton Vickerman.

Because that's what it boils down *to*. It's all well and good if an independent Scotland would be more libertarian than the UK, but it means nothing if we don't have the money to pay for all of these new government supplements.

This is the problem right now with the massive black-hole between the discussion going on in Scotland and the discussion going on in the rest of the UK. It's not your fault, the media has been hopeless at reporting it.

Democracy is not a binary on/off switch AKA family guy. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlIm-riMN6Q

Right now it is very very poor - throughout the UK. Only a few constituencies decide the government we have. There is a very poor representation and the FPTP system has been proven to lead to a two party system chasing a very small number of floating voters.

In England you might be happy with this because at least the government will always at least purport to represent 'your nation'. In Scotland the idea is terrifying. Mainly because the lack of accountability. The possibility exists that we could have a very 'anti scottish' government (think Boris/Farage). Even the POSSIBILITY of this is simply unacceptable in what should be a modern democratic state.

Those players are indeed extraordinarily rare, because there are so many factors that can effect how good a player can become; injury, development, opportunity etc. The prevalence of multiple media platforms and access to hype and gossip means that early hype of young players is very much hit and miss these days.

But it happens. And in pre-ITK Twatter days, if you heard that player's name, you KNEW it was something special. We've been lucky as a club to have seen it several times in recent years, that whisper around the city, the noise and hype growing: ""this lad is going to be fucking amazing"".

Even before they played, everyone knew that Gerrard was going to be a player. That Fowler was one of the greatest finishers the club had ever seen. That this diminutive angelic-looking kid called Michael Owen who looked about 8, was making kids 2 years older look slow and clumsy, while smashing in goals from every angle.

I remember some LFC magazine used to have a cover-mounted video (really) and that was the first time I saw Owen play. A few minutes of grainy highlights from youth games, in which this tiny player in a red shirt scored goal after goal after goal; a deadly little red blur going past defenders like the weren't there, and then scoring with a ridiculous lob over the keeper from miles out, or exocet shot. Hat-trick after hat-trick.

About a year later I was fortunate enough to see him make his debut as a sub against Wimbledon. Playing away at their ground (in fact I think they were sharing with Palace at the time).

We lost 2-1. But Owen scored a typical Owen goal; played through, seared past the defence and calmly slotted it past the keeper. The first of 158.

But Scotland is far too indirect right now. In fact, we currently have the least direct representation in Europe, this leads to a sense of disempowerment which affects us almost palpably.

I like to think of it like this. Certain powers should be delegated as locally as possible. Power should only be centralised if there is a justifiable reason to do so.

true,The_Darknut_Rises,smith,Smith,"I'm going to try and break down how I feel about Moffat and RTD via direct comparison.

**Characters**

The Doctor is always The Doctor regardless of the writer. Companions on the other hand I have to agree with the op. Davies characters had families and lives, Clara started off as a plot point. She seems to be getting more characterisation this series though so that's good.

**Story arcs**

RTD story arcs were rubbish. Every episode ""Badwolf Badwolf Badwolf, what does it mean????!!!!"" we get to the end of the series and it means...well nothing really. The Torchwood arc is explained in the second episode of series 2 yet is still dragged out across the series. The Harold Saxon one was actually alright tbf. Moffats uses story arcs to suddenly spring surprise cliffhangers on you and send you into a frenzy of internet debate. That's what story arcs are supposed to do (at least in my mind).

**Continuity**

Moffat constantly adds little nods (and sometimes fairly in your face nods) to other episodes and nerdy little trinkets for fans to pick up on. As a fan I enjoy this. RTD's first act as scriptwriter was to invent a war so devastating that it effectively wiped out 26 seasons and a movie's worth of continuity. I understand why, if you're going to reboot a show the first series can't spend every episode tying up the lose ends from something which last aired 9 years ago but he very clearly wanted to make Who his own show. Just looked at the ridiculously self-indulgent scene just before Tennant's regeneration where he says one last goodbye to everything RTD has made.

**Monsters**

This is my impression of RTD writing classic enemies into Who: ""You know how the Daleks were completely destroyed for ever? WELL THEY'RE BACK BITCHES! It's alright though because Rose can use the power of the Tardis to wipe them out of time itself so there is no way they can ever appear again (or previously if you think about it, which I clearly haven't). Anyway no more Daleks, but there are CYBERMEN! Who are now exactly like the daleks. 'Delete!' classic catchphrase amirite? What do you mean they've never said that before? What did they say instead of exterminate? Anyway they're stuck on a parallel world now, travel to which is impossible. Have I explained how impossible it is yet? Well imagine something that can't ever happen, it's as impossible as that. Anyway moving IMPOSSIBLE, sorry hadn't quite finished labouring that point. As I was saying THE CYBERMEN ARE BACK! Bet you thought that was impossible as the daleks coming back right? Well the daleks are back too! Back into time where they should immediately be destroyed by last year's finale but lets just gloss over that."" I could go on. For the record I absolutely love Doomsday but you get my point.

Moffat is a lot more reluctant to completely destroy forever something which is obviously going to come back. To me the daleks still being out there makes them seem a lot more of a threat than them constantly trying to outdo themselves in terms of what they want to destroy (the destruction of reality itself? The reason RTD left was probably because even he couldn't think of any way to make the steaks higher than that).

**In conclusion**

I have completely forgotten what point I was trying to make. Probably something about how I quite like Moffat as showrunner even if he doesn't do certain things particularly well.",0,1410436547,null,0,false,0,ckf8vur,t3_2g2v9y,t1_ckf8vur,t3_2g2v9y,null,1427074941,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

If you can't be bothered i'll copy the comments from a redditor on the scotland subreddit. If you want factual news about this. Go there. /r/uk is full of Anti Independence and hate.

&gt; He said Downing Street was to blame for the uncertainty that led to falls in the value of the pound and in the share price of some leading Scottish FTSE 100 companies earlier this week. Those events were triggered by Number 10 confirming on Monday that it had no contingency plans for a yes vote, he claimed, and by the UK government’s “unreasonable” decision no to contemplate a currency union.
&gt; He said it was his “overwhelming belief” that, in the event of a yes vote, Westminster would drop its opposition to a currency union.

true,MrFlabulous,,Glorious People's Republic Of Asbostan,"Some excellent observations, points and questions. Very thought provoking. As such, here are my own opinions on the matter.

We do seem (globally) to be in the grip of some sort of tribalism overall. Globalisation, environmental concerns, the recession and the perception that corporations are running the show have led to various states of unrest, be they religious, nationalistic or whatever. Many governments, and I include the UK in this group, are very centralised and pro-globalisation. This means that they can seem to be driven not by the needs of the people, necessarily, but by private firms and corporations.

Within the UK this view is reinforced by the outsourcing of the NHS to PFIs, the privatisation of several other institutions and the relocation of the industrial sector to the far east or subcontinent where cost savings can be made. OK, I do sound off on this subject more than I care to admit, but this had led to a widespread disaffection towards centralised governments by the nations with higher populations generally.

A socialist plan may not work very well with large or dense populations, I grant you: infrastructure costs too much to maintain and it's all too easy to neglect certain sections of society. However smaller or less-dense nations can manage such a system very well. Sweden is an example that always gets mentioned, having pretty good healthcare and state pensions, bla bla bla...

So the UK, which had a very socialist approach to governance post WW2, found that as the population rapidly expanded (too rapidly, perhaps?) the infrastructure couldn't meet the demands as quickly as needed. So the modern country, with its dated railways, crumbling roads, mismanaged NHS and outdated emergency services, is struggling to cope.

When Thatcher came to power she tried to modernise the country, but recognising that public ownership of many of these services probably wasn't going to work, hence the large-scale privatisation and the fresh round of strikes that went with it. The strikes of the 70's (mostly) were a protest against the archaic working conditions and poor pay, something that the government simply weren't able to deal with. The strikes of the 80's were for the most part anti-privatisation.

So the lingering resentment of my generation has spilled over to the 21st century. It's worth noting at this point that Scots aged between 35 and 55 are more likely to vote yes than no next week. I'm no Scot, but I fall within that age range, so I was witness to many of these events.

So there is a big ""fuck you factor"" as you put it, and with regard to the rest of the UK I'd say that factor is present in many other areas of the country. I daren't comment about NI, but Wales, Cornwall and the north of England *in general* most likely sympathise with the Scots, and while they may not be pushing for independence right now, you can bet your bottom dollar that it's on their minds.

Then there's the likes of me. Lived in Kent for most of my life, in Ramsgate (Thanet South) for ten years, probably one of the more deprived areas in the south of England. I have watched businesses close, immigrants arrive and Laura Sandys grimace and gurn for the local paper. No wonder the Kippers feel like this is a seat to win. The whole of the South East now provides London with her manpower and consumer spending. We get HS1 and new housing, we even get our own dialect: ""Estuary English"". I commuted up to London for 3 years to work at Imperial College and became depressed at the resources London seemed to suck away from everywhere else like the glutton at a christmas table, while other parts of the country picked sadly at what was left of the carcass.

Blimey, turned into quite the bitter rant. Sorry.

Anyway, my point is that Westminster has not been looking after the rest of the UK very well, relying instead on local councils and boroughs. Almost like the feudal systems of old. Another example of outdated methods not working in a modern society.

Much has been said about protest votes, how the UKIP bandwagon has gained momentum and how the UK has to become more decentralised, in fact you can't avoid hearing about these matters at all these days! But I guess it's a very real consequence of the mismanagement of the last 40 years. It's very much a contemporary thing, given the circumstances that have led to this moment, but I could make the argument that it's inevitable: the break up of the empire meant that a huge industrial workforce was suddenly left with very little to do.

There are lots of other little moments here and there: the discovery of North Sea oil and the subsequent closure of the pits, our involvement in various international crises, bla bla bla, but I think it fair to say that the UK has a substantial part of the population which, fed up by the failures of Westminster, is turning its back on the process. Some have gone down the apathy route. Some vote UKIP. Some, given the opportunity (i.e. 40-50% of Scotland, depending on the current polls) are about to take the opportunity to do things a little differently.

Britain is probably no different from any other large power (or former power, some might say). Given the geography the British Isles have always tended towards isolationism, but somehow always been dragged in to other affairs. While I think of the public being generally quite liberal-minded there are various traditionalist behaviours in all of us. Don't forget that many people fear, resist or resent change, and the world is certainly changing far quicker than many would like.

I guess there's no easy answer to any of this, and certainly I'm not clever enough to know how to fix things. As I said before, these are my opinions, as such they are probably very wrong. I'm a miserable old bastard with a very one-sided view of the world and my bias towards left-wing radicalism probably doesn't help much either.

Although I am absolutely sure you didn't mean it, it comes across as really condescending to suggest that people in England are OK with the voting system and government. If anything the representation issue is skewed in Scotland's favour thanks to the West Lothian question - the most recent example I can think of was (I believe) NHS foundation hospitals for England and Wales, carried through by a whisker by Scottish MPs.

Equality under the law is also a right everyone should have.  Freedom of religion to terminate where it infringes upon the fundamental rights of others.

That about sums up everything from gay marriage to FGM and the right to privacy.

true,jubbergun,null,null,"Well, there's quite a bit of bad foreshadowing...or at least unfulfilled foreshadowing.  Like River knowing the Doctor's name the first time she meets him, and him saying there's only one reason he'd ever tell anyone his name...but we still haven't actually seen that happen.  The Silence narrative goes from a deep involved mystery to a hackneyed anti-climax when it's all wrapped up in *The Time of the Doctor*.  We never even find out what the deal with Madame Kovarian is.  It's like everyone got sidetracked, realized they were of course, and pretended some stuff never happened or wasn't relevant. 

Since Moffat's taken over, they've had a bad habit of going back and ""revealing"" things the audience ""missed,"" only the audience never really missed them because they were never shown the first time around and the writers were just doing a retcon rewrite.  This is actually clever in some cases where there is a foreshadowing for those paying attention, like The Doctor using the Tesalecta to cheat death, but in those cases clues are given and the ""reveal"" is built up to in a way that makes sense.

Then there's the whole business of how The Doctor can never, ever go to Trenzalore until it's his time to die...until he does so.  He's not supposed to visit his own grave, but he not only goes in, he enters the swirling vortex of time energy that is his ""corpse"" so that he can rescue Clara.  Where were the consequences for this breach of temporal laws?

It's almost like everything is an opportunity to ""reveal"" that everything we know is wrong.  Like the Weeping Angels deciding to resort to mundane murder in their second showing despite what we were told about how they move people in time in order to feed.  What about how the xenophobic Daleks suddenly start infecting ""inferior"" species with nanites to convert them to pseudo-Daleks?  That makes sense with Cybermen, who have always absorbed at least humans, but the Daleks strive for purity.  They would never assimilate a lesser race the way they did in episodes like *Daleks in Manhattan* or *Aylum of the Daleks.*  Hell, they've destroy fellow Daleks when deemed unworthy, like they did at the end of *Victory of the Daleks*.

All that aside, as a Classic Who fan, who watched the show in my Jr. High and High School years, I'm glad to see Peter Capaldi in the role.  Hopefully it signals an end to the thing I hate most about the writing on Nu Who: it's like *Twilight* with aliens.  After a few hundred years it makes sense for the guy to finally decide he likes girls, but he keeps going through them, doesn't he?  First Rose, then River, and in the new season he tells Clara that he ""was never her boyfriend"" and when she responds that she never thought he was he says something to the effect of she wasn't the one making that mistake.  For a guy that never so much as flirted until his Ninth Incarnation (or is it 10th now, how's the numbering work after the ""War Doctor"" retcon?), he's making up for lost time.

Don't even get me started on the Strax/Jenny/Madame Vastra thing.  That's some of the worst shoe-horning I've ever seen.

true,eastlondonmandem,english,INGERLAND,"&gt;One wimax transmitter in london and one in brighton would easily cover the south east of england with wimax broadband.

Yeah I don't think you quite understand how these technologies work.

It's not just a one way transmitter, it's also a receiver. In order to service millions of people you need a certain amount of dedicated equipment per subscriber. So you can't just throw some kit on the top of Crystal Palace and job done.

In order to service the whole of London properly you would need a network on par with the GSM network, so thousands and thousands of base stations.

There are also serious frequency concerns.

The above statements are mutually inconsistent.

The confusion around the monarchy is on the amount of influence she has on day-to-day politics- we know that she regularly meets with the PM but the content of their meeting will always remain a secret.  We know that Prince Charles regularly corresponds with and talks to ministers, but again, we do not know what they say.  

People say that the queen would never abuse her power because that would lead to a civil war- I question how we would ever learn about such an abuse of power, since we now learn that even a Radio 1 DJ was able to cover up the most heinous of crimes to protect himself- our society is good at keeping secrets.

Just to play devil's advocate here: what happens if Yes wins and Westminster says ""well fuck you lot then"" and decides to withdraw administrative and public services faster than Salmond's vision predicts? What happens if the Scottish NHS trusts, police forces, fire services, etc, are told their funding does not continue past the end of the current financial year (next March)? The job centres close, the waste removal services stop and the roads stop being maintained? What happens if Credit Suisse are right and there's a deposit flight from Scots banks?

I hope, for Scotland's sake, there's a plan that accounts for the possibility that Westminster is every bit as nasty and disregarding of Scottish people's welfare as the Yes campaign believes and one that also accounts for the possibility that the panicky world of high finance panics. And by that I mean a plan beyond ""come on, that's just Westminster posturing, they'd never/can't do that"" because we're talking about an unprecedented situation.

&gt; Granted there are issues now over whether Scotland can use the Pound, but can Westminster really stop Scotland from using it?

They can't stop Scottish businesses from accepting the Pound, they can't stop Scottish banks from accepting the Pound from savers and investors and they can't stop the man in the street from carrying the cash in his pocket. 

They **can** stop Scottish banks from having access to new money 'printed' by the Bank of England, which would cripple those banks' capacity to issue new loans, and they can prevent UK banks from loaning money to any businesses or bank accounts registered north of the border.

Exactly. Holyrood controls devolved policies such as: education, the NHS, housing, social services, law and order, sport and the arts, tourism, agriculture, forestry, and the environment. Most of us would agree that it handles these affairs much better than Westminster, and we would like to see it take control of other policies such as: full tax raising and spending powers, employment, immigration, benefits, defence, trade &amp; industry, renewable energy, oil &amp; gas, data protection and the Constitution.",0,1410440171,null,0,false,0,ckf9xe1,t3_2g0oln,t1_ckf9xe1,t1_ckew7p0,null,1427074454,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Here's my two cents on bringing back characters who die: You need to tread *so very* carefully and write it *exceptionally* well because once you bring back someone from the dead - more than once - 'you don't kill them, you kill death'. Even when the Doctor 'dies' he is *completely* different, he's transformed. He's kind of the exception but for people who can't regenerate death is now not a final thing and it loses its punch, so by the time Rory and Amy *really* left the show it was like... yeah I don't... they're probably could come back if Moffat wanted. The flood gates open, anyone can come back to life and quite frankly anything to do with death doesn't seem as dangerous anymore because you know they're probably going to come back to life. There is no consequence because Sherlock and Moriarty faked it, or Jenny came back because Vastra had her [insert medicine plot device] (then what was the point in her 'dying' for two minutes in the first place!?) or River who's rebooted to live her life in a cyber world or Oswald who's got clones throughout history or Rory who's just... Rory. There's no consequence of death and, quite frankly you can feel cheated for having your emotions be played with for no actually reason.

If we make up some hypothetical numbers:
50% of the population vote. 
70% say yes to independence.
This means that ONLY 35% of the country really want independence enough to vote for it meaning the other 65% either don't want it or don't care either way. 

Now I know that many will say its the fault of the ""didn't voters"" if they don't like independence if it comes to that but I think this is way too big a decision to not include the whole country, or at least a majority of them. 

This is not like a general election, when it comes to those you are given a choice between 3-4 parties who don't really differ from each other all that much in practice (even if they do in ideology) where as independence is offering two very different options. It is too important a decision to not have a true majority on. 

That said I see where you're coming from with it will never happen but if the Yes (or No) parties cannot convince enough of the population to vote either way then are they really acting in the best interests of the entire population?

When I last checked (over a year ago), there was still no clear ruling on this, with the websites like MoneyDashboard all saying ""we still think your bank has a legal obligation to protect you"" and some banks saying otherwise.

The advantage of First Direct IBP (and it's derivatives; it is a white-labelled version of somebody else's software. Egg have a similar piece of software. The original creator's name escapes me) is that it doesn't store your logon details.

&gt;How are my account details kept secure and secret?
&gt;Your bank account IDs and passwords are private to you and first direct strongly believe they should stay that way. Your details will be encrypted and securely stored in the digital safe, which is created personally for you and stored on your PC. first direct have no way of viewing this information and it is used only from your PC to log on to your accounts in the same way that you would access them.

For this reason it is less convenient (can only be accessed from computers that you have setup with it), but more secure than Moneydashboard, onTrees etc.

Also, you **can** sign up for IBP without being a FD customer.

Additionally, make all Metropolitan counties have proper assemblies with representatives from each of their Metropolitan boroughs. These Metropolitan Assemblies would have the same power and structure as the London Assembly. There would be seven of them including London: Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear, West Midlands, West Yorkshire. The assemblies would replace the county councils, obviously.

Then add Regional Assemblies along the borders of the eight Regions (NW, NE, Yorkshire, E Mids, W. Mids, East, SE, SW). The regions would *exclude* the Metropolitan county areas, and the regional assemblies would have the same structure and power as the Metropolitan Assemblies, except their subdivisions would be County not Borough. Non-metro counties would then have the same powers as Metro boroughs.

You could also do some renaming. Metropolitan County -&gt; Urban Area. Metropolitan Borough -&gt; Borough. Non-metropolitan County -&gt; County. Region can stay as Region. Might be worth redrawing the Non-metro County borders so they match up with the Ceremonial County borders as well.

Not sure about the living in UK for 3 years, if you've actually been working/living abroad - might have screwed yourself there and have to wait.

The other kind of option is to study through the OU, and then transfer to a full-time course for your second/third years. Only certain universities may accept you, although I know someone intending to do it, and they're looking at heading to Bristol, so they're not bad universities.

While this review does contain some perfectly valid criticisms of Owen Jones' new book it's probably worth pointing out that the review is written by the Institute for Economic Affairs and if anyone has reason to do a hatchet job on Jones then it's the IEA. 

The IEA is one of Britain's foremost neoliberal thinktanks, their entire reason for being is to push a specific ideology that's been dominant in UK politics since Thatcher came to power in '79, one that's broadly subscribed to by all of the three major parties and UKIP. This is the ideology of Thatcher, Major, Blair, Brown, Cameron and Clegg. 

If you're unsure of what neoliberalism is, there's plenty of material out there for you to look at, but it can be vaugely (and perhaps slightly unfairly) summed up thus: 

* Markets can and will solve everything. Let the market decide.
* State spending on welfare is bad.
* The virtue of an institution is measured purely in profit it makes or (if it's a state institution) the profit it allows businesses to make.
* Society is an illusion. The truth is that we are all individual rational economic actors and if we are all allowed to act in a way that maximises our self-interest above all else then an ordered equilibrium will emerge from the chaos. 
* Meritocracy is real. We should allow the wealthy to be as wealthy as they can be and the poor deserve their poverty.

So *of course* they hate socialists and social democrats like Owen Jones. The IEA are disciples of Friedman, Hayak and Rand. The methods and goals of socially minded and egalitarian individuals or groups are repugnant to them.

Even the title of this submission to reddit ""In which Owen Jones encounters[...] a grown-up"" is a fine example of what's become known in philosophical circles as Capitalist Realism. Capitalist Realism is the central propaganda conceit of the neoliberal age, where any alternative to neoliberalism's specific interpretation of capitialism is dismissed as childish/unworkable/impossible/unrealistic and that the only 'realistic' option is to accept the existing economic order forever.

- We have a brand new shiny training facility

- A good youth setup (Academy produces good talent but has yet to produce the ""Holy Shit that kid is good"" talent)

- We consistently finish in the top half of the table

- We have the groundwork laid to open markets in Asia and N.America

- We are located in London, one of the most desirable cities on the planet

- We will have a new stadium built **in London**, meaning a new buyer won't have to deal with the politics of getting a stadium built in a city where real estate prices rank amongst the highest in the world. 

- We have almost no debt

To a billionaire we check virtually every box you would want in a club **AND** you wouldn't have to come in and focus on rebuilding the club or doing any of the difficult bullshit that are needed to build a successful club....We are effectively a ""plug and play"" club once the stadium is finished all the new owner needs to do is simply improve the squad on the pitch and continue the growth in other markets.

These billionaires get to where they are and more importantly **STAY** where they are financially because they can recognize a good investment.....Spurs would be a good investment now, but would be an even better investment once construction is final on the stadium just like buying a house AFTER construction is finished is better than dealing with the delays and bullshit (and likely increased cost) if you buy before or during construction.",0,1410442448,null,0,false,0,ckfaquf,t3_2g3j8x,t1_ckfaquf,t1_ckf9lck,null,1427074072,12,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,12

There are 3 times as many people living in London and the South East as there are in Scotland, which means they have better representation in Westminster and their issues are prioritised over ours. This is understandable, and it would be acceptable if we faced similar political issues, but we don't. Scotland suffers under policies which are not suited to us, as we're consistently outnumbered and powerless to make a difference.

On top of this, Westminster uses first-past-the-post voting which results in a two party system (Conservative and Labour) which many in Scotland are unhappy with. Holyrood uses a more proportional system, giving fairer representation to minority parties such as the Lib Dems, the Greens, and (ironically) the Conservatives. If it was designed like Westminster, only a vote for the SNP or Labour would matter. Thankfully, Holyrood is more democratic and represents the diverse wishes of Scottish people better. It also has no unelected House of Lords, no affiliation with the Church of England, uses a more modern democratic process, and is more transparent. This makes it a fairer and less corrupt government.

Although it's relativity young, Holyrood has had a massive positive impact on Scotland. It controls devolved policies such as: education, the NHS, housing, social services, law and order, sport and the arts, tourism, agriculture, forestry, and the environment. Most of us would agree that it handles these affairs much better than Westminster, and we would like to see it take control of other policies such as: employment, immigration, benefits, defence, trade &amp; industry, full tax raising and spending powers, renewable energy, oil &amp; gas, data protection and the Constitution.

There are plenty of us doing okay in Scotland and the UK, but many in our society are being let down by our government and it's not going to change any time soon.

Ok, tell that to the rating agencies. I'm sure that'll make perfect sense to them. 

&gt;This is why there will be a currency union. 

How does that follow. As has been stated numerous times by Mr. Carney the union the SNP wants is not viable. 

&gt;The UK will take a huge hit if not as well don't forget if not agreement on this.

But not the utterly economy destroying one the Scotish state woudl take. Scotland has no leverage here what so ever, the 'not taking the debt' argument is completely non-viable as i've pointed out numerous times.

The only result of these negocations are going to be a slew of fiscal restrictions in order to insulate the BoE from acting as the lender of last resort to the Scotish state being a likely risk. 

If you counter argument is 'nuhuh' my counter argument is look at the ECB and Greece. *Thats* how a currency union works.  

&gt;If (and again, this won't happen, but let's say for arguments sake) after long negotiations the UK chooses not to share then Scotland will have a blank slate - ie much better off than with the debt and a clean central bank and new currency with the 15th largest economy in the world. It would be much better actually.

No, that is not an option. Scotland would have a junk credit rating and it would be impossible to do anything but completely slash every service and massively raise taxes.

Wat? If they're operating front end banks in your country, that's in the government's regulatory jurisdiction. Operating any sort of business in a country puts that business under local jurisdiction. This is why, for example, Goldman Sachs fell off a cliff in 2008 - they were forced into bankruptcy in the USA by the US regulator and local regulation in the UK meant they had to cease trading in London immediately, which the US regulators didn't realise, which then basically destroyed them. 

&gt;RBS could go back to its old ways of simply fucking inventing and selling junk debt packages and the Scotish government could do fuck all about it. 

If you're referring to CDOs which were the source of most of the Credit Crunch grief, then no, they couldn't. Unless Edinburgh opened a new stock exchange to trade them and then the Scottish Government didn't regulate that exchange due to ???

Otherwise Scottish investors would still buy those CDOs on other exchanges (London) and so those would still be regulated by the still completely useless FCA.

Yes it's an issue, but it's not going to be the end of the world if these companies move.

There are many people who generate business besides the Monarchy, why we keep falling back on this old trope every time we question the principle of maintaining such a quaintly irrelevant institution beats me.

&gt;You have a odd view of Scotland it seems.. either are they are valued asset to the UK or say they are not, but not both.

What?

&gt;Scotland has plenty of leverage.

It doesn't, Scotland is utterly dependent on trade with England. The rest of the U.K is not, and in submitting to be a junior member in a hypothetical currency union, it has little to no leverage. 

&gt; Looking at ECB and Greece as your only example of a currency union is not great either.

No its the most extreme example, look at the entire of the Euro's implementation. 

&gt;Of course I agree the EU banking was set up badly, people much smarter than us know this too and will take that into consideration.

No the fundamental problem with the Euro and all Currency unions is that the inability to set monteary polciy different for different nations with different fiscal programs and different trading profiles means that its horribly inflexible and works poorly for at least some of its members at any given moment. 

This is why the euro zone is now making big moves towards fiscal union.

&gt;Scotland would have not have junk if they have 0 debt and such a large economy and GDP. Please stop comparing to 3rd world countries, it's not anything close to a good argument.

Ok your a credit ratings agency that monitors debt aquisitions by nations. The new Scottish nation is refusing to take on of the debt accumulated which was spent in Scotland.

How do you react?

He's not done here. There's plenty of games where he is still first choice for that position. I think that there's becoming more and more games where he is not.

We may get away with it against some teams like Southampton (very narrowly), but against the big boys we will be punished.

true,stubble,null,London Arab,"&gt;The monarchy is irrelevant in the 21st century, though I can absolutely see why it's still popular.

As far as I can see the chief reason for its continued popularity is more due to the efforts of the tabloids (via the Palace PR machine) to keep showing us pictures of grinning couples who've been busy shagging. 

The level of exposure the monarchy now gets is way less than it used to be. I remember as a kid (I'm extremely old) that most news broadcasts, certainly at the BBC, consisted of little more than a Royal diary; Queen opens supermarket, queen launches ship, QE2 sets sail, Royals visit dark people somewhere, Ann wins show jumping event, etc etc.

This has slowly disappeared from our main news bulletins as their actual relevance has also declined since the mid 60s.

A quick search for Prince Andrew just now finds our dear friends at the Daily Fail still talking about his relationship with Sarah Ferguson. If, as people here seem to think, these guys are actually pulling business in then that would surely grab some headlines or at least a mention in the FT...

true,CrashingAnalyst,eng-gloucestershire,Cheltenham,"Ooh ooh I can kind of answer this.

I've been looking into this and there's a couple of isuses.

1. Minimum speeds. The EU and the government has made available funding for internet infrastructure upgrades. However they have *strict* criteria on the minimum speeds you must be able to offer - 24Mbps I believe. So this means that even someone on 0.5Mbps who would benefit from wifi or 4g mast, the money is not available because 4g isn't recognised as superfast enough / not guaranteed. Essentially the money is only available for 'gold standard' infrastructure, even if for the same money you could boost 10x the people up to 10Mbps, the money is only available to boost people up to **at least** 24Mbps.

2. There are concerns that wimax can interfere with TV signals. Basically the radio frequencies we use are heavily policed and there just isn't enough 'available' frequency to spare for a large rollout of WiMax.

3. Infrastructure. The effective system would be for these technologies to piggyback onto the fibre network you would think. In reality, Openreach and Virgin DO NOT let anyone share their fibre network unless they are obligated to by law. If it's a monopoly you want to keep it afterall. The government is looking into this, but money talks, BT Openreach are currently partners in the rollout of BDUK so do you really expect the government to turn round and tell them they have to open their network to everyone? At the minute it's not 'by law' open but there are some deals that are done (e.g. Sky I believe) in exchange for £££.

4. Competition &amp; commercial interest. The money is only available where there is no commercial prospect of improving an area. If you're in London, there is a commercial prospect of improving the area, so the government will ont build the masts themselves as that would be 'disrupting the free market'. Because the government won't do it, nobody else will either because the status quo of a) take profitable jobs when they're available and b) get EU funding for other jobs works out really nicely for businesses. It's really not in their interest to do the job any cheaper or quicker, it would just mean they would get less money, and there is a clear mandate that the government will not step in to improve efficiency.

This touches on the issues:
http://www.fastershire.com/assets/file/Fastershire%20Broadband%20Strategy%202014-18.pdf

&gt;Strategically, the European Commission want to see universal access to &gt;30Mbps
NGA
by 2020. Put simply, the Commission
through its
state aid guidelines
determine that NGA
can only be delivered by Fibre Optic and must provide a step
change to what is already available to the premise.
S
tate Aid constraints have
to
date inhibited
sub
sidising
alternative solutions such as wireless and mobile. While
the EC guidelines on the investment in NGA claims to be technology agnostic, the
only
r
eal
technology it provides the
ability
to subsidise is fibre.

*

&gt; Finally in terms of wireless solutions,
as radio frequencies do not respect eligibility
boundaries, subsidised wireless networks can spill over into areas which have received NGA
from either commercial providers or through previously subsidised intervention. This risks
both double funding and
market distortion and
measures will be required to mitigate this
risk
.

*

&gt;However, the business case to invest in deeply rural areas with wireless is barely profitable in the first place. Added
to that, the requirement to reinvest profits into fibre upgrades which were not vi
able to start with and the
clarifications appear not to have altered the environment.
In terms of mobile, all the same issues are inherent as wireless. Additionally, the 4G market is not yet considered to
be mature, therefore public bodies are prevented f
rom proving that
a
market failure exists despite being able to
estimate in which areas the market will ultimately fail to deliver. ",0,1410445298,null,0,false,0,ckfbxm3,t3_2g3f1z,t1_ckfbxm3,t3_2g3f1z,null,1427073518,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I'd argue that the negotiations are bound to go well, because if they don't the UK is stuck with £4 billion worth of debt per year, which they will not accept given that they put the bedroom tax in place to save a tenth of that.

But let's say the negotiations don't go well, the most likely scenario is that using the pound without a formal currency union would be a temporary scenario - there are several Scottish parties for independence that are not the SNP, most notably the Scottish Greens, who want Scotland to make its own currency. Obviously this takes time, so would need a temporary scenario in which people could still trade without worry for a while. If the UK government decides to be vindictive and go the route that you just suggested, they are somewhat shooting themselves in the foot.

The truth is, while I love Eccleston's acting, the first season just isn't very good. The only episodes from it that I think are really worth watching are ""Dalek"" and ""The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances"". Everything else is just fun if you already like the show and need something to fill time with.

I would highly recommend skipping forward to, at the least, the second season. Many of its episodes are still campy and silly, but Tennant's run is overall much better, and from season three onward, it's almost non-stop hits (not counting the Master episodes, of course - blech).

If you really just want some proof that there's something good to look forward to, I highly recommend that you just watch ""Blink"". It requires no prior knowledge of the series and is functionally a stand-alone horror story, and it's absolutely brilliant. It's also the episode that proved to me that *Doctor Who* is worth watching.

Other stand-outs include ""Silence In The Library"", ""Midnight"", ""Human Nature"", and ""The Waters of Mars"", though all of those require a bit more knowledge of the series to fully enjoy. Except ""Midnight"". That's another stand-alone horror thing.

I'm doing my OU degree full time whilst also working full time, and you'd better believe it's not easy. First year is a bit easier because it's getting everyone up to the same speed, but you cannot do second and third year study half heartedly.

Don't rule a transfer out - if they can find any common link, they will give it to you. My first degree was a vocational degree in Theatre Production, my OU degree is a BA (Hons) in History. I got enough credits allocated to skip one first year module, and I could have got more if I'd opened up my degree title more. With the OU you can be very specific about your degree title down to History, English etc, or you can open it wide to do an Open degree where you can pick and choose any combination of modules you like.

Not just in 2011, as all of the Scottish elections have shown similar levels of dis-proportionality. But I think one of the key points of implementing a PR system should be that you need a majority of the vote to get a majority of seats, as part of a % of vote = % of seats idea in general. Obviously no system is perfect and even the best practical system might lead to a majority of seats with slightly under 50% of the vote, but I think 6% on the list and 4.4% on the constituency level is too low.

The current system as implemented doesn't give adequate proportionality because the lists are too small, and so I think Scotland should abolish the regional lists and move to a national list system such as New Zealand. Ultimately, there aren't enough regional seats to adequately counteract a strong constituency performance in a particular region. For example, in Lothian where the SNP dominated and won 8 of the 9 constituency seats, there were only 7 list seats which simply isn't enough to ensure a proportional result, even though the SNP didn't win a single list seat. Not anti-SNP here, but it's obviously impossible to find a similar example for any other party in 2011!

I'd personally argue that PR is *more* democratic. With a majority government elected via FPTP they can push through pretty much whatever they like, however with a proportional system resulting (usually) in more hung parliaments the major party is limited and must compromise to get an overall consensus more in line with what the majority of the electorate want.

Yes FPTP is less forgiving in one sense, but it results in the two main parties essentially monopolising power. If you don't like the Conservatives, you have to vote for Labour - what about the millions of people who don't want either and whos voices are going unheard?

From /u/the_oncoming_storm

&gt; Multinationals are good at evading taxes by dubious practices. For example, Starbucks UK ""buy"" beans from Starbucks Switzerland at very expensive prices because tax in Switzerland is lower.
&gt; Starbucks UK also borrows vast sums of money from Starbucks Low-Tax-Country at very high interests rates, and ""pays the debt back"" from its profits rather than pay tax on those profits in the UK.
&gt; It's the same with Amazon and Luxembourg.
&gt; Where a Scotland run by the SNP would have a competitive advantage in such a scenario is that they intend to cut Corporation Tax, thus encouraging foreign investment from multinationals, and having them cook the books to pay tax on their profits in Scotland.
&gt; It's commonly know as the Irish model. Google, Facebook, IBM and many other companies have their European HQs in Dublin for precisely this reason.

**Where am I compared to where I thought I’d be?** 

Very far away.

I’d always wanted to be a soldier, I found something inherently noble about fighting for ones nation. I was never a nationalist even if I was proud of what my nation had accomplished.

I joined when I was 18 after losing close to 35 kilos to get in and I flew through basic and phase 2 very damn quickly. Three weeks before I was due to be sent to regiment something happened and my OC threw me under a bus to protect himself. I was medically discharged due to a injury in said incident that has plagued me ever since.

I came out of the forces and fell into a quiet job in civvy street. My mind fucking annihilated by being betrayed by someone and something I held in such high regard. I realised the core values meant fucking nothing to anyone except myself, I longed to serve… and that had failed nicely. 

I’ve spent the next six-seven years in utter turmoil at the concept of failure. My girlfriend sat me down and explained that it wasn’t healthy for a 25/26 year old man to be so hateful towards the world. I understood, calmed my ass down, forgot what happened (ha) and strengthened myself with what I know.

I’m training for something else, happy in my relationship, couldn’t care about those that have no time for me… and I know where I want to be, for the first time in my life I feel a direction that I can go in and not feel the oppression of past failure on my shoulders.

""Scottish voters are more left-leaning than the British population as a whole (particularly the English).

The welfare state is more generous, too: things that English voters must pay for, such as university tuition and medical prescriptions, are still free in Scotland. Three years of centre-right administration in Westminster have only accentuated the differences. The English public sector has endured deep cuts; the Scottish one, by contrast, is relatively unscathed. So Scots might be forgiven for thinking that more autonomy means more goodies. The SNP has certainly implied that much in the independence campaign so far. All this talk of the social-democratic good life points to a third factor: the debate about Scotland's place in the world. The SNP likes to compare an independent Scotland to successful countries like Denmark, Norway and Sweden; proof, it claims, that small, northern European states can thrive in a globalised world.

Of course we could probably raise a lot more with an effective taxation system but who needs it when we're all getting an extra half of Guinness per year thanks to all the holiday efforts of a bunch of toffs.

&gt;The Crown has a legal tax-exempt status because certain acts of parliament do not apply to it. Crown bodies such as The Duchy of Lancaster are not subject to legislation concerning income tax, capital gains tax or inheritance tax. Furthermore, the Sovereign has no legal liability to pay such taxes. The Duchy of Cornwall has a Crown exemption and the Prince of Wales is not legally liable to pay income tax on Duchy revenues.

This has to amount to a bit more than £2 per head if realised. And yes I know the Queen and Charles now make some *voluntary* tax payments, if only we knew how much though...

It's hard not to see them as the overall beneficiaries of their position rather than the powerhouse revenue generators you seem to prefer to cast them as.

Business won't necessarily pass on these higher costs to an independent Scotland. Scotland and the UK share an island, the English language, and for the time being the same currency.

The app (Android) is basic, but has interesting features like ""impulse saving"" whereby you can save up to £20 from a selected current account to a selected savings account without logging in. The idea being that you ""impulse save"" what you might have spent on a coffee that morning.

It also has a balance viewing option on the app without a password needed.

Both are optional and I haven't bothered enabling either as I see no value when set against the security issues.

Nationwide also have counter service, which is useful for the few times a year I actually need to deal with them.

The Scottish white paper outlines your plans to join the EU by smooth painless transition. There are many reasons this won't happen, but the strongest is that every EU member has to ratify a new Scotland Joining. Spain and Belgium would [veto this](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scottish-independence/11054187/Spain-and-Belgium-would-veto-an-independent-Scotlands-EU-membership.html).

&gt; NATO, Oh yeah... the terrorists... Remind me when were they planning on invading scotland?

Do you even? Again, the plan outlining the vision for Scotland expicitly states that the plan is to remain within NATO - despite this being entirely at NATO's discretion, and Scotland having very little to bring to the table with it's proposed 15,000 soldiers, 12 aircraft and no nuclear deterrent. Incidentally, the hypocrisy of wanting to rid Scotland of Trident only to live under a far bigger Nuclear Umbrella is not addressed.

No. The Banks are losing capital as we speak. Scotlands financial system is weaker today than it was last week. The Pound has dropped. What does that tell you?

 
&gt; Oil ? Are you fucking kidding me? That is one thing that you can't even argue against. WM Has been pissing it down the drain for years. Experts have came out and said there is trillions worth of oil left. I want to know your sources for all those points.

So when it costs everyone 50p, think of the loss of money, all those poor people etc...but when we get more back, it amounts to nothing. Got it.

&gt;thanks to all the holiday efforts of a bunch of toffs.

This says more about you than the subject at hand.

&gt;The Crown has a legal tax-exempt status because certain acts of parliament do not apply to it.
&gt;Furthermore, the Sovereign has no legal liability to pay such taxes.

The Crown Estate is the property equivalent of the Crown jewels - part of the national heritage and held by Her Maj as sovereign, but not available for her private use. Hence, you can't tax someone for stuff they technically don't really own.

&gt;This has to amount to a bit more than £2 per head if realised. And yes I know the Queen and Charles now make some voluntary tax payments, if only we knew how much though...

Oh, so *now* it's different than a pint of Guinness.

&gt;It's hard not to see them as the overall beneficiaries of their position rather than the powerhouse revenue generators you seem to prefer to cast them as.

I see them as both. And ultimately, they *are* revenue generators - that doesn't change just because your knowledge of their work or visits to other countries extends to the term 'holidays'.

If she has power, then she has an unelected birth-right to power, which is obviously wrong, because people shouldn't be given power or responsibility for a country purely from the accident of birth.

If she has no power, then she is superfluous and completely unnecessary, in which case why do we have an entire family of them? Why do we have to *pretend* that they have some power to accept or reject laws?

&gt;but the overwhelming public (and commonwealth) reaction to the royals is exactly why there's no real need for a referendum or similar - democracy in action - , and democracy isn't something you only go along with when it agrees with you, so isn't it a bit silly to play that card?

Not sure what you're getting at, but that's the exact opposite of democracy. You're just saying that as long as a dictator is benevolent, then there's no need for an election! What about when she dies and the next one is not so benevolent? Is that when you start caring about democracy?

I'm arguing that it should *always* be democratic, whether they are good or bad leaders, they should be democratically elected. No exceptions. No, ""oh this one is nice, let's just let her stay Queen"". If she's so popular, she can go through an election and become President, whatever, so long as she is elected.

Let me just make clear that I am not anti-this-Queen. I think she appears to be perfectly nice and decent. And if she ran for President, I'd probably vote for her.

I think recently though that The Times Podcast (The Game) has even stepped above Guardian Football Weekly (possibly).

When they focus on a club, you get a lot of great insight and information.

I would say that Guardian Football Weekly has improved massively since the end of last season. Towards the end of last year there was too many James Horncastle episodes, Glendining was doing my head in, and a couple of other bores most weeks. It's been excellent so far this season though.

Just want to throw Football Ramble in there as well - a very enjoyable podcast when it's Luke, Marcus and Pete.

Early targets would have been the various ports, supply bases, nuclear reactors, and large runways that support aircraft and fleet activities, from Winfrith to Calder Hall, from Heathrow to Macrihanish.

true,davedubya,flair5,,"Generally, it's going to be a more senior player. Usually that means the older, more experienced players (25 and over, has at least a season under his belt). 

However, it's not unheard of to name a new signing as captain and build the team around them.

**So you have:**

*Lloris, Vorm, Friedel, Kaboul, Vertonghen, Fazio, Capoue, Paulinho, Dembele, Lennon, Chadli, Roberto Soldado, Adebayor.*

Vorm and Friedel aren't realistically going to be captain. Fazio is too new. Adebayor doesn't seem like Captaincy material and Soldado currently lacks the confidence to score goals let alone having the stature to lead the team on the field.
 
**Which leaves:**

*Lloris, Kaboul, Vertonghen, Capoue, Paulinho, Dembele, Lennon, Chadli*

Are Capoue, Paulinho, Dembele Lennon or Chadli going to be playing regularly enough? They've already been left out of squads. Lennon is one of the current two vice-captains, but I'm just not sure he's now playing such a large role in the side. It needs to be a player who has cemented his role.

**Which whittles it down to:**

*Lloris, Kaboul, Vertonghen*

Each has captaincy experience (Vertonghen at Ajax and for Belgium, Kaboul for France as a youth and as current de-facto club captain and Lloris for France). It could be argued that Kaboul may not be the ultimate first choice centre half this season, whereas it is assumed that Vertonghen quite likely will be. Lloris has no particular competition for his spot at the moment. However, compared to the other two, perhaps doesn't always feels like a natural leader on the pitch.

Also, we'd be losing valuable cover for the first team, like Vlad or Capoue, who I think can only go up from last season.

A parent company is the ultimate destination for the money, and it is at this point that there is the big prize for HMRC.

Subsidiaries would of course pay corporation tax in the local place of activity (as you rightly say) if they have a profit there. However as they have a parent company they will be due payments to that parent that reduce the profits down.

Let's look at Starbucks. They will have something like Starbucks UK Ltd, which will have hundreds of millions of revenue (probably even more) in the UK. However there is virtually no corporation tax as their overseas branches always invoice them for things that reduce the UK profit right down.

Starbucks can jump through numerous countries of course, but at some point the money ends up at a final destination. 

The country that is the final destination (the HQ) is the one that gets all that lovely tax.

So, it matters where your HQ is and it is why Ireland and Switzerland entice companies away from the UK.

It's moving its registration which it would have to do under EU law *anyway*, Mark Carney told us this last year in his meeting with the Treasury Select Committee. The registration has to be in the same nation as the 'mind' of the institution and its the Bank of England that decides where the mind is (Since it provides regulatory and lender of last resort facilities)

It's only the retail division of RBS that is in Edinburgh, 90% of their employees are in the rest of the UK and the bank's top decision makers are in London next to the disastrous investment wings that required the bailouts.

Lloyds, TSB and Clydesdale are in the same position. They are all managed from London it's just divisions they've bought from old banks that retained the registrations in Scotland. It's a quirk of history. For all risk related matters they are very much Bank of England backed London banks.

2.) John Lewis

Their claim is that English operations subsidise more expensive operations in Scotland and that would stop under independence. Why aren't they doing this already? Surely it doesn't make much business sense even in the UK to just absorb higher costs when every other company would spin off a Scottish loss making subsidiary?

Tesco however have said that prices *wouldn't* rise (In response to a BT leaflet that claimed because Ireland pays more we would)

3.) Currency Union. The money that was removed from 'Scottish facing' companies last week (After the 51% YES poll) is now being put back in on the announcement that they'll re-register in England. These companies are *still* Scottish facing (and have said would continue operating in Scotland) so that suggests to me that what the market is really worried about is sterling stability and BoE protection for the banks, not the collapse of the Scottish end post independence.

Guess what safeguards those two things *and* makes sure that the Bank of England retains significant influence over the Scottish facing elements of these banks? Currency union. When you throw in that the rUK is naturally going to experience some downturn due to losing 10% GDP overnight, losing future asset securities in the oil, losing nuclear weapon stability... you arrive at a position where least disruption possible is in the best interests of everyone involved.

The common point unionists make is that rUK *""won't be lender of last resort to Scottish banks""*. Well as we've seen today they won't be Scottish banks. So you end up with a situation where banks are domiciled in rUK for the BoE protection but have divisions and operations in Scotland, where they'd pay corporation tax. Is that a situation rUK would like? It's kind of what's going on with US/Microsoft/Ireland where all the bad bits are in the US and all the money is in Ireland for the low corporate tax rate.

So a currency union means;
 
* Sharing lender of last resort responsibilities with Scotland

* Retaining balance of payments at the Bank of England

* Retaining North Sea oil futures assets

* Retaining tight regulation over some of the most toxic banks in the world

* Retaining a good deal of influence over Scotland's tax &amp; spend policies

* Not disrupting the £45bn in exports rUK sends to Scotland every year

* Sterling remaining stable

* Money not fleeing to America or Europe or wherever whilst all this mess blows over.

* Then throw in a few extra cards like maybe trident extending its stay in Scotland or whatever the hell else he can think of (Maybe not dropping corporate tax rate to company uprooting levels)

Will rUK pass all that up because they don't want to sit at a table in the Bank of England and discuss some sort of shared economic policy with a nation much more similar than any two in Europe? A nation they already share economic policy with, a nation that won't *really* change that policy too much? *Maybe*. ...but Salmond is basically betting the house on even Westminster being a bit more sensible than that. It's not *really* much of a gamble though because even if he loses we'll just keep using sterling unofficially which puts all the financial sector risk on rUK, stabilise the country, unpeg the currency and join the Euro.",0,1410450885,null,0,1410479810,1,ckfenpz,t3_2g3cxv,t1_ckfenpz,t1_ckfblpx,null,1427071886,19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,19

Outside of drawing dicks I joined the Army when I was 17.  I did two tours in Iraq that fucked me up pretty bad mentally.  I lost a couple of friends and I just couldn't get over it.  I spent 7 years after getting out almost never leaving my house.  I drank a lot and cut off all communication with my friends.  I was alone for a lot of it.  This past year things have been getting better and better.  I've made new friends.  I have a new car, a dog, and I'm moving to a new town.  I go to the VA for therapy and it's helping.  Things are looking so much better now.


I don't know exactly what you're going through, but I know dicks are funny, and life can get better.

true,Unmouldeddoor3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxford,"Wow okay, calm down. If open argument about politics involves being called an insane cunt then it sure sounds like a healthy way of going about governance to me. I apologise for being somewhat dismissive of your beliefs; allow me to explain my position with regards to ""Anarcho-Capitalism"" and related political theories.

I disagree with the premise that open governance would be the fairest form of government. I agree that yes, in theory, it would be fantastic if we all could decide how we wanted to govern ourselves and everyone got exactly what they wanted from the state (such as it existed) and their fellow human beings.

However, this overlooks, well, reality. The biggest problem is that most people don't know what they want. I don't mean this in the condescending sense of ""oh, people are stupid"", I mean that the realities of economics, diplomacy, healthcare, law, defence and so on are far beyond the ken of those who haven't invested a significant amount of time researching and working in those areas - and if even among the most learned in their fields there can be substantial disagreement about pretty much everything, how is the average person on the street supposed to come to a proper decision about these things?

Open governance assumes a much greater level of involvement in the political process, far above and begin just ""a greater turnout in elections"", because now you have a situation in which, for the system to be ""fair"", people would have to know exactly what it is they're voting about. This is asking a lot of people. Most people aren't apathetic towards the political process because the current government is out of touch, but because for most people there are more immediately pressing issues in their lives (what shall I have for dinner / will I get promoted / does Steve like me?), and they only have a finite amount of time to devote to understanding the things that make the country run smoothly.

This is the purpose of representative democracy. You acknowledge that you don't know how to run a country, so instead you trust people whose views on ""how things should be"" tally roughly with yours to spend their time actually making the decisions and fighting the fights to make those things happen, so that you don't have to. Now, I have a lot of problems with how ""representative"" our current voting system is, and was shocked at the resistance to any change highlighted by the AV vote, but I still firmly believe a representative system is vital for providing a ""fairer"" of government to the most people at once.

Now you might retort that, surely, we could just let those who know about science decide about scientific things, those who know about the military decide about military things, and so on. The problem with this is that it assumes that every one do these professions would have a range of viewpoints, and be drawn from a diverse spectrum of society, when in fact this is not the case. In the example of the military, a much higher proportion of the officer corps are from private school or aristocratic backgrounds than the population as a whole, and so left to their own devices, the military might reflect those values as opposed to the interests of the country as a whole. This would be exacerbated in a system without state support for those lower down in society, who then wouldn't have the opportunity to have a voice in areas that do affect them. This is the ""fairness"" that a representative democracy provides that a ""direct"" one would not allow, for the reasons I've outlined above.


As a side note, while yes I do post on r/Christianity , and I do spend a lot of my time in the Church of England (because I am a professional singer in a cathedral choir) I am not, in fact, a theist, and I do not appreciate being told that I am ""imposing an insane system of beliefs"" on anyone. Those members of the Anglican clergy whom I know personally are all extremely liberal, and seem to spend most of their time telling people it'd be lovely if they could just get on with everyone and not let their faith get in the way of that. I, too, used to indiscriminately hate on anyone religious until I realised that actually a lot of them are very pleasant and caring people trying to work out how best to live their lives. There are a lot of problems with all organised religions, including the Church of England, but telling everyone involved that they're an insane cunt is possibly not the best way to make friends.

&gt; ""As to the question whether 'sterlingisation' were compatible with EU membership, the answer is that this would simply not be possible, since that would obviously imply a situation where the candidate country concerned would not have a monetary authority of its own, and thus no necessary instruments of the EMU.""

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;That is obviously great power.

No, it is not. A traffic warden can have your car crushed, but they're still a traffic warden - and the queen has to operate by a similar set of rules. It's only 'great power' if she could wield it at will - but she can't.

&gt;If she has no power, then she is superfluous and completely unnecessary,

Why does one lead to the other? That's a rather big leap.

&gt;Why do we have to pretend that they have some power to accept or reject laws?

Not sure where you got 'pretending' from; there's a difference between blocking law as part of one's mandate, and using it at a whim - she blocked Parliament from giving themselves sole authorisation for bombing strikes in Iraq; but that wasn't directly because she personally didn't like it.

&gt;Not sure what you're getting at, but that's the exact opposite of democracy. 

You think the majority view is being ignored?

&gt;You're just saying that as long as a dictator is benevolent, then there's no need for an election! 

No, that's not what I said - it appears to be more a case of you calling anyone that doesn't ask *your* permission a dictator instead of recognising the majority viewpoint. Which is kind of like a dictator :-)

&gt;What about when she dies and the next one is not so benevolent?

Define 'not so benevolent'. Give an example of what Charles or Prince William *could* do. It's not exactly the middle-ages, any more...

&gt; Is that when you start caring about democracy?

Well, we'll obviously all have to ask *you* if it's OK first, since you don't recognise majority opinion.

&gt;If she's so popular, she can go through an election and become President, whatever, so long as she is elected.

And we should fund this election why, exactly? Where is your democratic decision that one is needed? Do you have a huge following of anti-royal supporters who just haven't made themselves known until now?

&gt;I am just anti-monarchy because I don't think people should be born into high positions in government or society.

People *aren't* - you're using the grandfather-that-smoked-to-90 example. We don't have *lots* of Royal Families - it would kind of defeat the purpose if we did, no?

People are born into high positions in society - nothing we can do about that, really - but I'm not sure I've heard of anyone getting into Government in a hereditary fashion. Nobody considers the Queen as a valid example because she doesn't really govern or have any independent power.

They don't have any because they didn't bother their arse. 

All we hear is ""SNP has no plans"", the wrote an entire book. Then we hear ""these plans are crap!"". Well, if they are crap then where is the alternative? Or do we only pay Labour MPs to nitpick SNP policy instead of actually coming up with something themselves? The SNP are a party, the independence campaign is nationwide.

You were responding to someone talking about company tax.  Income tax is not something paid by the employer, it is paid by the employee.  The company might handle it, but they don't care if the tax goes up or down.  Neither is VAT.

If the banks move headquarters (and they haven't even decided that) they haven't claimed they are going to move staff (in fact, quite the opposite they've sent all their staff letters saying they won't).  So actually all that income tax, VAT and all the other employee tax would still remain in Scotland, it is just the corporation tax that wouldn't (and it wouldn't have done even if they hadn't moved head quarters because you have to pay tax where you do your business).

I have no idea what you mean by this.

London has more people, and fewer MPs than Scotland. The people of London consistently vote for left wing parties, just like the Scottish, and occasionally get right wing governments, just like the Scottish. London generates far, far more tax revenue than it receives in spending, while Scotland's budget deficit is approximately the same per-person as the rest of the UK

So, exactly how does London get a good deal from the current arrangement?

If Scots were railing against the oppression of Norfolk or Shropshire, then at least that would make sense - it's rural counties like that, which vote in all of the Tories.

&gt; The Scottish voted against AV

The campaign for AV was shambolic, people didn't know what they were voting for. Ask anybody to explain how it works and see if they can tell you. Also, Holyrood uses a different form of proportional representation to AV.

&gt; The unelected house of lords is actually incredibly useful

If the first house did its job properly (consulting experts and scientists, just as Holyrood do), then a second house wouldn't be necessary. The whole legislature process in Holyrood is much better than Westminster, in my opinion.

I watch a ton of Prem and MLS matches, and have done so for years, and I wouldn't say there's a noticeable discrepancy in pace of the match; if anything, MLS teams are much more relentless and box-to-box, whereas a number of Prem sides will sit on the ball and settle for early scores.

I'll start from the top as I have no idea what various peoples understanding of finance is. One of the banks roles in an economy is to regulate capital flowing out of the central bank and into the wider economy. Banks borrow at the cash rate and then charge a mark up on that rate (which varies according to how risky something is) to the people/entities they lend to.

So basically think of the banks as acting as a filtration system for the central bank which is otherwise a constantly flowing source of water (capital).

Pre 2008 the banks were too loose with who they allocated capital towards. This was an issue in the UK, particularly in the commercial sector, but they were shocking in the USA. So when house prices in the US finally fell a whole load of people defaulted on their mortgages and all the lovely instruments that the banks had created based on shoddy credit ratings went to crap and they ended up in a whole load of trouble. Or more specifically the insurers which they had sold these products too ended up in a huge amount of trouble.

So what happened next was completely understandable. Regulators around the western world tightened up regulations on banks dramatically. An understandable reaction given the circumstances.

The issue now arises because we have a situation whereby Western economies have recovered or at least stabilised and we've had 5 odd years of easy money (and huge amounts of QE) but the banks are unable to lend that money for fear of upsetting regulators. And they are right to be scared of regulators. [Banks (and other corporations) have been fair game for regulators for quite some time now.](http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21614101-corporate-america-finding-it-ever-harder-stay-right-side-law-mammoth-guilt)

The best example being Credit Agricole getting fined $9b for settling transactions for Iran. A deal in which they made $70m. The punishment is not fitting the crime.

[There is no shortage of liquidity in the European financial system](http://imgur.com/gNZCMkx). European officials know this as well. [Draghi is on record saying Europe desperately needs fiscal and structural reform](http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2014/09/how-europes-low-inflation-impedes-fiscal-and-structural-reform). And here's what Wolfgang Schauble had to say about liquidity in the system [*To be quite frank, I don’t think ECB monetary

Liquidity in markets is not too low, it is even
too high*](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-28/schaeuble-sees-draghi-s-instruments-for-growth-exhausted.html)

So, if people want to see a real recovery in Europe (and the UK to an extent) then we need to relieve the regulations on the banks. They need to feel safe and able to play their role in the economy. Because if they can't lend to the wider economy then there is no growth amongst the small and medium sized businesses.",0,1410455043,null,0,false,0,ckfgt5z,t3_2g146p,t1_ckfgt5z,t1_ckev688,null,1427070554,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

If you are in the situation or have recently been in the situation where you were unpaid consider claiming back wages through the courts. https://www.gov.uk/make-court-claim-for-money/overview

I've done two court claims, one against a shop, another against a former employer. I won both cases. It is a little daunting (I was very glad my dad came with me first time). It's exhilarating to see them go from bluster to panic to despair though. When I won my case against the employer the company owner was so pissed off he shut the company. (I was sacked the day after I gave a month's notice for being a troublemaker - I sued for the month's money).

I've also in my times threatened two other organisations with court and they settled on terms favourable to me both times.

now the problem you'll have is that at 17, the min wage job is is  £5.13 from 1st Oct - so you'll earn on a 35 hour week, after tax, about £700 a month. Even house sharing in london, you'll be lucky to find somewhere for £500, then with bills, council tax, travel , you'd have expenses that could be as high as £800 a month - kinda tricky. Of course you can try to minimise them, walk/cycle instead of using the tube etc.


so it really depends, if you can find a job that pays over minimum wage for your age (or perhaps, work 2 jobs), and a cheap house share , then it is doable, but finding that is going to be tricky. Once you are 21+ it gets easier since the min wage is £6.50 from 1st oct, so it'd be easier then.

Instead I ended up making a pretty good fist of working in the arts, largely with children, then (more or less) cheerfully accumulated a mortgage and children of my own, and predictably did so in near-constant penury. Being skint is a ballache; but I have a good but frugal lifestyle. There are some pretty significant niggles in my life right now, and there is No. Fucking. Way. I could have predicted this. Yet I've done some really interesting things, criss-crossed my wonderful country, and met all sorts of people.

I think back to my school days and wonder what happened to the kids in my year? I barely know, albeit there's the Oscar winner; the person who managed not to get murdered on VSO in Jamaica and subsequently moved there; one of my best friends who learned Russian and moved to Kiev - shudder; the two lads who just wanted to be Air Traffic Controllers, and probably are right now; and ... who else?

This would cause utter chaos. 

Quotes can be provided either way but often those saying Scotland would have to reapply outright have clear alternate agendas (the UK Government, Barrosso). Scotland manifestly is not the same as Turkey or Serbia or Albania and will not be treated the same as these countries.

In July 2014 Sionaidh Douglas-Scott, professor of European law and human rights at Oxford University and author of a book on EU constitution law stated ""Despite assertions to the contrary from UK lawyers, EU lawyers and EU officials, any future independent Scotland's EU membership should be assured, and its transition from EU membership as a part of the UK to EU membership as an independent Scotland relatively smooth and straightforward"" ",0,1410458402,null,0,false,0,ckfil6r,t3_2g3cxv,t1_ckfil6r,t1_ckfhpmb,null,1427069445,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

If you are unable to fill that quota, you must leave empty roster spots for those additional players.

They made the ruling that Man City had to reduce their total squad size to 21 without any reference at all to the foreign player rule.  That was their error.  At no time in the proceedings did they say ""wait, out of the squad you still have to maintain the quota.""  Since they didn't, but rule city can still have 17 foreign born players since that was not addressed in the punishment.  Stupid, but legal.

End result, City basically has the same team they would have registered regardless of FFP rulings.   Were there no ruling in place, they could still register the same team and be completely legit.

From the 1950s to the 1970s, Kim and other party theorists such as [Hwang Jang-yop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwang_Jang-yop) elaborated the *Juche* Idea into a set of principles that the [government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_North_Korea) uses to justify its policy decisions. Among these are a strong military posture and reliance on Korean national resources. *Juche* has been accused of being a form of [political religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_religion) despite North Korea's formal commitment to [state atheism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_atheism).

true,Spiruel,eng-cumberland,Cumberland,"&gt;Obviously Scotland doesn't have a large financial industry.

Scotland does have a large financial industry. It contributes 12.5% of its GDP. Big and influential financial players include Standard Life, Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of Scotland etc. 
Currently the Scottish Banking industry is more than 12 times its GDP.

This is why the lack of clear answers about currency union, RBS/Lloyds/Standard Life should be a massive cause for concern. With no central bank supporting an independent Scotland, its banks and insurance companies would be seen as risky investments. In my opinion, not very sustainable if you have a country which caters so much to finance.

true,Gungunum,null,null,"&gt;I wanted to do something sciency and technical, pursuing a salaried career and going off and having a fabulous time, with a woman but no kids to tie me down (children always terrified me), making shit loads of money so I wouldn't have to worry about it.

When I found out that I had an *actual* chemical imbalance in my brain, I swore that I would never father kids, and limit romantic involvement - It sounds extreme, but in my more manic moments I can be given to violent impulse, and I've spent a long time struggling with those aspects of myself (I think a mere perusal of my posting history would give you a fair idea of just how much. lol) - I couldn't live with the knowledge that I'd harmed someone. Since then I've kept my distance from women even when I've had the opportunity to date someone. Is it lonely? Eh. Sure. I don't think I could live with myself if I ever fathered a kid and they were like me though.

&gt;Instead I ended up making a pretty good fist of working in the arts, largely with children, then (more or less) cheerfully accumulated a mortgage and children of my own, and predictably did so in near-constant penury. Being skint is a ballache; but I have a good but frugal lifestyle. There are some pretty significant niggles in my life right now, and there is No. Fucking. Way. I could have predicted this. Yet I've done some really interesting things, criss-crossed my wonderful country, and met all sorts of people.

Any regrets?

&gt;I think back to my school days and wonder what happened to the kids in my year? I barely know, albeit there's the Oscar winner; the person who managed not to get murdered on VSO in Jamaica and subsequently moved there; one of my best friends who learned Russian and moved to Kiev - shudder; the two lads who just wanted to be Air Traffic Controllers, and probably are right now; and ... who else? I dunno, I get the Old Boys' emails from time to time, inviting me to pompous reunion dinners (public school doncha know?) that I always ignore.

The problem with pad brats is that we never really get to form ties. I did at one point go to school with Sophie Ellis-Bextor, but...The nature of my stepfather's job meant that keeping in touch with anyone is nigh impossible at best. The names that have stuck in my mind cause me to google them sometimes, but nothing of substance ever comes up.

&gt;Quick! Wine for the maudlin!!

I actually have a whisky on my shelf that I keep around to torture me. been there for a decade now - I imagine consider it cost £90 for the bottle, it should taste wonderful.

Deep water is a very subjective term, the definition is dependant on the context. [This link here](http://www.infield.com/Deep-and_Ultra_deepwater_Technologies_and_Markets.htm) defines deep water as 500-1499 m, and &gt;1500 m as ultra deep water, which is typical when referencing modern subsea technology. As technology has advanced the goal posts have changed; 150 m is no longer considered deep, they just keep that tag in the gulf of mexico and other areas for easy recognition.

Also see [this diagram](http://frack-off.org.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/deepwater-oil-drilling.png) that shows the pace of development in the last two decades. Technology exists today to drill over 3 km depths, but at the time North Sea oil started to become huge business, you were talking maximum depths of less than 100 m because of the limitations with technology available at the time.

That isn't to say that there aren't more oil reserves around Scotland, but in terms of probability, you have to look at the areas around the globe that have become viable with this new technology. The chances of richer oil reserves somewhere else in the world (i.e. off the west coast of Africa, east coast of South America) compared to what remains in the North sea is close to 100%, so it would represent an opportunity cost for a company like BP, Shell etc. to continue exploration and production in a less lucrative area (As even oil companies only have limited resources).",0,1410459390,null,0,false,0,ckfj3xo,t3_2fxryd,t1_ckfj3xo,t1_ckef368,null,1427069091,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;Compared to my thoughts when I was a kid, not even close. But kid's dreams are rarely realistic, and I think if 10 year old SP knew what I know now, she'd be okay with that.
Compared to when I was, say, 20, I'm actually doing okay. I was fresh out of a very unhealthy relationship and thought myself unlovable. I'd just dropped out of uni and thought myself a failure. I was becoming withdrawn from my friends and thought I'd be lonely forever. My eczema was out of control and I thought I was the ugliest woman that'd ever lived.

I think you're a lovely person. Most of you here treat me with either kindness or pity. It's nice to know someone other than my own voices will reply to me. lol I'm glad you got away from that kind of relationship; it's sad when you look at people and you *know* they're unhappy. If I had one wish for the world, it'd be that everyone could live in happiness. I even wish for peace on earth and good will towards men every christmas! It's kind of a tradition from when my mum would ask me what I wanted for christmas.

&gt;Don't get me wrong, it was a couple of years before I even felt like I could address any of that. First I bit the bullet and told my friends I'm an idiot: turns out they knew that and forgave me for it if I promised to acknowledge my idiocy in the future. I got my skin cleared the fuck up and actually followed the advice to keep it that way this time. I had a few more unsuitable relationships, but tried to learn things from them and apply them when I finally found a man worth applying them to. After several false starts I found non-soulcrushing employment; not my dream career, but an okay job. My next utterly terrifying step is to get back into education.

But the Yes campaign also faces legitimate criticism for the rose-tinted spectacles it wears when discussing Scotland's future - according to Salmond, everything will be the same (same money, same monarch, same BBC, same NHS, same jobs etc.), except everything will be much nicer, because Scotland will be independent. Salmond seems to completely ignore the fact that some negative outcomes are likely, and he is far too dismissive of them, as this comment (among others) illustrates - yes, it is unlikely that Scotland will end up defaulting, but it is a real possibility given the hard line that is currently being taken on his currency union suggestion, and although a default will be bad for (what's left of) Britain, it would be far worse for Scotland. Similarly, his claim that Scottish businesses leaving Scotland and setting up in London as just being ""bluffs"" is hopelessly naive. In the event of a Yes vote, financial markets will react very negatively, and Scottish companies will face the brunt of that. Relocation of headquarters (and therefore corporate taxes) makes good business sense; businesses aren't beholden to patriotism, but to their shareholders, and they will do what they need to do to protect shareholder interests.

I feel that because of the overwhelmingly optimistic tone that the Yes campaign has taken, they have essentially painted themselves into a corner - they cannot really acknowledge the possibility of any negative outcomes by this point because they have spent so long denying they exist, and any attempt to now come up with contingency plans of, ""well, this is what we will do if this happens"" will be interpreted by the voters in the worst way. Unfortunately, this means that the people of Scotland aren't getting the info they deserve to have on their future, and I think the uncertainty is the main thing standing in the way of a ""yes"" vote, so ultimately, the Yes campaign have shot themselves in their own foot.",0,1410459938,null,0,false,0,ckfjejw,t3_2g3a1p,t1_ckfjejw,t3_2g3a1p,null,1427068876,5,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,5

true,Quietuus,,"Anarchy in the UK, if it's not too much trouble","&gt;I commuted up to London for 3 years to work at Imperial College and became depressed at the resources London seemed to suck away from everywhere else like the glutton at a christmas table, while other parts of the country picked sadly at what was left of the carcass.

I came into this thread to make something like this point. I think that for many in the nationalist movements, it's not so much England they want to escape, but London. The weight of London unbalances the whole country; they overspend on Olympics facilities, urban regeneration schemes, massive transport projects and so on whilst the rest of the country is shutting down libraries and public toilets.

My perspective on this is fairly distinct. I'm from the Isle of Wight, which, whilst technically part of South East England, has a very distinct set of problems. There is not, at the moment (and never *really* has been historically) a serious Isle of Wight independence movement, though it's certainly a sentiment you hear expressed. It is constantly made clear that no one in government (including, for the most part, our MP) gives a shit about the Isle of Wight, or understands our problems. The Island is dying for want of one fairly small thing; subsidised ferry travel. Yet we have no way of even asking for it. What do we get instead? We have essential services moved to the mainland. We have heard talk about shutting the Island's only remaining A&amp;E department and moving obstetrics to the mainland. We have had a proposal to split the Isle of Wight constituency in two and merge the Western part with New Forest East. We have mass unemployment, whilst all but two of the Islands job centres have been shut, bus passes have been made impossible to obtain, and the Gov.uk jobsearch site has not been programmed to understand the Solent exists. It's almost impossible at times to feel like we are an actual, valid and valued part of the country, and I'm sure this sentiment is shared by many in other areas.

I can suggest an extremely long list of ways to solve these sorts of problems on both a local and national level, but they are all wildly improbable; they include things like 'complete voting reform' and 'direct democracy' and 'renationalise everything' and 'herd all the people out of London and distribute them equally across the rest of the country, then strip the ghost city of its cultural treasures and fire our nuclear stockpile at it.'

Sorry, got a bit carried away there.

Sure. Lets attribute Iniesta, Xavi, Puyol, Pedro, Messi, Pique, and fucking Henry talent to Guardiola. It must've taken a revolutionary man to see their talents... Right?

&gt;if you think he was handed the best team ever at Barcelona and just tweaked their style you are seriously misinformed.

Do you know that Guardiola managed Barca B before managing the first team? Do you also know that the only reason he brought up Pedro and Busquets up from Barca B was because he had managed them? For the record, he did not bring up any other youth players. Barely brought Thiago in (who he had also coached at Barca B), who eventually left because he wasn't getting enough games. 

Then left like a coward when he had to rebuild that side, which by the way, wasn't even as big of a rebuild as before. It goes to show how poor his man management skills are that he couldn't even get his team motivated enough after ONE CL-semi final defeat.

If a manager like Rijkaard can coach a Barca team to CL title and La Liga titles, for someone like Guardiola to win whatever they won with the team that they had was a piece of cake.

Your holding fee should NOT be unrefundable, but check the wording on the contract/statement you signed when you paid them the money.

Get out get out get out! And then be much more cautious in future. 

And if you can't get the £400 back, I'm afraid that's just bad luck, if you stay in the contract because you're worried about losing that much, you'll just find yourself out on your arse in X months time having lost a fuck of a lot more and with nowhere to live.
