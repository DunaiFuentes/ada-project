This is a well written break down of FFP and exactly what it means for Chelsea.

The short version is that Chelsea spent a ton of money and took all their huge losses before FFP existed and built the brand to be self substaining.  More or less we are golden with regaurds to FFP and all FFP does is insure our place as a top side in Europe will continue.  FFP is also the reason we are trying to buy young stars such as Hazard and Oscar.  Their transferr fee gets reammortized out each time we extend their contract which reduces their FFP cost (although it can go up due to wages)  Take Hazard, we bought him for 32m (ammortized over 5 years at 6.4m/yr) and he currently makes 185k/wk (all numbers in pounds) so roughly a FFP cost of 16,020,000 per year.  If we redo his contract this off season we will have already accounted for 12.8m of his transfer fee from the first 2 years and would only need to include the remaining 19.2 over the next 5 year contract.  So with a new 200k/wk salary over 5 years Hazard's FFP cost would actually drop to about 14.2m/yer

FFP is also the reason you see chelsea buying a boat load of young talent.  The goal there is that every now and then we get lucky and develope a talent that is actually good enough for the Chelsea first team, but the hope is we buy them young and cheap, develop them in the academy or via loan and then sell them for a profit to help support the acquisition of proven talent for the first team.",0,1402667729,null,0,1402668129,0,ci6jiwb,t3_281sex,t1_ci6jiwb,t3_281sex,null,1434221456,4,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,4

And in one sentence you demonstrate your entire knowledge of the concentration camp system built by the Nazis. The reality is that the internment camps, while different to Dachau and similar camps in Europe were not so entirely different than you think.

Dachau changed a lot over time. Initially it was a prison for political prisoners, mostly consisting of SPD and KPD members, and was then pretty much almost closed in the mid-30s. When it was reopened control passed from the Bavarian PD to the SS where it was the first SS-run concentration camp. It was used to intern unwanted people (Jehovas Witnesses, Roma, Sinti, Homosexuals, Priests, Jews etc.) and as a work camp. The camp's expansion was actually built by prisoners. It was also used as a training ground for new SS prison guards, who were encouraged to take the 'Dachau spirit' to other camps. Later the camp was expanded again and it's role changed again. Instead of housing prisoners permanently, Dachau was mainly used to hold prisoners for onward transport. Although it had it's own gas chambers as far as we know it was not used for mass murder.

Dachau's early prisoners were mostly German, but after the annexation of Poland and Czechoslovakia an influx of Polish prisoners made for the majority of prisoners.

I haven't been to the japanese-american internment camps, but from what I've read the conditions in some of the WRC camps seemed to have much in common with a better funded and more spacious form of Dachau I (before the SS took over).

On a final note about death at Dachau. Some prisoners (especially Jews) were considered less than human and were killed for no good reason (usually under the guise of disobeying orders or breaching the prison code), but many people died at Dachau because of the conditions there. The camp was originally designed to house 8,000 but even with expansion at the end of the war over 32,000 inmates were there. The bodies couldn't be cremated quickly enough to stop disease from spreading, particularly typhus which was rampant throughout the camp.",0,1402667826,null,0,false,0,ci6jk9k,t3_281cwx,t1_ci6jk9k,t1_ci6id6j,null,1434221474,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I know a lot of schools will enforce a 'no nut' rule and i'd imagine their catering would also take that into account.

Shopping at a supermarket, most things are labeled if they contain anything that may annoy someone.  

I think it would really depend from restaurant to restaurant. You'll find some people who don't have a clue but most places will not be surprised that someone has an allergy.

China never joins in. Russia does the opposite of everyone else. Most of Europe is too pacifist (or something) to help out people in desperate need of their help due to requiring violence. And what you have is the US and a few other countries using questionable premises, questionable means, and with questionable ends to achieve something that any good person should genuinely want.

As short sighted as the US &amp; co. may or have not have been, the goal of ridding Saddam and bringing ""freedom"" to Iraq is not a bad thing in and of itself. The US wanted much more support than it got. And if it had got it then Iraq would be in a far better position right now.

Yet people blame those who tried instead of those who couldn't be bothered trying. Pretty sure that violates the concept behind countless wise proverbs!

Not mine, and in any case no evil dictator has ever come to power under completely different circumstances than he's ended up in. For example, nobody said 'hey, let's stick this guy in, he'll gas lots of Kurds for us'.

&gt;so I don't think you can come here from a moral high ground.

I didn't, that's another assumption of *yours*. I was generally highlighting how pointless it is to polarise things, because it means worthwhile arguments get ignored. 

&gt; Your mention of torture is especially ironic, by the way.

I didn't mention torture. But do explain when/ where our use of it has been anywhere near the same level as that used by Saddam.

&gt; As for religious differences going on there: true, there were always frictions in the region, however, you and the US made it damn sure these were nurtured during the Cold War.

Hence they didn't just leave, and tried to put a democratic process in place - which leads back to my point about automatically rejecting any positive aspects as saying more about you than the subject.

Saddam had no say in the war. The inspectors were inspecting; they were given every permission needed. They themselves said that. They said they needed more time. The US/UK was so bent on war, they did not care. 2003 was only 11 years ago. Do you suffer from amnesia?

Saddam -and other US/UK propped and supported dictators- ARE YOUR RESPSONSIBILITY. If you let these people loose, what they end up doing, is on you. Not to mention if you don't want them to gas people, DON'T FUCKING SELL THEM THE TECHNOLOGY. Which you did.

Torture... black prisons? Kidnappings? Nowhere on the same level? So there are levels here? Not just war crimes? Interesting. Do tell, how much institutionalized torture is acceptable? (By the way, who do you think trained Saddam's people during the 80s? Take a guess.) Come to think of it, how big genocide is acceptable? How many people can you murder in a death camp before you become an embarrassment in social circles? (The Mau Mau uprising comes to mind...)

You are wildly deluded if you think ""you've put a democratic process in place"". I mean this sort of delusion is so big I'm not even sure how to address it. 

1. you cannot impose democracy, especially not on gunpoint

2. it was not democratic. during a civil war there is no possibility of democracy by definition, AND the US/UK made it damn sure the elections were not exactly democratic. There are a lot of articles about this in Rolling Stone, Guardian, whatever, so if you have not read about it, I can only assume willful ignorance. I only thought Southern Rednecks have this sort of mindset; I'm really surprised to find it in the UK. I guess you guys are more alike than I thought.

true,FreddyDeus,yorkshire,Ayup,"UKIP is not about 'just keeping foreigners out'. Yes, the Politically Correct 'liberal' left like to damn anyone who even mentions immigration as being egregiously racist. But putting aside their pious nonesense, UKIP's central policy is succession from the European Union.

Their immigration issue is not about keeping out *all* foreigners. It is about the unrestricted movement of people throughout Europe, with particular emphasis on those new members from former Eastern Block countries. And there is a reasonable argument for doing so that has nothing to do with racism or xenophobia.

If you are one of those skilled or semi-skilled workers who has seen your hourly pay rate drop (wage compression), you are far more likely to feel sympathetic to UKIP's stance on unlimited economic migration from economically destitute EU member nations.

If, like me, you have a professional occupation, you might not care so much. Or if you run your own business and benefit from being able to pay £6.50 per hour for skilled labour that would previously have cost you £15 per hour, then you might find yourself very much in favour of unlimited economic migration from these countries.

This is why organisations such as the Institute of Directors and the CBI love Poles and Bulgarians coming to work in Britain, and actively campaign for Turkey to be allowed EU membership (the next untapped pool of cheap labour).

How could you get caught for possession if drugs were legalised? 

&gt; it does make me more qualified to comment on it's effects, having experienced them first hand.

Precisely. You think you know better than everyone else just because you have taken the drug. How does that make you any more qualified to talk about the social effects legalisation might have? 

&gt;Making something legal isn't like putting up a giant sign saying ""THIS DRUG IS SAFE IT'S LEGALLLL"". 

If you specifically change the law on a particular drug, with all the media attention it would receive, you are telling people that t drug is safe and legal. Why else would the government agree to legalise it? The number of people smoking weed in Colorado has increased dramatically in the last year. 

&gt;Well we'll see how you enjoy using them from a prison cell because of your one sided view that the government should take the place of your mum and spoonfeed you the things that you are allowed to ingest.

It already does this. There are many foods, drinks, drugs (legal and illegal) and supplements that we control based on our best information, because of the effects they can have on the body. Do you know what the long term effects of MDMA abuse has on the brain, heart and liver?

&gt;The fact that you have been continuously downvoted shows that you are thankfully in the minority on this one. 

The demographic of reddit is skewed, and anyway, I have yet to hear an argument for the total legalisation of drugs that is convincing, and neither has the rest of the population of the UK, seeing as the are still illegal. 


&gt;When I said younger generation, I was speaking for the majority of the younger generation, sure there will always be a few people with opposing views, the key word is few.

Where is this majority of the younger generation? I meet plenty of stoner's and ravers, who spend most of their lives trying to get high, who will drone on and on at you about how weed and MDMA are such great drugs, and how the world would be such a better place if they were legal, but the way they live their lives is an excellent example of why these drugs should remain illegal. 

Sensible drug users are able to recognise that while there are many great substances that can do amazing things, they are very easy to abuse, and they would not mix well with the general public. I've seen many normal people become worthless lazy layabouts because of drugs, it is very easy for it to happen to a person, and we as a society do have a duty to protect people from that fate, I'm sorry if that makes it a bit harder for you to get high on the weekends.  

&gt;I'd settle for decriminalisation, 

As would I. Weed is already essentially decriminalised, its just that no government has the balls to come out and make it official. 


&gt;I know, I never said Portugal legalised them, I was showing that they took a step towards where I believe they should be and are better off for it.

Your article is very selective with the data it reports. It mentions:

&gt;rates of lifetime use of any illegal drug among seventh through ninth graders fell from 14.1% to 10.6%;

But it fails to mention that overall use of illegal drugs rose from 7.8% to 12%, data taken from the same report the article is citing.  It mentions that deaths related to heroin fell, but does not mention that overall deaths related to drug use has risen.

People who argue against the deposition of Hussain so frequently attempt to do so by muddying the water, by listing all of the bad things that the west has done, presumably to try to demolish what they see as a position of over-arching moral supremacy.

And you can't claim moral high ground for doing nothing about it, either.

&gt;But instead of cleaning it out, you shat another one in the middle.

Not even sure what this means.

&gt;Saddam had no say in the war. 

Sure, in no way was there ten years between his invading Kuwait and the invasion of Kuwait.

&gt; The inspectors were inspecting; they were given every permission needed. 

No, they weren't. Go read the wiki.

&gt;They themselves said that. 

See above.

&gt; They said they needed more time. 

Why, if they were given everything they needed?

&gt;The US/UK was so bent on war, they did not care.

After ten years and being attacked, that's correct.

&gt;2003 was only 11 years ago. Do you suffer from amnesia?

Says the guy who asserts that inspectors had no issues.

&gt;Saddam -and other US/UK propped and supported dictators- ARE YOUR RESPSONSIBILITY. 

You can't follow this line and then assert we shouldn't have done anything about him.

&gt; If you let these people loose, what they end up doing, is on you.

That depends on whether they begin a monster or evolve into one.

&gt;Not to mention if you don't want them to gas people, DON'T FUCKING SELL THEM THE TECHNOLOGY. Which you did.

You're suggesting they wouldn't have procured gas from anywhere else?

&gt;Torture... black prisons? Kidnappings? Nowhere on the same level? So there are levels here? Not just war crimes? Interesting. 

Experimenting on humans? Pretending they didn't have schemes going on that they did? It's all in the wiki.

&gt;Do tell, how much institutionalized torture is acceptable? (By the way, who do you think trained Saddam's people during the 80s? Take a guess.)

Not sure I said anywhere that it was; you're doing it again. A conversation is harder with someone that's on a soapbox.

&gt; Come to think of it, how big genocide is acceptable? How many people can you murder in a death camp before you become an embarrassment in social circles? (The Mau Mau uprising comes to mind...)

Damn, the soapbox is higher than I thought. Can you hear me? Can we stick to the events at hand, or shall I mention the romans again?

&gt;You are wildly deluded if you think ""you've put a democratic process in place"".

I guess the upcoming elections must be part of my delusion.

&gt;you cannot impose democracy, especially not on gunpoint

I'd suggest you cannot *sustain* democracy at gunpoint.

&gt;it was not democratic. during a civil war there is no possibility of democracy by definition

Are you talking about the elections now, or at the point of defeat?

&gt; There are a lot of articles about this in Rolling Stone, Guardian, whatever, so if you have not read about it, I can only assume willful ignorance.

You mean like asserting inspectors had no problems at any point?

Well this is where we disagree then. I place the protection of innocent life above the rights of murderers and rapists - You don't. 

&gt; And you frighten me. A woman who discovers that her child has been hurt by someone and kills that person; she should be locked up forever?

A person debating you on the internet frightens you? Grow up. No the woman should be free, if someone murders your child and you kill them in the heat of the moment, that's fine.

&gt; An 18 year-old man from a troubled background who rapes his girlfriend in the back of a car. He sorts his head out in prison and is a peaceful, literate 40 year-old; he's going to stay there forever?

Well for 25 years, yes. He had a chance to lead a normal happy life but he decided to commit a monstrous crime. That girl will now always have been raped. I have zero compassion for rapists. 

&gt;You are ruthless, but also naive to the complex realities of the world. 

So anyone that disagrees with you is ruthless? You can call me naive if you like, if that means I place the protection of innocents above the rights of rapists and murderers, then I am happy to be be naive.

&gt;Do you really think that what you propose is just?

Yes. Do you consider letting rapists and murderers carry out more rape and murders just?

&gt; Do you really think that studies find that people can't be rehabilitated?

Nope, never claimed that as much as I'm sure you'd like me to. 

&gt;Do you think that it's healthy for a society to lock up so many people? 

No, I believe we need radical changes to the drugs laws so our prisons aren't filled up with petty criminals. Prison should be reserved for serious criminals, like you know, rapists and murderers.

&gt;I ask these questions genuinely, and hope that you will think about them.

I have no doubt. I would like you to think about the hypothetical innocent person that you sentenced to death in order to provide freedom to murderers.

&gt;Cook's resignation speech in the House of Commons received an unprecedented standing ovation by fellow MPs, was described by the BBC's Andrew Marr as ""without doubt one of the most effective, brilliant resignation speeches in modern British politics."" Most unusually for the British parliament, Cook's speech was met with growing applause from all sides of the House (beginning with Labour and Liberal Democrat critics of the war), and from the public gallery. According to The Economist's obituary, that was the first speech ever to receive a standing ovation in the history of the House.

That's what it turned into. That's what happens when you build an underclass hated by society, discriminated against for their accent and their looks with no realistic prospects and no reason to behave by your rules. That's what happens when you pump adverts at children and plaster every available surface in their city with professionally calibrated instructions constantly telling them they need to get thing X, buy thing Y and wear thing Z if they want to be respected or feel fully human.  


What it started as was (as it looked on the ground at the time) the apparent gunning down of a civilian by police in the streets, authority figures refusing to answer questions, followed by seemingly framing the victim by planting a gun and then ineptly covering up the evidence. Even now, post-inquiry, the picture is pretty murky. In the fog of war it looked pretty bad. 

Imagine a similar situation unfolding where the murder victim was [someone like you who you can relate to better], the government is [a party you don't like] and the police are [a powerful organisation that you have no reason to trust]. Try and do anything about it and you'll get stamped back into your hole where the society that hates you think you belong. Recipe for a police state. 

I don't really blame the later kids for wanting to scrabble out of their hole for a couple of days, since they know they're going to spend the rest of their lives in it.

true,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"&gt; And there is a key difference- Suarez's instances are instinctual madness. Rooney engages in deliberate, dangerous play

I don't get how this is a defence. Suarez has bitten players twice, one of which was on the shoulder/neck too. I honestly don't get how you can be like ""Rooney is nasty and deliberately kicks people in the legs, whilst Suarez is innocent because he only completely loses himself and sinks his teeth into people"". He's cleaned himself up these days, but I totally could have seen Suarez kicking a player like that if we were having a shitty day on the pitch.

I wouldn't say Rooney was a particularly clean player, but he's not that bad and he's certainly not got a track record of needlessly being violent towards people in the same way the likes of Duncan Ferguson, Keane, Bellamy did. He's lashed out a few times when frustrated, but so have Gerrard, Carragher, and plenty of other players you'd typically regard as being pretty clean and level-headed. Zidane did it in a world cup final. It doesn't inherently make him a violent/dirty player imho, and at the very least it doesn't make him any worse than the likes of Suarez. 

Man Utd have had some grade-A cunts in the last few years - Keane, Scholes, Neville, Young, Valencia, Evra... but I probably wouldn't class Shrek as one of them. He shags grannies, and it is kind of amusing to see him wound up when the game isn't going well for Utd, but he's one of the lesser evils in their side and he's no worse than most other British tough-upbringing players.

&gt; Why should I *have* to get adjusted to anything?

If you're rich, them perhaps you won't have to - unless the mythical ""Communist revolution"" happens any time soon, they'll probably give you a pat on the back and let you do whatever you like. Well, at least for a long while after you're dead and gone.

For the rest of us, this is an impending problem that needs to be dealt with one way or another, and what'll likely happen is that this country will go the way of Singapore - smashing down the current houses which are too overly-spacious and instead cramming people into high-rise buildings.

They supply and maintain the *missiles* (Trident D5). But the UK is responsible for the design, manufacture, testing and maintenance of the *warheads* on those missiles. **edit:** I see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Trident_programme#Warheads) casts doubts on the independence of the UK warhead design, but does not dispute the manufacture and maintenance.

But news like this is hardly surprising: we're down to having a single active design of our own (that's at least 20 years old), so maintaining the skills and experience that would let us build the next one (for whatever replaces Trident, presumably) is obviously on people's mind.

This is a very similar situation to the Attack Submarine fiasco - the decision to replace the *Trafalgar* class was delayed so long we lost the skills necessary to do so, and had to go cap in hand to the US for help designing the *Astute* class that's now entering service.

I find it hard to understand how you can still think I don't have any first and experience at this point. 

&gt;Not at all, you're telling people the drug is legal, not that it's safe.

Alcohol is legal, and its safe, people still ruin their lives with it, there are alcoholics, depressed people who use alcohol as a coping mechanism. MDMA has a very strong potential to be used like that, and the effects on those people would be devastating. 

&gt;Yes I know they already do this, I'm saying I don't agree with it, I must have reiterated that point at least 5 times by now.

I understand that YOU personally don't think the government should interfere with what people put in their bodies, I'm making the point that most people would disagree with you. Most people think its a good thing that not just anything can be labelled as safe to consume and given out freely to the public, and that there is regulation on some things, and others are banned outright. 

&gt;Like I said, this is currently in the process of changing with the shifting generations. 

Maybe, but that doesn't mean its the right thing to do. I know plenty of stupid people who haven't considered the social effect of drug legalisation, who would vote for legalisation, and they have every right to vote. 

On the other hand I have many intelligent friends who I discuss issues like this with regularly, and they share my opinion that total legalisation of drugs would be a very bad thing for society.

Two quotes from the man himself, one in 78, ""[The Ba'ath Party must] oppose the institutionalization of religion in the state and society. . . . Let us return to the roots of our religion, glorifying them–but not introduce it into politics""

That shows he intended a secular government by your definitions, and,

true,confusedpublic,null,null,"&gt;You don't know any of that.

Well, I know just as much as you, so I don't see the point in flinging that around. It's all educated guesses.

If you're using that to dismiss my point concerning pay out of hand like that, then I can your claims that he'd be happy with the same pay or less.

There're three reasons for him wanting a pay rise. First, he doesn't want to leave City as it's his boyhood club so would want more money to make up for him leaving. Second, at 25 it'll probably be his last big contract, so he'll want to maximise his earnings while he still can. He'll sign a 4ish year contract if he moves, which'll put him 29/30 when it ends, after which he can't expect another pay rise and expect a pay cut. Third, why leave when he can stay for another year and earn more, then take the signing on bonus where ever he goes next, and have more choice in where he goes?

I was under the impression that Johnson was earning £100k a week, so I was mistaken about that. [The Echo](http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/sport-opinion/james-pearce-liverpool-fc-owners-6287987) says he is earning ""over £110k"" a week. So okay, he might save a bit more money than my initial estimate, but only if he doesn't have a pay rise. This point depends on the first, and your assertion that there'd be a saving of £60k a week depends on the assumption that he'd not ask for more money, which we can dismiss out of hand in the same way.

I had a google of prices, and have seen them ranging from £5-8m, but also rumours of his wage being £70k. So that's all a wild guess too. My price wasn't that far off, and was predicated on Man City replacing some of their home grown players. That means it included an implicit context dependence that if city sold more of their home grown players, then the price of the rest of their home grown players would go up.

For me, any price is ridiculous for a player who's played less games than there's been months of active football in the last two seasons. With that little football, any youth player can provide sufficient cover. We've also Kelly (at the moment), and Wisdom who can cover if we're pressed.

There's also no chance he'd sign up to be a back up option if he actually wants to leave City, as it would be to play some football. Especially for less money (that's 4 possible reasons for him to ask for more money.) And there's nothing to show he can replace Johnson.

The unknowns are too great concerning his ability to actually perform. The estimated costs are too high. Sure you can dismiss my comments due to me ""not knowing"" any of it, but you can dismiss everyone else's. The one thing we do know is that he's played *no football* over 2 years, and going off that one fact means we should go no where near him.",0,1402676991,null,0,false,0,ci6npav,t3_281qrc,t1_ci6npav,t1_ci6m436,null,1434223500,-1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,-1

The problem is, the kind of change required to turn NK into a developed nation takes generations if done peacefully. War may affect more instant change, but at what consequence? More war?

The mindset of the average North Korean is one of *total* reverence to their leader. Yes, some people know how shit life there is, but don't underestimate the mind-job the Jongs have done to their people. If we did decide to go to war to make the place better, how many people and families would have to be blown up before they relent? People of that mindset stay suicidally opposed to their enemy. It would totally play into the hands of Kim Jong Un as well. All he'd have to say is 'look, here are the American dogs coming to rape and pillage'. If anyone was unsure before, they sure as shit would look to 'dear leader' for help at that point. It'd be a bloodbath for them, obviously.

You're looking at about £40-£50 per person, per leg with the itinerary you describe, which isn't nothing, but you can get it a bit lower with advance tickets.

If buying tickets, you should buy a two-together rail card: http://www.twotogether-railcard.co.uk/ to get 1/3 off tickets for £30. That is available on-the-day at any manned rail station, or online in advance. The discount is only valid where two people are travelling together, which sounds ideal for you.

Personally, I prefer getting off-peak and super-off-peak tickets as it doesn't constrain me to travel at a particular time, there's little worse when travelling in the UK than missing a train and having to pay both the cheap fare and the on-the-spot fare.

I agree. I think, the illegality of this war diminishes what is otherwise a cause worth fighting for.

I agree with your points on NK too, and in a bizarre way the transition to democracy presents very similar problems to those in Iraq, and probably most other Middle Eastern dictatorships, though it obviously varies by country.

We have no idea how to bring an utterly uninformed public - especially one which has been intentionally kept that way and brainwashed - into a democratic state. War works, but is terribly costly (economically, temporally and financially). Hussein, Assad, Jong-Il, none of them would give up power voluntarily, and all would happily fight back against Western militaries, and rally their public with them as you say.

Back to NK specifically - I totally agree that war would be a bad idea (short lived, though it would be). The only saving grace, in a sense, is that most of their military are only their because it's the only viable job, have no experience and poor training.

true,wherearemyfeet,null,null,"&gt;I am basing my opinions on my experiences. I've met and befriended numerous homeless people - former associates who have since lost their accommodation for one reason or another - and, out of these people, few of them are drug users, and none of them have (to my knowledge) shit or pissed inappropriately.

That's why I used the phrase ""long-term homeless"". The people who end up homeless because of a series of unfortunate events (job loss, divorce, repossession) will more often than not find themselves back on their feet within a couple of years at most. I don't have any official figures, but personal experience tells me that at least 4 out of 5 of these people get back on their feet. These people are *not* long-term homeless.

Long-term homeless are people who have been there for years and, due to a combination of untreated mental health problems and addictions, will probably stay there for years to come despite society's best efforts and intentions.

&gt;I have never volunteered at a homeless shelter (although I have volunteered at youth groups with homeless youths), but I base my interpretation of the homeless based upon the homeless individuals I've experienced.

Feel free to contact Shelter and give it a go. Your experience is very limited if you've only experienced individuals who have ""merely"" fallen on hard times, you've only encountered the pretty and media-friendly minority of cases. I don't say that patronisingly either. I mean that from years of experience with the whole spectrum of homeless people, I can tell you that you've experienced nothing more than the ""light"" section. Definitely not enough to base an informed opinion on.

&gt;You seem to be a man who has spent so long working with the disenfranchised, that you have dehumanised them, and are likely a conservative man who believes that if they just didn't piss and shit themselves then they would be rich and famous in our so-called ""meritocratic"" society.

Funny, I've not made a single assumption about you. I called you teenage because you're 19. You said so less than a month ago. I called you naive because you genuinely believe that letting the long-term homeless stay in your house, without any access to specialised mental health treatment, won't end in your house being damaged (at the least), you being attacked and your stuff sold for gear, and the only reason you believe this is because you've simply not had the first-hand experience of the people we're talking about. That's not me being a bitter old man (I don't call being 28 old), that's what I've seen every day in my years working with the long-term homeless.",0,1402680644,null,0,false,0,ci6pkhk,t3_27yk3d,t1_ci6pkhk,t1_ci6gaxm,null,1434224380,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

If a person is later found not guilty (new evidence, appeal etc) then they can still be released and compensated, unlike if they're dead.

I've never liked this line of reasoning.  How do you compensate someone for a couple of decades of their lives that they'll never get back?  If they were imprisoned during their 20s, 30s or 40s how do you compensate them for the family they will now probably never have?  If you send someone to prison for a long period, you fuck their life.  Yeah you can tell them how sorry we all are, and give them a nice big wad of cash (which seems to be more about salving our societal conscience then anything else) but you can't give back what you took from them, any more than you can give a hanged man back his life.

http://www.kroll.com/media/Kroll_Due_Diligence_on_supply_chain_Human_Trafficking.pdf

Supply chain due diligence is a growing sector, in particular;

- crude from sanctioned countries. (my sector)
- conflict diamonds
- conflict minerals
- slave labour, in particular issues with Russian logging (North Korean ""contract labour"") and Thai fishing industries.

Anyone in the above industries should know these issues. It's *impossible* the Thai guy is ignorant of what is going on, the Thai issues have been well documented for years. The Guardian piece might have raised the profile, but this isnt new information.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"&gt;I've told you me view on that. Your COULD was not supported by any explanation, hence I had full right to react like that as I can't PREDICT what you possibly have in mind...

But you actually said that we weren't talking about could but would...then you said 'bullshit'.   

You could have asked for clarification, but instead you said 'bullshit' knowing that you were going on pure speculation on your part.

When I clarified you admitted that 'could' applied.  I simple 'sorry, in this regard' and 'let us move on' would suffice.

&gt;It doesn't matter, I attack arguments which I think are idiotic and I don't care whether they come from you or from organisation.

It does matter when you use an organisation for your argument only to find out they stand for something else.  

Feel free to disagree with them, but it negates your previous argument when you tried to use them on the exact same criteria.

&gt;So? Again, look above.

The 'So?' is that you aren't able to back up your arguments, whereas I can.  What I'm arguing for is backed up by some of the same groups, for the same organisation, of the system which you wanted to argue for.

&gt;I don't have any data on that so can't confirm nor deny. Nor does you or the GMC (they are afraid because they think those might not be good enough, not because they have facts).

We very much do have data on it.  We have data on all health systems.

It's not out there that countries that are more prosperous, more developed, are able to pay into their healthcare systems and education advantageously and get some return on their results.

&gt;It seems you have missed my quote from the article which said it was ""GMC's interpretation"", not that the EU forbid them doing so. Maybe GMC was so rubbish they couldn't interpret it in correct way for such a long time?

Nope.  It's not the GMC's interpretation.  They're a regulatory body.  The UK government can interpret EU regulation, and it must uphold EU directives.  Both of these are open to the ECJ interpretation which doesn't sit well with UK common law even though it was set up on a common law basis - as EU common law doesn't mean the same thing as UK common law.

This is why it would be better for the UK to go through an EFTA court where a UK Common Law wise judge would have to preside.

&gt;You again seem to miss the difference between ""education standards"" to ""general standard of offered services"". In fact, education standards can very truly be higher in poorer countries, due to number of reasons. 

I appreciate you now go into a series examples, but those same examples are examples of service above an average standard.  I appreciate that some poorer countries may have very high standards (there's a reason after all why there is health-tourism to places like Poland and Malta from the UK) - but that's why I didn't use Poland or Malta as an example.  I used Bulgaria.  Bulgaria has particularly poor levels of care, but to take Bulgaria into consideration for a bar minimum in which Bulgaria would have to be included means that the UK and Poland will be disproportionately affected.

&gt;Yeah, right, everything which doesn't support your agenda is now somehow unconnected or ""Mr Farage actually meant something different"", just like when he said he ""wouldn't like to live next to Romanian people"". Nice.

No.  Not really.  It's just that you didn't have a grasp on what had been proposed.  Farage argued Blair had gone too far.  It was John Major post-Dunblane that put new measures in place.  Blair simply went on to include single shot sporting pistols into the ban.  Farage said that Blair, not Major, went too far.

You admitted you weren't particularly informed on this subject.  I merely told you that you weren't and best to leave it alone until you were.",0,1402681462,null,0,1402686100,0,ci6pzhh,t3_27m2id,t1_ci6pzhh,t1_ci6hn4v,null,1434224576,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The LD50 for ethanol in rats (dosage at which 50% die) is 7 grams/kg body weight, so if we assume an average adult weight of 70 kg would be a lethal dosage of 490 g. 

Tequila is typically 40% abv, and a shot is 25 mL, so that's 10 mL ethanol /shot.

The density of ethanol is 0.789 g/cm3, so 10 mL = 7.89 g.

&gt;After the memorial service for the twentieth anniversary of the [Hillsborough disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsborough_disaster) in April 2009, complaints were made by members of the congregation that Itandje had been laughing and behaving inappropriately during the service.  His actions were condemned by the Liverpool hierarchy, [*[who?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_words)*] who stated that they would be seeking to impose the maximum punishment possible.  Itandje apologised to the grieving families and to Liverpool fans for his behaviour and was suspended by the club for 14 days.  He did not play another game, at reserve or first team level, for the club. Following his move to Atromitos, Itandje apologised emphatically:

Do try and read what I'm saying and address that, instead of agenda-ising me to the point where I'm wondering who you're replying to.

&gt;Go read some fucking books, butcho, then come back to me.

Yes, I'll start with the *fucking* Roman invasion of England and trace all the blame back to that. Or at least, I would if I were unable to separate the two. And...er...'butcho'? We really aren't at school. Grow up.

&gt;Here are some suggestions

How about sticking to the subjects in hand, like providing links to the wiki article that (in order to agree with your summary) states the weapon inspectors encountered no issues, were not refused entry to specific sites, were held against their will until they gave up materials the Iraqi government had changed their minds about allowing? Did none of that actually happen, now, and someone's just forgotten to update wiki?

&gt;Seriously. You have no excuse for being an ignorant idiot.

And you have no excuse for being insulting in advance. To anyone. Certainly when you have to address them as their own government in order to take the high ground (and then berate me for supposedly holding it when nobody has mentioned it apart from, er, you). 'Seriously'.

He will probably play CAM every now and then, but it's not going to be why he is here. Mourinho likes players who are quick, strong, and willing to track back (when it comes to his offensive players). Cesc is none of that, you could argue quick. Being in a pivot will give him more freedom to not track back (if any) and be slower.

My process was: I did my CBT, and then my theory a few weeks later. Then I chose a training school. The school [xs rider training](http://www.xsrts.co.uk/)- they have prices on there, put me on a 125 to see my ability as I hadn't done my CBT through them which was one lesson essentially. Then it was a 3-4 lessons (experience/ability will vary this) over a few weeks around my schedule and I passed my mod 1, then I had another lesson and my mod 2 - passed.

Two of my friends have recently done the same, both passed first time and one of them had zero motorcycle experience.

Tips: Mod 1 - Practise the U-Turn over and over. It seems to get everyone and on test day I was mm away from white line. 

Mod 1 - Try practise with a school that has a speed gun, most do. Iirc I think it was 31mph and it feels surprisingly fast to begin with.

Mod 2 - Just treat the examiner as a Sat Nav. I had him in a car behind me but after a few minutes id got in the zone and was nice and relaxed.

true,pharao007,null,null,"&gt;You could have asked for clarification, but instead you said 'bullshit' knowing that you were going on pure speculation on your part.

You could have clarified that from the beginning as then I wouldn't have to figure out something which you clearly knew very well, while I did NOT know about, hence my point is still valid as it was based on information provided by yourself and my view of the topic. As soon as you clarified that I have acknowledged it is viable. I don't see anything wrong with my reaction, which was appropriate for the information provided to myself. It was in your interest to prove me otherwise by giving that particular single reason... which you couldn't give in your first response, not sure why.

It's an Internet discussion, don't expect people to behave like British gentleman and ask themselves with phrases of ""Would you care explaining to me your brilliant idea?"". I've called your statement bullshit, based on information provided and had absolute right to do that. You also lack kind approach and have shown it couple of times in just this discussion.

&gt;It does matter when you use an organisation for your argument only to find out they stand for something else.

I have been using them as an example, not an argument. It was also in quite a different context.

&gt;Feel free to disagree with them, but it negates your previous argument when you tried to use them on the exact same criteria.

Nope, look above.

&gt;The 'So?' is that you aren't able to back up your arguments, whereas I can. What I'm arguing for is backed up by some of the same groups, for the same organisation, of the system which you wanted to argue for.

You say to yourself that you can and I disagree, simple as that. I was referring to GMC and HPC in order to tell you that somehow EU doesn't force everybody to automatically recognise everything that is European, as otherwise they would be doing so with everything else. In fact, there is UCAS which finds UK's equivalents of non-UK education levels.

I am still not convinced that GMC was one day told by the EU, that ""you need to recognise medical qualifications because we just say so"". It was certainly somehow researched and implemented with connection to relevant bodies and or/departments. It may be though that GMC wasn't fully satisfied of that because I don't know, maybe they don't trust the EU in relation to setting up those standards or want controls which aren't really necessary but ""they just want these"" because of unknown reasons as statistics of struck off tell us that issue actually lies somewhere else.

&gt;We very much do have data on it. We have data on all health systems.

And the usual data includes what exactly? Does it focus on learning standards, methods and material or judging whole system by the number of dying people in such country?

&gt;Nope. It's not the GMC's interpretation

I was quoting the exact information from the article, the same you've used to back up one of your arguments. I suggest you contact them and tell them what you've replied to me.

&gt;Bulgaria has particularly poor levels of care, but to take Bulgaria into consideration for a bar minimum in which Bulgaria would have to be included means that the UK and Poland will be disproportionately affected.

[Education index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Index) positions: Slovenia - 19, UK - 31, Bulgaria - 44, Romania - 52.... India - 147. To me, the point from this is clear, education levels in Europe are on very similar levels.

[GMC report comparing medical regulatory systems](http://www.gmc-uk.org/International_Comparison_of_Ten_Medical_Regulatory_Systems___final_report.pdf_25404378.pdf) - shows that GMC doesn't really know and control  much of non-EU medical systems either as otherwise they wouldn't be doing that report which also includes non-EU countries or did it many years ago, including all non-EU countries from which they get doctors.

What's also funny to note is the UK's university levels table, which I think is basically rubbish as it focuses on points like ""how many computers uni has, or what was student's satisfaction etc"". This is OK for rough idea but doesn't really reflect and gives actual comparison.

&gt;You admitted you weren't particularly informed on this subject. I merely told you that you weren't ans best to leave it alone until you were.

I think that gun possession should be limited even more, so when Farage says it wasn't necessary he again tries to find an unpopular opinion just to get votes from people who don't like certain changes. You have described something in more details but that didn't really give anything new into the topic. In fact, I had a discussion with someone on Reddit when he argued that having a ban after the Dunblane was also unnecessary as it was a singled out incident. So, when you just tried to defend Farage you again didn't do it well.

Should I go more? Anti smoking ban and what Farage had to say about it?

What about Farage's comment on Romanian people? Oh, you won't comment on it as it's not relevant or are you going to try to make a new story just to defend your great leader?

You know what's wrong with most UKIP-ers? I can, without any hesitation, tell you couple of things which Miliband and Clegg did, which were wrong moves or similar, even though I support them. UKIP-ers and you, as a good example, won't do it at your great leader and people's army... I mean party.

P.S. No wonder so many old people vote UKIP.

""Agents in the Ba’th Party headquarters in Baghdad had for years kept Washington au courant on the party’s personnel and organization, its secret communications and sources of funds, and its penetrations of military and civilian hierarchies in several countries....CIA sources were in a perfect position to follow each step of Ba’th preparations for the Iraqi coup, which focused on making contacts with military and civilian leaders in Baghdad. The CIA’s major source, in an ideal catbird seat, reported the exact time of the coup and provided a list of the new cabinet members....To call an upcoming coup requires the CIA to have sources within the group of plotters. Yet, from a diplomatic point of view, having secret contacts with plotters implies at least unofficial complicity in the plot.""

true,Chazmer87,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"In 2002, a resolution sponsored by the European Union was adopted by the Commission for Human Rights, which stated that there had been no improvement in the human rights crisis in Iraq. The statement condemned President Saddam Hussein's government for its ""systematic, widespread and extremely grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law"". The resolution demanded that Iraq immediately put an end to its ""summary and arbitrary executions... and the use of rape as a political tool and all enforced and involuntary disappearances"".


Full political participation at the national level was restricted only to members of the Ba'ath Party, which constituted only 8% of the population.


Iraqi citizens were not allowed to assemble legally unless it was to express support for the government. The Iraqi government controlled the establishment of political parties, regulated their internal affairs and monitored their activities.


Police checkpoints on Iraq's roads and highways prevented ordinary citizens from traveling across country without government permission and expensive exit visas prevented Iraqi citizens from traveling abroad. Before traveling, an Iraqi citizen had to post collateral. Iraqi females could not travel outside of the country without the escort of a male relative.


The activities of citizens living inside Iraq who received money from relatives abroad were closely monitored


Halabja poison gas attack:The Halabja poison gas attack occurred in the period 15–19 March 1988 during the Iran–Iraq War when chemical weapons were used by the Iraqi government forces and thousands of civilians in the Iraqi Kurdish town of Halabja were killed.


Al-Anfal Campaign: In 1988, the Hussein regime began a campaign of extermination against the Kurdish people living in Northern Iraq. This is known as the Anfal campaign. The campaign was mostly directed at Shiite Kurds (Faili Kurds) who sided with Iranians during the Iraq-Iran War. The attacks resulted in the death of at least 50,000 (some reports estimate as many as 182,000) people, many of them women and children. A team of Human Rights Watch investigators determined, after analyzing eighteen tons of captured Iraqi documents, testing soil samples and carrying out interviews with more than 350 witnesses, that the attacks on the Kurdish people were characterized by gross violations of human rights, including mass executions and disappearances of many tens of thousands of noncombatants, widespread use of chemical weapons including Sarin, mustard gas and nerve agents that killed thousands, the arbitrary imprisoning of tens of thousands of women, children, and elderly people for months in conditions of extreme deprivation, forced displacement of hundreds of thousands of villagers after the demolition of their homes, and the wholesale destruction of nearly two thousand villages along with their schools, mosques, farms and power stations.


In April 1991, after Saddam lost control of Kuwait in the Persian Gulf War, he cracked down ruthlessly against several uprisings in the Kurdish north and the Shia south. His forces committed full-scale massacres and other gross human rights violations against both groups similar to the violations mentioned before. Estimates of deaths during that time range from 20,000 to 100,000 for Kurds, and 60,000 to 130,000 for Shi'ites.


In June 1994, the Hussein regime in Iraq established severe penalties, including amputation, branding and the death penalty for criminal offenses such as theft, corruption, currency speculation and military desertion, while government members and Saddam's family members were immune from punishments ranging around these crimes.


On March 23, 2003, during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Iraqi television presented and interviewed prisoners of war on TV, violating the Geneva Convention.


Also in April 2003, CNN revealed that it had withheld information about Iraq torturing journalists and Iraqi citizens in the 1990s. According to CNN's chief news executive, the channel had been concerned for the safety not only of its own staff, but also of Iraqi sources and informants, who could expect punishment for speaking freely to reporters. Also according to the executive, ""other news organizations were in the same bind.""


After the 2003 invasion of Iraq, several mass graves were found in Iraq containing several thousand bodies total and more are being uncovered to this day. 


While most of the dead in the graves were believed to have died in the 1991 uprising against Saddam Hussein, some of them appeared to have died due to executions or died at times other than the 1991 rebellion.
Also after the invasion, numerous torture centers were found in security offices and police stations throughout Iraq. The equipment found at these centers typically included hooks for hanging people by the hands for beatings, devices for electric shock and other equipment often found in nations with harsh security services and other authoritarian nations.

Just some of the top of my head:

* Imperial War Museum - The London branch is currently being renovated and will be reopened on the 19th of July this year focused on WWI as it's the centenary of the beginning of the Great War, the IWM is one of the premier museums in the world dedicated to warfare.
* Churchill War Rooms - located between St James' Park and the River, the Churchill War Rooms is an underground bunker from where Prime Minister Winston Churchill ran the country during WWII 
*HMS Belfast - a cruiser moored in the Thames, HMS Belfast was in service during WWII - she took part in Arctic convoys protecting ships delivering supplies to Russia, and she missed out in firing the first shot on D-Day by 4 minutes. 
* Tower of London - obvious one
* British Museum - free, full of exhibits from Ancient Egypt, Greece, Rome etc right up to Victorian Britain (and maybe more recent stuff, I'm not sure)
* London Transport Museum - dedicated to the history of mass transport in London, from the first horse-drawn buses to the underground
* Natural History Museum - it's all in the name.
* Old Operating theatre, London Bridge - a museum of an auditorium where surgery was performed to train doctors - might not be suitable for your child, it depends on how mature they are.
* Household Cavalry Museum, Horseguards - a museum dedicated to the mounted bodyguard of the Sovereign
* Guards museum, as with the Household Cavalry museum, this museum is dedicated to the infantry regiments who guard the Sovereign - they are the soldiers you see in red tunics (or grey greatcoats) guarding Buckingham Palace and St James' Palace. The soldiers do serve in an operational capacity as well - they are not ""decorative"" or ""toy soldiers"" - they are some of our nation's finest and bravest servicemen whose duties include an active defence of the monarch - their weapons are loaded and they are authorised to use them if they have to in defence of the buildings they guard or people in them.
* Sherlock Holmes Museum, Baker Street - not in 221b (which doesn't exist)!
* Bank of England museum - dedicated to the history of currency in this country - free entry
* Whitechapel Bell museum - doubly famous as the oldest company in Britain to have been in continuous operation (founded in 1570) and to have cast Big Ben - the bell that hangs in the Elizabeth Tower at the Houses of Parliament - be advised this museum must be pre-booked
* Westminster Abbey Museum - housed in the undercroft, this museum, besides being in one of the best churches in the world, is dedicated to the history of the space and to some of the people who are buried there.
* Clockmaker's museum, moorgate - as the name suggests, it's a museum dedicated to the process of making clocks and timepieces. 
* London Docklands museum - dedicated to the history of ships docking in London, from Roman times via Viking invasions and the East India Company to the role of the docks in supplying factories in WWII - free entry
* RAF Museum - dedicated to the Royal Air Force since it's inception in 1918.

For culture, there's the tate modern, the Victoria &amp; Albert museum (this one rotates it's displays so check what they're showing before you go), and plenty of smaller museums relating to specific aspects, like the ragged school museum, dedicated to the schools formed to teach deprived children in the Victorian period.

The principal of compound interest shows how money growing in your pension pot has the biggest effect on the total fund.  But tens of millions of working-age people have achieved no or negative growth in their pension.  This is going to cause a *huge* problem, one that will get worse over the next twenty, thirty or forty years.

You could argue that given the financial crisis low rates were inevitable.  And this is largely true.  However there's been a much larger trend over the past thirty years towards lower rates; assuming that lower = better in all circumstances.  But it really isn't.

Classic economics has it that interest rates can be tweaked to modify the value of money.  The value of a high-interest currency is higher than a low one - because foreign investors will deposit with your banks, etc., there's a net influx of capital that raises the value of your currency.  But high-value currency isn't what you want, you only want to control inflation.

Combined with this is the fact that lowering rates has an investment boost, companies borrow to expand; people borrow to buy a new house etc.  So lowering rates increases investment natively, but runs the risk of higher inflation.

What the policy makers and economists have missed however, is that higher-borrowing has a dragging effect on the economy; due to incomes being eaten by debt-repayments.  So you can lower rates indefinitely without increasing inflation if, and only if: you do it slowly enough, and everyone else is doing the same thing.  And this is exactly what's happened.  Low rates and low inflation, but also low growth.

But still people are banging on about stimulus.  This is the inevitable end of thirty years of short-term mismanagement.

There's no way out without upsetting a lot of people.  The only sane approach is to ignore the effect of rates on asset prices, and only consider it's effect on growth and investment.  Although crashing asset prices would affect these two.

This question comes across as some sort of insult, as though Geography determines the ability for someone to take an interest in something, learn about it and comment on it. To answer your question, no I'm not, I'm British, so if Geography is a factor I at least know a bit about imperialism.

&gt; Rwanda was/is under the domain of the French so if you want to blame anyone look towards France.

There are many things you can blame France for, but the Rwandan Genocide? Surely that's a product of Belgium's artificial distinction between Hutus and Tutsis, carried forward post-independence by politicians on all sides and by the Interhamwe as justification for the Genocide.

&gt; The slaughter in the Balkans (Slovenia/Croatia/Bosnia/KosovA) ? Europe sat idlely by and did nothing where the murdering was literally next doors.

Well, to be fair the Balkans has seen massive amounts of slaughter directly by Europe (there's some fantastic history about the fighting between Imperial Russia, the Ottoman Empire and the Austro-Hungarians if that sort of thing is of interest), but I'll assume you're referring to the post-Yugoslav conflict of the 90s?

Since the deposit is protected all tenants and the landlord/agent have to reach agreement on what will happen to the deposit, the agent can't just act unilaterally. If you can't reach agreement the schemes offer a dispute resolution service which is intended to avoid court action.

For EEA state citizens (not EU!) regulations are laid out in [the eligiblity regulations](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/1294/contents/made). A very fun, easy to read and interpret piece of legislation!

/s

Applicants are not eligible for housing assistance if their right to remain in the UK is derived from their right to look for work as a Job Seeker or the family member of a Job Seeker. If they're a worker and not subject to immigration control then they're eligible for assistance, moreover if they work continually for 12 months then they're eligible for assistance for a further 6 months as a Job Seeker. This gets more complex when you throw in things like children in eduction, students but it's a Friday night and I'm drinking heavily and already talking about housing law on Reddit....

Asylum seekers don't count as they're almost certainly subject to immigration control, people with refugee status do count. Everyone else is subject to a habitual residency test so if you're coming from like, Australia, you have to prove that you have a decent reason to be here. There's no definition of habitual residency so you just have to prove to the housing person you intend to stay here e.g. you're registered with a GP, have no house in Oz, closed all bank accounts there and moved them here. You can be a British Citizen, not habitually resident and not be eligible for housing. Most common one we come across is people who sell up and move to Spain, don't like it or it goes tits up and want to come back - They're not eligible.

In the instance you describe above, the duty to assist ineligible families lies with social services and not the housing dept. and falls under the care of foreign nationals in an act I cannot remember the name of! So not only do they not get priority, they get no assistance at all.

The above is for assistance under the housing act 1996 and the housing act 2002, the criteria for acceptance onto a local authority housing register is almost certainly stricter than the above.

So rather than attacking each other as arseholes, how about you say that you shouldn't have said 'Bullshit', and that I should clarify more?

I'd still argue that before you did call 'bullshit', you'd have caught a lot more with honey rather than sour, and certainly if you'd not said it to someone that, "" clearly knew very well, while I did NOT know about""

You're actually arguing that I knew more about something than you did, and then somehow excusing that for calling out 'bullshit'.

You didn't know 'well about'.  Hold back on the 'bullshit' allegations.

You did actually use them in the context of quality.  Maybe go back and re-read the comments...?

&gt;You say to yourself that you can and I disagree, simple as that. I was referring to GMC and HPC in order to tell you that somehow EU doesn't force everybody to automatically recognise everything that is European, as otherwise they would be doing so with everything else. In fact, there is UCAS which finds UK's equivalents of non-UK education levels.

Pllleaaaasee don't tell me that you're basing this on UCAS entry levels.
  It means nothing.

That isn't remotely a gauge of education or teaching beyond school kids.  That's a stepping stone.


&gt;I am still not convinced that GMC was one day told by the EU, that ""you need to recognise medical qualifications because we just say so"".

You don't need to be convinced, but that's exactly what happened in 2005 with the Health Care Act.

It's why the GMC were in consultation with the EU in 2013.

&gt;Education index positions: Slovenia - 19, UK - 31, Bulgaria - 44, Romania - 52.... India - 147. To me, the point from this is clear, education levels in Europe are on very similar levels.

You just showed how there is differences.

How the UK could hire from the best without having to adopt the worst. Or why there is a need to cream off the top, if we can.

You just went from not wanting to acknowledge a difference to arguing that there was one.

&gt;I think that gun possession should be limited even more, so when Farage says it wasn't necessary he again tries to find an unpopular opinion just to get votes from people who don't like certain changes.

Of the developed Western world we have the second strictest gun laws behind Japan.   That was before the Blair additions.

&gt; In fact, I had a discussion with someone on Reddit when he argued that having a ban after the Dunblane was also unnecessary as it was a singled out incident. So, when you just tried to defend Farage you again didn't do it well.

That's non-sensical, and it refers to the John Major ban not the Blair ban.

&gt;What about Farage's comment on Romanian people? Oh, you won't comment on it as it's not relevant or are you going to try to make a new story just to defend your great leader?

Romanian people are great.  

Their economy and their situation?  Not so much.

Highish standards mashing together with lowish expectations doesn't work so well.

&gt;You know what's wrong with most UKIP-ers? 

All ears...

         I can, without any hesitation, tell you couple of things 
         which Miliband and Clegg did, which were wrong moves 
         or similar, even though I support them. UKIP-ers and you,
         as a good example, won't do it at your great leader and
         people's army... I mean party.

That, which I cited, was the rest of the paragraph.  It doesn't make any sense. 

You say without hesitation you can tell me something and then it's just glumbergarackdfjbgnmg.",0,1402697574,null,0,1402697813,0,ci6xxzi,t3_27m2id,t1_ci6xxzi,t1_ci6t0qs,null,1434228385,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Then his wife said something about him going on 'his usual run'.  I suspect this - he was a big fat bloke, so he decided to lose weight by running.  Man in his 50's weighs 18 stone and starts to go running three times a week plus he's got a serious medical condition from his quad bike accident several years ago.  Risky?  You fucking bet.

You are making judgement based off 60 minutes of play by Costa (where he might not have been 100% fit) and 12 minutes of play by Fabergas in a team that plays a completely different style than Chelsea do, yet I'm the one caught up in my emotions.

I'm not saying these players are going to set the world alight at Chelsea. Hell, I'm not even saying that they wont fail.

What I'm saying is that we have almost no evidence to make any solid assumptions from. So acting like they have already failed is just as dumb as acting like they have already succeeded.

**tl;dr - you're fine** 

----------------------------

* Consider your stream to be ***x*** kbps

* Converting to kilobytes (divide by 8 or 2^3 ) we get ***x/2^3*** kBps

* Divide by 1024 (2^10 ) to get this in MBps: ***x/2^13*** MBps

* You have ***y*** amount of data so to find out how many seconds you can divide 500 by the above result: ***y/(x/2^13 ) = (2^13 · y)/x***

* To convert this to minutes of music : ***(2^13 · y)/(60x)***

* Simplifying some of those numbers: ***136.5y/x*** . 

* If you want to convert to hours of music: ***t = 2.28y/x*** (where ***t*** is the amount of hours you can use

---------------------------

* In your case we know:
 * ***y*** = 500
 * ***t*** = 4
 * ***x*** = whatever bitrate your stream is.

Instead I will try something different and work out the best bitrate you can listen to which will use all your data (I don't recommend this because you will have background data use)

***4 = 2.28·500/x***

***x = 2.28·500/4 = 285 kbps***

Thus meaning **285 kbps** is the best bitrate you can get away with.

--------------------------------------

Perhaps instead you know that your stream is at **192kbps**

***t = 2.28·500/192 = 5.94*** so you'd get almost six hours at this rate.",0,1402698627,null,0,false,0,ci6ydzu,t3_282o1q,t1_ci6ydzu,t3_282o1q,null,1434228595,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3

The metric system isn't going away, and more familiarity with it isn't a bad thing.

Teaching imperial units wastes a lot of time with pointless rote memorisation, such as memorising that there are 1760 yards in a mile, which is the same as 5280 feet or 63360 inches.

This isn't the kind of mathematics education we need &amp;ndash; real maths is about problem solving, not memorising tables of unit conversions so you know how many square poles are in an acre.

- Madame Tussauds - two millennia of history and you pay to look at a wax model of Rihanna?
- [Angus Steak House](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/angus-steakhouse-how-does-tourist-staple-continue-to-thrive-in-todays-gourmet-market-9268063.html)
- guided tour buses - I've often seen people say why bother as you can cover the same ground on TfL buses for cheaper, though personally I can well understand why the open top + audio commentary would appeal to people
- Taking the tube short distances within zone 1 when you could have a fairly short and pleasant walk seeing more things along the way - remember the tube map is very ungeographic, get [citymapper](https://citymapper.com/) on your smartphone and use that for a breakdown of all transport options including walk/bike
- Buckingham Palace :P  I've never known anyone care about visiting, but I guess that's just my generation's / demographic's studied apathy to the royalty
- London Dungeon and some other similar attractions in the area are widely seen as tourist traps, [see this list](http://www.frommers.com/slideshows/847904-london-s-8-biggest-tourist-traps#slide847997).  (Regarding the prime meridian in that list, if you _just_ want the instagram moment then it's a rip off, but it _is_ worth paying to see the Royal Observatory if you're interested in science and history and go round it all, imo)
- London Eye and View from the Shard - some people think they're overpriced and advise going to one of the many high-level bars or restuarants in the Shard, Heron Tower etc as then you pay to eat + drink and the view comes free.  That said, personally I'd rather concentrate on gawping than dining, and since you can stay as long as you like I didn't feel hard-done-by at the Shard's (admittedly expensive) ticket.
- Brick Lane - I still think it's a cool place to stroll along for the atmosphere, personally, but in gourmet terms you can get a better curry without really trying, literally anywhere in London or indeed the UK.  (as you're interested in local food, btw, DO seek out a quality ""indian""(pakistani/bengali/nepali/bangladeshi))
- Piccadilly Circus, Leicester Square - ok, this might just be me, but I don't really 'get' these places. Piccadilly Circus has a few LED adverts like a really really shit Times Square and an average statue like you see all over London.  Leicester Square is mostly ugly, has some cinemas (big wow), an unspectacular Chinatown in a country where Chinese restuarants are ubiquitous anyway, musicals based on the songs of Abba and generic overpriced bars, I just don't get it


Things locals almost universally agree are pretty damn awesome, not least because they're free:

- the major museums and galleries (British, National History, Science, V&amp;A, Tate Modern, etc)

- the South Bank

The vast majority of non-EEA immigrants come on Tier 2 (standard sponsored work permit) or Tier 4 (sponsored student). Both of these groups have 'no recourse to public funds' stamped right on their Limited Leave to Remain. 

[Here's the relevant policy](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/1294/regulation/3/made):

&gt; Class A – a person who is recorded by the Secretary of State as a refugee within the definition in Article 1 of the Refugee Convention and who has leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom;

So refugees can apply for social housing.

&gt; Class B – a person—

&gt; (i)who has exceptional leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom granted outside the provisions of the Immigration Rules; **and**

&gt; (ii)**who is not subject to a condition requiring him to maintain and accommodate himself, and any person who is dependent on him, without recourse to public funds;** [my emphasis added]

This one is a bit tricky but would mainly refer to stateless people and other non-refugees seeking protection under international treaty **and** who has ostensibly applied outside the Points-Based System.

&gt; Class C – a person who is habitually resident in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man or the Republic of Ireland and **whose leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom is not subject to any limitation or condition**, other than a person—

So people with permanent residency (Indefinite Leave to Remain) or Right of Abode

&gt; (i)who has been given leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom upon an undertaking given by his sponsor;

Mainly young and elderly dependants of family members who function as their primary carers.

&gt; (ii)who has been resident in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man or the Republic of Ireland for less than five years beginning on the date of entry or the date on which his sponsor gave the undertaking in respect of him, whichever date is the later; and

Referring to those people being cared for by relatives

&gt; (iii)whose sponsor or, where there is more than one sponsor, at least one of whose sponsors, is still alive; and

So those people in care still have a living sponsor; if their sponsor has died, they go through a different system

&gt; (d)Class D – a person who left the territory of Montserrat after 1st November 1995 because of the effect on that territory of a volcanic eruption.

As it says on the tin - mainly people who were British Dependent Territory citizens of Montserrat in 1995. 

[Section 4: **PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE THE EEA *NOT* ELIGIBLE**](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/1294/regulation/4/made)

This basically describes people who aren't considered resident in the UK and certain family members of EEA citizens exercising job seeker status.

Paragraph 2 states that people who are EEA citizens in the following categories are excepted, and can qualify for housing assistance.

Therefore, my suspicion is that the LSE analyst either misread 2(a) of Section 4 and figured that those residence statuses (worker, self-employed) applied to *all* immigrants, and not just EEA ones, or misread the 'sponsor' section as being *all* landed immigrant categories requiring sponsorship, including the Points-Based System tiers, whereas it only applies to dependants sponsored by living relatives settled in the UK *outside* the Points-Based System.

As a result, the contention that at least 90% of immigrants would qualify seems to be seriously miscalculated to me, as every immigrant under the points based system, *by definition*, does not meet the eligibility for social housing ([which is considered a public fund](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-funds--2/public-funds)) as those are financially self-sufficient visas.

There is also [Section 5](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/1294/regulation/5/made), that mainly restates what's written in Sections 3 and 4, and adds in a paragraph on asylum seekers. Any immigration solicitors here who can shed some light on their numbers? Because from where I sit, they don't add up.

**EDIT** - I think that to get an even closely accurate number of how many immigrants are eligible for public funds, you would have to establish the percentage of total migrants that are currently in the UK under the Points-Based System. I can find no numbers anywhere, but imagine a simple Freedom of Information request to the Home Office would probably yield the numbers desired. The closest I can find is [this report from Labour Migration Watch](http://www.labmiggov.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/UK-case-study-FINAL.pdf):

&gt; There are no pre-defined performance indicators for the PBS. In terms of realising the vision of economically useful immigration, first emphatically promoted by the Labour government of Tony Blair in the late 1990s, we can say that effectively, *there has been a rise in the proportion of skilled workers and students* [emphasis added]. The number of work
permits and first permissions issued between 1995 and 2005 more than tripled. Work related migration grew from 18.2 per cent in 1995 to 24.7 per cent in 2004 (Somerville 2007). Of course, it is hard to determine the relative influence of labour migration policy reform and strong economic growth levels during this period. *Over recent years, the largest proportion of non-EEA inflows enter the UK through the study route (MAC 2010).* [emphasis added]

The 'study route' in question would be the sponsored Tier 4 visa and its 'student visa' predecessor, which had no access to public funds, nor do the work-related Tier 1 and 2 groups and their 'work permit' predecessors. Also, when they say, ""Work related migration grew from 18.2 per cent in 1995 to 24.7 per cent in 2004,"" this would be at the expense of other types of migration - primarily family (spouse or family reunification) or refugee/asylum.",0,1402707506,null,0,1402709881,0,ci71qnh,t3_281xxd,t1_ci71qnh,t1_ci6sj5m,null,1434230241,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I found this, which basically says there must be a qualified driver in the car. While you could feasibly have a monkey or no driver at all for a run, it would not be valid according to the rules.

&gt;D6.3.6 Drivers. For each Driver (official and reserve): first 
name, surname, type, number and date of the Licence, and the 
name of the ASN having delivered it, (and letter of authorisation, 
in the case of a foreigner).

I couldn't find anything about driver aids for the Absolute Land Speed Record that Bloodhound will be going for, but it seems pretty sensible to allow drivers aids when the car is travelling so quickly. At the end of the day, Andy Green is still operating the car, he is just being given a helping hand by the computer to get the best out of the equipment. Also, it is important for him to actually drive it for the testing. How can he know how the car will handle at different speeds if he only has simulator work to go on? The drivers input is also hugely important to the engineers. The various sensors can tell them a lot, but even if everything looks perfect from there, there could be other factors that could mean the driver has less confidence in the car than can be told by the sensors information.

As for reflexes, Andy Green is currently a Wing Commander in the RAF and flew Tornado's at the time of setting the current record in Thrust SSC.

It's very difficult without an incredibly long explanation to get across how important the ECHR is to our domestic law. It was written by British lawyers, supported by Winston Churchill and designed to enforce British human rights principles across Europe. A lot of the major changes in the rights of British citizens have been made in the context of the ECHR - in other words the ECHR exists in place of developments in UK law and to suggest that repealing it because 21st century UK law will do fine instead is to fundamentally misunderstand the effect the ECHR has had. 21st century law is only broadly sufficient in protecting the rights of UK people because the ECHR has lead us to the position we are now. 

It's also apparently lost on many people what the Human Rights Act is. It does not introduce any new human rights laws...at all. The HRA is a 'domestification' of European human rights law allowing British judges to inject their own interpretation into human rights law. In some ways it's a limitation on the ECHR because it allows British judges to decide cases on human rights and prevent cases from reaching the court in Strasbourg.

If the HRA is repealed not only will be still be in the ECHR but now British judges will be unable to decide human rights cases and every related case will be forced to go to the time and HUGE expense of going to Strasbourg. If you don't like European Human Rights law then you should be fighting to keep the HRA but fighting to leave the ECHR which is the document that actually matters.

The only reason they would ever want to repeal the ECHR is if they want to weaken the entire system for everyone. 

**EDIT:** Not that repealing the HRA will repeal the ECHR. It will merely inconvenience British citizens who want to hold the government to account by forcing them to take their cases to Strasbourg and disallow UK judges from passing judgment on human rights issues. They may want to do this because:

1.) It's embarrassing when UK judges contradict the government. By forcing UK citizens to go to Strasbourg will allow UK politicians to blame everything of some other institution deflecting criticism from them to some foreign institution. They've done the same with the EU for decades. The Conservatives tend to automatically become hostile to anyone telling them what they should do even if it is sensible, intelligent and in line with British values. Doesn't matter what it is if it's not directly their idea they thoughtlessly reject it out of hand.

2.) They want to discourage people from raising human rights complaints because of the huge cost of taking your case to the Strasbourg courts. It has the effect of massively increasing the court costs for anyone who wants to accuse the government of breaching their human rights which has obvious benefits for a government that is quite keen on getting away with human rights violations.

the only real advice I can offer is retrospective. 
 
* install some software like [prey](https://preyproject.com/) on laptops and phones (before it's too late).

* hide or remove portable valuables when you go out

You could also try kicking up a *real* fuss. First with your landlord and then with either the service company or if he's self employed, directly with the service guy. Name and shame !

edit: specifically, try this.

call the service company. get to speak to the *owner*. tell them that your laptop was stolen from your house whilst you were away and that the service guy was the only person to have access to the house during that time. if you get the laptop back you'll forget about the whole thing and get on with your life. if you don't get it back, you're going to take them to the small claims court (it's easy, everyone should learn how to do it), you'll blog and twitter about it (doesn't matter if you don't have a blog or twitter. mention /r/unitedkingdom 77,000 subscribers) and generally cause them *way more* than a laptops worth of bad publicity. be nice, polite but firm.

They'll sweat the laptop of the service guy (or they might just buy you a new one to shut you up)

Offensively, he couldn't get forward often because there was no right winger to overlap/divert attention, Silva was everywhere but on the right. Very often he would get the ball down the right and the entire team would be shifted towards the left which left him with no option but to pass it backwards, he didn't get a single cross in because of this.

Defensively, he had no one helping out with their wing backs. I don't know if Del Bosque trusted him enough or if it was just poor tactics but most of the times he was doing it all by himself. He made a one mistake all game and that was during the set piece when he lost his man and they scored. Some are saying he should have got tighter to Blind for the second goal but he did the right thing, you don't over commit in that situation. Not to mention he had a midfielder to watch out for as well. Not his fault Pique and Ramos couldn't deal with a simple ball over the top.

The illegality of cannabis is not arbitrary - there were very good reasons for banning it in 1925 which are as valid and important today as they were then. Its recreational use destroys the lives of many who use it and the lives of those who love them, is strongly correlated with mental illness and violent crime and it's legality would would only accelerate our movement towards a hedonistic, Huxleyan dystopia in which the attainment of pleasure exceeds all other pursuits. This was the society observed in Egypt in the early twentieth century which was the main motivation for keeping cannabis out of the League of Nations member states.

As such, students have to do an extra exam, the *Selectividad*, if they want to go to university. However, some regions have a reputation for having an easier *Selectividad* than others (I have no idea if this is true or not), so some people might organise to do theirs based on that rather than in their hometown.

They do have good things.

The transfers for Bayern depend a lot on Pep plans, is he planing with a 3 man defense line is the biggest question right now, but even if Guardiola will continue playing a 4 man back line, the CB spot is seen as the only position where Bayern could buy a top player (excluding Lewandowski). 
If Bayern sells Shaqiri, I would bet they will only go for a different talent to replace him.

The police moved him on after they decided he'd done two things wrong:

* fail to comply with a dispersal order under s27 of the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006. According to the [act itself](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/38/section/27), orders can only be given if ""the presence of the individual in that locality is likely, in all the circumstances, to cause or to contribute to the occurrence of **alcohol-related crime** or disorder in that locality, or to cause or to contribute to a repetition or continuance there of such crime or disorder"". That's an over-broad and fairly oppressive piece of legislation typical of the sort created by the last Labour government. However, it doesn't cover this incident.

* the article also says that he was arrested for ""racial harrassment"". I assume from this that they arrested him under the racially or religiously aggravated form of the offence found in s5 of the Public Order Act 1986. You can read the Crown Prosecution Service's guidance on that act [here](http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/p_to_r/public_order_offences/#Section_5), and read section 5 itself [here](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/64). This also is a fairly broad piece of legislation (although it used until recently to be even broader), and a firm favourite of police officers wishing to deal with smart mouthed members of the public (my sister has a conviction under it after talking back to a cop). Reading that piece of legislation, I don't see how the guy in question was guilty of it - nothing he said seemed ""abusive"" to me.

I think what this illustrates is the wisdom of US jurists in the past century. They recognized that even if you have laws that, on a strict reading, do in fact protect people engaging in good faith public debate, those laws can be abused and creatively interpreted to shut down public debate. So it's better to have laws which could circumscribe people's free speech very carefully controlled indeed.

I signed it because the friends and relatives of the victims do deserve justice. 

Why does this debate seem to get people's backs up when most right-minded individuals feel nothing but sympathy for the victims and their loved ones? Why do people invoke the 'pity-city' moniker? Perhaps, for example, it's the glut of twitter users whose name contains a variant of 'jft96', screaming about how Howard Webb should be raped in prison or some such ill-judged vulgarity.

There's a whole lot of noise around this issue. A great deal of it is not born of actual outrage but of tribal affiliation. Liverpool is a big city and LFC have a huge support base. The majority in these groups have no personal connection to a Hillsborough victim but everyone has to walk on eggshells around them? Mock outrage does the victims no service.

I'll give you some considered advice for this, because I know so many people who've come to the UK, done fish &amp; chips wrong, and come away wondering why people think it's anything great to eat.

Every pub you pass in central London will have a board outside saying ""Best fish &amp; chips in London!"". Every single one is lying. Really. Every one of them. You can't get decent fish &amp; chips in any pub anywhere in London (and only in a few outside of London, usually those by the port in fishing towns).

Proper fish &amp; chips doesn't come from sitting down at a table in a pub, or a restaurant, it comes as a takeaway from a fish &amp; chip shop.
