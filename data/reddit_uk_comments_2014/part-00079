&gt;  Frankly I commend your school for dealing with it proper and I feel sorry for the teacher who not only lost a student but then has also had to deal with bullying from students about it. How would you like someone to basically say that it's your fault someone committed suicide?

Sorry, I could have been clearer on the issue but this is *not* the case at all. I have never said that I thought it was the teacher's fault my friend took her life. There was a lack of communication between the mental health establishments, the home she was sectioned in for a year, the school, and within the school. There were many incidents in the school with different members of staff there they were misinformed on how to treat/deal with her (she had severe schizophrenia, psychosis and manic depression), and most of them included the member of staff that was mentioned in the initial conversation. The reason we were talking about her is because she is the head of the pastoral support of the school.

1. Utd progress to the next round. This is Moyes' saving grace. A Champions League quarter final is a good enough showing as Utd limp to the summer. They crash out to Bayern/Real/Barca as expected, but its just impetus to give Moyes some cash to squander during the summer. He has a poor record with big money buys (e.g. Diniyar Bilyaletdinov, Andy Johnson), and that Ed Woodward bloke seemed pretty hamfisted in the transfer market too. ***Result*** - This is the darkest timeline!

Utd end up in a far worse spot, with overpaid players and Giggs managing the team (a la Tim Sherwood). Old Trafford is demolished and replaced with laser tag.

So its okay to be pleased that Moyes job is safe. Sun Tzu says that you must completely crush your enemies. For me, keeping Moyes at the helm is the road to destruction for Utd.

In my case I went for my prescription one week, was told my GP refused to give me it and that I'd have to see them. So I saw them, and she still refused to give me the prescription, telling me I'd have to see a specialist gynaeologist. So cue two months of titting around, before I got my prescription back. Then again a few months later, I was taken back off it by the same doctor, who told me I didn't need it. Then after seeing a different doctor, I got the prescription restored again and I thought that might have been the end of it.

  Skip forward to roughly a year ago and my doctor said that because the drug was only licenced for diabetes, I'd have to go to the consultant at the hospital again. So I went, only to be given the same prescription as before, with the added annoyance that I went through three blood tests, two ultrasound scans and a whole shedload of other tests just to be told what I already knew. 

  If it happens again, I'm going to refuse any more scans or tests unless they can justify them, because I'm not wasting any more time on tests that aren't helping me one bit. My GP now has TWO lots of letters from my consultant telling me I need metformin treatment, so if that isn't good enough I don't know what is.

I really don't believe the Homer Simpson doppelganger caricature Moyes' been turned into. It may be in the past, but the man got Everton finishing above us the last two seasons while breaking even financially - a prospect that might've had both Liverpool regimes salivating. His football may not have been Rodgersesque, but let's be honest - who's has? And his Everton certainly weren't as incoherent as the lack of confidence makes the current United side seem. Maybe it's the subconscious but inevitable comparisons people make to his skillfully overperforming counterparts like Mourinho (wistfully) and Rodgers (grudgingly), that makes him insipid in comparison. What's made clear through all of this however, is Ferguson's prioritization in his assessment of the manager's job - with a definitive style or culture of the club's football taking a backseat to financial management, etc.

Imagine how another manager might have handled Gerrard, play him behind striker only on his reputation, if he has guts maybe move him to cm, but doubtful he would try him at holding role after having 2 crappy games there. Even cm position took time to get used to. Then there is the Suarez situation, another manager might have been too friendly with players to go against them, but Rodgers acted in the interest of the club. He was ready to overhaul the squad, willing to sell Agger, Skrtel, Henderson, Carroll etc. if it meant improvement. Lastly, Rodgers learns from his mistakes fast, does 2 man midfield against AV, fixes it after first half, look at Moyes against us. 

He has had a lot of time, yet his team aren't heading anywhere, are they possession based, counter attack based, are they good at grinding results, mentality and training too. He hasn't shown any quality that would warrant having him around, except for Uniteds pride and specially SAF, he was the one who hired him, he will want him to succeed. So 10 decent games and I'm sure everyone will get off his back. Or we could complain and hope that he fails miserably this season only for them to get a very competent and experienced CL manager (which even we don't have).

The Beeb decided to ultimately change the show so that instead of being ""the children's show that adults adore"", it became a children's show aimed at younger children only. So people that were really young when it was on thought it was great - anyone older usually had a different opinion (most of whom were still complaining that they hadn't found another Tom Baker).

None of this was McCoy's fault, though, and when he popped up again in the intro to the TV Movie in 1996, I felt sad that he could have been so much more if the show had been produced more in the old style.

And to be honest I thought that was quite funny, not to mention it's getting noticed, which is the whole point. They're not stupid, they know if they word it just right some angry fucker will post it all over Reddit and get people talking about it. 

I'm not a huge fan of politics, I find most of it a waste of time. But I do know that my taxes over the last couple of years have dropped. This is a good thing for me, but no doubt one of you cynical fuckers will find some reason to complain about it. How dare those posh, patronising cunts raise our tax free threshold by a thousand pounds a year! They're just hanging us out to dry and raking it all in! 

The simple fact is that nothing the government does will ever make everyone happy. They have an immensely difficult job in trying to maintain our economy and the services the state provides on the finite amount of money available to them. If they raise taxes they can afford to give us more, but we'd complain because we're out of pocket. If they cut services or lower taxes we'd complain because they're taking things away. 

This government provides free health care and education to every single UK citizen. It supports the unemployed while they look for work, polices our streets, takes care of you when you're sick and teaches you to read and write. Despite the flaws that are bound to be present, that is a huge achievement for any country and any government. And they do all of this while putting up with all your whining.

And let's not forget they also have to try and keep Putin from starting WW3. Do you want that job? I fucking don't. 

I won't shame the government for trying to win votes, it's what all political parties do, upper class or not. Unfortunately, it's what comes with being a democracy. And they've been clever, no one likes paying duty, so they've done what any one of you would do in the same situation and used it to win people over. It's an intentional slap in the face to get attention, and it's worked.

In the reboot series, the latter describes Amy, Rory, Clara, Rose, and Martha to different degrees, while the former really applies to Donna. And River, I suppose, but not as much. 

Myself, I enjoyed the change of pace. I like how hard it was for the Doctor, or anyone really, to change her mind or tell her what to do. It's fun watching the Doctor have to fight for control of the steering wheel when the companions are usually relegated to mere passengers on the Doctor's journey.

And really, if he does sign on for a job in England, it'll likely be his last. We might complain about squad injuries and all, but there's still depth thanks to our midfield horde. 

Summer is going to be absolute chaos for Manchester United.

Contrast this to our situation; plenty of depth in most positions but a few (left winger and left back, mainly, but I'd like to see Caulker back. In any case, it'll be Baldini and a ""committee"" doing the transfers, so LvG will have everything ready for him once he gets back from Brazil.), up and coming youth, etc.

So there is no reason giving the creation of money to a public and independent body would increase inflation. Also a public body may decide to spend the money on things that actually decrease overall price levels (like some infrastructure projects which mean transporting goods becomes cheaper).

I'll expand on this:

Aspas - He was a bit of a punt on BR's part and I just think he has failed to shine. We could definitely find a better option with CL on the way. Seems like a great guy, though.

Alberto I think is a smart player but he just doesn't seem like he's a PL player. I think he could have a much better career in La Liga. I just don't ever see a scenario where we are kicking ourselves in 3 years time if we let him leave. He could be above average at best.

Assaidi - I'm actually really proud of the things I have seen him do for Stoke, but let's be honest we can, like Aspas, attract better options in his position with the CL lure. I also think we can make a tidy profit on him this summer. Sell while the stock is high in case it was a flash in the pan season. Not that he has lit the world on fire.

Moses - Right then.

Kolo - Hard to swallow, but he cost us what? Two clear-cut points this season with errors? Or is it more? If he's really that great in the dressing room, I guess hold on to him.

Borini - Maybe keep him if he is content to almost never start.

Education hasn't been cut significantly either, and the education reforms have cut managers and allowed parents to have more choice to use newly legalised competition to demand a better service.

These tax cuts might be popular, but why is that a bad thing? Furthermore, they aren't significant enough to have any noticeable impact on health care or education spending, whereas they do have an impact on working people's quality of life and spending power, which should be an absolute priority at this time.

He seems to have gelled well off the field with some of the other players (he's always in the social pics that get posted). The only obstacle could be psychological. His confidence is bound to be low due to his lack of playing time and the lack of impact he's made when he's had 20 minutes or more on the pitch.

  It seems so clear to me that he desperately wants to do well for the team when he plays, and I admire his selflessness in sitting on the bench without any complaints. 

  Next season, we'll need more depth and he'll no doubt get more game time if he stays. It must be frustrating for him. He's maybe too good (from what I've seen of him) and too far along in his career to be a bench warmer, but possibly not quite good enough to offer a viable rotation solution to Danny or Luis. The fact that he's played so little is only going to exacerbate that. 

  So, that garbled mess of text aside, I think he *is* good enough in simple footballing terms. I think his attitude is commendable.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"The seventh Doctor is my favorite. I told myself when I started watching classic who that I wouldn't pick a favorite. I wanted to love all the Doctors. And I do. But the seventh has stolen my heart.

He's dark, mysterious, mercurial but knows how to put a smile on your face. He's the perfect incarnation to have little vignette stories about people meeting an eccentric man. Seven has a dark Time Lord power; he says himself that he is ""far more than just another Time Lord"". While the seventh seems like a goofy dusty professor on the outside, sometimes you can tell there's an undercurrent of something. Something alien, terrifying, and lethal. (And it's different from Matt Smith's comedy act because we laugh *at* 11 and his joking. He's not actually a dusty professor like the Professor is.)

But it's different from the godlike awe of the tenth Doctor. The tenth Doctor's godlike attitude always comes with that arrogant ""moraller""/holier-than-thou undertone and his portrayal of ""dark"" makes you think that he is some kind of tragic and lonely god high above us who lives in another plane. But the seventh Doctor's ""dark"" feels more like a pervasive sense of deeply foreboding mystery. (That and as I mentioned before, Tennant can't do ""eccentric"" very well despite being a master at barely-concealed-anger. McCoy has the opposite acting strength/weakness.)

Seven's dark foreboding power is emphasized in the novel Lungbarrow. I mean, he *is* revealed to be the Other in the novel. And even his cousins in the House of Lungbarrow often wonder what the Doctor is. Despite being only the seventh incarnation, he feels ancient to me. Older than the others, with a mysterious and unknown legacy stretching so far back into history.

Remembrance of the Daleks was my first seventh Doctor story. I think. And I immediately liked 7. His personality is a blend of dignity and humility, comedy and darkness.

Plus his kickass companion Ace. They have a great dynamic. It's a tag-team ""you do the talking, I do the walking"", with 7 as a sort of stand-in parent/guide and tutor. But often horrifyingly manipulative (Love and War, Curse of Fenric). Seven has a reputation as the great manipulator for a reason and often what he does, he does for the “greater good”. He forgets to look at humans, the smaller picture. This is the complete opposite of 10.

His run on Big Finish Productions' audio drama range as only made me love him more. McCoy's stories have made me cry. Yup. And break my heart. And just recently I listened to what is, imo, the best radio drama* I've heard yet out of 200+ and it's with SEVEN.",0,1395294239,null,0,false,0,cg7735k,t3_20tnb3,t1_cg7735k,t3_20tnb3,null,1432986874,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

&gt; The nationalist community was, in the eyes of the UVF, culpable.
&gt; 
&gt; The UVF has never sought to hide the fact that its campaign was aimed at subjecting the nationalist community to a level of violence that would instil fear and terror in members of that community.
&gt; 
&gt; The objective was simple – subject the nationalist community to an oppressive force of violence as retribution for republican violence.
&gt; 
&gt; the UVF made no pretences that its bombing campaign was against military and economic targets.
&gt; 
&gt; The UVF has publicly claimed that it was responsible for the Dublin and Monaghan bombs in May 1975 which claimed the lives of thirty-two people. 
&gt; 
&gt; the motive behind these bombs was to let the Irish Government and the people of the republic know what the unionist community was suffering in their name at the hands of the IRA.
&gt; 
&gt; Another key tactic employed by the UVF and RHC as a means of generating fear and terror within the nationalist community was the random assassination of nationalists. 
&gt; 
&gt; statistics clearly show that the vast majority of nationalists shot by the UVF and RHC were ordinary members of the nationalist community, not republican terrorists. 
&gt;  
&gt; the nationalist community in general was the main target

It's just not common and requires practice.

The most logic option right now would be to put Sakho on the right, as it makes it easier for Agger to pass with his stronger foot. A right footed striker running on Sakho also means he still tackles and blocks with his strong foot. Biggest problem is when he needs to block crosses from out wide if covering for Johnson.

Or Agger could move to the right, leaving Sakho in his natural position. This would make room for Ilori as right CB. The more long term solution.

But these are professional footballers. I am certain they can learn to block and make short passes with their weak foot.

I do not believe that Gerrard has simply become a DM maestro, although he has ABSOLUTELY improved immensely since his first few performances where many people (including myself) were doubting his ability to remain in our starting 11. 

But it is the defensive work of Flanno that's been very important for us. I have always been a bigger fan of Enrique on this sub than most of our fans (he's someone whose criticism I never quite understood, aside from not being so great with passing sometimes and the occasional mental lapse), but right now I can only think if it isn't broke why fix it?

On the other hand, I think we can all agree that one of the main reasons we've improved is that Brendan has done a number on Coutinho and Sturridge's backtracking. Suarez and Sterling I think always busted ass, at least this season, but Coutinho and Sturridge have both really come on since January with their work behind the halfway line.

This is the big news I think.  I've worked modelling risk for people with life insurance and pensions.  I'd have liked them to go one step further.

In some countries (not the UK!) it is legal to buy someone's life insurance and continue the fees, then receive all the money come payday.  Think of it this way, you've got someone who's earning quite a lot of money, but came from nothing, they likely have a mortgage, want to keep their family in the lifestyle that they've become accustomed, so they get a very large life insurance policy, a few million quid.  But fast forward 20 years, and they don't need it any more, the kids have left home, are supporting themselves, so people simply cancel the policy.  However you'll get jack all money back.  Which is where a free market can help, they will look at how long you have to live (annuity data) how much the monthly payments are, and offer you a price to buy out your policy, they will continue running it until you die.  It's macabre but no more so than life insurance in general.

We watched one episode a week (I think it was Friday nights) until we got to the penultimate episode. We left it a few weeks before watching the last one, which gave me time to soak in the hilarity and social commentary of the show.

[I'll point out here that I had no idea what was going to happen in the final episode]

I was roaring with laughter all through the episode, wondering how Blackadder, George and Baldrick where going to get out of it this time. Then suddenly:

&gt; Well, it'll have to wait. Good luck everyone.

In a nutshell, Aspas is a ""jack of all trades, master of none"" type of player. His range of abilities and skills gives him the versatility to play almost every position up front (traditional centre-forward, second striker, deep-lying forward, winger, inverted wide-forward - you name it!). 

While Aspas is reasonably good across the board, he still hasn't shown the consistency that is so, so vital in the Premier League, and while he is good, there are many out there that are a lot better. Heck, I'd have Fabio Borini above him in the pecking order next season.

2nd time: Took it in town 5 miles away and had notoriously low pass rate. Failed due to signalling at mini roundabouts instead of going straight accross.
3rd time: Failed due to accelleration control being terrible. Was the same guy as took my test on the 2nd time and wasn't the nicest.

5th time: Failed due to pulling out in front of a lorry (same tester as 4th).
6th time: Failed due to going on a dual carriageway and wasn't familiar with it.

I then moved to Manchester, and passed 1st time on the new test. It was the WORST test. I had an ambulance, and thought I failed early on by pulling out in front of a vehicle, but I stopped it.

His determination and drive would've done our team a world of good.

I felt Downing was the type of player who is capable of good moves but not in teams who aren't tailored to his style of play. He has a mean cross and anticipates play well, however, unless there's a target man in it, he really doesn't offer much else to his team. You will rarely see him drive past a defender with a ball or cut inside from the flank to penetrate into the box. Like it or not, his greatest quality is his ability with the ball when nobody is near him and that type of player simply doesn't have many good prospects in the modern game.

I don't think women necessarily hate the topics that Sci Fi often deals with, simply the format in which it is displayed. Exceptions apply, obviously, like always.

There's of course also the fact that the secondary protagonist is nearly always a woman who often has her own story, more or less.

As a final blow, tax relief on decommissioning was pegged at 20%.

Sturridge scored some good goals for us, but the majority of the time he was so irritating. He was so, so selfish - refused to pass, would bottle out of tackles, and would shoot from ridiculous areas. He would do that all game, frustrate everyone - then if he scored, he would pull out his dance moves as if he was the next Messi. 

I remember one particular match I was watching at a pub full of Chelsea boys, and the whole room was going mental with frustration at him. He scored towards the end of the game, and when he celebrated like he was in Saturday Night Fever, everyone in the room was screaming at him to fuck off and leave our club. That's after he scored. 

So no, I've not missed him at all. No Chelsea fan would deny that he could score goals. Of course he could. When he moved to Liverpool I told everybody that would listen that he would be a huge success there. 

Ultimately, I think, sometimes a player just doesn't fit - with the club, with the fans, with the culture. He was just one of those misfits. 

Really pleased for him that he's doing so well, and fingers crossed he does well for England in the World Cup.

true,WastedTruth,null,null,"Hi there, how long have you been learning for?

It took me 21 years of driving on a provisional, to pass first time.

I had some lessons when I was 17 but it wasn't going well and after a particularly harrowing lesson I gave up, but I still drove occasionally on various relatives' insurance.  When my wife became pregnant with our first child in 1997, I promised her I'd pass my test before the baby was born.  I was still too scared though and didn't take lessons then.

After that, we had years where I didn't have enough money to learn, years when I had money but not time, years when I worked away from home in London and didn't need to drive - I found every excuse under the sun not to press on with it.

And I don't know what finally tipped the balance - maybe it was the sight of the big four-zero birthday looming - but a couple of years ago I started taking proper lessons.  I had a lot more than I think most people do - probably about 50 hours at least, before I felt ready to take my test.

On the day, I was terrified.  I even hit the curb during one of the manoeuvres - but somehow, I passed.

That was six months ago and I've driven about 150 miles most days since then (previously, I'd had a horrendous train journey) and have gained confidence and really enjoy driving far more than I ever thought I would.  A couple of weeks ago I headed up to north Yorkshire, drove the Buttertubs pass and roads like that, had loads of fun! And last week, I met up with my instructor again for a half day of additional training, where he said the transformation was phenomenal.

So... Please don't give up.  You've had far more courage than I did to take your test, so press on, keep going, and you will do it.  The Best is Yet to Come!",0,1395318002,null,0,false,0,cg7bk90,t3_20w6f5,t1_cg7bk90,t3_20w6f5,null,1432989050,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

1) There are way more hazards than they recognise in the marking. For instance, a car could be pulling up to a junction at speed, which I see as a hazard as they may pull out infront of me and I might have to react. You can't click them all as there is a limit to the number of registered clicks before you get disqualified for spamming the button.

2) You get marked based on the time that you click, which means if you spot the hazard earlier than you're supposed to you get no points. Like for example, seeing a bus at a stop which you anticipate as a potential hazard, but you click before it indicates to pull out, because apparently a stationary bus blocking your whole lane requires no sort of reaction from you as a driver.

true,tigernmas,,Monaghan,"The comparisons between Bosnia and Northern Ireland are interesting. 

I remember hearing somewhere, though I need to verify it, that some of the rise in ethnic nationalism to extreme levels in Bosnia can be attributed to the funds the US was channelling to ""pro-democracy"" groups which also happened to be far right, anti-communist nationalists. There wasn't the same outside interests trying to influence Northern Ireland to the extent that happened in Yugoslavia.

But aside from that, the Bosnian conflict lead to a similar settlement to what the GFA did here, called the Dayton Agreement. Where we have power sharing, they had a sort of repartitioned federation but there are similarities in how the whole set up puts an emphasis on ethnicity and making sure nothing can be done if one group doesn't agree.

The results have been somewhat similar to here. You now have a body of politicians who only try to cater to their own side that will vote for them and have it in their own interest to perpetuate their situation by keeping tensions simmering. They play with nationalism when they don't like the way things are going, kind of like when the DUP started inciting the loyalists before the fleg thing kicked off.

But currently there is something very interesting going on in Bosnia, especially from a Northern Irish perspective. There have been widespread protests across the country, burning government buildings and police cars. The government resigned, the police disappeared in some towns and incredibly democratic people's assemblies appeared in major towns and cities including the capital to vote and put out their demands. It is like Occupy Wall Street if it got things done.  

It all happened very quickly but the most remarkable thing is that the protesters were unified across ethnicity against these nationalist politicians who were dividing them for political gain. They had a great slogan ""we're hungry in three languages!"". They banned all political parties from their people's assemblies, or plenums, to keep the nationalists from distorting it and one of their major demands was a new form of government that put those with the skills in charge rather than the old nationalists. Opinion polls seem to suggest the movement has an 80% approval rate.

It's all ongoing at the moment and the media has been very quiet about it, Crimea has overshadowed it. But I think it is very interesting and people in Northern Ireland should look into it and see what we can learn from them so that we can work towards a fresher kind of politics.

And at the time, I didn't believe. Then came the back to back losses at the Etihad and Stamford Bridge, and I felt vindicated. But now we're top of the form table. We're second in the league and if we beat City and Chelsea at Anfield we need City to drop two points (or one point and to have our goal difference improved by four more than theirs over the rest of the season). City have to go to United and Chelsea.

Wait so you're accusing them of being Nazi now? I thought they were fascist a minute ago? I think that one needs to be careful not to overuse terms such as fascist or nazi, lest others start ignoring the term. I don't like svoboda very much, I don't agree with their socially conservative positions, but to imply that them being anti-abortion (Ireland, USA), Anti-gay (Pretty much anywhere in eastern Europe, Russia, and all Africa), or favouring their own culture via legislation (France), is in some way fascist seems to me to just weaken the very term. They're certainly a right wing party, but given the members of Svoboda in the cabinet are currently all elected MP's and they're not going with the campaign slogan ""wir mussen die juden aus rotten"", I think you're being overly opposed to them on the basis that you don't like socially conservative right wing parties.

true,paleogirl,mccoy,McCoy,"&gt; I don't like that he was willing to abandon Rose like he did.

But... that's the point. The Doctor lies. It's a defining point of the character. It's also a valuable life lesson; when someone treats other people in a certain way, then says he would never treat *you* like that because you are different and special... if you stay and buy into that story, you deserve exactly what you will eventually get.

The Fourth Doctor sent Sarah Jane away (""abandoned"" her) to protect her when he was recalled to Gallifrey by the Time Lords. He could have gone back for her afterwards, but it was not in his nature to do so.

The Ninth Doctor sent Rose away to protect her (essentially abandoning her on Earth) during *Parting of the Ways*. This is after multiple instances of him *threatening* to abandon her if she didn't agree with his opinions as to how things should happen-- see *The Unquiet Dead* and *Father's Day*, to name two.
 
She rescued herself to return to him from that abandonment, which I felt at the time (and still believe) was a positive evolution of the Doctor Who story, since it gave Rose a degree of agency that Classic companions weren't always allowed.

However, the Tenth Doctor continued to send Rose away or abandon her repeatedly-- in *Girl in the Fireplace*, *Doomsday*, and finally *Journey's End*, and, in my eyes, Rose's continued insistence on coming back no matter what the consequences began to border on the pathetic.

At any rate, those who think that Ten leaving Rose on the the *Madame du Pompadour* was out of character are watching the show through a selective mental filter, to say the least. (And I am aware, by the way, that you didn't say this-- just that you didn't *like* it, which is certainly more than fair!)

The difference between 05 and now for me is that Utd have two world class players but the rest are mediocre apart from De Gea and Vidic who's head is in Milan. They are also very short on confidence. Unlike us in 05 were we only had Stevie that was world class we also had some good players that were very solid like Carra, Sami, Finnan at the back, in midfield we had Alonso, Stevie and Hamman (in the second half) and as an attacking threat Baros and Garcia. Apart from Alonso and Carra none would be regarded as World beaters but all very good players on their day.

The same just can't be said about Utd, yes they have two world class forwards but I can't see them making many chances against Real, Barca or Munich if their midfield is overran and doesn't have the ball. Their midfield at the moment is mid table at best as Newcastle, Spurs, Everton and even West Brom have dominated the midfield at OT this season and unlike us in 05 we could defend because that was some Benitez was excellent at when we needed a result. Moyes does not have that about him and even last night Utd were lucky not to concede and against a very average team by CL standards.

It doesn't improve anyone's knowledge (I don't think anyone's make up free face informed me that the UK's cancer survival rates are significantly lower than those in Europe) or make people engage with the issues at hand.  It doesn't create any lasting improvement or significant change.  All it does is give a few charities a small extra blip in their funding (cancer research takes in more than a million a day on average anyway), and makes a few people feel good about themselves (which is probably why it caught on so much in the first place) and then forget all about it.  Bunging £3 to cancer research is all well and good, but it's going to do nothing to alter things like unequal access to healthcare, nor even raise people's awareness that such a thing exists.  The only awareness raised is that of what someone's actual human face looks like, which just serves to abstract you further away from the real problems.

Let's not even get into the issue that reinforcing the fact that it's somehow 'novel' or 'brave' for women to show their faces without a layer of slap on is just incredibly patronising.

Harry was no some messianic guru who was going to lead us to titles, he was and always has been a solid premier league manager. He is a manager with a career winning % of 37% (lower % than Pardew, Allardyce, Moyes or Bruce), had a losing record against United, City, Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool (when LFC was in a downturn) while he was with us. He was 65 when we sacked him he has never won a title, he has won a single cup.  

He had a very good run with Spurs and deserves a great deal of credit. He took a team from the releagation zone to the CL and then had an absolutely brilliant run. But he was fortunate to land at Spurs when we had Modric and Bale (and yes he moved him from LB to LM for which he deserves a great deal of credit) and then was gifted VDV by Levy on deadline day 10/11. Also important to keep in mind was that LFC was in a down period during this time, from 00/01 - 08/09 LFC had averaged finishing 4th with a CL title, a CL runner up, A Europa League title, 2 FA cups, a League Cup and 2 Super cups. From 09/10 they averaged finishing 7th. Let's also not forget that he fucked off for 3 months in 11/12 and squandered a 10 point lead on Arsenal.  For all the good Harry did for us (and he did quite a bit) he also had some luck and some real poor points.

Have we gone backwards this season? Yes. But we are still in 5th despite going backwards. We have been worse off before. I don't believe Sherwood is the answer at manager but AVB wasn't either. 

Keep the performance of the past few years in perspective, we were a mid table (or lower) team as little as 5 seasons ago. We have made fantastic strides forward but we are not City, Chelsea or United so we can't spend like they do and we haven't had a manager the same quality of Wenger.

true,PeaSouper,english,American/Canadian Expat,"&gt; Well I don't think that, but it's arguably more fair than targeting people who earn even less.

I'm not suggesting targeting anyone, I'm just saying that these tax breaks should be extended to everyone, not just those earning below a certain threshold.

&gt; That said, you're being a bit dishonest by making it a ""family"" argument. Income tax is a personal tax, and if your family decides to raise the whole family on one income, that isn't the governments fault.

Some countries, including the United States, treat income tax as a family tax, and I'd argue that the UK should do the same.  When I lived in the US, I could allocate half of my income to my wife, such that not only could we take advantage of her tax-free allowance, we could also have more of my income taxed at a lower tax bracket.

And why not?  As an individual, taxes are generally higher on your 100,000th pound than they are on your 20,000th pound, because you get more marginal use out of your 20,000th pound.  This is why it's deemed fairer to tax those on higher incomes at a higher marginal rate.  However, I'd argue that as a family, you get just as much use out of your 50,000th pound whether two earners are earning it, or just one.  

&gt; I can quite easily say that two people with combined income of £82k/yr are doing quite well.

And you'd be right.  Two people each earning £41k are doing quite well.  But the real question, for the purpose of this debate, is are they significantly worse off than a family where one wage-earner makes £82k, and the other one makes nothing at all?  Because that latter family is taxed far more.",0,1395329756,null,0,false,0,cg7frnz,t3_20soqw,t1_cg7frnz,t1_cg7armk,null,1432991031,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;Under the Road Traffic Act 1988, the first doctor to provide emergency treatment to the victim of a road traffic accident is generally entitled to charge a fee:

&gt;    A fee may be levied in respect of each person treated (Section 158(2)
&gt;   Mileage is also payable in excess of two miles

&gt;Since 1999 the ability to levy a fee under S158 of the Road Traffic Act, has been limited to claims by doctors not working in NHS hospitals, as the cost of hospital treatment is recovered from insurers directly by the NHS.

&gt;The fee can be levied even if the person driving the vehicle at the time of the accident is on the GP's NHS list. 


The text goes on a bit more but the BMA guideline is

&gt;Under such circumstances where a claim is to be made, the BMA professional fees committee believes that the patient should be seen within one working day. 

outside of this 24 hour period you 'should' not be charged

You can do that, but it's not as bad as that.

When I worked in A&amp;E, we would have to get the patients to sign a form if they had whiplash or whatever, as the NHS would claim back part of the cost of treatment from the insurer in the event of a claim.  GPs get asked to sign all sorts of bollocks.  Things like ""Mr X wants to go skydiving, can you sign his medical form off for us"" and ""Mrs Y wants to go on a cruise, but before we will give travel insurance we want you to go through her entire case file to see if there's anything we can use to increase her premium"".  Companies often expect this to be done for free.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Redknapp was no messiah but his brilliant man-management had us playing the best football in the league. You can say he had some good players to work with but all the big clubs have good players.

You talk about him throwing away a 10 point lead over Arsenal but doesn't he deserve credit for getting the team 10 points ahead of Arsenal in the first place? The truth is two top four finishes out of the three is a fantastic record for a club like Spurs. 

Finishing fourth above nouveau rich City and again above Champions League winners Chelsea were phenomenal achievements plus we were the most exciting team in the Champions League when we qualified.

With our wage bill Redknapp was clearly over-achieving. We were toe to toe with Arsenal. It was madness to take our position for granted and let him go without a proven world class replacement. AVB was a failure at Chelsea and came in as a massive risk.

The decision to sack Redknapp after finishing fourth has failed spectacularly. We dropped to fifth under AVB, lost our best player and we've now fallen significantly behind the top clubs. We're stuck with a totally unbalanced squad of mostly promising players who lack courage and leadership. Even if the likes of Lamela and Eriksen turn into world class players in a year or so, will key players Vertonghen and Lloris still be here without Champions League football?

What frustrates me most is this season was the one where we could have seriously had a title tilt and comfortably made the top four. Instead, thanks to Levy, we are experiencing a transition bigger than most, and worse, we don't have a proper manager in place. This effectively means next season will be another in transition. City, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool and Man Utd will all strengthen their squads in the summer while we are busy thinking about whether to give Sherwood the job or the hand the poisoned chalice to another mug for six months. Levy has dragged our club backwards since summer 2012. Instead of enjoying a great Spurs team led by Redknapp with Bale our star man, we're left hoping that our expensively assembled young squad will one day turn into the exciting team that two years ago we had in place.

I think that the fact we are fifth disguises what has been a pretty disastrous season. A series of barely deserved 1-0 wins against weak opposition has kept us in the top six. Numerous humiliating defeats in the league and pitiful cup exits has made it a season to forget. The fact City are 45 goals better off than us tells its own story.

The way I see it now, we simply have to make a spectacular managerial appointment to lift the team this summer and avoid falling behind the big five at the top.",0,1395333692,null,0,1395334067,0,cg7hn1m,t3_20w7go,t1_cg7hn1m,t1_cg7faku,null,1432991984,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

An employer doesn’t usually have to give a work reference - but if they do, it must be fair and accurate. Workers may be able to challenge a reference they think is unfair or misleading.

Employers must give a reference if:

**there was a written agreement to do so**

they’re in a regulated industry, eg financial services

If they give a reference it:

must be fair and accurate - and can include details about workers’ performance and if they were sacked

can be brief - eg job title, salary and when the worker was employed

*Once the worker starts with a new employer they can ask to see a copy of a reference. They have no right to ask their previous employer.*

Why isn't everyone jumping on board?  How can I say, we all make our own decisions.  That being said, Wall Street interest is starting to trickle in.

People are working on an ETF for bitcoin; and when the same happened with gold, the price took an enormous leap because it became easily tradeable in wall street's existing systems.  A NY-regulated exchange is in the process of starting up, and millions are being invested by venture capitalists into bitcoin companies.  That hardly seems like the negative situation you imply.

Warren Buffet is not the arbiter of all that is good in this world; he's also old guard financial, part of the group that bitcoin is replacing.  It takes time for new technologies to be understood and bitcoin is incredibly complicated if you start digging into it.  Exactly the same sort of attitudes were seen in the 90s with respect to the Internet.  As time passes, and understanding trickles through the financial world, it's hard to see how they can fail to adopt bitcoin to some degree.  Bitcoin transactions recently outstripped Western Union in volume for example.

&gt; because it's completely unreliable

In what way is it unreliable?  Has a single bitcoin transaction not gone through on the bitcoin network itself?  Has the bitcoin software lost anyone any coins, other than through their own mismanagement of their wallet?  The price in some other currency is not a factor that is built into bitcoin whatsoever, so if you're talking about reliability of price then that's an orthogonal issue.

&gt; and nobody wants money that halves in value overnight.

Quite so.  But that's only a function of low adoption, not of bitcoin implicitly.  How else do you imagine a newly growing replacement currency would behave?  Far too many people seem to think that if bitcoin isn't instantly a 100 trillion dollar market cap, and as integrated as the financial services that have existed for 50 years then it's a failure.  Obviously untrue.  There is no way it can just appear, fully formed and stable in the world.  As with everything, first we try, then we trust -- early adopters are taking a risk, and in exchange they have potential for a big reward.

""Halves overnight"" is also hyperbolic.  There have been a few big drops, but they've been universally followed by large recoveries.  That bitcoin is thinly traded is inevitable in a growing currency, with low volume comes big variations.  What matters is that the price recovers fast after these shocks.  For merchants, there are payment services (e.g. bitpay) who will take on these currency risks for you, so it's irrelevant for them anyway.

Do I mind that you don't want to buy in?  Not in the slightest.  Not being a Ponzi scheme, I have no need for people to be tricked into buying in.  What I object to is thoughtless pronouncements like yours that ""nobody wants it"" -- it's thoughtless because I can go out and sell a bitcoin for dollars; overstock have taken a million dollars in bitcoins; tiger direct have taken similar; scan.co.uk have started accepting them; so ""nobody wants"" is just plain wrong.",0,1395334968,null,0,1395335477,0,cg7i9zo,t3_20w0qr,t1_cg7i9zo,t1_cg7c8bx,null,1432992282,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

KopKopPlayer, are you just arguing for the sake of argument?

There's *many* centerback pairings with only right footed players, that work great. It can work for two left footed as well. Not every player is as one footed as RvP.

One of the reasons you rarely see leftie-leftie, is because (as you mention) there are few. There are (as you also mention) many great left footed centerbacks. How many of these are benched because they are stronger on the wrong foot? Not many.

The marginals play a big part when you're talking the difference between class and world class. It comes down to who eats right and keeps fit, keeps ahead of the game mentally and also plays with the right foot - but if Sakho is a better CB played at RCB compared to Skrtl, he will start if BR sees it that way.

It's that simple (when compared player to player): If Sakho &gt; Skrtl as RCB, Sakho starts.

Then there's the whole ""will he upset the balance""-issue and the old saying that you don't change a winning side (or break up a winning pair for that matter).",0,1395336216,null,0,false,0,cg7iw9h,t3_20tl7n,t1_cg7iw9h,t1_cg7iqz2,null,1432992573,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

A mortgage advisor has access to tens of mortgages that you will be eligible for, and will be able to tell you the total cost over the fixed period in order to compare rates &amp; fees. They have access to huge databases that is not available to the public.

If you go direct to a bank you get a very narrow view of what deal you could get. For example if I went direct to Halifax I would soon be paying £1000 arrangement fee and 4.75% on a 2 year fixed. Instead my mortgage advisor found that Skipton would offer me £400 arrangement fee and 3.75% on a fixed 2 year. (10% deposit). This has saved me around £2000 over 2 years.

You can easily find a mortgage advisor who is:

a) Whole of market

b) Won't charge you anything up front because they make money from commission.

Last piece of advice from me, having gone through all of this in the last 2 months, is to ensure you do not apply for too many mortgages in principal.

true,ricecows,lfc99,,"As of now, Skrtel is the bruiser and Agger is the passer. Replace Sakho with Skrtel and that system would remain unchanged (allthough Sakho is a better passer than Skrtel).

Best player always plays regardless of what foot he uses. If Philip Lahm was shit with his left foot, he would never play left back for Germany, regardless of being one of the best fullbacks in the world, because he isn't a better *left* fullback than the best left footed fullback in Germany (incidentally he is decent with his left foot, and often plays on that side for Germany...).

So if Sakho is a better RCB than Skrtel, including being a better passer with his right foot, he will play (if we're only talking ability wise and leaving the mental game and current form out of it). Even if he is a poorer passer, but if BR believes he will improve the defense, he could play on the right side.

I agree with you completely that it is unlikely to see this season, and that it would not be the optimal pairing - but it's not impossible and it will not be as terrible as many people believe.

From personal experience, having played all 4 positions at the backline, it is easier to tackle with your ""wrong"" foot when pressing an attacker outside. This is why tackles like Phillip Lahms popular sliding tackle (where he takes the ball with his heel rather than laces) is quite normal. The real issue is if the left footed RCB plays against a left footed striker...

Passing it around with short passes is fairly easy to learn for a disciplined player. Long passes can be tricky. Judging from the last few games, our CBs rarely play the 40 yard pass to the strikers (like Kompany for City), but rather play it to the fullbacks or more often: to the holding midfielder who lays it off to the midfielders, attackers or fullbacks.

Sakho is young and it would be easier to school him to play ""on the wrong side"". But Agger would be a better choice (from my point of view) as Illori looks like the RCB of the future, and Sakho as LCB.

Playing on the wrong side is not ""just something you do"", as Kolo has shown over and over this season, but it is very much possible.

But the change will only happen, if the wrong-footed player will improve the team. Which should be obvious. You would rather play a world class defender on his wrong side, than an amateur who plays in his perfect position.

Skrtel is no amateur and have been very good this season, which is probably why we haven't seen a Sakho/Agger pairing. If he was shit, it would be a no brainer for BR.",0,1395337908,null,0,false,0,cg7jqpv,t3_20tl7n,t1_cg7jqpv,t1_cg7j0tx,null,1432992971,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"We fell to 5th last season with the highest point total in the history of our club. Hard to see how Harry could have improved on that as it was done with Bale. As i said i don't think AVB was the answer, i personally think a great deal of our success from last season was because Bale's performance plastered over our inability to create and score otherwise.

To say we could have had a title run this season under Harry (or virtually any manager for that manner) is grasping horribly at straws. It ignores the fact that City and Chelsea are far better teams with much, much more talented managers than Harry. Arsenal and LFC are quality squads with better managers. Pelligrini, Mou, Wenger and Rodgers don't rely on players enjoying their time with the team to win games, they can actually manage a team in the locker room and on the pitch. 

Harry has always struggled against top managers and top teams in his career and didn't exactly light the world on fire against top teams when he was with us (he had a losing record against City/Chelsea/United/Arsenal/LFC).  This is a manager who has had less success than Moyes and won a fewer % of his games than Big Sam, Steve Bruce or Alan Pardew. 

Harry started this season with the most talented team in the Championship and currently is 17pts behind Leicester, 10 points behind Burnley and even with Derby but with a worse goal differential.  With arguably one of, if not the most, talented teams in the Championship Harry is currently getting blown away for the automatic bid for promotion by 2 different teams and now wouldn't even be the favourite to win the playoff. He is getting out coached by Pearson, Dyche and McClaren...how would he compete with Pelligrini, Mou, Rodgers and Wenger?  As you said all good teams have good players, he has good players for the level he is at and is still failing to meet expectations.

What we had with the squad and Harry was effectively lightning in a bottle.  As the makeup of the squad changed through transfers an age the chemistry was going to change, when man mangement is the most effective tool you have in you manigerial bag of tricks you will end up at some point being exposed by better managers with equal/better teams.  That is what would have happened with Harry. We were never going to chase a title with him, odds are we would be in the same spot in the table that we are now.

I agree that we need a major change in management from Sherwood, i think sticking with Tim will ultimately do more harm than good.

I think we are more relying on SAF and Charlton to convince the board that Moyes is the man for the job at United and deserves time. Unfortunately i don't know how long that will actually last.  I just have a gut feeling about Klopp being United's dream appointment...not nessisarily relying on it.

We could still in effect be forced out by it changing into something that it is simply not in our interest to be a member of.

true,cronus89,null,null,"Assuming you get approved (shouldn't be too big a problem if your credit is good), you are looking at around 4.89% to 5.19% APR on most high street mortgages with an LTV (Loan to value ratio) of 95%.

This means that for a 30 year term on an initial fixed rate for 2 years you could be looking at around £550 a month mortgage payment. If you are already saying you are saving £700 a month you could even consider overpaying and you could have the thing paid off by the time you are in your 40s. 

Of course, interest rates are likely to rise long before then so the amount you have to pay might well increase after the initial 2 years.

The rates for 95% mortgages are pretty bad (5% ish) but after the 2 year initial term you should have a lower LTV and should be able to negotiate an improved deal, maybe something around 3%...

You didn't mention salary, but by the fact you are renting and still able to save £700 I guess you have a decent income coming in. Consider having a look at a site like this: http://caniaffordtobuy.co.uk/SR-foh which will give you a good idea on what you can afford. This site also tells you what your payments might be like when the interest rates go up.

Edit: Obviously I am not a mortgage advisor, I'd recommend seeing a real one! 

Edit 2: Also, consider all of the other fees, legal, insurance etc that you will need. A good idea to have a few thousand left as well as your deposit before you buy...lots of little things soon add up, again the CanIAffordToBuy site explains a lot of this.",0,1395341068,null,0,1395341398,0,cg7lcym,t3_20wl8n,t1_cg7lcym,t3_20wl8n,null,1432993734,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3

a) her bravery in going bare (which shouldn't be even be a thing)

b) how stunningly beautiful she looked despite not wearing any make up

she even apologised in advance to encourage people to comment on how she looked in support for her brave act. 

I don't know of anyone on facebook or otherwise that hasn't heard of cancer and these posts give no extra information other than the phrase ""cancer awareness"". People think to themselves, ""yes, I know about cancer"" and so don't bother to learn more. Nothing is done to challenge the view of ""it'll never happen to me"".

Some posts included a screenshot of a donation, which while being rather smug, at least does *something* to help. Cancer research receive approx. 1 million pounds a day anyway though so a million extra for one day is a small blip.

The best thing a trend like this could do is alter peoples attitudes towards cancer (as they last longer) and to encourage people to check themselves for lumps etc. I think I saw one post that suggested this.

I realise that any benefit is better than none from a trend such as this, but it was vastly infuriating to see people feeling smug about making such a sacrifice ""for charity"" when all they did was take a picture of themselves.

Here's a copy of an email i sent to the reading Chronicle today. They haven't yet responded!

Dear sirs,

You write today in your newspaper, The Reading Chronicle, that ""Football hooliganism may be thought of as a relic from a previous age when gangs of denim-clad skinheads held the game to ransom and names like Hillsborough and Heysel were symbols of its ills.""

I'd like to ask if you really believe that Hillsborough was a 'symbol of the ills of hooliganism""? If not, why write such a slur? And why at the very sensitive time of the current Hillsborough inquest? 

I have read your editor Maurice O'Brien's reply to the Liverpool Echo which seems to offer not an apology but rather excuses and justifications for the article. 

Surely you must see the irony when Maurice says,""There was no intention whatsoever to cast any aspersions at all and indeed, on page 5 inside the paper, we talk about sickening Hillsborough slurs which have been shouted at football matches."" as a defense for your front page this very day casting further aspersions and slurs?

His further defense that, ""It is simply the fact at that time, when it happened, when you said to people 'football hooligans', people said 'Hillsborough and Heysel' is simply untrue. People may have erroneously and, as we have learnt, were maliciously encouraged to, point blame at late/drunk/ticket less Liverpool fans but never have I heard the mention of hooliganism connected to Hillsborough. I lived the first 20 years of my life in Liverpool and the next 20 years in London and your article today is the first time I have ever seen hooliganism connected to Hillsborough!

Maurice's claim that ""We certainly in no way would wish to link Hillsborough with hooliganism. That certainly wasn't our intention."" rings very hollow since that is exactly what his newspaper has done today. Perhaps an apology or the word 'sorry' would lend more sincerity to your denials, perhaps!

I would like to ask, how it is possible that this comment made it past your editorial team? Surely, Anthony or James must have known that this would be controversial? You must agree that it is easy to suppose that, considering the nature of the article itself, and all the sensationalist fear-mongering therein, that controversy was your very intention?

Perhaps Sheila Coleman from the HJC sums it up better:

*Sheila Coleman, from the Hillsborough Justice Campaign (HJC), called for action to be taken against the Reading Chronicle.*

*Ms Coleman said: ""At a time when we are effectively being gagged from commenting on issues around Hillsborough and we're closely following the coroner's rules, it is appalling that an irresponsible press can choose to repeat the lies of Hillsborough that were put to bed a long time ago. There has got to be some recourse to this.*

*""We are being told we can't comment and we have a newspaper, no matter how obscure, linking Hillsborough with hooliganism.*

*""The HJC would hope the coroner would seize upon this as flouting the coroner's ruling and that appropriate action is taken.*

*""At a time when families and survivors are being extra cautious about saying anything to the press and on social media and are adhering to the coroner's guidelines, we have a newspaper being wholly irresponsible and it could be seen to be being provocative and provoking a response.""*

Like Sheila, I also hope the coroner takes approppiate action.
Sincerely disappointed.

&gt;In what way is it unreliable?  

when was the last time the US dollar or the euro dropped to a tenth of its value because a magic: the gathering website went offline? 

&gt;then that's an orthogonal issue

so you think a currency being unreliable in its value isn't relevant to how reliable it is as a currency. You're giving everyone insight into the mind of a bitcoin supporter here, I guess.

&gt;Quite so. But that's only a function of low adoption, not of bitcoin implicitly.

and we're talking about bitcoin, which has a low adoption rate. It's 100% relevant here, and though you're very clever for spotting this isn't exclusively true for bitcoin that doesn't mean it excuses bitcoin in any way.

If your car insurance costs $10,000 a year and they tell you it's because they have low adoption and all the other customers are shitty, do you swap to the large $400 a year company or do you stick with them and hope more people use your insurer?

&gt;""Halves overnight"" is also hyperbolic. 

it really isn't. bitcoin has slumped massively and suddenly several times since passing $1/btc and in fact, **right now** it's hovering at about $600 down from over $1100. A few weeks ago it slumped to a bit over $100 when mtgox went under.

Again, you seem to think that by telling me bitcoin doesn't have many users you're going to convince me all the problems don't matter. You aren't helping bitcoin's case, you're just describing the problem to me in greater detail. Bank robbers aren't set free because they explain they wanted money, drink driving isn't acceptable when you tell the policeman you wanted to go home, bitcoin losing massive amounts of value without warning isn't ok just because it has poor capitalisation

&gt;For merchants, there are payment services (e.g. bitpay) who will take on these currency risks for you, so it's irrelevant for them anyway.

why do I care about that? are bitpay going to let me convert my money into btc for free when I make the transaction? because if not, that just means the risk is still there for the bitcoins I have.

Companies use bitcoin because customers will complain if they don't.

true,EvilBlueSmartie,null,null,"I don't disagree with you, and perhaps I should have said they maintain, rather than provide, these services. Though to what degree they maintain these services is, and always will be, up for debate.

The NHS is always a hot topic because it is something that is so important to everyone, some much more than others. That said, it is also much more delicate. It's very easy to say ""I could do it better"", but really everyone has a different idea on how it should be run. There are many areas where it could be improved on to both save money and improve services, but that's always slow to happen with an organisation of this size.

If privatising parts of the NHS will improve care or make it more cost effective to provide care to the millions of people it is responsible for, then who are we to condemn that decision? There are many people who know much more about this than we do debating this very thing. Governments will always make changes and people will always talk about it and vilify them for it. But being so delicate, the NHS is not something they can simply turn inside out and ""fix"", because if you did the whole system would collapse. It will take decades of small changes and trial and error for any improvements to be made. 

I have friends who are still alive thanks to the NHS, and I dread to think what would have been had we not had it. The NHS provided the treatment I needed when I was going through depression. Despite the many criticisms it receives, it doesn't change the fact that many of the people who complain about it would not be here if wasn't for them.

true,[deleted],null,null,"AVB arrived with a superb team already in place and Bale on an upward trajectory. That record points total was largely down to Bale's incredible streak of winning games single-handedly. For us not to make the top four with the best player in the league was failure, record points or not.

When I say we would have challenged for the title under Redknapp this season what I mean is that with City and Chelsea in transition, the top four are all title contenders. If we had Bale and a settled management team we would be up there. That's not clutching at straws. It's a perfectly reasonable assumption to make.

You say Redknapp struggled against better managers but our record against Wenger's Arsenal was W2 D12 L14 before Redknapp and W3 D2 L3 during Redknapp's time as manager. That's right we won more games against Arsenal in Redknapp's three seasons than in the previous 12 seasons.

Comparing Redknapp's Premier League record to other managers is pointless as you are comparing apples and pears. Redknapp has taken over about four or five teams who were bottom of the league so he's inevitably going to suffer plenty defeats even if he turns around a team's fortunes.

Any team getting relegated from the Premier League faces an incredibly difficult challenge to win promotion immediately. QPR are comfortably in the play-off spots and could easily come straight back up. I think he's done quite well to have them in the top six all season. He is not being out-coached by anyone. If you put Mourinho in charge of QPR in the Championship they would not walk that league.

I am not saying Redknapp is one of the world's greatest managers and I agree he will struggle to out-fox a genius like Mourinho however when you have the sixth highest wage bill in the league it's a near-impossible job to make the top four without doing something special. Redknapp got the best out of our players. He made their self-belief go through the roof. We saw great attacking football as the team was going out and expressing themselves.

Compare that to what we have now... talented young guys who are short on confidence. The football isn't great to watch but they can eke out results against weaker sides before getting crucified against top opposition.

Either Levy should have stuck with Redknapp and his feel-good factor or brought in a proven world class coach. Hopefully, belatedly, we'll see him arrive this summer in the shape of LVG.",0,1395346029,null,0,false,0,cg7nxq1,t3_20w7go,t1_cg7nxq1,t1_cg7jzaq,null,1432995013,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2
