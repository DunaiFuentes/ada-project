false,threep03k64,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; All it takes to be offensive, is someone to be offended. However offence isn't necessarily racism, even if the term is directly related to a race.

I can agree with that; just because somebody is offended doesn't mean the thing that caused them offense is wrong.  And there is no simple answer for exactly where that line is drawn, which is hurting my brain a little.

My own thought process on this is that offense to the word paki is not some recent social justice warrior thing, it's a word that has long been derogatorily used for the purpose of causing offense and due to that I'd be  cautious using it even for benign reasons. If someone were to say they were having paki food I suppose it wouldn't necessarily make them racist but I would consider them insensitive (because to me reference to the food is a reference to the people and culture).

All I can do is repeat that the line between acceptable and non acceptable words is rather blurry. I wouldn't use the word chinky or paki to refer to food but I suppose the acceptability of such use of the words is down to the opinion of the majority.

Default to who? Southerners? Young people? It isn't to everyone. When my parents use it, they are not awarding the Chinese any particular quality, they are merely referring to the Chinese in a non-PC way. That doesn't make it racist.

The word has never been used in a discriminatory fashion in the UK - My concern is that people are becoming offended by this term not because they are, but because they're told to be.

My issue is that in my town the word has a whole new meaning, but according to people who I share nothing else in common with, other than living on the same rock, I'm a racist bigot because the word holds different connotations for your sub-region than it does mine.

They favour net neutrality, and I have shown you they act against massive multi nationals as they are doing with tax dodging in Ireland/Luxemburg/Netherlands (although these countries are fighting back against it).

I have told you they support development in the UK and not to mention the clout the EU offers when talking about trade deals with the likes of the US which Britains $2.7tn economy compared with the US $16tn economy would be arse rammed in the negotiations with. Instead the $17tn EU is negotiating. You can literally go over and work anywhere across Europe you want, instead of retiring in the UK you could buy a big house in a cheaper (by far) country and retire there. All the while the British pension money would still come to you and be worth a shit load more over in the poorer countries.

The reason we also pay into an EU budget is to develop other countries (why should we pay for developing other European countries?). The answer to why is because the richer they are the more people who can buy British products, it's a short term loss for a long term gain not to mention it reduces immigration by raising their wages by helping to develop their countries. 

Leading on from what EU pressure can do the EU pressure has to lead to several arrests throughout Romania for example because they there not big fans of corruption. Oh and it means we can be part of a political union (one of the big three) that can influence it politically.. see Russias ruble that has fallen so rapidly they have had to raise interest rates by 7% overnight and imports now cost an arm and a leg.

Think we could do that to Russia outside the EU? I could go on all day about the benefits of being in the EU, we're going to living in a multi-polar world, China-US-EU (if it integrates). I personally would rather have a seat at the top table with France and Germany in the EU, rather than being Americas pet dog.

CHIVERS: Chelsea will buy in January. Don’t you think they’ll get a striker? What if Costa gets injured?



HARRIS: Jose brought in three very influential players this summer: Courtois, Fabregas and Costa. They badly needed someone up front and he’s taken the pressure off Hazard to score goals. Hazard’s playing with freedom. This is a better side than the one he had in 2004.



HARRIS: Everything revolves around Matic. Left foot, big fella, he’s a winner. Ivanovic is my kind of player, fully committed and dangerous from set-pieces. Supporters like to see someone having a go. I’ll bet he’s the first name on the sheet. Azpilicueta is another I like. He defends properly.



CHIVERS: He (Jose) went with the strong spine: goalkeeper, centre halves, two in midfield and a striker.


SPENCER: Zola was the best player I’ve seen close-up. [....] After his first session he’s lining up free-kicks, and the first hit the bar and he’s disappointed. He said: ‘A direct free-kick 20 yards from goal is like a penalty kick in my mind’. I’m thinking: ‘In my mind, I’m happy to get it over the wall, into the keeper’s hands’. That’s when I realised there’s levels and then there’s levels. The levels at Chelsea were changing.

If ""chinky"" is meant simply as a noun to define a building that sells a certain type of food, then it is not racist for people who believe that to be its meaning to use the word.

I beg to differ...

The poster said he was in the NorthEast of UK. So I know that he's not using American English (to make a differentiation just as an example).

The word Chinky as used in the UK *is* a derogatory reference to Chinese people not buildings, the UKIP candidate called a woman ""Chinky"" not a restaurant, ergo *your entire point is* **completely moot**.

RE: The ""building thing"" ...

It is called a ""Chinky take away/Chinky Restaurant/Chinky"" as an insult to the Chinese people working there, in the same way as corner shops are called ""Paki shops"" by racists (and by non-racist people that are clearly too fucking stupid to know it makes them look racist to use the term); even though the people at the take-away may not be Chinese, in exactly the same way the people at the corner shop may not be Pakistani...

You can of course play word games as long as you like, that *is* how it *is* though. ;)

TLDR: ""Chinky"" *is* a racist term for the Chinese, get over it (and yourself when you feel you have to argue with that fact).

My advice is to not spend too much time worrying about advice from other people - figure out what's important to you in a wedding and make it happen.  It's tough when you disagree with the other people involved, though.  (We had financial support from my parents, which also meant taking their thoughts into serious advisement!)  For me, it was really important that we have good food and that we invite everyone we wanted (not to exclude anyone we loved) - which meant splashing a lot of money on venue and catering.  We saved in other areas (e.g. decorations were DIY) but venue and catering suck up a lot of money.  I think the best advice I received was for every decision, to think about 5 years from the wedding: at that point, would you regret not going for the more expensive option, or would it have faded from memory?  Would you regret not having whatever you could have spent that money on instead (e.g. a vacation, $$ towards a house, furniture/TVs/whatever) more?

I actually got a lot of support at /r/weddingplanning - no joke.  It's the most sane wedding planning forum out there on the Internet I found, full of mostly reasonable, rational people.  (maybe some budget-shaming, but it's not too bad)

Rightful or not I would suggest that physical violence would be the ~~only~~ most likely response to a white person shouting ""Nigger"" at people on Brixton High Street.

That *is* how it *is*.

In the same way, shouting ""Chink"" at a Chinese person might well in all likelihood end up in physical violence ...

 .. However if you want to tell yourself that's *not* how it is, you just carry on, **but** be prepared to be surprised if you go through life adopting the philosophy you can say anything you want and there will be no consequences. 

Deliberately choosing to ignore the warning that a term is racist with the ""justification"" of ""I don't think it is"", seems to be heading for trouble (IMO of course)...

In the same way as if someone sets fire to their hair, then beats it out with a hammer, would be pushing their luck expecting sympathy for their headache; I'd suggest anyone who insists on using the term ""Chinky"" (even though they personally don't think it is in and of itself racist) is sooner or later going to get thumped (and hard) by someone who is upset at their use of what *is* a racist term, isn't going to garner much sympathy (and many will say they had it coming)

&gt;The Appalachian Mountains were settled in the eighteenth century by settlers from England, Germany, and primarily from the Province of Ulster in northern Ireland. The settlers from Ulster were mainly [Protestants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism) who migrated to Ireland during the [Plantation of Ulster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantation_of_Ulster) in the 17th century from Scotland and northern England. Many further migrated to the American colonies beginning in the 1730s, and in America became known as the [Scotch-Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch-Irish_American).  Scholars argue that the term ""hillbilly"" originated from Scottish dialect. The term ""hill-folk"" referred to people that preferred isolation from the greater society and ""billy"" meant “comrade” or “companion."" It is suggested that “hill-folk” and “billie” were combined when the [Cameronians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameronian) fled to the [Highlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Highlands).

Arguable it would be better to allow people to use the word to mean a Chinese takeaway than saying you can't use the word as it's racist. As over time the word will become less of a racist term directed towards a people; becoming more a descriptive term for a certain food establishment.

The outer walls are cross-lined in heavyweight lining papers under the wall paper whilst the inner wall is uninsulated as a heat sink. The main room is east facing with double-glazing and has a huge amount of solar gain, hence the overheating on sunny days but I can also use air flow through the flat to cool it during the summer and it stays comfortable. When I re-carpeted I bought the highest quality thermal underlay I could find. 

I use a bread maker most days and cook every day and with the computers running that is all the additional heat I need however I also open the windows every morning to let out stale air so I lose heat that way. In the early evening at the moment it can be cool especially if I went out leaving the windows open for hours but I just put on an extra layer. I am sure that at times my home is much colder than others would tolerate but I have always been warm-bloodied and I am currently on medication that raises my body temperature still further.

The actual bedroom is used as a hobby room/ storage. It is so appallingly designed I wouldn't use it otherwise even though it now has many layers of insulation also which makes it tolerable even on the coldest of days.

I think it'd be more appropriate to call them a tabloid dogwhistle party of like-minded sorts- there are certainly plenty of non-bigots in the organisation.

false,seemylolface,lfc12,,"You seem really worked up over this.  Relax man, it's just some discussion and it's in no way indicative of what will actually happen.  My comments are a little sarcastic and cynical because of how unbelievably bad we've been in the transfer window, which has led us to exactly where we're at right now.  Anyway...

The source has 0 credibility as far as I'm concerned.  I don't care what that dude says.  I'm here to talk about the club, and let's look at the problems we currently have and ways to solve it, an idea that comes to the table is getting Origi back early.  Here's why:

1. We desperately need a striker.
2. We have a very limited amount of money to spend in January.
3. Good forwards/attacking players cost a lot of money and are typically the most expensive players a club can buy.

With those conditions, you can't help but think about Origi coming back.  He's nowhere near a proven talent nor a huge goal threat right now, but we can't afford a player like that.  So we could spunk like 15mil on a mediocre player who we won't use much once everyone is fit again, or we could drop an extra £6mil onto Origi to get him early.  Origi has many of the qualities we need in our forwards (pace, creativity, technical ability, work rate) so he'd at least give us a chance to press and play properly from the top down again.

I don't think it's the right call.  I hope we don't do it.  He's not the answer and IMO he's not ready yet.  He'll be far better served by a pre-season with the team and manager to integrate himself better and hit the ground running.  If he comes this winter he'll have to adapt instantly while dealing the absurd pressure we'll undoubtedly place on him as something of our savior, and I think it'll be a disaster.

This is entirely different than Benzema at any point ever because this is something that's actually in the realm of possibility and not some insane ass dream.  

Of course it's all speculation, but that's all we as fans can ever do.  We don't know anything about what goes on inside the club, and we never will.  We take our passion and dedication and present it in the form of wondering what the club will do next (among other things).

By the way, our team was also centred around Hazard last season, and the fact that we're paying him 200k p/w now SHOULD mean we are centring this team around him too. Otherwise whats the point of paying a player that much who isn't the most valuable player on the team? At the end of the day, goals win matches. If your most valuable attacking player isn't scoring or assisting goals as much as his less valuable compatriots, that would not go in line with the whole ""reward upon merit"" philosophy this club has always followed.

And like I said, secondary stats don't mean much since it could be something as simple as a sideways pass to Fabregas who makes the actual effort to loop in a perfect pass to Costa who then has to make an effort to place the ball perfectly in the corner of the net.

So many of them firmly believe in their mind that not a single American would ever start for a Premier club or could ever make the England national team (a national team that was outpaced by the American team just this year, mind you).

John Brooks is a carbon copy of Winston Reid. He has the exact same skill set, the exact same frame, the exact same speed and strength. What Brooks has is maturity issues. He used to be a lock to start at Hertha Berlin, but then made a poor choice and was taken out of the lineup for missing training due to a tattoo's healing process. He's since gotten back into the manager's good graces and has been reinserted into the lineup with great success.

If you can't see the advantage of signing a player like him, well I guess you're just too short sighted. Collins and Tonks are a fine pairing for the time being. Brooks would be an outstanding third choice, and for cheap. The money saved there, on a player who would likely start regularly within 18 months, could be used elsewhere. Like signing Alex Song, for instance.

However these days I don't think he's even doing a particularly good job winning and retaining possession which is sort of the minimum you'd always expect of him. 

He's a flawed player and I could live with that because of how well he did what he excelled at, but when he's not really doing that he just looks lazy and unfit. Bentaleb has more energy, more aggression, more ambitiousness with the ball, better vision, and faster decision making.

I have lived in the NE (Middlesbrough &amp; Hull), NW (Altrincham) the West (Cardiff and Swansea), the SW (Exeter) and the South East (London, Dover and Shepway) and I found throughout the UK, Chink is recognised as a derogatory term used for a Chinese person, and in my experience the use of the word is universal across the UK (it's not use to describe Russians or plant-pots for instance).

I wouldn't mind the idea of specialized jobs for women, in specialized units for them where they can shine at their own thing. Snipers maybe, or something that isn't so strength based. We definitely like to draw blood, so there is a killer instinct. But we're better at less labour intensive and more mind intensive jobs. Infantry is perhaps not our best forte...

That's debatable, I understand how you've came to that conclusion but I'd say a nationalist party would be something more that hates everything that's foreign, UKIP don't dislike things that are foreign, they wish to have control of our country but they don't want to stop all immigration by any means.

&gt;militaristic, 

The definition of militaristic is to have an aggressive military policy, they wish to fund the military and give a lot of benefits to people who are part of the military, this however does not make the party militaristic. 
UKIP are also against foreign interventions.
I'm not the biggest fan of these policies but they certainly aren't militaristic.

&gt;racist,

We've discussed this before, whenever we discuss this you tend to repeat yourself and link the article about Farage and him being tired with Romanians, if you wish to have this discussion, allow me to quote what I said last time as you didn't respond to my points:

""I don't think it was lying, sounded more to me like he is saying he didn't mean to cause offense with it and is making the excuse of being tired, I don't think that's racism however.

UKIP seems to actively go out it's way to stamp racism, they are the only party which prevents people from racist organisations from joining them, if you are or have been a British National Party, National Front, British Freedom Party, British People's Party, English Defence League, Britain First or UK First party member. When proper racism is found in their party, [they are kicked out as soon as possible](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/ukip-member-kicked-out-attending-britain-first-mega-mosque-march-1475692) .

UKIP also has a fair bit of diversity throughout their party, if they are so racist, why would those people join UKIP and campaign for their cause?

UKIP also isn't the only party with some contraversial comments as I'm sure you might agree, other parties have members which have been ex-members of some certain groups, who've said many stupid things or even done stupid things, some parties seem to prefer to cover it up as well.""

&gt;supports big business over the individual

Have you got a source for this?

&gt;will embark on a massive program of prison building, 

I can't see UKIP stating anywhere online that they wish to build more prisons, was it in their disowned 2010 manifesto by any chance?

&gt;uses emotive dog whistles instead of policy,

The policies [listed on their site](http://www.ukip.org/policies_for_people) don't seem to be emotive dog whistling

&gt;has the support of extreme-right wing journalists &amp; titles, 

I've already given a similar point about that in this particular topic, if you switch out the parties for journalists it means the same thing:

""I personally believe it isn't the party that's nasty, it's just the fact that UKIP is getting popular and are the main party which wants to leave the EU and talks about immigration a lot, parties like BNP, EDL, Britain first etc are going to be attracted to it since it is one step towards their goals even if it's not quite as extreme.""

&gt;is in political alliances with openly fascist parties in Europe

Is this about the deal they did with the polish MEP? I'm not particularly happy about that, however that deal was done to secure speaking time and funding in the EU parliament and they couldn't find anybody better at the time, Farage has already distanced himself from the views of that party.

&gt;has the support of ALL the fascist parties in the UK,

Could you give me a source for this? I'm fairly sure that all of those parties don't support UKIP, some do and I respond to that point with what I said already to one of your previous points.

&gt; treats woman as second class citizens,

Is this because of the comment he made on breastfeeding? If so he said that he isn't bothered by it himself but others can tend to find it embarrassing. 

&gt; wants to sell of the NHS,

Debatable again, UKIP as a party certainly do not wish to sell of the NHS although Farage and Nutall have considered the option the party as a whole is against it and as a result, UKIP wish to keep the NHS free, they state on their website: [""UKIP will ensure the NHS is free at the point of delivery and time of need for all UK residents.""](http://www.ukip.org/policies_for_people)

&gt; wants to get rid of the Human rights act  

They wish to remake the Human rights acts to allow citizens which have committed crimes to have their human rights put below those of law abiding citizens.

&gt;and denies climate change.

I know they deny climate change and I don't quite agree with that policy, I do agree that the amount of climate change we are causing as humans is tiny, I think being a little green is good but the countries which need it most would be somewhere like China rather than here as we account for virtually nothing.

&gt;You either do not understand what right-wing is,

What makes you think that?

&gt;or as in the case of Ukip's racism are in complete denial. 

I honestly just disagree that UKIP is racist, if you wish to raise actual political views which you disagree with that's fine, however stating that UKIP is racist helps nobody.

&gt;It is attracting politcal opportunists from the extreme right of the Tory party.

I wouldn't class Carswell or Reckless as extreme right, what makes you think they are?

&gt;For you to come on here and state Ukip is neither racist or right wing is completely and utterly at odds with the evidence. 

I have stated that UKIP isn't racist and I don't see the particular evidence which proves they are racist.

I also stated UKIP wasn't far right, I never said they weren't right wing.

&gt;I suggest you either have a think about what you are saying, or stop lying.

I'm not lying by any means, I've discussed this issue many times and I and many others with different political views agree that UKIP isn't racist, many people may not like their policies but by calling them racist you aren't going along the right lines to have a proper debate.

false,phys1cs,null,null,"Returns on typical pension investments (principally equities) have historically been higher than those on residential property, and most indicators of expected future returns also suggest equities will outperform property in the UK. Globally, the UK in the past 25 years or so has been something of an anomaly, in that is much more usual for house prices to appreciate only at the rate of inflation, that is at zero % in real terms. You might say that as an economically strong, crowded island, we're different and prices can only go up. You might also have said that about Japan in the 1980s.

Property prices in (many parts of) the UK over the past couple of decades have gone up by much more, but arguably the reasons for this no longer exist - the main ones being a massive expansion of credit (mortgages aren't really going to get any cheaper) and continual government initiatives to get people buying more houses and keep prices rising (home ownership is already very high; there's not really much more that can be done by the government without building more houses). 

The best indicator of overall expected future returns on property (avoided/earned rent *plus* capital growth) is probably the present rental yield, which in many places at the moment is very low. If you're somewhere with decent employment prospects and high rental yields (eg. certain parts of the country outside of the South-East), buying may make some sense.

Whether it's better to buy property or equities is rather secondary to the main question though, which is whether it's better to buy a house to live in now or contribute to a pension. Both are long-term commitments, though at least with housing there's the chance that you could free up the capital earlier if you wanted to (though it's not guaranteed if prices fall, and negative equity is worse than waiting for a pension). Other than expected returns, the big difference is in tax treatment - payment for a house are made out of taxed income, while pensions get income tax relief. If you can get that extra 20-40% return on your investment instantly by contributing to a pension (which will then compound over the years), you're in a much better place. Houses also don't get employer contributions.

Remember, a good pension can pay for rent. A house is *not* a pension, whatever people like to think, and may be impossible to sell when the money is required most. Houses are places to live, but for most people they're also a mechanism to engage in highly leveraged *speculation*. Not investment. If you think you're going to be in the same place for a long time and prices aren't too silly, buying a house is fine. If you think you're lucky, it's also fine (hell, plenty of other people have got lucky), just don't imagine prices can only go one way. '[A]ssuming historical growth of ... house prices vs rents continues' (ie. assuming rental yields continue to decline) is impossible. The questions to ask are how long it will continue for, and where (if anywhere) it will happen, because the UK property market does not move in unison.

This is not what I've found. I have found that in *most* of the UK it is, with exceptions. Given the number of Northerners in this thread confirming this, I don't think it should be open to much more question. This has caused me to be a lot more accepting of how others use language, specifically with regards to intent.

&gt;How's it a racist term?
It's used by racists to describe Chinese people EG: ""Fucking Chink""

So to be clear, regardless of dictionary definition, if a word is used by racists, then, the word is racist no matter who uses it? We best stop racists from using words then, otherwise we're going to run out of words we can use without being racist.

Racism is mostly down to social upbringing and it is entirely possible to behave in a racist manner without ever using offensive language. One should distinguish the difference between a word and the meaning behind it.

They only occasionally get Tennant's speech pattern right when attempting his typical sub-clauses and qualifying additional run-ons etc - and in the first couple of issues it often comes across as being more like Smith's style of speech overall. The artwork is ok, generally, but suffers in depicting Tennant well and consistently (as does the Twelfth Doctor comic, where Capaldi actually seems to look frighteningly like George Bush at times).  

Gabby, the companion, clearly has quite a bit of potential, but only a little has been revealed so far, and she is still something of a cypher as yet. The story arc that has just completed gave us an interesting ""letters home"" style of insight to her thoughts. I don't know if this will continue, but I enjoyed it and hope it does - it could make a lot of difference.

The two story arcs that we've had so far haven't really grabbed me, and the first introduced something that SHOULD be a major world-building element in the Whoniverse: [comic issue 1-2 spoilers](#s ""the Pranavores"") , and that would seem likely to affect a great many future stories, but I really rather doubt that it will be referenced again (and it clearly won't be outside these comics), so  I'm a little put off by that. The second was very much better but had a disappointing and rushed conclusion that really failed to deliver, IMHO.

To the best of my knowledge the greens also aren't running throughout the majority of constituencies, whereas UKIP and the major parties are; so it would seem unfair to give them a spot over other regional parties that poll higher and have the same amount of MPs (just like Plaid Cyrum and the SNP).

Over all, looking from a non-partisan perspective, all this fuss the greens are kicking up just comes across at bitterness - which seems to be mainly directed at UKIP. The fact that you mentioned UKIP, just proves this. If you wanted people to take the argument seriously, the crux of your argument should be about democracy and representation, not how you're coming across as now, which is ""UKIP are involved and we're not"". 

The unfortunate truth for the Greens is that  UKIP are more popular now and until they reach the popularity of UKIP and the Lib Dems, it's unlikely they'd get a chance to appear.

I recall Rodgers saying he helps the team control the game and retain possession, and give the players on the pitch a little rest which sounds like quite the benefit for a pressing team. He's a decent tackler and a smart player most of the time.

Personally, I really liked the type of player Allen was at Swansea. Almost like the advanced central midfield role Coutinho plays. He's very good at protecting the ball and using space when dribbling IMO. His vision and through balls are something he hasn't seemed to replicate since joining Liverpool.

All other material, ie Books and Audio Stories etc are also canon as long as they do not clash with the TV Canon, if two books/audio stories clash with each other (but not the TV Canon) then this is where 'head canon' comes into play.

Because you've stated something as fact. Which is contrary to decent sources on the matter. I could say I wasn't trolling, but I imagine that's what a troll would do. You can view my recent comment history on the matter, however.

&gt;Why is ""Nigger"" racist?
Why is ""Kike"" racist?
Are you going to claim they aren't?

I could. Easily (not sure what a kike is mind). To give you a giggle, I will...

Nigger, is used often by people to mean blacks, generally by Americans. At this stage in the nation's history, it could be regarded as a colloquialism. Long since past its use as a slur for a lower type of person. Indeed it is 'owned' by the very victims of historical abuse in question and is thus frequently referred to in popular culture. Thus the term, despite being regarded even in official mediums as disparaging, can no longer accurately be considered as such when in most common usage, it is now meant to mean 'American Blacks'. Of course, it can still be used in a racist context, such as ""Niggers can't work calculators"". However the term in itself, does not automatically connotate racialist meanings - ""Niggers going to visit Walmart tonight"". Of course, its use depending on those which chose to use it and the situation they are in may be unwise and cause offence. But the offence will be nevertheless, wrongly placed.

&gt;If you think language is ""lacklustre"" that's your problem not mine

Equally. If you are determining words are racist, for bizarre reasons, then that is your problem, not mine. But I do try to help.

&gt;do some research to fix your lack of understanding

Trust me. My research on this topic is extensive. It is others understanding of the terms which are erroneous - conflating offence with racism. It may well be offensive to call someone a Chink, especially to the victims themselves. However, it *may* not be racist to do so, very much depending on what their intent and context was.

&gt;Of course if you lack the courage of your conviction, readers would understand, it's easy to ""talk the talk"" (as you clearly do on internet forums) but not so easy to ""walk the walk"".

Srs? C'mon mate, you sound ridiculous. If you can't backup your point without resorting to 'do this so I can witness you getting your head kicked in', you've lost any sense of reason.

But if someone's murdered they don't have to face the humiliation of being dragged through the press and pilloried in the court of public opinion.  Similarly, a victim of robbery can rely on physical evidence to reinforce their case.  A rape victim most often has only their word against their accuser's to rely upon, and commonly a pattern of character assassination is employed to discredit them.  Ironically, and most cruelly of all, many of the symptoms of their trauma (drug abuse, mental illness, criminal history) can exacerbate this and harm their credibility in the public eye to the point where they are as much on trial as the accused.  Particularly where cesspits like reddit's wonderful Men's Rights community or similar repugnant groups become involved.

It sounds to me like Martinez is in the last group, because if he truly had what it takes to be successful in the EPL, he would've been snapped up by Chelsea or City by now.  Even teams like Juve, Monaco or Atletico haven't made a move for him, which makes me wonder if other people are seeing deficiencies in his game that we're not.

Eriksen was a totally different case, and much more common an example of the kinds of players we buy.  Good, young, talented, yet unproven in a really big league.",0,1419036103,null,0,false,0,cn031ze,t3_2ppplk,t1_cn031ze,t1_cmztybw,null,1425309198,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

One, and as stated before, I think the amount of MPs should be irrelevant. But then again, it's not my decision.


&gt; - They are already polling higher than Lib Dems.

If this is the case, then I don't see why they shouldn't be involved. But again, could you provide a source for this?


&gt; - Judging by membership or opinion polls they are the fastest growing party

Sounds like speculation, but you may be right. Again, if you could provide a source for this, I'd appreciate it.


&gt; - 80% of people asked including and PM think they should take part.

I've never been a fan of select opinion polls, it's quite easy to skew figures. But again, I don't disagree with them.


None of this counters the argument that they're not running in the majority of the constituencies. To be a national party, you should honestly have the scope to run in a majority of wards.

Rather, the money you put in (depending on the kind of pension you have) will either give you an income guaranteed by your employer that's related to your length of time in the scheme and your salary, or your money will buy a monthly amount of 'units', the price of which varies day to day and is aimed to increase gradually over time ie, the more units you have, the better, because you hope their price will go up so they're worth more by the time you retire.

My biggest problem is twitter, if you look at every recent 'online controversy' its not a problem with 'the internet' its a problem with twitter. It's an online medium where anyone can go and harass or threaten anyone, or even post child pornography.

Twitter isn't designed to be a moderated service, they can remove accounts and posts if they're flagged but from it's conception it's designed as a service to tweet short messages for anyone to read.

People who keep getting offended by twitter need to realise that the problem is bloody twitter, it's not family friendly, it's not PG, there should be no reasonable expectation that your kids can go on there and have a fun old time.

And I say this as a fan of tech, one of my friends at uni developed for twitter and now works for them, it's a great platform technologically. But just because the technology works doesn't mean it's appropriate for everyone.

This means either, they require an increase in their package of care and that is a being arranged or they are going to a community hospital for rehab (physiotherapy and the like) before going home. Unfortunately community hospital beds are becoming fewer and social care budgets aren't increasing to meet the demand.

If those 12 patients can't be discharged, those 12 beds can't be filled with new admissions and you see long waiting times in A&amp;E.

The only thing that's certain about this election is that at least one of Labour and the Conservatives will form the next government. The Lib Dems are in Government now, and deserve the chance to defend their record. UKIP topped the poll in the European election and has come second or first in every by-election for the past few years - they can't not be included.

The Green party is well below the above standard - they're not in Government, and they're unlikely to be (they say themselves the best they might offer is a confidence and supply arrangement - that's not Government, they're too interested in their own polling to go full coalition - but it's unlikely to come to even C&amp;S). They poll similarly to the Lib Dems - which really isn't saying much and the Lib Dems are in Government anyway. They perform poorly in by-elections and in the European elections their votes and share of the vote actually went down. They really don't have a leg to stand on.

Even the SNP have a better case than the Greens. Before you say they're a regional party - so are the Greens, as the Scottish Greens are a separate entity (in a way that Scottish Labour, for example, isn't).

Now, in my opinion having the debates at all is a bad idea - and is not compatible with our parliamentary system. Even in a two-party parliamentary system they're not great. If we're having debates at all, we need at least the four parties mentioned above, and four is too many. It's not a debate, then, it's a press conference. A debate works best when there are two clearly opposing views, not four people trying to push their own agenda.

Five would just make it worse - and where would you draw the line, what would the condition be? At least one MP? By my count there are ten parties in the House of Commons. Suppose the debate is 90 minutes (I daresay longer and people won't be paying attention), that's 9 minutes speaking time each. Not counting audience speaking or the moderator. It would be difficult to follow and not very informative. Debates decline in quality in proportion to the number of participants after two. So the Greens would need a severely compelling case to be there, like UKIP have. A series of interviews would work better - and the Greens would have every reason to get an interview.

But they shouldn't be in the debates. They really don't have a reason to be there.",0,1419067709,null,0,false,0,cn0dg17,t3_2ps049,t1_cn0dg17,t1_cmzxyxx,null,1425304206,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

If you look at Thornberry's twitter, she's always taking photos of her itinerary - some of them are more scenic, like a [Thames sunset](https://twitter.com/EmilyThornberry/status/518087586745954305) or [Peterborough cathedral](https://twitter.com/EmilyThornberry/status/492252190468481025), but others are of [homes even more ordinary](https://twitter.com/EmilyThornberry/status/534326984961454080) than that she got in trouble for. [This one](https://twitter.com/EmilyThornberry/status/535450360165728256) was taken earlier the same day.

My initial reaction was that she was indeed being snobbish, but having seen those others, I can't sustain that belief.

If Thornberry's response had been that ""it's quintessential of modern England, and it's this kind of sentiment that the Labour party is up against, and a patriotism we need to recapture"" then I think she would have been fine.

false,DefectOrFearture,logo,,"&gt; if an academy player doesn't get the nod and we play a false nine, then that's a pretty damning indication of the quality of the forwards currently in the programme

I agree.... halfway. I think it also reflects the top, top quality of our first team as well. I mean, the academy hasn't caught up to be a feeder for a club with a first team like ours. Very tough to have a youth player come into the forward role for a team our level. Our team is used to having  Kun Aguero up there! We'd have trouble finding a decent replacement on the transfer market, let alone the EDS. 

I think a big part of the decision has to account for familiarity. So, that means either Pozo or like a 4-6-0 formation, and maybe bring on a new player like Ambrose sometime later in the second half. Though Pozo hasn't been fantastic yet, I think I can chalk it up to his youth and unfamiliarity with the league, and the squad as well. It seemed like the team hasn't really trusted Pozo with the ball a lot. But the more they all play together, and the more experience Pozo gets, the better.

Nasri, Lampard, and Yaya can all score from midfield, so it doesn't look like it's necessary to put one of them in the forward role. I feel like Pozo already gives the flexibility for the midfielders to get forward, so I would expect to see him start up top. Jovetic on the bench, and maybe Ambrose on there too. I know MP said Jovetic isn't ready, but I think he was on the bench for the last game, so assuming his condition hasn't deteriorated...

If we didn't play Pozo, I think Silva would work in that position. He might not score the goals, but we'd be asking too much of JM7 to play striker, only because he is highly valuable in midfield. Nasri could also work out instead of Silva, but I like him playing off Silva, instead of Silva playing off Nasri, because I think Nasri is more of a scorer.

I tend to agree with you on Islington/Hackney. I think they are so diverse within themselves that its possible to have multiple reputations. 

I grew up on the other side of Hackney to you, and so the reputation was more from a Leyton/Walthamstow/Stratford perspective - and as you will know, they are hardly glamour spots. However, on the eastern boundary when you come from Dalston/De Beauvoir into Angel, you have one of the nicest looking parts of London. I know Islington well enough to know you're correct about the bottom line, but reputationaly to me its swanky restaurants, politicians, eco-conscious young families, big houses and gardens whereas Hackney is hipsters, squatters, artists living in storage containers in Hackney Wick Industrial estate, young professionals, and (improving) grime.

This UKIP guy - Farage is right and wrong. Theres the real world where people are flippant about derogatory terms and often don't mean what they are saying. This is global - from Australia, to China, Russia, Germany, Sweden, US, Peru, etc etc. I think Nige did the only thing he could do in that he softened the context before cutting him loose and washing his hands. Behind closed doors, I have no doubt that he would be cursing the guy as a degenerate moron.

However, and for me this is key, they were both in politics. If someone isnt smart enough to be self conscious and think that as....

1) an Islington Labour MP, making quasi patronising tweets about white working class attitudes,
2) a UKIP prospect, making racial slurs and homophobic insults

...is not totally unacceptable - then they are a ticking time-bomb waiting to happen. 

They both had to go in my opinion. Not especially because of anything said or done, but because they were both morons - regardless of where they grew up or went to school.

However, it'll be no small thing to educate the voterbase about what's wrong with the current economy (beyond ""it's fooked"") and what they need to ask for to restructure it.

I'm pretty sure that we could start seeing better wealth distribution in this country by attacking the systems that siphon money out of liquid supply and move it out of the financial stream where is can't be accessed. If only the guy who made 20 million a year (and he's still a small fish and not really the problem) spent even 2 million of that money on consumer goods and services in the UK we wouldn't be quite so knee deep in the shit. 

I'm not hugely educated on this, I'll admit. My ideas are probably flawed. However it seems to me that massive sums of money are being taken out of circulation via financial instruments with very low overhead/labour cost and not spent, which just ruins everything.

[A recent report from the ONS] (http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_386531.pdf) stated that in the year ending June 2014 the UK got around 260,000 immigrants net. Of those, 67,000 came from the EU15 and a further 44,000 were from the A8.

That leaves 149,000 that entered from countries where the EU have zero say in whether we turn them away or let them in.

So even if we were free of those nasty ol' EU types and their long lists of restrictions...our immigration from outside the EU is greater than inside.

You talk about picking and choosing and all that but we do that already, we have a five-tier system similar to the star system used by Australia.

So what will happen if or when we leave the EU, hmmm? Do you really think immigration will plummet through the floor? Because if you do, you're kind of a twat, to be honest.

Overcrowding is an issue, I admit, but then the strain on schools is hardly ever mentioned in papers, while the strain on the health system is blamed on an ageing, not expanding, population. 

Not all your arguments are in sync, and even if they were...even if we left the EU and could turn people away, there's no guarantee that we would, because plenty of EU migrants will just apply the same way everyone else does.

However, based on what little I know about Pavoletti (nice pun in the title by the way), he could be the player we've been missing up front.

In fact, he could even be the ideal partner for Antenucci. Granted, we might not even need to be looking if we didn't let Smith go, but Pavoletti has an impressive goal tally as we can see in this article, which might make it all worthwhile. The point I've been building towards is this: we don't have a striker capable of competing in the air. In fact, the entire deal made sense to me when I read that this lad is 6'2.

I mean, Morison can compete in the air, he won a lot of headers against Wolves, but not consistently. He comes unstuck against a solid defence - like he did against Cardiff's man-mountains - and is often either out injured or frozen out anyway. Doukara, bless him, doesn't seem capable of jumping. He's like Enoch Showumni but with better ball control. Worse still, he doesn't seem to have that drive to get into the box and score, which is a factor in why we seem to have too few players in the box to aim for when we're attacking.

So I can see why we'd go for a player like Pavoletti, who has height, an eye for goal, and hopefully (based on him being Italian) also has ball control to make him a complete package.

Twelve definitely is more bitter, more serious more often and angrier. But he has softer sides too, and he also can be very funny! Just more dry and biting.

But I suggest rewatching with the goal of looking for his moments with more heart because I, too, am a huge Matt Smith fan and I was very hesitant to accept a new Doctor. Eleven is ""my Doctor"" and the reason I first fell in love with the show; Twelve is the first regeneration I've watched in real time (not catching up on past episodes) and it took me some time to accept him. But I really have enjoyed this year's episodes and I love Capaldi's Doctor. He's definitely not a Doctor with the childlike joy and delight in even the world's smallest wonders that Eleven had, but he has heart in other ways.

false,risker15,null,null,"Put aside British society's celebrity fetishism, this article does raise a good point : why on earth do politicians never talk about the internal market and its success?

Several answers for me :

* The working class people who have converted to the UKIP church simply don't have the time or interest to inform themselves as to what an internal market is, what powers the EU institutions have and how much money it saves them. No point talking about something they don't know or care about. Sorry if I'm being snobbishly blunt about this electorate, but if it helps I don't blame them : the concept of the EU is incredibly hard to grasp for us all. Mainly because it is incomparable to previous state mechanisms. 

* The ''country gent'' class of people that vote UKIP (that Clarkson is modelled on) are just a xenophobic bunch who either reluctantly voted Tory or just stayed home in previosu elections. Clegg and Miliband aren't targeting this electorate, Cameron won't win them over by arguing for an internal market.

* The EU acts as a brilliant scapegoat for national politicians to shift the blame on to. Cameron can always argue that his attempts to shut down red tape are hindered by complicated EU Directives. One of the paradoxes of EU legislation is that it is a huge bureaucratic mess to try and destroy huge bureaucratic messes across the continent. But at least its 1 huge bureaucratic mess instead of 28.

* Internal market only benefits transnational corporations. Small businesses get cheaper wage labour but I don't see that as a good thing. European consumers are probably better off but their salaries have hardly benefited from the internal market. Farage, in his EU parliament speeches, has always condemned the apostles of internal market fetishism circa early 1990s for their pandering to big businesses. He's a hypocrite being a libertarian and all, but he's right : the Comission's work mainly benefits multinats who want a whole European market.

I don't personally think hunger is a bigger issue now than it was back then. It is just being better addressed. 

What I also think is that in place of a food bank back then was a tight network of people you could rely on. I don't think it's as simple as ""do I think there's a group of people who go hungry rather than work"". I think they are in a very negative state of mind from years of worklessness, where they have basically given up and work is not an option. Worklessness merges into a mental illness after a substantial period of time. It makes you crazy anxious to step over the threshold back into work, and traps you in a hopeless pit of despair. 

The fundamental difference between the Eastern Europeans that come here and the workless British who use food banks is that to an EE not working is not an option, and to the Brit working is not an option. I'm not saying that as a jibe at the feckless scroungers, and I don't think that starving them back into work is the answer. They have become masters of survival without working. I'm not entirely sure how to break the habit and the mental illness aspect of the situation.

I think a good start might be early morning running clubs. Firstly fitness has been shown to improve mental health and confidence more than any drug at the disposal of the NHS. Secondly it will increase motivation and counter the total lack of energy you get when you are unemployed sat around doing next to nothing all day. Thirdly it will get them up and out early on, so no sleeping until midday which really becomes a corrosive habit when you're unemployed. Lastly it could remind them that they are capable of improving their own lives, which you do lose track of. Probably a bit too idealistic, but running is pretty much free and they do have a lot of time so it's worth a try.

I graduated from uni in 2008, just as the financial crisis happened. Previous to this I believed I had done 'everything right'. I'd worked my arse off to get to uni, shunning going out with my mates getting pissed in order to study hard, as I thought that putting the graft in now would help me later. 

I worked several jobs at uni to support myself through my undergrad and masters. Unfortunately, when I finally graduated, due to the markets going into free fall, people were being fired en-masse. I wrote countless applications until I ran out of my savings. At this point I had to swallow my pride and go to the job centre.

I honestly have trouble describing the scene when I went to sign on for the first time. The queues were round the block to get in, it was chaos, when I finally got to the desk hours later the advisor was telling me how there were bank managers coming in, having just been made redundant, applying for receptionist/call centre/manual labour work. When the social strata shifts down by such a degree, what hope have recent grads/non qualified workers got when facing such competition. 

The grind of firing off so many applications, never to get a response, went on and on, chipping away at my self esteem and after a while mental illness set in. I got depressed and agoraphobic from sitting in my room writing applications all day. What little money I had for food was spent on cheapest food possible, own brand supernoodles usually, 7p a pack. No money for heating (and it was a shitty winter in 2008) meant that getting out of bed was a battle, esp when you don't have a job to go to. I'd find myself going to the local library as it was the only place I could go to keep warm. I was very close to suicide after a year of this. On the odd occasion I'd get an interview, at this point it was a joke, as I was clearly not well and people picked up on this. 

Things eventually turned around for me when I asked for help from friends and family, but not everybody has those support networks. There are still so many suffering what I went through with no way out, sinking ever deeper until they feel something has to give. 

I had massive loans to pay from going into so much debt when I was jobless so once working things were not much better financially for a long time. Perhaps that gives a small window on how the poverty trap drags you down and makes it difficult to get out.

Why it matters is because we don't need a 200k p/w player to provide secondary assists (btw there is no way of tracking whether he actually does provide secondary assists and how many per match). We had Malouda doing the same thing in providing secondary assists, but was one of the most frustrating players to watch.

Even so, have you been on a bike going at 30? Slam on the brakes you'll come to a stop in a couple of metres (although you might go some distance over the handlebars).

false,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;we built a tram nobody wanted or needed for the same amount of money it would cost to relocate the sun.

1. Just because we fucked up the trams doesn't mean we don't need them. Like it or not, our public transport system is shit. Our buses aren't the ""best in the world"", far from it! The buses are literally the second slowest form of transport in the city, the slowest being walking. Everyone says that to get from the outskirts to the centre in ""20 minutes"". Am I just unlucky with my buses that whenever I get the bus from my house it always takes forty minutes to travel three or so miles or do people in this city have a problem with their sense of time? And whenever I ask ""What would you do to improve public transport in Edinburgh"" I get the same, fucking answer: more buses and a car park in the city centre. The first won't do shit, more buses won't speed up journeys, and the second would fuck this city over more than the trams and for longer because the only place we can place another car park is underground, which we can't do because of geology, and having people drive into any city centre in massive numbers is a recipe for daily, endless traffic jams that would make the ones caused by the tramworks look like minor incidents But of course, all this doesn't matter in Edinburghland, getting rid of the trams, encouraging people to drive more and shoving more buses on the roads will somehow solve everything from our transport problems to global warming. It did for Los Angeles...oh wait no, LA is a clusterfuck. Oh well!

2. You think the trams were expensive? What the hell do you think they're spending in London? Do you have *any* idea how much Crossrail is? £15bn, for something that will be overrun and not fit for purpose *from day one*. This is the biggest construction project the UK has seen since Eurotunnel and it's going to be a bigger waste of time and money than the trams ever could be. And what's worse? Londoners say they are underfunded on transport. They have the biggest public transport system in Britain with a massive Subway, an S-Bahn, a driverless light metro, the second biggest tram network in the UK (biggest being Manchester) and that's still not enough, they're demanding everything from a new airport (their seventh) to a ""bounceway"", a bouncy pavement meant to speed up walking. All this is happening whilst other cities struggle to open up railway halts or set up express bus services that in reality won't actually work or be fit for demand!

3. Guess what? We'll get over the trams. Nobody outside of Scotland even cares about it, and other cities that went through the same shit (yes, it's happened before) have since recovered, gotten used to trams and now can't see their city without it. I've had someone from Dublin messaging me saying ""the exact same shit happened here, don't worry about it."" But you know the biggest transport disaster in the UK is? It's not the Edinburgh trams Project, it's not HS2, 3 or whatever numbers they're using for other proposals and projects...It's London. Just, fucking, London. Other cities in the UK would *kill* for what London has and they're spending money on shit like the Emirates Air Line, crossrail, a bouncy fucking pavement, fucking water taxis, and now, now, a privately owned bridge garden that will be closed at night and for parties, paid for by tax money and will shut down a tube station with an annual Entry/Exit number bigger than Haymarket!

false,RedEdMilliband,null,null,"Fitness upon entry into the infantry appears to be to [carry 40kg 120 metres](http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/ADSC_Fitness_Selection_Standards.pdf). By the end of training though, I believe the expectation is that a soldier will be able to drag a fallen comrade with their gear off of a battlefield. The reality of this feat of strength is that it is at the upper limit of what a man can achieve after weeks of intense training. So because women have on average 50% of the strength of a man per kg of weight, and are also lower in weight to begin with, it is probably fair to say 99.9% of women will not make it. 

Then what happens when a woman does make it on to the frontlines? We will have spent hundreds of thousands, if not millions, facilitiating women attempting to join who simply can't make it. And when they get out there they need to be facilitated with seperate sleeping quarters, when they will make up far fewer than 1% of infantry positions. And bam... she gets pregnant or injured (women get injured easier) and pulled out of duty any way. The cherry on the cake is that we aren't short of recruits, we don't need women on the frontline. 

As Ashley Merry correctly points out, the PC establishment and feminists therein are not going to accept that such a pitifully low amount of women make it out on to the front lines to fight for equality. The fitness standards for women will be dropped with little to no justification, while those who complain will be ignored. People are really focused on fighting in Afghanistan at the moment, but we could well end up in a far more aggressive and physical conflict in the future. If these women are really as capable as men, and there are enough of them, then why not get enough of them together to form a squad and let them fight on their own? Men and women can't even go head to head in sporting competitions, yet people think they can fight to the death?

Given that fitness standards have already been lowered for women in the army, police force, fire brigade, air force etc. etc. I see no reason that this trend would not continue. The excuse they tend to use is that it's about effort and energy expenditure, rather than actual output. The reality on the ground is that in some cases men are taking on the heavy lifting and physical tasks to cover for women. 


I'm not suggesting all female squads. I'm just putting a thought experiment out there. It is my opinion that an all female squad would be full of problems.

1) [Women already made up only 1% of troops deployed to Afghanistan](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-politics/10645787/Women-get-pregnant-even-in-the-army-get-over-it.html). So there simply wouldn't be enough of them if they need to achieve even higher fitness standards.

2) As the above article points out, women don't stop procreating because they are in the army. The all female troop could have a significant number of women drop out due to pregnancy, whether deliberate or not. I mean what happens if a particularly sticky war comes up? I believe a substantial percentage of all troops, male or female, would play the get out of jail free card if they could. 

3) You are only as fast as your slowest member. Women would cover ground much less efficiently and quickly than an all male squad. They would also carry less gear. There have been many instances in warfare where survival has been down to a squad moving 40 miles with tons of weight in a single day - That's not an explicit part of training outside of the marines, but when it came down to it men made it because they had to. It was at the upper limits of what they as a group could achieve together, and I think a band of women wouldn't be able to match that.

4) Women have higher [injury rates](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10736550). This has already resulted in women in the army being put onto less intensive training schedules. I don't think the enemy is going to pose less of a challenge to a female squad than a male squad. 

5) Outside of the combat effectiveness, if this all female squad died in combat the fall out for the war effort would be disasterous. A wars success comes down to the army, the politicians, and the civilians all pushing together to succeed. Morale would be utterly destroyed if you lost 10 women in a single day. I hate to say it but the value society puts on a woman's life is a lot higher than a man's.

Sorry, i didn't mean to call our species a 'wuss' lmao.  And your right all animals are driven to absorb proteins and carbs in different ways;  My point was realy that we quite far for being *traditional* meat eaters in evolution.  That it is as unusual for our stomachs to process meat as it is for them to process chocolate... I wouldn't go as far as to say its unnatural but certainly without some specific technological advancement (fire, cutlery) we would not eat meat at all.

Interestingly, the last point is not that we necessarily couldn't have eaten meat without those advancements (but as mentioned it would be challenging); Just that without them we likely would not be driven to consume it.  As we could not make the meat look and taste *vegetable*-like enough for it to highjack our biological drive for vegetables (how many people you know would enjoy eating raw meat and gristle strait of a dead animal?).",0,1419089019,null,0,false,0,cn0hqcn,t3_2pkh4q,t1_cn0hqcn,t1_cmznfh9,null,1425302206,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

That's farcically untrue. The number of people using the trams is in excess of what was predicted and, more, it seems to have had a network effect and boosted the number of people taking the bus too. They're already in talks to extend the tram line down to Leith, and it's not even been a year since the opened yet.  

The trams bad reputation comes from the nightmare they had when they were being rolled out, not from them being crap or unused. Once the line is extended out to Leith, it'll actually cover its operating expenses and run at a profit (which is rare for public transport).

""Socially""? I'm not offended by any comments you've made on the subject matter in this thread if that's what you mean?

Whose misadventured piteous overthrows

Do with their death bury their Gaffers' strife.

And the continuance of their parents' rage,

Which, but their cup runs end, nought could remove,

Is now the 90 minutes traffic of our stadium;

I'd also be in favour of government book keeping oversight, if the government has given you a charter, then the government should be deciding how much tax you pay, not your creative accounting. 

Maybe I'm dead wrong again, but I think the fundamental problem of unproductive profits and assets has to be crushed.

false,Miserygut,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;British democracy makes decisions that you don't like so you want to abandon it and have another body make the decisions instead? 

No, I think we should keep both. Parliament has successfully corrupted and undermined the judiciary and the Lords as counterbalances to their madness so having *something* is better than nothing. If our judiciary and 'upper house' acted as effective counters to poor legislation then the case for stepping out of the EU would be stronger. I have no reason to trust the EU to act benevolently on it's own either.

&gt;My point was that proper democracy in a Pan-European framework is even less workable.

It depends on the legislation being passed. There is room for cooperation between nations and the EU is the best way for us to facilitate that at the moment.

&gt;I think this is the key to so much pro-EU thought. Euro-scepticism is seen as the realm of inward looking right wingers so many lefties seem to support it on reflex.

Don't get me wrong, the EU has problems. However we are *still* better off being in the EU than out of it. The UK should fight hard to improve it and get the concessions it deserves, rather than treating it as a rubbish bin in which to hide it's dirty laundry like we saw with the Data Retention Directive that Blair foisted on all of Europe.

The EU is socially and economically liberal. 'Right wingers' you describe tend to be socially conservative but economically liberal. Social conservatism is not compatible with all the desirable parts of globalisation in my opinion, so I find it logically inconsistent to support that position. I can understand that people don't like change but it's better to harness it and guide it rather than resist it.

false,Mynameisaw,yorkshire,West Yorkshire,"&gt;Fitness upon entry into the infantry appears to be to carry 40kg 120 metres[1] . By the end of training though, I believe the expectation is that a soldier will be able to drag a fallen comrade with their gear off of a battlefield. The reality of this feat of strength is that it is at the upper limit of what a man can achieve after weeks of intense training. So because women have on average 50% of the strength of a man per kg of weight, and are also lower in weight to begin with, it is probably fair to say 99.9% of women will not make it.

Eh?

So lets say, 100kg person, 40kg kit. 140kg to drag across a field. Pretty sure I could do that now without any formal training. I certainly know a lot of women who have no issues squatting with 200kg on their shoulders, let alone simply dragging it.

false,Leonichol,cnty-uk,Geordie in exile (Surrey),"&gt;now that we have seen even your choice of dictionary agrees with me that the word 'chinky' is 'Slang: Extremely Disparaging and Offensive.

Your point was that the dictionary said racist;

&gt;every single one of them gives the definition as 'racist slang'

The dictionary does not say racist.

&gt;That sounds a lot like moving the goalposts to me

Please see my comment history on the matter. I've very much stuck to this point throughout.

&gt;I think you're either a troll or a very stupid individual

...well that's lovely. I appreciate you're willing to engage with me on this matter rather than just applying the downvote button wee-nilly, but there isn't any need to attack me personally.

&gt;why else would the word be 'Extremely Disparaging and Offensive.' unless it was racist?

Extremely Disparaging and Offensive is a required subset of a racist term. However something which is Extremely Disparaging and Offensive is not necessarily racist in itself. All it takes is someone to be offended by it. The definition of racist/racism is extremely important here. Lets say I made up the word 'jopper' to refer to Icelanders. Unless that term specifically meant 'Referring to Icelanders as being incapable of thinking correctly' then the term, is not racist. If it was just another word for Icelander. Then, it is just another word for Icelander.

I appreciate, that in most instances people are applying Chink racistly. But I am saying, that doesn't make it always the case and the word in itself while having racist connotations for most, does not for everyone.

Why is Jap considered racist and Brit not? Why is it when rappers use 'nigger' are they considered to not being racist by some? 

&gt;Who but the one particular race it is targeted at does it offend

The PC crowd. Those which get offended on behalf of others. Anyone which takes a deep personal affront to racism and thus is offended at even the slightest hint that something might be that way regardless of accuracy.

&gt;Are you saying it was just a staggering coincidence that Smith used a word that everyone else in this thread says is a racial slur against the people from Asia about an Asian woman?

Not everyone is saying it is a racist word within itself (which is the point I am addressing regardless of Kerry's usage). There are also people here from my home region which understand that the term isn't always used like you believe it is.

And no, I am not saying it is a coincidence. I have made absolutely no reference to Kerry whatsoever before this comment.

&gt;Do you think Smith often uses the word to refer to Caucasians he doesn't like?

I don't think he does. No. But addressing a race with a noun isn't necessarily racist unless it was deliberately intended as such and the word is specifically defined in a racist manner.

&gt;During a debate about Europe at the Foreign Press Association - which was discreetly taped by the hosts - Farage was asked by former Europe minister Denis MacShane what he had received in non-salary expenses and allowances since becoming an MEP in 1999.

&gt;""It is a vast sum,"" Farage said. ""I don't know what the total amount is but - oh lor - it must be pushing £2 million."" Taken aback, MacShane then joked: ""Is it too late to become an MEP?""

&gt;Farage insisted that he had not ""pocketed"" the money but had used the ""very large sum of European taxpayers' money"" to help promote Ukip's message that the UK should get out of the EU.

&gt;No, I'm suggesting we build social housing for everyone who needs it.

One reason that so many people need it is because there are so many new arrivals, with upward pressure on rents. 

&gt;&gt;One obvious reason that underpins the current boom is the rapid increase in population.

&gt;This isn't the case, the current boom has happened in the last 2 years, are you suggesting that before then migration wasn't affecting house prices and only now people are moving to London and increasing house prices?

There are two booms, in house prices and in rents. 

Rents are set by supply (number of boxes) and demand (number of people); where there are more people than boxes, rents rise to uncomfortable levels. 

You are right population is no the only factor, and that house price booms are non-linear and self-feeding. Low interest rates are one precondition -- but there are low interest rates all over the Eurozone, and only house price booms where there is increase in population.  The UK's long house price boom (for much longer than the last 2 years, I assure you) has been underpinned by a steady rise in population, which gives steadily rising demand.  Seeing this, speculators bid them up further. 

A property boom of this size is a social disaster. (Many historical examples -- eg Tokyo in 1989).  Young people can't buy.  Those who do buy, pay an excessive price: those who own may borrow using their property as collateral.  If prices then fall, these people are left with a debt overhang.
There is nothing good about this.

&gt;&gt;with irreversible social effects
&gt;That's not unique to immigration policy, nor is it a bad thing (I certainly don't think so but I'd like to hear your input)

As a percentage of population, there's been more immigration of the last 2 or 3 decades than in the previous thousand years. 

Is this socially and culturally a good thing? Is it enriching? 
Depends on the migrants :)   
Europe is a cultural bloc (strange yet true). People from Romania to Portugal, from Sicily to Finland, share a lot of basic cultural assumptions. 
The Poles who came here during and after WWII famously became more British than the British in less than one generation.  Who could object to this? 

For EU migration, it's a question of numbers. From a pan-European point of view, mass immigration to the UK is 
   a) not good regional policy (imagine if the EU was a single nation-state: there would be huge political pressure to correct the imbalance of so many people moving to a few places...) 
   b) immigration within the EU is a safety valve for relieving political pressure for reform in the catastrophically mis-managed depressed parts of the Eurozone. 

There are some other immigrant groups who tend to self-identify as part of their own xxxx-british community.  They probably don't feel well represented by the current political system (see the Respect movement), and these communities are likely to identify as being separate groups for generations to come.  Does this matter? To see how it might, take a look at politics in the USA.  It is complicated by negotiation between different ethnic ""identity groups"", and increasingly bitter and polarised. 
     Inequality is a huge problem now, and it has been in Britain in the past. The UK 'solved' this repeatedly by the rich making just enough concessions to the poor to keep things muddling along. This political negotiation is tricky enough when the rich and the poor are from the same self-identified nation, and cultural group, with ties of language and kinship.  It can be considerably more difficult without the glue of a sense of patriotic identity.  ...and if community relations break down, mutual trust then becomes very hard to restore. 

There seems to be a confusion on the left: the ethical ideal that there should be no racism and that different groups should integrate and live in harmony - a wonderful ideal, backed up by laws that I support - this ethical ideal tends to morph into the policy recommendation that building a multicultural society through mass immigration is a good idea.  Whoa! There's a shift here...

Last game our formation brought out the best in our better players and masked the deficiencies of our worst, and yet we reverted again why? 

On top of that, why not make a fucking sub? There's absolutely no justification for that, it's his job to make subs when necessary, and when we're 2-0 down it's absolutely necessary. It's embarrassing that Southampton were comfortably up and they made a sub before we did. 

And while we're on how Roberto has been fucking off it, if you're going to play a possession game, then players have to be attacking. It's like everyone's just passing but noone will move forward past their traditional position, it just gets passed around until it gets to Lukaku, who's out of form and shut down by the entire Southampton defense. 


Aside from that, as usual Howard and Distin suck and are our weak links, and Baines has sucked too lately. 4 corners in a row and each cross was dreadful, his clearances in the box are mostly dangerous or bad, it's time for garbutt to at least give him a challenge.

There needs to be a large market for new products before manufacturers can cheaply mass-produce them. If one country alone had mandated compact fluorescents, there would either have been none to buy, or those that were available would have been frighteningly expensive.

**2\. Energy saving fridges.**

Same as light bulbs.

**3\. Restricting organophosphates.**

If one country alone had banned these chemicals, dirty industries would simply have moved next door. Local businesses would have lobbied hard (and with good reason) to prevent such a huge competitive disadvantage, so it would be very difficult to get the legislation enacted.

**4\. Animal testing.**

Same as organophosphates.

**5\. Airline compensation scheme.**

If this worked the same way, only on a per country basis, then the proportion of journeys covered would be dramatically smaller.

**6\. Ban on neonicotinoid pesticides.**

Same as organophosphates and animal testing.

**7\. Carcinogens in toys.**

Same as light bulbs and fridges.

**8\. Rules on card fees.**

Another poor game by Fonte though, almost gave away a goal at the end, arrived a bit late into tackles, and his passes were a bit wild. Love the dude, but the yellowcard suspension may be a blessing in disguise for next game. Really not worried though, he'll get through it, and it might be good he's suspended because now Ron doesn't have to drop his captain because of form. I do wonder who'll be captain though. This time last year Schneiderlin would be the shoe-in, but I'd rather see Davo get it as he seems a bit more levelheaded lately. 

Really impressed by Toby and Maya, and I've got no doubt they'll be able to hold the line next game with Fonte out. Long was at his best today, just being a pest, probably deserved a goal. Bertrand, Clyne, JWP, Reed, and Davis all played well too. Reed isn't all there yet, kind of struggled to make his mark on the game, but that's to be expected, and I think he was more than good enough to get some more time. Worries me a bit that when Schneiderlin and Wanyama are out we basically need 3 midfielders to fill their usual 2 places, but that is what it is. They're two of the best DMs in the league and have big shoes to fill. 

Offense isn't 100% clicking yet still, but it's good to see if we put Long and Pelle together without any pure playmakers ala Tadic or wingers ala Mane sometimes we can still score. That was the biggest question mark for me going into this game, but they've done well to dispel it.

Not sure why Distin was covering more left and attacking towards the end because he lost possession every time. In my opinion he's past it. Distin is only just average when he's firm at the back.   
Eto'o was okay but just okay. My biggest complaint with Eto'o is he **never** seems to win the ball in the air. He tries to wait for it to come down to his feet and in the meantime the other team come and get there first.  
It's painful to say because he is my favourite player, but Baines had a bad game. His balls were going nowhere except Southampton's feet. There were a few time he seemed to centrally attack and he got all the way to the box with the ball and I did like that, but overall a bad performance.   
A whole lot of nothing from everyone else really. Howard wasn't great either but neither was his defence.   

For me, the best two players were Barkley and Besic. I still get very frustrated with Barkley's passing but he worked really hard today.

- Gomis is great at everything except scoring

- Fabianski has to be the buy of the season. Immense at times today.

- Shelvey is Shelvey

-  Routledge is impressing me with his dribbling more and more every week

- I doubt Emnes every time he is subbed on and he almost always proves a dynamic threat. 

- Our fullback issue needs to be addressed. When Taylor went down my heart sank.

- Referee had some really baffling decisions. Tackle on Taylor was a red every day of the week for me.

- If we could finish half our clear cut chances we'd score at least 3 a game.

I still think the backline looks a little shaky, especially Fazio against Ings. Fazio is really slow. Davies and Walker looks like a proper pair of backs. Our CMs struggled today, Mason and Bentaleb is not defensively good enough. Mason had a good game offensively though and nearly got himself a goal, but instead got injured :'(. Bentaleb had a very bad game. He is not a DM, so he has to offer some more when we are in possession and he didn't today. Gave the ball away in easy situations and his passing was really bad. He wasn't even pressured much and still gave the ball away. Stambouli had an ok game, everything considered. Though i still think he should offer more defensively. No one of our CMs have that ""destroyer"" look in their eyes. 

Our front 4 finally clicked today. They were good on and off the ball. Kane and Eriksens workrate was immense, considering all the games. Eriksens stamina is underrated. Lamela finally delivered. I thought he played more like Robben today and ran against the left back. He even managed to go on the outside a couple of times. Also a fantastic goal. He seemed to start wider in this game, instead of crowding the middle. Very good game, although he faded a little in the second half. That front four should now get a lot of games together, so they can gel. Kane have shown that he can play the lone striker role, with Eriksen behind him. Think about how few games the actually have gotten together.

Tobes, Long, or Yoshida MOTMs for me. Probably the edge going to Yoshida.

Another poor game by Fonte though, almost gave away a goal at the end, arrived a bit late into tackles, and his passes were a bit wild. Love the dude, but the yellowcard suspension may be a blessing in disguise for next game. Really not worried though, he'll get through it, and it might be good he's suspended because now Ron doesn't have to drop his captain because of form. I do wonder who'll be captain though. This time last year Schneiderlin would be the shoe-in, but I'd rather see Davo get it as he seems a bit more levelheaded lately.

Really impressed by Toby and Maya, and I've got no doubt they'll be able to hold the line next game with Fonte out. Long was at his best today, just being a pest, probably deserved a goal. Bertrand, Clyne, JWP, Reed, and Davis all played well too. Reed isn't all there yet, kind of struggled to make his mark on the game, but that's to be expected, and I think he was more than good enough to get some more time. Worries me a bit that when Schneiderlin and Wanyama are out we basically need 3 midfielders to fill their usual 2 places, but that is what it is. They're two of the best DMs in the league and have big shoes to fill.

Offense isn't 100% clicking yet still, but it's good to see if we put Long and Pelle together without any pure playmakers ala Tadic or wingers ala Mane sometimes we can still score. That was the biggest question mark for me going into this game, but they've done well to dispel it.

All in all, I'm really happy with that. Bring on Palace.

Some of the most exciting games of the season have been played there, 3-2 feels like an average result! So proud of our attitude to come back and win. Great team spirit!

Agree with your point about Hill OP. In different respects, him and Kranjcar are superb at slowing the game down. Kranjcar provides the cool head we need to close the game down (his importance is really understated) while Hill makes himself known with his aggression in battling. It was nice to see him back in the team.

Henry wasn't at his best, but I'll let that slide. I've been really impressed by the way he's worked his way into the team. Not his best performance but certainly not a bad one. Barton was fantastic, he's slowly getting back to his best since his injury. Vargas was unimpressive for me again. He needs to remind us what he's capable of. 

At the back it felt like roles were reversed to day. Onuoha was solid, but Dunne and Caulker were all over the place at times. Berahino almost punished us at the end there. I was shocked to see us go down 2-0 at home. There will come a time when teams will hang onto their leads after going ahead here, we've managed to get the 3 points against Leicester and WBA but maybe next time we won't be so lucky.

&gt; What would be the cheapest way of getting around there?

The bus system is good and cheap. If you are living fairly central then most places you can walk to.

&gt; Can you recommend a good/cheap mobile operator in the UK?

""Three"" has a very good/cheap pay as you go offer at the moment if you are not looking for a contract. Otherwise Giff Gaff also have cheap deals.

&gt; I saw there is a few libraries over there, which one(s) do you prefer?

Jubilee is central and OK. 

&gt; How are the second hand shops over there? Where to find them?

Brighton has hundreds of 2nd hand &amp; charity shops. Snoopers paradise in the North Laine is popular (but overpriced for some things imo). There a charity shops everywhere, but particularly on London Road and Portland Road.

&gt; Can you recommend any good loacal tattoo artist?

I've heard Magnum Opus on Upper North Street is very popular, but I don't speak from experience.


&gt; Will people find it threatening or weird if I walk around wearing a bullet belt? (what a weird question)

I doubt it, people wear what they want here.

&gt; I'm going to be renting a ""extended bungalow that is brightly decorated with a lovely conservatory"". Could someone please explain what a bungalow and a conservatory is?

A Bungalow is usually a house all on one storey/level with no stairs. A Conservatory is a basically a large fancy Glass box to sit in, attached to the side of the house.

An old R reg Lexus driven by Clarkson in this video stopped in half the 70mph distance in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGkKDaYd3Mo#t=134 I'd bet a modern car would stop even quicker. I can stop on my motorbike with ABS in way less distance than that.

Earlier in the video he does it in a ford anglia and gets almost exactly what the highway code says.

I'm not really supportive of all the 20 limits in Bristol because I just don't see it as needed. They aren't really enforced anyway, partly because there isn't really wide public support for them, those that stick to them would have stuck to 30, and it's not like there are loads of pedestrians in the roads.

My point of footpath vs road is that you're far more likely to find a pedestrian in the footpath than you are in the middle of the road. Also, that pedestrian probably isn't expecting anything to be hurtling at him over 20mph.

All I have been trying to do here is point out the hypocrisy in an attempt to make some re-examine their position. If they think over 20 is unsafe, maybe they shouldn't be doing it on a footpath. If they think over 20 is safe, they should be opposed to reducing all the 20 limits to 30.

You're right, all humans can be hypocrites. That doesn't mean I can't point it out to them in an attempt to make them change their minds.

These are the kinds of games that we do need to win to stay up, 3 points in the return fixture would also be great.

I also think that Zamora was fantastic in the game, in terms of being a nuisance. We were also missing Isla at times, his link up with Vargas is a lot better than Neddie's. 

The ref also had a really strange game, he was calling everything at the start and in the first half, than had 20 minutes in the second where he let the game flow. It was weird.

It also meant that Clyne and Bertrand, arguably our greatest attacking assets, had more chances to get forward. On top of that, having two strikers up top in Long and Pelle was much more effective than playing with one striker and Mane and Tadic on the wings. And the midfield can only get stronger once Schniederlin, Wanyama and Cork and available again (although Davis was great today as always).

It could be the case that this formation might be less effective against other teams, but I'm definitely keen to see Koeman try it out again. I just hope he doesn't feel the need to start Mane and Tadic again as soon as they're both available, I think having a rest and coming on as subs for a few games would probably do them good.

Instead we're 15th place, more goals scored than Liverpool, and we've finally reached the 1:1 games:points ratio. 

The referee may have fucked us today but we had our fair share of good fortune. On the balance of the chances, they were arguably slightly better, I thought. Our defending was so bad that those two goals could just as well have been own goals. But when we kicked off at 2-0 down I saw the players hyping each other up and fistpumping in a 'come on' fashion. Even 2-0 down we have the spirit at home to keep fighting. Old QPR would've just given up. 

The Vargas substitution for Hoilett irritated me. Vargas was ineffective in the first half but as the game opened up in the second he started finding space and running at his defender. Then Harry subbed him off, at the worst possible time. Meanwhile Fer wad having a pretty poor game but was allowed to continue for the full 90 minutes. It really should've been Fer for Hoilett imo. That way we would've had the pace threat on both flanks.

Aside from that I'd like to whinge at a few more things, such as the sloppy passes in midfield, and the complete absence of the right winger and defender in the first half. I think it goes to show how essential starting Isla and Vargas together is, since that flank is usually one of our biggest threats, but today both Vargas and Onuoha looked rather clueless. 

Of course I'm delighted with the points but we weren't as good as the scoreline shows. We have Charlie and the Loftus Road x-factor to thank for a lot. If that can get us points against Swansea and Palace, and we can mend some gaps in the squad in January -- someone to share Charlie's goal scoring duties and another right back -- I really, really think we're going to stay up.

Dealers will quite often take a bike in part ex that they don't really want to make a sale. So if the guy had that and wanted one of their more expensive bikes they'd probably give him £400 for it just to make the sale, then sell it on at not that much of a profit (after the time they've done a bit of a service, maybe put an MOT on it and all the rest) they probably just want it off the forecourt more than anything.

That said I would give the bike the once over and if you don't know your onions take an onion looker with you! Honestly the dealers don't really care too much about those bikes so it'll be a case of what you see is what you get. They won't do too much to tart it up or hide any dents and dings, which I'm guessing it will have. 

You can't really go wrong with a CG125 though. They were built for emerging nations where maintenance might be neglected, where repairs might be ..... interesting and so on. They are as a result bullet proof. The earlier models really are much like the cub in this respect, in fact I'd go as far to say that they're more or less designed to be a cub with gears. The downside of the earlier models is the front drum brake in place of a disc brake but honestly that's about it. You don't have to buy that bike, you could hold out for one (and with 125s I doubt very much you'll wait too long before the right one or ones come up) which fits your needs and budget a bit better.

false,layendecker,crest-new,OLD CREST 4EVA,"Very interesting game.

There are some real obvious problems in our side, largely stemming from the system being played. We are attempting to play two central players on the wings, where both are absolutely wasted- but even more so I feel there there is a timidity and fear of taking any sort of risk from our midfield core. 

Last season, when we were at our best we were largely controlling possession, but the likes of McCarthy, Barry, Baines and even Jags were fearless in spraying the ball into space when it emerged. Time and time again over the past few months I have seen players drop into good space on the opposite flank, and not get picked up because we are trying to use 5 passes to bring it over there, no change the pace of the attack and actually exploit positional weakness when it emerges.

Controlling possession is one thing, but it is redundant if we are not exploiting the spaces that happen when we draw players out- and the only way to do this is with more risky diagonals. 


---

As I said in the match thread, I am very concerned with Baines' contributions. He is potentially our only true world class player, and he has been poor. This is partly because our players aren't shipping the ball to him with the regularity we used to when Osman was his right hand man down the middle, but also he doesn't seem as bright when he does. That is not to mention his woeful set pieces. The guy has hardly hit even a decent corner all year, which is embarrassing. 

I honestly think we should try Garbutt out as a first teamer. Even the best players get complacent, and Bainsey has had years as a nailed on player, playing every game when he is fit- I feel that him feeling the cold of the bench for a few games will really spring him into life again. Additionally I feel that Garbutt offers something different. Whilst he doesn't have the polished ability of Baines, he is raw and exciting. He takes risks, he takes people on, and he can actually hit a bloody corner. Putting him in the team will also provide Bainsey with a rest, which might be all he needs to get back to his best. 


---

Kone not coming on is utterly bizarre. None of the front four were really contributing anything positive when we were 1-0, and it was clearly a system that needed altering. Eto'o was a waste of space down the middle, Barkley is too predictable on the left (cut in and run horizontally on the outside of the box until he loses it) and Naismith is a fucking poacher... Why are we playing a poacher as an inside forward/ winger?

I feel we could have actually made something more of the game is we took Eto'o off for Kone and played him on the left, shifted Barkley into the middle, Lukaku on the right (where he has been impressive in spurts) and have Naismith playing his natural role as an advanced forward. 

Whilst this is still somewhat of a mish-mash of players playing away from their true position Kone's energy and hunger on the left may well have been what we needed to open up the 6 inches that Naismith needs to sneak one in. Surely this is better than sitting on his hands and doing nothing... I have not been one to overtly criticize Martinez, but it strongly appeared as though he gave up today, and that is not the Everton way.

There was also a big issue with pace at the back. Coleman looked off it, Baines looked pretty lost and Distin's time as a PL player is finally up. Time and time again we were forcing into a footrace by the Saints, and time and time again it was Jags who was having to bust a guy to keep up with (usually) Long. Whilst McCarthy will plug this somewhat (because of his amazing ability to read the game), getting Stones back will be a huge relief, because Distin simply does not have what it takes physically any longer- and considering he was a defender who relied so much on his blistering pace... It is a career ender for him (sadly).

---

On the positive side, Lukaku is clearly continuing to adapt his game to become more of a complete player, and I feel it is positive. Whilst it is abundantly clear he cannot perform with the three behind him we had today, he is actually starting to be effective in holding the ball up and playing it into space. He has a long way to go, but I can see him getting there. 

Besic was also great again. He looks composed on the ball, even if he is a lunatic off it. He does need to open himself up and not be scared of taking on a tougher pass though. Far too many times he was getting the ball and looking for the easy option. That being said, him and Barry are a pretty poor match, as they are both a very similar style of ball winning player. I feel that McCarthy will be a much more complimenting player, as he tends to pick up those out of possession and intercept, whereas both Barry and Besic are tacklers. When you have two players who look to close down the man in possession, it means that gaps will appear, and if they don't succeed in retrieving the ball, then there will naturally be space in the middle (which we saw often today).

Aside from that, there are few positives we can take away. The simple fact is that we were absolutely battered by a makeshift Saints side. With the players they had out (3 or 4 of their absolute best) and the run of poor form they are on, we should have brushed them aside. They were playing an unproven and inexperienced defensive third, and we got... 4 shots on target- there is no excuse. Do The Saints deserve credit, of course they do- but it is not like they played out of their skins either.

1kWp in the UK will generate 950kWh's over a year (on average, accounting for losses, solar radiation etc). Therefore 45MW will generate 43,700,000kWh's (which is what /u/brubeck said).

Obviously renewables aren't dispatchable. So you can't just match up total generation vs consumption. If we could our energy problems would be solved. 

A 4kWp home system will generate exactly what you need for a year (4,000kWh's) but it can't be stored or match your demand, so has to be exported. If you could store it you'd essentially be able to generate all your home's electricity requirements for a one off payment of £5k. Every house in the UK would have them. 

It makes the example above even worse, because solar panels the size of Devon wouldn't actually power the UK, it would be completely mismatched with demand. If that wasn't the case, we'd have already built that level of solar, just like every home would have solar.
