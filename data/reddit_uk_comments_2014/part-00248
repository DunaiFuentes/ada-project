true,HiSpain,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"&gt;You can control what you want

That's not really how it works. There are limits to what you can reasonably expect to control. This is absolutely one of them, when the UK government dragged its feet on allowing the Muslim community to establish faith schools they set up their own extra curricular establishments. Currently 100,000 children attend [madrassas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrassas) in the UK. These are absolutely unregulated and have had reports of severe physical and sexual abuse as a result. 

Even if this was a credible policy you have a situation in the UK where 1/3 of state schools are faith schools, on top of this another 615,000 children attend private schools. How are you going to change that? You're going to build new schools to replace all of these? Or just seize the property from the old establishments? Even if you do the (highly illegal) latter you're still going to have to replace staff all over the place. 

You're talking about smashing the current setup because it has a few problems. That's not really helpful or likely. Instead we should concentrate our efforts on resolving any problems we have. Force both private and faith schools to have a 20% other faith/scholarship intake, enforce cultural exchange events at faith schools, whatever.

As for Matt Smith I would not say I was skeptical, more I was curious how they would transition from Tennat to someone new while at the same time changing show runners. I was taken by Smith by the end of The Eleventh Hour, and through his run I enjoyed how he played the Doctor. To me he seemed to be trying to lie to himself and those around him. Trying to show the world he was young and happy, but at times showing he was old, angry, tired, and capable extreme action and violence when pushed. Hell people were pissed that Capaldi may have taken a violent action when Smith destroyed an entire legion of Cybermen to prove a point. 

As for Capaldi I like his performance so far, but I think the writing was pretty sub par for chunks of the episode. It just felt like they were trying to hard, and the constant ""Hey, he's old now but you still have to like him because he's the Doctor,"" was getting really old and didn't help me buy into his portrayal of the character I love.

You might be interested in taking a look at the proposed [tidal lagoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3ixgY9LXNY) in Swansea.  Swansea has the second-greatest tidal range in the world, and the project is intended to power the entire city.

You're not wrong about gay marriage.  This is especially true, interestingly, among the working class; the Welsh working class trend towards being significantly liberal (often socialist) rather than conservative, which is quite unique to here.  

I don't know the field too well to comment, but the five universities worth knowing about around South Wales (i.e. near Cardiff and Swansea) are Cardiff University, Swansea University, Cardiff Metropolitan, University of Wales Trinity Saint David and University of South Wales.  I had a quick browse through.

Cardiff University doesn't seem to have anything immediately appropriate.  [This](http://psych.cf.ac.uk/degreeprogrammes/postgraduate/socialsciences.html) is possibly the closest.

Swansea University has an [MSc in abnormal and clinical psychology](http://www.swansea.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/humanandhealthsciences/abnormal-and-clinical-psychology/).

Cardiff Met has an [MSc in health psychology](http://www3.cardiffmet.ac.uk/English/StudyAtUWIC/Courses/Cardiff-School-of-Health-Sciences/Pages/Health-Psychology-MSc.aspx).

Trinity (Swansea campus) has an [MA in counselling practice](http://www.uwtsd.ac.uk/ma-counselling-practice/).

South Wales (a little further out than the others - about 20-30 mins out of Cardiff) has an [MSc in health psychology](http://courses.southwales.ac.uk/courses/300-msc-health-psychology) and another in [clinical and abnormal psychology](http://courses.southwales.ac.uk/courses/836-msc-clinical-and-abnormal-psychology).

I would say to take a look through them, and pick the course content which appeals to you most.  Also check on professional bodies - in a few places the British Psychological Society is mentioned.

true,lemsip,null,null,"If you read the first link, he says that all short journeys cost roughly the same across Europe, they are merely paid for by different people. In some countries, the taxpayer pays for them, in others, the passenger does. In Britain, we've decided it's fairer if the passenger, who is actually the main beneficiary of their journey picks up the tab.

You miss the point of the second link. The author points out that since privatisation passenger numbers have doubled and are at an all time high (after a massive decline under state ownership), so we must be doing something right. He then goes through the alternative factors that could have caused the rise in numbers and none of them fit. 

Driving isn't particularly more expensive, GDP growth has been lower in that time (people with more money to spend travel more), it hasn't been a global phenomenon, there has been some cash injection, but nothing out of the ordinary compared to the days of BR, it hasn't been at the expense of passenger safety (safest trains in history and throughout europe), passenger satisfaction (BR trains were awful) or freight transport. It hasn't all been caused by the success of London either.

TLDR, the author doesn't intend to compare our railways to Europe, but rather demolishes the argument that they would be better under national ownership. Nationalisation saw a massive decline in passenger numbers, privatisation caused a massive increase, so we're doing something right.

true,PowertotheHoof,null,null,"I thought the episode was absolutely terrible. The whole show has devolved into a horrible, disappointing train wreck, and it's got nothing to do with who is playing the Doctor. There are so many plot holes I could make an strainer out of it, and there are so many **basic logic failures** that I'm shaking my head from start to finish through the whole episode. I watched it almost two hours ago now and these are the things I still am just baffled by.

* Why is all of London just... Y'know, not all that bothered about a GIANT LIVE DINOSAUR wandering around for HOURS? I think one of the major problems is how Moffat writes humans reacting *to* things, they never, ever have the right reaction anymore. Humans are no longer humans, they're some comical weird step apart that just shrugs and carries on their day when alien shit starts happening even if it's in Victorian England.

* Why would Strax try and kill himself in the midst of battle when the entirety of his race glorifies death in battle?

* All of a sudden Vestra is no longer nice to whats-her-name, she's rude and mean and treating her like she's just some wife that she kind of likes but seriously looks down on, constantly telling her to shush. The mutual love and respect that was subtle before is gone, and now we've got 'traditional gender roles but the man is a lizard-woman' smashing us in the face with all the sutblety of a brick.

* We all know the Doctor didn't have a watch, which means he stole that guys coat off of him. 

*So, he's cool with stealing a homeless man's coat, but he's not cool with killing a robot monster that he KNOWS has killed hundreds if not thousands of humans to sustain its life- And he also knows that if he kills this robot monster his friends which are currently surrounded by other robots will no longer be being attacked and possibly killed. 

* So the robots can only tell you're not a robot if you're not breathing, and the second you hold your breath they stop trying to attack you, seriously? SERIOUSLY? There's nothing in there that's like 'hey I was attacking this thing, it hasn't suddenly turned robot in the last millisecond'? Also why wouldn't you just hold  your breath and scoot away then breathe then hold your breath again? They're slow as shit! Easily one of the least menacing things ever.

* The doctor and everyone else is berating Clara for only liking him for being pretty, when the Doctor (Matt Smith) was written into a marriage with Riversong; He's basically a married man and yet everyone is acting like Clara thinks they're together. The whole part with her and Vastra was just so painfully Moffat bitching at fangirls the lines were hardly believable at all. **We ALL know that the Doctor is a VERY different person from regeneration to regeneration, and yet everyone is mad at Clara for noticing this fact!**

* Which is not to say that Clara has managed any kind of emotional connection with the audience or any kind of character traits that are even remotely interesting as of yet, many many episodes in. She's about as fascinating as a wet piece of paper, changing and folding to fit Moffat's current needs based on the episode corner he's written himself into.

* All of a sudden we're in a Bugs Bunny cartoon with boinging sound effects now too?? Seriously?

Ugh, the whole thing is terrible. Really terrible. The video editing is sloppy at best, EVERYTHING is a close up now, I think it must cost them money to do anything beyond torso back shots because there were probably five in the whole episode. Even scenes like where she flicks the screwdriver up into his lap, they couldn't *show* us what happened? The rule is show don't tell if you can, that's so basic! It was a poorly edited mess, everything is messy. Characters have little to no direction, they make very little sense and change constantly, and the story was slapdash and poor. Which is all I can say about the show anymore, slapdash and poorly written. I think Capaldi could have been a good Doctor, but there was a very steep decline at the end of Matt Smith's era and the downward trend continues- and it's not just because it was a regeneration episode either. The Smith regeneration (while it had problems) at least had a hell of a lot of charm, which I cannot say for anything in this entire episode.",0,1408919406,null,0,false,0,cjzggts,t3_2ee4u1,t1_cjzggts,t3_2ee4u1,null,1427376284,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

A good example is from the episode *Midnight*. It is revealed that Sky's partner recently left her. She feels burned by it, and is travelling alone. The fact that her partner was a ""she"" is irrelevant. What's relevant is the universally relatable feeling of loneliness that Sky is experiencing. The homosexuality is a footnote, a minor detail about an emotionally affective character.

Jenny and Vastra on the other hand are solely defined by their homosexuality and the social angst of being gay and also a lizard.

Jack is *the* mostly overt bi-sexual character on Doctor Who.  That was pretty much his sole purpose.  Get him on screen with no clothes on, flirting with the boys and girls.  And theres no surprise that RTD would write that, a) I believe he is gay himself and b) he wrote Queer As Folk.  Of course he is going to introduce a bi character and make a big deal of it.

Vastra and Jenny were introduced 2 series ago and it was mentioned in passing that they are lesbians, but it was left at that. It's only this episode that has really driven home that point ... I'll let /u/Gimli_the_White finish off for me

&gt;I didn't feel like it was ""in-your-face-look-we're GAAAAAAYYYYYY"" - I just felt it was two sniping lovers that weren't ashamed of being in love. While I do think there have been numerous cases of characters being gay for the sake of being gay, at the same time there are all kinds of people and all kinds of relationships. As time goes on folks have to get used to the fact this is true no matter what genders are involved.
You could've replaced Vastra with a male and not changed a line of dialog and it would be just fine.

 [**Apalapucia**](https://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Apalapucia): [](#sfw) 

---
&gt;
&gt;By the time the Eleventh Doctor, Amy Pond and Rory Williams landed on Apalapucia, the planet had been infected by an outbreak of Chen-7, a disease swiftly fatal to two-hearted races such as Time Lords and the native Apalapucians.
&gt;The Glasmir Mountains on Apalapucia
&gt;To pass the time, patients of the facility had access to fabulous entertainment facilities: an aquarium, an art gallery with replicas of famous works from other planets, such as the Mona Lisa, a cinema, access to a vast garden with bizarre and beautiful topiary (described by the Interface as a replica of topiary found on a Shill governer's mansion on Shallanna) and portals to the planet's famous 'Glasmir Mountains' and a replica of the 'Rollercoaster Zone' amusement complex on Clom.

I expect some sloppiness as people apply the shorthand of SMS even to devices with keyboards. (FWIW I was using leet-speak on chat systems and Usenet back in 1990. I'm past all that now. It doesn't look kewl  anymore.)

But most of it is just plain illiteracy.  
It turns out that far more people than I ever expected are - _must be_ - barely literate. All the mistakes I was taught to avoid at the age of ten, adults in their thirties and forties are still struggling with: when and when not to use apostrophes, commas, been/being, where/were/we're, there/their/they're, ""would have"" not ""would of"". Semi-colons might as well be alien technology.

Before the internet went mainstream, they might have spent most of their working life almost never having to write anything, at least not for such a large audience; occasional job applications, birthday and Christmas cards, jotting down notes. But for the longer or more important writing they'd ask someone to proofread it, apply the corrections even if they didn't understand them. The final recipient would be none the wiser.

Now they're writing every day and the mistakes are there for all to see.

And they don't even care any more.

&gt;Why is all of London just... Y'know, not all that bothered about a GIANT LIVE DINOSAUR wandering around for HOURS?

I definitely agree that there would have been more pandemonium but I think for the most part it just happened off camera.  Also, I think a lot of people were just too stunned to do anything.

&gt; All of a sudden Vestra is no longer nice to whats-her-name, she's rude and mean and treating her like she's just some wife that she kind of likes but seriously looks down on

I think they just have a different relationship.  They relate through pseudo-disrespect.  My SO and I do it all the time.

&gt;So, he's cool with stealing a homeless man's coat, but he's not cool with killing a robot monster that he KNOWS has killed hundreds if not thousands of humans to sustain its life

Absolutely.  I think they are exploring the darker side of The Doctor and so yes he is willing to steal a man's coat but no he isn't ready to kill unnecessarily yet.  No matter how bad the ""person"" is.

&gt;So the robots can only tell you're not a robot if you're not breathing, and the second you hold your breath they stop trying to attack you, seriously? SERIOUSLY?

Yeah I didn't get that either.

&gt;The Doctor and everyone else is berating Clara for only liking him for being pretty

I think everyone in the episode was a bit confused and unsure what to do because of the regeneration.  Not just the Doctor.  Everyone reacted differently and I think in the case of Madam Vastra that came across as meanness.  I agree she was a bit of a jerk about it.

&gt;She's about as fascinating as a wet piece of paper

I agreed up until this episode.  I found Clara boring as hell.  However I think they developed her nicely in Deep Breath.  She had a temper and she was unsure.  Not just some perfect friend to The Doctor.

I really don't know enough to argue with the video editing side of your critique but I didn't have a problem with it myself.  I thought they avoided showing him getting hit in the bits out of a sense of modesty but I could be wrong.

I'm maybe more than a little biased I know.  No matter what I was probably always going to enjoy this episode but I have to admit to a great sense of relief when I saw how great it came out.  I really loved it.  I thought it started a touch shaky but by the end it became one of my favourite episodes.

There is no way he is surprised by the change into Capaldi. He knows that its coming.  He tells Clara that his young face is ""just the reset"" and that ""any moment now, he's a'coming"" and when Clara questions this, he says ""The Doctor.""   He is fully aware that he is about to regenerate.  

Clara is upset because she didn't want the Doctor to change into an old man.  As they say in the episode, she was fooled by the Doctor's appearance of youth.  She naively believed that even if his face changed, he would pop up with a new young face.  I also feel she believed that all that would change would be his face.  

Yes, we don't see Clara and the Doctor exit his time stream, but I think this is usually chalked up to the fact that Matt Smith hurt his leg while filming the episode, so they weren't able to film that part.  Plus, if they showed the exit from the time stream, they couldn't end on the climactic moment that the War Doctor is revealed.  

As for the twelth Doctor being the Valeyard, I just don't see it.  Yes, he is different from the 11th Doctor, but that doesn't mean he is the Valeyard.  I'm willing to think that the Valeyard mention in the Name of the Doctor could just be a throwaway.  

You are entitled to your opinion on the quality of Matt Smith's send off, but there is no evidence to suggest anything other than it was a true farewell.  Matt Smith is gone, it's time to accept it.  I loved him as the Doctor, but it's time to move on.

Clara kept popping up in different incarnations in the doctors life for spoilery reasons but people who looked and had the personality of Clara just kept popping up.

In this episode people kept getting turned into Daleks for reasons I just don't rememeber.

When you see Clara you're seeing her deluded perception of what's going on. That he's trapped in this room with access to a delek computer system when in reality she is a dalek in a dalek tank and has access to a dalek computer system.

She sounds human because they aren't hearing her actual Daleky voice, they don't hear that until later. Through whatever way she comunicates to the computer and then the speaker system She is projecting her impression of her voice, maybe she comunicates with it though a mind link or something.

There is no way he is surprised by the change into Capaldi. He knows that its coming. He tells Clara that his young face is ""just the reset"" and that ""any moment now, he's a'coming"" and when Clara questions this, he says ""The Doctor."" He is fully aware that he is about to regenerate.
Clara is upset because she didn't want the Doctor to change into an old man. As they say in the episode, she was fooled by the Doctor's appearance of youth. She naively believed that even if his face changed, he would pop up with a new young face. I also feel she believed that all that would change would be his face.
Yes, we don't see Clara and the Doctor exit his time stream, but I think this is usually chalked up to the fact that Matt Smith hurt his leg while filming the episode, so they weren't able to film that part. Plus, if they showed the exit from the time stream, they couldn't end on the climactic moment that the War Doctor is revealed.
As for the twelth Doctor being the Valeyard, I just don't see it. Yes, he is different from the 11th Doctor, but that doesn't mean he is the Valeyard. I'm willing to think that the Valeyard mention in the Name of the Doctor could just be a throwaway.

true,PowertotheHoof,null,null,"While I can see people being stunned, we were shown two shots of groups of people reacting to the dinosaur; one was people in shock, which I get, but the second one was more what bothered me. People were milling about, going to work, telling their spouses not to get into too much trouble, and lighting the streetlamps. It looked like business as usual. To me this is a fundamental break because we as the audience are supposed to relate to the human population; if you have a shoddy foundation and people don't react the way humans would, the whole show is thrown off. Everyone was pretty blase about a dinosaur that is bigger than Big Ben just standing around for a few hours. It didn't even seem to make the paper the next day! (While I'm sure theoretically it could have been in there, it was a massively missed opportunity for then to showcase London's reaction to 'GIANT DINOSAUR IN CITY' when Clara was doing all that newspaper mucking about. They didn't include it as a show, ergo I can't just give them the benefit of the doubt and assume other than what I was shown as a viewer)

I TOTALLY get relationships that are pseudo disrespect, and they HAVE sassed each other in the past, and it was adorable back then. But (Jenna? I can't remember her name) didn't sass Vestra in the least, and Vestra wasn't sassing, she was a mix of scolding and dismissing. There's a huge difference, and the writing really was just mean.

I suppose I'm a little frustrated because between Moffat yelling at the fans through the episode and everyone on this subreddit talking about how it's 'Good riddance to fake fans' who are sad to see Matt Smith go, I'm a little bit tired of it. I feel like it's a fake front that's been constructed to deflect all the legitimate criticism the show has been receiving as of late. Just because fans are sad to see Smith go doesn't mean they were only invested in the doctor being young and hot; I'm not sure why anyone would think Matt Smith is hot honestly. He looks terrible compared to Tennant, but he's an amazingly brilliant actor and I loved the character he portrayed. However, Moffat and some other Dr. Who fans who are frustrated by the influx of female fans (Which started because the show was relaunched, not because the Doctor was 'sexy') are using it as a shield in order to ignore legit complaints and plotholes.

While I agree that Clara was more interesting in this episode, you can't just have a character be boring as shit for 10 episodes and then give them a bunch of contradictory personality traits for no reason. Clara has never before been 'egotistical' or even controlling; where is this coming from?? How was she even being controlling or egotistical? I see nothing from the episodes at all about that being a personality trait she has. 

I also don't know why a phone call from the Doctor was necessary; She already had decided that he WAS the doctor when he 'had her back' during the episode. Then she changes her mind (for no reason?) that he's not the same person again and she wants to leave, and they had to write in a reason for her to say; phonecall from old Doctor pleading with her to stay saying the new Doctor is 'scared' and needs her help, despite the fact in the whole episode it showed that she wasn't helpful in the slightest. Seriously, she gets trapped by robots, bickers with him in a rather unfun way, and he thinks she's egotistical and controlling, slips her watch several times (illustrating how this Doctor doesn't need her and doesn't seem to want her around). And then she... Stands there while people sword fight until the end. Ta-da, I guess?

I seriously loved this show before the reboot, I used to watch it with my sisters, we'd rent VHS tapes from the library and walk home with them and I loved it. I loved the reboot too, despite some cheesiness and some flaws, it felt awesome. But the last few seasons have been all over the place, it's like watching a show put together by someone who has ADD and Alzheimers and can't remember a character's motivations from one room to the next. I'm glad that other people can enjoy it but it's very frustrating to no longer be able to love it  = / and then have people claim I was only here for the 'sexy' doctors.",0,1408923939,null,0,false,0,cjzifz7,t3_2ee4u1,t1_cjzifz7,t1_cjzhyx4,null,1427375362,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,ryukk420,null,null,"LMFAO these articles are the dumbest things I've ever read. The first one says.

&gt;The Bechdel Test was developed for FILMS. To pass, a movie must have at least two women in it who talk to each other, about something besides a man. This was applied to each episode the specific companion was in.

&gt;Conversations were allowed to pass if they were not centered around a man but did briefly mention one. This was to allow for a companion to be able to mention the Doctor, for example if someone were asking where they were from they could say “Oh, I came here in a box with a man called the Doctor,” and then carried on. Or also perhaps two women discussing something where they may briefly mention their brother, employer, etc. 

&gt;If the mention of the man was removed from the conversation, the purpose of the conversation would still stand. An episode could also pass if the conversation(s) happened in the presence of/with a man as long as it was still between at least two women who were actually conversing with each other (i.e. more than one or two lines and was clearly directed at each other), and about something besides a man. However, conversations where two women were addressing the Doctor (or another man), and not really talking to or acknowledging each other, were not included. This was to allow for three (or more) way conversations, since the test did not say that a man/men observing/participating in the conversation with two or more women disqualified it. A simple address was not considered as a conversation. The women had to have more than a two line exchange. 


Its a show that is ABOUT THE DOCTOR no sht it's going to mostly resolve  around the doctor (WHO IS MALE) and the bechdel test IS FOR MOVIES. But there is no way they even do this stupid out dated sht anymore. There are movies with just dudes in it and over sexualized females which would make more sense of being sexist than just because the female companions talk to a male or speak about a male. 
&gt;&gt;

  Donna was also a strong female role. That's sexist? Lmfao sure



&gt;The second one is barely even about moffat being sexist.  All it really says is Moffat has female characters who fall in love or want babies and none that don't. One you can't even say there wasn't in Moffat episodes because it was rarely even talked about. And Amy didn't want to fall in love she was already in love. But it's completely rediculous to say that not all women want love.shit both men and women want love. 

&gt;And it also says Moffat said ""There’s this issue you’re not allowed to discuss: that women are needy. Men can go for longer, more happily, without women. That’s the truth. We don’t, as little boys, play at being married—we try to avoid it for as long as possible. Meanwhile women are out there hunting for husbands."" And I wouldn't say that is sexist more just ignorant to the matter because all dudes I have met and know (and dudes they know and so on) can't go long without women and the women can go a longgg time without men and also doesn't account for lesbians and gays lol. I think he's just going by his experiences . 
&gt;&gt;. 

But it's not like he doesn't have strong female roles. And tried to make a lesbian couple that wasn't overly sexualized but people just btch about it .

The third link  just takes things he says and placed them out of context. Like this 
&gt;""Moffat is happy his wife is no longer the size of 'a boat',because her pregnancy was a scary time in his life that left him 'pretty frightened' and 'disgusted.'""
&gt;&gt;
obviously it was a joke a lot of people make jokes about their pregnant wives or friends. And he felt frightened and disgusted because it wasn't how his wife always was . your moods change like crazy when you are pregnant and farting and eating a lot happens. he didn't leave her did he? Nope. 

 All of the things they posted on this was all completely blown out of proportion and totally put of context because a lot of this sht was jokes he was making. the thing about Karen gillan obviously was a joke, people make jokes like that towards friends and people they are trying to be friends with. But since it is a girl(and taken completely out of context) it's sexist.
&gt;&gt;



 And the last link is a Tumblr (which has turned into one of the worst websites ever because it's either really extreme feminazis who don't understand what equal means and blows everything wayyy out of proportion or people making fun of them with satire but you can't tell the difference) brain dead feminazi who think equal rights means ""woman get treated better than anyone"" so it doesn't deserve any Merit. I wonder if you actually fully read these articles or not. I doubt it because if you did you would realize how completely ridiculous all of these are.

Hope you don't feel like you accomplished something with these idiotic articles. Because you didn't.

I can see how the stuff on twitter would be offensive, but as someone watching the show I think it's actually bad to judge someones writing by who they are as a person. Cause there are people who are really... weird, or not good, but they write great things. The author of Enders Game, a great work of literature, the entire premise of which seems to be about co-operation with those that are different, has been very outspokenly anti-gay. I don't like his views, but his stories are brilliant.

Anyway, back to the point, if I remove all the things that he's done that aren't part of the actual shows, there's a lot less.

I think the other things you brought up are good points, Rivers story was... a bit disappointing, although I wouldn't say for the reasons you state. I think she was a great character-- and that was ruined a bit in the pregnancy-silence story arch. But if you forget that one mistake, I think she's still a really great character.

I think that you may be over-analyzing it a bit in some respects. Saying that Amy was a 'damsel in distress' seems a bit silly to me. If you have a show with many episodes, eventually there's going to be a point where the writers want to make an episode where a character is in danger who hasn't been in danger before. They chose amy, and had an episode arch where she was in trouble. I don't think needing outside assistance to get help in a situation makes her a damsel in distress, and I don't really feel that adding a pregnancy to the story reduces her to her reproductive system. There are plenty of companions who didn't get pregnant (this is the first one, at least in new who (so for a lot of people it's their first)) so it's a new and scary and interesting plot development. I certainly didn't see it coming. I think that maybe if they showed half a season of episodes with her craddling her baby bump as they flew to different planets for child formula might be that.

Also, I don't think calling her 'the girl who waited' infantilizes her. Do you think Harry Potter is infantilized cause he's 'the boy who lived'? Probably not. Here's where I think you might be making issues where none exist, because I imagine that if you were making a similar post on harry potter and harry was a girl, you'd say that that was infantilizing said hypothetical female harry.

As far as Adler, for me she maintained a very strong role, a very good foil to Sherlock knowing pretty much everything. Also, at the end I got the feeling that the escape was something they planned together, or even she planned it without him, not sherlock saving her. That's speculation of course, but then again I feel your statment on him being a knight in shining armor is similar, both are plausible but neither has enough evidence to make it 100% confirmable. That's actually something I like about Adlers character (and I must admit, I've never read the books) she's very mysterious, and while you say that sherlock overpowers her, and that her expressing emotions looks like a weakness, I feel more that she was very, very smart, but she slightly underestimated sherlock. Not because she's a woman or emotional, but she just miscalculated. Her feelings for sherlock not being what cause her 'downfall'.

I don't have any knowledge of Adlers sexuality, but a quick search brought me posts debating her sexuality and nothing confirming she's completely gay. One post mentioned she said something else in the episode suggesting she was dominating a man, as well as the women client we saw, and that she might be bi. I cannot confirm this however, and it could be inaccurate hocus-pocus.

Hopefully I managed to get my points across clearly, as I'm a bit tired and sorta typed things as I read without really editing. If anything I said is inflammatory I apologise as that was not the point.

true,ryukk420,null,null,"  My theory about missy 

  It could be the rani which would be freaking awesome. She is like the master. It would be cool if it was the master but they never really had a genderswap regeneration besides the corsair and that could just be a special thing only the corsair has. The rani makes a lot more sense. 

  Someone also posted this .(Idk how the link think works on here or if this link will even work for you but . https://fbcdn-photos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfa1/v/t1.0-0/10620639_569322589857496_1565127694042708838_n.jpg?oh=755d89d44258050a5ee97e4bde891fff&amp;oe=545EB983&amp;__gda__=1416416437_992d909cb09f885f8c9f6527a2e1fdc9 

  And someone seems to think that means it was the master but if it's not just a coincidence with the red nails then missy(the Ravi) could have been the one to grab his ring and could try to bring him back to work together against the doctor

  they always wanted to make the rani a reoccurring character like the master but the show got canceled.

  They could finally bring her back. And it would be great but think about it in Mark of the Rani. The rani hides her TARDIS (disguised as a cabinet) behind a screen, and has managed to link it to,as the doctor says, a Stattenheim remote control,which he describes as ""genius"". It is in this TARDIS that she and the Master get trapped with a gradually growing TYRANNOSAURUS REX embryo. Like the T-rex in deep breath. ITS THE RANI!!! 

&gt;I'm almost 80% sure it's The Rani now. Siobhan Redmond is playing the part of the Rani in an audio drama coming out in December of this year. Can't be a coincidence 

&gt;On June 26, 2014, Redmond was announced as playing a new incarnation of the Rani, a villainous character in the long-running series Doctor Who, originally portrayed on television by Kate O'Mara. In the narrative of the series, characters who belong to race called Time Lords (of which the Rani is one) have the ability to change their appearance and personality in order to extend their life. Redmond's version of the Rani is to be featured in BBC-licensed audio dramas by Big Finish Productions beginning with The Rani Elite, scheduled for release in December 2014.[6]

&gt;with an audio drama with the rani coming out in December it would make sense that missy is the Rani. Because people who only watch new who wouldn't really know who the Rani is so they wait till they explain who missy is and in December they release it so more people will want it since they actually know who the rani is

  What do you guys think?

""it seems as though they're implying the Doctor will become the valeyard!""
Yes in some future if the show runner wishes to follow that story line He will become the Valeyard or fight him once again and prevent himself from becoming this darker version. It is possible since the Doctor has a new set of regenerations that the Valeyard is much farther off in the Doctors future than he was before. It is possible that he may not become him at all since he changed his death on Trenzalore. Moffat has said again and again he will not bring back classic Who foes just for the fun of it. There has to be a juicy story to tell first to warrant a return. Missy may be the Valeyard for all we know that is the point in watching, to wait and see.

""I already think it was strange that they never bothered explaining how Clara and the Doctor escaped his time stream""

The Doctor was able to walk into and out of his own time stream and it is implied he walked in, located Clara, and carried her back out. Not everything can be shown on screen. Some things have to happen off screen because of time constraints on TV. 

 ""It's like he expects it to be over, and then BAM! Capaldi. Like the regeration went wrong. It could be explained away, obviously, but what if that's the ""regeneration gone wrong""? That's why Clara is noticeably upset, and that's why he forgets so much. There was a fault. I think capaldi is actually the valeyard. He's almost the exact opposite of Matt's doctor, and he's so very angry and potentially murderous. I'm all for a darker doctor, but this guy stole a tramps clothes and lied about it.""

He expected it, he held off long enough to tell Clara goodbye. He forgets so much because that is an after effect of regeneration. He is almost always a little swish cheesed after a regeneration. He didn't steal the tramps clothes he traded his watch for it. 
CLARA
You swapped your favourite watch for that coat?? That's maybe not a good deal?
THE DOCTOR
Well, I was in a hurry, there was a terrible smell.

He called Clara because he knew he needed her to help him and did not want to lose her as a companion. He knew that she may have issues when he regenerated. The phone call was also for the children watching and for the fangirls who wouldn't see Capaldi as the Doctor.

true,Darth_Tanion,angel,Weeping Angel,"&gt;While I can see people being stunned, we were shown two shots of groups of people reacting to the dinosaur; one was people in shock, which I get, but the second one was more what bothered me.

Yeah fair enough.  It didn't bother me if I'm being honest but I can't criticize you for being bothered.  It is a little odd.


&gt;But (Jenna? I can't remember her name) didn't sass Vestra in the least

I disagree.  I think when she was complaining about pouring the tea and when she cheered Clara that was her version of Sass.  She does it in a different way to Vastra and Vastra is definitely the more dominant partner but I think they were both in on it.


&gt;I suppose I'm a little frustrated because between Moffat yelling at the fans through the episode and everyone on this subreddit talking about how it's 'Good riddance to fake fans' who are sad to see Matt Smith go

Agree again.  People get too high and mighty about their devotion to Doctor Who.  If you like the show then congrats but don't think it makes you a better person that someone who has legit complaints about it.  I loved Capaldi in this episode but I'm still sad to see Matt Smith go.


&gt;you can't just have a character be boring as shit for 10 episodes and then give them a bunch of contradictory personality traits for no reason.

I agree that Clara shouldn't have been boring to begin with but I don't think that's because she had no personality, I think it was because we didn't get to see any of it.  Those things were always there but they were just never showcased.  Remember she was infatuated with The Doctor.  I've known people who hide things like that very well around people who they were ""into"".


&gt;I also don't know why a phone call from the Doctor was necessary

Seriously my favourite part of the episode.  To me that is what Doctor Who should be.  Twists and things that come about because of time travel.  Very difficult to do but I love it when they plan something well in advance and keep it secret like that.


&gt;She already had decided that he WAS the doctor when he 'had her back' during the episode.

I saw that as a Hail Mary Pass.  She had resolved intellectually that he was the same man but she hadn't really truly accepted it.  If someone had said ""Who is that?"" she might have said ""That's The Doctor"" but she still didn't feel as close to him as she did before.


&gt; despite the fact in the whole episode it showed that she wasn't helpful in the slightest.

Tennant's Doctor established that he needed a companion or he goes off the rails.  I think this is the kind of help he was talking about.  Smith was scared because he didn't know what kind of person he was going to become and he know that Capaldi wouldn't either.  He called Clara because he guessed she might run out on him and knew he needed someone to stay with him or else who knows what might have happened.  She didn't do anything amazingly useful in this episode but she keeps him ""good"" for want of a better word.  She gives him someone to care about and to be responsible for.


&gt;it's very frustrating to no longer be able to love it

My theory about missy

It could be the rani which would be freaking awesome. She is like the master. It would be cool if it was the master but they never really had a genderswap regeneration besides the corsair and that could just be a special thing only the corsair has. 

The rani makes a lot more sense.
Someone also posted this .(Idk how the link think works on here or if this link will even work for you but . https://fbcdn-photos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfa1/v/t1.0-0/10620639_569322589857496_1565127694042708838_n.jpg?oh=755d89d44258050a5ee97e4bde891fff&amp;oe=545EB983&amp;__gda__=1416416437_992d909cb09f885f8c9f6527a2e1fdc9
And someone seems to think that means it was the master but if it's not just a coincidence with the red nails then missy(the Ravi) could have been the one to grab his ring and could try to bring him back to work together against the doctor

they always wanted to make the rani a reoccurring character like the master but the show got canceled.
They could finally bring her back. And it would be great but think about it in Mark of the Ravi. The rani hides her TARDIS (disguised as a cabinet) behind a screen, and has managed to link it to,as the doctor says, a Stattenheim remote control,which he describes as ""genius"". It is in this TARDIS that she and the Master get trapped with a gradually growing TYRANNOSAURUS REX embryo. Like the T-rex in deep breath. ITS THE RANI!!!

&gt;I'm almost 80% sure it's The Rani now. Siobhan Redmond is playing the part of the Rani in an audio drama coming out in December of this year. Can't be a coincidence

&gt;On June 26, 2014, Redmond was announced as playing a new incarnation of the Rani, a villainous character in the long-running series Doctor Who, originally portrayed on television by Kate O'Mara. In the narrative of the series, characters who belong to race called Time Lords (of which the Rani is one) have the ability to change their appearance and personality in order to extend their life. Redmond's version of the Rani is to be featured in BBC-licensed audio dramas by Big Finish Productions beginning with The Rani Elite, scheduled for release in December 2014.[6]

&gt;with an audio drama with the rani coming out in December it would make sense that missy is the Rani. Because people who only watch new who wouldn't really know who the Rani is so they wait till they explain who missy is and in December they release it so more people will want it since they actually know who the rani is.",0,1408927296,null,0,false,0,cjzjw1q,t3_2ee4u1,t1_cjzjw1q,t1_cjzjp3j,null,1427374687,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Read my comment, I'm saying people aren't giving this rating based on the difficulty of the tactics needed to be employed, but the fact that they were and provided a pleasing outcome. We've been asking for exciting attacking football and he provided it exactly how we wanted. You can only beat what's in front of you. Or will you only give Lamela a 6 rating because the players he was beating are slow?

&gt; Any manager will look like a genius if the opposing team puts Richard Dunne along with a geriatric former England captain out to face Ade, Lamela, Eriksen, and Chadli.

Really? Cos I feel like we came unstuck in pretty similar circumstances last season.

The point I'm making is the rating isn't about how hard the challenge was but the manner in which it was met, and for me that's a 10/10 (may have given him 9) for it.

Also, it's not *my* figures, it's figures based on a UK based charity which deals with honour crimes compared to your stats which are based on the inaccurate notion of 100% of honour crimes in the UK involving Muslims. 

You seem to care about proportion and there are far more Muslims (8.2m) in the UK than there are Hindus (2.7m) and Sikhs (420k) so it makes sense that the majority of honour crimes involve Muslims.

I do think it's a problem, but one particular to Asian communities in the UK in which the honour culture exists (polling data backs this up). I don't see this through a Muslim prism.

If you're comparing honour crimes to women killed by their partner it shows a weak understanding of honour crimes as they're not directly comparable.

He doesn't run at full pelt that much, but is constantly jogging around, getting into spaces to make himself a passing option.

I just love that kind of desire and commitment... so many times last season neither Dembele nor Paulinho did anything like this, and so any time our CBs got the ball back, they had very few legitimate passing options out of defence.  That contributed to the pressure we were under, which in turn led to our frequent mistakes at the back.

Well, you can go ahead and do that if you want, but does it really change anything?  The point is that there are a staggering number of honor killings going on when adjusted for population.  

So why focus on Muslims?  Well, because the vast majority of the killings are coming from the UK Muslim population.  If you do the math and it turns out that Sikh women are just as much at risk then let me know and I'll whine about them too.

It seems you want to portray this as an Asian problem instead of something unique to religion.  Does it get Islam (or Sikhism or Hinduism) off the hook?  I don't think so.  At the very least it seems that Islam (and Sikhism and Hinduism) are proving ineffective at protecting women from these killings.  Similarly, it seems that FGM can exist quite happily in Muslim populations without much fuss.  Whatever else Islam is, it doesn't protect women from having their genitals cut off or even killed in the name of 'honor'.  

It reminds me of how the Catholic church seemed to be quite unconcerned about the child abuse occurring in schools they ran.  Did Catholics invent child abuse?  Was the abuse solely confined to Catholic schools?  No and no, but does that mean that these things weren't an issue or that Catholics didn't bear a moral responsibility for what was going on?

But there has been sht Moffat said that could be taken as sexist. But some are meant as an obvious joke towards a friend. things some people joke about all the time with friends but if someone else didn't know they were friends would find it offensive. 

Or one thing he said could be sexist but it really wasn't. ""There’s this issue you’re not allowed to discuss: that women are needy. Men can go for longer, more happily, without women. That’s the truth. We don’t, as little boys, play at being married—we try to avoid it for as long as possible. Meanwhile women are out there hunting for husbands.""
It was him not really knowing how a lot of women act and only go by his experiences  (I doubt he has much experience lol) and people called it sexist.. But it was just more ignorance than anything. Also because it seems like not a lot of people know ignorant doesn't mean stupid it just means lack of knowledge.

But if I were to go by what I've seen or my friends have seen 80% of the women we have ever met ARE really more needy and hunting for husband's. But I haven't seen that men can go longer without a woman.  All the women(that are in relationships) me and my friends have met can go longer than all the dudes(who are in a relationship) me or my friends know. But that's because of sex. 

Women we've met when they aren't in a relationship are looking for a husband (unless they are lesbian)  But aren't craving sex like men are. 

A lot of these feminazi's are just out of control these days. Mostly the ones on Tumblr.  And by out of control I mean everything they see they somehow find it as being sexist . And just go insane.not all are like that.  There are feminists that actually know what equal rights is and what it is to be a feminist then there are feminazis who want more rights and want men to have less. And basically think without men in the world women would be fine. But in all reality neither men or women can live without each other .

I also think he did it because they haven't had an old doctor in New who (well besides John hurt) so since Clara was used to a  younger looking doctor she was wary . And his personality is definitely more ""old"" but there is still the childlike aspect he has so it wasn't just how he looks but how he acted .

 I'm sure they would have brought up how old he looked regardless because it was claras first time really seeing a regeneration and the first time on new who they had an old doctor. companions always act weird after a regeneration but since he was old that happened to be one big problem that they used.

 Other companions was freaked out just because of a new face. Clara knew about regeneration but never was explained what could happen maybe she thought the more regenerations the younger you start to look because it's ""a brand New face"" like how she said ""if it's a new face why is it so wrinkled""  and also because all other companions really had time to get used to how he looks without his personality. Clara didn't he passed out then a lil while later when she wasn't there he took off and was acting more dark when she finds him something she's not use to at all. Shes use to quirky childlike doctor who is nice most of the time. Not a somewhat rude doctor.

And the other companions on new who that saw regeneration  All pretty much acted the same way for the same reason.

So they wanted to change how the companion reacted. Instead of just thinking it's not the same person Clara knew regeneration changed your face .  And she said ""I don't think I know who the doctor is anymore"" because she didn't know personality could also somewhat change with regeneration only the face.

&gt;""The Time of the Doctor"" received generally positive reviews from critics. Dan Martin of [The Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian) praised the episode as ""awfully good"". He wrote that Steven Moffat had ""performed the fourth remix of the show's mythology in a row, tying up strands that date back to the beginning of Matt Smith's run."" He added, ""Perfectly, the rebooting of his regeneration cycle was done simply... Who could have guessed the Doctor's renewed regeneration cycle would be dealt with as simply as his best friend just asking nicely?""  [IGN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN) gave the episode a score of 8.4, ""GREAT"", writing that ""'The Time of the Doctor' was an exemplary exercise in celebrating the departure of a loved one. If you managed to stay dry-eyed during the Doctor's goodbye to Clara (itself a not-entirely-transparent goodbye from Smith to the role he embodied), then you should probably double check your heart's still working,"" also lauding Karen Gillan's ""rather crowd-pleasing, tear-inducing cameo"". While criticizing its ""rapid, almost breathless pace"", they concluded, ""It was a melancholic yet ultimately merry end to one of the show's best Doctors to date.""

Gerrard never missed a pen in 2010, his previous miss came in May 2009 vs WHU

However 23/26 since 2010 is a great record. To be honest though I kind of expect Stevie to allow Mario to take a few pens. Either way we are spoilt!

Ultimately - I believe the Doctor's overall character will be the anti-thesis to Tennant's. The Tenth was very confident, to the point where it made him Time Lord Victorious.

true,Ohmstar,dalek,Dalek,"Like most things, it's just a matter of different people having different opinions. Disliking the direction something you love is taking doesn't make you less of a fan. It just makes you human.

I personally don't care for Moffat and the way he's running the series. Prior to becoming show runner, he wrote some truly terrific episodes. When he was announced as show runner, I remember thinking ""Yeah, that seems like a great choice."" I love Matt Smith as the Doctor (not my favorite, but he's still great), and I love the companions he's had. Typically, my favorite types of stories are the ones that leave little hidden moments that become huge moments later on. But I've never felt that these types of stories are Moffat's strong suit, no matter how hard he tries.

I think he's good at concepts, but not particularly great with execution. He sets things up that get me really excited, and then the resolution ends up being... just unimpressive. I can't even tell you how many times during his run that I've said ""Oh... that's it?"" 

And he relies too heavily on the ""important person from the Doctor's past"" concept. At least twice a season, it seems like someone pops up that the Doctor knows very well and we only ever see for an episode or two. On the one hand, I like seeing things like this. The Doctor is ancient; of course we haven't experienced all of his adventures. It absolutely makes sense that he has history with people we don't know. But it's felt very much like Moffat is relying too heavily on that idea.

And River... I love River, and I just felt like her story just got... lost. There was a lot of focus on her, but it all felt very frivolous to me. Once again, the concept was amazing. The heartbreaking idea of her knowing The Doctor less and less as he gets to know her more and more. But in execution, I felt that the whole thing fell flat. The end of the story with Ponds, to me, felt like a child going ""Ugh, I'm bored with this. Get rid of it,"" without a really satisfying resolution. Clara... I like Jenna Louise Coleman, and I like the character. But her importance to the Doctor just felt very forced to me. I'm actually looking forward to her story arc now that she can just, maybe, be a normal companion. And I thought Smith's final episode was heartbreaking. Not for the reasons it was supposed to be, but because of how disappointing it was. It's easily one of my least favorite episodes of the entire series (classic or modern).

I don't think less of people for liking Moffat. Everyone is entitled to their opinions. Just because I don't like Moffat, that doesn't make me or anyone else (Moffat fans or Moffat haters) less of a fan of the series. Different people like different things.

Personally, I'm ready for Moffat to pass the torch. Capaldi's first episode just reaffirmed that for me.",0,1408933948,null,0,1408966877,0,cjzmu1d,t3_2eh56b,t1_cjzmu1d,t3_2eh56b,null,1427373246,28,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,28

true,LordTekno,null,null,"Wow, first off to the people saying they don't like Moffat means they're not Who fans? Wow.

Let me put it like this, I bought a brand new car this year, and I love the thing. Someone dinged it the other week in the parking lot at the mall. Now I still love my car, but that ding sits there and I notice it and complain about it, but it doesn't stop me from loving my new car.

Moving on, my feeling on Moffat is love/hate. Overall I think he's a wonderful writer but he does have his flaws.

He has a wonderful imagination and comes up with great ideas and characters for his stories. However once he comes up with an idea sometime he struggles with execution. He really does seem to come up short especially when trying to tie together various storyline and transitioning to the next one. I've noticed more then a few times when the story will try to reference something that happened before poorly, or when it needs to be referenced the reference won't happen, or it will be a mere passing mention.

Another thing that irks me is he writes a weak 3rd act. He'll spend all his time either setting up or in the middle of a grand adventure, and when it comes time for the 3rd act, for the pieces to come together and make sense, it usually feels rushed and over in a minute. He's wrapped up episode explanations in a few brief sentences before.

Lastly, there's the timey wimey debate. There used to be a joke that anything that conflicted with cannon from the original series was ok because of the time war and it made stuff timey wimey. I accepted that then, because goodness grief, Doctor Who has been on for 50 years now and a cannon slip here and there was not to be unheard of it the world of television. But now it's like they don't even try sometimes. It feels like they come up with this wonderful scene or event that they want to do, and they have to come up either the weirdest explanation why it happened, not explain it all and leave it at such a point where fans themselves are left debating how it happened.",0,1408934769,null,0,false,0,cjzn74s,t3_2eh56b,t1_cjzn74s,t3_2eh56b,null,1427373074,13,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,13

Is humanity really that fickle, that much less stable than it was in 1966, that we need to be handed things with pre-prepared apology note, just in case someone doesn't like it?

And you said it yourself, Rose was pretty tiffed when the 10th Doctor appeared. An hour of storytelling later, Rose was fine and ready to go on the next adventure. Clara just *gives up* because it's not her ""boyfriend"", and needs a special message from him to be okay. There is no *storytelling* in that. That is a quick-fix, magic spell of a solution, and destroys any additional character growth that could have been written and formed by the characters overcoming that tension, and in a sense sullies The Doctor and Clara's future relationship, because she was willing to give up on him so easily.

''The approach taken by governments and local authorities parties in this regard can be summarised as benign non-intervention, justified under the rubric of 'multiculturalism'. Migrant communities have led their lives pretty much as in their 'home' countries. By so doing, large sections of these communities have in the process 'sleepwalked' into segregation. Mixing with those not from one's 'own' religious-ethnic community has become minimal - to the point where, for perhaps the majority living in religious-ethnic ghettos, it is virtually non-existent.

For starters, she aged at a normal human rate within each regeneration.  By contrast, The Doctor was still a child at the age of 90.

The Time Lords are (or were, and may be again) self-appointed custodians of the universe, respected and feared by worlds who are enlightened enough to be aware of them, who have a natural non-linear perception of time, and in fact sense all dimensionality differently that we experience it (see the Doctor explain it to Rose in the episode of the same name by talking about how he can feel the motion of the Earth.)  

River was just a human woman who could regenerate and kept meeting her lover/husband in almost consistently backwards order mostly because of his travels through time.  (Though sometimes because of her own, whether by being abducted or with a stolen time agent device of her own.)

Oh, and she didn't tell 10 they were married largely because he didn't remember her at that point, though she strongly hinted it to him shortly before she died.

I see problems with episodes and there are episodes I don't like.. But I don't btch and complain and I can still see good things in every episode. 

I notice it but I also ignore it for a few reasons 
 1. as much of a fanatic I am it's still a fictional TV show me letting it really get to me won't solve anything.
2.if I let it bother me even a little Bit it would continue to grow and really annoy me.
3. A lot of people who watched it since the classics were younger at the time and your taste in things change throughout the years because you get old and pretty much get forced to become more mature to get a job and things like that .so I can get why they wouldn't like it because one it is a lil different and two like I said they are older and taste in things change. 

There are a lot more reasons I just don't complain about things well I mean I have complained but it never accomplished everything so I stoped and now I love it even more because I see the good things and the messages it is conveying.

I think it's brilliant that a gay couple are such important and beloved characters and I want to see more of them ASAP! :D

Have these two kickass women who are in love with each other and married and go have some adventures!"". That was brilliant - it plainly showed their affection but it didn't treat it like anything to be gawked at. That's how you normalize gay presence in the media. 

Now, Moffat seems to be treating them as some sort of...well, I don't want to say 'circus attraction' but definitely a gimmick just to draw in more audience. It's like they're fanservice now, rather than actually important characters who happen to be a gay couple.

I mean, it's not a HUGE issue for me - I still love those two and enjoy watching them.

In regards to the to/too conundrum it comes down to remembering manipulation rules and mechanically remembering to apply them. It doesn't come naturally, but like any other skill if you practice it enough it eventually becomes easier, and if you stop it fades away (much like a foreign language, you can pick up the basics after a week or so (enough to order food or find a rail station) just from listening to people but without that constant exposure it will just fade).

true,lak47,lfc87,,"If you have not been reading about him the links our fellow Reds have been posting since the last few days, he was the only one who gave fucks at Milan. His problem was that he wanted to do it all himself, such is his heart and desire. Why he failed was because he was played as a lone striker. He would come deep, try to win the ball

&gt; I don't see how Balotelli would fit into this. it's not in his nature.

It actually is. See the point above. He wanted to do it all on his own. He was supposed to be a lone striker, and he was the one pressing in the middle of the pitch, leaving no one to receive the ball in the box. I'm not saying this, the writers and fans who've watched him play are.

&gt; Also, his temperament is such that he loves/needs to be centre of attention off the pitch as well as on. 

Is there something wrong with that? Is it a funeral or a dressing room and a football team? I wonder how right are ex players that say football had character back in the old days. Today, everyone's supposed to be a gent and behave as if it's the army or something all the time. We lost one player just like that, if you're memory is failing you. 

&gt; I know he can show tremendous generosity to fans and strangers alike, but this is all part of his need for attention, specifically positive attention.

This is a crock of shit. So if he's generous, he gets stick and is doing it for attention? Right, ok. 

&gt; How will he react in a dressing room famous for its banter and piss taking; where it's very ethos hammers home to all that 'there are no prima-donnas at this club'.

You're saying he loves to have fun, and then this point. 

&gt; Brendan and others will work hard on helping the guy settle in and get/keep his head straight. Time and resources that could otherwise be spent developing our younger players who still need support to achieve potential world class standards. As such I think there could be a detrimental effect on others. For example, Sterling is no Carragher; he has had/still has his own personal issues that require attention and nurturing.

We're a fickle lot. When it was Mr. Luis Suarez, we were all behind him. His family etc. Now when it comes to this kid who has way more personal problems and a harder life, we suddenly start weighing our resources. I will wait till the season end. If he scores 20 goals, I will come back and ask you about this point.

&gt; He isn't Suarez, who is and alway has been a team player, albeit a loose cannon. He was always humble off the pitch and in the company of his peers. Just because we 'handled' one flawed genius doesn't mean we are the holy grail of all who have a screw loose; this is a very different screw.

But you know what, Suarez had on pitch issues, issues which cancelled him out of games and put our leagues position in danger. Biting fellow pros not once but thrice...and trying to set your own house on fire, I know which I'd take. 

&gt; This is a signing made out of desperation, not careful consideration.

Partly yes. What does 'not careful consideration' mean? You think we just went and bought him like we buy bread? 3 months, as said by his agent, since when we are in talks. Granted a lot of that may be to do with $$$ but surely the coaching team and Rodgers know what they're getting into.

Dawkins is not writing for a national newspaper which caters to a varied readership.  He's speaking solely for himself to people who have specifically chosen to follow him.

I think there's some truth in the idea that if you don't like a particular columnist then you should mostly just avoid them, but the problem with The Guardian is that all (or the vast majority) of their columnists are singing from the same hymn sheet, pushing the same ideology without challenge.  I'm not particularly interested in the columnists themselves, but I am concerned about the ideology.  It doesn't much matter to me who's expressing it.  I hope I don't become one of those people who goes online to explode at the latest outrageous thing Jessica Valenti said in order for clicks.  (Although, sometimes I worry that I have gone a bit down that route.)

So why read the Guardian at all?  Well, because it's a left of center newspaper that I've read all my life.  I admit that as I've got older I've started to drift more and more away from the ideological left, but I haven't yet found an alternative newspaper which I'm happy with.  Although The Telegraph does carry a lot of good stuff, I think its a bit too right-wing for me.  And the Independent is a shadow of its former self.

Really, I'd like a UK version of the NYT.  Something that's unafraid to be intellectual and although it's slightly left of center, it's usually not too ideological.  But the Guardian has really gone downhill these past few years.  I've always enjoyed reading columnists, but now it's full of identity politics, which just leaves me cold.

(1) His scripts and his arc-plotting have gotten incredibly sloppy.

(2) His use of deus ex machina is egregious, lazy, and ineffective.

(3) He has been reduced to recycling his own ideas (and recycling them poorly).

(4) He has a real problem writing women. He apparently only has two of them: The young waif and the slightly psychotic middle-aged cougar.

(5) He insists on writing episodes that focus on time travel, but is astonishingly bad at writing time travel stories.

To put it another way: The Series 5 finale featured a misguided assassination attempt on the Doctor that resulted in the creation of a broken pocket universe and the Doctor is forced to sacrifice himself in order to reboot the universe, but it turns out he's prepped a loophole and can come back. 

Then the Series 6 finale featured a misguided assassination attempt on the Doctor that resulted in the creation of a broken pocket universe and the Doctor is forced to sacrifice himself in order to reboot the universe, but it turns out he's prepped a loophole that allows him to come back. (Only this time the loophole is actually just a deus ex machina.)

Then the Series 7 finale featured (I can't even make this up) a misguided assassination attempt on the Doctor that resulted in the creation of an apocalyptic alternate reality and Clara is forced to sacrifice herself in order to reboot the universe, but it turns out that there's a loophole that will allow the Doctor to save Clara by sacrificing himself... only he can come back because... well... actually, Moffat didn't even bother trying to provide an explanation.

The last one gets bonus points because the initial ""Doctor is doomed"" scenario is resolved by the deus ex machina of Clara jumping into his timestream at the cost of her own life. But then Clara is saved through the deus ex machina of the Doctor being able to walk into his own timestream to save her. The cost of that deus ex machina is established as ""he'll totally be dead if he does it"" and then he avoids being dead because... deus ex machina.

There wasn't as much meddling with time then, more so seeing that everything turned out as it was meant to whether for the best or the worst.

Pertwee on the other hand was just an experience. Going from nothing but grainy black and white to explosive color, kung-fu fighting, flirty old Three was a ride and a fun one.

There's also Stonebridge City Farm (community farm project that's been going since the 70s, with loads of animals and stuff). Also, if you're a creative type, look up Nottingham Hackspace for regular meetings with lovely, mental people who like to build stuff. If you fancy checking out some sport with a twist, Nottingham had three roller derby teams, all of which have regular bouts that are great entertainment - look up Nottingham Hellfire Harlots, Nottingham Roller Girls and Super Smash Brollers.

http://youtu.be/XZ1kRxgKft4

Personally I think this is the worst intro that they ever had on Doctor Who, and I'm not exaggerating. In the past, the mood in general is that intros typically depicted some expression of what it would be like to travel through time and space. 

Some of the original inttros used kalifoscopic effects. Other intros, like the ones from the 80's, used what I believe were images of space and/or computer models of space that were available at the time. The 9th doctors used CGI to create a wormhole type effect depicting the TARDIS flying through the vortex. I think the intros that showed this will effect were the best because they were both exciting and had the best version of the Doctor Who theme song, etc. etc. 

What makes the 12th Doctors current intro the worst is hes flying through some abstract concept. It's like he's flying through a medieval persons interpretation of what the heavens look like.

Forest privatisation, Issue 1373

----

FOREST HOLIDAYS, the Forestry Commission spin-off company now majority-owned by private equity firm Lloyds Development Capital (LDC), is expanding its holiday cabins into important landscapes and wildlife habitats.
At Fineshade Woods in Northamptonshire, Forest Holidays’ plans for 70 deluxe timber lodges, plus a new road, within the woods have been blasted by local and national wildlife groups as well as by parish councils in the area. Those who live in the tiny number of longstanding cottages nearby fear the arrival of a holiday camp in their midst will ruin their peaceful way of life.

From tents to posh eco-lodges
The site is right next to the Nene Valley nature improvement area (NIA), funded by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and Natural England to improve wildlife habitats. NIA development officer Heather Webb says in a letter to planners that she would have expected better from a Forestry Commission site, including “a better consideration of the site’s strongly ecological context”.

Forest Holidays began life as a collection of campsites run by the publicly-owned Forestry Commission, but was hived off in a public private partnership with the Camping and Caravanning Club (CCC). In 2012, just as Forest Holidays switched from tents to posh eco-lodges, LDC invested in a management buy-out of CCC’s involvement, meaning the former campsites were now 65 percent owned by LDC, 20 percent by the Forestry Commission and 15 percent by the company’s managers (Eye 1353). However, Fineshade was never a campsite, raising questions about how much Forestry Commission land Forest Holidays will be allowed to use.

**‘Substantial harm’**

Forest Holidays is soon expected to submit full plans for another 75 timber lodges, plus a shop, cycle hire base and reception and maintenance buildings, in Houghton Forest, inside the South Downs National Park, which is supposed to offer the highest level of protection for landscape and scenic beauty. Earlier this year, the National Park Authority told the company the proposed development could have “a significant landscape and visual impact” and that an environmental impact assessment must be done. The Campaign to Protect Rural England said: ""This inappropriate and car-dependent development within the forest would cause substantial harm to the woodland’s character and tranquillity.”

Meanwhile Evans Property Group announced last month that it was investing £13m in expansion plans at Forest Holidays sites in the Forest of Dean (another 44 cabins on top of the existing 76) and Sherwood Forest (adding 17 cabins to the 65 already there). Campaign group Hands Off Our Forest, which led the fight against wholesale privatisation of the Forestry Commission, described the expanding exclusive log cabin sites as “gradual back-door privatisation” of the public forests.

**PS:** Conspicuous by its absence from the lists of objectors responding to the planning applications is the Woodland Trust – which receives a £2.50 donation from Forest Holidays for every booking.",0,1408950062,null,0,false,0,cjzsf16,t3_2eie98,t1_cjzsf16,t3_2eie98,null,1427370639,3,false,PrivateEye,t5_2s41e,3

I'd much rather they do what they did with Matt Smith and cast someone totally unknown, or do what they did with John Simm, who up to that point was best known for playing Mr-Nice-Guy Sam Tyler in Life On Mars so it was completely unexpected for him to be playing a total psychopath.

I get that other companions got into trouble, but sometimes I felt like she brought bad things upon herself. One last point on why she's my least favorite companion, is honestly because I don't think she stood a chance to be a favorite with so many other stronger contenders. This is clearly not anyones fault, but I think she's a lot of peoples least favorite companion because all the other ones were just better and had much better storylines and character development. Now I haven't seen her season in awhile so some of these reasons could be based off of faulty memories. I will say I grew to like her towards the end of her time on the show!

true,felixsapiens,null,null,"I watched with my wife and mother in law. I consider myself almost a ""not we"" now; I grew up with the series, watched the reboot with glee, cried with my wife through Rose and Donna Noble, and generally loved it. Drifted off very quickly with Matt Smith and Amy Pond; something never sat right with Matt Smith for me, but more importantly Amy was simply never a believable character in the way that Rose or Donna were. Her one-liners were always too smart, too sassy. I loved her as an actress, I thought she was a great bit of casting at first.... but she didn't take me anywhere, and it suddenly felt like an incredibly poorly scripted show. I also started to get sick of the myth of the Doctor. Every episode seemed to be about him being this universal force, oncoming storms; everybody has heard of him, he had heard of everything and seen everything, etc etc. Too big.

The show became more and more self-referential; I switched off, and delved in only occasionally. Everytime I watched I felt a little more embarrassed and confused. I still love it; but it's a kids show foremost and for me there are better things on TV.

So I sat down to watch Capaldi in the debut episode, really hoping for a new window into the Doctor. Capaldi I respect immensely as an actor, and he simply looks and feels like he is a natural Doctor. But it was really really difficult; if you aren't following every minutiae of the show's recent series, which I haven't done, then what the hell is a female lesbian Silurian and camp-as-a-row-of-pink-tents Sontaran doing traipsing around London, what is their relationship to Jenna Louise Coleman's character, and what the hell was going on?

It seemed that nothing happened for about half an hour, except confusingly self-referential dialogue, where every line was apparently laden with some sort of meaning or wink to a past episode. The whole thing was ridiculous. A complete mess. That random scene with the Sontaran doing a health check on the companion (damn I've forgotten her name already), ridiculous, unfunny, poorly played gag after gag. What the hell?

The one thing that has still not changed since the Eccleston days is Murray Gold's godawful relentlessly terrible music. Eccleston and Tennant and RTD's writing perhaps somehow seemed to withstand that brutal onslaught of cheap an tawdry noise; but it just seems unbearable now. Please, please, someone shut this man up.

We switched off after about half an hour, but I really really am distressed that I can't see a reason to sit down and try again. I would like to have another look at Capaldi, perhaps in a future, more ""stand alone"" episode; just the Doctor solving an interesting adventure somewhere in the universe. That might give me more insight into his Doctor, and give me a chance with the series. I know regeneration episodes are always hard sells, with out-of-their-mind doctors running around and being crazy; but it seemed that even his performance was just lost in this swirling vortex of nonsensical babble.

I don't see how any new viewers could enjoy this. There's nothing to grip onto. My wife fell asleep, my mother in law was bravely soldiering on, and I could tell she desperately wanted it to end. So I did, and put on an episode of that new, very intriguing and brilliantly produced series Outlander. The gals loved that, of course (har har) and so did I.

The worst thing was the feeling that I recognised some of that Doctor Who episode; it reminded me of some of the worst moments of the Colin Baker/Sylvester McCoy era. Utterly camp, self-referential, fan-serving, lacking in real mystery or magic. Combined with a relentless 21st century attention-deficit-disorder mania approach to direction, editing and performance......... it just feels like my beloved Dr Who has jumped the shark, finally.

I don't know when it happened; I've only tuned in and out to the past two seasons, and had mixed reactions.  I loved the contemporary reboot of Doctor Who in 2006; it really brought spectacular new life into the tired and lost love of the past, for new generations. The Doctor was once again a great figure in TV, chased by Daleks, telling spectacular and ridiculous stories. Now it feels like I'm sick of him, the stories are too ridiculous, the spectacle forced, the dialogue relentlessly chirpy and sassy, the Daleks just done to death, the whole thing camp and impenetrable. 

I had the highest hopes for Moffat's reign. I have always loved his writing and humour, from Press Gang and Coupling, through to his Eccleston/Tennant Who episodes, the Sherlock............ maybe I'm just older and more cynical. Maybe I can't watch Breaking Bad from beginning to end and then sit down for some light escapism. I'm glad there is a still a large and passionate audience for Doctor Who, but I just found that unbearable.",0,1408952674,null,0,false,0,cjzsyds,t3_2ee4u1,t1_cjzsyds,t3_2ee4u1,null,1427370388,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

Gerrard is not quick anymore and has not been for a while

Gerrard can now only play DM and if he played further forward he'd be left wide open to people flying past him

I already said that Gerrard has a better passing range

Gerrard can finish true but that's irrelevant because he plays so far back, hence no goals from open play for a year

Lucas adapted his game to pure DM
and became the best one in the league for a good two seasons

For the record I very clearly stated that I don't think Lucas should start ahead of Gerrard just be his back up if you're trying to argue that stevie is better then no one is saying otherwise (that would be ludicrous)

There is a lot of history and success at this club, but of recent times we haven't managed to reach such triumphs of the past. We are undoubtedly getting there though, it wasn't long ago we were a mid table team but we are a regular and stable top 5 team now. Our past 5 finishes have been 4th, 5th, 4th, 5th, 6th.

Not quite the big boys of the league, but (barring last season) no pushovers either. We are a good team with a good young squad who can give the bigger teams a game and take points off them (ignore last season, it was a shambles). 

**Our Current Goal**


Currently we are aiming into breaking into the top 4, which comes with a champions league spot along with its money, glory and European nights we all crave. It is the league every team and player strives to play and win. We did it once and put on an incredible run, and we qualified again 2 seasons later only for Chelsea to finish outside the top 4....yet win the champions league via last seasons qualification, thus taking our spot in next seasons league (CL winners are guaranteed qualification).

**What's Next**


We have one of the biggest season ticket waiting lists in the league and with it, a new 50-60K seater stadium now approved and on the way. It should be here in 3 years and is on the same spot of the current stadium. There will be a period where we have to save and pay off that debt, but it is the next step to throwing our weight up there with the big boys financially and on the field. More money = better players to buy and pay wages for.

I could go on forever but I think you've picked a good team, we're not one for the glory hunters but not quite underdogs either. We're just a good solid team who is on the up with big ambitions.

**Teams We Hate**

- Arsenal (look up the history, also known as The Ass, The Scum or plain old ""Cunts"" will do)
- Chelsea, a club with plastic fans who were nothing until literally billions were pumped into it by the current Russian owner Roman Abramovich
- West Ham, I wouldn't say hate but I didn't want to make another heading. Personally I'm not entirely sure why they hate us more than we hate them, but we humour the rivalry for them...bless them. Prime example, they made T-shirts of the fact they beat us 3 times last season, embarrassment. (as mentioned earlier, last season was a shambles for all involved, better to forget it) 
- Take note how all of the clubs in this list are also London based


**Players We Hate**

- Charlie Adam, thug of a player who intentionally aims to injure players, he has been responsible for over 5 nasty injuries to Spurs players, and had a vendetta out for Gareth Bale because...well Adam is shit and Bale makes a mockery of him on the pitch. Last nasty injury on us happened as recently as last season. 
- Jack Wilshere, overrated Arsenal player, hobbies include cocaine use and smoking",0,1408957290,null,0,1409000156,0,cjzts4v,t3_2ei50q,t1_cjzts4v,t3_2ei50q,null,1427370003,10,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,10

As it is, Rooney will have to move to a less favoured left wing position (where he's not as effective), and Di Maria will have to play wide right even though he was excellent playing behind the strikers last term. 

Don't get me wrong, Di Maria is an excellent player and will possibly be the best one on the MU roster, but for those four all to play they'd sacrificing some efficiency.

*There are perhaps five or six hundred Britons currently out there – overwhelmingly, though not exclusively, young men. If and when there is a real attempt to take on Isil, they may come back in a hurry and in a group. Some of them will present more of a risk than others, but the evidence seems to be that most of the jokers – such as those portrayed in the satirical film Four Lions – have already come home.*

*It is the harder nuts that are staying longer. When they come back, they will need surveillance at the very least, and we must look again at our system of monitoring these people.*

*The Lib Dems will oppose the return of control orders; but even Nick Clegg would surely accept that times have changed. If we have to bring back control orders for some of the more serious risks, we should do so immediately. And unless they come back – and if they continue to give allegiance to a terrorist state – then absolutely we should take away their citizenship.*

*All this will be difficult, but the problem has got worse fast, and it could get worse still. What is the point of having a defence budget if we don’t at least try to prevent the establishment of a terrorist “caliphate” that is profoundly hostile to civilised values?

We've already had the Government calling to be able to ban groups (and lock up their members) without being able to prove they're linked to terrorism - the definition of which we know is broad enough to cover journalists - now Johnson is calling for a guilty until proven innocent approach? This is getting out of hand.

And they want to bring Control Orders back - despite them being struck down by the courts. Great. I'm reminded of some of my favourite judicial quotes:

&gt; It may be said that ""honest people need not fear; that it will never be used against them;... This is an attractive argument, but I would reject it. Once great power is granted, there is a danger of it being abused. Rather than risk such abuse, it is, as I see it, the duty of the courts so to construe the state as to see that it encroaches as little as possible upon the liberties of the people of England. - Lord Denning

&gt; The real threat to the life of the nation, in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values, comes not from terrorism but from [unjust anti-terrorism laws]. That is the true measure of what terrorism may achieve.

Secondly, it sounds like you're pretty new to most aspects of Cambridge and applications to study in the UK. Tbh, you could do worse than just reading through this, the Cambridge undergraduate prospectus:
http://issuu.com/caowebeditor/docs/cambridge_university_undergraduate_prospectus_2014?e=4058792/1572945

A lot of your questions will be answered on their website, specifically this page:
http://www.study.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/apply/
(it looks like many of the 'related links' on the right hand side will be useful to you too)

Other than that, I'll try and answer your questions as best I can, before asking a few of my own...

1) The cover letter you mention is known as a 'Personal Statement', and is essentially where you explain why you're interested in your subject, and why you want to study a degree in it. E.g. I'm doing History, so I talked about the books I'd read in my own time outside of school, some of my reactions to them, and why I thought history was an important subject to study. **Admissions tutors will be looking for someone who is not only bright, but is someone they'd want to teach**. Tbh though, I wouldn't even think of it in terms of trying to make your Personal Statement 'stand out'. Thousands of applications are made to Cambridge every year, admissions tutors have seen just about everything, and trying to make your PS 'whacky' or something is not something I'd recommend. Just try and convey your honest interest in your subject, and explain what you're really interested in.

2) **No.** Cambridge is dedicated to giving places to those students which are most capable, and show the most potential. Full details here http://www.study.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/info/policy.html . I work with the Access Initiative in my college, and we are dedicated to destroying these old stereotypes of the ""old boys' network"". Some groups are still over-represented at Cambridge (private school students, etc), but more than anything else, the biggest cause of that is a lack of applications from elsewhere, ie. **Cambridge lets the best students in out of all those who apply**, but if drastically fewer number from some backgrounds apply, there's nothing Cambridge can do about redressing the imbalance, they will inevitably be underrepresented.

3) I don't know, but if you have British citizenship would you *have* to apply internationally? This is worth some serious research, because fees are *drastically* less if you apply from within the UK, plus may be eligible for a student loan at (despite what many people/newspapers will say) very favourable terms. I can't answer this as I don't know your situation, but it is definitely worth researching.

4) I've tried to begin giving the basic info, though I'll need to ask a few more questions before I really know where you're coming from :) ...

* a) **Do you know about the colleges?** So, when you apply to Cambridge, you don't just apply to Cambridge, you apply to one of its colleges. The university is made up of 31 colleges, a little like Halls of residence, but *much* more independent. The college system is at the heart of Cambridge life, and is one of the most fundamental things to know about the place. Especially if you're an undergraduate, your life will be centred around your college, sleep there, eat there, make most of your friends there and do some of your studying there, so it's an important choice.

* b) **How old are you?** If you are above a certain age (around 25, I think) you would be classified as a mature student, so your application would be processed differently. There are some colleges which are exclusively for Mature Students, whilst most of the other colleges will (I think) have a limited number of places for mature students, if any at all.

* c) **Undergraduate degree or Graduate degree?** You said you were having 'another crack' at university, does that mean you'd be doing an undergraduate degree, or a graduate one? As an undergraduate, I don't know much about graduate applications, so I wouldn't dare offer too much advice on that side, because the system is quite different I believe.

Sorry for the wall of text, I'll be happy to answer any more questions you have or try to point you in the right direction, but really, just reading the prospectus and following that link around the website should answer a lot of your questions. Good luck!

true,Mild111,silence,Silence,"I think this is the problem I have with Matt Smith's attachment to the role. So many times they ""called back"" to the previous Doctors so visually and epic. essentially embedding him into the history of the role. Even the end of the movie about Hartnell...why Smith? It kind of ignores the possibility of other people being ""the future of the franchise""..And the most we got of that kind of visual reference with Tennant or Eccleston were passing references to files, that didn't actually call back to the actors who played the role.

I definitely think that's a factor in getting comfortable with Capaldi. We have yet to see him included in the legacy of the role, if we ever will. And the ""No...Thirteen"" scene in 50th doesn't count...I had so many problems with that scene and the fact that what followed was a visual reference of all the doctors that didn't include him, and then an entire episode leading up to his appearance, where the major plot point was that Smith was supposed to be the last of the regenerations. This is why I was in denial that they would count the meta doctor's hand regeneration. It makes the ""No... Thirteen"" and the ""new cycle of regenerations"" cheaper. Capaldi was known to be a future Doctor. Since it's impossible to know any other future doctors, and include them in that scene, it makes more sense for that to have been a reference to the doctors entire cycle of regenerations....not one whole cycle +1 regeneration, a future doctor can be there because of timey wimey, but the only logic behind not having 26 doctors there, is that beyond the fourth wall we know those roles will not be cast for many years.

I do have faith in Moffat though. I believe we can sense that he has just enough tricks up his sleeve to connect 12's stories to the past adventures we've all loved, and through that, we will find comfort in our new doctor.

true,Shemhazai,null,null,"I absolutely loved Capaldi's performance -- you could just tell he was a sufficiently obsessive fan as to have started his own fan club (with only one other member).

He got nods to many of the other Doctors in his performance while still bringing his own unique take to the character.  For example, his behaviour towards Clara (leaving her, admittedly temporarily) was very Hartnell, his steely-eyed confrontation and ambiguous defenestration of the villain reminded me of McCoy (who has always been my favourite, so SQUEE!) and, on a few occasions, his mannerisms seemed very Troughton-esque.

And that Tardis interior -- I was a happy, happy Whovian!  I suspect we're being ushered into an era of a more manipulative, behind-the-scenes doctor rather than someone who dashes about 'flirting' with all of humanity while wearing a succession of young, handsome faces.  I'm a constant defender of McCoy's performance, as he got awful scripts to begin with but, when his portrayal was allowed to get beyond comedy, he really showed the chessmaster that a two-thousand-year-old superhuman entity could become; his use of allies and enemies alike as pawns in a game he'd already rigged was nothing short of chilling.

While it's too early to tell, I think (and hope!) Capaldi could be charting some of that same dark territory; he's ancient, and just through experience alone will be able to manipulate and understand the motivations of most of the enemies he'll come up against.  Doctor Who was always at its best when the Doctor solved problems using his intelligence and social skills (just look at Genesis/Remembrance of the Daleks!) and I'm very excited at the new direction that this episode looks to be taking us... or should that be old direction?

Plus: Capaldi's eyebrows.  That steely-eyed stare as he (probably) threw the villain of the week to his apparent death is a new direction for New Who -- #10 would have undoubtedly apologised to it afterwards and then stood in the rain looking sad, as was his handsome way.  I also loved Matt Smith's portrayal and was concerned that he'd be a tough act to follow, but I'm fairly sure Capaldi will not disappoint.

Lucas is suffering in people's perception for three main reasons as far as I can see

1. He isn't Steven Gerrard but he needs to be played in a similar manner. Remember that tonking we gave Spurs away last year? Lucas played at the base of the midfield with Allen and Hendo ahead of him and he thrived, much like Gerrard he needs people ahead of him doing the running, what he lacks in Gerrard's passing ability and game control he makes up for in shielding the back four, breaking up the play and covering the fullbacks.

1. Rodgers hasn't used him correctly, can't drop Gerrard so if Lucas plays it's with Gerrard which is a fucking disaster. 

1. His stamina/movement have plummeted since his injury and this means he drops off. He had a good first half against S'hampton but as he grew tired  he couldn't cope and a)dropped too deep beside Gerrard screwing up the formation and b)made tired decisions/actions

If Gerrard gets injured what then? Can hasn't proved he can play as a single DM and is brand new to the league, Allen same but with league experience. Lucas needs to be either A) played in all games Gerrard doesn't (which could be a lot given the amount we have this year and his age or B) be used to conserve Gerrard by coming on for him regularly. 

People need to stop pissing all over him for playing in what I'm certain would be a similar way Stevie would if asked to play further forward.

This goes back to the beginning of the show.  I think a lot of people missed it, but the Doctor *had* come to consider himself Clara's boyfriend\*.  It hurt him tremendously when she couldn't see ""him"" through the early chaos of his regeneration.  It was a very deep wound to his soul.  He can't consider a relationship with her until it heals, until she can see him fully.  Capaldi needed to communicate the Doctor's grief and pain to us when he was lying in bed speaking: ""Can't see me.""  It was a pretty big failure on his part.

Compare it to Tennent's ""Did you see?"" in ""The Family of Blood"", ""I'm always all right"" from ""Forest of the Dead"", ""I've been a father before."" from ""The Doctor's Daughter"" or Eccleston's ""I couldn't... I wasn't... oh Rose they're all dead."" from Dalek.  There have been lots of instances where we have seen the Doctor have his soul wounded or seen him communicate such a wounding to us.  This was the first time I felt like the actor playing the Doctor failed to communicate it to us.

Sorry, but this is all a bit too cringeworthy now.

You're a new fan abroad, you don't know anything about the rivalry or what it was like to support City when we were particularly unsuccessful and United were the strongest side in the country.

So spare me the platitudes.

Thankfully, there are people in this sub who do understand the rivalry and appreciated this thread.

Some didn't, and that's alright.

If it wasn't your thing you could've always just steered clear of it, rather than have a pop (which is spite of what you might say, is precisely what you did).

In all honesty, why should you hate United? They're just another Premier League club to you, in a foreign country, you haven't experienced the rivalry, you don't understand it, and you probably never will.

The only thing we have in common is a support of the same club.

The idea that you hate United is illogical, it's an insincere platitude.

If you were honest, you'd recognise that and then we'd have a mutual understanding on our differing opinions on the topic.

I'm totally transparent and sincere - you're not.

That's the difference.

In all honesty I'd rather not get into these kind of discussions on this sub, because I just find it tiresome. If the topic is strictly football then all's well and good, I can enjoy this sub, but when emotive topics closer to identity and rivalries come up, there's always the crossed wires - our exchange a fine example.

I should've expected it when I posted this thread in fact.

true,IAmNotAmerican,cnty-expat,I don't belong here,"I don't dispute what you have to say but for this one point:

&gt; The author points out that since privatisation passenger numbers have doubled and are at an all time high (after a massive decline under state ownership), so we must be doing something right.

The author provides no evidence but increasing numbers as a sign of success. Without statistics presented on passenger growth, or other factors that could influence train journeys (war, population growth, migration, immigration to name a few) then just passenger growth by itself is not an indicator of anything.

Let me put it another way, there are no competing railway lines. I can't choose between Virgin and South Western for a trip to Glasgow from London. Taken as a whole there is no competition to existing infrastructure - there are no alternative railway tracks. However I can choose which type of car that I want to make a similar journey and which roads.

So if Virgin see passenger numbers go up for South to North journeys - it's not because everyone simply just feels like taking a train for a random journey up North. Rather, another factor will be contributing, such as a large conference happening in Glasgow, or a trend in up and coming firms moving to Glasgow as their city of choice.

Conversely, if Volkswagon see an upward trend in purchases of their Golf range - then they can claim success because people are choosing their cars amongst the competition. There is no - one - car manufacturer that you are forced to buy from. If there was then they might have similar figures as the 1st chart for ""passenger"" numbers (with an unexplained fall from 50's - 90's) - this is not unlike other economic cycles such as house prices - a fall does not reflect lack of desire for house ownership, but lack of affordability or availability.

If anything, chart number 3 - GDP growth might indicate that travelling by railway is the undesirable consequence of a failing economy... but with such little data and plot points we can make pretty much any inference we like from that.",0,1408961456,null,0,false,0,cjzuh2t,t3_2eg793,t1_cjzuh2t,t1_cjzg7t6,null,1427369610,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,Shemhazai,null,null,"I can take your point regarding the arc-heavy nature of the first episode, but I suspect that was in part to ease the transition for viewers who've only seen nu-Who to the Doctor not being a young heart-throb anymore.  The use of familiar characters seemed to be a way to not lose audiences who've only ever seen the Doctor as a young man and/or sex symbol.

Capaldi really did strike me as harking back to aspects of other doctors in his portrayal, particularly #1 and #7, while even little details such as the way he stood (with hands on lapels) were clearly modelled on Hartnell and others.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I can appreciate the validity of your criticisms of this episode -- I personally enjoyed it, but it could certainly be accused of trying to cram in too many familiar comic relief characters so as to hide the fact that the character of the Doctor was undergoing a massive metamorphosis over and above the simple physical change.  I mean, the Doctor is the core of the show -- and for the entirety of the revived series, he's been a young man dashing about with some manner of sexual chemistry constantly threatening to erupt between him and a companion.

There was a calculating nature to the Doctor that has only been briefly glimpsed thus far in Nu-Who, so I'd urge you to give the season another chance -- I think we'll be getting precisely the sort of episodes you want, with just the Doctor solving problems by outwitting and out-maneuvering his opponents (while reversing the polarity of the neutron flow on occasion, naturally!)  Capaldi even put the sexual tension side-plot to bed once and for all with a single comment -- he's done flirting with humans, even with his choice of face, and he certainly isn't anyone's boyfriend.
 
If I'm honest, I think the BBC were somewhat cautious -- after all, this is their flagship program and the idea of recasting the lead character so dramatically probably scared a lot of executives, hence the return of the trio of familiar (and fan-favourite) faces and comic relief -- they were trying to paint with a broad brush so as to ensure people weren't immediately alienated by the huge change to the heart of the show.

I loved nuWho, but classic Who was always my vice of preference -- and I'm honestly hopeful that this season could blend bits of the best of both.  Reports are that we're seeing the last of the arc-heavy format, too. (edit: that's confirmed by Moffat: [He's said it a few times, but here's a linky to one!](http://uk.ign.com/articles/2014/08/20/5-questions-raised-by-season-8-of-doctor-who)

Heh, this probably seems like a remarkably impassioned rant, which seems odd as I agree with most of your criticisms. ;)  I went through a similar phase during the End of Time specials, feeling Who had jumped the shark (ten minutes of farewells in the rain with sad music, time which could have been used for actual *plot*, Rassilon being reduced to a cardboard cut-out villain, the sad misuse of the Master up until his very last scene) -- but if I'd quit watching then, I would've missed one of the best doctors to ever fly the TARDIS.  I agree with many of your criticisms, but would hope they can be explained as a strategic choice to lead the audience gently into a shift in tone towards old-Who.

You were right to point out some of the episode's excesses, certainly --I noticed the same things and ended up flicking between it and a Linux reinstall a few times -- but Capaldi's performance included the best of the McCoy era as well as numerous other homages to the past.  Now that we've been introduced to the character, we can only hope the next few episodes let him shine!

I do agree that they should have been handled better by the Police.  It should never have been allowed to get that far, but then again how do you control human emotions? I hope the police will look at these cases and review the way they allow undercover cops to operate.  This kind of infiltration smells of Stazi style tactics.

Having thought about it, it's just not that simple.  The first time a terrorist cell is stopped from committing an atrocity in the UK by using these tactics, the police involved will be hailed as heroes, and the methods used vindicated by the public.  Really the devil is in the detail.

true,Abadoobie,null,null,"Moffat writes this show like a bulldozer plows a hiking trail. He knows where he wants to start and knows where he wants to finish and he just plows through the wilderness in a straight line until he gets to the end. He disregards most of what makes a trail worth walking as long as he gets to the end.

Reason, believability, and consistency don't matter. His episodes often have scenes that don't logically follow, he ignores obvious consequences and solutions including those of basic physics, he pays no mind to anything that has previously happened in the Doctor Who universe and he has absolutely no talent for writing sci-fi or world building.

His writing forces everything in the show to spontaneously reshape itself to suit the story whenever it's needed. The rules constantly change, the characters constantly change, motivations, feelings, morals, memory, behavior, wants, desires, they all change as needed to make the story happen. That's simply poor storytelling. 

He hides all of this inadequate writing behind a claim of being clever and so do his fans. He isn't clever. Plenty of shows write long-story arcs that span seasons, especially in the last 10 years, without railroading the characters or forcing scenes that don't make sense simply because his ""clever"" story requires it to happen that way.

He is a sloppy writer who focuses too much on trying to be clever at the expense of everything else. He has no skill for writing science, technology or physics, which are required for good sci-fi, and he is too inconsistent to create an engaging, interesting or complex universe.

When he wrote stories that could have fitted quite well into Classic Who (Silence in the Library, The Empty Child... and okay, the Girl in the Fireplace is an exception) his stories were excellent.

I strongly suspect Capaldi is ushering us into an era of more classic-type sensibilities -- less manic running around, more thought and manipulation.  I was always a large fan of Moffat's writing, but last season did begin to pall somewhat for me -- but I see reason to hope that we're going back to those tropes and styles Moffat (and Who in general!) are more comfortable with.

Or maybe I'm just an eternal optimist.  Remember, though -- Tom Baker had 'Robot' as his first story (which had effects bad even for Who and a storyline that was just better than incoherent) and McCoy's first few adventures were riddled by him being given inadequate directions on how to play the character.  Even Hartnell's regeneration story was the least-watched ever up till that point and was widely considered pretty bad, but Troughton turned out just fine.

I guess I'm just trying to say there's room for cautious optimism -- we know Moffat *can* pull out good material and he's got what appears to be an excellent Doctor.

&gt;

&gt;__Mark Roberts__ is a [British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) [streaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaking) who has run [naked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked) during several international events.

&gt;A father of three, Roberts' streaking began when he saw a female streaker run naked down a 1993 [Rugby Sevens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_Sevens) game in [Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong). After a bet in a bar, he went naked in front of the crowd himself the next day.

&gt;Roberts, who lives on unemployment benefits has only ever had one job which ended in arrest.

But you wouldn't know that about me, because you assumed i started supporting in 2008. I know exactly what it is to suffer abuse from United fans when we were awfully shit, 2006 under Pearce in particular lives long in the memory. How can you tell me this club is not part of my identity, or that I don't understand, when I watch every match at ungodly times like 3am, even doing so back in the old, much less successful days? I am as much a City fan as you, it is as much a part of my identity as it is yours, and yes, I hate united fans as much as you do, because i've had to fucking live with it my whole life as well. You do not get to tell me to learn more and that I don't understand just because you were born in Manchester. I do appreciate the rivalry, god knows i've had to live with it, but it doesn't take away from my and others' point: Yes it's fun to laugh at united at the moment, but we did not need a full thread dedicated to it, posted by the person who started the arguments in the first place.

What characterizes the Spurs-way is a commitment to offense rather than defense, creativity rather than structure, and fast moving attacks rather than possession based style.


So your questions is almost impossible to answer. But the short answer is yes to both. 


Spurs have lots in common with the tradition of football that Barca (it is only since 2010 or so they became obsessed with possession) is playing. Tiki-taka is not as defining of Barcelona as the Dutch tradition of total football is.  Anyway, you can draw direct lines from Spurs' free flowing football of the early 50s (which was revolutionary at the time) to Ipswich and Ajax (both where coached by former Spurs players. Ipswich (under Robson) and Ajax (under Rinus) would in turn both influence football to a great extent, and in particular so Barcelona. The team might be the contemporary embodiment of that commitment. But as we already can see, football is constantly developing. We are, fortunately, returning to faster football, with less emphasis on possession.

Wenger is actual very close to the Spurs commitment of fast flowing football. If anyone can embody Spurs as a player in the past decades, it should be Glenn Hoddle. He, of course played under Wenger for a number of years.

TV/Internet is a separate affair. For that I'd recommend Virgin. Virgin are the only provider in Belfast that deliver internet and TV via cable (as opposed to the Fibre-To-The-Cabinet (FTTC) technology provided by other providers). Virgin currently offer the fastest internet. Their best package combines the Virgin TV service (with Tivo) and unlimited 160mbps internet. They have lesser packages too if you can't afford their most expensive package (it is fairly expensive, especially if you are in a single-person household). Virgin cable TV doesn't add that much more to what you can already get with a simple and cheap Freeview set-top box (delivered via digital terrestrial aerial) to be honest. We only have it because the internet is fast and it was bundled with a Tivo box for recording TV and watching on-demand TV etc. Plus the extra channels that Virgin have aren't too bad. 

Sky satellite TV do TV/Internet bundles but I imagine you are living in rented accommodation and so installing a satellite probably isn't possible or feasible.

&gt; There are perhaps five or six hundred Britons currently out there – overwhelmingly, though not exclusively, young men. If and when there is a real attempt to take on Isil, they may come back in a hurry and in a group. Some of them will present more of a risk than others, but the evidence seems to be that most of the jokers – such as those portrayed in the satirical film Four Lions – have already come home.
&gt; It is the harder nuts that are staying longer. When they come back, they will need surveillance at the very least, and we must look again at our system of monitoring these people.
&gt; The Lib Dems will oppose the return of control orders; but even Nick Clegg would surely accept that times have changed. If we have to bring back control orders for some of the more serious risks, we should do so immediately. And unless they come back – and if they continue to give allegiance to a terrorist state – then absolutely we should take away their citizenship.
&gt; All this will be difficult, but the problem has got worse fast, and it could get worse still. What is the point of having a defence budget if we don’t at least try to prevent the establishment of a terrorist “caliphate” that is profoundly hostile to civilised values?

[""Motella, my love! Have you seen that clasp! The beetle one. The Egyptians do love a scarab!""](http://i.imgur.com/ChVKPCh.png) 

then we see [this](http://i.imgur.com/AGkYSiD.png) handed to him from his wife

Sorry for the bad quality but from this I think it could go either way. I don't think they had this in mind when writing the episode and at that point it probably was just a clasp but It was shown throughout the episode that the population of Pompeii were wrongly calling things by different names. 

The ""clasp"" could just be how they interpret this watch and its practical uses. It looks different from 10 and 11's watches but that doesn't mean it can't be another one. When he was handed the ""clasp"" he was playing with it rather manically in his hands and was looking at it intently before his daughter distracted his glare. 

In short, if they wanted to they could easily do a bit of Moffat-Magic and have it be a time lord chameleon device. I don't know if they will actually do anything about it thought, it may just be a little easter egg, a nod to us that the Doctor believes he has seen this face before. He could just as easily be a civil servant who shot himself when earth was invaded by the 456 in Torchwood.

true,borez,cnty-england,Geordie in London,"The volume went up usually means that person has fixated on the noise. You get a pretty standard noise level of 92-100db occasionally peaking at 102-105db in a live venue, anything louder than that and the punters ( and barstaff ) will complain as it'll be uncomfortable, anything lower than that and you can't hear the vocals over the drumkit and backline. Again everyone complains. 

Obviously this depends on the type of bands playing, rock music is significantly louder than acoustic but that's your basic venue noise levels. 

So basically the volume can't significantly increase unless the owner puts in a way larger rig and has upped the bass end. Which doesn't actually mean that the volume is louder, it means that the frequencies will travel further. 



Which leads up to: ""There's no new system. Nothing has been turned up or turned down. Why would we?""

Basically - as is usually the case with venue complaints like this -  the person complaining has fixated on the noise coming from the venue. 

As this always swings the way of the person complaining the venue will lose it licence and either have to shut its doors or not have band nights. ",0,1408969193,null,0,1408969399,0,cjzw21x,t3_2eipy6,t1_cjzw21x,t1_cjzvuos,null,1427368870,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

&gt;We also need to be far more effective in preventing British and other foreigners from getting out there (I am interested to see how many Belgians are there); and the Turks need to shut that border. We need to make it crystal clear that you will be arrested if you go out to Syria or Iraq without a good reason. At present the police are finding it very difficult to stop people from simply flying out via Germany, crossing the border, doing their ghastly jihadi tourism, and coming back. The police can and do interview the returnees, but it is hard to press charges without evidence. The law needs a swift and minor change so that there is a “rebuttable presumption” that all those visiting war areas without notifying the authorities have done so for a terrorist purpose.

Now, the last sentence is what has allowed the press to jump on a band-wagon of this being an attack on the presumption of innocence, but it's not necessarily true.

One way to accomplish what he wants would be to introduce a new offence of travelling to Iraq/Syria without registering your intention to travel and reasons for travelling in advance in the UK, or for those already in these countries, to register with UK embassies or consulates within two months.

It would pretty much accomplish exactly what he says, with such a law there effectively is a presumption that anyone flying out to Iraq and Syria without a good reasons is engaging in terrorism, and yet it doesn't overturn the principle of innocent until proven guilty because the crime isn't terrorism but travelling to a restricted country, and the prosecution would have to prove you travelled.

The problem here is that Johnson was focusing on the reasoning and effects for his proposed law, rather than its actual wording.

true,TeaJizzle,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"&gt;and once someone fixates on the noise you're basically screwed.

That brings back horrible memories from a few years ago. I run a venue with a few nearby houses, it's a converted factory with 2ft solid walls so the noise problem isn't really an issue.

Problem was, an 80 year old couple who probably didn't have anything better to do than complain. The first time I went to see them after a complaint, I thought they were having me on, ""close your eyes and hold your breath, you can hear a beat every now and then"". It was next-doors tv, I couldn't hear anything from our place.

Whenever they saw newspaper adverts for our gigs, they would ring and complain about the noise in advance.

We once got contacted by the council after they recorded ""banging"" on a day we weren't open, it turned out to be an african wedding (will drums and stuff) in a garden a few houses down.

They called to complain about the noise after they saw a band load in through the back. It a wedding singer and keyboard player going through a small keyboard amp and a pair of 15""s. They didn't get disturbed by the drum and base event the night before or the metal gig the night after.

Another time they complained of ""banging"" again, I went down to have a look and it was kids playing football on the street in front of their house.

We had two visits by the council, had to spend a few hundred quid on new fire escape doors to appear to be proactive, get on their good side and avoid any suggestion of a noise limiter, which the couple protested we should have.

They both seemed quite nice and reasonable otherwise, they moved out a couple of years ago now, but holy shit they were frustrating. Luckily the rest of the street are mostly regulars and everyone else I've asked have never heard a thing, so we're pretty lucky I guess.

Spiteful neighbours must be a huge pain in the arse for so many venues, people complain about councils not taking complaints seriously, but it can definitely go the other way and disrupt businesses that aren't causing any harm as well.

Crowds making noise when they leave, fair enough, that's why we pay for extra door staff, and you always get the odd idiot, but this couple lived to the rear of the premises and were far away from any of that.

I understand and hear what our critics say. However, I would simply say this to them: by all means make your points and I assure you we’re listening. But give us credit for the huge change of a positive nature we have brought about in our country over these past 20 years... We are going to have to go step by step.”

I'm not a big fan of Blair at all, but I really think this is sensationalist and blatantly witch-hunting reporting. I honestly don't see anything remotely close to ""defending a massacre"" in there.

It would probably be easier and therefore cheaper to sound proof the dwelling than the venue. The venue and the council could chip in for triple glazed windows and some cavity wall insulation, it would be a one off cost probably way less &lt; £10k, the venue remains open, the council still receive the license and rates from the venue, and any potential new tenants can live there peacefully. Yet nobody seems to have this approach. 

I think it's all too easy to say the guy who's complaining is a dick. You could easily move to somewhere new where there's some kind of sensory grievance, sound or even smell. I.e you could inadvertently move near a local tip, which on a hot day and with the wind in the right direction could make your place stink.

1) Physically - I agree that he's been unfortunate with injuries, but his physicality will only improve with game time and as his body naturally develops, wait for him to get his 'man strength'

2) Technically - I don't know how you can say that Borini is not a technically gifted player, it's basically one of the sole reasons that he was one of Rodger's first transfers. Brendao holds technical ability above all others when he looks for players, it's the hallmark of the majority of his signings.

3) Mentally - Surely his mental strength is evident by the fact that he wanted to stay and compete for a chance to play in the team, he obviously believes he is a good enough player to have an impact here. This is further show by the fact that he refused a permanent transfer, most other players would have done the easy thing and accepted the move to Sunderland where he would surely be put on a pedestal and be guaranteed a big role to play for upcoming seasons.

Someone living in Milton Keynes who currently commutes to London may now choose to look for a job in Birmingham because travel has become cheaper. Having more options is great for the  commuter, but the driver who's subsidising it sees no benefit from that. 

You assume that the alternative to train travel is always driving. It could just as easily involve finding a job closer to home, one that can be walked or cycled to, working from home or teleconferencing. 

People, being largely rational, will choose the option that's cheapest and still fulfils their needs. In other words, they'll factor in the length and cost of their commute, traffic, the cost of housing in different locations, and the amenities offered, and the different jobs that are available around the country, and the pay offered, and will choose the options that maximise their utility. 

The stockbroker is still going to pay the full cost of his ticket because his alternatives are the high cost of housing and raising a family within London or driving to an office every morning through traffic, paying a congestion charge and then having to pay for parking, when instead he could just get on a train and either sleep or get some work done on his phone or laptop.

1) Not many young players who suffer repeated injuries to the same part of their body manage a career without that being a constant battle for them and a strain on their performance.

2) Brendan Rogers has saw his technical ability throughout his career, for Roma and more directly on the Chelsea and Swansea training pitches but neither Brendan Rogers or we have seen him prove that he can use that ability at Premier League level, glimpses at Sunderland but nothing special, nothing to imply he'll be good enough for a top team.

3) Sure he's a determined guy but by I was referring to his mental ability on the field his decision making is certainly not a glowing attribute for him. 

Now, I don't know what you mean by don't rate him *personally*; how else should I rate him? I rate him like everyone else by watching him play competitive football and I've come to the conclusion he is not good enough for Liverpool, he's not a starter and sure isn't an impact player so what role would he fill? He's a decent enough player for a lower premier league team but that's it. I predict he will have a few decent seasons at Sunderland and move back to Italy.

Well, my theories on how it'll all tie together. 

Also, based on a few things, I think River is coming back, and all the math the doctor is working on is to help save her from the Library. ""He's made a lot of mistakes, time to correct them."" The steam punk theme in Rivers sonic/steam punk theme in the new opening. She talks about how young Ten looks. And as they say goodbye in the Name of the Doctor, she says ""spoilers"" as she fades. Clara and her are mentally linked, if she's dead, how is she still there? I think Calpaldi will save her, and they'll go on to have lots of Timelord babies (when the doctor presents the cradle, I think two things happened there. One, River shows her name being translated, and two, as the camera scrolls across the cradle and pans back up to the doctor and River. They say hello, and then the doctor says ""So that means we...(kissy noises)"" River in a very seductive way says ""Yeees"" and the doctor looks kind of bashful and excited and runs off. In the library, River has three kids (including the girl that is the computer.) and in the Fires of Pompeii they have two kids. I think they're all Time Lords. I could see the doctor gifting River regenerations as payback for the ones she gave him. 

I'll admit, it's a stretch, but a fan can dream :D  

Edit: I've always thought that River seemed older, wiser, and different from all the other Rivers in this scene. I don't know if they did it on purpose, but anyway, [Here's the video from ""A Good Man Goes to War.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e8tOF3PeH0)

Here we actually see the next regeneration. Surely freezing Gallifrey would have required communication between TARDISs (correct pluralization?) so the Doctor has actually seen/talked to his next self.

Ten would know that keeping his face counted meaning he had only one more body left. So the idea that Jackson Lake could be any Doctor but the next ism't possible. But maybe Ten was assuming that he would figure out a way to have more regenerations since that's the kind of thing the Doctor does.

1) By repeated injury you mean his shoulder I'm assuming? And I'm not sure if you've seen the challenge which cased the injury, where Keita sat on him ([video] (http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/football/video-1107405/Liverpool-v-Roma-Fabio-Borini-shoulder-injury.html)). I'd say this was more misfortune than a recurring injury, but then I don't come from a medical background so it's hard for me to say. I also struggle to think of any football player who have been sidelined for constantly in their careers because of recurring shoulder injuries, please feel free to mention any that come to mind. Also during his time at Sunderland he managed 40 appearances without a single substantial injury.

2) He is still relatively inexperienced in the premier league, as last season was his first full season. I don't think he was provided with adequate opportunities to showcase his technical abilities, the premier league is renowned for being one of, if not the most, competitive leagues in Europe, where you have very little time on the ball. When you also consider he played mostly as a center forward for a very poor Sunderland side, it's hardly surprising that you can only recall glimpses of his technical ability being on show (moments such as [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLOKuho3VPY) maybe).

3) He's still young, you expect his decision making to improve with age and experience would you not? 

The improvement in his performances after playing a full season should not be taken for granted, I think he should be given a chance to prove himself alongside the current crop of Liverpool players. The 2012/13 team in which he made his first impression was miles behind the current side. Brendan saw something in him which made him sanction him as his first purchase and you could argue that he's never really had a second chance since his first injury. At the end of the day, even if he would only be a 3rd/4th string striker then it's a vast improvement to what we had a few seasons ago, you only need to look at the choices city have as center forwards to understand the depth required in a title winning squad (Aguero, Dzecko, Jovetic and Negredo). He also offers something substantially different to Lambert, even after signing Mario we only have one truly pacey center forward in Sturridge, who we all know has his own Injury problems. I think there are much more arguments for keeping him than for shipping him off to Sunderland permanently, at the end of the day what do we care if FSG take a hit of a few million if it doesn't work out, it's not our money.

true,phys1cs,null,null,"Your platform may have a facility to do this. Otherwise, you can work out the monthly gain by dividing (the value of the portfolio in one month minus the cash added in that month) by the value of the portfolio in the previous month. This will give you eg. 1.01 if it's gone up by 1% or 0.97 if it went down by 3%. Multiply the monthly gains together for the year to get the compounded annual gain, eg. 1.01 * 0.97 * ... * 1.02 = 1.12, for a 12% gain overall. It's important to subtract the cash added each month when calculating the gain over the previous month, as otherwise you'll have an overly optimistic picture of how your investments are doing. Doing this should be easy in Excel or similar - eg. if column A is the total value of the portfolio in each month (after cash additions and any capital gains/losses, fees and income) and column B is the net amount of cash you added in that month, the gain in month 3 is (A3-B3)/A2. Subtract 1 and multiply by 100% if you want a % increase rather than a multiple of the previous month.

If you're looking to calculate capital gains for tax purposes (rather than for a representative indicator of investment performance), you should instead add up the net amount of cash you've added in the year then subtract that plus the value of the portfolio at the start of the year from the value at the end of the year (then subtract any allowance etc). This is less useful since more of the capital gains would be expected come from the end of the year (when you have personally added more cash), perhaps even if the portfolio was performing better earlier in the year, eg. 4% of £10,000 gives the same capital gain as 5% of £8000.",0,1408976791,null,0,1408980788,0,cjzynli,t3_2ej0aw,t1_cjzynli,t3_2ej0aw,null,1427367658,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

I don't revise, no point and you will see those with huge arrogance and ego deflated. My advice to all of you is hard work doesn't equal to success, hard work plus persistence alongside defining all the odds is the only thing that will change the curse word you use when you open that envelop. Another advice which is so important, make yourself a good squad. A set of friends who want the best for you and you all push each other up to success, meanwhile also competing with them because nothing drives you like competition and responsibility to othersAnother is that: Those who say 'gcse don't mean anything' are absolute bullshiters. GCSEs in the grand scheme of things are your foundation and define your work ethic and your boundaries.

1: Correct me, if I am wrong, but I believe the reason why it is hard(er) to open an account int the UK is due to people who try to beat the system. Example:Person lands in the UK, opens 5 bank accounts with £1000 overdraft, buys stuff with that money and leaves the next day. The bank has no way of finding me. I think its a security precaution.
3: Cheques are being phased by all banks by 2018 I believe. Extra note: If you went to USA, you'd be surprised how many people do not even have Chip &amp; Pin bank cards. Majority still on Magnetic Strip.
11: Agree. The insurance malarkey is way OTT. I would like to add the No Claim Bonus. And it takes months to sort it.
15: I have been through Lithuanian education, completed School, College and University in the UK. At first I thought, oh great no homework at school. How cool is that. College, what? You want me to do homework. University - give me more homework. I can relate to your stepson. I was an average student in LT. In the UK I have the highest level degree in Computer Science. WTF? I could go on and on about education side.
I feel the same as you - I love living in the UK too. And yes service may be worse in other parts off the island, but its the people that make the difference. I mean if I can walk down a street and people smile at you and you smile at them (not in a creepy way), walk into any shop - people are polite smiling, if someone bumps into me, they apologise with a smile and life moves on.

I think people's beef with education comes down to inequality of services. Over the years, I have lived in a few other European countries and nowhere else have I found the variance in quality between schools so huge. Of course, there are good and bad schools everywhere, but I would say a bad Swedish school will prepare a student better than a bad UK one and a good student at a bad Swedish school will not have a handicap as big as a good student at a bad UK school. 

People I was acquainted with at university always used to say things like ""85% of people from my school go to Oxford or Cambridge"" or ""I'm the first person from my school to go to Oxford"". And I always found statements such as that one quite baffling and, indeed, indicative of the problem I am describing. 

Now this comes down to several factors - political system, society, the (comparably) incredible prevalence and prominence of private education in the UK - so it is not easily solved, but this is something that has always struck me as quite strange, considering how generally proud people seem to be of education in the UK.

&gt;Ill people at work.

I hate this. A guy I work with hasn't been off ill in 12 years. He's ill sometimes and just sits and coughs and sniffs. Mate, your job isn't so important that you can't take 2 days off to get better, and when *I* get ill because you're coughing shit at me, I'm staying home and drinking chicken soup and watching reruns of friends.

&gt;""Do not hog the right/middle lane"". 

Let me stop you right there. There is no 'right' or 'middle' lane. There are only 2 lanes - the inside lane, and overtaking lanes. You stay on the inside lane if you're coming off at the next junction, if you're a slower moving vehicle (caravans, lorries, wide loads etc). You use the overtaking lanes to overtake other vehicles. That is it. If you're overtaking lorries and you're doing the speed limit and not driving like a mug, then fine, use the passing lane. Ignore that tosser behind you who thinks he's Mad fucking Max 2014 with his black Audi and LED strips who refuses to use the passing lane to go around you. If you're doing the same speed as the lorries but won't move over 'in case you get boxed in', you're being a prick. It's context-sensitive, but fyi, INSIDE LANE, OVERTAKING LANES. Here's the article in the highway code regarding lane discipline: https://www.gov.uk/motorways-253-to-273/lane-discipline-264-to-266

&gt;Insure EVERYTHING. It's a jungle to understand what I really need, and what is just being actively sold to me.

Insurance you *need*: car insurance. It's illegal to drive without it. Everything else is optional. I insure stuff I could not afford to replace if it broke. Some people think it's dumb, I don't give a fuck. I could put away money in a savings account and get stuff replaced, but I don't. I don't have much insurance. But basically, if you think you need it, you should get it. Do not listen to *anybody* who works for the company. They want you to buy it, because you give them a monthly income. There are plenty of finance websites/forums/subreddits that can help you with this.

&gt;I love: train services in my area, always on time and well connected. I hate: train tickets price. WTF, I know someone who spends over 1/3 of his salary just to get to work for a month!

I'm glad the trains are good for you - they suck for me. Regularly late, cancelled, short, terrible. It also costs nearly 1/4 of my salary to get to work each month. I fucking hate - no, I *loath* the train services. Ours are the most expensive in Europe I think.

&gt;Daily Mail. Seriously? Who buys this... thing?

People who blame our problems on the flavour of the month. Some months it's immigrants, other months it's muslim extremists, other months it's the youth of today, and other times it's because of change. Basically it's sensationalist nonsense written by sell-outs for traditionalist, conservatives morons.

&gt;David Cameron. The manipulative, populistic, clueless prick. I always thought Polish politicians are the worst, but not anymore. How someone like that becomes a Prime Minister, I don't know. And people generally believe what he says. Which brings me to...

Come on. Ol' boy Davey' C ain't that bad. I could write a 30,000 dissertation on how much of a cunt that guy is and only scratch the surface, but to single him out it's pretty stupid. Nearly all politicians are power-driven, narcissistic, sociopathic maniacs not fit to run a country. The problem is, no one normal wants to step up to the plate. And even if they did, they couldn't, because the barrier of entry is huge and complex. And even if they *did* get in, they'd be worse at running it than the politicians are. We have 2 hopes - Bob Hope, and no hope.

&gt;Education. I admit that, my stepson is not the brightest star in the galaxy

Jeez, don't get me started. We teach our children to memorise data and information, then regurgitate said information in order to tick all the boxes, so that when they go out to the working world they can do exactly that - regurgitate data and information and put it all into a spreadsheet haha. Nah I think education is fucked. As you say, we don't teach self-improvement at all, and a lot of kids feel entitled and thus have no desire to seek out worth for themselves. I was one of those kids who cruised through school and thought it would all come to me on a plate.

true,RifleEyez,null,null,"Yup. It still hurts hearing him mention joining us live on TV in Belgium, and admitting he would have signed for us after his Chelsea move but we didn't make the CL despite finishing 4th. Chelsea finished outside the CL spots, yet took the 4th spot because they were the holders. I think even more Spursy they changed that rule now haven't they? 

Other fans give it the ''Hazard acted like that with every club, etc etc'' but he came out on TV and said it :( That's the difference - it could have been Hazard - Eriksen - Lamela and whoever else we could have attracted - and Chelsea with Marin and so on...but nope. Man...that game. Bayern dominated, then, in the most Spursy way possible Bayern score in the 85th minute. That's it, Muller has scored game over we're in the CL - massive boost of finances, exposure - 38 games of hard work. Phew. Then, Chelsea come back minutes later, Robben misses a Extra Time penalty and Bayern lose the shootout.

That is 100% Spurs. We're good at missing out on the CL by fine point margins and fucking ridiculous circumstances like that. Don't get me started on Lasagne-gate, and City/Chelsea being bought out and sewing up 2 spots now every single year when we've grinded from the shit days of the 90's till now, and nope - City and Chelsea get auto-CL passes now every year because of their rich chairmen. City were a bottom half side, and Chelsea weren't far of going into Administration. 

Welcome to Spurs!

Councils do take complaints seriously,  but only when they actually receive those complaints. 

Most people will complain to their friends and family and never bother to make an official complaint to their council. So, of course, nothing gets done about it. 

I work for the council as a customer service operative. I deal with lots of minor complaints every day, yet I don't think I've ever had more than 5 people per day take the 2 minutes to fill in the required paperwork to register a complaint. (All filled in by myself, they don't even have to write it themselves.)

People just want someone to listen to them have a good moan. Once they've got it out of their system they're typically much happier as a result because they feel their grievance has been taken care of, even if they come back a few days later and moan about the same thing.

We're British. We would like to see things improve, if that's not too much bother. If it doesn't get fixed we'll just have another moan and carry on. ",0,1408981640,null,0,false,0,ck00ubp,t3_2eipy6,t1_ck00ubp,t1_cjzwgba,null,1427366639,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Councils have to by law spend money on certain things which is why a lot of the services which the council isn't obliged to provide by law are being removed, this really has a knock on impact on other services too.

The problem is simple, Conservatives and Liberals have absolutely slashed the amount it gives to local government and made it not attractive for councils to raise council tax.

And how dare you put words in my mouth.  I never even said I hated anyone for this.  You're trying to make me an enemy by creating a make-believe argument that's easy to fight against.  I REALLY want more homosexual and bisexual and other sexual relationships in TV and movies.  I just want them to also be actual characters, who aren't limited to their sexuality (so far Jenny's only purpose seems to be as a lover to Vastra, and I'd love to see her come into her own).  I don't want writers to say, ""Well we need some diversity, so let's just add a couple gays and voila!""  I want them to make up characters that are complex and three dimensional, where their sexuality is one of many nuances that can be explored and discussed, not the one big thing.  

As an example, if you've ever watched Buffy, I thought Willow's lesbian relationships were great.  She was a fantastic character on her own merits.  They had some great lovey dovey romance scenes, but both she and Tara were great characters on their own and could be appreciated from many different angles.  That's what I want to see.  So don't presume to say I'm hating anyone, that's absolutely ridiculous.

You can't just carry passengers at this stage with us missing out on the CL by fine point margins. I'm the same with Townsend. Academy lad, do I wish he turned into Robben one day? Yes. Do I forgive him for 1 goal and 2 assists in 25 games, when if he even just doubled that it could have turned 3 draws into 3 wins? No. Do I think we should get rid for anything over 10m, and upgrade? Yes. 

It's for the best, FOR THE CLUB as a whole - despite growing to love those players and them being the reason we got here.

The only time Mourinho has criticized a player is when he has been trying to et them to raise their game. I wouldn't necessarily try to make this case, but it could be argued that by not laying down any sort of marker for Torres, Jose is saying that he essentially has no expectations for him. Like, ""he's a hard worker, he's a good boy, what else you can expect from him"". 

What Id really be interested in seeing is some objective evidence based on his play that he does work hard all the time. For instance, in 2014 against WBA, Torres came on in 69th minute and in 21+ minutes managed a total of 3 touches, 2 of which resulted in misplayed passes.

Dawson probably isn't good enough for us now but I do think his criticism of him is often exaggerated, people complain about his pace like he's suddenly lost a key part of his game. He's never been quick and top strikers have often gotten the better of him but he's still fantastic in the air, great at blocking crosses/shots and will often get the better of lesser strikers. 

Criticism of Lennon however I think, by this point, is fair. He's really not done anything for two years now. He's got a great attitude and he works hard but he really offers so little going forward now that, as has been said by RifleEyez, there isn't much room for sentimentality.

&gt;The changeover to selling of petrol by the litre rather than by the gallon took place after the Board was wound up. It was prompted by a technical shortcoming of petrol pump design: pumps (which were electro-mechanical) had been designed to be switchable between metric and imperial units, but had no provisions for prices above £1.999 per unit of fuel. Once the price of petrol rose above £1 per gallon, the industry requested that they be permitted to sell fuel by the litre rather than the gallon, enabling them to reduce the unit price by a factor of about 4.5 and so to extend the lives of existing pumps.

Personally, as someone who's all for the UK finally finishing the metrication program and abolishing the imperial measurement system from our road signs, I wish they'd finally get on with it and do the job properly, rather than half-arsing everything like this.

Yes. I'm always wary of arguments that have a narrative pushing them, in this case its gender I see it a lot with the ""Muslim"" argument too. You're fooling yourself if you think everyone comes to a debate with the best intentions.  
I'm not discrediting their argument by saying its false but merely stating that it comes from a dubious mindset and as such I'm not willing to touch it unless someone can prove to me its more than that.  
If this wasn't the case I'd still be arguing with racists over at Stormfront like I did when I was 13 years old. There is only a certain amount of respect I'll afford arguments that are made to push a certain narrative and time makes me weary.  

But hey, just for you, lets have a look shall we?  

&gt; I think people just want to see women receiving the same types of sentencing as men for the same crimes. 

No, citation, pure agenda

&gt; One compounds this matter further is that feminists and even many MPs then pretend its women who are the ones treated unfairly by out justice system, which is in fact one of the biggest lies around.

Well this is _obviously_ a well sourced argument rounded in objective judgement as opposed to some sort of narrative....

&gt; The best summary of the problem is probably a speech given by Philip Davies MP a couple of years ago, 

oh here we go, we finally have a source, maybe he'll let us into his arguments?

&gt; who went up massively in my estimation after he debunked so many myths on the subject so brilliantly (and he did so from the perspective of someone who had blindly believed them all for a long time)

okay, so this is empty. So what, we just follow Philip Davies now? What does he say, how does he do? I have no idea.... 

Conclusion: likely narrative, even if it isn't there are still no points of contention made open here. The author purely wants you to nod to the first two lines to be able to get into the next ones (the bit about Philip Davies).  I mean _maybe_ i'll research into Mr Davies but to be honest I find the whole ""posting an article about a woman getting 11 years as an excuse to talk about the gender gap in sentencing"" is a bit rubbish.

America did this in WW2, in exchange for 50 destroyers, we had to stop trading with our empire and allow America to make 30 bases, then when that didn't work, in exchange for full help in the war, America demanded we gave away all our secrets: How to break the enigma code, how to make the atomic bomb, how to create radar, the jet engine, submarines ect ect. And then US built a giant propaganda scheme to get everyone to buy bonds and help out in the war. This won us the war, but at the cost of our empire, as America didn't like our empire or want us to have it, so it diplomatically destroyed it and quickly became the worlds superpower because of that. America even had a plan to attack Britain but they didn't.

This is probably how Germany would approach the war, they would most likely pressure the Eu into stopping all trade with us, which would crush us, then we would have to look elsewhere, most likely America and the commonwealth. And of course America is a sneaky corrupt bastard that needs to be wiped of the planet and rebuilt, so they would probably not help us until we give up some other form of power. But all in all, it would inevitably turn into another WW2, because Russia would likely see this as a chance to re-take the soviet union, while the Eu is weakened and bobs your uncle.

It's completely ironic. As someone from the Republic, I'd find it amusing if it weren't so tragic that a subsection of Unionists are so hell bent on clinging to an ideology which, by their own admission at the polling booth, is represented by people who they consider as working against their own interests. I personally think that Republican parties do more for the interests of all working class people, not just Loyalists, than the majority of Unionist parties or politicians.

If these people are willing to vote for Republican parties, who operate solely on Republican political agendas, then I don't see what big problem they'd have living in a Republic.

Talking to the tax office is impossible and you need an appointment for EVERYTHING, which I find incredibly annoying but the Dutch find normal... do you see what I mean?

Also, the school your step-kid is in sounds fairly unpleasant- I don't know where you live nor where you came from in Poland but I can promise you that my educational experience was nothing like that, in spite of growing up in the poorest part of [England - which as this source points out is poorer than Poland](http://www.westbriton.co.uk/Cornwall-officially-poorest-area-UK/story-21062714-detail/story.html).

The biggest problem is if you are moderately smart, you don't need to be particularly hard-working to get reasonably good GCSE results. You can be spectacularly lazy and still get reasonable results.

A-levels are a totally different kettle of fish, for a number of reasons:

 - You categorically HAVE to put in the effort to get good results. Very, very few kids are clever enough to get good results without the effort.
 - Quite often, the A-levels you choose will be based not on what you want to study, but what you have to study for a particular degree. It's very easy to find a degree you'd get on really well with that requires an A-level in a subject that you don't get on so well with - even a degree that requires an A-level that will never be particularly relevant. GCSEs, you're doing so many of them that choosing the right ones is much less of a concern.

Also, there are several South American restaurants in my area, which I've noticed tend to be generally better value for money.

My general advise is to abandon the vast majority of what is advertised as mexican food, bbq, and pizza immediately. If you become convinced by your co-workers' insistence that they know of the absolute most amazing pizza place, be prepared to smile and make the right noises when ordering a £10 ($16.50) ""Extra Large American Pizza"" gets you a 12"" naan topped with ketchup, cheddar, tuna, and sweetcorn.

Instead, spend the next year or three figuring out the whole spectrum of curry.

&gt; Thirdly, having a suburban house and struggling to feed your family is not real quality of life. America's bottom 20% own houses, cars, and little else. 

I really think you need to show the evidence you have here that people in the bottom 20% of the United States population ""struggle to feed their families"" more than people in the bottom fifth of the UK do. And that the bottom 20% are spending money on houses rather than food. Please do not use anecdotal evidence.

I see anything with an ""us vs. them"" mentality as inherently sectarian. Because it deals with one ""sect"" versus an other.

true,specofdust,,Abbot. Lots of Abbot.,"You can all calm your buttholes, I took one for the team and did some very unrepeatable googling on turd science:

*""That said, the normal range spans three times a day to once every three days, meaning the average person poops approximately once a day — about 1 ounce of stool for each 12 pounds of her or his body weight. That means a person weighing 160 pounds produces an average of just under a pound of poop each day.""*

That means that I_Fixed_My_Drier should weigh between 48 and 144 lbs depending on the frequency of poopage. Given that 48 lbs would be a very low body weight, we can safely assume that I_Fixed_My_Drier is a tri-daily pooper. If I_F_M_D is actually only a twice daily crapper then it's more likely that they're still growing (i.e. a teenager) or a very slight and very short lady.

Nouser, on the other hand, would would weigh 130 lbs on the assumption that she is indeed a daily pooper, and given the unlikeness of any adult weighing significantly less than that we can rule out the only once every 2/3 days eventuality, but account for the possibility that nouser does in fact weigh 260 lbs and is a twice daily shitter.

Of course none of this is accounting for possible dwarfism on IFMD or Nouser's parts.

In terms of accommodation, you can't go wrong with either [Travelodge](http://www.travelodge.co.uk/hotels/333/Swansea-Central-hotel) or [Premier Inn](http://www.premierinn.com/en/hotel/SWACIT/swansea-city-centre), both of which are based right next to the nightlife which I'll assume you'd like to check out while you're here; transport from here to the Stadium is also quick and easy.

Get yourself an account on the [club's ticketing website](https://www.eticketing.co.uk/swanstickets/login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fswanstickets%2fmyaccount%2fdefault.aspx), because you'll want to be informed of ticket availability the moment they are up for sale - you have a choice between paying £25 to become a member and get priority, or not paying and hoping tickets go on to general sale (which is unlikely for big opposition but quite possible for bottom half clubs).

If you have further questions by all means let me know and I'll see if I can help. If you get it sorted and get everything booked to come to Swansea by all means post to the sub again for questions about what to do while you're here and where the good pubs are for a drink before the game.

Imagine if the next time you saw your mom she looked completely different and had a completely different personality, and for the next few days couldn't even remember who you were, but she was still your mom. Whether or not you knew it was coming, you'd probably be pretty messed up about it. 

(2) It was established in The Girl in the Fireplace that the ship had enough power to punch a whole in the universe. It's conceivable that during an attempt to do so in a controlled fashion (like in The Girl in the Fireplace) something went terribly awry, and the droids ended up crashing on prehistoric earth. Then they just went on living, trying to get home, ""the long way around.""

(3) The Daleks' memories of the Doctor were wiped by Clara, but they still know of Time Lords, and by the end of The Time of the Doctor the Doctor is an enemy born anew. 

(4) The Daleks have been colored for ages now, and there are constantly new ""legions"" brought up in the Dalek hierarchy. The one's from the WWII episode were just another unique group. And considering that at the end of that season Matt Smith ""reboots"" the universe, there's every chance that the historical anomaly of the Daleks in WWII never happened. 


Now, the one big thing that I would like addressed (because I do agree, some of these inconsistencies are too much at times)... What is the current history of the Who-verse? You have the crack which erased certain things from existence (no one remembers the Dalek invasion or the any of that all from the Tennant era). You have the universe being rebooted. You have the Silence mucking about in history. Then the crack is back. So, after all of that, what has happened, what has been erased, and what loose ends does that leave us with?

So whereas with money in your pocket you naturally regulate your spending, but bank accounts with overdrafts weaken your ability to regulate your spending. If you want to know how much money is in your pocket you count it, but for a bank account you have to go to a cash machine or phone up the bank - much harder to keep track of your balance thus much easier to incur accidental overdraft fees you had no intention of paying.

A good friend of mine the other day sparked one hell of a debate with me about Ched Evans not ""getting enough"" for being sentenced for rape..... so that's the gender argument kinda, sorta in reverse.  

I don't care what people think the sentencing _should_ be if their following conclusions are not about problems with sentencing but instead some pissy gender bollocks. Same here, if we're talking sentencing lets talk sentencing, not the pissy gender bollocks.  

So, how much should someone get for killing their own kid? Twenty years? Ten? Life? What's your position?  
Did someone go and find out the average for the purposes of this debate or were they too busy with their pissy gender bollocks to actually bother to do that?",0,1408985712,null,0,false,0,ck02tus,t3_2eirq9,t1_ck02tus,t1_ck02g1g,null,1427365672,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I have to confess that unless you restrict yourself to a very narrow framework it's a hard sell to prove that the Doctor always acts ethically/morally.

There are many examples where the story ends with a big explosion as the Doctor wipes out the enemy.  Sometimes this can be justified, other times (The Seeds of Death) it's more problematic.

In Doctor Who, sometimes monsters are just monsters (implacable, unstoppable) and there is no other option than to kill or be killed and sometimes there is another way. 

Restricting yourself to NuWho would probably make it easier to prove your proposition - although even here there's plenty of evidence that the Doctor is burdened by regrets from his past, numerous references to The Time War, being taunted by Davros, etc.

If you take the original series onboard then off the top of my head there's three stories in which the Doctor explicitly states, for want of a better word, a mission statement.

The Dalek Invasion of Earth - ""I never take life, unless my own is directly threatened.""

The Moonbase -  ""There are some corners of the universe which have bred the most terrible things. Things which act against everything that we believe in. They must be fought.""

true,AcaiPalm,lfc68,,"Most of his games came in a very poor Sunderland side which barely avoided relegation, and which had a maniac for a manager for half the year. Also don't forget it was his first full season in the premier league; so I think it's a bit harsh to beat him with that stick. A 21 year old Diouf also came off an impressive world cup, I'm not putting him and Origi in the same boat but I can't see how you can say with any sort of certainty that he's far better than Borini, he may well be but I'll wait for him to perform for LFC before passing my judgement. 

A 23 year old who failed to inspire in the prem? How about a 23 year old who dragged his team out of relegation, speak to any Sunderland fan and they will say that his form in the run in was vital to them staying up. His insistence on not leaving because he's loyal to the club which owns him and wants to prove himself to his manager, I don't see how having a player with this attitude is hurting the club because he's exactly the type of player who will give everything in training to prove his worth.

Also nobody seem's to mention the fact that Sturridge is our only striker with real pace who makes runs off the shoulder of the center back, if he's injured we're relying on two players who are more prolific for holding the ball up. If anything he should be kept as another attacking option, it's hardly a bad thing to have a proven premier league goal scorer as a fourth string striker.

If you're desperate, there's always [Chiquitos](http://www.chiquito.co.uk/).  But you gotta be pretty damn desperate.

[Barburrito](http://www.barburrito.co.uk/) isn't bad if you're in the mood for burritos.

[Las Iguanas](http://www.iguanas.co.uk/) isn't too bad for South American food, and you're more likely to have one in your area.

[Wahaca](http://www.wahaca.co.uk/) down in London is damn good eating.  But unfortunately, it's only down in London.

And, as is said before, there is a Taco Bell in Manchester. Things are slightly smaller, but I swear to God, I had a bean burrito, and I nearly burst into tears about how much it tasted like home.

(And, honestly?  Y'all are so lucky. I moved over here 14 years ago, and I couldn't find tortillas in the shops, the only sour cream was a tiny tiny little package, and I had to learn how to make everything from scratch.

I don't like ANY of the circle-jerk bad mouthing of our players, especially some of these guys, but there's reasons why I could see any of them leaving. 

Dawson has more heart than anyone, but he's about to be 31 and he's already been slowing down. Unless he's ok with a lack of play time, he sadly is gonna be on his way out. 

Kaboul is a weird situation. He used to have so much power, speed, and ability. But, he's seemed really off since his injury. I don't know what will happen to him, but if he can't improve upon his performances, then we need to improve upon the position. 

Lennon looked like he could very well get some minutes with us after a good preseason. But, and I've said this for months, I truly expect Lamela and Chadli to come into their own on our wings. What's that leave Lennon? Again, if he's gonna rot on the bench, I'd rather see him leave than waste away on our bench. 
I hope the best for all these players, and for our club. I agree that the bad mouthing is pure, utter, shit. But, for the club and for their careers, I could see all of them leaving.

In the United States, two pints are used: a liquid pint (≈ 473 mL) and a less-common dry pint (≈ 551 mL). Each of these pints is one-eighth of its respective gallon but the gallons differ and the imperial pint is about 20% larger than the US liquid pint. This difference dates back to 1824, when the British Weights and Measures Act standardised various liquid measures throughout the British Empire, while the United States continued to use the earlier English measures. The imperial pint consists of 20 imperial fluid ounces and the US liquid pint is 16 US fluid ounces, making the imperial fluid ounce about 4% smaller than the US fluid ounce.

The treatment Dawson has got from some of our fans is absolutely astonishing. If not for King, who was world class, Dawson would have been easily our best centre back for a number of years, with the most obvious being 09/10 season. He then missed out on most of the CL season through injury and didn't instantly get his place back. Did he complain? No. 

And then suddenly he gets crucified due to being killed last season where the errors were more down to poor tactics than anything else. Dawson never had pace on his side, and the way we lined up every week allowed the opposition to just chip the ball over him with ease to allow the striker to utilise pace. 

I dunno. Maybe its just me, I do love Dawson, but I'm really sad to see Daws go.

Throughout the original series the high turnover of both producers and script editors meant that the tone of the series would change on a much more regular basis.

If I was doing it, I'd restrict myself to one series (say 2005) and see which episodes either support or contradict your opening statement.

The Doctor, as seen in the opening episode, was still deeply affected by the Time War and this would be a continuing thread.  His anger in Dalek, his joy that ""everbody lives"" in The Empty Child/The Doctor   Dances can both be tied back to his experiences in the Time War.

Good point about the half human thing, though, that could definitely open up a lot of wiggle room.

I just rewatched the Fires of Pompeii, however, after reading your comment, and I'm convinced of two things: first, there's no way the writers of that episode anticipated Capaldi's casting as the Twelfth Doctor. Thus, any bridges between Twelve and Calculius (Capaldi's character) are written after the fact. Second, I seriously doubt they could tie it in to make Twelve and River be Calculius and his wife, unless they lose all their memories. It just definitely wasn't written with that idea in mind and there's no way to reverse the way it is.

I think the connection will be strongly surrounding what happened in Pompeii. I think the face that Twelve took on was a subconscious reminder of what happened in Pompeii, and if the Sybilline have any connection to the Pythia then that might be the Doctor's subconscious telling him that's the way back to the TimeLords and Gallifrey. Not to mention that as a merchant it is entirely conceivable Calculius has the painting they are trapped in, or had it at some point.

The ""watch"" at the end of TFoP is not a watch, but a clasp. I doubt it has any connection.

First she has seen lots of Doctors but its a hell of a lot different from seeing them in the past to then having her Doctor be the one who dies and regenerates. He probably had it pretty spot on how she might react. Its not a matter of pure logic there. There is a lot of emotion involved.

In this most recent episode it mentioned the fact they time travelled from the 51st Century. If one ship can go back to renaissance France another could have gone back to Dinosaur times. And they were trying to wait it out until they got back to the 51st Century.

The Daleks know who the Doctor is. Did you miss last years Christmas episode, you know the one where he literally spent centuries battling the Daleks only to defeat them in the end through his regeneration. They had their memories wiped but had hundreds of years after that dealing with him. I think it is around 800 years in all.

As to the bright coloured Daleks, maybe he decided they were a bad idea. They got a lot of flak. That was just one bunch of them that evolved. Did not show it happening to every Dalek everywhere so we cannot assume they would all look like this now. Who knows the brightly coloured ones may still show up.

One thing that really gets on my tits is the way people will ignore your indicator. Now I'll be the first to deride the arseholes who think that using their blinker means they have right of way. However I am constantly bemused by regular inconsiderate nature from other motorists: those who sit in the middle lane overtaking you by a few mph more and ignore your indicator. So you sit there waiting for someone to let you out, but no-one moves into the 3rd lane but just carry on crawling past. I often wonder if that's one of the reasons why people sit in the middle lane: they know how hard it is to get out of the inside when there's a lorry coming up.

In other regards I've noticed that sometimes people do let you out by leaving what they think it adequate room. It constantly amazes me how few people leave the requisite gap between them and the car in front.

We can invent hundreds of ways to get around this, which is what would have happened if Amy and Rory were to continue in the series. For example: Fetch them with the Tardis the year after, have them live out their lives with the Doctor and then have them die in New York on the ""correct"" dates. But they left the show, so this was the way they were written out.  
  
It's a show about time travel, aliens and completely made-up science. There will be a gazillion plot holes if you start analysing details.

The problem is that a lot of people here are young and not particularly politically aware, so they fall over themselves to show how *not* indoctrinated they are, but they end up completely clueless about politics and the policies of the political parties they would 'absolutely never ever vote for'.

If reports are true about De Jong and Blind coming in who will play in midfield? I wouldn't have them alongside eachother.

true,_tpyo,dorset,Dorset,"The New Forest is much more of a DIY place. Good for picknicking or drug benders. I was personally fond of ""dis-orienteering"" when I went there which requires a healthy dose of cannabis :D.  
Its basically trees, some lakes/ponds and some horses that generally mill about the area. I think there might be some horseback riding but I'm not entirely sure. There are also likely some nice pubs about but my dis-orienteering usually avoided those.   

The Purbecks on the other hand have nicer ports of call nearby. There are the ruins of Corfe Castle, as well as the quaint towns of Wareham and Swanage in the area. The kind of places you can easily stop off at and get a nice cream tea, that sort of thing.  
The biggest element of beauty in the purbecks are probably the coastal walks (I recommend cutting in @ Worth Matravers and then heading west) though which are probably less awesome if the wind has picked up. It has the odd beach of geological interest (e.g. Lulworth Cove and Durdle Door) but most of these are a bit shingly. If you're looking for nicer beaches then you'll want to go East as there are some sandy ones in Swanage (big ones) and next to Studland (more private) or the ""best beaches of Britain"" in Bournemouth (a ferry joins the east of the Purbecks with Bournemouth).  

I'd say the Purbecks are probably a bit more flexible if the weather is a bit ""meh"". New Forest is positioned near Lymington, Brockenhurst and Lyndhurst which I haven't fully checked but I don't think they're as twee as Wareham or Swanage.

Also a lot of parents want to change things around because they feel a teacher 'doesn't like' their child so they should be in a different class. 

Our education system is actually quite good at not just making people regurgitate what they have learned. Now they want people to draw their own conclusions, investigate for themselves etc. You cant forget that at the end of the day there are going to be lazy children and there will be engaged children who care.

You should stay left unless you're overtaking or if the left lane leaves the motorway. If everybody was like you and hogged the middle lane then where would people go if they wanted to overtake the person overtaking you? Seriously, i cant stress enough, as somebody who drives on motorways for a living, how ANGRY middle lane drivers make me. 

Another reason is its usually late at night that people hog the middle lane, so if i have to overtake you on the right hand side and you decide to fall asleep and swerve, where have i got left to go? No where, probably dead. If you were in the left land and i this happened, i would have the fast lane to be able to avoid you, and if i was to drift into your lane, you would have the hard shoulder to use for safety (not that you would catch me drifting). 

This may sound dramatic but i assure you ive seen this happen so many times and i watch out for it every single time i overtake any vehicle.

GET OUT OF THE MIDDLE LANE. UNLESS YOURE OVERTAKING YOU HAVE NO GOOD REASON TO BE THERE. Stop endangering other motorists.

You also get 250MG of webspace, if that's the sort of thing that floats your boat, which I've been using to run a couple of websites with no problems. Moreover they have a forum, which is another good sign I always think. And they are a British company too :) I pay 14.99 a month.

# BARCLAYS MIS-SELLING 

**Battle of Medway**

THE fall-out from one of the boom era's many scandals — the mis-selling of ""interest rate swaps"" — repeats a familiar pattern: a bank refusing to face the full consequences of its actions, and a supposedly independent Big 4 accountancy firm stepping in to protect the bank rather than the small business that has been shafted.

Back in 2006 Rochester-based Port Medway Marina was a successful and expanding boat mooring and repair business with a three-stage development plan that by the following year was on track, with planning permissions obtained, and clear demand from a thriving boating trade, for its improved facilities.

As the credit crunch bit, however, the company's bank, Barclays, refused to extend credit and Port Medway had to find alternative lenders. The snag was that in 2006 the company had signed an ""interest rate swap"" as a condition of its financing from Barclays, locking the company into high, long-term interest rates and costing it more than £2,000 a month. Buying itself out of this deal would have cost a prohibitive £200,000, so the company struggled on, feeding its bankers and reining in its business plan.

When, following exposure of widespread interest rate swap mis-selling in 2012, Port Medway complained about its treatment, Barclays initially denied any wrongdoing. But following the start of legal proceedings and in the wake of wider concerns about the swaps (which regulators say were mis-sold in 90 percent of cases and for which Britain's banks have set aside £3bn in compensation, of which Barclays accounts for around £850m), the bank agreed to a full ""tear-up"" of the mis-sold product.

By this stage Port Medway Marina boss David Taylor and his advisers had taken a hard look at the consequences of the rip-off. Without the excessive monthly payments, or if alternative finance had been available by cancelling them, they concluded, the expansion plan would have been completed and the value of his business would have soared. In such circumstances, the Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA) guidance on dealing with cases of mis-sold rate swaps provides for compensation for ""consequential losses"" to be negotiated between the bank and the customer.

Yet Mr Taylor's claim, for around £700,000, has been rejected by the bank out of hand. It refuses to consider a mountain of legal and forensic accountancy analysis showing the reasonableness of the claim based on the work that had been done and the clear effect of the loss of cash flow because of the swap. In one recorded discussion, a Barclays ""customer review director"" told Taylor the claim was ""hypothetical"" and ""largely subjective"" — which is the nature of consequential loss claims. The usual banking strong-arm tactics are evident, too. Even though it accepts its role in mis-selling interest rate swaps, Barclays says that if Port Medway rejects its offer simply to refund the payments and pursues a consequential loss claim, it will charge the swap payments that have been suspended since 2012. In other words, it will reinstate the costs of a mis-sold product!

Port Medway should have been able to turn to the ""independent reviewer"" of swap cases, appointed by the FCA. But this is none other than accountancy firm KPMG, which earns millions from Barclays as one of its preferred administrators when a borrower gets into trouble. KPMG, again without considering the evidence provided by Port Medway, has agreed that Barclays' offer complies with what the FCA expects.

We also can't forget that if we are getting him, we must also most definately get someone else such as Welbeck because isn't he going off to the African Cup of Nations so we won't have a backup aside from Kone, seeing as Naisy is most likely Barkley's stand in until wherever he comes back, and I honestly don't trust Kone very much. 

If Eto'o comes I'll welcome him as a valuable member of the squad but if not well I'm not going to be totally crushed. I'd like to have Welbeck though and I'd be disappointed if we can't get him in all honesty.

true,Throne3d,eng-somerset,Somerset,"I believe that the main points of ""regurgitation of data"" is aimed at GCSEs. They are almost completely regurgitation in the subjects which allow it, or in the other ones it's ""learn the method specific to this. Use this method, always."", or at least that's what it's like nowadays. Even in the sciences, which should be all about the scientific method of how to collect results correctly, there only seems to be regurgitation, especially for the unit 1 (and 2?) papers, with a bunch of knowledge which you will probably never use, never need to use, and will probably forget as soon as possible (something about nickel and 60°C comes to mind - that's either hardening oils or something to do with ""cracking""... I think the former).

A levels, I've been assured, are much better (and I'm just going into them so I really, *really* hope they are), and also much more difficult (which should be good as it means it'll be more of an in-depth study... Hopefully...). However, GCSEs at the very least are not particularly taxing on the *application* of things, but rather the *memorisation* of things (generally useless or not particularly useful facts). They are important, of course, to know, especially if you're going to be working in those sorts of fields, but I think the methods are a lot more important in a wide variety of subjects.

Oh, and the English (Literature?) GCSE seems to be complete rubbish. Regurgitate complicated words which might apply, and lie through your teeth saying ""X"" is evidence for ""Y"", even if you honestly think there is no link between X and Y whatsoever.

Sure, the education system is better than a lot of countries, I'm sure, and it's good at and past A levels, so I'm told, but GCSEs really don't seem to be based on learning a topic, but instead memorising facts to the best of your ability (and learning how to pass the test).

true,Hiding_behind_you,yorkshire,From Essex to Yorkshire,"&gt; Banks again. Direct debits? Fees for no funds available? WTF? If I do not have money in my account, then do not send the bloody transfer, and let me handle that with my other provider. You're here just to execute my orders, not to bloody educate me on how to handle personal finances. Zero means zero, not ""let's try to send it, apply for automatic overdraft, then punish you with a fee because we think you do not deserve it"".

OK, so Direct Debits.  From your perspective, you are allowing a company to directly take money from your account.  You are the Destination of their, the Originator, instruction.  So, for example, you first allow *""Sexy Elks in Lingerie Magazine Ltd""* to take money from your account by providing them with your bank account details.  Sexy Elks in Lingerie Magazine Ltd then issue an AUDDIS (AUtomated Direct Debit Instruction Service) instruction to BACS so that BACS knows that collected money has to go into Sexy Elk's bank account (Lets say, at HSBC).

Each week/month/quarter/year, Sexy Elks in Lingerie Magazine Ltd issues an instruction to BACS to collect £23.99 from your account at NatWest as well as all their other subscribers who use Barclays, Lloyds, etc.  Now, at no point does Sexy Elks in Lingerie Magazine Ltd  know how much money is in your account - the assumption is that you will have money in your account because you know you have an on-going mandate with Sexy Elks in Lingerie Magazine Ltd for them to collect £23.99 on or around the 'x' of each month.  If, when Sexy Elks in Lingerie Magazine Ltd attempts to collect their monthly subscription fees from your account you have insufficient funds available they will receive an ARUDD (Advice of Returned Unpaid Direct Debits) report from BACS to advise them that the collection from your account has failed, usually with a 'Refer to Payer' (that's you, the payer) message.

Now, Sexy Elks in Lingerie Magazine Ltd has to contact you, which takes time and money, to discover whether you want to pay for this months magazine via an alternative method, or whether to cease sending their publication to you.

Now, at any time you can cancel your subscription to Sexy Elks in Lingerie Magazine, in which case the Originator (Sexy Elks in Lingerie Magazine Ltd) will receive an ADDACS (Automated Direct Debit Amendment and Cancellation Service) report to tell them that you've cancelled your DD mandate, and thus for Sexy Elks in Lingerie Magazine Ltd to cease attempting to collect from your account, and to stop sending their fine publication to you in that brown A4 envelope you look forward to getting through the post.

TL/DR; the Originator has to believe that you, as the Destination, has available funds for them to collect, and if you don't it causes the Originator extra work to either reinstate you, or collect outstanding payments.

true,circuitology,eng-kent,Kent,"&gt;1\. Banks. To open a current account was way too tricky.

Oh yes. Even if you live here your whole life you might find it difficult to open a current account if you don't have a good credit history - which baffles me, considering you're not asking them to lend you anything!

&gt;2\. Banks again. Direct debits? Fees for no funds available? WTF?

Don't get me started... Recently I was moving some money around between accounts and didn't realise I had a direct debit going out for a credit card payment the next day. The DD ""bounced"" and I was charged £12 by the card company and then £10 by the bank. I made sure I immediately paid the money manually to the card company, before the day it was due, so it wasn't late or anything. £22 of my money for an honest mistake and it cost the companies *absolutely nothing* - well the cost of an automatically generated letter, which certainly isn't close to that.

&gt;3\. Cheques. Who the hell uses cheques? It's XXI century.

Cheques are useful if you don't totally trust the person or you need to send payments by post.

&gt;7\. Parking. I love British parking!

Really? I have to wonder where you are that you actually like the parking situation. Here in Kent it's a nightmare - there's hardly anywhere to park for free, even outside your own house a lot of the time - there are parking zones that you have to pay a yearly fee to get a permit for, to park outside your own front door!

&gt;8\. No, I won't be mentioning double taps.

As in bathroom taps? Honestly it baffles me as well. We have a mixer tap in our kitchen but separate taps in the bathroom - WTF? 

&gt;14\. David Cameron. The manipulative, populistic, clueless prick.

Well said.

&gt;15\. Education.

Well, just remember that it's not the teachers' fault. We rely far too much on some really weird metrics to figure out how well kids are doing in school.

&gt;16\. Self-service cash registers. I love them.

I love them too. I guess people don't like the idea of a real person being out of a job to be replaced by a machine...but this is the future, we must adapt.

&gt;17\. Almost no road police, no portable speed cameras that can be set up in any random place... and people generally drive nice, calm, and within the road code. Love it.

Okay...seriously?? Now I must know where you live. The opposite is true around here, to be honest.

true,cefor,cnty-wales,Gwynedd,"The difficulty in English Literature exams is the subjective nature of literature. One person can think something completely different to you and still be 100% correct in their view of the text.

If you went on to do Literature at A-Level or Degree level, you'd find that a much bigger emphasis is on personal interpretation and application of critical theory to a text in order to find your personal interpretation.

At Uni, if I can use critical theory to justify what I'm saying, I get the mark (I'm not studying Literature, but the essays we write are in a similar vein).

The way the world is going, we no longer need to memorise anything. Not really, when Google is sitting in your pocket. I think that's a good thing. We can focus on teaching kids to apply critical thinking and problem solving to tasks.

Of course, there is an issue with kids that don't want to learn because they think they don't need to, or because they can't be bothered or something else equally stupid and frustrating to hear.

Anyway, before this goes on a bigger tangent... the Literature issues are because there needs to be a way (in the Govt's eyes) to certify a particular level of competence in English Literature, which means that there has to be a way of examining that competence that will work for the whole country.

Because the price of something has fallen is not a good reason to immediately buy something - you need to question why. Whats the long term upside for it? Is it near to the office buildings in Leeds? What's Leeds' future? Is it close to transportation? How far is it from groceries for example? If it's a flat, does it come with parking?

You're buying blind, and it might be genius, but more likely it's a disaster. A visit will help, but it won't abate all those concerns entirely.

Also, dont forget taxation. You'll be paying 20? 40?% tax on the income. I've been thinking about this in depth lately, too, and I'm more focused on the long term capital growth rather than the income, myself.

Which makes no sense to me.  It's not like she didn't know what happens.  Hell she's been in the same room with three incarnations of the doctor, one of whom was very old already.  Beyond that she's been into his past and has met every single incarnation of the Doctor.  I'm not buying the whole massive struggle to accept a new Doctor thing.  I'm just not.

Moffat's projecting everyone's fear of a new doctor onto her, and in a purely plot sense it doesn't work.  It's also completely unnecessary.  I don't need to be reminded I should accept a new Doctor, and I certainly don't need the plot being dragged down with that reminder.

No the phone call was so all the children could see Matt Smith say it's OK to like the new doctor which frankly insults their intelligence.  10 didn't have to come on and say ""hey I know I'm a ridiculously popular doctor, but please give 11 a chance"" and the kids had no problem with accepting 11.  When the show rebooted we didn't need 4 to come out and be like ""nah man you can accept this guy, it's cool."" for all the old school Who fans.

No beyond the incredibly weak writing and lackluster performance of the phone call, it was simply unnecessary.  Unnecessary and did damage to the plot and character of Clara.

Also, I want to point out, unless the council tax is paid for by landlord (unusual but not so unusual I guess), the NET yield on this is approx 8.5% - that's pretty high. I would suggest it implies that a fall or flat valuation is priced in to the long-term of the property.

When I shared this with one of my friends, a die-hard football fan, he told me that they were a potential candidate for relegation every year, and it would be that much harder to find their games for viewing if they went down that road again. 

I then asked him for some teams that were always mid-table or higher (for the sake of being able to watch the matches for at least the next few years), but also didn't want these trillionare-owned teams that simply bought everything.  He gave me Everton and Tottenham as the best choices, but also recommended a few other squads.  After doing some research, as well as bouncing questions off him I settled for Tottenham, simply because they traditionally played fast, and I figured I'd enjoy that more.  That, on top of being sold on Eriksen/Lamela/Dier as up-and-comers, and that made my choice easy.

My friend still gives me flack for choosing Tottenham over Everton, but as I continue to learn more about the club I'm happy I settled on Spurs over West Brom pre-season.  The torturous history combined with the chance to watch a young team grow will be a hell of a ride, one way or another!

true,hamlet9000,mcgann,McGann,"&gt; it did not throw the past out of whack, it worked fine.

Actually, it was just the final nail confirming that the entire Silence arc-plot made no sense whatsoever.

Let's review: The Silence are established as having created a vast network of tunnels beneath the surface of the Earth and secretly ruling humanity for centuries. Okay. Later you reveal that the Silence are actually just genetically modified priests loyal to Kovarian and their only purpose on Earth was to raise Melody Pond. So Madame Kovarian decided the most efficient way to get control of an orphanage in Florida in the 1960s was to have the Silence secretly rule over mankind for hundreds of years? And then, when they needed a space suit, the only way Kovarian -- who, it should be noted, has also been established as controlling an entire fleet of papal soldiers with *spaceships* -- can think of to get a spacesuit is to literally create the U.S.-Russia space race?

The ""revelation"" that the Silence were always working for Kovarian was the lynchpin that turned the entire Silence arc-plot into utter nonsense.

(The arc-plot had already received a pretty hefty body blow in the form of Kovarian's assassination plan being revealed as total nonsense a season earlier: She goes through vast efforts to kidnap Melody. She employs huge machinations to raise her as a psychopathic killer. But then her assassination plan has nothing to do with her being Melody or River or a Time Lord. Instead, River is put into a spacesuit, teleported to a random location, and then forced to shoot the Doctor. None of that makes any sense even before we get to the fixed point that's a fixed point because it's a fixed point but it's not actually a fixed point nonsense and deus ex machina that Moffat used to ""resolve"" that plot.)",0,1408994295,null,0,false,0,ck077ch,t3_2eh56b,t1_ck077ch,t1_cjzqtwv,null,1427363610,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

true,DuckMagic,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country (West Brom),"&gt;Education. I admit that, my stepson is not the brightest star in the galaxy. Or wasn't. Until he came here. From the worst student in his class, he stepped up to one the best in his year. While knowing nothing. I know, I've been testing his knowledge before his GCSEs. The kids here do not have to do anything. They have almost no requirements. They do not have to improve. They seem to have no concept of self-improvement at all! A girl from my stepson's class was saying that she doesn't have to learn, as she will finish the school, will have a baby, and will get money and housing from the council. So, is that a reason for points 10, 13 and 14? And if yes, is that intentional?

I was barely in the middle of my class of 30 back in Latvia, then shot up right to the top when my parents brought me over at age 10. Ended up finishing with 10 A-A* GCSEs and 8 equivalents (BTEC, Nationals...). I'd say that GCSEs were piss easy for me. A-levels is where you start having to put in real effort, but I still finished top of the Sixth Form, and I am baffled by how many people struggle to achieve a pass at either level. And yet, I wouldn't consider myself exceptionally smart. I even think of myself as somewhat intellectually inferior to some of my friends with significantly worse results (Gs and Fs, and so on) than myself. More than anything, GCSE are a reflection on how effective your revision system and memory are, with a positive effect on your actual critical thinking/ wisdom if you put some thought into your work beyond memorising facts. A-levels take some real effort and are actually challenging. 

One thing I would like to disagree with is the notion of ""kids not having to do anything/ not having any homework"" that is popular among Eastern European immigrant-parents. I was fed this lie prior to coming to the UK, and much annoyed by it being repeated by my parents for years. There is a plenty of homework given to British schoolchildren, and although it may not be as intense as what I experienced as a school kid in Latvia, it is enough to give you enough self discipline and extra practice outside of lesson, if you choose to do it. And put some effort in.

The biggest difference between the two education systems I've experienced is that there is a bigger workload in Latvia, and you get serious consequences, mostly in the form of a parent giving you a beating.",0,1408994522,null,0,1408995354,0,ck07bqd,t3_2ej1zf,t1_ck07bqd,t3_2ej1zf,null,1427363553,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

&gt;

&gt;__Frosted glass__ is produced by the [sandblasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandblasting) or [acid etching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_etching) of clear sheet [glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass). It has the effect of rendering the glass [translucent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translucent) by [scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering) of light during transmission, thus [blurring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Appearance) images while still transmitting light.

&gt;Applications:

&gt;


&gt;* To obtain visual privacy while admitting light.

&gt;* Decorative patterns may be imposed upon otherwise plain glass by using wax or other resist to retain [transparent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(optics\)) areas.

&gt;* Frosted glass in [light bulbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_bulb) is used for evenly distributing the light from the bulb's filament across its surface area.

&gt;* To distribute light uniformly in a photographic [contact printer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_printer).

&gt;* To create an airtight seal in tubes.

&gt;The frosted glass effect can also be achieved by the application of vinyl film, used as a sort of stencil on the glass surface. ""Photo-resist"", or photo-resistant film is also available, which can be produced to mask off the area surrounding a decorative design, or logo on the glass surface. A similar effect may also be accomplished with the use of canned frosted glass sprays.

If anything the personnel shrinkage in finance and banking over the past 6 years would have bumped up productivity because the chaff would have been cut away leaving the more profitable aspects of banking.

Another factor is that with the influx of cheap labour from abroad of all kinds (skilled, unskilled, graduates etc.) it allows companies to get bums on seats but not necessarily give them the tools to do their job well.

true,grollcool,null,null,"&gt; . It is also unfair to say we ""sacraficed"" Sturridge and Lukaku

Yeah we didn't sacrifice them, we just let Torres be an automatic starter ahead of both of them virtually blocking them both out of the first team...

Seriously, its absolutely silly to deny that us favoring Torres led to the sale of Sturrdige and ultimately the sale of Lukaku. If Torres wasn't guaranteed a start, Lukaku and Sturridge would both have been our top choice.

Everybody likes a bargain, there is no shame in picking one up if you see one. Aggression and grabbiness aren't acceptable. In our local shop people are painfully polite, you sometimes see a bunch of builders stood around the reduced pies, not wanting to be the first to pick in case they take something someone else wanted.

I tend to be quite selective, I only get things which have a very good reduction and are likely to still be edible. Things that you are going to cook - steak, smoked bacon, but not fish or pork. Pudding, cream, cheese are usually OK, I would risk pate or cooked meats. In the past I've wasted money buying things that I decided against eating when I opened the pack and it didn't smell good.

it looks like the population of leeds hasnt really shifted anywhere in the last 60 years - that would be a worrying thing to me, especially if theres been substantial development in the city centre (i.e. new apartment blocks and so on).

If you're looking for long term capital increases, the questions to ask yourself are:

1 - Location? Is it a nice part of leeds or is it a slum? A £100k premier one-bed apartment in the city centre next to the offices will be worth a lot more in 5-10 years than a £100k 3 bedroom house outside the city centre 15 minutes walk from the nearest bus stop.

2 - What is the future? Are the universit(ies) expanding? What is the primary make up of that expansion - local or international? Very different spending portfolios

3 - What is the recent history of Leeds? London is obviously undergoing a huge boom at the moment, Liverpool is being heavily invested in, Manchester I'm not so certain about... What's happening in Leeds? How much does it stand to benefit from HS3 and East/West links? Is there any substantial plans (£1b+)? Stratford is a great example in London of somewhere that went from dump to great over a few years. Significant investment, joined the Tube, £1b+ on new developments, shopping centre, etc. You could have easily done 4x original investment there, and still soaring.

Why *Leeds*, is the question to really ask?

And as I said, I'm completely ignorant of all things Leeds, so I have no idea, I can't say it's a good idea or a bad idea. But remember, this decision could be worth (say) £30-50k to you, if you make the right one.

true,Caprylate,null,null,"My understanding is the Rightmove sold prices is what the Land Registry has it reported as. Pop the postcode LS9 8LB (the property from the Rightmove link posted in reply to someone else) into http://www.rightmove.co.uk/house-prices.html here and you can see the sold prices of those relative new builds. Worth roughly half compared to when they were built and first sold around 2006/2007. 

To me it seems that Leeds just seems cheap because the recovery in London prices hasn't spread anywhere near as North yet. Leeds as a place to work seems to have a fairly good size IT sector and other big industries.

Because I'm targeting 1 mile radius of the city centre and they are relatively new builds, it's walking distance to the centre and is less impacted by other new builds pushing existing property prices down further.

The location to decent transport links and shops within say a 10 minute walk is definitely something to look further into, part of the appeal is the proximity to the centre makes it walking distance although the flat did have allocated parking too.

Currently only a 20% tax rate payer, they're a bit more lousy as an income stream at 40% but as I don't need it as an income, what I would do is chuck most/all the profit into a SIPP to reclaim the 40% if/when I reach that tax rate.

Capital growth seems like a safer bet if buying a London BTL or something close enough to commute to London, but I feel if buying somewhere far enough away that it's too risky chasing capital growth and it's better to focus on maximising the rental percentages. 

Looking at Leeds from a bit of Googling and it definitely doesn't seem like a city that is in decline and seems to be a bit on the up. The other location idea was Manchester, a bit of the capital growth there has already happened due to the BBC moving up there but it seems like a safer bet than Leeds, although as you would expect, slightly less profitable on percentage basis than my Leeds example. 

Location is absolutely something I need to look into more but initial Googling, both Leeds and Manchester seem like fairly decent options.

The other option is basically to park the cash in a Santander 123 account as I'd be able to max out the 20k but my maths makes the BTL idea sound way more profitable and with my current job, it's viable to move outside of London to either Leeds or Manchester, remortgage the BTL into a capital and interest residential mortgage.

I would say the main concerns are locking up the cash in something illiquid, if the maths vs reality differ too much (research and visting the area seem like a way to solve this concern) and a nightmare tenant (hopefully this concern is reduced by targeting the DINKs - double income, no kids applicants who would likely target a 1 bed flat).

true,Baggzio,newcr-1,You Signed Lambert We Signed No One At All!!,"1. Naisy by far (who'd have thought we'd be saying that 2 seasons ago)
2. I don't think I would, I'd love if we can establish a Kev/McGeady partnership this season, I think if we can establish McGeady on the left that'll be our best option.
3. Hoping 5th but realistically 6th or 7th with a cup, hopefully we stay in Europe because I think it'll do wonders for players like Barkley, Coleman and McCarthy
4. It's definitely a combo of the 3 but bad tactics have been shown by the subs made, I think Besic should've been brought on the 2 games for Barry but that's just my opinion.

I think we need the traditional Rom up top and Naisy behind him, works the best for all parties instead of trying to cater for just one or the other.

As I said earlier I think if we can get McGeady out left with Kev on the right we will be onto a winner both class out and out wingers. Pienaar more of a central player for me now due to his lost pace.

I think as Rom and Naisy play more they'll get a better understanding of each other and link up better, also Kev and Rom also had great link up last year so as Kev gets fully back into the swing of things we will see that partnership again.

I think Welbeck would be a good solid option to buy for a backup, he's also versatile and isn't up his own arse enough to demand a starting spot.

Although there are a lot of shouts for CBs over the past week, I'd love if in the cup games Stones and Duffy were the partnership, as my flair suggests, I enjoy watching Shane Duffy and I'd love for him to make it here I think he just needs a chance. We also have that young Galloway lad who's apparently quality so he could be another young player given a chance under Bobby.

I hated Chemistry at GCSE. I only took it at A-level because I wanted to do Biology afterwards. Turned out Biology was a crock of memorising shite, and Chemistry was cool. Just heading into my Master's year of a Chemistry degree now :D there are a few things you need to ""learn"", and then it's all about developing your understanding. Organic Chemistry is a lot of fun at A-level! I did OCR, but they don't really differ that much. The practical assessments are kind of shitty/boring and in no way prepare you for any practical work in the future. 

Spanish was amazing. It's difficult man, but you'll see your proficiency just jump. It starts off really, really difficult, but after Christmas I think you'll feel it easing off as you get into it and get more confident. Much work, much reward. I didn't do much work for my other subjects, but I did for Spanish, and it still kicked my ass. I got skills out of it though, well worth doing.

Maths is pretty straight forward (AQA). Further is just... more. If you like Maths (which I gather you do with those choices) then you'll probably be fine.

Second episode that doesn't fit in the DW Universe is [The Next Doctor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Next_Doctor).

true,RifleEyez,null,null,"&gt;I think he still has a role to play and I'll be as disappointed selling him as I was when we sold Caulker.

Agreed. Same with Livermore. People say I hate on Townsend unnecessarily, but my point with him is we don't have that luxury of a 10-15m squad player sat on the bench. He's great as an impact player, but he's been given a run and didn't produce. Even Chadli, who I considered just *solid* has shown his worth already this season. He's scored more than Townsend did in 25 in that single game. 

It's very rare a player in that position (bar a position change, needing to settle or a huge injury - none apply to him) drastically improves after 23 - so sell, upgrade. Our academy is for producing a profit and not just holding onto the hope that *maybe next season will be his year* - I would rather see 10-15m (quoted range) put towards a AML *with* end product and a higher ceiling and another prospect bought in Bentaleb style than see his value plummet if he has another soso season (which is likely). That's happened with Lennon now - Lennon at 18, 19, 20? Could have fetched a similar price - he set the EPL on fire in some games and broke the ankles of a LOT of LB's in his time, like Evra/Clichy. 

Same with Livermore, same with Caulker, same with Huddlestone, Lennon, Dawson (arguably Lennon/Hudd/Dawson were Leeds/Derby/Forest academy players, but the point remains). We're at a point where we're missing out on the CL marginally, by a few points, and it's just not helping the club as a WHOLE keeping these players for nothing more than sentimental value.

true,MatthewWilkes,eng-Bristol,Brizzle,"&gt; Banks. To open a current account was way too tricky

Yeah. Ostensibly about money-laundering. I don't understand it either.

&gt; Banks again. Direct debits? Fees for no funds available?

Banks are greedy, they apply fees for everything until they get told it's illegal. Then they apply more. There shouldn't be fees for standing orders. Direct debits are different, they represent an outside contract, you're expected to not sign up for one that you can't afford. They're required to inform you well in advance of any change to the amount they're billing you.

&gt; Cheques. Who the hell uses cheques? It's XXI century.

Nobody. I haven't used one in years.

&gt; Ill people at work. Well, if you're ill, stay at home, not go to the office barely being able to speak

People are selfish, they think their sick days are more important.

&gt; Tea with milk and chips with vinegar. … I guess I'm assimilated by now.

Yep, assimilated.

&gt; ""Do not hog the right/middle lane"". OK. I get it. But consider that: I'm going on the middle lane, exactly at the speed limit with cruise control set

The lanes in the UK are for overtaking. If there are three lanes then two people can be overtaking at once. You should be in the inside lane unless actively passing a car. Also, other people are selfish assholes. See above.

&gt; Parking. I love British parking! Although it's strange that you just leave cars on the road

Our garages are full of crap.

&gt; No, I won't be mentioning double taps. This horse has been beaten to a pulp.

Neigh.

&gt; But I'll mention the mess people make. WTF? I've once seen three guys in suits in a tube, around 8pm, eating (in a very messy way) some McDonalds meals. And they left all the packaging on the seats when leaving the tube.

These people hate being told off. Tell them off.

&gt; Incompetence in services

Yeah, true. Patronise the places that are competent, it'll encourage them.

&gt; Insure EVERYTHING. Here: car, house, house content, tenant's insurance, professional indemnity, bicycle, animals (small), animals (large, I have a horse), animal's third party insurance, dental

house contents and tenant's are usually the same thing. Tenant's is for the contents you don't own. Prof. Indemnity is a very specific thing for people running a business. The rest are very much optional, work out if you'd like the peace of mind, but it's *unusual*

&gt; I love: train services in my area, always on time and well connected. I hate: train tickets price. WTF, I know someone who spends over 1/3 of his salary just to get to work for a month!

Due to botched nationalisation. Pisses us all off too.

&gt; Daily Mail. Seriously? Who buys this... thing?

It's the world's most popular news source. Fucking idiots.

&gt; David Cameron. The manipulative, populistic, clueless prick. I always thought Polish politicians are the worst, but not anymore.

He's nowhere near the worst.

&gt; Education. I admit that, my stepson is not the brightest star in the galaxy. Or wasn't. Until he came here.

Sounds like he needs a better school. :(

&gt; Self-service cash registers. I love them. But why do I seem to be in a minority?

We dislike people that go always by the book. It makes them sound like robots. A bit of humour and flexibility goes a long way with the British. Machines can't provide that, so are useful only when we're not feeling social.

&gt; Almost no road police, no portable speed cameras that can be set up in any random place... and people generally drive nice, calm, and within the road code

Look at the bikes and the taxis.

&gt; Sour cream is a surprisingly rare thing

Sour cream is available in most small shops, although probably not newsagents.
