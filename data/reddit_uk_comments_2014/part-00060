One could argue that the doctor has, in a butterfly effect, caused an evolutionary jump for the angels. 11 was the cause (or at least at the center) of multiple paradox and multiverse rewrites, causing vast temporal energies to leak into the universe in places they normally wouldn't. 

This would even explain why the angels wanted to so badly to get to the doctor on Trenzalore. Not because they ""hate"" him or want him dead but rather that they now possess an migration instinct to follow the doctor. To feed, and reproduce.

Your best bet is to go on the [AV website](https://apprenticeshipvacancymatchingservice.lsc.gov.uk/navms/Forms/Candidate/Apprenticeships.aspx) and search for what you are looking for, it can be by area/sector/employer/learning provider.  It will give you a load of vacancies and normally a contact number at the bottom.

Now the way it works is the applications come through to someone like me and my first port of call is to fill the vacancy with a 16-18 learner because that is the age group we get most funding from the government for and what gives me the biggest contribution towards my sales target.  The next option is to fill it with a 19-23 learner but this will only give me around 50% of the money so I am less likely to do it.  Until 2 weeks ago 24+ learners had to self-fund and we would get nothing from the government for it, however they have u-turned and now you can get funding for it but as a learning provider we get nothing from the government so we run the qualification at a loss.

So, your best bet of getting an apprenticeship is to apply on AV then phone the person who's number is at the bottom of the add (called an ESO - Employment Support Officer) and try and impress them on the phone.  Your best chance is to get a vacancy not easily accessible by bus so it would be hard for a young person with no car to easily get to or alternatively do something like hospitality which can require candidates to be 18+ in order to serve alcohol.

What is it you are looking to do by the way? What county are you in? Also be aware that the minimum wage for an apprentice in their first year is £2.68 so you are looking at coming out with around £100 per week.

You seem to be scared of being challenged on your very staid positivism. That and you're also wedded to a certain perspective that seem to denote that anyone who disagrees with you is a moron. 

Religion and race can be construed as the same thing. 

Want me to prove it? The colonial administration in India classed people as Hindu, Muslim and Sikh. Not Rajput, punjabi or bangla. This is why you have Hindu Nationalism in the form of the BJP right now. You also had the creation of Pakistan as a MUSLIM country because of this - the actual ethnic boundaries weren't used.

Another example - the French divided  up their mandates in Palestine/Syria according to Christian, Shia Muslim and Sunni Muslim. They split it into Syria and Lebanon so that Lebanon would preserve a Christian majority  - they then made sure the Lebanese constitution reflected this by allocating positions according to Religion. 

Now there are prime example of race and religion being conflated. 

Now you can argue as much as you want that ""it's not a race"" but the reality according to the LEBANESE and the SYRIAN people is that those have no become racial identities as well as religious ones. 

Here's some actual research on race, religion and identity:

Lots of RBS is still profitable, the people in those divisions who do better than their targets deserve their bonus.

The greyer area is with the executives and the people in divisions that have made a loss. Their division _is_ haemorraging money, but there is absolutely _nothing_ that can be done about that, they have a toxic bank and are in the process of cleaning it up.

Should they be inelligible for bonus's until all the bad debt they've been heaped with has left the system? That seems like a really good way to lose anyone competent from that division, why would they stay there when they could get another job in a bank or division that isn't toxic? 

Or should they get a bonus if the bank's losses are lower than projected/targetted? Since that's the only thing they can realistically work towards? I personally think so. They've outperformed what their salary compensates them for, so according to the industry norms they're in line for a bonus.



Whether the system for compensation in the financial sector is sane or not is a completely different matter (I personally think our financial sector incentivises completely the wrong things).


TL;DR: The government has decided it's going to prop RBS up and not let it fail like you're used car sales would. That means it can't shed it's toxic assets by filing for bankruptcy. That mean it _has_ to make a loss until all those debts are gone. RBS's target isn't to make a profit, it's to minimise losses.

Uhh.. Do you mean the completely normal looking woman who was being controlled by something that only looked like a lobster in the sense that it was red from *The Crimson Horror*? And besides, what's wrong with that idea, or the idea of a lobster woman? 

""Cybermen on the moon being destroyed by a black hole?""
Ignoring the fact that again, that only vaguely resembles what happened in the episode, what's wrong with that idea? You personally find that it sounds stupid? I don't see what your point is.

""These are not classic episode stories.""
Uhh... why not? What do you mean? Do you mean that ideas like the monster love story aren't something you'd see in the classic series? 

Now, I'm not against criticism at all, and I agree about the pacing problem with all one-part stories, but your main complaint is that you don't like the overall episode ideas, and it's not the writing you dislike, it's the concepts themselves.

3. Oxford does occasionally have talks. Here is my assessment, if it is any good: More like Harvard than MIT. Some things will be strange, some things will be fantastic, most of the time you just have to be extremely self-motivated and interested in writing a hell of a lot.

I added up your averages (rounding up or down) for everything necessary; food (I set this at £130), savings, bills, petrol, rent,  etc.  I included activities as well, as you said this was for fitness.

IMO, these will be areas that need to be addressed:

* A legit #1 or #2 CB on top of a healthy Sakho 
* Another winger like Konoplyanka to give Sterling a rest
* Another CDM to ease Henderson and Gerrards workload (and I'm talking about on top of Lucas, provide he can stay healthy as well)
* Another LB and another RB (also depending on Enrique)

Some of this will need to be done by going out and buying, and some may potentially be filled within the Club's youth (Ibe, I'm looking at you)

Sherwood just doesn't have the experience and arrogance to get it quickly.

If what I have been hoping for for months is true then maybe Sherwood will stay on as Van Gaal's second.

The fact is that immigration into the UK *is* substantial.  11.3% of people were born outside of the UK, of which 7.3% come from outside of the EU  ([Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_the_United_Kingdom_since_Irish_independence)).  There are indeed nations with higher immigrant populations, but it's not much consolation to point out that you can always find somewhere worse.

Feel free to use arguments in support of the claim that immigration is a good thing, but don't pretend that there's not a sizable number of immigrants at the moment.

So of course, there's the inevitable charge that people opposed to immigration are 'little Englanders' and probably racist.  And you're right, probably some of those complaining are - but at the same time people have a perfect right to debate this issue and resorting to name-calling just isn't good enough anymore. You actually have to come up with an argument *why* you think immigration is a good thing and understand that not everyone who thinks a figure of 11.3% might be too high is a fascist/racist/insert your own slur.

And I've got to wonder - at what point would you think it acceptable for people to start writing comments against immigration?  20%?  50%?

When he went I was so ready to experience that again with Smith. For me it never happened. There was a huge tonal change in the show, the first smith series is very childs fantasy with horrible visual cues and bad foreshadowing. It felt to me like I was being treated like an idiot. 

Moffat is the writer, go back and watch ""The Impossible Girl"" Now you can expect that style for the entire season, but less restrained. You can also expect more forced memes and meta references. They can occasionally feel forced. 

Now a lot of people talk about River. I personally hate what they do with her. There is this terrible status play that comes into the show with it. In the library episodes she was likable, that aspect quickly goes and is replaced with foreshadowing and upstaging until she becomes obsolete. There are twists, I personally saw them coming, however in a binge session they may be less obvious. 

The graphics and quality of the sets, props and video are much higher then before. So thats a plus but a lot of the time the writing is not as intelligent as you may have come to expect. Expect less filler episodes, as many of them are related to a direct over arching plot, and expect most of the ones that aren't to have at least something connected to it.

My personal favorite episode of Smiths was ""The Doctors Wife"" it is a brilliant little stand aloneish episode that was very well written and created a quaint new dynamic. 

Matt Smith however does a brilliant job with what he has. Towards the beginning he can seem just like an older brother running around the place and a little unprepared. However he does grow into the role. Though you can expect to think to yourself ""wait, the Doctor can do that now?!"" at least once or twice during his run. (often it is never seen or mentioned again...)

TO be honest, I think if the economy collapses, humanity will find some way through. It would be quite tragic, and lots of people would die, but we'd get through it somehow. If the environment collapses, however.... game over, insert coin. Therefore, I think it's far more important to be looking for ways to sustain the environment rather than the economy. We can always change the economic model and adapt our construct to allow for the monetary losses.

That's what most people don't seem to get. All this debt... it's not some force of nature that all people are inevitably bound by. It's a human invention, and therefore humans can change how it works, or get rid of it altogether.

Prioritising economy over environment is like sitting in quicksand, and just saying calmly to the panicking significant other 'not now, dear, I'm watching the tennis'

Prioritising environment over economy is also bad, but it's not somewhere we haven't been before. People starving while the shops are full of food.... that's economic strife.

John Hurt was good but didn't quite seem to be the Doctor.  However, this could easily be written off by the context of him being the Doctor that fought in the time war and having to do so many things contrary to his beliefs.  The contrast between him and the two newer Doctors worked quite well though.

I suspect Capaldi will be very good, though I also suspect he will raise the ire of people who think he's too old and behaves a bit too differently.

It took Sir Alex three years to get on their legendary run.  It's time to accept that run is over and rebuilding takes time.  It's also true that they are no longer a cut above all the other clubs in terms of money and football quality.  Your 'noisy neighbours', Chelsea, Arsenal, etc have all substantially closed the gap.  

Moyes could be negative with us - but usually it's when he perceived a gulf in class between us and the opposition.  This isn't an issue with the ManU team sheet.  I haven't followed ManU super closely but I don't think he's had that negative attitude in many if any games with you.  

Instead, he's trying to adapt the team and rebuild it.  I would give him the coming off-season and a few extra signings.  He might have to fire a few of the egos who aren't buying into Manchester United so much as the glory and rebuild the dressing room and its mood too.    

But I will be disappointed if Moyes is fired.   Because I think ManU is better than that.  They aren't the panicking club that throws buckets at every problem to make it go away asap.  They don't do expensive patch work jobs.  Moyes doesn't do that either.   ",0,1393651859,null,0,false,0,cfrjqis,t3_1z8nt7,t1_cfrjqis,t3_1z8nt7,null,1432608867,15,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,15

We need a lot of players though, I've said for a long time now we can't rely on SAS forever. At some point when they aren't firing on all cylinders we will need the defence and midfield to help grind out a 1-0. I'd love M'Vila to come in and join the midfield corps. Especially with Suso coming back, between CM and DM we would have some nice options. Then Kroos too fingers crossed...

We probably need a solid CB to play alongside Sakho more than anything though and I also don't think Agger will be happy playing 2nd fiddle so he could be leaving. Ilori could be a decent squad player next year too. I'd love to sign Papadopolous but his injury record isn't the most inspiring. There are other options like Lovren, Hummels, Subotic, Howedes to look at also. A dark horse could be Caulker. I really rate him and he'd be pretty good next to Sakho in my opinion.

Then we need full backs too. Enrique and Johnson/Flanno can do a job but if we really want to build we have to upgrade massively. Alex Sandro, Shaw, Rodriguez, Coentrao, De Sciglio, Montoya?

Finally I think a backup striker is in order. Look back at most of Fergie's United teams, they all had 4 strikers of at least good quality if not great - Cole, Yorke, Sheringham, Ole Gunnar; Rooney, Tevez, Ronaldo, Berbatov; Rooney, RVP, Hernandez, Welbeck. We could do with one more player to add to Suarez, Sturridge and Borini. Aspas looks like a goner.

 Single sex schools tend to be exclusive in some way - they either have religious requirements, they're grammar schools, or they're just in a posh area. And this means that more of their students get a lot of support or encouragement from  their parents, and so they do well.

 This gets a feedback loop going and means other supportive parents want to send their children there.

you cant have it both ways, either you are responsible enough to have input or you need to be molly coddled and your input should count for nothing.

Why does your prejudice mean that I'm not free to do what I like in a pub?  Have you been in a pub lately?  They aren't filled with incoherent drunks.  There are possibly a few late on Saturday night.  Your instant reaching for the statute book means that all the people who, through their own volition, have had two or three pints, are perfectly mentally equipped to decide how they would like to enjoy their earnings, are then subject to your whims about what constitutes their mental capacity.

By your argument, anyone in a pub is not mentally able to make the decision about whether they can have another drink.  Ergo, they could never get drunk, ergo they are mentally able to decide that they can play gambling games, or have another drink.

We do not need more infanticising laws.  Adults make choices.  They're not all good, I grant you, but in a free country, provided you damage no one but yourself, you should be free to make those bad choices.

&gt; Make available on the NHS complementary medicines that are cost-effective and have been shown to work.

Which is precisely none of them. Or they would be medicine. Not alternative treatments (there are no such thing as ""complementary medicines"").

They wish to waste money on things that don't work instead of investing in treatments and research which does. That will literally cost lives.

They also seem to buy into a popular conspiracy theory:
&gt; More NHS dental care rather than the mass fluoridation of drinking water.

showing, in my view, that they really don't understand what [flouridation is and how it works](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/fluoride/Pages/Introduction.aspx).

Personally, I think that flouridation is not needed these days (but deflouridation may be; I don't know if that's needed anywhere in the UK), but that's got nothing to do with NHS treatment; it's to do with flouride in toothpaste, which everyone can afford.

So they want to spend money sending people to dentists so that they don't have to clean their teeth properly?

That policy right there is totally bonkers.

Thank you for providing the link but I'm going to make an assumption based on the article here: 

* As 'affluent neighbors' are reported to find quitting easier than less affluent ones, it would imply that finances and a sense of well-being drawn from that position of wealth play a key part. 

* However, genetically, both must be similar enough - the problem lies in the mind and not in the body. 

* Therefore the disparity must arise due social and economical differences - the added pressure of daily life for those less affluent means they find a 'crutch' in the form of smoking and the relief it brings to be more necessary. 

* This is still a matter of willpower however, as smoking itself is a costly habit that might otherwise allow less affluent parties to become better off financially through less expenditures / more savings. 

I would still argue then that it's very much a case of willpower and remains down to the individual to assess their situation and make a sensible decision. 

For example - when I know that money is tight and I have bills to pay at the end of my month, I don't go out and drink or spend money on leisure - I save it until I can go out again. The pressure might still be there from colleagues or friends or whatever - but I know where to draw the line for myself.

Being locked up doesn't bother me that much because I've previously done two and a half years in a secure hospital (for breach of the peace and breach of bail) plus I'm autistic so I tend to spend a lot of time by myself anyway, but anyone who thinks prison is a fucking holiday camp is completely fucking bonkers. 

Having a tv and being able to smoke and so on make it bearable and the food is better than what I got in hospital but if you're on remand then you're utterly dependent on friends and family for money as your benefits are stopped automatically when you're remanded (although they're re-instated and backdated if you make bail or are acquitted) and most of the guys inside have partners/family who are on benefits themselves so they can't afford to help them out. Plus, if you're remanded it's difficult to get a prison job and you don't get paid a cell wage whilst you're on remand.

At Saughton nick you only get twenty tea bags in your weekend pack which have to last you a week.

Personally, I suspect that for a lot of the guys in the jail it's the only actual structure that makes sense in their lives plus there are rules that are enforced equitably which whilst at times arbitrary aren't capricious.

Fortunately, as I'm in Scotland I'm not subject to Chris Grayling's insane changes to privileges such as denying people tellies which seem intended to drive people fucking crazy. Torturing people is not going to change them into model citizens and what most of the guys inside really need is decent levels of after-care and support you get if you've been in a secure hospital rather than poverty-level benefits and half an hour with a probation officer who can't do shit for you when you're out. But that costs a lot of money that people don't want their taxes spent on even though it's a false economy. 

The fact that recidivism rates for those released from prison are approx 60% whereas for those released from medium secure hospitals are about 16% shows that if you're prepared to make the investment and provide the support then you'll get the results. Plus the secure hospitals really are like a fucking holiday camp - they're very much the Daily Mail image of prison - yet people who've been in them are far less likely to re-offend.

It's illegal to drive when drunk, it's illegal to to a great many other things whilst drunk. Why should it be legal to gamble your life savings when drunk?

Think about it, you can get arrested for rape because she was too drunk to provide consent, but it's completely A-OK to trick somebody into putting their life savings on a 1 in 1000 odds bet when they're drunk?


&gt; Why does your prejudice mean that I'm not free to do what I like in a pub? 

You are, what is this prejudice you speak of?


&gt;Have you been in a pub lately? They aren't filled with incoherent drunks. There are possibly a few late on Saturday night. Your instant reaching for the statute book means that all the people who, through their own volition, have had two or three pints, are perfectly mentally equipped to decide how they would like to enjoy their earnings, are then subject to your whims about what constitutes their mental capacity.

They can still play on a gambling machine, just not one that has such a ridulously high stake.


&gt; By your argument, anyone in a pub is not mentally able to make the decision about whether they can have another drink. Ergo, they could never get drunk, ergo they are mentally able to decide that they can play gambling games, or have another drink.

Don't put words in my mouth, that's not my argument at all.
The barkeep is already liable if they are serving somebody beer who is clearly too drunk.

Simply put, it shoudl be illegal to accept a bet/stake from somebody who is too drunk to place it.

at time I checked BT was the Incumbant Monopoly in the UK and OFCOM were ensuring that BT were not charging prices that gave them an excessive competitive advantage over BT Retail.

&gt;Noting the battles in the TV arena, he added: “It is particularly unfair that BT has to give Sky a commercial leg up when they consistently refuse to provide us with fair access to their own services

in what way? SKY invested its own money into Sky Atlantic and its commercial agreements with HBO etc, this gives sky a USP, just like BTs USP is ... erm I am sure they have one....


Lets see what [El Reg](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/02/28/bt_asks_ofcom_to_end_bskyb_and_talktalk_subsidies_for_wholesale_broadband/) has to say

&gt;BT is pressuring communications regulator Ofcom to end what it described as a ""pricing distortion"" in the wholesale broadband market that has protected rivals BSkyB and TalkTalk for nearly 10 years.
The former national telco would like the watchdog to end maximum limits set on the prices rivals BSkyB and TalkTalk have to pay for wholesale telecoms services.

ahh that makes more sense, BT is unhappy with the Limits Ofcom set on them (as per the Squeeze test) which ensures BT makes a return on its investment, without charging excessive prices, which ultimately the Consumer pays.

&gt;BT, in a rare – and what cynics might call opportunistic – defence of small Blighty ISPs, claimed that Ofcom's policy on unbundled lines (LLU) had meant that the little guys had ""suffered a competitive disadvantage"" due to a lack of capital to invest in local loop unbundling.

Really? as TalKTalk open their network up to 'the little guys' for them to run LLU, ISP install their own kit in the exchange and Openreach ensure that the copper line connects the ISPs kit to the users telephone socket, how is this ""competitive disadvantage' simply put, you invest in LLU and you make a return, based on your competitive pricing structure, OFCOM ensure Openreach do not charge excessively for this (personally I think they still do as an Openreach BB engineer can cost upto £300 a visit to try and sort out your broadband, which co-coincidently is not covered under Openreach Supplier Information Notes -349 *Telecom people will get this reference*)
 
&gt;Ofcom’s policy has achieved its goals with the number of fully unbundled lines now standing at 7.6 million compared with less than 50,000 in 2005. The main beneficiaries have been Sky and TalkTalk who now have more than nine million broadband customers between them, around half of all the broadband connections carried over BT’s network.

Ever considered the reason for this is that the other ISP have invested in their products and offer pricing structures that customers and businesses find attractive? as opposed to BT's pricing (just look at their 'charges' for previously free Class 5 services)

Talktalks response?
&gt;The people who have benefitted from Ofcom's regulation [are] consumers. What BT are actually calling for is for consumers and businesses to pay more for broadband, and for that money to go straight into BT's pockets. Ofcom should be proud of how their approach to regulation has lead to the UK having one of the most competitive markets in the world and they must keep it that way. We urge Ofcom to ignore this self-serving request.

just highlights WHO is to gain the most from pricing increases....

Your categories will depend on you. Most people divide their spending into things like household, groceries, bills, entertainment, and so on, but the level of detail you want is up to you. It's useful, if you're budgeting, to distinguish fixed outgoings (rent, bills, etc) from discretionary spending such as nights out.

Most people think about their budgets on a monthly basis, so one of the most helpful things about recording your outgoings is that it factors in all those annual expenses which you tend to forget (insurance, car tax, Christmas, holiday, etc). When you have gathered about a year's data then you can review it and start to get a good idea of your spending habits.

Another benefit is that when you start to track all your spending, it makes you think twice about some silly or excessive purchases.

You can only stop smoking if you WANT to stop smoking deep down. If you superficially claim to stop smoking but deep down still enjoy it or don't want to quit, you will think of all the excuses in the world to smoke.

&gt;Types of samples
The best sampling is probability sampling, because it increases the likelihood of obtaining samples that are representative of the population.

Probability sampling (Representative samples)

Probability samples are selected in such a way as to be representative of the population. They provide the most valid or credible results because they reflect the characteristics of the population from which they are selected (e.g., residents of a particular community, students at an elementary school, etc.). There are two types of probability samples: random and stratified.

Random sample

The term random has a very precise meaning. Each individual in the population of interest has an equal likelihood of selection. This is a very strict meaning -- you can't just collect responses on the street and have a random sample.


The assumption of an equal chance of selection means that sources such as a telephone book or voter registration lists are not adequate for providing a random sample of a community. In both these cases there will be a number of residents whose names are not listed. Telephone surveys get around this problem by random-digit dialing -- but that assumes that everyone in the population has a telephone. The key to random selection is that there is no bias involved in the selection of the sample. Any variation between the sample characteristics and the population characteristics is only a matter of chance.

Stratified sample

A stratified sample is a mini-reproduction of the population. Before sampling, the population is divided into characteristics of importance for the research. For example, by gender, social class, education level, religion, etc. Then the population is randomly sampled within each category or stratum. If 38% of the population is college-educated, then 38% of the sample is randomly selected from the college-educated population.



Stratified samples are as good as or better than random samples, but they require a fairly detailed advance knowledge of the population characteristics, and therefore are more difficult to construct.
How to Construct a probability (representative) sample

Nonprobability samples (Non-representative samples)

As they are not truly representative, non-probability samples are less desirable than probability samples. However, a researcher may not be able to obtain a random or stratified sample, or it may be too expensive. A researcher may not care about generalizing to a larger population. The validity of non-probability samples can be increased by trying to approximate random selection, and by eliminating as many sources of bias as possible.

Quota sample

The defining characteristic of a quota sample is that the researcher deliberately sets the proportions of levels or strata within the sample. This is generally done to insure the inclusion of a particular segment of the population. The proportions may or may not differ dramatically from the actual proportion in the population. The researcher sets a quota, independent of population characteristics.	

Two of each species


Example: A researcher is interested in the attitudes of members of different religions towards the death penalty. In Iowa a random sample might miss Muslims (because there are not many in that state). To be sure of their inclusion, a researcher could set a quota of 3% Muslim for the sample. However, the sample will no longer be representative of the actual proportions in the population. This may limit generalizing to the state population. But the quota will guarantee that the views of Muslims are represented in the survey.

Purposive sample

A purposive sample is a non-representative subset of some larger population, and is constructed to serve a very specific need or purpose. A researcher may have a specific group in mind, such as high level business executives. It may not be possible to specify the population -- they would not all be known, and access will be difficult. The researcher will attempt to zero in on the target group, interviewing whomever is available.	
A subset of a purposive sample is a snowball sample -- so named because one picks up the sample along the way, analogous to a snowball accumulating snow. A snowball sample is achieved by asking a participant to suggest someone else who might be willing or appropriate for the study. Snowball samples are particularly useful in hard-to-track populations, such as truants, drug users, etc.

Convenience sample

A convenience sample is a matter of taking what you can get. It is an accidental sample. Although selection may be unguided, it probably is not random, using the correct definition of everyone in the population having an equal chance of being selected. Volunteers would constitute a convenience sample.	
Non-probability samples are limited with regard to generalization. Because they do not truly represent a population, we cannot make valid inferences about the larger group from which they are drawn. Validity can be increased by approximating random selection as much as possible, and making every attempt to avoid introducing bias into sample selection.

I'm not especially left-leaning, I just a Europhile. I appreciate that the reality is that people will dislike an argument because of the way it's phrased, but if people want to vote us out of the EU because they don't like the tone, hey, it's their children they're shitting all over. I'll apply for a Canadian/Australian visa, or see if I can scrape into a Scandinavian country.

&gt;The fact is that immigration into the UK is substantial. 

I never said it was insubstantial. I said that it was hardly innundated compared to other Western European countries, which I stand by (87% White, compared with Germany's 88% ""European"" and France's 85% White). A lot of Eurosceptics seem to believe, from endlessly seeing their comments, that France and Germany somehow have ""greater control of their borders"", which we can safely say is a euphamism for a greater % of their population being of native ethnicity. 

Moreover, they refuse to accept the fact that we are entirely to blame (if indeed you view Eastern European immigration as a bad thing) for the wave of EU8 migration because Britian was one of only three countries to fully open the border. Every other country imposed restrictions, so no shit we got a lot of Poles coming here, because they had either Ireland (hello tanking economy) or Sweden as their only other choices. Cue the waves of hysteria over Romano-Bulgarian migration when the fact of the matter is, despite what the BBC would have us believe, there aren't bus loads of Transylvanians marching over here to take our jobs, since they can go to all the other EU countries and actually get some decent jobs.

&gt;but at the same time people have a perfect right to debate this issue and resorting to name-calling just isn't good enough anymore.

Why, though? I do not and will not waste the time of day trying to convince people who are racists in all but name, who are xenophobic to the point of lunacy that their views are pathetic. The argument for immigration always has been and continues to be compelling economically, and frankly since I believe in a meritocracy I'd rather my services be done by people who are good at what they do regardless of their accent. So long as they speak English I really do not care.

&gt; You actually have to come up with an argument why you think immigration is a good thing and understand that not everyone who thinks a figure of 11.3% might be too high is a fascist/racist/insert your own slur.

Do you seriously think I don't know this? I am well aware that they have a right to debate the issue, I just don't think they have a leg to stand on. If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck but claims ""I'm not racist, I just think we have a right to take control of our own borders"" then hey, guess what, it's a fucking Little Englander duck.

There are certainly some argument against immigration, against the EU, against open borders etc that have merit.

I rarely, if ever, see them being wheeled out.

That's by no means certain; the company cannot turn things around if it has to make redundancies and the circumstances of any loss would greatly influence what action, if any will happen.

A write down or a disposal of a loss-making business unit could all contribute to a loss one year when the business is otherwise profitable. This is the case at RBS where retail banking is profitable but it's write downs and other business units that are causing the loss.

The main issue for me is that Ferguson bled that team dry for a last trophy so he could retire having put you back on top (which is absolutely fine but it's put his successor whoever it would have been in a tough situation). You now have large portions of the squad either deadweight (Anderson, Nani, Young etc) and then a lot of players again out of contract in the next few years. Having said all this though I personally would sack him after the Olympiakos game if you go out, simple reason being sometimes it's far too hard to change fan opinion once it's been formed, if you go out then even if you spend well in the summer I can see your fans still being negative towards Moyes.",0,1393678679,null,0,false,0,cfrolde,t3_1z8nt7,t1_cfrolde,t3_1z8nt7,null,1432611218,0,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,0

1. Category B2 games (such as roulette) have a maximum stake per spin of £100. You can put £1000 on a 20 second greyhound race without raising any eyebrows.

2. A recent survey by the ONS found that there has been no increase in the number of problem gamblers since the introduction of FOBTs.

3. Believe it or not, we don't want the money from problem gamblers. Myself and my staff are all trained to spot and interact responsibly, and we actively encourage people to seek help and even exclude themselves from the shop. Gaming machines now also have  mandatory and voluntary time and money limits, which force the user to pause and decide what they want to do next.

Look, it breaks my heart seeing people who clearly have a problem. I've seen it on horse racing, virtual racing, FOBTs, even the lottery. But the vast majority of customers I have are enjoying the experience, and betting purely for fun. And this argument that we're actively making poor people addicted is a little short sighted.

On 3 October 2011, Chelsea Football Club made a proposal to buy back the freehold land (owned by CPO) on which the football stadium at Stamford Bridge sits, which would pave the way for a move to a new ground. Chelsea Chairman Bruce Buck, said: ""Chelsea should always be grateful to those who invested in CPO. We know only too well how close the club came to losing our home prior to the formation of CPO, but that threat has now gone under Mr Abramovich's ownership and with the CPO structure in place we cannot plan with certainty for the future. I hope all shareholders vote in favour of the proposal.""


The proposal was brought in a general CPO meeting on 27 October 2011 but failed to pass as only 61.6% of the total votes were cast in favour of the proposal, below the 75% minimum requirement.[8]
In May 2012, Chelsea Football Club confirmed that they had lodged a bid to buy the site of Battersea Power Station, with the possibility of the club relocating to a 60,000-seater capacity stadium.[9] Chairman Bruce Buck did concede that there were ""a number of hurdles to jump,"" including ""winning the support of our fans, the CPO shareholders and local Wandsworth residents [near the Battersea site], as well as securing the approval of Wandsworth Council, the Greater London Authority and heritage authorities.""[10]

After watching that I would highly recommend Phil Scraton's book ""Hillsborough: The Truth"". It seems like the last edition was released in 2009, so it obviously doesn't cover recent developments, but it's incredibly thorough and exceptionally well written too. 

As others have said, you should definitely read the HIP report and the Taylor report. Bear in mind the Taylor Report was in two sections, an interim report that covered the causes of the disaster, and a final report that covered Taylor's recommendations (e.g. all-seater stadia).

TBH, there's been little written about the survivors. I'm sure that's partly down to survivor's guilt. Anecdotally, there have been a number of them have committed suicide and their families have put it down to Hillsborough, but AFAIK there aren't any figures. If you want first-person testimony, the Guardian has some good articles. There should also be something Tony Evans wrote (football editor of The Times) knocking about online.

You can't ascribe that to directly to FOBTs but neither can you discount it, especially given that [a large majority of problem gamblers (60%) consider FOBTs to be their most problematic source of gambling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3206226/), despite it making up a minority of their bets.

Those examples are all damaging someone else; so are completely irrelevant.

&gt; They can still play on a gambling machine, just not one that has such a ridulously high stake.

Who are you to say what is a ridiculously high stake?  It's their money, and their judgement about the relative values of their purchases.

&gt; Don't put words in my mouth, that's not my argument at all. The barkeep is already liable if they are serving somebody beer who is clearly too drunk.

You're not suggesting ""too drunk"" though.  You're suggesting that the machine be completely illegal at a certain price point.  That would then apply to both sober and drunk.

Also, what's to stop me, drunk, better four times on a £25 machine instead of once on a £100 machine?  Your proposal does nothing to stop the problem you claim to want to stop anyway.

BTW, the publican not serving a drunk more alcohol is because more alcohol would make them more drunk.  Gambling would not make them more drunk.

&gt; Simply put, it shoudl be illegal to accept a bet/stake from somebody who is too drunk to place it.

""too drunk"" according to whom?  You, by the sounds of it.  Also, that's not what you said, you wanted the machine limits changed, which is nothing to do with drunk or sober.

&gt; Libertarian huh?

So?  Is that meant to be a bad thing?  Desiring individual rights be protected?  That I'm in favour of personal responsibility over busy-body state edicts?

&gt; I have not sugested limiting the rights of an individual at all, just that the gambling industry needs to be curtailed.

Then you've suggested that the gambling industry's liberty should be curtailed.  It's also pretty disingenuous to say that you aren't limiting individual access to gambling machines because you're limiting gambling machine's access to individuals instead.

&gt; Yes, people should be free to make bad descisions, that doesn't mean it should be legal to put bad descisions all around them and tempt them to make those bad descisions.

""bad decisions"" according to you, with your set of ethics and morality.  The people who are putting money in these machines manifestly do not agree that it's a bad decision.

It's nothing to do with temptation -- this isn't bible camp -- it's whether you think people should be trusted to decide for themselves what is bad for them, whether they think what they gain (enjoyment) from that choice is worth the cost (financial or otherwise).",0,1393685930,null,0,false,0,cfrq1w5,t3_1z904j,t1_cfrq1w5,t1_cfrnk42,null,1432611906,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,MrPoletski,uk,Essex Boi,"&gt; Also, what's to stop me, drunk, better four times on a £25 machine instead of once on a £100 machine? Your proposal does nothing to stop the problem you claim to want to stop anyway.

The feact that you will Jackpot a £25 machine after at most, about £75 going through it. They were kind of self limiting.

You can drill money into these newer machines for bloody ever and not get a jackpot.


&gt; ""too drunk"" according to whom? You, by the sounds of it. Also, that's not what you said, you wanted the machine limits changed, which is nothing to do with drunk or sober.

no, obviously by some accepted standard, I'm not a *complete* tool.


&gt; So? Is that meant to be a bad thing? Desiring individual rights be protected? That I'm in favour of personal responsibility over busy-body state edicts?

No it's not, was just an observation. I have a lot of libertarian leanings myself, I'm just no anarchist like a lot of them *actually* are.


&gt; Then you've suggested that the gambling industry's liberty should be curtailed. It's also pretty disingenuous to say that you aren't limiting individual access to gambling machines because you're limiting gambling machine's access to individuals instead.

Not even limiting their access to gambling machines, just limiting the amount of money they are allowed to run through themselves.

&gt; ""bad decisions"" according to you, with your set of ethics and morality. The people who are putting money in these machines manifestly do not agree that it's a bad decision.

Really? ever spoken to one of these people shovelling money into fruit machines?


&gt; It's nothing to do with temptation -- this isn't bible camp -- it's whether you think people should be trusted to decide for themselves what is bad for them, whether they think what they gain (enjoyment) from that choice is worth the cost (financial or otherwise).

Go down your local drinking hole on a friday night and stand by the fruit machines. 75% of the poeple waste a tenner on there. The other 25% waste more.

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"The OP challenged me to produce examples of conflation between race and religion when identity formation takes place. I gave him one. 

The problem with most of the commentary on this subject is bereft of any knowledge of social science that deals with identity and culture.  Identity isn't something that forms in simple processes. It needs to understood according to context and history.  

Less Harry Potter more Durkhiem. I am in a rush so I will expand later.

Edit: So here's the expansion.

First, my perspective is of someone who has studied identity and society for a while. My academic colleagues are people deal with these areas, as well as Islamic history, nationalism, state formation, norms in society and the construction of social realities. 

All the comment made here ignore that the idea of ""religion"" and ""race"" are constructs that are based around perception and context. What none of these comments do, is deal with the context or the perception. 

The idea of ""race"" itself is a construct. It became what it is during the 18th and 19th century.  That concept of race informs what we think to this day. You use the world ""Caucasian"" to describe ""white"" people. Why? What was the original reasoning and why to we use it?  You can explore google yourself to explore these things. 

Secondly, colonialism is important because it created and embedded systems of behaviour in societies that remain till after it receded. I use the Syrian example because it's a really clear one of how an identity was created using religion to meet colonial demands. That now functions as a strong racial identity in the post-19th century in that it attaches essentialist ideas - or things you do because of your genetic nature - to religious identities. In Britain we had the same thing happen in India - and considering most of the people who are muslim in Britain come from the places we did that to - it continues to hover in the background of what we consider to be a ""Muslim"" or a ""sikh"" or a ""hindu.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; You can drill money into these newer machines for bloody ever and not get a jackpot.

Then your objection is the payout percentage, which is a completely different thing.

&gt; no, obviously by some accepted standard, I'm not a complete tool.

Please point me at the ""accepted standard"" for being able to calculate percentages, odds, payout probabilities and a standardised ""enjoyment factor"" versus blood alcohol.

These things are completely a judgement call -- in which case, individual judgement is where we should leave it.

&gt; Not even limiting their access to gambling machines, just limiting the amount of money they are allowed to run through themselves.

Limiting the amount of _their own money_?  Then it's not their money any more, it's yours (or the state's) and they are being given a sweetie allowance.

&gt; Really? ever spoken to one of these people shovelling money into fruit machines?

Yes; most are not addicts, and do not sit crying in bars for someone to pull them away from the machine.

Secondly; ever heard of ""revealed preference""?  The idea is to judge by what people do, rather than what they say.  Excepting the very small minority of gambling addicts, people who put money in the machine obviously do not really think it's a bad idea, otherwise they wouldn't do it.

&gt; Go down your local drinking hole on a friday night and stand by the fruit machines. 75% of the poeple waste a tenner on there. The other 25% waste more. The odd person will shovel ove a hundred quid in there, but they won't know it because they are so fucking durnk they lost count of the money they put in.

So what?  It was their choice to get drunk, it was their choice to put all their money in.  Their punishment is that they wake up tomorrow with no money.  Either they learn or they don't.  I don't think it's appropriate to limit the freedoms of the (by your figures) 100% of ""non-odd"" people who are exercising their right to spend their money in whatever manner they see fit.

Your tale is also anecdotal, and isn't evidence.  I'm in my local watering hole a lot, and in the six years I've been going there I have never seen anyone put as much in the machines as you report.  Now; that's not evidence either, but it is at least a demonstration that the machine is not creating a problem a priori.

Another LB is a necessity, due to the lack of competition there (Cissokho will probably go back to Valencia, and Flanno does well there but he's just solid). 

Now that Gerrard's eased in to his new CDM role, him and Lucas should be enough to contend that position in front of the CBs, so maybe another CM so we have 4 CMs competing for two spots (and also to have impact players off the bench to affect the game).

And also a winger (Konoplyanka the obvious target) to also either have that off-the-bench effect or compete with Sterling (so he doesn't become complacent/suffer from burnout). 

Hopefully FSG will give Rodgers a £40m budget - £10-15m for Konoplyanka, £10m for another RCB, ~£10m for another LB and maybe £5-10m for another CM (lowest priority however). ",0,1393688593,null,0,false,0,cfrqsx6,t3_1z7fet,t1_cfrqsx6,t3_1z7fet,null,1432612260,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Line ups:

Both sides are only like to make 1 change, we may bring in Allen into the midfield, we might not. They may bring in Wanyama for Jack Cork in midfield which would mean swapping passing range for physicality.

I'd expect us to play Sturridge and Sterling out wide. Doubt there'll be any changes at the back but not sure which side our full backs will play on.

Shapes:

Since we're likely to play on the counter, I'll start with [Southampton in possession:](http://gyazo.com/6ace2139e444b59141579651c4a948c0.png)

As with the Arsenal/Everton games, Liverpool will likely adopt a half press. The objective here is to sneak the ball off of Southampton (notice how our tackles are like passes) and attack the space in behind Southampton during transition. Which as we've seen we're great at, hence we're going to win 7-2. 

If Victor Wanyama plays, a big part of our gameplan maybe to target him in defence as West Brom did to Kolo Toure a few games ago. This'll mean leaving him relatively unmarked by turning up the intensity of the press when he's about to receive the ball and dispossess him to spring us on the counter. 

Southampton's obvious talents are Shaw, Lallana and the physicality of Lambert (and the inevitable childhood red scores vs. Liverpool scenario) so these players will feature heavily in Southampton's attacking play. They'll probably look to exploit the space either side of Gerrard (which is inevitable when playing 4-3-3 vs. 4-2-3-1), if things go bad I wouldn't be surprised to see us swap Gerrard and Henderson as we did in the second half of Fulham away. 

Another two of the biggest ways S'ton can hurt us is via James Ward-Prowse. His set piece delivery is excellent (I think it was his corner for the goal vs. us at Anield) so we'll have to do our best to avoid giving away free kicks and corners. Ward Prowse also is a very good far post crosser, playing on the right hand side this means aiming towards Lambert and Rodriguez coming in off left wing, both aerial strikers by nature. This means a big test for Mignolet, Skrtel and whoever plays right back - Rodgers decision at right-back might give a good indication of whose aerial ability he rates best between Flano and Johnson. 


[Liverpool in possession](http://gyazo.com/6a7684621f3f6160d858be6f2cb9a0bf.png):

Southampton press high and press well. But this also gives Liverpool opportunity to lure their defensive line up the pitch as we've seen us do in the Spurs, Everton and Arsenal thrashings.

 Arguably Southampton press better than anyone else in the Premier League so this means a couple of things for our gameplan. Likely Gerrard's switching of the ball will have to be on point - Gerrard will want to sit deep enough so that Adam Lallana can't sit on him but stay high enough to connect our defence to Henderson and Coutinho/Allen. This'll also be a test for Skrtel and Agger in possession, moreso a concentration thing for Agger and to be fair to Skrtel his possession game has looked much better in the second half of the season than the first, but obviously S'ton got at us last time at the back. 

Southampton defensively will want to push our midfield back and cut off the supply line between Gerrard and Henderson &amp; Coutinho/Allen. This means the midfield 2 will have to find space well but also be very aggressive in their press to force Schneiderlin and Cork/Wanyama back.

The good news is that the best way to counter a high press is to play direct penetrative passes on the counter attack. Obviously this is all about Gerrard and Coutinho (who I expect will start despite Joe Allen play well recently). 

As we're looking for space in behind our best bet is probably behind their fullbacks, so I expect Sterling and Sturridge to play wide. We may in particular look to take advantage of Luke Shaw's over confidence off the back of his England callup, or he may have a blinder but we'll not want to let him settle into the game. I expect Sterling and Sturridge to drop deep at times then beat the Chambers/Shaw when we attack in transition. 

With Suarez likely to play central I think he'll take on more of a creative role again, dropping deep to overload midfield in defence but also drawing their centre backs up the pitch. As we know he can play a through ball as good as anyone.

If they were to switch their stance to pro nuclear and when any of the other parties start scare mongering just ask them how they intend to keep the lights on and keep energy prices down.

true,MrPoletski,uk,Essex Boi,"&gt;Then your objection is the payout percentage, which is a completely different thing.

No, my objection is the the *rate* at which money can be spent in them.

&gt;Please point me at the ""accepted standard"" for being able to calculate percentages, odds, payout probabilities and a standardised ""enjoyment factor"" versus blood alcohol. These things are completely a judgement call -- in which case, individual judgement is where we should leave it.

I said an accepted standard, if there isn't one then there should be. What I am talking about is an accepted level of drunkeness of a customer where you are no longer allowed to let them gamble etc. I see from other comments here that this is already covered under law in casinos and betting shops, but not for pubs and fruit machines.


&gt;Limiting the amount of their own money? Then it's not their money any more, it's yours (or the state's) and they are being given a sweetie allowance.

No, limiting the amount of money that can physically go through the machine per hour. Not limiting the amount a person can spend on those machines.


&gt;Secondly; ever heard of ""revealed preference""? The idea is to judge by what people do, rather than what they say. Excepting the very small minority of gambling addicts, people who put money in the machine obviously do not really think it's a bad idea, otherwise they wouldn't do it.

Since when did people thinking it was a bad idea to do something stop them from doing it. Ever seen a person smoke? break the speed limit? take hard drugs?


&gt;So what? It was their choice to get drunk, it was their choice to put all their money in. Their punishment is that they wake up tomorrow with no money. Either they learn or they don't. I don't think it's appropriate to limit the freedoms of the (by your figures) 100% of ""non-odd"" people who are exercising their right to spend their money in whatever manner they see fit.

For the last time, I am not saying you should be told how you can or can't spend your money. I am saying that fruit machines need to be toned down. No person is having their right to spend money affected at all by this proposal, it is the gambling machine that is being affected.

To say that limiting the rate at which a gambling machine can accept money is infringing a gamblers rights is like saying you are infringing the rights of drivers by forcing car manufacturers to include seat belts in their cars (and hence the driver to pick up the cost).

Because as I've outlined elsewhere in this thread, 60% of problem gamblers identify FOBTs as their greatest problem gambling.  These machines are unique and more damaging than more conventional gambling methods. 

&gt;If they are addicts, they will get their gambling fix elsewhere.

&gt;All this does is stop people who can use them sensibly.

And as I've also said, they are preferentially used by those with gambling problems.  Regulating them impacts problem gamblers far more effectively than interventions in other areas.  How do you define any use of a FOBT as particularly sensible?  By income?  In which case, why should we allow preferential placement of FOBTs in low-income areas?

Today he wasn't even playing in that position for the majority of the game and wasn't playing that good at the other positions until he got the role. He's one of the most composed and best finishers on our team who can go at teams for an entire 90 minutes at full pace with his stamina and also drops back into midfield to swap positions.

As soon as he started scoring and took the role over from Torres he was getting in and threatening at every attack. Now if you just replaced the Torres who fell back behind him with a midfielder like Willian then we will obviously play even better especially against teams who park the bus or mark our players out of the game. We can catch them out like this.


This isn't the strategy against every team but against the ones who are causing us trouble this is a great tactic to utilize. I just hope Jose continues playing him and also gives him this role from time to time. Like I said before, once he hits full stride it will be difficult to get him out of our starting 11.

From the site of my localish college...so commuting-wise, it's doable! Suddenly 70 doesn't seem as bad :D It's not a pretty option though. Are you on a main rail line? The season tickets are really rather expensive, but if you can get some bursary from the college then it will help (and is somewhat a drop in the ocean compared to 9k/year + living). It's a pretty mega mental toll though, that level of commuting. 

Other wild thing...ask your parents if you have any relatives you could theoretically go stay with during the week - maybe even just periodically. Involves them having space and so on, but a shorter/less expensive commute might outweigh it and would give you more of your time back. Sort of depends on how your timetable is going to fall I think - ask the college if they can provide any information on that.

Student debt isn't *too* bad in some ways. As in, it's debt and avoiding it where possible is super but repayment-wise and so on it's very easy to deal with.

I'm not sure if what you're interested in is what I'm thinking of (3d modelling, textures etc) but the principle is the same regardless of whether it's computer related, minus the BTEC.

The reason for this is that specialising so much so early on isn't such a good idea since it limits your opportunities, and if you did want to go to university at some point you'd be learning the same things on your first year, though without the fundamentals more 'traditional' courses teach.

As for student debt, it's something you don't need to worry about. This isn't America where you end up paying it back whether or not you can afford it and end up homeless or something. Uni is a good thing.

If Torres is centrally located, Hazard does not have as much space to move into when he cuts in from wide positions.  To open up more space for Hazard, Torres will cycle out to the left wing, which leaves a giant hole in the center for Hazard to occupy.

This can happen on the other wing as well and probably will more frequently if Mo Salah, another inside-out winger (left-footed right winger) is on the field.  It is not just Torres that moves out wide either.  Ba and Eto'o do this as well.

Furthermore, Torres' movement from the center into a channel can drag an opposing center-back out position.  As Torres moves out wide, a defender has to follow him because the fullback is already occupied with the winger (usually Hazard).  When Hazard cuts in and Torres moves to a channel, the opposing fullback is forced to make a tackle on Hazard with his weak foot or run the risk of allowing Hazard in on goal, as the center-back that should be there stop Hazard followed Torres out wide instead.",0,1393694130,null,0,false,0,cfrsoxz,t3_1z9p6q,t1_cfrsoxz,t3_1z9p6q,null,1432613149,31,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,31

People who are in charge of running the economy also think it's a bad thing too. A correction in the housing market won't just hurt the caricature of the evil cackling landlord who lights a cigar with a £20 note. It will send millions into huge negative equity, which has a direct correlation with reduced economic activity, which brings down growth and will send us into another recession. And as we know, such a recession will hurt the poor most of all, which are the ones we would have been trying to help.

true,Crispyshores,cnty-england,South London,"Quick breakdown on benefit spending in the UK in size order:
Of the £159 billion spent on Benefits in 2011-12:

£74.2 billion was on state pensions (47%)

£16.94 billion was on housing benefit (11%)

£12.57 billion was on disability living allowance (8%)

£8.11 billion was on pension credit (5%)

£6.92 billion was on income support (4%)

£5.45 billion was on rent rebates (3%)

£5.34 billion was on attendance allowance (3%)

£4.94 billion was on incapacity benefit (3%)

£4.91 billion was spent on JSA (3%)

£4.83 billion was on council tax benefit (3%)

And the remaining 10% or so is made up of things like carer allowance, sick pay, maternity pay etc.

There's a huge disconnect between what people think we spend benefits money on, and how much the 'lazy and feckless' types are really costing us.  If you asked the man/woman on the street how much they thought we spent on JSA and how much that was out of the total benefits budget, I'd almost guarantee they'd wildly overestimate it.  £12.57 billion on disability is peanuts for a first world country of our size, let alone when we're spending £150 million+ each on fighter jets.

They pushed both wings up to try and attack us more direct, which was an awful decision to even think about against us. 1st half they were defending well containing both Hazard and Schurrle with Parker and Sidwell holding the midfield, but once Richardson was pushed to the half way line, Schurrle could quite easily run past Burn.

If there was one player to stay back against us, it was Richardson, and he didn't. That said, I do love Schurrle proving the doubters wrong time and time again, he's underrated way too much, and today's performance should show those who doubt him what he is capable of in the right type of setting.

Fulham had some serious chances in the 1st half, but they just didn't have the quality to finish today. The freekick they had with the fancy setup could of easily been a goal if they didn't shoot and passed it straight into an unmarked player, and overall Bent and Dempsey played terrible.

I feel like Hangeland coming off helped us also, as I am sure coming into the 2nd half Richardson would of probably been pushed further up with Burn coming on and Heitinga playing as a LB, it was pretty unlucky for them.

- Flanagan &amp; Johnson have nobody in front of them to help out defensively. Southampton's wingers play narrowly and their fullbacks push on, so Flanagan &amp; Johnson have been caught in a lot of 2-v-1 situations

- Coutinho's been poor, and this has contributed to us not retaining possession well. Retention of possession would have been one of the big reasons to play this formation - the other being that it lets Suarez &amp; Sturridge play centrally together.

- Another reason we're struggling with possession - and also a consequence of Coutinho not playing well - is that there's generally a lack of passing options for the fullbacks, who are being pressed by Southampton's front 4.

I'd change back to a 4-3-3 at half-time; we'll struggle just as much to keep possession in that formation as this, but we'll have better protection on the flanks, and given that we've got the lead, having both Suarez &amp; Sturridge together centrally is less important.

1. While both parties are anti immigration, UKIP are open to smaller scale net immigration in the future, while the BNP are totally against it apart from 'exceptional circumstances'.

2.  UKIP has less in the way of *explicit* racism.  They've never talked about anything like limiting ""non-white"" immigration like the BNP have for example.  Whether they're hiding it or not, there's no denying UKIP have been objectively less overtly racist than the BNP.

3.  The BNP are pro capital and corporal punishment, UKIP are not.

4.  The BNP are pro nationalisation of several key industries, which UKIP is absolutely against.  Despite displaying some right wing hallmarks, the BNP have a surprising amount of left wing policies , unlike UKIP.

5.  The BNP are anti-NATO, while UKIP want to stay in.  This is one of a few areas in which UKIP are much more pro US than the BNP.

6. The BNP are pro-national service, unlike UKIP.

These are just a few off the top of my head.

No single player seems to be playing noticeably poorly.

We're being overrun in the midfield and Southampton are taking advantage of our constant pressing by getting our few midfield players over to one side before switching and having a 2v1 on Johnson/Flannagan.

We created good chances when we had the ball. Unfortunately we could only capitalise on one, whereas we're also fortunate to not be losing as Southampton have had two clear cut chances where only Mignolet and the post could stop them.

We need to make a few changes to perhaps a 4-1DM-2-2(Wingers)-1 (4-3-3) to beef up our midfield and stop Southampton's attacks.

(For instance: my family are smokers and I also smoke, my uncle dies of throat cancer, I develop a strong hatred of cigarettes and instantly work to kick the habit - motivated by my dislike for what happened to my uncle). 

This is not something covered by upbringing, status, geography etc. - it's a personal experience and depending on who you are as a person (not a situation) you will or will not display the willpower and desire to make a change. 

The alternative is the argument that there is genuinely no free will and that all the decisions we make are the result of our genetics and environment - if that were the case we ought to be able to study a persons life in detail and predict their likelihood of - say - committing a murder.

I made it out of cardboard, paint, styrofoam, and duct tape. The measurements on the lengths and angles are slightly off but they work. I was crunched for time on the end so I didn't bother making the console unit on top, the chair backing, or the base around the skirt. It took me a good 30 hours to build the chair (most of it was decoupaging and painting the 48 dalek bumps (styrofoam balls cut in half, covered in modpodge and newspaper before I could paint them)). A small chair with wheels on the bottom would fit in but if you plan on using a wheelchair you will need to make some adjustments. I used my left hand to move the chair with me by laying it flat on the underside of the console, walked in a couched position (a hell of a thigh workout), and was on my knees when stationary.

I watched a documentary on Rolls Royce (engines) and it seemed like they take on apprentices all the time. A career for life, from the looks of it. 

A nice prospect. 

At the same time though, it's a huge financial burden to put on a company. The employee leaves after a few years and you might not have even broken even. Enough of that and it can become a real problem. 

Obviously the trick is to be a good company and be good to your employees, but some industries don't suit that style.. As bad as that sounds. ",0,1393700002,null,0,false,0,cfruxlh,t3_1z9ijq,t1_cfruxlh,t1_cfrr05d,null,1432614272,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I've heard this argument before, but never seen a coherent explanation that supports it.  

To my knowledge housing market corrections typically only occur when you have events like a recession.  So, you have a correction and a subsequent drop in economic activity.  That's simply correlation, not evidence of one causing the other.

Now, I'll grant you that dumping millions of people into negative equity through no fault of their own is a horrific problem too.  The problem with either option is that the worst of the effects land on the people at the bottom of the pile.  Overpriced housing hurts people who are locked out of the housing market.  A correction would mostly hurt relatively poor home-owners buried under negative equity.

&gt; It sucks, because while houses are clearly overpriced, the benefits of bringing them down is far outweighed by the huge nationwide economic drawbacks.

Part of the problem here is that it's nearly impossible to separate out the bias of self-interest and anything that's empirically true.  **I**'m not sold on the idea it's more bad than good, but of course I don't own my home.",0,1393700223,null,0,false,0,cfrv0na,t3_1z9hes,t1_cfrv0na,t1_cfrtcsd,null,1432614313,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

This is going to sound a bit snobbish, and I don't mean it to be, but that's something you truly can't understand, I think, unless you've been.  The location of Stamford Bridge is just so much of what makes Chelsea, Chelsea for me.  It's absolutely iconic.  King's Road, being a stone's throw from some of the most expensive real estate on earth, the neighborhood pubs around Fulham Road.  I actually really like, when I go, to get off the tube at Gloucester Road instead of Fulham Broadway and walk past the museums, South Kensington, stop by a pub for a pint.  That's part of what makes going to Chelsea such an experience for me.

It's a stark contrast to walking past 3 warehouses and two council estates that a walk from tube station to a stadium at Battersea would be.  I'm sure it makes financial sense, but that wouldn't feel right.

Edit:  Forgot to add, aside from the personal appeal to me, the current location (fashionable, lucrative, ""in"") just fits so perfectly with our historical character as a club.  Battersea is none of these things.

Before that, most people hadn't even heard about the show (I'm talking about casual internet user like your everyday normal classmate, that girl you sit next to in the subway, your neighbours, parents, you catch my drift...).  
German TV stations dropped the show years ago over low ratings, most definitely because the time slot was poorly chosen in the first place. However, the only way to notice it was via pay TV (Sky/FOX), because that's the only station that aires it. There is/was practically no way for non internet-affine people to hear about the show before the anniversary, which was heavily advertised in the cinemas. Afterwards a lot of people asked me about it and recognised it as the show I use to watch.
I got into it a while back because I read about it on reddit/imgur, but none of my friends had ever heard of it. Some started to recognise it as 'the other show Moffat does', after getting into Sherlock, but that's about it, at least for me (I don't frequent geek stores, solely because we don't have any around here and well, I'm not a convention-y guy).
Also, a friend of mine works in distribution for one of the larger electronic markets and he confirmed a heavy sales increase after the special. Before that, he said, there were barely more than one or two inquiries a month.
To cut a long story short, I really hope the show starts to get more recognition around here, especially after the anniversary.

Totally agree. I'm amazed that people in this sub are swallowing the Thatcherite rhetoric on personal responsibility when it comes to gambling machines, but will then complain bitterly about the Government cutting top level taxes, bending over to corporate will, etc.

This view furthers the lie of the conservative right- that this is some sort of meritocracy where poor people deserve to be poor and working hard is rewarded. The truth is that working hard is very rarely, if ever rewarded. Success is almost entirely based on where, when and to whom you were born. The ""self made man"" is an endangered species.

true,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,"&gt; Really? as TalKTalk open their network up to 'the little guys' for them to run LLU, ISP install their own kit in the exchange and Openreach ensure that the copper line connects the ISPs kit to the users telephone socket, how is this ""competitive disadvantage' simply put,

Perhaps they're referring to how BT Wholesale services have historically been way more expensive than LLU (where BTw prices, if I remember correctly, are regulated by Ofcom so that BT can't undercut if they wanted to). Smaller ISPs who use BTw have to charge more than the likes of TalkTalk who are in a position to own their own network and name their price.

&gt;  which co-coincidently is not covered under Openreach Supplier Information Notes -349 Telecom people will get this reference)

No SIN I have ever read discusses pricing. That's in the BT price list, or whatever it's called today. I don't agree with the Openreach charges though, or the way they're applied. I once had slow speeds obviously due to contention, they pushed for someone to come out, he twiddled with the wires, I showed him the slow speeds, ISP told me that there was no fault found and that BT were going to charge them/me. Problem magically fixed itself a few weeks later.

&gt; Ever considered the reason for this is that the other ISP have invested in their products and offer pricing structures that customers and businesses find attractive?

I appreciate BT's investment. My exchange was not LLUed until last year, long after ADSL arrived (2005), ADSL2+ (2011?) and fibre (2011). So I'd be on 3G or satellite or something if I was left waiting for TalkTalk to bother to do something.

&gt; just highlights WHO is to gain the most from pricing increases....

I'm not sure I can believe that TalkTalk is being forthright here, both parties have something to gain from getting their own way and it's not fair to rubbish BT and suggest that TalkTalk's comments are gospel.",0,1393701588,null,0,1393701846,0,cfrvjca,t3_1z99jf,t1_cfrvjca,t1_cfrnml5,null,1432614556,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,wherearemyfeet,null,null,"&gt;I've heard this argument before, but never seen a coherent explanation that supports it.

Well since house prices is one of the main metrics used to measure growth, the two are inextricably linked. When house prices crash, the real estate market dies on its feet, just like it did in 2008. People who owe several thousands/tens of thousands more than they can sell their house for tend not to sell, and people who can see house prices going down don't want to buy a depreciating asset, meaning there are few buyers and few sellers, which makes prices drop even further (market forces). It becomes a vicious cycle. People in negative equity (or in the case of a big correction, millions of households) massively cut back to try and clear some equity up just to break even, despite the domino effect pushing prices further down still, seriously affecting economic activity which can push already fragile or risky economies to the brink of default.

Spain is a perfect example. Spain saw a colossal housing bubble that burst in 2008. Prices simply plummeted, pushing millions into negative equity. This was one of the bigger factors in Spain nearly defaulting and becoming one of the PIIGS countries needing bailout money from the EU. I grant you other factors were involved (trade deficits, for example) but the housing market collapse was a huge factor.

I can assure you that efforts to avoid popping the UK housing market bubble isn't the a conspiracy by MPs looking to keep their own pockets full.

And he tried to hide them by being funny and acting immature/like a child a lot of the time(his comedy reminds me somewhat of I Love Lucy, the slapstick aspect of it, and I have always loved that type of comedy since I was little). It was his way of trying to hide the sorrow and loneliness that he felt. He reminded me of this kid that I went to school with.

To the extent that my hours are nominally included in this study's figures, I would rather be counted out.

I 100% understand if someone else doesn't have the same sort of bargain going on - there's no point doing extra unpaid work for exploitative bastards.

If I could do anything, I'd have to weigh up if killing these would be worth throwing away my life for, which, in a society under law which does not condone revenge killings, it isn't worth that for me. 

Besides, I don't condone unlawful killing. I'd condone it if it was lawful to hang these men, and if it was I'd put the noose on their necks and pull the levers myself, and take enjoyment in that. 

So no, I'm not a coward at all, I'm just not an idiot who thinks he can serve justice, justice must be lawful. The problem for me is that lawful justice, in this case hasn't delivered, which is why I believe it should be changed.

For one of only a handful of times this season, the back four looked sturdy and worked well as a unit; there were moments of weakness, such as Lallana's shot that hit the post, but it more came from the vast amount of space that Southampton had in centre of the park than any individual errors. Once we tightened up that midfield space -- courtesy of some intense, dogged work from Allen -- we limited their passing play and they never threatened with any more clear-cut chances.

Sterling changed the game in an incredible way also, and it felt good to have such a talent on the bench since our subs often lack the talent needed to be game-changers. Suarez was his usual, selfless self, providing a goal and numerous chances to others (notably Sturridge!) and Gerrard was an anchor in the middle.

Henderson and Coutinho were more peripheral than usual, but it just shows that, even when we're not playing our best attacking football, we can score goals and beat teams that, last season, we'd have struggled against.

&gt;

&gt;The **Gaza empire** (1824–1895) was an African empire established by the powerful general [Soshangane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soshangane), and was located in southeastern [Africa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa) in the area of southern [Mozambique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambique) and southeastern [Zimbabwe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe) as well as parts of South Africa (sections of Mpumalanga and Limpopo provinces). The Gaza Empire, at its height in the 1860s, covered the whole of Mozambique between the [Zambezi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zambezi) and [Limpopo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limpopo_River) rivers.

What I mean is.. if men wear trousers only, don;t you think younger male children should do that also?

I think it's more to do with what your elders teach you as socally acceptable.

I don;t really care about differences of opinion regarding gays or lesbians as I'm nither of them. but If a child wants to grow up and find a wife, then wearing a skirt is not the best way to go about it.

If the issue is related to why older people wear skirts or not, I usually think it's down to the fact that womens legs are considerably more beautiful then male legs.

Asking a young male to wear a skirt would be somewhat mis-guiding the child, and to be honest, I would see it as child abuse!

firstly I can't believe you need to be told this but you only think that because your a heterosexual man, secondly thats not the reason at all. Men wear trousers because they're more practical and we use to be the ones doing physical labour, women don't because people use think it was indecent to be able see a women's inter leg a groin easily.

For every person who jumped in and bought an overpriced house rather than be 'consigned to renting' there is a more cautious person who is currently priced out of buying a house.

It requires higher wages to support workers who have to pay higher rents / mortgages as well as limiting the space for a company to physically expand.

Higher property prices only help speculators, land owner, banks, landlords and estate agents - all of whom contribute nothing to the real economy.  

Pull away the artificial support and lets see how much it really hurts the economy.

true,Turtle_Blues,null,null,"Eh, as someone who is dependent on sickness benefits, I think it's inaccurate to say ""effectively siphoning public funds"", though I do understand what you mean. When you receive benefits, you don't get anything else. They've taken away the crisis loans etc. that claimants used to be able to beg for, so if you make the choice to blow your money on gambling, drinking, food, travel or whatever else, it's gone. There is no top-up, so - purely from that perspective - gambling machines can only take a given amount that, if people want to spend on recreation, they're entitled to. 

My concern would be nanny-stating over this. In my situation, I am stuck on sickness benefits for the foreseeable future, because the DWP's regs disallow me from doing the one kind of work I'm capable of (freelance writing), and the JobCentre say they can't train me to do anything else. If I do something like sell a short story for £25, I have to jump through hoops to declare that £25; I also have my bank account regularly inspected by the DWP and have to submit to 6-monthly or annual assessments of my health - which, thanks to Atos Healthcare - are now not medical exams, but drawn-out verbal interviews in which you're supposed to describe what you have for breakfast and what TV programs you watch. 

Personally, I don't gamble. I don't drink, I don't go out... I barely leave the house unless it's for medical appointments, many of which I now can't afford to get to. The only leisure expenses I have are second-hand DVDs, books, and the occasional PC game. But, if I wanted to have a punt at the bookies, I would expect to be able to, and I would expect to be held accountable for how I spent my money. 

It may be true that gambling addiction disproportionately affects (or perhaps most visibly affects) the poorest, but I'd argue that addiction in all forms - drugs, drink, whatever else - affects people of all incomes. To me, it seems like the money laundering issue associated with the statistics being talked about here is probably more relevant to a potential need for legislation than the fact people may or may not spend their child benefit in them. 

I do agree with the point made above about disproportionately targeting low-income areas, but - I don't know - maybe I just perceive a lot of the comments in this thread as hitting a nerve to do with perceptions of people on benefits.

You see, the cracks in the universe created in series 5 finale had been around for quite a while, and those stars finally going out was due to the cracks, not the reality bomb. Rose's universe ran ahead of the Doctor's universe, after all.

The reason this can only be true is because if the reality bomb ever was truly fired, there would be no way to prevent it and everything would end. How could Rose come to the Doctor's universe? Or hell even later, Micky and Jacky? 

Further proof comes from the fact that if the reality bomb caused the stars to go out, this would create a paradox. You see, the reason why Rose went to the Doctor's universe was because of the stars going out. Now, when they stop the reality bomb from every occuring, how could Rose, back in Rose's universe, in the past, have the motivation to come to the Doctor's universe to save all of reality? There would be no stars going out...

Therefore, the only logical explanation is that the cracks caused the stars to go out, which coincided with the reality bomb events in the most fortunate of timings.

“We are not the favourites, Chelsea and Manchester City are the favourites. We just need to keep going.

“If we keep winning then the belief is going to grow. It’s important to stay calm and take each game as it comes.

“Yes we don’t have the experience, but we have a lot of good things going for us.

In the city there are plenty (and maybe more) polluting new cars than polluting old cars. I would hazard a guess that a 10 year old 1 litre polo is better than a 5 litre AMG.

Creating an index based on vehicle seats or cargo capacity/particulates emissions would give you a fair scale upon which to restrict vehicles. 

Also, as opposed to an outright ban, you could create a permit which allows people to operate these vehicles within the zone. This would generate the funds necessary for induction-loop powered buses and Taxis. It has been in the news recently that diesel particulates are a growing concern. Getting all buses and Taxis electric would make a monumental difference. This technology is already in use in China and seems to work well.

Yes, but each time you win you get back 2-1 odds so that balances out. Roulette is the ""fairest"" game in a casino, the pay-out odds almost match the statistical odds of any bet. The only thing that tips it in favour of the casino is the 0 spin. If you put £1 on number 7 and it comes up you get back £36. The odds of this happening are 1-in-37. 

If I were the taxman I'd laugh in the face of anyone claiming a ""legitimate"" income from roulette.

So armed with my in-depth knowledge of the behaviour of electrickery, I wrapped tinfoil around my index finger so that it formed a long extension, tapering to a point small enough to fit into the ""live"" socket on my power outlet.

I then stood in a bucket of water, and, watching RedMenTV for inspiration, inserted the tinfoil extension into the socket.

Paedophilia is a dangerous mental disorder and is classified as such by various organisations, including the WHO. Plenty of places will offer treatment for it (it's non-curative, granted) and those who take it up shouldn't face stigmatisation.

Those who don't seek help should be stigmatised and should be made to feel guilty for not treating their affliction. The idea that in 25 years time people might think ""paedophiles are all right"" because they've (sort of) done the same to homosexuals is ludicrous. I say 'sort of' deliberately, of course: until just last year, the COfE had a special law banning gay bishops but had no such law for celibate paedophilic bishops.

(there are a ton of these studies).

&gt;Not even one person said ""men are never abused. All men lie about abuse."" 


Interesting.

So if someone claims women face a lot of abuse and a bunch of guys laugh at that claim but never specifically use those two phrases that's ok? 

&gt;They are specifically talking about the unsubstantiated claim that women are perpetrators of DV as much as men are.


So what about the first quote I posted. Even if men were say half as likely to be victims, that'd still be a shitty thing to say. Oh boo hoo, why stand up for the abused men of the world? 

Do you honestly think SRS takes male abuse as seriously as female abuse?

We need to prepare ourselves for the fact that we may well lose to Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool, and draw with Southampton.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Utter bullshit. Many other teams play with ""inside"" wingers and their strikers are not on the wing as much as Torres is. 

For Real Madrid, whenever Ronaldo and Di Maria/Bale are playing, two wingers who are always going infield, Benzema still makes many runs forward and does not go into the wings.

Same with Bayern, when Ribery/Goetze and Robben/Shaqiri is playing Manduzick hardly ever goes onto the wing. He stays more centrally then even Benzema! 

This is just a poor excuse for a player who really doesnt offer our club much.

Eto'o and Ba might go onto the wing like Torres, but honestly, they are not on the wing nearly as much as Torres. Torres might as well set up a home there, he is more on the wing then in the center. Whenever Eto'o and Ba play they both seem to actually stay in the right position and get off shots, both when you look at the stats have nearly 2-3 more shots on average per game then Torres.

I actually went to my TV and fetched the recording of todays match to show you how poor Torres' positioning is.

In the pictures I will use Yellow to label what is wrong or what Torres is doing, the red will mostly be Schurrle or what is correct.

**1st goal:** 

[The useless run made by Torres](http://imgur.com/edSSd13)

As you can see Torres is making the completely **wrong run**. Instead of making a run straight down the middle giving Schurrle his lane and opening up another potential pass for the man with the ball he effectively puts himself out of the game. Schurrle would still be making the same run with or without Torres there and he is not dragging any defenders with him to make his run of any value.

[The aftermath of his run..](http://imgur.com/Wvzjmik)

As you can now see he is not anywhere near fast enoguh to be able to recover from his bad run and Schurrle is already speeding away. Had Torres made the correct run down the center instead of towards the wings (the area he loves to be, who knows why) he could have gave Schurrle a target in the middle to square the ball towards. Schurrle without anyone open through the middle did the correct thing in cutting across into the open space, the rest is history.

**2nd goal**
 
[Here is Hazard on the ball looking for someone to make the run into the open space..](http://imgur.com/WFhJMyJ)

Hazard is on the ball and there is space between the defenders for a ball through. Nobody is making the run...yet. Torres is just off to the side and Schurrle is *beyond* him, who do you think will make the correct run?

[Schurrle making the correct run!](http://imgur.com/3oE0vap)

As you can see Schurrle runs past the pedestrian Torres and into the space. Where was Torres? Staying stationary off to the side. Schurrle made the run from the wing into the space Torres should have been trying to get into. The fact that Schurrle came from the wing into the striker position instead of Torres says a lot. Great play Schurrle, terrible play Torres.

[Torres still walking, very pedestrian like. While Schurrle rushes on ward to goal after making the run Torres should have made. Its obvious which player was hungry to score..](http://imgur.com/LiKm3EO)

**3rd goal:**

[The run made by Schurrle and the pass made by Torres.](http://imgur.com/YSuJNqQ)

Finally Torres something positive to say about Torres! He properly wins the ball from the air (although it was a huge mistake by the 6'7 defender Bern) and controls and passes to the speedy Schurrle. Schurrle again makes the perfect run into the space behind. This is why I believe he has the potential to be a great center forward given the chance. He is aware of the space and has the legs to get there and the finishing ability to put it into the back of the net. This was great play all round for the final goal.

**Conclusion**

Torres offers nearly nothing to our team. For a team like Chelsea we can do *so* much better then Torres and the sooner we can, the better. He cant make runs for his life and then the midfield is blamed for ""not giving service to him"". He makes runs away from the center lane instead of towards it, he shows no hunger to get a goal and spends more time on the ground then any striker I have seen play for Chelsea for a long time. Its not even diving, he just slips, falls, tumbles more then anyone for whatever reason. He also gives away *wayyy* to many fouls. He cant channel is aggression properly and just ends up giving too many freekicks to the opposition in their half of the field. I am almost certain that if we had a striker of Aguero or Suarez's quality that they would have had atleast a couple goals this match. The runs were there but only Schurrle really wanted them.

Edit: Thanks to whoever got me gold!! Means a lot!

&gt;The whistleblower said civil servant Clifford Hindley was the man who rubber-stamped the PIE grants around 1980.

&gt;Hindley, who unusually for the time was openly gay, was well known in Whitehall as a pal of Jeremy Thorpe, the ex-Liberal leader who was acquitted in a sensational murder trial.

...

&gt;He told them he saw a PIE grant application covering three years, which he recalled totalled £35,000.

&gt;He believed it was a renewal – suggesting a similar grant had been given in 1977 under the previous Labour government.

...

&gt;Hindley left the Home Office in 1983 and wrote academic ­articles on gay relationships in Benjamin Britten’s operas.

&gt;City University music lecturer Ian Pace told Exaro investigative website: “Some of Hindley’s writings certainly show a strong interest in pederastic elements.”

So what we have is:

1.  A guy comes forward and claims without any substantiation that over thirty years ago he saw an application for funding.

2.  The application is claimed to be a renewal, so it's instantly assumed that the amount claimed must be double the amount in the entirely unsubstantiated claim.

3.  The Civil Servant who signed off on the funding was gay.  If you didn't know better you might think that being gay was irrelevant, but if that's the case why draw attention to it?  Must prove there's something wrong with him, eh?

4.  A music lecturer allegedly claims there's evidence of an interest in pederasty in the gay Civil Servant's writings about operas.  A music lecturer!  Well, I suppose there probably isn't a Chair of Pederasty Studies available for comment.

Complete bullshit, stop abdicating responsibility. Unless they are mentally deficient they are quite capable of making their own decisions.

Because of idiots like you that make excuses for women and perpetuate the system where women always get custody and men can't raise their families.
