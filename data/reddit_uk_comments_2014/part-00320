false,Sgt_General,,Do it for Redders 4: Never Stop Doing it!,"I can see why you would take this view, and as I've said on this subreddit before, I genuinely feel sorry for Milanic, but I don't think that he was the man to take us forward. In fairness, I would have still given him more time because sacking a manager after six games is ludicrous, but we would have been very unlikely to get anything out of the Cardiff away game and Charlton home game with him at the helm (we still are unlikely to get points from them, to be fair), which would leave us in real danger of dropping until the relegation zone and I genuinely couldn't see him turning the team around.

The madness of his sacking effectively cancelled out the madness of his appointment - and the same went for Hockaday as well. Both he and Milanic have been poor, poor appointments and I think this is why Cellino's hiring and firing rate is so high, because he brings in people incapable of managing to an adequate standard in the first place.

I agree that, at times, we've played some of our best football this season under Milanic: the first halves against Sheffield Wednesday, Rotherham, and Wolves have all been really strong performances - only the Huddersfield game has been definitively better - but the team couldn't do this consistently for 90 minutes, which can only be put down to a weakness on Milanic's part. He either couldn't react well enough to the way his opposition changed things around at half time or couldn't keep his players motivated for the whole 90 minutes, if not both. Either one is unforgivable for a manager.

I've basically written an essay based on your first point, so I'll try to speed up my thoughts on the rest. I'm afraid that I don't buy points 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

In his four games in charge this season, Redfearn didn't lose us a single game based on his managerial decisions, nor did they even cause us to have a downturn in performance. Our collapses against Rotherham and Wolves, meanwhile, have to go down as Milanic's fault. A team that played good football and dominated the game suddenly playing to hold on to their fragile 1-0 lead after half time has to be down to the manager. That's what Milanic is about, he takes a cautious approach towards football and that makes him ill suited to a club that has looked better in attack than defence for a long time. Even worse is that he clearly didn't learn from the Rotherham game, as he attempted the same defensive thing in principle there and allowed his team to let the game slip away. Until Milanic took over we hadn't lost a game in which we took the lead first and during his reign that happened twice.

It's true that Redfearn had the rub of the green compared to Milanic: in all the games except Huddersfield we could have easily lost them, but Redfearn is much more positive than Milanic. He hasn't seemed worried about playing too many young players, unlike Milanic, hasn't given undue criticism to players yet (see Milanic's comments about Byram after Norwich), and this season hasn't taken a negative approach during games. The players really seemed capable of expressing themselves under him. The players really like Redfearn (hell, they even liked Hockaday!) and seemed to communicate just fine with him, so I don't think that will be a problem. They also seemed to gel just fine when we went on that four-game run, so they should still be able to do fine under Redfearn. We have a rather talented squad by Championship standards, in my opinion.

As for being forced to be negative, I disagree now and I disagreed with Milanic at the time. I'm sorry, but his decisions against Wolves entered the realm of stupidity. All the pundits after the match were baffled to the point of hysteria. I know what he was going for, he was trying to stifle Wolves on the wings like he did against Norwich, but we didn't have Doukara and he took Morison from an area he was excelling in and moved him onto the wing, where he's never played. That demonstrates a complete lack of knowledge about his players. He was too worried about what other teams could do and tried to defend with the team that has conceded the most chances out of any team in the Championship this season. It was never a smart decision to make - doing it in the last 10 minutes would make more sense, but from the 45th is ridiculous.

Finally, just as an aside, I rather liked Brian McDermott, he's a good manager who was taken advantage of - most of the promises made to him were not fulfilled yet he still tried his best because he recognised how amazing this club is. Admittedly his time in charge will go down as a failure, but it could have been so different if the ownership situation hadn't been so volatile.

false,leftthinking,null,null,"it is likely that you will have some Income Tax deducted - there will also be some National Insurance taken too.

you will most likely be paid via PAYE (Pay As You Earn), a system which works out the amounts to pay on a weekly/monthly basis (depending on how you are often you are paid).

Income Tax has a yearly allowance of £10,000 - you *may* end up paying a bit more tax than you should because ... admin  - this will *eventually* be corrected (I just got a £30 rebate for the 2013-14 tax year YAY!)


National Insurance is calculated weekly.

if you earn more than £153 in a week you will pay 12% on anything over that level (up to £805/wk above which it is 2%)

BOTH are calculated on your gross pay. It's not a case of first deduct the NI and then sort the Tax, (or the other way round)

If you see a place you like, the reality is that you will most likely have to take it on the spot due to the mad competition in the market right now (due to an oversubscription of students attending UWE who have taken many of the available houses).

That is something which is used a lot to support unionism, I'm not outright disagreeing with the statement however I'm not going to let it influence my thinking until someone lays it out in actual facts and figures. 

Bear in mind economic factors include Northern Ireland's geographic, economic and demographic characteristics in the context of the rest of the UK and how these would change in a United Ireland.

Northern Ireland lives beyond it's means because of the UK. If Northern Ireland's economic difficulties support the argument for remaining in the UK, then what onus is there for unionism to improve conditions.

Also, humans are emotional creatures and people are free to vote however they please, not everyone is going to value money so highly. This is idealistic yes, but not wrong.

Until the facts and figures are laid out properly (like the in the Scottish referendum) people shouldn't assume one way or the other.

Once it was because police had lied during interview, second because police had lost vital evidence - both issues that would have come to light well before, had CPS looked into it. 

The issue is that CPS only seem to look at these cases on the day.

Could you imagine trying to argue against this or, as a public figure, trying to campaign against the law when it was proposed?  The pressure exerted on you and the subtext underlining the arguments levelled towards you would have been incredibly damaging to your professional reputation. 

Any time a politician says a new law has to be introduced, we must think extremely long and hard (a-hem), because once passed, it would be incredibly difficult to repeal.  

Edit:  Btw, if anyone is interested, Mr Jack Straw was the man who introduced the bill for its 2nd reading.  David Lepper MP (Lab/Coop) is one of the law's cheerleader in chief.  Good news, though, David Lepper lost his seat in... Brighton.

Edit 2:

Believe it or not Labour, with some approval from the Tories, are making noises about *extending* the scope of the offence:


&gt;The Minister for Policing, Criminal Justice and Victims (Damian Green): Offenders convicted of possession of extreme pornographic images, including violent pornographic images, face a custodial sentence of up to three years. Sentencing in individual cases is at the discretion of the courts. Although there are only a small number of convictions for that offence each year, I believe that it is effective in tackling the proliferation of these images.


&gt;Diana Johnson: Is not the problem that existing legislation on violent pornography has been too narrowly interpreted, with only 310 prosecutions in the past three years? Rape Crisis South London has said that there is evidence of the easy availability of serious sexual violence on rape porn sites. I know that the Government are about to ban realistic rape porn online, but not staged child rape scenes. Why not, as the Prime Minister promised, bring online and offline in line?

&gt;Damian Green: We agree with the hon. Lady’s underlying point that the current offence is too narrow. That is why we are legislating to extend the terms of the existing offence to criminalise the possession of images depicting rape and other non-consensual penetrative sexual activity. As she knows, we introduced provisions in the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill to criminalise the possession of such images, and those provisions received broad cross-party support at the Commons Committee stage. I hope that she and those on the Opposition Front Bench will continue to welcome that.

You see, to these people, if the prosecution numbers are not at a high enough level, their solution is to criminalise more people.  How can anyone support these people?",0,1414443853,null,0,1414460608,0,cllhphb,t3_2kgne7,t1_cllhphb,t3_2kgne7,null,1426320745,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

Ended up not being able to stop in time after locking my brakes (tyres don't grip well on granite). Ended up in the sea. 

  It took a while for me to get the bike back on the road due to not having any work space at the time, and it being winter (too dark to see what I was doing after work) however I did eventually get the bike working again. I had to replace the clocks and both coil packs. Additionally I did a full brake rebuild and replaced the stock lines with braided lines whilst I was at it.

It's an amendment to the coding GP surgeries use to get reimbursed for the work they do.  Diagnosing someone with dementia requires referral, assessment,  imaging etc.  Further, a lot of doctors shy away from making the diagnosis as it such a weighty one.  I think this will improve early detection of the disease.

It's not as simple as a doctor thinking ""I fancy a few quid, think I'll diagnose Ethel with dementia at 3 o clock...""

&gt;NHS England said it was ""not just payment for diagnosis"" and GP practices would have to form a detailed plan and show improving diagnosis rates.

&gt;It may include measures such as improving the way cases are recorded by a practice - so they are counted properly, or visiting care homes to assess very elderly people who have not previously been checked for dementia.

&gt;There is already a £42m scheme in England where GP practices were paid for offering appropriate assessments of people who came in with memory problems, or those with conditions which put them at increased risk of the disease.

&gt;Once patients have been diagnosed, there are further incentives worth £31m under the existing scheme, linked to delivering care for dementia patients.

- Supporting workers' rights by encouraging the formation of cooperatives, providing incentives for companies to raise wages above inflation, and raising the top rate of the tax, whilst closing loopholes.

- Encouraging the public ownership and operation of public transport, preventing fares from rising above inflation, integrating fares for rail, bus and tram services, expanding north-south rail services, and limiting inter-city flights where travel by rail is a possibility.

- Committing to reducing military spending by £5 billion year on year, withdrawing British forces in Germany, assisting charities set up to help return military personnel to civilian life, ensuring that personnel made redundant will be found alternative employment, and scrapping Trident.

- Utilising the National Drugs Board to aid in the decriminalisation and potential legalisation of currently prohibited substances.
Establishing a cross-party board to manage the devolution of powers to regional assemblies, devolved parliaments, and greater powers for councils.

- Ending the bedroom tax, introduce a living wage certificate, reverse NHS privatisation and prohibit PFIs whilst still reforming the system to adequately cope with the aging population, help people on benefits get back to work via a work program, and strengthen the cradle to grave ethos of the welfare state.

- Promoting a shift to renewables whilst commissioning new nuclear power stations, opposing hydraulic fracturing, handing the ownership of water boards to public bodies, regulating the energy industry, and setting up energy boards to manage, deliver, and regulate energy on a regional basis.",0,1414448909,null,0,false,0,cllkfdn,t3_2kibv3,t1_cllkfdn,t3_2kibv3,null,1426319476,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

He played simple passing football, and it was far from exciting to see us concede twice in two games exactly the same way. We played attractive football under Redders FAR more than we did with Darko. 

2. Managers absolutely do not have to be liked to succeed. One is not mutual to the other. You can be hated and still get your team to perform. Brian was liked and that didn't end amazingly well. 

3. I agree with this, however, he knows the youth and has a far better chance than Darko ever did. Plus, Redders record is FAR better than Darkos and he has less experience. Says it all really.  

4. Pressure does not equal negativity. Man Utd were constantly under pressure and still managed not to play so negative like we have. All the premiership teams are under FAR more pressure than Darko ever was and still manage to perform. 

5. I agree with this. Darko could talk to the lads, Redders is negatively effected here. 

6. Again agree. 

7. Meh. 6 games an no wins. There's no excuse. Didn't even come close to winning any games.

Appalling from every player on that pitch wearing claret and blue, no excuses. 


 Yeah we weren't exactly racking up the goals tally, but sure we hadn't got ol' concrete Ron and the big man up at the top. How naive. I've seen some bad performances in my time, some a lot worse than this, but there's  something more sinister at play here. Since we last scored over 500 minutes of game time has passed, and 13 goals have seen the back of our net. I literally can't see where the next goal is coming from...

 There's been a lot of talk about the run of games we've just come out of, but honestly we've got a just as hard run coming again over the next three games. Tottenham. West Ham. Southampton. Tottenham are a team we really struggle against, West Ham look terrifying, and frankly I only pray for mercy against Southampton.


 By time we play Burnley and into our easy* run of games, we could easily be looking at sitting in the relegation zone. I mark easy with an asterix because we've proven today that no game is easy. We lost 2-0 to QPR, who started the game bottom of the table. Last year we had a problem beating the ""easy"" teams, our only saving grace was that we pulled out some results against the big boys. This year we've proved we can beat the poorer teams like Hull, and throw some punches against the bigger boys like at Liverpool. But after losing badly to the other big teams (excluding Man U who we've yet to face) and unforgivably dropping points to QPR, Villa have got to decide quickly which team they want to be.

Firstly, barely over 150 people turned up by my friend's estimation, and only about a quarter of them were under 30. So the huge hype about new members and hundreds attending the conference was just hype. 

As expected, the younger members had a low level of political awareness, which meant they could be open to Marxist ideas. Unexpectedly, and quite shocking, older party members and the party leadership also had very little political savvy, as evidenced by their staunch support of the ludicrous 'Yes Alliance' idea and the complete lack of ideas in the 'how to build the party locally' and 'campaigning for socialism' workshops.

The conference itself was poorly organised. Branches proposed motions without any guidelines as to what it should be. So there were policies, position statements and tactical recommendations all cobbled together to be voted on by about half the attendees. I expect many youngsters energised by the referendum will be rather disillusioned by how dry the whole thing was.

Ultimately the conference was a very poor first impression. Its chaotic organisation might be excusable, as the SSP is used to being a small party. But the weakness of the party and the leadership is due to the weakness of the SSP's position generally. We haven't written them off entirely, some spread of Marxism might be achieved in the SSP, but its unlikely to be long-lasting.

I'm more convinced now of my belief that the SSP will shrink into obscurity in the coming years since hearing my friends' report of the conference.

The first Doctor in his earliest episodes was almost the villain of the show, taking his companions against there will, refusing to cooperate, in fact his first encounter with Daleks was because he lied about the Tardis being broken so he could investigate Skaro (home of the Daleks). 

His second persona was a lot less acerbic but he did what Capaldi's Doctor does in that he pretends not to be listening or acting forgetful or dismissive when in fact he's fully aware of whats going on. the Third could be incredibly arrogant, rubbing the Brigadier up the wrong way, entering any situation and acting like he owned the place, angering his companions from time to time. He even shot an alien that clearly wasn't attacking him specifically.

I don't want to go through every Doctor, but all had negative qualities and positive qualities, The 6th was down right flippant about killing a man.

If you want a modern Doctor with a more acerbic personality the 9th called Rose a stupid ape, accidentally made her family think she was dead by not bringing her home for a year, threatened to kill a Dalek that was defenseless and growing a conscience.  Difference was that even though Rose had known the Doctor less time Clara, she knew that he would save the planet if he could, that he was doing his best.  The reason the Doctor looks bad when seen through Clara's eyes is because she's ungrateful and thinks she could do better.  Even though Rose grated on me big time, I thought she was head strong and a real foil for the Doctor, Clara's just wanting everything her way. 

The point is the Doctors an alien, he isn't human, Clara knows this, and she's seen his 11th and 12th iteration save the planet more than a few times.  Thing is she doesn't want to bang this one, so he doesn't get her adoration, not because he's done anything wrong, but for not being what she wanted.

The idea that you would even engage these people was frightening to some because it was kids + the internet + sex talk despite the fact you were acting as a sort of unofficial net-police. They later made it in to a humourless version as a TV show 'To catch a predator'.

With Cardiff and Charlton next, I just couldn't see him getting a win anytime soon. The law of averages seemed to mean nothing against the malaise Milanic sank the club's form into.

I said it at the time of Hockaday's sacking and I'll say it now: I think that we've got too much talent at the club to be relegation candidates and hopefully we'll be able to show that soon. Antenucci and Doukara look a cut above your average Championship strikers, Silvestri is an outstanding goalkeeper (we pretty much owe every point to him), and Mowatt, Cook, and Bianchi should all grow into the team.

It's easy to view the game with rose-tinted glasses because of the last 20 minutes but in the first half we had pretty much one good chance, which we thankfully scored. Once we got the 2-0 we went on cruise control, but more because AV seemed to give up than anything else.

Fer, Sandro and Henry were class against Liverpool. Really bossed the midfield. At least in the first half. In the second, we subbed off Onuoha due to injury and changed to 4-4-2. That was when Liverpool started taking over. For some reason this team doesn't seem to be very good at 4-4-2. I think we saw that today as well. Fer, Sandro and Henry could hardly complete a 10 yard pass in the first half. And Fer does *not* belong on the left. Kept drifting inwards towards the centre of midfield and left acres of space behind him which AV exploited again and again. Another reason we were lucky today because a better team would've made us pay for that. However, once we brought Hoilett on and went 4-5-1, and let Fer play through the middle, suddenly we were bossing. In other words, we need to persist with the 3-5-2 experiment as soon as Onuoha comes back.

MOTM for me was Yun Suk Young. How long has he been in our squad without starting again? Today he was full of energy, had great workrate, great positioning, great intelligence. If he keeps this up he'll begin to rival Onuoha for my favourite QPR player.

I also want to point out that this game was like the inverse of how QPR games so far this season have tended to play out. Usually our midfield is pretty good but our defence leaks a goal or two; our strikers are inefficient, waste a few chances and we end up losing 1-0 or 2-1 or something. But today, in spite of misplaced passes in midfield, our attack was clinical and our defence was watertight.

Your tutor is probably your first point of contact here,  or student services if you prefer.  The best time to take time out is at the end of the semester so you won't have to redo anything,  but you need to do whatever is best for your health,  so leave earlier if that's best for you. 

Your uni can probably find you other students to live with when you return.  They can also probably help you to find someone to take over your house contract,  but speak to your landlord about this first. 

You made friends before and you can make them again,  you'll meet people on your course and through societies etc. You certainly can apply to another university to start in your second and third year,  again your university can advise you on this. Is your degree BPS accredited?  If it is then it should be pretty straightforward to switch. 

In terms of applying to jobs,  you could always say that you decided that the course wasn't right for you if you don't want to mention your anxiety. It is quite common to take a year out so you should be disadvantaged because of it. Taking a year out because of difficult circumstances is a very good reason to take a break, it may be worth mentioning that you felt it would impact on your grades so you felt it best to wait a year and do better. 

Most importantly,  do whatever is best for your health.  You may find that returning  to university isn't the best thing for you, or you might find that the break was exactly what you needed.  If your university offers free counselling then take advantage of it while you can,  you may even be able to use it while you defer a year.

Austin - goalscorer, definitely benefits from  having a partner in Zamora, who I still maintain we need to replace with a younger model good for 90 minutes as soon a viable one is identified.

Vargas - pace and effort. Looks to be the type of threat we've been starved of for ages.

Isla - finally looking settled and combines well with Vargas.

Sandro and Henry - happy with these two. Karl Henry continues to be an honest pro.

Fer - for me, better in the middle.

Dunne - outshining Ferdinand already. So reliable in the air.

Hoilett - still provides one of the most exciting outlets late in games, when a player finds those long diagonal cross-pitch passes that he runs onto.

To summarise the main points of the manifesto(Though no summary will do as well as reading the thing itself);

1. Various wage and workplace democracy reforms

2. An expansion of social services for things such as healthcare and social housing as well as various reforms communalising the management of such services

3. Green Energy initiatives, primarily the expansion of Nuclear Energy

4. Abolition of Monarchy and all related and similar institutions, such as the House of Lords

5. Devolution and Federalisation of powers

6. Formation of an upper house comprised of Syndicates/Trade Unions.

7. Reindustrialising the UK in a high-tech and efficient manner

8. Anti-Interventionism, Nuclear Disarmament and withdrawl from NATO in order to pursue these aims

9. Reforming the Education System using new methods that cater much more to the individual rather than meeting systemic quotas as well as a communalisation of the system

10. Increasing scientific research to 1.5% of GDP

11. The weakening of the powers of unaccountable secret services(MI5/6) and bureaucracies and reigning in the infringements upon the privacy of the people

12. Increasing cooperation with organisations like the UN and Interpol in order to foster better conditions for international security

13. Relaxing gun laws and advancing the Right to Bear Arms with trained people's militias intended to keep the government in check 

14. As a result of our anti-militarist stance, the UK's standing army would be dramatically reduced and replaced with a more Swiss-like system of well trained reservist populations.

It seems like the Season Finale will feature her, but I don't think I have enough information about her to really see her as any kind of... anything. Hopefully the episode will be some kinda penultimate encounter/cliffhanger with her character, and not feature the Doctor defeating her only to reveal there is some OTHER unseen being manipulating events. Her existence kind of reminds me of Madame Kovarian, but I feel like she wasn't built up as someone *so mysterious and important* the way Missy has been.

With that in mind:
Cech; Ake, Cahill, Zouma, Luis; Mikel, Baker; Salah, Oscar, Schurrle; Brown

Bench of Schwarzer, Terry, Christensen, Matic, Ramires, Willian, Drogba

The majority of those players have had somewhere between a lot and a bit of rest over the last few weeks, and I'd personally start Oscar since he came off quite early at the weekend and without him (or perhaps Willian) we're starting to look a bit unproven going forward.

That being said some of the stories this season have been a mixed bag for me,  
**Deep Breath** was a nice intro to a new doctor which could always be a little 'bumpy'. Also Scottish Vastra was fun  
**Into The Dalek** - was interesting to say the least, a new aspect of a classic villain.  
**Robot of Sherwood** - didn't interest me too much, the robots looked cool at least?   
**Listen** - was fantastic up until the last 5 minutes, in my eyes, a good lengthy build up to find out it was 'nothing' was slightly disappointed  
**Time Heist** - fell flat for me, not a fan of the bank heist genre so I had little to no interest in it, sorry,  
**The Caretaker** it was okay, would of liked a little more of the MoTW though  
**Kill The Moon** Now I enjoyed how this ended, bar the moon egg, I was glad Clara was furious with the doctor proving not every episode ends on a high note  
**Mummy** - Nice episode, loved the concept and setting, the one thing that put a dampener on things was its resolution of Clara wanting to leave the doctor from the previous episode, rather a shame, I was wondering if we were going to get a solo Doctor episode this season, but aside from that it was a good episode  
**Flatline** - This was just ... WOW ... Amazing episode!, really enjoyed it from the get go  
**Forest** - I couldn't enjoy this episode it was very cringe worthy, I'm not often a fan of children in Who but if they are done well, Amelia Pond, they really add to the story but these kids grated on me rather quickly especially the one who overreacted to everything, with the addition of a very loose/simplistic plot it felt more like Who FanFiction then the standard we're used to from Who writers, granted it was this guys first time writing for who but at some points the dialogue exchanges felt very out of character  
  
  
That being said not all of its bad, Listen keeps making me think about that bedding scene and asking questions, Flatline keeps making me think ""Wow this is pretty awesome"". Going to keep watching for more of Eyebrows specially in the finale trailer as I'm loving 12 he feels like 9, and often sounds like 4 but dresses like 3, His one liners are the best ""Old people die, its their occupation"", season 9 could prove quite interesting",0,1414461444,null,0,false,0,cllr4hz,t3_2khvmn,t1_cllr4hz,t3_2khvmn,null,1426316281,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Well that's a disappointing and crap reason.

She mentions that 'due to impartiality rules, I am not allowed to visually support [all the other charities she supports] whilst presenting news programmes,' but the very fact the poppy is excluded from those impartiality rules is indicative of the poppy's special (and impartial) status.

I wonder why she feels other reporters do not feel 'uncomfortable' doing this. Is she just super thoughtful?

This rebooted everyone's memories (hence why Amy could not remember what was missing on her wedding day). No large-scale event gaining worldwide attention has happened since that point in Earth's timeline. The closest thing is the Kill the Moon episode, which doesn't occur for another thirty five years after this episode (also mentioning the events of Kill the Moon as canon around diehard Whovians will likely get you shot). I have no idea why they're so confused prior to the Pandorica two-parter, but likely it's because having an entire civilian population be completely okay with a sudden influx of aliens isn't very realistic - mob mentality, and you'd be amazed what kind of stuff an ordinary person will swallow from the government if it's easier to forget and ignore what they see.

Out of universe, Tennant and Russell T Davies came off a crazy good Whoniverse renaissance age. New showrunner and a new Doctor meant Moffat and Matt had quite a bit to prove, and trying to follow that era to the letter would have only upset people. Keeping things exactly the same would never have worked out, so Ten's last episode wrapped up everything rather nicely, and paved the way for a completely *new* start to Doctor Who as a show.

EL opposition (for the most part) can be in some quite far off destinations.

EL opposition can often be smaller teams from obscure places and motivation can be a factor. Beat a little team from Georgia and you're probably not running high on confidence for the weekend. Get a good result against a big European side and you're brimming with confidence. Get a bad result against a big European side and you chalk it off as a good attempt (unless you're one of the top 5 or 6 teams in the world). Get a bad result against that little team from Georgia and you'll feel like you've had the wind kicked out of you.

You've got poor plotting, nonsensical premises, radically inconsistent and shallow character development -- basically, a whole smorgasboard of technically poor writing. The deus ex machina problem from Season 7 has been reduced (it would almost have to be, right?), but there are still plenty of episodes suffering from it. And Moffat's incessant recycling of his own ideas has grown even worse.

On the bright side, Jamie Mathieson produced a couple of well-written episodes. Which means that series 8 is doing a lot better than series 7 (which failed to produce a single episode that was better than mediocre).

More generally, what you have is a situation where the show has been so consistently bad for so long that even diehard ""I'm gonna love it no matter what"" fans are falling off the bandwagon. When that happens you tend to have a backlash: The longer someone clings to a show in a state of denial, the angrier they tend to be when they're finally forced to let go and admit the reality of what they've been watching.

It looked briefly like Mathieson was going to reverse that trend, but Moffat managed to crush any fledgling hope that the writing on the series was turning around by scheduling the utterly dreadful ""In the Forest of the Night"" immediately after Mathieson's episodes.

Expect things to get a lot worse if Moffat's finale is as bad as everything else he's written this season. Expect things to become apocalyptic if the finale yet again features a misguided assassination plot aimed at that Doctor which causes the creation of an alternate universe (which is collapsing in some way), but then the Doctor manages to escape and reboot the universe because of a loophole. Because while there seem to be a surprising number of people who were happy getting that exact same series finale *three times in a row*, I think the fourth time in a row will be the breaking point.

A huge majority of young people [want to stay in the EU](http://www.social-europe.eu/2013/01/new-poll-young-brits-want-to-stay-in-the-eu/) and they are very liberal. They don't want to be told what to believe, they don't want to be over taxed or have an overly generous welfare state. They are in favour of gay marriage which UKIP opposed, they are worried about global warming which UKIP denies even exists and they really care about civil liberties and individual rights which UKIP seem to dislike almost as much as the EU especially if it's decided on by a European Court. Young people have excellent reasons to oppose UKIP because when young people are polled they report their political views that directly oppose UKIPs philosophy but lack any confidence in the unproportional voting system so they vote less often and are less often heard. 

So no it's not just silly kids being immature self-centred morons as you would like to believe but is in fact the first signs of a major new generational political change (akin to Thatcherism) forged by a distrust of government (because of Blair and no doubt strengthened by GCHQ's activities), overspending (because of Brown and the credit crunch) and generally more tolerant after growing up after the civil rights movement and gay rights movement.

false,Chrisischan,flair8,,"This has been a hot topic of late, and the problem is not inverted wingers themselves, but rather a combination of problems such as:

- Chadli, Eriksen, and Lamela are far too similar in their abilities and lack anything in particular that forces defenses lose structure, such as pace or aggressive dribbling. This allows opposing defenses to rigidly compact and hold their shape.
- Dier hardly does anything wrong per se, but he's simply not a fullback for the level of the Prem. Flat out not quick enough, and does not provide much width. 
- We're improving with Mason's addition, but we still don't transition quickly enough with our forward passing, and even then it either isn't incisive enough or the receiving player is not aggressive/fearless enough to turn and cause problems.
- Last but not least, yes, I agree the narrow pitch is problematic in the modern league and I absolutely believe it's no coincidence that opposing teams use this to their advantage by easily compacting the box.

Of course Harry Potter is for young to early teens, but people of all ages enjoy it, even my nan enjoys it, and she enjoys Doctor Who too. The writers and producers I think keep that in mind when putting together episodes to ensure that it stays close to it's targets audience, which is a good thing Doctor Who isn't for us per-se but we can enjoy it, or if your a parent you can sit down and enjoy it with your kids as a family.  

Saying that the actual show is becoming as realistic as an episode of thundercats at showing scientific matters.  In the moon the bacteria on the egg, has evolved on the moon, and now it's heavier.  That is impossible the weight of an object remains constant in an isolated sytem, what's known as the conservation of energy. Also we know for a fact the moon isn't an egg, there's been studies on the moon, the Apollo missions weren't just some jerks goofing about and planting a flag, they did actual geological studies there.  
In the Mummy story, The doctor describes what sounds like a wormhole or FTL based on Alcubierre, but the way it's shown is hilarious, an actual train in space. You can have something that looks reminiscent of a train, and show the interior as like the Orient Express without just having it a train IN SPACEEEE. It's called design and imagination.

This latest episode in the forest is again showing a real lack of knowledge of how the planet works, Trees produce oxygen yeah, not that much, even in the past the concentration of oxygen has been shown to be fairly steady, and it didn't rise in the Tunguske event either.  We see the atmosphere blown off, the excess oxygen that is.  Which means we've now lost loads of atmosphere, the plant's took in the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, turned it into oxygen and then blasted it into space, where we can't get it back.  The atmosphere is only 20% oxygen, so nitrogen would of done fine.  

Remember that crappy Nic Cage movie 'The Knowing' the plot that this episode ripped off, well that has a solar flare hitting the atmosphere too.  And you know what, this happens all the time, the only thing effected are sattelites and electrical appliances etc that are turned on.  The worse that could happen to the human race is that people wouldn't be able to tweet their 'topless tour' pics.
This is because space doesn't conduct heat it's an insulator, but by the time the charged particles get to us they're not 'hot', they're charged and tenuos having travelled 149,600,000 km, and they hit the magnetic field around the earth and most are swept away from the planets atmosphere all together.

false,Iosif_ravenfire,null,null,"Sign up for the pension as soon as it becomes available. Having your own private pension will pay off a long way off in the future, but you will be glad you started it as soon as you could. You won't be able to access until your 55 at least, but you will be far better off at 55 if you start it now, rather then in 10 years time. Pay in the max you can, if you can afford it.

The first thing to do with what is left after tax, NI, Student Loan (if you have one) and pension contributions are taken out, figure how much you need per month for live. How much is your rent, council tax, bills, phone bill, car insurance, car payments, food, petrol and so on.

How much do you have left over? That is essentially your 'free' money. This is the money you have to spend on savings, and 'fun' (going out, music, films, beer etc). Two options now: Have a look at your other expenses and see how much you need to enjoy a social life (but don't go over the top). Put whatever is left into a savings account. Or save aggressively, have a tight budget for fun things, and save a lot each month.

If you have no savings at the minute, I would perhaps go for something like a Cash ISA. The interest will be rubbish, but the money is available for a 'float' in emergencies (car breaks down at the end of the month etc). Saving may seem a waste, but when you need £300 quickly, you'll be glad you did.

Also think on what you want to spend, if anything, your savings on. A yearly holiday? A house? A new car? What you are saving for can influence what type of saving account you need. A Cash ISA will be good for a holiday fund, because you can access straight away, but an account that restrict access to the savings may be better for savings towards a house.

Try and think of the future too. If your living with Mum and Dad now for example, when will you move out? Your finance management will change a lot when that happens.

This Baroness is not in any position of power. She is a member of a Lords Committee, not a member of the Government or any Government department.  Lords Select Committees serve a purpose but they are hardly organs of great power; this Baroness is not, as the title says, ""driving technology law"" and she was never at risk of influencing policy on tech through her membership of the committee.

However, thinking more on it there was also [Gigglebiz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigglebiz) and they had a character called Keith Fitt who gave bad sports advice. I can't imagine he'd promote drinking concrete though as it's a Cbeebies programme.

Edit - Apparently there was also a Sports based sketch show called [Fit](http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/shows/fit) which starred Peter Serafinowicz.

If you have an abnormally small waist for your chest size, or vice-versa, then they will either alter the trousers or grab another pair from elsewhere in the store.

All three of the suits I've bought there had the trouser's finished properly off the shelf, and all of them needed to be lengthened a bit - they include this and any other alterations needed to the suit in the price, and usually the turnaround is pretty quick.

Best tip is to find something that you are comfortable in. A navy suit is pretty universal and fits with most occasions.

One other option, if it's not too expensive, is to pop into a Charles Tywhitt. Whilst I'm very happy with the suits I've bought from Slaters, the Tyrwhitt one's really are terrific suits.

Basically, Select Committees, under the Chair's direction, carry out inquiries into topics they think need examining then produce a report at the end which they publish. Government can then choose to either ignore, partially accept or embrace their findings.



So her individual influence as a member of the Committee is negligible: she can ask questions of witnesses during Committee sessions but only if she is called upon to do so by the Chair. The recommendations in the report are largely out of her hands, as is the extent to which the Government take or doesn't take notice.

The point is though that this Baroness isn't anywhere influential enough for her ignorance to have any effect. Because of how select committees work, there really is very little room for an inquiry to be substantially influenced in direction or conclusion by anyone but the Chair. 


The only reason this is being talked about is because her comments were picked up by some or other journo and turned into a story during a quiet news day.


&gt;if the government is relying on the work of such people to inform policy


It isn't! Lords Committees are very far back in the queue of bodies and apparati which affect policy. It's often the case that even Parliamentary Under-Secretary of States (the most junior rank of minister) is unable to influence policy if the Secretary of State has other ideas, so Lords Committees are really not the seat of any notable power in terms of policy making. 



The bottom line is: any alarm about this is pretty much unfounded. She is an inconsequential member of an inconsequential group. She probably should take it upon herself to be a bit better informed given her position but it's hardly a crisis of modern democracy if she doesn't.



There are plenty of problems with this Government but it would be insincere to say that this is one of them.

I hate posts like this because without context no-one knows what the hell they are looking at.

To simplify this enormously - what does Good Lamela look like:

(vs QPR): 3 shots / 0 on target / 3 Key passes / 2 assists / 5 dribbles/ 48 passes / 89.6% pass acc / 77 Touches

(vs Asteras Tripolis): 4 shots / 2 OT / 2 goals / 2 key passes / 5 dribbles / 50 passes / 90% pass acc / 77 touches

There is a lot of consistency there.

Looking at the data in the first half he only managed around 20 touches. This should have rang alarm bells as either (a) he was tired and not getting into the game or (b) tactically they had neutralised him. You look at Spurs' 74% possession and 60% territorial dominance and the only reasonable conclusion was he was knackered and therefore should have been substituted. This is borne out his final stats everything is down. Way down from a good performance. But what of the accusation that he only plays well when we're winning?


(vs Man City): 1 shots / 0 on target / 2 crosses / 1 Key passes / 0 assists / 2 dribbles/ 21 passes / 71.4% pass acc / 33 Touches -- Off (60mins)


The important things here are (a) how well his numbers are holding up against an elite team (b) the fact that he was taken off at 60mins and (c) the fact that he was achieving this with team only having the ball 38% of the time. It also puts those Newcastle numbers in perspective too.

TL:DR Lamela was knackered for the Newcastle game and should have been rested. His numbers are pretty consistent. Even when we're playing the elite his numbers hold up well.

We were never keeping these two. Not in a million years. Berbatov kicked up the most almighty of fusses, and Bale was being tempted by pretty much one of the best offers a player could ever receive as /u/Blubbey says.

&gt;VDV

He was trying to save his marriage by moving back to Germany, and apparently was neither rated by AVB nor agreed with AVB's philosophy.

&gt;Carrick

&gt;Modric

This fits entirely with the club's business model. Buy promising players with great potential, develop at the top end of the league, then sell on for significant profit. Berbatov and Bale fit into this category too. Without this business model we'd have nowehere near the financial stability we now take for granted.

As for your three options:

Paying back student debt is generally considered to be a waste of time, especially if your borrowing is increasing at a rate lower than inflation (~2.0%).

Paying off mortgages early is rarely a *bad* thing. That said, there is an inflexibility in that you can't get to the money if you need it. In addition, whilst there are early repayment charges it is probably a waste of time. Most mortgages have a 10% maximum overpayment before ERCs kick in - it's worth reading the small print.

I'm comfortable with the £4k emergency fund, although I may increase it slightly over time. I have ways to deal with serious unexpected costs aside from that, and as a bonus my job is very secure with good growth opportunities so that doesn't worry me.
I'm currently paying 10% into my pension, with 6% employer matching. So about £5k annually, which seems to be a decent amount. But perhaps the extra money might be better spent investing into that? My only problem with it is that I'd be unable to access the invested money before retirement age.

I've read through the FAQ now, thanks. So investing into a NISA seems like a good choice as I won't exceed that 15k cap, it's just a matter of picking the right one.

I didn't call it trivial. It might well put third parties off from intervening in all but the most important or high-profile of judicial reviews. That's a far cry from ""dismantling judicial review"". 

You seem to think I'm defending the government, or these changes. I'm not, except as a by-product of attacking a crappy article.

&gt; I trust you're not saying they're all suffering under 'an absurd misunderstanding'.

Once again, as it appears you missed it the first time, and as I said in my original comment, the author didn't clarify by which change charities might incur additional costs. I assumed they were talking about the same change by which they claimed that friends and family might become liable for costs.

false,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","Thanks for the perspective – I guess it’s an education issue that has people thinking that Europe (or the Western World) is an instant gateway to a better life (ironically if  you’re promptly cared for, given shelter, fed and clothed to even a basic level then you might actually believe it worked – if you come from a background of abuse, war, disease without medical care etc.) 

I honestly don’t know how much S&amp;R operations cost year on year, but I can’t see them being ‘cheap’? I guess that depends on your yardstick for cheap vs. expensive though. I also agree that we shouldn’t turn our backs on the suffering BUT we have to moderate that with the fact that we (that is the UK) cannot afford to help everyone, everywhere. So why these people and why us? As you say we’re not in the Schengen area – we’re far removed from this – but choose to involve ourselves at a cost. 

What happens to these people after they’re saved by the way? Where do they end up and who foots the bill for their care? 

It’s absolutely cold – and I realise that – to say that it shouldn’t necessarily be our problem. But unless we as a country want to shut down spending on our own infrastructure and care (and in a time of austerity – that’s already downsized) just to care for the rest of the world, how do we plan to do it in the long term? Is it sustainable for us? 

The humanitarians who say that withdrawing the help is inhumane area right that it’s not a nice prospect, but they present no argument of how or why it’s sustainable either. Everyone wants money spent everywhere – but never considers where it’s going to come from.

While I agree that presenting solutions is a pragmatic and important exercise, there's absolutely a time and place for passionate criticism, particularly when a lot of these policies are being swept under the rug and not elucidated clearly to the public.

I think it's especially unfair to accuse the article of lacking substance when it sources facts and figures throughout. It isn't simply 'Tory-bashing', it's providing real life context for policies that will affect real life people (in it's own, albeit sensational way.) Sometimes a little sensation is the only way to appeal to the empathy of the masses though, I suppose. A fair criticism of PT nonetheless, and she's certainly open to it.

I'm all for critique but the comment OP presented fuck all critique, just a useless tag line with no reference to the article and no relevance to the debate.

It's been done, nobody cares.

That's the point the article is pointing out:

&gt; So far, public opinion seems alarmingly content with these cuts – but before we despair of human kindness, many can plead ignorance.

The Joseph Rowntree foundation publishes articles criticizing the government's policies routinely as they're contributing to poverty, that are hard to argue with because they're ultimately grounded in facts and analysis. Shelter does the same.

The government's approach? 

Do not engage with criticism. Reframe the argument. Talk about protecting the NHS and frontline services. Talk about tax cuts. Don't talk about poverty. Don't talk about homelessness. They know better than that.

If they were going to do this with any intelligence, they would have compared the team's previous season's record during the period in which the group stage takes place to look for a decline, not just assume all of their issues spawned from playing on Thursdays.

How is this even worth looking at when two teams from Spain, from the same city no less, both competed in Europa and one moved up four places while the other was relegated. What does that say about Europa League involvement? Not much.

Wigan even being on there is a joke. What relevance does getting relegated and then finishing 5th in the second division the following season have to do with Europa League? There isn't even another English team to compare to in terms of going down a division and dealing with a Europa League campaign.

And Lyon from 3rd to 5th and Lazio from 7th to 9th? Where they the only teams in their respective leagues to have a difference in their league position of more than one spot that year?

This is a ridiculous graphic to make, show and discuss, there are literally hundreds of other factors involved as to why these teams finished where they did compared to the season before and this ignores all of them except for one.

Some good news from that. My dad's medication isn't quite right so she's getting that changed which should help his energy levels. She has noted his mood and is getting his GP to add in some antidepressants as well.

/u/Parkertron good call on his tablets I didn't know the name but I remember is was a weird something-point-something dose like the one you said. The nurse has checked them and also okayed it.

I need to see him getting out of bed and using his body a little more now. That would be good.

I've looked online and their local council has good information about support services, I'm going to get in touch with them after I've written a long email to his GP which will detail my concerns and observations.

There will sadly be a huge falling-out about the car, but I am prepared for it if I have to I will leave the car at his house, take both sets of keys and walk away.

He sees the car as is freedom and the only way to go for walks to rehabilitate himself is to drive to the exact same 2 locations despite literally having a huge park right across the road from his house.

Fair enough, if you can find planes and boats and volunteers that'll all run on 'best wishes and good intentions' then let me know. 

Sorry buddy, but you don’t find me sat here saying ‘sod ‘em, let them die’ but rather ‘realistically, how do we fix this – it’s not sustainable to keep pissing money away on this’. 

&gt; You wouldn't have multi-nationals like Starbucks,Facebook and Amazon doing tax avoidance to the tune of billions. 

That's another issue, by all means go after them. I never spoken up in favour of tax avoidance, did I? 

&gt; If you care about money so much the NHS couldn't even exist and is pretty much the same arguement americans use for not introducing a national health service. 

The NHS that's supported by tax-payers, you mean? Or do you think that runs on good intentions as well? 

You raise a good point though - the NHS is struggling. We're not a country in credit. So if you want to start making cuts, would you rather lose parts of the NHS or stop a S&amp;R operation for non-British nationals thousands of miles from home? 

You can't complain that I'm money oriented then go on to point out the NHS and tax dodgers - which also run on (you guessed it) money. 

&gt; You sit here and say we can't offer a search and rescue party while the banks are literally fixing the price of everything via the LIBOR scandal, whilst multi national companies that don't pay any tax despite using the infrastructure built and maintained by the state allowing them to profit, while we eat prawns that are literally the product of slavery in Thailand (http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jun/10/supermarket-prawns-thailand-produced-slave-labour[2] ) and you're telling me we can't have a few manned boats to make sure people don't drown? 

I said nothing of the sort. If you want to go after dodgy banks then I fully support you - this thread is about another matter however, and pointing out that running rescue operations for desperate idiots crossing waters they're not equipped to cross is costly and also not necessarily *our* concern is nothing to do with dodgy banks. 

&gt; Christ mate. Even how disgusted I am at your comments I'd still jump in a boat, use my own petrol and provide you my own food if I heard a report that you and your family were clinging to a fucking life raft 20 miles from my home.

Nice of you, but they're not 20 miles from home - they're *at least* 1323 miles from home (taking the closest point of Africa to us, Algiers, as a point of reference).

Taking out a student loan does not affect your credit rating and won't show up on any report.

When you apply for a mortgage, loan or credit card in the future the only way that these companies can know if you have a student loan is if they ask you on your application.

If they do take your student loan repayments into consideration it will likely be used to better calculate your net earnings.

She donates to the RBL, (presumably) she attends a remembrance service, observes the silence etc. The only thing she's done is not wear a bit of plastic on TV.

1) By having more money then the other teams. 
2) Fulfilling criteria of Option 1.

It's not player power, it money power.  See Atletico Madrid, constantly have champions league football, did really fucking well last season, best players still leave because money. 


So that leaves Spurs with the options:


1) Get a sugar daddy, try and do a City.  It would be quite Spursy to do this once FFP rules have come and would making it a lot harder to do so.


2) Go for broke, take out a few risky loans, spend beyond means with the premise we'll get champions league football, leading to more revenue and it will all be fine. I personally think Leeds will stay up in the Championship this season, which will be a great result for them...


3) Have a fucking daemon for a chairman that buys young players for 9mil and flogs them to Real Madrid for 100, get 8mil for Jake Livermore and it determined to get us into a new stadium so we have a long-standing increase in revenue.

You will be doing too many repetitive movements creasing your mouth and eye area, using up antioxidants, vitamins, minerals and healthy fats at a faster rate than non smokers, reduced capillary circulation to the skin. You might get some results from a prescription strength retinoid alongside cosmetics like a high strength vitamin C serum, but that would mean seeing a private dermatologist in the UK.

Sorry if that sounds preachy, I just don't want to give you false hope. Whilst you are smoking you can't even really do much in the way of acid peels or microneedling because healing is delayed and infection risk is increased. However there is a ton of help via the NHS from free weekly group or one to one 'counselling', various prescription drugs from nicotine replacement to tablets to block cravings. November and December are a great time of year to access NHS stop smoking support or join a gym, the public is not interested in getting healthy until January!!

You might get some anti ageing benefits if you use fairly potent topicals AND your diet is optimal so feeding the skin from the outside and inside simultaneously (oily fish regularly, nine servings of low sugar fruit and non starchy veg each day, beans/ lentils/ seeds/ nuts for minerals, little to no sugar or processed carbs). You might keep an eye on /r/skindietandnutrition/ too.

In winter sunscreen is not essential in the UK (see sidebar)  unless you are using topical actives that increase UV sensitivity, or are exposed by sitting near a window/ in the car during daylight hours. You should use half a teaspoon of sunscreen for face and neck and reapply as required.

Unfortunately combining lesser amounts of two products doesn't give you more protection unless they both use the exact same sunscreen agents, nor does half the amount confer half the protection, more like a quarter.

You know what people are like, I'm sure you can see how that's going to turn out. Oh, they can take them back whenever they like as well it seems.

The small firms have existing contracted clients under the current system which operates well. It's the big companies that are getting poor reports from inspectors but the EU and our MP's think it's a better idea to have corporate monopolisation.

If you get chance I'd strongly recommend you find a spare box and play with something like VMWare ESXi, Hyper-V, Xen, KVM, etc. The biggest change to computing I've seen working here for 9 years was the mainstream adoption of virtualisation, I don't think it's going anywhere :).

As for abuse of the SCC magic-box, nothing that isn't solved by the Deanery ;). You cock about you get kicked off, you cock about seriously enough you get excluded from uni. Great power, great.... yadda, yadda. :). Virtual machines do have that issue of being forgotten though, they can't be seen, if it's idle they take up few resources, etc. VMs set up for classes are likely scheduled to be deleted before they are even created :).

The HPC is advertised as it's good for getting research grants, it's a huge selling point for the uni.

false,Fimmschig,null,null,"I made the definition myself.

Authentic consent refers to what somebody is intrinsically motivated and willing to do, rather than forced to submit to through extrinsic coercions and obligations. Authentic consent exists, for example, in sex based on mutual attraction and trust, as is the case in typical non-commercial sex, whether casual or in a relationship. It does not, however, exist during rape, even though a rape victim may ""consent"" to submit instead of producing active resistance which may lead to even greater injury or harm. The psychological harm of rape is a function of authentic consent, not legal consent. As a result, the trauma sustained by some prostituted women in similar to that of victims of torture and ""regular"" rape.

""Authentic consent"" is also used in some literature to include the dimensions of power and autonomy. Power is a person's capacity to control and constrain another person's thoughts and behaviors. Rape relies on such a power differential, in that the rapist uses power (physical or psychological) to gain sexual access without authentic consent. Autonomy is the person's freedom to choose another option without substantial negative consequences.

Retracting consent is not a viable option if you have a formal and legal agreement not to do so, and need to keep feigning consent in order to fulfill the obligation and keep the income you need to survive. The prostituted woman is expected to submit to the rape and suppress and hide any revulsion and unwillingness she experiences. Retracting consent can cause a loss of income, reputation, employment as well as being potentially dangerous because the john may feel that he is entitled to ""get his money's worth"". We have an understanding in the culture that breaking promises is immoral, so the prostituted woman with such a moral belief will feel that she is morally obligated to accept the rape lest she be immoral.

Don't forget women in prostitution do not go into prostitution because they desperately want to be coerced into sex. They know that there is male demand for coercing women into sex, and they can choose to submit to that demand so as to have income to sustain their livelihood. The root problem is men wanting to do so by disregarding women's sexual boundaries. If not getting raped is a human right, then it should not be possible to rape someone for money, just as you should not be able to kill someone for money if life is a human right.",0,1414502086,null,0,false,0,clm39c0,t3_2kg6jh,t1_clm39c0,t1_clm2n71,null,1426310496,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

4-3-3 with both of them in the side which requires one of them to act as a winger. Suarez and Sturridge pulled this formation off several times but both of them seem better tactically than Balotelli. We have seen that Balotelli is not the best up front - so we can try him on the wing when using that formation. He has shown that he can do dirty work - whether he could be so disciplined the entire game is yet to be known, I guess. And he has played there in the past so nothing that new to him. 

The third member of the attacing trio would be Sterling which leaves Lallana and Coutinho fight for the position in midfield. As they can also play on the wing we can give Sterling more rest if needed. 

This formation and gameplan was used in some of the most enjoyable games last season (Everton, Arsenal @ home). Also, Suarez wasn't the main man in that formation (he was like a cog in a machine player) and it gives me hope that we can replicate similar performances again.

Probably not, because everyone's too greedy and stupid to do anything sensible, and everybody in power is an idiot, a drunk, a coke addict, a weasel, corrupt, lazy or incompetent. Often all of them together.

Few months later he was deployed to Afghanistan and in his first 2 weeks out there stepped on an IOD. Came back to the UK missing both of his legs but he never once let it get him down. He's still the man I remember showing off the beret, he's still at the gym, married to a beautiful woman and does all of these wheelchair racing events.

Dear David Gauke MP,

On Thursday there is a rare chance to debate our drug laws.                     
                                                                                
The attempt to prohibit (some) drugs has been an ongoing, costly failure.  Estimates vary but we may be spending £400/year/person enforcing this, money which I'd quite like back.  Not to mention the amount of money that is being given to criminals which could be taken in taxes instead.
                                                                                
We should protect, not criminalize the young.  In particular we should regulate sales of cannabis to stop young people buying it.  Dealers will sell to anyone.  We should deal with addiction as a health problem, not a criminal problem.

It's now a good time to end this nonsense, and implement evidence-based policies.  Specifically  I would like you to support the call for an impact assessment of the Misuse of Drugs Act (1971).

Ok, now pretend you're the government that has done this successfully - which would be awesome by the way - but now explain to your nation why the money is going to another continent and not to that nations own health service or infrastructure or whatever. 

...You might not send all the money, but you'd need to send enough to make a difference to a whole continent, after all. 

Don’t get me wrong (and I’m sorry to repeat it but don’t want to be mistaken) – I’m not glad to see anyone die or drown or suffer. I’m really not. 

But I am realistic that A) they’re choosing to cross a body of water. They’re not being forced (granted conditions may be horrible, but unless they’re being herded onto boats they can’t control at gunpoint – they do have some control over their situation) and we have been picking up the pieces if it goes wrong. 

As a nation we’re not exactly walking streets paved with gold. We have it better than they do but as you say it’s not a race to the bottom. It’s selfish, but no more so than any other nation that’s not offering aid. When we’re in a better fiscal position then absolutely we can help the world – but if we’re facing austerity, cuts, higher costs etc. here – we’re evidently not in a position to also be spending money elsewhere in the world.

Fought off 9 sanctions this year, all overturned after it was found that Avanta were sending my appointment letters to other claimants addresses and sending me other claimants appointment letters. I even had to go as far as getting my local MP involved on the 8th one as I went 5 weeks waiting for a reply only to get told that they had no record of my appeal (which was done in person at the local jobcentre). On the plus side though, it's the first time I've had to get in touch with an MP and he assigned his secretary to my case who phoned me each morning assuring me that she was still getting in contact with people to get it sorted. It came down to her having to use the MPs email address and my problem was sorted the same afternoon she sent it.

Avanta did get me a job though, which lasted under a week. I was made to take up employment cold calling people to try and flog solar panels. 16 of us started, by the end of the week 4 people remained, we weren't hitting our targets of 2 appointments per day. Then I had to go through the hassle of signing back on and I actually ended up losing out on money.

They've gotten rid of those books now, you're given a personal planner instead in which you have to write down in advance what you're going to be doing the following two weeks. Using the directgov site is now mandatory else you'll face a sanction.

I'm still on it and for the past 6 weeks I've been mandated to attend the jobcentre daily (barr from this week as my advisor is off). I did get an interview at the local NHS 3 weeks ago for a 3 month voluntary position (I've previously worked for the NHS for 5 years). I didn't get it though, there were 32 of us fighting over around ten to fifteen placements, so the odds seemed good, but that included portering, finance (which is what I opted for) and ward helpers.

I have no beef with the advisors at the jobcentre themselves, all of the ones I've been appointed to in the past have seemed to have gone above and beyond what I'd expect (in one case one of them had spent 3 hours of his morning trying to sort out the mess of my sanctions after Avanta started with their fuck ups).

I've signed up to start my bsc in mathematics and statistics come January so I'll be moving over to student loans, it'll be a nice change to not have to worry week in and week out with whether I'm going to have to fight off another unwarranted sanction and give myself something to actually do in my time.

*edit*

One thing that got me fuming a fair bit though was when I sent in a complaint to the jobcentre about how I was getting treat at Avanta and the sanctions they were trying to pass through. Guess where that complaint ended up going? Straight to the desk of my advisor at Avanta, who proceeded to tell (shout at) me that I was trying to start up arguments before getting herself so worked up that she told me she needed to go and sit in the staff room to calm herself down, leaving me at her desk for 15 minutes surrounded by her colleagues that blamed me for the way she was reacting. On her return she walked straight past her desk without even acknowledging I was still there and went to speak to her manager. Her manager came over and tried claiming that I had told them about these change of addresses, I hadn't and she couldn't back it up with any paperwork.

When I actually did move addresses in March of this year, I was told that I couldn't tell Avanta directly, that I had to inform the jobcentre and they themselves would inform Avanta. So I did that, only 4 weeks later and another sanction comes through. They hadn't enacted my change of address form. An investigation was taken place (this was that morning my jobcentre advisor spent 3 hours working on it) and my form magically turned up, it had been sat in Avanta and not actioned, so my appointment letters were going to my old address.",0,1414503667,null,0,1414504751,0,clm3v0m,t3_2kjsgo,t1_clm3v0m,t1_clm35n4,null,1426310215,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

The same way we justify loads and loads of other things at the moment 'to stop the immigrants'. Seems like that sentiment appeals to the voters, lately.

A somewhat less vote-winning line would be to appeal to the spirit of common humanity. But that's hardly good politics.

If I had to deal with the crime, war, poverty, disease, that is endemic in some African nations, I think I'd try for the boats, too. Yes, they make the choice to try and cross, but if they stay, they may be choosing genital mutilation. *May*. Obviously not all of them are, I won't pretend everywhere on the continent is as bad as the worst place on the continent, but sometimes 'oh I'll just stay here' isn't a choice anyone would take in their position.

&gt; When we’re in a better fiscal position then absolutely we can help the world – but if we’re facing austerity, cuts, higher costs etc. here – we’re evidently not in a position to also be spending money elsewhere in the world.

Those who put us in this terrible fiscal position remain unpunished, while we use the current state of affairs to justify leaving people to drown.

I'm not going to pretend I have all the answers, and I concede that with the world as it, with people being how people are, my suggested solutions have less an almost-nil probability of being the action eventually taken.

Ballo hasn't been great, granted (nothing like what people are making out) but its not like we paid 30mil for him.

I'm personally reserving all judgement until he plays a few with Danny because he has never been and never will be an out and out 9, so it's unfair judging him on that.

Also, Bony has had one a decent season in the premier league he has not been decent for a while. By this logic, they should have gone and bought a number of different strikers but certainly not Wilfred Bony.

I sometimes feel like wearing a white poppy represents an ostentatious desire to stand-out, borne out of some delusion that everyone around you just *has* to know what your opinion of war is. It seems so childish to demand attention like that. It's particularly offensive given that most of us are remembering people who had no choice in fighting the war, and were instead conscripted. 

* I am fine that you're a pacifist - I think it's quite a naive stance but I respect it

not sure i understand that question, or if you understood my description.

the government will top up your pension fund by 20% of whatever you pay into it.  the returns you earn on the fund depend on what is invested in, and the government have no influence in that.

so if you invest £100 in a pension fund that will earn 5% per year the following will happen:

-£100 in

- government adds £20 on day 1 (total = £120)

- after 1 year the total will grow by 5% (total = £126)

i should point out that you do pay tax on a some of your pension when you withdraw it (ie: when you are retired), but it does have considerable tax benefits (perhaps not directly comparable with an ISA).

Most would suggest prioritising people over unnecessary projects whether it is tackling corporate tax evasion or Trident. Whatever issue that is suggested you can counter and say it's valuable but that's just because we have different priorities.

Check out the comments I mention in the article – I couldn’t see any arguments, just quips about the government being inhumane. I don’t say it to score points – but the overriding consensus seemed to be ‘Down with this sort of thing… with no suggestion of a solution or workaround’. 

I appreciate it’s a selfish point of view to take – but I prioritise the wellbeing of the people in this country first and foremost. If we can’t look after ourselves then we can’t expect to look after the rest of the planet. 

If we’re being told (on a daily basis) that each person must band together in the face of austerity, debt, financial difficulties and that we must see people put out of work, hospitals closed, cutbacks across public and private sectors… 

…then how can we prioritise fielding operations to people thousands of miles away who aren’t victim of some immediate natural disaster but are choosing a dangerous path to escape their own unpleasant situation? 

It’s cold – I know – but since we’re struggling to put things right *here* then we should certainly cut back spending *there*. We should rightly expect support from a lot of other countries who could and should take up some of that slack. It’s not as though the people we’re saving in this context have any direct ties with the UK – so why are we picking them and not others in difficulty all around the world? 

It’s an inconsistency and hypocrisy that doesn’t make sense.

false,Blaidd_Dwrg,eng-lancashire,Preston,"I don't think it's unreasonable to expect an employer to look out for the interests of its employees.

That said I had another read through the Act myself and it's not quite as clear-cut on the issue as I remember. Setting up an all-white company definitely would be covered under the Act as below:

&gt; An employer (A) must not discriminate against a person (B)—
&gt; (a)in the arrangements A makes for deciding to whom to offer &gt; employment;
&gt; (b)as to the terms on which A offers B employment;
&gt; (c)by not offering B employment.

Having a policy of providing white drivers on demand (and thus denying work to non-white drivers would almost certainly be covered by the above; failing that see below:

&gt;A person (A) harasses another (B) if—
&gt;(a)A engages in unwanted conduct related to a relevant protected &gt;characteristic, and
&gt;(b)the conduct has the purpose or effect of—
&gt;(i)violating B's dignity, or
&gt;(ii)creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive &gt;environment for B.

As for your ""regular client"" example, I think that's a bit of a grey area. On the one hand the client would have engaged in ""unwanted conduct"" as per the above definition, and the employer has a duty to prevent this as below:

&gt;The circumstances in which A is to be treated as harassing B under &gt;subsection (1) include those where—
&gt;(a)a third party harasses B in the course of B's employment, and
&gt;(b)A failed to take such steps as would have been reasonably practicable to prevent the third party from doing so.

On the other hand it could be argued that, by complying with the client's wishes, the employer is actually taking ""steps as would have been reasonably practicable to prevent the third party from"" harassing the employee, as they would be avoiding a situation where the driver could be subjected to racist comments from the client. However if multiple regulars make the same request then complying with them all would clearly disadvantage non-white drivers.

I would suggest that in order to avoid falling foul of equality law, taxi firms should adopt a policy of ""You get the driver you're given. If you want a white driver, tough, the law says we can't discriminate against our employees. If you have a concern about a specific driver's behaviour, please get in touch and we will investigate and take appropriate action."" I'm a layman though not a law-talking-guy so the above is merely my inexpert interpretation.

There are a number of guides available that can help with interpreting the law:

Depends what you want to do.   Getting out as a steward/scaffolder/rigger/painter etc is easier because they require experience in the field and maybe a couple of qualifications.   The more advanced/technical positions require relative industry experience, so you're talking power plant, chemical plant, refinery type work. 

Even then, companies are hesitant to take people on because many can't adjust to the lifestyle of being away from home for weeks at a time. 

You also require offshore survival qualifications, at any level.  To be honest, most people that get a position, only do so because of years experience in their field, a positive word from a friend, or working up from an apprenticeship level.  It's really not an easy industry to break into.
