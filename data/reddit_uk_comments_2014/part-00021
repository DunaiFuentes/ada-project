true,terahurts,eng-lincolnshire,"Cleethorpes, definitely not Grimsby","Children both over the age of 21 so no CB or CTC, both are currently looking for work on JSA.

£250 is the average over four weeks, We get two ESA payments of £230, one DLA payment of £300 and four CA payments of £60 for a total of ~£1000 or £250/week.  The boys pay us a token tenner a week for rent out of their JSA which gets put in the pot for a rainy day/freezer week.

The loan was from the social fund back when we had one to cover the cost of moving home and replacing a cooker.  Around £450 IIRC.  As far as smoking goes, it's about 1/5 of what we were spending on proper tabs when we were both working.  We've both tried quitting several times (cold turkey, patches, e-cigs, gum etc etc) but unfortunately never managed to kick the habit entirely.

We could save a few quid on broadband costs, and maybe a fiver by dropping to the lowest tariff on my mobile (Boys are PAYG and pay for their own credit, wife is housebound and doesn't need one), but then I'd end up paying for data and calls both of which are free at the moment.  Reducing the broadband speed is more hassle than it's worth to be honest, if we were struggling to pay the bills every month then I'd do so, but we're not.  It's my wife's lifeline to the rest of her family as well as being pretty much our sole source of entertainment. 

We manage to save money every month, even if it's only £20 or £30.  Yeah, we're never going to be able to afford a trip to Disney World or a five star restaurant but we're not starving and I'm sitting in a warm room so we do OK.

true,BadBoyFTW,eng-derbyshire,Derbyshire,"&gt; I can't believe she made such a similar elemental mistake in trying to pretend to be like the little people.

I think the mistake you've made here is that she's not a politician.

She's just somebody who makes a fortune by doing one thing; being controversial.

She'll just say and do whatever she can to be the most controversial figure she possibly can be. She'll be the dumbass everyone wants her to be in television. I wouldn't be surprised if she deliberately made it look like she didn't know what she was doing, because otherwise it wouldn't be so annoying and controversial.

She learned from being on The Apprentice that she got the most attention because she was a massive bitch to everyone. She got the most interviews, she got the most coverage. Why? By being a huge controversial bitch. And she has been very successful at it... do you see anybody else from her season of The Apprentice on TV? Can you remember their names? I sure can't... so she continues to do so... that's her 'brand'. Thats what she's selling. She isn't a politician running for office or a activist working towards some future political goal... she's just a huge bitch who makes money from being controversial.

Then they invite her on the show so she gets viewers to watch who hate her and her fake opinions believing them to be true. So the television show wins because ratings go up and Katie wins because she pockets a bunch of cash.

The only victim is society, as some morons actually believe she believes the rubbish she spouts and think that others must agree with them too if it's important enough to be on TV.

Then next week she's back on TV again with whatever crazy bullshit shes thought up this time to piss everyone who is rational off. And the cycle continues.

Some of you are acting like football isn't a business or that there are some hidden agendas. On the contrary our clubs seem pretty cool with each other. As far as I'm concerned, we have a professional rivalry, not like what we have with Liverpool or Man City. I do think that Rooney is somehow being promised to you guys, or at least first refusal or something.  

But ya, don't be disrespectful, we are all football fans here. Manchester United is definitely not a step down.

Edit: to explain in a bit more detail - no matter who takes up the extra 25% of apartments it will reduce costs for everyone inc young people. when a 30yr old couple move into one of the 'new' houses they free up whatever they were in before (which is again itself available to anyone who wants it, inc young people). This happening millions of times opens up lots of available apartments - landlords will reduce prices to get theirs rented out more quickly or more easily (since they are now competing with lots of other 'new' apartments or apartments made newly empty by people moving from old stock to the new ones). Yes it is fair to say that the people who currently have the most money AND currently live with their parents will be in a stronger position than those on lower incomes AND live with their parents - but that is of course true for all buying situations. Nevertheless a big influx in properties will give new options to people that werent there before - and that effect multiplied by millions of times will make the market cheaper.

you make it sound as if nobody else/very few people are standing up to it? 

lots and lots and lots of people stand up and are against it, majority of them very vocal about it.. i hear all the time how people are getting named, shamed and arrested over racist tweets, not even just to famous people.

&gt; No matter what people think of Stan Collymore, whatever he think's about Liverpool and whatever his opinions on certain incidents are in a football match shouldn't come into it, he is entitled to his opinion, but it shouldn't ever be used as an excuse to justify racial abuse.

who's trying to justify it? almost 99% of the comments ive seen about it, across multiple sites has been along the lines of 'the racism is disgusting and wrong but he's still a cunt', its not so much people saying they can be racist to him because hes a cunt but rather the racism is wrong but in a separate instance he's also a cunt. The original discussion (how it all started) was how he kicked off at liverpool fans after he said they dived and a lot of people disagreed and then he came out with that cunty 'fucks off in july' tweet, thats when the abuse started and thats when it turned into a race issue. From my perspective although he was very right to telll people he was getting racial abuse he sort of turned it into a big issue to cover the fact that he was being a cunt.

&gt; he is entitled to his opinion

as are most people's comments about him, they think hes wrong, a lot of the other pundits think hes wrong and so people have said so, he got annoyed at the backlash and kicked off.

What gets me and i think the majority of other people, is that he baited the argument, got people wound up with that suarez 'fucks off in July' tweet and when all the focus was on him he deflected the negative attention he was getting away into a race issue. 

I don't even need to say or explain why racism is never justifiable but he went about it all the wrong way.

 Instead of saying 'getting a lot of racist abuse ill be reporting them to the police' he made a big show of it and started replying to every comment racist or not with YNWA, even to people who very clearly were not liverpool fans and he uploaded that picture of LFC with the caption 'keep it' and he made and deleted that tweet saying something along the lines off 'racist liverpool fans, nothing changes', literally hours after it all went down he was still their baiting fans and retweeting every single pro collymore/anti liverpool tweet he could. 


Its not so much that he's 'publicly standing up to the racism' but rather how he got the abuse, announced it and then continued to post all his snarky insultish tweets afterwards",0,1390385131,null,0,1390385450,0,cevum5q,t3_1vstiu,t1_cevum5q,t1_cevuekf,null,1432052503,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Because the market is free (everybody is open to buy or rent whatever property they like) there aren't any significant factors that would affect the reduction in prices described by supply &amp; demand. For example if houses had a crazy tax that kicked in at a certain price (they sort of do with stamp duty, but it is relatively low and tapered) it would suppress prices. If people were obliged to have 2 house that would (perversely) increase prices since demand would be sky high. Its the same reason why reason why house are so much cheaper in Sunderland vs Surrey - because the demand is much lower there (there are plenty to go around) - so the prices are lower. House prices  fell 2009-2011 because less people wanted to move into a house - demand reduced - effectively supply was better.... these 'theories' have been describing the housing market for hundreds of years - today is no different. 

&gt; but economics isn't as nice and neat as you're making it out to be

??? economics isnt nasty or nice it is just a description of what happens in a market. but if you think that falling prices is a result of supply increase is *nice* then yes it is nice. Think cheaper DVD players as supply increased in the 90s and 00s - that was nice wasn't it?

Seriously just because *in your head* you can think of a reason why supply and demand might not apply, *doesn't* mean it won't apply! The basic premise - that rich people would buy up the supply of stuff as soon as more is available keeping the price high - is deeply flawed.

 The mentality is that if you want to look for a higher paying job, you do it on your own time and you take the first available job(not least becasue it makes it much easier to find a better job if you're already employed) or refuse it and support yourself. 

&gt;As long as you're looking for work and applying for relevant jobs to your ambitions and qualifications I'm not arsed.

you may not be arsed, but the people paying £100 for you to apply to 2 jobs a week might be a little arsed.

but if you can't find those higher paying jobs you want, doesnt that make you the idiot with no qualifications? experience is a better and more valid qualification these days than most degrees, therefore people wiht a non professional degree and no work experience belong working in Costa

true,lbspredh,null,null,"you sound like my best friend, we argue pretty much this long into the night sometimes.

And I see your point, I know pretty much how money is created and it's a scam etc. but what i'm saying is that changing the rules even drastically isnt going to change who ends up owning the money, these measures have been used successfully to a degree but by no means have they sorted out the money problems of the societies they are used in.

Even if you get around the fact that the poeople holding the money have all the power to stop the democratic process from fundamentally changing the rules to their detriment, even if the creation of money is changed, the people with real economic power still own so many of the assets and have such political pull that taking back the assets is impossible, and having the assets will allow them to claw back everything these changes will cost them, end result being back to square one. 

This can only lead me to the conclusion that the only way to make the economy fair or functional for the benefit of people requires either centuries of slow changes to attitudes, or a cataclysmic worldwide anarchy forming that collapses the whole system, and I don't think the latter would be a great option in any short term capacity

Get in Lidl on the tills or die! Lets just forget peoples aspirations and desires in life, they are all leeches to society for wanting a job that they might excel in and enjoy.

Ok stop ranting it's undignified and immature. I expect better from redditors.

This isn't a tory phenomenon and I'm not a troy. Any government would want to encourage people to find employment.

 Welfare is a safety net. It always has been a safety net, it is there for people in genuine need. If you are refusing gainful and reasonable employment for no better reason than wanting a better job you are not in need. It is a simple fact that having a job-any job makes it easier to find a better job than coming from a position of unemployment. From just these two facts it makes no sense at all for you to give up a job in favour of getting JSA. It's just such a childish mentality that you can swan into a high paying graduate level job with no work experience, that's as out of touch with reality as any tory policy you can decry.

&gt;Face the facts, there are not enough quality jobs out there because of the massive lack of funds and investment by the government.

I agree, but that doesnt change the reality that you are underqualified for graduate work and it doesn't give you the right to just do nothing and depend when you are perfectly capable of supporting yourself.

&gt;hateful, racist, people like yourself

Grow up. Nothing I said has a damn thing to do with race this is typical hysteria that comes out of the mouths of opinionated people who can't take their views being questioned without going off on an irrelevant tangent.

Most of them should appreciate that you worked for a living doing something different mainly because there weren't enough opening spaces at your intended industry.

The same way that governments have been trying to shut down p2p networks for years. It's very difficult to wipe out the Bitcoin network. The best that they could do would cause a shock to the price to try and undermine bitcoin but it's not the first and wouldn't be the last issue that Bitcoin faces.

&gt;Bitcoins value is based entirely on the emotion of its investors.

If you really understand financial markets you will know that your statement applies to the vast majority of what is being traded. Very little has real intrinsic value in this world. Gold for example. It's not traded because it's actually worth $1200 an ounce. It's value would be significantly lower if not for all the world banks and investors who believe in gold as a reserve 'currency'. If you took that part of the gold market away the intrinsic value (it's industrial/retail users) would be much much lower than what it's selling for today.

Something must have seriously unsettled you in order to dedicate this much time to constantly fighting a losing battle in the comments of obscure cycling subreddits... I am curious. Why do this?

I don't want to downvote you and move on. As a cyclist and a driver, I'm keen to understand why this is such a big deal to you. There are barely any bikes on the roads compared to all the cars. At the moment, I (and 80% of my fellow adult cyclists) also own a fully taxed, insured car, and choose to leave it at home to commute by bike just because it's nicer than sitting in traffic and fuel is expensive. My car is better for long-distance adventures in the countryside. 

Presumably, your aim is that we all stop riding bikes and ""getting in the way"". But if you got what you wanted and the PM banned cycling tomorrow, you realise we'd all just get in our cars too for the morning commute, and add to traffic that holds you up?

Fewer cars means better roads for drivers. This country has a huge traffic congestion problem at the moment, and that's why I support cycling. Think of how many one-passenger cars mostly full of empty space slow down your journeys at the moment - put them all on bikes and your car journey would be faster.

Obviously being from Liverpool I despise England and Man United so to see two utter clowns helped into management positions there by the southern little Englanders is most amusing.  It's great fun watching their two most hallowed idols fall apart.

Whilst PACE unified the procedures (as per Code A) and took on the mantle of stolen goods/items for use in fraud/prohibited articles etc., the actual enumerated powers come from the individual acts - so a drugs search would be under the auspices of s23 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, a search for badger baiting equipment would be as per the Badgers Act, or the Deer Act if you were looking at someone skulking about in a royal park with a funny hat.

true,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,"I'm happy to agree to disagree.  Neither AVB nor Sherwood have seemed to have a lot of faith in Siggy, and I don't feel like he's done a lot on the pitch to suggest otherwise.  His goalscoring record this season has definitely been good considering his limited opportunities and how bad we were at the start of the season, but it's one of those situations where I feel that yes, he's scored some goals, but his overall play and involvement makes his inclusion less appealing.  I don't want any player in our shirt to struggle, and I'm happy to be proven wrong about him.  If he comes into the team and starts scoring and setting up goals, I'll happily admit my mistake.

In terms of our other options, I think Holtby is a different type of player who can play deeper.  He has better energy and movement, and looks to get involved more.  His touch isn't as classy as Siggy's, but I feel like he's constantly looking to make things happen, which I can't necessarily say about Gylfi.

I'm not Chadli's biggest fan by any means, but again, he offers something Siggy doesn't.  He's got strength and size in his favour, which could come in handy if Ade can't play.  I think he's played very cautiously for us so far, but he can be a real flair player if given the chance (which he was more at Twente).  He's more versatile and is a better option on the left wing, as he's more two-footed and doesn't cut inside as much, plus is more defensively disciplined.  We haven't by far seen the best from him, but I don't necessarily think he's going to be our next superstar either.  I just feel he offers more than Siggy at this point in time.

Personally I don't have anything (fortunately) that I can relate to as I am a white male of no religious background, no poor background nor any rich background. I'm that middle ground of, for lack of a better word, untouchable when it comes to racism/hate crimes. But fortunately it means I can take any dig at my and turn the other cheek as there is nothing that can offend me [that isn't something I can personally do to change I.E not about my personality or tastes]. I hope that doesn't sound to ""self-entitled arrogant white guy"". 
But yeah, the co-owner, I would've thought it'd just be a ""WTF are your players doing that for, sort it out or we're done"" not a single incident (at this club [I think]) and they're pulling out. Given the sources you just provided to do with his partnerships, I would say it's very hypocritical that you support those who hate the ""Jooz muzzlums and emergrants"" because they killed Diana and made the weather bad. 

And in relation to WBA's position man, think of yourselves in Cardiffs shoes. Cardiff aren't a big brand in the Prem, they're currently in their first season. You're like Sunderland and Norwich. You're not expected to win the league by any means but you're not necessarily expected to be playing Championship football regularly. You've hunkered down and unfortunately you may think you're fighting for survival, which you probably are, but it's when your team and fans start thinking like that you may find your morale slipping thus becoming the new Rovers and dropping down after X amount of semi-successful and successful seasons in the top flight. 

Support your team man, make sure your fans stay loyal. Not to the racist player, but to the badge they're wearing on their chest and the ground they play in week after week.

Edit: for the record HMIC said that a 12 percent cut could be absorbed without significant damage to front line policing, TM went with 20, then started ""top slicing"" the remainder.

It's far more likely the market will just remain very ill-liquid for a long long time and youngsters in particular will suffer for it. Then at some point in about 15-25 years time the people that own that property are going to have to start selling it to fund their under-funded pensions.

Mata serves a role in our squad that no other player can. He's still a vital player and will be useful against teams like Stoke, whom we play this week.

You clearly have very little understanding of FFP. Firstly, we are well within the boundaries of FFP for this season. If we were to sell Mata, or any player for that matter, we'd be better off selling them in the summer, so they can count to next season's books, rather than this season where we're already compliant. 

Man United are always a threat in the league. They do, in fact, have some world class players, but have been dealt a shit hand with injuries. They're also one of the biggest clubs in the world, they'll always manage to attract players. And, if they have Mata in their team, with soon-to-be-fit Rooney and RVP, it is highly likely that they nab that 4th CL spot.

Your arguments are futile and I honestly can not see one benefit to selling Mata to Utd this transfer window. Like you said, Mata is a fantastic player, and will get plenty of game time with us this season (especially with the FA Cup and CL coming into play soon). Reducing ourselves to 4 players in the attacking band will ensure that we crash somewhere along the way.

Ireland - ""Free"", but the way they keep increasing the Student Levy (currently €2500) they might as well make them fee paying, so it can be paid off when you can afford it, not up front. (I studied in Ireland)

France - I think that is pretty nominal, can't be sure.

Germany - Bigger population, but it varies from state to state. [Two \(Lower Saxony and Bavaria\) charge €500 per semester plus €50 registration fee per semester. All the other just charge the registration fee](http://www.studyineurope.eu/study-in-germany/tuition-fees). According, to /u/Xaethon, this may be changing to no fees. As it is it is state managed though, there are smaller populations involved.

Netherlands - c. €1700 per annum. A lot more if you choose to do a second masters now. (also studied in NL)

Scandinavia is (mostly?) free. But smaller population and high tax pay for this.

Just some countries that I thought I would mention.

true,Pikul,lfc87,null,"Plenty of people stand up to it of course, I hardly think he's the first person to ever raise the issue of racism.

I saw the ""Fucks off in July"" Tweet and didn't think much of it to be honest, maybe a person in the media shouldn't come out with a comment like that, but still, it isn't that bad really. I saw bits and pieces of what followed like retweeting the ""murderers""  tweet and while it's a very cuntish thing to do and he shouldn't have done it, you can say he invited the abuse on to himself with Tweets like that but it's not an excuse for someone to send him racial abuse or threatening to kill him.

It may be true that he's purposefully deflecting the attention of his cuntish Tweets to the racist abuse he gets to protect himself, but honestly, what's the bigger issue? If he had ignored the racial Tweets and kept going on about Suarez' dive or replaying to people abusing him(people calling him a prick, cunt or whatever else) and being a cunt about it then nothing much was going to come from it, people would just think he's a cunt and I'm sure there's many that already do. If he continued to do that he'd still be getting a bit of attention and would probably get an extra bit of interest in his next show because people would want to hear what he's got to say on it.

People already think Collymore is a cunt, and I don't think the negative attention he was getting would have changed much to be honest in that aspect and people would have forgotten about it by next week.

Instead he's decided to take a bigger stand against racism. While he's drumming up interest in himself and his show, he's also drawing attention the racism issue. I believe he has reported racial abuse to the police several times before and they have followed up on it with arrests, but it hasn't changed much as he is still subject to abuse so maybe he feels that becoming more vocal about it now, which he has done this morning, might well change something. If Twitter take a more serious action against racial Tweets, then at least he's achieved something.

He's a well known person in football media and whether we like it or not, he has an influence, he's got over half a million followers on Twitter and I imagine his radio show does decent numbers too, that's a lot of people that he can spread his message to. Granted, he's not the first person in football to raise the issue, there's the kick it out campaign, Uefa's Respect campaign etc. but I think the ordinary everyday match goer, barstooler or armchair pundit will relate to Collymore and take a greater interest in the issue due to what he has to say about his experiences, whereas I don't think seeing players wearing kick it out shirts while warming up or seeing Benzema and Seedorf swapping shirts on a television advert will have as much of an affect on them.

I've kinda rambled more than anything with this. I just think that what Collymore is doing at the moment is a good thing, and is a bit more than him trying to cover up his cuntish actions on Twitter.

Definition of unemployment: 

Unemployed people in the UK are:

&gt;""without a job, have actively sought work in the last four weeks and are available to start work in the next two weeks or;

&gt;out of work, have found a job and are waiting to start it in the next two weeks""

So if you haven't declared that that you're looking for a job you are placed under the ""economic inactivity"" definition.

Also the Labour Force Survey (LFS) carry out unemployment related surveys pick out 100,000 people at random over 40,000 household at random by postcode and provide the average. They even say the rate of uncertainty is estimated at 3%. So where unemployment has decreased by 0.5%, it may have increased by 2.5%.

true,strolls,null,null,"The problem with this is that it places the cost of failure upon the student.

For every 100 students that attend university, there's going to be some number that fail their exams or drop out. Might only be 1% or 2%, might be 10% or 20%, I have no idea, but some will fail.

In the tory right-wing view of the world, it is indeed the student's fault - if you attend university then it's your ""responsibility"" to pass. ""We're paying for it, we're not paying for you to fail"".

I compare this to manufacturing, in which a percentage of product - whether that be glass bottles or printed circuit boards - will be expected to fail QA. That's why factories have QA in the first place - to detect those bottles or circuit boards which aren't good enough, and to prevent them being sent to customers.

But when a glass bottle or a printed circuit board fails quality assurance, we don't blame it, and chide it for it's flaws. We don't send the bottle a bill and demand it pay for the money we wasted on its manufacture - instead we recycle the materials and hope to get it right next time.

I appreciate it's easy to criticise a comparison of people with inanimate objects, but it's inevitable that some students will fail and drop out from university, and in the real world, people do so for a variety of reasons, many of them beyond their own control.

Maybe Mitchell chose to study history because he had poor career guidance, perhaps it's just perfectly normal for 18 year old youngsters not to know what they want to do with their lives.

Someone might drop out of university following a bereavement, or because they have an abusive partner or they're the victim of rape or depression. ""Oh, here you go"", we say, ""have a bill for £10,000 per year"".

I agree with other comments here that it's probably too many to have a goal of 50% of school leavers attending university - I'd rather see more carpenters and plumbers and so on. But, having a smaller number qualifying, I honestly think it's better for society for us to accept sponsorship of the failures. I think it's probably better for people to be allowed education for education's sake - even if it doesn't turn a profit in every instance, it'll probably turn a profit overall.

Placing the cost of tuition upon the student is what economists and political theorists call a ""regressive"" measure - by placing the burden ""equally"" on each individual, in fact it places a disproportionate burden on the poor.

For myself, it's no problem - if one of my kids studies history for a year before dropping out, I can easily afford to write off that £10,000 of tuition and say ""you daft bastard, take a year off, get a part time job, figure out what you want to do with yourself; don't mess it up next time"".

If my kid comes back to me a year later and says ""I want to study something else"" then I can easily afford to put him or her through a PPE degree; if my kid says ""I need a loan so I can start a business selling electric guitars and designer t-shirts"", I can help with that, too.

This is not true for kids growing up on council estates, however - for them repaying the loan may mean that they take home less money each month after some future promotion and pay-rise, after they've reestablished themselves after dropping out and ""finding"" themselves.

The UK used imperial measurements up until the around the beginning of the 1970s. At around that time, metrication was introduced with the aim of converting the UK to metric measurements.

However, the scheme was abandoned before it was complete, so now we have a mixture of units. Miles are common currency when talking about distance, so young people don't really talk about how many kilometres away a place is, but are probably more likely to talk about smaller lengths in centimetres than inches.

By law, food must be sold in kilograms and litres rather than pounds and ounces and pints and gallons, but many foods are still implicitly sold in the old units (eg, you can still buy jam in jars labelled 340g or 454g, which equates to 12oz or 1lb, respectively).

If you fancy some gritty investigative journalism;

- The filter systems came out at roughly the same time on the PM's 'pressure'. How were the ISPs able to implement so quickly?
- Are the filtering systems all the same box from the same manufacturer? What else can the box do? Who supplied it?
- The ISPs lobbied together against monitoring and logging proposals in the Data Communications Bill (actual legislation, unlike this) on the basis of cost and practicality - why is this any different?

If someone were to threaten you, and you defended yourself by kicking them, and they sustained a broken leg then well its hard cheese for them. If on the other hand you just decided to kick someone in the leg for no reason or in order to attack them then it would be an assault, it would be an assault regardless of the damage done. The level of injury would only determine if it was common assault, assault occasioning actual bodily harm or assault occasioning grievous bodily harm. In the case of a broken leg, it would be classified as GBH, an offence under section 20 of the offences against the person act. It wouldn't be a section 18 GBH with intent to do GBH, unless they intended to cause such harm. 

Were they justified in using force in this situation. By her own admission it seems, she was obstructing a constable in the course of their duty. That means that legally, yes they may use force, both section 3 of the criminal law act and section 117 of PACE (they were trying to arrest a suspect) would apply. Possibly common law self defence if they felt she meant to attack them.

The question therefore is was the amount of force used reasonable? The officer has to make a dynamic threat assessment. In a hostile crowd, trying to arrest offender, unknown party keeping us held in crowd, threat assessment is going to greatly elevated. If the officer was holding the arm of a suspect then they may only have their legs to defend themselves. If she was told to ""get back"" or ""get off him"" and didn't do so the officer would be justified in delivering further strikes. There is also a home office approved kick/leg strike which would be aimed below the knee and may cause such damage.

Will you eat your other sock when mata doesn't play a minute against west ham  or city like he hasn't since he was hauled off against southampton 4 league games ago? And we should turn down 40 million so he can play Stoke in the FA cup to give our other players a rest?

Mata will play in the FA cup im sure, but in mourinho's system, schurrle and ramires are far more suitable for pressing and breaking with pace, and this is clearly the identity Mourinho has in mind to impose. The matic signing also suggests reverting to a 4-3-3 for the bigger games which puts Mata even further down the pecking order. 

United have always been a threat in the modern era for one reason, ferguson. Moyes clearly doesn't come close to his ability and has never shown anything to suggest he will. The exact same thing happened with liverpool when souness took over from dalglish, and look where they've been since. This is unprecedented territory for united, so don't assume they'll bounce back with one signing of a luxury number 10 (look how kagawa has been handled by moyes, will it be any different with mata?).

RVP is getting on and moyes clearly overtrained him preseason, resulting in a relapse into his old long term injury problems. Rooney is looking for a quick exit from united and won't stay when they inevitably don't get into the CL. Name me one other world class player who is consistently performing in that squad? There has been nothing to suggest a turn around and consistency in form all season and with no CL and moyes in charge, why would any top class player want to join when teams like city, chelsea, psg, monaco, madrid, barca, bayern (even arsenal!) have money to burn and the squads to actually compete?

Mata isn't just going to stroll in there and make them title contenders, he doesn't even fit into their system if Rooney and RVP get to last season's level as you think they will. The PL is changing, and while teams like Arsenal and Liverpool have quietly been transitioning, Ferguson was holding a creaky inbalanced squad together with his incredible motivitational ability.

I think the real question is will Mata even want to go there, but it definitely makes sense for us and our future to sell him. 40m is an extortionate about of money for him when Ozil has just signed from Madrid for that amount. Is Mata even a better number 10 than silva, oscar, hazard, ozil?

Nobody has yet done any analysis to show whether this is caused by a decrease in demand at the bottom end, top end or consistently throughout.  I wouldn't call it disastrous.

I agree with you that it might mean that we can hang on to a low interest rate in the short term though - the Eurozone isn't going to increase their rate from 0.25% with that low growth.  Plus in the UK our stagflation of 2008 - 2012 has meant that we have a large volume of people whose wages haven't risen and prices have, who will are on the edge of financial ruin and an increase in interest rates could cause a dramatic snowball effect.

With some encryption files, there are two passwords. One opens some data you can use as a sacrifice to people who are trying to torture you or otherwise get the password out of you. The other one will reveal your actual information, An outside observer would have no way of knowing at all which was the correct password, unless they knew this information and demanded both passwords, however again this is an additional protection option, not all softwares offer it, and of those that do, none (to my knowledge) make it compulsory to use, so if they asked for two passwords, you could legitimately say you knew only one

So maybe this guy showed the officers the saacrificial information and kept the other info a secret?

If I were caught in this, if this information was known (by whatever means) by anyone interrogating me, I would admit it and state that if you were to access the sacrificial information, as a security measure the real information is deleted, and no-one would know this had happened. I know of encryption softwares that allow for this and it's brilliant - complete protection against interrogation,. I could 'snap', tell them the wrong password, and have them delete any incriminating data for me. They might not even know they have done such a thing either.

While the number of arrests for the White group also decreased during this period, arrests of Black persons rose by 5% and arrests of Asian people by 13%.

&gt;Overall, there were more arrests per 1,000 population of each BME group (except for Chinese or Other) than for people of White ethnicity in 2009/10. Black persons were arrested 3.3 times more than White people, and those from the Mixed ethnic group 2.3 times more.

&gt;On 30 June 2010, the total prison population in England and Wales was 85,002. Of these, 21,878 prisoners (just under 26%) were from BME groups. This proportion is consistent with that recorded from 2006 to 2009 (when it was between 26%–27%). 

26% of the prison population is non-White when they only account for less than 10% of the population. Of course they're going to be searched more often. 

The issue you should be complaining about is crime rates in poor and non-white areas, not accusing the police of racism.

Suarez has it in abundance, Couthino could do with a bit more of it but Allen seems to be completely deficient in this aspect of his game. 

He works hard on his closing down or protecting the ball but too often he comes off second best. We can't live with that in a DM position.  It might work in a few games but when the pressure is really on I wouldn't want Allen to be the one to turn the tide of the battle.

BT and Sky's (and soon Virgin's) came up at around the same time. Cameron promised filtering on UK ISPs 'by the end of 2013'.

Talk talk was 2 years earlier. 

&gt; How were the ISPs able to implement so quickly?

They've been working at this 2012 after a government consultation on the matter. They knew they would have to bring in the technology, but areas of responsibility, costing and branding were up in the air throughout this period. Arguably certain elements are still up in the air.

[ORG break down](https://wiki.openrightsgroup.org/wiki/Content_filtering_by_UK_ISPs) what they know about each ISP's implementation.

I'm not sure why they caved on this issue. I think it's because they saw the opportunity to delivery a product there was some level of customer demand for (based on Talktalk's performance) and through implementing the filters they avoided heavy handed government regulation.

I have to admit that I don't fully see the cost-benefit of this seeds law. But AIUI its intent is to protect consumers who might presently be sold some dodgy hybrid instead of the variety they want.

The goal is to have nurseries and commercial merchants of seeds certify exactly what they're selling, with a detailed description of the leaves, flowers &amp;c of the cultivar.

Superficially, to me, this seems like more effort than is worthwhile, but nevertheless I see no evidence that the legislation will affect grannies swapping seeds over the garden fence.

Even when he filled in pretty well for us at the start of last season he was losing out on these kinds of challenges almost constantly. This isn't UFC, but it's still a physical game and strength matters in more than 1 of the many regular situations that occur through the course of a match.  You also took ""run right through"" way too literally.  It's clearly a reference to being able to shrug off Allen in a 50/50, shoulder to shoulder, or similar type of challenge.

Since when do you have to be tall to be powerful?  Someone like Wayne Rooney is a powerful player but he's not particularly tall by any stretch.  He doesn't really get out-muscled by anyone and it's really hard to push him off the ball.  An opposite example is a player like Peter Crouch, the guy is insanely tall but he is pushed around quite a bit at time, you won't fancy him in a shoulder to shoulder play against someone like Yaya.  And how does physical presence only matter during aerial duels?  Whenever there's body to body contact the strength and power of the player matter.  Be it shoulder to shoulder, going in for a header, protecting the ball, trying to jostle with a player, etc. There's more to it than just strength of course and something Allen is particularly good at is nipping around larger players to just nick the ball from them, but he isn't always going to be in the right position to do that.  

Lucas holds his own, he's a strong player.  He isn't powerful in the sense that he imposes himself on other players like a Yaya or Sandro, but he's strong enough to not be dominated by anyone.  He's our physical steel in the middle of the park, he doesn't get shrugged off the ball and rarely is completely forced aside in any kind of challenge.  Allen doesn't provide that by any means.  I love the guy and he'll run himself into the ground for the team.  He plays fearless and won't back down from anyone, but he's not going to handle a physical battle through the middle.  He's best next to the defensive midfielder where he can use that intelligence to compliment the play of a stronger partner through the middle.  I believe that Allen is the future of our midfield, he has a huge role to play at this club in the future, but it won't be as a DM.  He can do a job there against some midfields, but it won't be consistently good enough against the top clubs and the really big mix of power and technical play they offer.  Against many of the middle and lower sides we can get by with it because we can control the game quite well in possession though.

true,ninereeds314,null,null,"&gt; If I were caught in this, if this information was known (by whatever means) by anyone interrogating me, I would admit it and state that if you were to access the sacrificial information, as a security measure the real information is deleted, and no-one would know this had happened.

That's a movie kind of thing that wouldn't work in the real world.

Data is just data - it doesn't do anything on its own, there's no inherent behaviour built in, it's just a massive collection of ones and zeros. It only changes if something else acts to change it. And even then, there's no magic that changes all copies everywhere to match.

The police don't just switch on your PC and run your encryption software with the password you gave them. They extract the hard disk, use equipment that makes backups without running anything that's on your machine. You could assume they've seen those movies too, or just maybe they care about preservation of evidence anyway.

Then they either use a known safe implementation of the relevant decryption software, or do the decryption on some kind of sandbox system. Even if the decryption destroys the encrypted data, it doesn't matter - it's just destroying one working copy - the preserved copy and original are still safe. Actually, you've provided the police with some information. For a start, there's the fact that you used software that can destroy encrypted files if given the wrong password, which most password-forgetting-prone people probably won't do. Then, if the deletion really was selective - only the still-hidden data was deleted - that software was able to identify which data to delete - and reverse engineering the software and the changes to the file could reveal something about that data - probably how much is still hidden, for instance.

As for the two passwords - yes, I know, e.g. TrueCrypt. IMO the theory behind this is flawed. The police know this can happen too. Corrupt police states aren't known for requiring clear proof that you've definitely committed a crime before punishing you - they can jump to all the conclusions they want. IMO if you use TrueCrypt, you should make sure you use and remember both passwords - so you can disclose both when the police demand them from you. If they can just assume that you know the first password, they can equally just assume that a second password exists and that you know it, whether it really exists or not. If you haven't got a second password, you could go to jail for failing to disclose a password that never existed.

true,Glitter-Herpes,eng-lancashire,Wigan - Land of the Pies,"&gt; Taking a uni course is not adequate to securing you future place of work. It's normally to a student to chose a course, which hopefully will give him an employment  

Isn't that a bit contradictory in terms?  

Anyone with half a brain cell knows full well that it doesn't work in that way ""I will get a degree in X subject, then get a job in X field.""  

It's mostly down to the individual. I had a friend on Facebook who studied Graphic Design and is now complaining she can't find a job. She turned down opportunities whilst studying, to do work placements/experience. Naturally she's blaming the ""shit"" Uni and the ""shit"" course and the ""shit"" teachers. Taking zero responsibility.  

 

Anyone heading to Uni with the mentality of ""I will do this degree in journalism and then become a journalist when I graduate"" are poor misguided fools.  

Sure, a degree will help, but where is that student's portfolio of articles they have had published? Where is that student's work experience? Did they even bother to be an editor or journalist for the Student Union newspaper? A Uni lecturer's job isn't to say ""I suggest you work for the student paper to help"", their job is to say ""What do you think? Use your head.""  

 


One of the main points of studying at University is to teach people to use their own initiative. They're not supposed to offer things to you on a plate (like they do at college and school), they're supposed to teach you to fetch that plate yourself.

true,Miserygut,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;I'm not convinced it will ever really crash - like I said, the OECD have been saying for years that the market is overvalued - but the features of the market that are causing that (high demand, low supply, densely concentrated island living, limited scope for housing expansion, population increase and demographics etc.) are all going to keep the market pegged up. In essence its overvalued but for legitimate reasons. 

You're right the underlying factors point to a continued rise in property prices.

&gt;I don't buy into all the doom-sayers who preach of an inevitable a housing crash.

There are a few factors which will 'shock' the market into a crash: The end of QE, Higher interest rates, Less foreign investment and of course, Increased Supply.

QE is pouring lots of liquidity into the market both here and in the US. This is propping up bank lending and keeping the system going at the moment. It can't last indefinitely. The problem is *when* is a good time to turn off abundant cheap lending? However it is a question of when, not if.

Higher interest rates will shave margins very quickly on those who own property as an investment. With an interest rate rise the price of mortgages and lending go up, increasing costs to the property owner. At the same time, higher interest rates mean that more marginal investments (low returns relative to lending costs) will become less attractive. The one-two effect of this is that BTL investors won't be interested in buying for investment, and home owners won't be able to afford such large mortgages, the result is lower house prices. Interest rates are at historically low levels, and if there's anything we know about markets ignoring historical trends (unless the change is structural) that they will revert eventually. On the bright side, this can be managed by the BoE to prevent a full-on crash. A question of when *and* if.

Less foreign investment is pretty obvious. If UK property isn't seen as a 'safe' store of wealth, we'll see a flight of capital from the country as money is moved to other countries. The UK is a relatively stable economy so this is less likely to cause a 'shock', it will be quite gradual. This will happen sooner or later, again, when not if.

Increased supply... Looking at all the figures put out by all the companies and government with regards to housing, this is definitely not going to happen before 2020 at the earliest. I would hazard to say it may not happen at all in the next 50 years, there are structural issues leading to chronic supply shortages - the main one being a lack of social house building. Probably not going to happen.

In isolation, these factors lead me to say that it's not going to crash in the near term, barring external factors (oil price spikes, further recessions).

Sometimes when he goes for high risk he fails but everyone is praising Bentaleb for the same thing. I think Chadli's biggest asset is his brain. I can't think of any situations this year where I was wondering why he made a decision, but obviously his execution hasn't been great but that same complaint is said about Lennon. 

He's not as slow as people say. A couple of the runs he made against Swansea were really impressive, however we didn't buy him for his pace. I think going forward we're gonna benefit from having him. Just like Lamela. Having seen the 10-6 result that they both played in, I'm really optimistic. Obviously in a Premier League game they're seldom going to have as many opportunities to impress as they did against a lower league side, but both looked incredibly creative and made the right decisions on the day.

Why hasn't anyone complained about Lamela's pace? From what I've seen it looks like Chadli would beat Lamela in a foot race. But no one's complaining cause Lamela has other traits.

true,ruizscar,cnty-expat,South America,"A range of measures can be employed simultaneously for riots, looting and crowd control:

&gt; Research into weapons that are more effective for riot control continues. Netguns are non-lethal weapons designed to fire a net which entangles the target. Netguns have a long history of being used to capture wildlife, without injury, for research purposes. A netgun is currently in development for non-lethal riot control. Pepper-spray projectile launchers are projectile weapons that launch a fragile ball which breaks upon impact and releases an irritant powder called PAVA (capsaicin II) pepper. The launchers are often slightly modified .68 caliber paintball guns.

&gt; Stink bombs are devices designed to create an extremely unpleasant smell for riot control and area denial purposes. Stink bombs are believed to be less dangerous than other riot control chemicals, since they are effective at low concentrations. Sticky foam weapons are being tested, which cover and immobilize rioters with a gooey foam.

&gt; Low frequency sound cannons are weapons of various types that use sound to injure or incapacitate subjects using a focused beam of sound or infrasound. Active denial systems (ADS) are a non-lethal, directed-energy weapon developed by the U.S. military. The ADS directs electromagnetic radiation, specifically, high-frequency microwave radiation, at a frequency of 95 GHz, which causes the water in the upper epidermis to boil, stimulating a ""burning"" sensation in the nerve endings and generating intense pain. Dazzler lasers are directed-energy weapons that use intense light to cause temporary blindness or disorientation of rioters.

&gt;

&gt;**Philipp Degen** (born 15 February 1983) is a Swiss footballer. Degen is usually a right back but can also play at left back or on the right wing. Degen reached the last 16 in the 2006 World Cup with the Switzerland and was selected again for Euro 2008 but did not play any games.

&gt;He began his professional career at the local Swiss club FC Basel, playing four seasons in the first team before moving to Borussia Dortmund. He spent three years at the German club, his last season being marred by injury. Degen signed for Liverpool on a free transfer on 3 July 2008, his stay at Liverpool was also blemished by many injuries. His Liverpool contract was terminated by mutual consent on 31 August 2011 and he returned to Basel.

The Nightmare Child has to be something the Doctor fears. Otherwise, why bring it up? What does the Doctor fear the most? It has to be a remorseless killer, something that lives to kill with no other purpose than that. 

The Skaro Degradation could be the collective name for the Dalek's forbidden weaponry. Just like the Omega Arsenal housed the Time Lord's forbidden weapons, the Degradation housed the Dalek's. 

The Could-Have-Been King and his army of Meanwhiles and Never-Weres  sounds like a by product of the Time War itself. In the End of Time, the Gallifreyan High Counsel said that time itself was deployed as a weapon and whole battalions Soldiers and Daleks were killed, and resurrected, only to die again. Maybe all of these resurrections destroyed a potential future for the soldier, because days you lived are finite in number, but what might have been is infinite. The potential future had to go somewhere, so it created a meanwhile and/or a never-were. The Could-Have-Been King is probably most powerful of these ""What If's"" and it is only born when great empires are destroyed.  

Then again, the Could-Have-Been King might have already existed as a Gallifreyan myth. When Doctor rattled off the list of things that came out of the chaos of the last Great Time War, the Master only showed fear when the Doctor mentioned the CHB-K.

But this all speculation on my part*. It is something that the fans of the show may never know about because there might be no reason to go back to it.

When you look at his skills he seems a natural fit to play somewhere in the middle up top (CAM/ST/Support Striker) but when you watch him on the pitch he seems to be the most naturally inclined to play on the wing of all our wingers in that, regardless of which side of the pitch he is on he plays the wing as a winger (stays wide, links with the fb, can beat a man on the dribble, hits crosses has a bit of a shot etc).

He really seems like he may be one of our most versatile players and i think that works against him....because there isn't anything in his game that makes you think he is weaker in one position than another but he also seems less likely to excel at one position than another.

I think he can be very valuable to the squad but i think he needs to still learn the league and we need to learn how to leverage his wide skillset.

Both of these have been misrepresented as successful _because_ they were peaceful, whereas in point of fact this is 180 degrees from the truth.

There were plenty of riots and acts of violence in Birmingham and elsewhere which fell into a memory hole because the media didn't want to show them back then, and it was these that generally got specific laws changed.  Likewise, the bombings and assassinations in India were generally far more important in getting the British to leave, it was simply that they preferred to deal with the less threatening and more gentlemanly Gandhi than those who stood in the shadows.

Another recent example:  How many people marched peacefully against the Iraq War to zero effect?  And yet one bomb in Spain had the Spanish forces out in less than a heartbeat.

Please note - I'm _not_ advocating 'bombing for a better world', just showing how in strategic terms, it makes no sense to unreservedly take the option of violence off of the table.  Especially when your opponents are perfectly happy to use violence against you.

* Libel and lander are a grey area, as far as the First Amendment goes. You're free to say it, but defamation laws can punish you. It's not a blanket abridgment across the board, though.
* Clear and present danger is correct. The *Schneck* decision (unanimous) says that the government can prohibit speech that exhibit a clear and present danger (Oliver Wendell Holmes). The common and popular example that Holmes spoke of was falsely yelling ""Fire!"" in a crowded theater.
* Incitement to violence is NOT protected. This has some fairly rigorous tests, as it has to be proven beyond a reasonable shadow of a doubt that the speech in question incited violence.
* Obscenity is NOT protected. The issue is that obscenity is rather vague. As Justice Stewart (I think) said in *Jacobellis*, ""I know it when I see it."" The case was about whether hardcore pornography could be censored and, if it could, *what is hardcore*?

Racial abuse and associated hate speech aren't directly addressed by the courts, exactly, but the argument about their legality is addressed via incitement and obscenity. So a racist tweet that also threatens bodily harm could be argued that it is both obscene and inciting violence, while it wouldn't necessarily pose a C&amp;PD.

Well, a win would be amazing, a draw would be okay, so long as it isn't a stupid error that puts them equal, or a lucky shot by us. A loss by one is okay (grrr…); 2 or greater by shitty and I'm off to hang myself. Conclusion: I want this game to be a well fought match. And to the victor goes the spoils. (I’d really like to make this Man City fan that comes into the Spurs bar cry, so just remember that)

First let’s address without the players out on injury. We play a 4-3-3 Ade with Defoe, Soldado, Bentaleb just a bit back like a diamond. Sigurdsson, Lennon and Holtby as our midfield. Rose, Dawson, and Chiriches as the backline in front of the great Hugo Lloris. 

If (BIG IF) we get everyone back, play a 3-3-4 Defoe, Soldado and Sandro (BEEEEAAAST) up top. Siggy, Paulinho and Holtby in the middle; Vert, Daws, Churches and Kaboom on the back. 

Sheerwooding is a hard science to master, so I wouldn’t guess what he’s going to do. I’m not even quite sure if my choices are acceptable to the gods of soccer, which is why I WATCH the sport, and not play/coach it. I just hope that we make good substitutions, and not just by 12 year olds we pulled from the youth team in a middle school. 

My predicted outcome is 2-1; spurs win by a goddamn miracle. In the long run this isn’t the game that “decides the top 4” but that’s just my philosophical bend. The team finish is the sum of the season, and I wouldn’t want to have it on the list as ‘we should have won this game’ or ‘that game was a tough loss’… 

However, I will set something on fire if we lose by 6 again.

 There is one brand (i forget which offhand but they came from the wholesaler called mr resistor) that does a variety called eterna (I think) which is much more the colour of the old incandescent type of lamp. I used these in led strip lights but I'm pretty sure they come in other varieties.

Led will outlast any other type of lamp so while they are more expensive they are very much a fit and forget option, and the difference in wattage is pretty much the percentage saving you will make. And you can always take them with you when you move out

true,G_A,NoBike,'06 SV650s,"The Drift Ghost is extremely popular in the motovlogging community, the GoPro undeniably records better video at their top of their range but it comes at a rather extreme cost difference, and the Drift series comes with a handful of functions the GoPro would need accessories for.

Wind noise with a camera attached to your lid is horrendous, most people opt to feed an external microphone from the camera to the inside of their lid, the Drift ( and Contour ) series are more appropriate for this.

There's also the profile of the camera, the GoPro is going to be more wind resistant and it's going to make you look a bit more like a Pikmin than a Drift, or better yet in this case, a Contour.

Regarding the Drift camera models, you've the HD170 which they've stopped selling, a good cheap and easily purchased from eBay camera. External microphone port and records in 1080p, I'm also of the opinion the 170 handles low-light situations better than the Ghost.

Step it up and you've the aforementioned Ghost, a respectable step up from it's younger brother the 170 in regards to video quality and features. Uses a standard microphone jack size, comes with a replaceable rear cover to swap between the 3m(?) waterproof cover and rain-proof cover with slots for charging and mic, which is what you'd want for vlogging. Has strong features such as wifi with the remote bundled, the recent history recording and the car DVR mode.

Going one step further, reaching the current top of the series, and you've the very recently released Drift Ghost S. Improves on the Ghost but not by as large of a margin as the Ghost to the HD170. Most notably improved is the low-light sensor, it being the most common complaint of the HD Ghost and a reduced fish-eye lense reducing the FOV from 170 degrees to 160.

This all said, if you want a camera for insurance purposes, find yourself something cheap and cheerful. If you want a camera for vlogging as a hobby, I'd recommend any of the Drift cameras or a cheaper GoPro.

***Spoilers for whole series below***

1. Handles is the one transporting him. He yells at handles for landing him on the Dalek ship with a  piece of broken Dalek in his hand. The Doctor didnt specify the ship and didnt look around until he took off his hood. Cybermen are constantly changing and upgrading there ships and technology. Its understandable that the Tardis or the Doctor didnt recognize the ship.

2. The Doctor is really good at teleports (Season 1 Episode 11 ""Boom Town"" Below) Ill believe he has or can easily make a teleport with the most advanced tech in the universe at his fingertips. And why would he land that greatest tech in the universe on an unknown ship and risk having it stolen. It's happened plenty of times before. (*Edit to this one: He actually does land the Tardis on the Cyberman's ship, he is shown being fired at while running into the open Tardis*):
&gt; **(Margaret vanishes.)** 
&gt; **JACK:** She's got a teleport! That's cheating! Now we're never going to get her. 
&gt; **ROSE**: Oh, the Doctor's very good at teleports. 
&gt; (The Doctor holds up his sonic screwdriver and Margaret reappears, running towards them. Vanish, reappear. Vanish, reappear.) 
&gt; **DOCTOR:** I could do this all day. 

3. The Day of the Doctor had Tardis proof areas shown in it made by humans. Now all of a sudden a space faring super advance alien civilization that runs security for the whole universe cant lock a planet down? Please. It's totally plausible. Tardis cant fly to Gallifrey either, time locked. The technology totally exists to stop a Tardis. And he is able to use the Tardis key as a beacon to get his Tardis from unreachable places as early as Season 1 Episode 8 ""Fathers Day"". The Keys is very intimately linked to the Tardis.

4. Meh, Ill give him the Angels. I think they could have gotten there, but them not chasing him down bothered me a bit.

5. The Tardis was on a Very future, war torn version of Trenzelore. Understandable that it wasnt able to identify where it had landed. And ""the next question SHOULD HAVE BEEN What planet"" Just because that is what this guy thinks should have been the next question does not make it so. 

6. The guy answers his own question in this one. He refutes the correct answer by saying ""They have Time travel, they should know they can't change their own past"". But one, thats just not true, the past is changed all the time in the show. And two, they are an evil cult hell bent on trying anything to destroy the Doctor, the ""dont change your past"" rules prolly didnt bother them much, they still wanted to give it a shot.

7. His plan was to go in there with no plan. Usually works best for him anyway: ""**CLARA**: Doctor, what are you going to do? 
**DOCTOR**: Oh, I don't know. Talk very fast, hope something good happens, take the credit. That's generally how it works. ""

8. That wasnt the Doctor in the Impossible Astronaut. That was the Teselecta, a super advanced Time Traveling, shape-shifting ship driven by a team of engineers. It can do a little light show for the audience. And he was bluffing and lying to the Cyber control, like he does in nearly every episode.

9. Why doesnt he stick around? What? Yea, he had just exploded and ran to his Tardis to die and regenerate in a safe place. This guy somehow knows how the doctor acts in scenes not yet filmed because apparently the Doctor ""Sails of, Oblivious to Gallifrey""... He knows Gallifrey is there, he had just been given a whole new regeneration cycle from them. Let him regenerate and get the kinks worked out before he tries to bring back an entire murderous civilization. And it's pretty hard to ""sail off"" while you're ""Probably crashing"", as the Doctor says they are.

10. The Doctor doesnt kill? Some cultures in the universe refer to ~~him as The Warrior instead of the Doctor~~ their Warriors as Doctors. His first on screen action in NuWho is to commit an act of terrorism in a major city. He blew up en entire cyber fleet in A Good Man Goes To War.  Drops the Sycorax Leader off the side of a spaceship. The Impossible Astronaut / Day of the Moon has him hypnotize the entire planet into commiting genocide once again against the Silence. Has Soloman's ship targeted by missiles and blown up in Dinosaurs on a Spaceship. And 10 was the only one that said he didnt like guns. But even he picks one up when it has to do the the Time Lords coming back. I think the Doctor can blast a few of his greatest foes to stop another time war.
Even so, besides the Daleks, who does the Doctor kill in this episode? Mainframe kills the 2 Sontarans, and he tricks the CyberWood into killing itself.

I still think a Sandro / Dembele / Paulinho 4-3-3 could work some day with Eriksen given lots of freedom coming in from the left. It would allow both Mousa and Paulinho to bomb forward without sacrificing a lot of creativity. 

I hope it's another sign of Sherwood's adaptability. I wouldn't mind playing a 4-4-2 with Dembele and Paulinho at home against, say, Crystal Palace, but in bigger matches we could revert to something a bit more solid.

I think I might get off okay when the judge says ""what are his previous convictions?"" as a response.

I can understand that I might only give one password and that there might be another one, but they will never, ever know with any kind of certainty if there is a srecond hidden section if only one password is given. They could interrogate an innocent person into the ground and still not get what they want, throw him in jail etc. but they still won't get what they want.

&gt; When did it become so common to disparage anyone who hasn’t made it big, hasn’t gotten rich, as a “loser”? Well, that’s actually a question we can answer, using Google Ngrams, which track the frequency with which words or phrases are used in books. Sure enough, the term “losers” has become much more common since the 1960s. *And I think this word usage reflects something real — a growing contempt for the little people.*

http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/13/youre-all-losers

&gt;  It’s one thing to say, “Those people can’t change, so let’s not waste our time.” It’s another to say, “Those people can’t change, so let’s lock them away.” Or eradicate them: *Only four years ago, then-Lt. Gov. of South Carolina Andre Bauer told a town hall meeting that poor people, like “stray animals,” should not be fed, “because they breed.”*

http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2014/01/social_darwinism_and_class_essentialism_the_rich_think_they_are_superior.single.html

&gt; A prerequisite to empathy is simply paying attention to the person in pain. In 2008, social psychologists studied pairs of strangers telling one another about difficulties they had been through, like a divorce or death of a loved one. The researchers found that the differential expressed itself in the playing down of suffering. *The more powerful were less compassionate toward the hardships described by the less powerful.*

*Here's a bit from linked Wikipedia article about* [***Raymond Kelly***](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond%20Kelly) : 

---

&gt;**Raymond Walter ""Ray"" Kelly** (born September 4, 1941) was the longest serving Commissioner of the New York City Police Department (NYPD) in its history and the first person to hold the post for two non-consecutive tenures. A lifelong New Yorker, Kelly had spent 47 years in the NYPD according to its website, serving in 25 different commands and as Police Commissioner from 1992 to 1994 and 2002 to 2013. Kelly was the first person to rise from Police Cadet to Police Commissioner, holding all of the department's ranks, except for Three-Star Bureau Chief, Chief of Department, and Deputy Commissioner, having been promoted directly from Two-Star Chief to First Deputy Commissioner in 1990. After his handling of the World Trade Center bombing in 1993, he was mentioned for the first time as a possible candidate for FBI Director. After Kelly turned down the position, Louis Freeh was appointed.

As I said above, if you really look at the things that are keeping the market the way it is, they aren't 5 minute things that will suddenly come to an end. Britain is a popular place to live and for the foreseeable future our population will be in growth. One recent report suggested the population of the UK would exceed that of Germany by 2030 at the current rate. Similarly, as an island nation we will always be subject to extrinsic factors that limit the land we can build on. It is also largely cultural - in the UK owning property is pretty much *the single* most desirable thing you can possess. It doesn't matter how nice your Austin Martin DB9 is, or how shiney your Rolex watch looks... if you don't own property you are a second class citizen. Legally, you have less protection and fewer rights than your landlord. It's just part of an outdated system from a different age when landowners were wealthy aristocrats and industrialists and tenants were their illiterate indentured servants. I've no doubt it will change in the next decade or so but the point is people *want* property here in a way that say in Germany they don't... which gives property added value.

Don't get me wrong, I'd actually quite like to see the housing market take a small hit, especially BTL which I think is run in such a morally abberant way... but I just don't see it happening. Homeowners make up the people in society who matter - older voters and the people they vote for.  They are ultimately going to choose policies that support them.

Dole figures still resolutely above national average

Commenting on the release of December's unemployment figures George Galloway said: ""There is no cause for congratulation in these figures. More than 5000 people are still unemployed in my constituency, the unemployment rate is still resolutely above the national average - at 10.9%, still the seventh-highest in the country. There may be some comfort to the 478 who have found jobs, against the same month last year, but let's look at this more closely. Even if you have got a job your pay increase, if you have had one in the last five years, is less than half of inflation. George Osborne has been mouthing platitudes about perhaps raising the minimum wage, no doubt by pennies, but there shouldn't even be one. We need to pay people a living wage, not a subsistence one, and even the CBI agree that higher pay levels would produce better work and productivity. Bradford is an unemployment blackspot and all of the chancellor's verbal whitewash cannot cover that up. We need action and resources, particularly to help find young people meaningful and satisfying employment.""

I think you are weighing their attributes differently than Mourinho is. He is clearly putting much more weight on Oscar's work ethic and aptitude defensively (his ability to win back balls) than you are. Oscar is simply better suited than Mata to the style of counter-attacking that Mourinho is implementing at the club.

Oscar's vision is also still improving. He's only been our starting CAM for half a season; he is also trading spots occasionally with Neymar for their national team, and plenty of pundits (along with myself) think that Brazil is better with Neymar on the wing and with Oscar in the middle specifically die to his abilities being better tailored to that role.

Yeah, your quick rules of thumb are spot on; I was just trying to clarify for the People At Home who might not know where it gets stickier. 

&gt; I think you would agree that very rarely has someone racially abusing another person been charged with a crime in the US.

Absolutely. Labeling hate speech in the same category as the other prohibitions is a waaaaaay sticky area that the courts have repeatedly stayed far away from in the past. The problem with hate speech, as opposed to the other things, is that it's akin to regulating how people are allowed to think and feel. They might be utter asswipes, but they do have the right to be an asswipe.

I agree 100%--no judge would *ever* find a racist tweet an example of obscene speech; like Justice Stewart said ""I know it when I see it"" and something like that, while offensive, isn't an example of obscenity, on par with CP or snuff. They very intentionally left it vague, because having bright line rules in 1st Amendment cases is a absolute recipe for disaster, but this is pretty commonsensical. It's not to say that someone couldn't argue otherwise, but no judge would find in favor of that argument.

And yeah, incitement is *very* hard to prove. To the extent that, when Rep. Gabby Giffords was shot, Sarah Palin's website that had a picture of Giffords with a target on her couldn't be proved to be incitement. That's not to say that threats, even on twitter, *can't* incite violence, but it's *really* hard to prove and most prosecutions would hinge on assault (or even reasonable danger) rather than challenging the 1st.

At the very most, in the situation described in the original comment (going up to a person and racially abusing them), the words would be found to be ""fighting words"" and intentionally provocative. And assuming the wronged party reacted like most people would (throwing a punch), the words would probably be used as a mitigating factor, basically saying that the person punching had every right :P",0,1390415728,null,0,false,0,cew3xb9,t3_1vstiu,t1_cew3xb9,t1_cew2e51,null,1432057103,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Make Moyes think he's going to be a hero and save his season, then leave him empty handed at the deadline.

&gt;If the government wants to take a site off the Internet they sure-as-shit don't need this crappy optional ISP-filter to do it.

You're right. There are other ways of doing it too, and they do use those methods. For instance, the UK has super injunctions. Super injunctions are similar to the US' national security letters, ie it gags you, except they are specifically meant for media outlets. 

That power has already [been used in disreputable ways.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_C%C3%B4te_d%27Ivoire_toxic_waste_dump)

&gt;The gas caused by the release of these chemicals is blamed by the UN and the government of Côte d'Ivoire for the deaths of 17 and the injury of over 30,000 Ivorians, with injuries that ranged from mild headaches to severe burns of skin and lungs. Almost 100,000 Ivorians sought medical attention for the effects of these chemicals.[1]

[it continues]

&gt;On 11 September 2009, Trafigura, via lawyers Carter-Ruck, obtained a secret ""super-injunction""[39] against The Guardian, banning that newspaper from publishing the contents of the Minton report. Trafigura also threatened a number of other media organizations with legal action if they published the report's contents, including the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation[37] and The Chemical Engineer magazine.[6] 

[it continues]

&gt;Faced with a libel case which under British law could drag on for years and cost millions of pounds on 10 December 2009, the BBC removed the original story entitled ""Dirty Tricks and Toxic Waste in the Ivory Coast"", along with accompanying video, from its website. The story featured interviews with victims in Côte d'Ivoire, including relatives of two children who, it claimed, died from the effects of the waste. The story also claimed that Trafigura brought ""ruin"" on the country in order to make a ""massive profit"".[47] The stories remain available on WikiLeaks. On 15 December 2009, the broadcaster agreed to apologise to Trafigura for the ""Dirty Tricks"" report, pay £25,000 to charity, and withdraw any allegation that Trafigura's toxic waste dumped in Africa had caused deaths.

That is one example. There was a recent report recently of a department that cuts off ad revenue to websites as a means of shutting them down.

true,YourLizardOverlord,eng-sussex,Scotland --&gt; West Sussex,"&gt;2 - Protect our borders

&gt;we fully regain control of our borders and control migration.

I want open borders and free movement.

&gt;3 - Rebuild Prosperity and Keeping the Lights On

&gt;Outside the EU we will save £53m a day and we can give British workers the first crack at the 800,000 jobs we currently advertise to EU workers.

Free borders and lump of labour fallacy. 

&gt;Local councils are to enroll unemployed welfare claimants onto community schemes or retraining workfare programmes.

I'm implacably against workfare in all its forms. 

&gt;Scrap all green taxes, wind turbine subsidies and adopt nuclear power to free us from dependence on fossil fuels and foreign oil and gas.

Renewables are the future. The current tax regime has many faults, but it's better that just scrapping ""all the green crap"". Specifically I don't want this to be left to the market.

&gt;4 - Safeguards Against Crime

&gt;No cuts to front line policing

Do we need to spend as much on policing given that crime rates are dramatically falling?

&gt;Make sentences mean what they say – life must mean life.

It already does for some cases. We already have quite severe sentences compared to the rest of the EU. Do they really need to be longer?

&gt;No votes for prisoners.

I'm in favour of votes for prisoners.

&gt;Remove the UK from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights.

I'm in favour of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights. The only time the government or tabloids complain about this is when they want to strip rights from some obnoxious or unpopular group or person. Either everyone has rights or in practice nobody has.

&gt;5 - Care And Support For All 

&gt;Social Housing to be prioritised for people whose parents and grandparents were born locally.

We should build millions of units of social housing so we don't need to worry about who gets it.

&gt;Allow the creation of new grammar schools.

It's not good to split people up at age 11. And the non grammar schools are in danger of becoming educational dustbins. 

Previous UKIP manifestos also advocated increasing our defence budget. I'm in favour of cutting our defence budget. 

It doesn't look as if UKIP is the party for me.

On closer examination this figure relates only two ‘riot’ locations in London; 55 private homes in Croydon and 45 in Tottenham.  Of these 100 properties, 26 lay above the Carpetright shop in Tottenham and the majority (if not all) in Croydon were damaged by a single fire set in the Reeves Furniture Store to which they were adjacent.

* Rebooted the Universe, got willed back into existence by Amy Pond. 

* Made the Universe forget about him. Got to wander around without incident for a while. 

* Crossed his own timestream in the biggest way possible by entering it himself and came out of it unscathed. He did not have a moment of insanity because of it.

and

&gt;A 68-year-old man, Richard Mannington Bowes, died on 11 August after he was attacked while attempting to stamp out a litter-bin fire in Ealing on the evening of 8 August. The attack on Bowes was witnessed by several police officers, but due to the number of rioters they were unable to come to his aid until riot squad officers pushed back the rioters while being attacked to reach Bowes. A line of officers then held back the rioters as paramedics arrived. Bowes's wallet and phone had been stolen, and police faced difficulty in identifying him.

2. City's tactics sort of look like ours, doesn't it?  A 4-4-2 that's really a fluid 4-3-3 with two central midfielders bossing everyone around.  I think the way we counter this and try to neutralize Toure and Fernadinho is by keeping the ball away from them.  A 4-2-3-1 / 4-5-1 where we're focusing our attacks down the flanks seems to make sense to me.

3. I think Sherwood ditches the 4-4-2.  If he recognized the need for 5 midfielders versus Swansea, he'll recognize we need to attack the flanks versus City.  I think his tactics against Arsenal was a completely different scenario.  The cup competitions weren't high on the radar in comparison to rescuing our league season.  That might have just been a ballsy roll of the dice.

4. 2-2.  I think this game sets the tone for our season.  After everything that happened before Tim took over, a positive result can show the players that a simple change in tactics and philosophy was all they needed to live up to their potential.

The thing you're looking for here is the ""[colour temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_temperature)"". Basically, on any decent LED (and fluorescent) lamp you'll find a Kelvin^1 number (between 2700K and 6500K usually for domestic lighting) which tells you how ""warm"" or ""cool"" the light is. Perhaps slightly confusingly, a higher colour temperature means a cooler (more blueish) light.

If you're going for a comfortably warm feeling, then aim for something below 3500K and you should be fine.

You can say what you want about Andre but something a lot of players commented on (from youth up) is that he held everyone to the exact same standard and was always open and honest. His big thing has always been being ""Porto school""; every single person at the club adopting the same mentality and pushing selflessly in the same direction. 

To me this is simultaneously a strength and a massive weakness. It probably works in a situation like Porto but when you have a club buying big players from vastly different backgrounds or when there's simply a different culture at the club it can alienate people. 

Adebayor isn't a selfish guy (certainly not on the pitch), but I don't think it would be too big of a stretch to say he might be a bit lazy and individualistic--much like Benny. 

I think in spite of what he's claimed, AVB still hasn't learned that some players you just have to deal with differently to get the best out of them. He has too much pride in his belief that every single person involved at the club should be dealt with exactly the same. It's as if he'd rather suffer on the pitch than come off as a hypocrite or inconsistent. 

Being a politician is sort of part of management, from what I can tell. Adebayor is a player who needs to have his ass kissed a bit, frankly. Sherwood has been more than willing to do that and it's paid dividends. 

I think AVB is a very good man, but being a bit of a smarmy gladhand at times might make him a better manager.

Just about every bell-weather of British industry is pointing towards economic stability and recovery over the 2008 peak in the near future. That is not to say there aren't still significant structural problems that still need to be addressed, not least the fact individual productivity has declined as well as demographic issues relating to an aging population... but on the whole things look about as good as they have done for nearly 6 years.

Short of some natural disaster I just can't see what would happen in the next 12-24 months to precipitate another crash. If anything the UK is becoming one of relatively few safe havens from the crisis as it seems that as conditions worsen in the Eurozone or the US we become a safer bet.

true,btharveyku08,null,null,"Re: the Soton game, there are admittedly lurking variables in the additional changes made around the time when Oscar came onto the field. But in the least, if you look at the result and the fact that we haven't seen Mata since then, I think we can infer Mourinho's frame of mind with respect to the Oscar/Mata question.

And re: the elusive magic touch, that is where I look to Oscar's age and room for more growth. He is much more of an eager guinea pig for Mourinho to mold, I think. I love Mata as much as every other Blue, but I get the feeling that he's at a stage in his career where he's established his on-field product, the the rest of his growth coming from fine-tuning with the tendencies of the squad around him. He'll continue to hone his trade, but he just was never asked to be the sort of player that Mourinho wants. Because of that, i think Oscar can eventually be that while Mata either can't or doesn't think he should have to.

We may definitely have some issues with consistency from Oscar for a while. But his ceiling is that of a #10 perfectly tailored to the style Mourinho wants to implement at Chelsea.

Looking at the bigger picture, we've seen several instances where Mourinho seems serious about restructuring Chelsea in terms of the players and where they come from (wanting more of an Academy presence and becoming more self-sufficient). Just touching on that, Mata deserves wages MUCH higher than he's currently getting, and we'd have to look at restructuring his contract starting probably within the next year to compensate for that, to avoid (more) overtures from other clubs. Add in that we have an abundance of AM talent in the pipeline, and the only question mark I still have is why we don't wait until the summer to sell Mata, so we're not sacrificing quality depth mid-season (especially AFTER selling KDB). I can only assume that Emenalo thinks we can squeeze significantly more money out of a desperate ManU hierarchy now than later.",0,1390418593,null,0,false,0,cew5bwu,t3_1vv90p,t1_cew5bwu,t1_cew4j5c,null,1432057742,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

You clearly don't know much about football if you think that third place is inevitable and that the system isn't working. Maybe you just started watching football lately?

Firstly, we are 2 points off first place. That is ONE game.

Secondly, compared to this time last year (when we were playing Mata in every game, by the way):

* After **24** games, on the 31st of January, 2013: 45 points.
* After **22** games, on the 22nd of January, 2014: 49 points.

As for our contenders: City have to play away at Liverpool, Arsenal, United, Spurs and Everton. Arsenal have to play away to us, Everton and Liverpool.

Our performances against the top teams? We have beaten **all** of our rivals at home and we have not lost to any of them away.

Our defensive strength since we lost to Sunderland? To quote one post:

&gt;In the last 7 games Chelsea's opponents have only managed an average of 2.2 shots on target per game and only scored 2 goals in total. This includes matches against Arsenal, United and Liverpool.

Our current form is **D W W W W W**. Compare that to the shocking league performances that we've had over the past few years.

Post Thatcher they have nowhere near that amount of clout and generally the country works better for that. Think miners, factory workers,  transport industry etc. Look how many British Leyland strikes there were. Now the unions still can support the workers but not bring the country to its knees, as was the case with some of the earlier strikes. Also privatisation of many public sector firms such as BT and British Gas, which frees up huge amounts of money that could, in theory, go towards better causes such as the NHS. Obviously Thatcher also made some massive calls that really hurt, for example, the mining communities, but public sector mines were expensive and the NUM and Scargill were leaning heavily towards communism in the middle of the Cold War, potentially undermining the entire system of government. Maybe things could have been handled better, but with inflation growing definitely something had to be done and it would have been a difficult call for any Prime Minister.

So to these people I ask.. What's your excuse now? Mata - our player of the year 2 season in a row, and in the third season we end up selling him?? Never have I seen such insolence in football. Even though I will always love Jose, I won't ever forgive him for this. He has systematically destroyed Mata's career just like Benitez tried to destroy Terry's last season. Mata is OUR player. He loves this club and the fans and always gave 100% for the club and to sell him to one of our biggest rivals is like saying we don't really give a shit what happens to him as long as we get the money and his wages off our books.

We as fans always seem to make up some stupid excuse to let the board off the hook when we sell our top prospects/players. Happened with Sturridge, happened with KDB and now I'm sure everyone will forget about Mata if we end up winning the title or if we end up signing Shaw or another player. But it won't change the fact that this is a BAD deal for us. I will also mention a point I made long ago about players being treated as commodities. If we are a family, the Chelsea family, is this how you treat your players?

Also, the fact that Man UTD have stood firm on Rooney and we haven't on Mata says it all about our board's backbone. I also now believe that ridiculous rumour of us making and offer of 20 odd million plus Mata in the summer was true.

Plus, my parents own their house outright so when they die I'll get that. Their home is a three bedroom house built in the 1950s within a short commuter distance of Edinburgh and the value of their house is below the IHT threshold. 

Even at the moment I could rent their house out if I was back in work, pay for my social housing rent from that income and have several hundred a month to invest in a pension (that's if I don't just use it as disposable income) then sell off the house when I come to retire and invest the money from the sale of the house in a pension fund.

My parents are in their mid-sixties, so they're realistically going to be dead within twenty years. I can't afford a pension now because I'm on benefits and I might not be able to afford to invest in a pension beyond the mandatory workplace scheme everyone will soon have to be enrolled in when I return to work, but if I manage the inheritance properly then I should have an acceptable pension income when I come to retire.

If I'm still on benefits for whatever reason when my parents die then I can always sell the house straight away and invest the proceeds in a pension fund as the DWP don't treat that as disposing of assets in order to still be eligible for benefits.",0,1390420325,null,0,false,0,cew66kv,t3_1vubmc,t1_cew66kv,t1_cevwfgx,null,1432058175,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

""Yes, but the implication was the Doctor could still regenerate.

Also, the Doctor seems to think regeneration might be an option in ""Let's Kill Hitler."" He's told ""Regeneration disabled"" which again, implies it would have been an option otherwise. River Song disabled his ability to regenerate, otherwise the response would be, ""No regenerations remaining.""


In the Impossible Astronaut we are given a future Doctor and even though it wasn't actually him he could have still found a way to exceed the regeneration limit in the hundred or so year time gap. And the next bit was a bluff. The Cyber-planner didn't have full control of the Doctor's mind. The Doctor showed him about regeneration but even the Doctor was still keeping his secret and had control to not let the cyber-planner know. And as for Let's Kill Hitler, the Doctor was poisoned and incapable of thinking straight. The TARDIS might have even had the memory of the War Doctor erased.

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;The **Cars of the Stars Motor Museum** was in the English town of Keswick, Cumbria, and owned a collection of celebrity television and film vehicles. On 8 May 2011, the attraction closed, with a message on the museum website stating ""...check the website for details of the relocation of the vehicles to a new location shortly..."" Briefly afterwards it became known that nearly all of the vehicles had been sold to the American collector Michael Dezer. He relocated the collection to America, where he used it to establish a permanent Cars of the Stars exhibition at his Auto Museum in Miami.

&gt; Whether an employee is protected by UK employment law will always depend on the individual circumstances of their employment. It is, however, possible to identify the following checklist of factors which will influence whether UK law applies:

&gt;    The location of the employing company;
&gt;    Where management, HR functions, training and administration relating to the employee's work take place;
&gt;    Where pay, pensions, tax and National Insurance contributions are payable;
&gt;    The currency in which employees are paid;
&gt;    Whether the employer pays commuting or other related costs;
&gt;    The amount of time an employee spends in the UK to work, live or to undergo training;
&gt;    Whether legal references in the contract are consistent with the legal system said to be applicable; and
&gt;    Whether there is a clause in the contract dealing with where the parties anticipate legal claims should be raised;

true,SushiSnuglet,eng-Bristol,Bristol,"I just want to take issue with how you described people who work in early years settings (pre-schools, nurseries etc). My Mum has worked in early years education for over 20 years now and the requirements for the job have really toughened up. Nowadays, you must provide an education for the toddlers instead of just tipping a box of toys out. Yes it's learning through play - which is much better for young kids than classroom learning - but you still have to do lesson plans and make sure you're covering all the key areas of the early years curriculum. For years, my Mum worked at a place that gave her no paid hours to do this planning, so she bought it all home and our dining table was covered in paper just so someone else's kid got to do XYZ. You are ofsted inspected just like a school. Basically, you are a teacher but you get none of the benefits. Whatever parents pay to a nursery will go to the people who own it, and the staff will make minimum wage. They get no sick pay, no pension etc. The job is also very physically demanding, as you're running around after kids all day, and you must also deal with kids who've been abused, kids with learning disabilities (often with parents who refuse to accept their kid has a learning disability), and kids who have lazy parents who think being in nappies at age 3 is fine. And the bum wiping, so much bum wiping. Yes, there are 18 year olds who think ""I love kids, I'll do this job and sit with them all day"" and get a big fucking shock at how tough it is, but there are also a lot of very diligent workers, just like there are good teachers. I'm sure you wouldn't talk about your kid's primary school teacher in the way you did in your post, so please don't generalise and degrade a bunch of people just because they work with pre-school kids, not school age kids.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"&gt; Because they are new builds, there will likely be some expensive service charges in addition to paying for the % you're renting.

They are almost always in apartment buildings if you look in cities - which means you tend to pay your mortgage (typically of around £500) per month, a rent (usually of about £150-200 a month) to the other share and then a fee to the ""building management company"" which covers everything from maintenance/light-bulbs in the public spaces/cleaners and sometimes water is also included in this part. It can actually add up to near or over £1000 a month in the South East.

It isn't necessarily a terrible idea if you know you can pay it down and you do your research. It is usually best to pick somewhere which is a bit of an ugly duckling now, but in 10 years when you want to sell is the ""place to be"". Obvious choices are things like up and coming marina developments or posh shopping districts in cities. Anything near a major train-station also tends to have value added over time.

Even more so than other types of housing you need to be very clear what the terms and conditions are. Are you a freeholder or commonholder (which is generally safe) or are you a leaseholder (effectively a tenant of the land, but an owner of the property on it)... if so what is the length of the lease? What are your responsibilities and commitments in terms of the building? - Will all the occupants get stung if the building needs £150,000 of exterior works to remain habitable or is it covered by the freeholder. What are the conditions of sale on the property - can the other share or the freeholder block a sale. This might very well be the case if the development is an ""Over 50s only"" arrangement for example. How is the building management run - is it a committee of residents or a private company in which you get no say? etc.",0,1390424022,null,0,false,0,cew80gv,t3_1vubmc,t1_cew80gv,t1_cevyszu,null,1435522367,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Furthermore, could you explain how in the hell Jose ""systematically destroyed Mata's career""? He doesn't play to the new standard, he doesn't see playing time over the players that do. That's fair. He doesn't see playing time he wants, he's allowed to leave to go elsewhere to receive playing time. That would also be fair.

true,canyoufeelme,null,null,"Reddit consists mainly of 20-something year old's with a few 30 year old's and a couple of 40 year olds as well as a few older folk here and there. 

20 somethings usually have a liberal slant to their perspective as is the nature of the ""liberal"" and ""conservative"" ideologies; everyone is liberal when they're younger, growing more ""conservative"" as they age in order to ""conserve"" their *former* liberal principles that have now become ""conservative"" over time and replaced with new ""liberal"" principles because things change with time and all that.

It's not surprising people on Reddit often don't take too kindly to parties like UKIP or ""right wing"" content in general, especially my generation who tend to bawk at any kind of minority bullying like racism or homophobia, and because the world is much more ""globally connected"" now thanks to the internet and other things my generation doesn't take too kindly to xenophobia and nationalism in general is seen as a rather out dated and problematic principle in our new global world where people are thinking much more about us as a global people as apposed to a tribe and the invisible borders that separate us continue to melt away. 

How people who are ""conservative"" or ""right wing"" can't see this is beyond me. I mean it's like me going onto a KKK forum and complaining there isn't any ""pro-black"" content. Or going on an LGBT forum and complaining it's ""biased"" because nobody is posting any ""anti-gay"" content. If you want to be around people who share your views, go to a forum that caters to them, or at *least* post some content that is more applicable to you. 

People always complain about the ""anti-UKIP circle jerk"" or the ""hive mind"" or the fact there is no ""pro-UKIP"" content without actually doing anything. Nobody is stopping anybody from posting ""pro-UKIP"" content, I don't get why they don't do this instead of just complaining about all the anti-UKIP content.

They stuck with the team and are now many years later they are the modern iconic figures in this club. Even Paulo Ferreira would be considered more of a legend. Why? because he put club before player (something a lot of Chelsea fans even fail to do) and despite not getting much playing time, he offered his full services to Chelsea whenever they needed it and stayed loyal.

Mata was great, and we SHOULD respect him for what he's helped us achieve.

Sturridge, Suarez and Sterling/Salah are more than enough. Based on how Brendan has operated thus far, I'd expect Sterling to keep his spot until Salah proves it should be his.

Also, if the Mata move facilitates Rooney to Real Madrid which is expected. Then they'll no longer be after Suarez, that would benefit us in the long run.

Quite. That's my neck of the woods and I've never seen a homeless person sleeping rough in all of SW London from Chelsea all the way down to Kingston. Maybe they just get moved on by the police due to complaints from the locals. That wouldn't surprise me.

Apart from the Romanians in Park Lane/Marble Arch I don't recall seeing many at all. I wonder where they all are because a comment above you states that the number of rough sleepers has actually increased significantly in London.

Luckily, the company I work for actively encourages us to spend a week or so per year doing charity work in the field, and I'm particularly interested in helping out feeding homeless ex-servicemen/women.

Imagine if Jim Tressel (a former coach who had a lot of success) returned to OSU to coach football. Among his players is a top-ranked quarterback named John who has been named OSU's player of the year for two years running.

Tressel, however, wants to change things up. He asks John to play running back while another player takes over at QB. John has a hard time adjusting to his new position, and does not get as much time as he wants and as the fans want.

John grows unhappy even as the team does well with the new quarterback. He is trying hard and ultimately seeing little success. He gets an offer from Penn State (not the biggest rival, but still a rival) to play. He will get more scholarship money and more playing time there--and after all, no matter how much he loves his teammates at Ohio State, all he wants to do is play football.

Because thats going to get us fucked just the same. I'm truly just boggled because everytime Rodgers has fielded a formation with only 2 CMs they have been our worst performances in his reign. We've played shit against Villa twice in the last 2 years with just 2 CMs. Oldham made us look like a League 1 side last year. 

Honestly, I don't remember every specific match he fielded this formation, but when he has it has failed. Every time but once (my ability to concede that it worked ever should be proof I'm not incapable of seeing nuance) when I think it was:

               Suarez            Sturridge

That was only one time. Every other time we've gotten torn to shreds. And I just don't see why so many people think we need so many straight attackers in a side. Sturridge and Suarez create enough just between each other. One more plus Hendo's creativity and box to box ability, not to mention Gerrard slicing open a defense, should be enough.

I'm really fed up of hearing this. If Thatcher hadn't done it the free market would have.

If anything, history will be grateful Thatcher closed down the mines as forcefully as she did, whatever her reasons for it. Closing them sooner rather than later is always better from a certain (longsighted) standpoint. Hey, that might even be why Labour - champions of the North and the poor class - didn't reopen them.

Honestly, people were saying this in the pre-match thread before Villa. Guess what, Rodgers listened, and we saw what happened. 

I don't disagree with you that two holding CMs can work for a side. Just look at Man City, Chelsea, United, and Tottenham for quite solid sides that frequently operate with only two CMs, both who do variations on the role. One more combative and one more creative.

Perhaps this would be possible, even for us with our present CMs, if we had fullback/wingbacks who were more capable in possession and defense. I think Enrique and Johnson are both great on their day but also can really mess things up. 

Anyways, I think this season our best display was against Tottenham. Say what you will about our other big wins or even our loss against City that was quite a great performance. In that we operated a 4-3-3 basically speaking.

We had Lucas holding, Allen and Henderson pressing, and then Suarez, Sterling and Coutinho up top unlocking their defense. 

Right now I think, unless we sign a pure DM, the best stopgap is similar with Allen holding, Hendo pressing and Gerrard basically being Gerrard. 

It's imperfect and I do think Gerrard has become a weak link, but his passing and general tenacity can often times can in handy. 

Up front we simply don't need two wingers because both Sterling (or Salah if he comes in the side) and Sturridge are quick enough to stretch the back line. Sturridge and Suarez also find space magnificently together, and I think offer more than a lot both creatively and around the goal.


In every match where our front 4 have been pure attackers (versus our usually fielded front 3 of attackers), we've failed to control possession and as such looked as shellshocked in the final 3rd and as we have in defense.

I also don't believe Hendo offers nearly half of what he does when he's expected to be a holding midfielder. With him and Gerrard against Villa, he really didn't even do that, as he was often way up near the box. We saw with his flick to Sturridge that he can create some joy in that. But at the same time his being forward meant Gerrard was the last line of defense before our actual defense. Even if it was Allen, I don't see it being enough. I think we thrive on the interconnectivity of a midfield triangle, however arranged, and a forward 3 that is both creative, fast, and clinical around the net.

For the first 2 months Mata did not even feature in the lineup, even though he was fit and ready to go - Mata said this himself. After first 2 months, Jose claims Oscar is his ACM and nobody else. Jose had also claimed he will play Mata out on the wing in his FIRST Press Conference - so that proves that Jose had absoultely no intention of playing Mata in the middle whatsoever. So this ""he does not fit in out system"" you speak of is utter nonsense. Jose played Hazard in every game for 2 months even though he was crap in attack and we were struggling for goals.

And I'm sorry, but if you say a player doesn't fit in a system after just 4 MONTHS into a season you're deluded. We're talking about human beings here, not robotic hands on a production line. Some need more time than others to adjust. Mata was trying his level best. Jose favoured Oscar because the system he wanted to play suited Oscar's strengths better than Mata's. Given time, Mata would have adjusted. The only thing clear to me at the moment is that Jose and the club are ready to give up on players in a matter of few months.

We saw this same kind of ""lets give up on him"" attitude under AVB with Lamps. You could say the same thing about Lamps in that system, that he ""does not fit in that system"", so would you have sold Lamps solely on that excuse? That too to Man UTD? Since you know, its ""common sense"" that Lamps at that point wasn't crucial to our team......

This Jose Mourinho blind faith needs to be abolished. I'm not saying Jose Mourinho is bad for this club. The progress he is making with this squad is amazing. I just don't like that his favourites are safe no matter what, whilst everyone else has to fight for a place. Its called bias, and its not something to be proud of.

&gt;And the fact that United have stood firm on Rooney shows that he is crucial to their team. Mata, at this point, is not to us. Nothing to do with backbone, just common sense.

So sell him to our biggest rival? Especially when we can just as easily sell him abroad? I'm sorry but there is no viable excuse for selling Mata to Man UTD. Absolutely none.

It could be changed a little but it looks like a good attacking team, where we won't get completely bossed in the midfield cause that SSS line could drop back a little. 

Assuming Salah can defend aswell as Sterling, then they could track back and help Johnson/Enrique, plus they're both pacey so they could get up the field quickly with Studge for counter attacks. 

Also when we're playing the better teams where we get bossed in midfield, we could play a team like this

&gt;He's not a traditional #10

Well I guess you're right here, but I don't see how it's a bad thing.  He's a no.10 that can tackle and press relentlessly.  Oscar has the second most tackles* on the team to Ramires (83), and tied with Azpi with 68.  Your assertion that he can't slow the game down is odd because that is not really something one single player is capable of, it's a team thing.

*All statistics supplied henceforth will only be including the Premier and Champions league EDIT: also from fourfourtwo

&gt;He's too generous on the ball

Oscar has completed 81.6% of his passes, which is not great, but not far off Hazard (.832), Ramires (.834), Willian (.836), and Lampard (.845).  He's no Mikel (.911), but seems pretty moot to me.

&gt;His vision isn't Great

He's created 30 chances, 3rd on the team with Lampard to Hazard (58), and Mata (36).

&gt;Set pieces

He's connected on 7 of the 18 corners he's taken (.389), behind Lampard (.435 of 46), Schurrle (.455 of 11), Willian (.5 of 26), and Hazard (6/10).  Again, seems moot.

Oscar really does and is capable of a bit of everything, and I think you are underestimating his well-roundedness and how he holds the team together as a no.10.

One thing you did miss though is that he has been terrible at crossing connecting on just 10 of 65 attempts.

For all intents and purposes, Lucas has always been in the side. That means we have one guy whose main job is defensive and secondary role is distribution to players usually in the same third of the pitch. 

Gerrard and Hendo have been the other CMs. With Gerrard more stationary around the center of the pitch, spraying passes, and Hendo getting forward as often as he gets back. 

People, myself included, are sort of forgetting that in the beginning of the season Hendo was used a lot out wide. Once Suarez came back and Sterling asserted himself though, this was a thing of the past. 

Ultimately, what I've found this season is that Lucas and Hendo cannot be dropped from midfield. We need Lucas' commitment in defense and Hendo's box to box ability. 

Without Lucas, I think we have to get by with Allen replacing him while maintaining the triangle mid 3. That said, I argued from the summer forward that what we needed to sign most was a DM capable of filling in for Lucas.

true,fidelcabro,,Yard of overproof rum.,"With the beer it does yes. What the box says is the minimum time it takes, if you want a beer that tastes good then a bit more time is worth it. 

If you use a one can kit (they are good) you need to add 1kg of brewing sugar or to make it better you want something called spraymalt and you add 500g of that with 500g of brewing sugar. (You can use normal sugar but that is what gives it a weird taste).

Then it is brewing it, the box will say a week. 10-12 days is more likely and it helps the beer clear more and makes sure fermenting has finished. Then it is cleaning bottles or keg and adding sugar for carbonation then leaving for a week in the warm so the yeast still in there can react again. Then a week somewhere cooler to make the bubbles smaller and its ready to drink. Well you can drink it after a week in the bottle, just stick in the fridge to chill it a bit, it has more of a just been poured from a keg mouth feel at that point.

And before you say he was never given a stretch of games neither was Willian in the beginning of the season and he broke in. Furthermore, after thirty games Juan had over 1100 minutes which is only about a game behind Willian.

And would I have sold Lamps? No, but if a player doesn't fit into the type of play the manager wants then he shouldn't be played. If Lamps had asked to leave as Mata has allegedly done I would have let him.

And maybe he has his favorites because they are the best in his system? When the results over a prolonged period of time stop then I will start to seriously question Jose. Until then he has proved at least to me to deserve at least the benefit of the doubt when decisions are made that I disagree with. 

And I agree there is no reason to sell him to United when I'm sure he could have been sent elsewhere. That wasn't my point in that statement. My point was that when you say we lack the backbone that United have for not holding onto an excellent player was wrong. We might lack brains, but not backbone.

Edit: In response to your edit, I love the club. If it helps the club *and the fucking player* to sell the player, then why not sell the fucking player. Stop acting like this club and its supporters exist to please one player over not only any other player, but the team as a whole.",0,1390428749,null,0,1390434853,0,cewaile,t3_1vuxuo,t1_cewaile,t1_cew9swb,null,1435522214,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

You make fair points, and I don't necessarily disagree with you, but I'm not quite on the same page.  (Also, my initial formation was an attempt to fit Salah into the lineup, responding to the parent comment.  It might not be the best idea to play him, necessarily- I was just figuring out where we would play him if we did.)

I don't like the Gerrard-Allen pairing in midfield.  Basically I don't like Gerrard being paired with anyone except Lucas.  Gerrard is very weak off the ball at this point.  Not physically weak, or weak in the sense of bad tackling, but he is a soft spot in our midfield that opposing teams can (and do) exploit.

I much prefer Hendo-Allen as our holding pair.  Henderson has the legs to compliment Allen's more tactical skillset.  Against Villa he was deployed farther up the pitch, I believe, and you're right that Gerrard had to be our last line of defense.  But that indicts Gerrard more than it does Hendo, I think.  Jordan played very well in his role, sending some nice passes, pressuring a lot, and yes, that sweet, sweet assist.

With the 4-2-2-2 I suggested, on defense we play our usual two-line press.  Hendo and Allen remain central and hold for the most part, so when we recover they can be there to break up counterattacks and shield the backline.  They'd be the central two in the forward line of four.  Salah and Sterling would drop back on the wings.  Suarez would come back and play the Coutinho role as the no.10 spoiler, pressuring the opposition's holding midfielders when he can.

People get into drugs for a variety of reasons but certainly in the case of heroin there's very often an abuse or trauma in the past that heroin use 'neutralises' in their mind. Now, getting someone on an even keel to talk about abuse is hard enough (look at the delay in all these BBC star's victims coming forward. Nice stable middle class folk, there). It's harder for those with chaotic lives, especially as they probably got abused in the first place by people who were supposed to be helping them. 

So, the drugs will continue to be taken whether they're given the money or whether they rob it. But if they rob it, they go to prison, which costs a fuck sight more than outreach and treatment, and further alienates them from the 'straight life'. 

Loads of people take really fucking strong, addictive drugs all the time and either don't get addicted or manage that addiction alongside everything else in their lives. It's the other factors that cause people to go off the rails with it and no amount of insisting you'll buy them a cuppa instead of giving them a quid will change that.

Then again, in a country where we'll offer people something as horrific as methadone to get them off what would with prescription be good, clean smack, there's very little hope anyway.

Best rule of thumb: these people aren't their problems, even if those are the most noticeable trait about them. They aren't a thing to be solved.

Actually the Gini Coefficient for the UK has remained fairly stable at ~0.35 since 1990, it's fluctuated around that value but there's been no real discernible trend. Basically neither the last Labour government nor the current government (as far as I can tell, statistics after 2010 are still hard to come by and somewhat dubious) has really had any impact on inequality in this country for good or for bad.

There *is* still a fairly large gap between rich and poor (compared to the rest of northern Europe for example) but that all happened during Thatcher's reign, following governments merely failed to make it any better.

No player, or manager, is bigger than the club. I love the shirt more than the player in the shirt. We shouldn't be sad or upset with anyone involved in the transfer process.

Whether we use those funds to sign a direct replacement in the remaining days in the window, or after the World Cup, I have faith that Chelsea can continue to bring in, and bring through the academy, top quality players to help up win trophies. Jose saw something in Mata that he didn't like, and believes that Mata isn't up to his standard. Whatever he saw must have been something that was unfixable in the player, enough to sell him to a direct rival. While it may look to be an odd move, it must be a part of a master plan. Jose, and the club, believe that selling Mata to a direct rival won't hurt the club, as Man U, with Mata, won't stand in our way from us achieving the success we want. If I am right in thinking how the club feels, as regards to Mata, then that is sending a strong messge. Its strange to think that this time last year, Mata was linchpin in our squad, and throughout this season he had to battle for a position in the starting lineup.

The cost is not that great for the equipment (otherwise BT wouldn't be rolling it out in select areas and charging the same installation and rental costs as for FTTC). In BT's case, the same exchange equipment and a lot of the fibre in the ground is shared for FTTC and FTTP anyway. So it's really just a few fibre splitters and the ONTs.

http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Huawei-HG8240-Gpon-optical-terminal-apply-to-FTTH-mode-with-highest-speed/484991034.html suggests that a very similar ONT to what BT use can be had for $58 dollars. I'm sure BT are getting them even cheaper in volume directly from Huawei.

The real cost is in putting the fibre in the ground - and if they're prepared to do that to get it to the pole, I really don't see how there's an enormous extra cost to string it across the road to the home. 

Pole-top DSLAMs mean extra cost, extra maintenance, significant power requirements (getting power to their FTTC cabinets can be a challenge, what about to thousands more poles? - and what about any battery backup?). FTTP has none of this.

Even BT's existing FTTC/P planning is mind boggling. My road has FTTC. One of the other roads in the village has FTTP. Both have entirely overhead wiring, both have existing cabinets (so it's not because the lines are direct to the exchange so FTTC is not possible).

For example, take a look at how long it took Malouda to settle in and play well. Take a look at how long it took Ivanovic to settle in as our first choice RB. The variables involved in something as big as a football club are infinitely great.

You speak of this ""system"" as though it is some static idea. Jose has played over 5 different varieties of systems and he will continue to play various different types of systems in his Chelsea career. Yes, players need to track back, and Mata was learning that. But to give up on a player in half a season is not justifiable. And its not the first time Jose has done something like this. 

&gt; If Lamps had asked to leave as Mata has allegedly done I would have let him.

You would've let Lamps join Man UTD?? Disgraceful.

&gt; And maybe he has his favorites because they are the best in his system? When the results over a prolonged period of time stop then I will start to seriously question Jose. Until then he has proved at least to me to deserve at least the benefit of the doubt when decisions are made that I disagree with.

I don't have a problem with Jose's system. I have a problem with bias. I have a problem with his lack of neutrality. I have a problem with his lack of communication with the players he doesn't play. KDB wasn't given a fair chance either. Why not speak to them and explain what the situation is? Because when you have a certain idea in your mind you don't really care. THIS is the attitude, the lack of compassion with the player and a disregard to fans' sentiment regarding players that I have a problem with. Jose said in one of his press conferences that he doesn't have a problem selling players to rival teams... Why the fuck not? The fans don't want it, so why the hell do you?

&gt; And I agree there is no reason to sell him to United when I'm sure he could have been sent elsewhere. That wasn't my point in that statement. My point was that when you say we lack the backbone that United have for not holding onto an excellent player was wrong. We might lack brains, but not backbone.

Wrong again. The reason Man UTD don't want to sell us Rooney is because they know Rooney is exactly what we need - just like Mata is exactly what they need. Instead, UTD have stood their ground and we are selling Mata to them for absolutely no reason. Hence the backbone comment.

In my opinion the less government interference in the free market the better, and when it does need to interfere it should be to split up disruptive monopolies to ensure free competition happens which is almost always best for the consumer. I don't believe that forcibly taking taxpayers money to pay for the production of a material good is ever good practice unless the free market is refusing to produce that good, which would be very surprising if there was demand. An example of this would be solar panels, you used to be able to get them for about £1.5k each, then the government introduced the green subsidies and the price shot up by almost exactly as much as the subsidy. It didn't happen instantly, but it did eventually after a couple of years. 

With regards to social housing, you could insist that all building companies that accepted the VAT break would have to build 20% of their properties as social housing. You can sure as hell bet the private economy will work out a way to build what you need and still make a profit. You'd have to actually put some effort into ensuring they were up to standard and the same as all the other houses, perhaps the VAT break could be in the form of a time delayed rebate.

Yeah but I think the conditions in Japan are so incredibly unique - they might call it a lost decade but in many respects the Japanese still have an absolutely booming economy, with an enviable unemployment rate of something like 4% which is at a historical high! At any rate I'm not sure there are many lessons for us to learn from Japan. Their geographical position and high-tech manufacturing orientated economy puts them quite literally a world apart from us. They, much like the US, find themselves in the strange position of having an economy on paper which doesn't reflect the reality on the ground. 

Ironically, if there *is* anything to learn from japan its probably how they have managed their own housing and aging demographic issues. In a nutshell, their solution has mostly been to [build up on a big scale](http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/multimedia/dynamic/00247/tokyo-main_247542k.jpg) with more consideration for micro-living from the outset. i.e. they accept space will be small and plan around it with admittedly varying success. Because of cultural differences in the way families operate there is also a middle-class norm of living in these apartment type dwellings which have 2 self contained but connected 2-3 bedroom apartments. The first apartment tends to be for the grandparents and the second tends to be for the working age adults and children. In essence its a granny annex, only the granny annex is a like-for-like duplicate of the main property (or close to). It's been a very cost effective way to obtain properties. They also have a special mortgage product that goes for something like 99 years and is intended for a single family to keep a house through several generations (unless they sell up and move on). It makes it very affordable. ",0,1390431456,null,0,1390432034,0,cewbxwg,t3_1vubmc,t1_cewbxwg,t1_cew9qok,null,1432061190,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Ignore this. ATOS does not go out to make examples. However they do have targets to meet, and Mental Health does not fit the WCA criteria very well at all which is a nice easy win for them. Ideally to them, many more people would go through ATOS so they could meet their targets even quicker allowing them to be more generous with the genuinely needy.

This letter of yours is all well and good. But you've managed to sit there and type out a coherent letter without any assistance as far as I am aware (so an office job would be great, right? ;)). How many points do you think they will deduct for that? DO NOT HELP THEM SCREW YOU - they are not there to help you - do not attempt to appeal to them lest you be caught easily in one of the WCA questions. They are merely ticking boxes based upon a quick and largely unqualified assessment. 

They are not there to determine whether there are realistic employment opportunities for you. They are merely there to see how many points you get against the WCA. That is all they do.

&gt;If I had to label the major phenomena

No self diagnosis. Get a doctor or qualified Mental Health professional to claim it in writing and use this as supporting evidence. This probably won't help your WCA but it may help your appeal.

You seem reasonably competent, so take a look at this;

https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/248826/esa214-rev-oct2013.pdf - pg18+

You need more than 15 points in either area OR more than 15 points combined. Adjust how you act in the interview appropriately. As you describe mental health issues, ultimately you are fit for work in Physical Activity so will probably fall foul of the very first question. For this you need to aim specifically to be placed in the ESA Support Group (Q11+) rather than Work-related activity. Maybe you can walk and lift generally, but maybe you can't do it if there is anyone near by watching. Etcetc. Maybe you can use a kettle but as soon as someone walks into the kitchen you lose concentration and have the potential to cause injury? Maybe you are so nervous in unfamiliar/crowded areas you black out? Look at every descriptor and think how you would cope with it in various situations.

I am not telling you to game the system. I am merely telling you how the system works so you don't slip up in areas you really ought not too.

Make a statement of facts, each paragraph only a single sentence or two:

* I am severely unhealthy; I am overweight, my blood pressure the last three times I’ve had it checked has been around 110/180, and I barely sleep.

* I have incontinence issues; I often find myself having wet the bed at night after waking up from night terrors, and during the day, my bowel movements result in excessive gas issues, and excreta escaping in an often fluid form.

* If I had the money, I would ensure that I had at least one clean pair of shorts, but I cannot afford regular laundry, so I often wear dirty underwear. I probably smell.

* Due to my obesity (??) I can no longer touch my toes without severe ache. Standing up takes a lot of effort and if I do so even for the shortest of times, I experience sharp pain in my lower back, and find that I have to sit down to ease the pain.

* I have constant lower back pain that requires medication on a regular basis for temporary respite.

* I can not walk to the end of my road - about 100 metres - without feeling extreme discomfort in my lower back. Doing so leaves me out of breath, and I need to rest for a few minutes even walking 10 metres from my front door.

In the UK it's a bit different.

Instead you had small groups running about everywhere and evading police. If you used the water cannon they'd just run off and cause trouble some place else before the cannon can get there.

The water cannon is for confrontations with large crowds. The only way that's likely to happen outside of NI is with large demonstrations, so in the near future it will be anti-austerity protests.

Luckily, this isn't the case with everyone I meet, obviously it isn't, it would be absurd for me to say that *everyone* does this to me, so upon meeting some people it's refreshing not to have to go through the same boring old routine,  listening to them casually generalise where I was raised or where I live in the first few seconds of our very first conversation and expect my mind to be blown with their sheer originality, and, the ones who think about things and choose not to put me through it ultimately do gain my interest and respect, because they're not ""one of those guys"" - it's a nice and welcomed change.",0,1390432173,null,0,false,0,cewcaba,t3_1vuc1r,t1_cewcaba,t1_cevvefc,null,1432061354,1,false,brum,t5_2rdjk,1

It tells you the wattage and guesses the price/CO² emissions but they're based off averages so probably wrong. I read the wattage, multiply by the number of hours and the leccy cost in KW/h (average about 11p).

It's not just about keeping the shape of the team instead of poncing about and barely staying on side - though that's important - it's about:

*  Harassing - pressing - the opposition the player(s) you are marking. It's often 2 for the central attacking mid as they have to press both central/defensive midfielders of a 4231. Oscar and Willian are particularly good at pressing two midfielders at once, Schuerrle is good for one, and I thought De Bruyne was pretty decent as well. 

* Denying them space to play through good positioning and reading of the play. This means cutting off passing options and tracking runners without letting them open you up. A particular example for a wide player is covering an overlapping fullback. Willian is amazing at this and it destroys the oppositions ability to break quickly down our right.

true,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,"I can't say we were ever really in the running, as nice as it would've been.  I don't think there's a team in the world really which Mata wouldn't improve (and that includes Chelsea), so of course it would've been great to nab him.  I would happily sit any of our players in his favour, but could you imagine playing a 4-2-3-1 with Adebayor up top, and Eriksen/Mata/Lamela just behind him?  That would've been glorious.

I still think it's a bizarre decision for everyone though.  Mata goes to a club on a downward swing, who though still in the Champions League this year, have no realistic chance of winning it and quite likely won't be in next year's edition.

Chelsea sell to one of their bitterest rivals, who although they don't play for the rest of the season in the league, they could still wind up playing in the Champions League.  And of course Mata is there next season too anyway.

Not only that, they're selling arguably their best player (beside only perhaps Hazard) and a fan favourite.  Even if he doesn't fit into Mourinho's immediate plans, he's probably the best benchwarmer in the world right now.  I know he will not be content to sit on the bench in a World Cup year, but there are so many other clubs he could go to that would be a better fit for him.

And for Man Utd, it appears a massive coup except for the fact that Mata is a very different type of player to what Utd traditionally field.  It's been a long time since they've had a true #10... Utd tended to prefer wing play rather than through the middle.  The only way I can see Mata working is if they play him further back alongside Carrick or whatever joker they've currently got in deep midfield (which will rob them of defensive steel and play to Mata's weaknesses), or sit/sell Rooney.

Obviously the club sees in him  a gifted individual who is a fan favorite. No matter his playing time or his role in the current squad. So they're weighing that in against something. My guess is that its again Arsenal/Man City. With a player like Mata, utd might be able to dock some points from those teams while not really contesting us seeing as we have played them already. 

""But Mashful, clearly they cannot have such a short sighted outlook, what about next year?""
 
Next Year is a different story, we have the money to bring full-fledged wingers, which is what we need given we only have Schurrle. Or an incredible AM (which unlike world class CMs and Strikers are bountiful). A player of Mata's CLASS is hard to come by, but a player that fits Jose's vision and skill isn't impossible.

Mata allegedly asked for a transfer. If this is true (or if we ever know one way or another) then Juan just got fed up. Understandable, and he should have left. 

The system he's shown so far involves being able to have all players press and track back. That's the system he's used in every game I can think of this time around and it's worked well, why would he change it?

I never said I would have sold him to United, don't put words in my mouth. I even said that I disagree with him Mata being sold to United in my previous post, so to make sure you understand since it appears you did not comprehend it all: I disagree with us selling to domestic rivals. 

And how do you know he didn't speak to them? Maybe he did and they told him they don't need to adapt their style of play? I'm not saying he did or did not, we simply do not know. All we can do is judge based on their game performances, and those simply were not good enough.

And his job is not to make the fans happy, his job is to win. And for his first season back to be two points behind first after 22 games with the two teams ahead of us facing hard games ahead is winning enough for me so far.

And Mata is not exactly what they need. He will certainly be helpful, but United need a lot more than a creative central attacking midfielder. Arguably he doesn't fit into their current style of play at all unless Moyes is planning a sizable overhaul. Furthermore, what has selling Mata been to us? We've lost someone who has been largely a squad player this season. Compared to a highly important played for United who can play in numerous positions.

Liverpool were desperate for a striker after losing Torres and way overpaid in the dying hours of the transfer window. Not to mention Liverpool/Newcastle are not battling each other for a PL title season in and season out. Manchester United are desperate to save their season and not miss out on CL next year; we are doing fine and don't need to sell. If Andy Carroll is the standard for stupid money transfers, then Mata shouldn't go for less than 50. The only thing that could change that is if Rooney was involved.

If Jose is arguably the best manager in the world, then he should be able to find a way to use one of the best players in the world at his position. I thought he was so highly lauded for working with what he has and not forcing a system on any player or team?

Obviously its good for United, but that is certainly not a reason to sell him. And its definitely not necessary for Chelsea. If breaking even is so important right now then I expect to see Hazard to PSG next week; gotta keep those books in line right?

Mata is one of my favorite players and I'd do anything to see him in the middle of the attack for Chelsea, but there is nothing in his contract that says he has to play in a WC year. We should keep him for depth, you know since we were laughed at for having so many AMs earlier in the season and now we are down to 4 for 3 spots with a lot of matches coming up. Or loan him somewhere for the rest of the season and see what happens in the summer.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"Few pointers as I read:

* Drop the first bit where you vent your frustrations. If you want to do that (which is fine) just write a separate letter of complaint and go through their complaints procedure. I would just get to your point quickly - right now you are hovering on tl:dr territory. (Evil as they may be ATOS are only human and if you present them with a wall of text they will be less likely to read each line carefully).

* On that note, I would try to make the whole thing a ton more concise - aim for 600-700 words maximum. Get rid of all the added guff that doesn't make your point (e.g. *""All of this, it must be said, are physical ailments""* / *""So what’s wrong with me? To list physical encumbrance""* / *""In addition to all of this""* etc. to label but a few)

* Try to make it read more like: *""In 2006 I injured my wrist when falling down a flight of stairs. I was hospitalized for 1 night and followed up as an outpatient. I have since been diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome and take ibuprofen and paracetamol to control the pain. Despite these treatments I am unable to use my left hand to grip for more than a few minutes. In particular this makes using a computer unbearably painful even with wrist supports and ergonomic keyboards.""* Then go onto your next paragraph and repeat the process... *""I have had chronic lower back pain since 2002...""*

* 110/180 isn't a blood pressure that is physically possible within the laws of this universe. You possibly mean 180/110? That is fine - but I wouldn't lead with it, since having hypertension in and of itself doesn't preclude you from work. It's just a risk factor for other illnesses like stroke and heart disease.

* Lead with the depression and anxiety, then the continence issues. Mention at the end you are overweight and suffer from hypertension. 

* Don't refer to it as excreta. Say you have frequent loose bowel motions associated with anxiety. Remember being incontinent again [isn't a reason why you can't work from their perspective](http://www.ageukincontinence.co.uk/incontinence-shop/disposable-incontinence-products/adult-nappies.html?gclid=CN3u6-73krwCFesJwwodczIAiQ) so don't get too caught up on it. 

* For your own dignity I would drop the bits about personal hygiene. I'm not sure I really see your argument for how money =/= hygiene and I don't think they will really consider it. Again, unpleasant though it may be, poor personal hygiene doesn't preclude you from working. Its use is more to demonstrate you have a severe anxiety disorder that will be exacerbated by the stresses of working.

* You need to go into specific details about these old injuries to your wrist and back. Explain (concisely!) how they happened in perhaps 1 (maximum) sentence. Then in the following sentence explain how that affects you now.

* Document any and all interactions you have had with the health services. For example if your mental health issues have ever led you to be sectioned or voluntarily treated in a psychiatric hospital. Whether your wrist or back pain relate to surgery or any relevant hospitalisations.   

Anyway, it reads well of course, but I would just change tack slightly and focus in on the physical aspects that are preventing you from working. Then make the whole thing much more concise. Portraying yourself and your life as pathetic does nothing for you as an individual, makes it hard for them to relate to you as a person and doesn't contribute to your cause. Do of course go into the anxiety/depression but I would focus (concisely!) on the physical symptoms like early morning waking, restlessness, incontinence, suicidal thoughts etc.",0,1390433873,null,0,1390434301,0,cewd37n,t3_1vvqwx,t1_cewd37n,t3_1vvqwx,null,1432061798,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

&gt;The big 3 parties have nearly 18,000 councillors in the UK, it's only to be expected that you can dig something up on at least a few individuals amongst those many thousands.

&gt;In contrast there are 217 UKIP councillors who really seem to be out performing their rivals when it comes to rates of bigotry and/or criminality.

&gt;In my city for example UKIP's highest profile candidate at the last council elections had to be thrown out the party when his admiration Anders Breivik's manifesto came to light.

Contrary to your self refuting argument UKIP haven't just been like this since the BNP got into difficulties, they've always been like this because this is the true nature of the party, which is why despite farages occasional libertarian posturing last year they kicked out their youth leader for not being a racist, sexist and homophobic BNP exile [but for not being sufficiently homophobic](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ukip-youth-leader-olly-neville-sacked-for-supporting-gay-marriage-8444330.html).

&gt; Rooney will certainly leave in the summer

I think this unlikely actually. We all know how important a player he is to the team. Much more likely that he will be kept and let to run out his contract, with the intention of buying players in the summer (our targets seem ambitious i.e Vidal/Gundogan/Koke, but I think we're likely to bring at least one in the summer) that will hopefully improve our play and persuade Rooney to stay. He's not far off some of our club records which may be an added incentive. I know you have seemingly just sold us Mata, but if you think you're likely to get Rooney from us because of that then you're being way over the top. You could afford to say bye to Mata because he didn't fit your plan, while Rooney is our squad's centrepiece and selling him to you would pretty much complete you into an unbeatable squad. We won't hand over dominance of the PL to you and City so simply, just to return a favour.

The purchase of Mata signals what looks like a shift in footballing philosophy for us. Our biggest problem is basically our failure to properly replace Ronaldo, and our insistence on wing-play. Our wingers are simply not good enough, but if we adopted what is essentially the Chelsea formation, then we suddenly have a variety of options that create a *very* potent attack in Mata/Rooney/Kagawa/Januzaj/Nani, all playing behind one of the best strikers in the game - Van Persie.  

There's a lot of talk about our 'war chest' for the summer, but what also needs to be remembered is the huge amount of sponsor money that we've secured over the last year. This is our way of going toe-to-toe with you and City financially, and I think probably signals our acceptance that being stubborn about being a club that doesn't spend in the same way that you guys can will ultimately spell our doom. Dropping out of the CL for a season won't really effect our budget too much, and we'll be able to bag a quality midfielder by throwing money at them and the added incentive that they'll be pretty much guaranteed regular playing time.

I'll accept that you and City and perhaps Arsenal will strengthen, and I can't see us reclaiming a *dominant* position on the league like we've had in the past, but we'll certainly be back seriously contending for the title next season.",1,1390434876,null,0,false,0,cewdjn5,t3_1vvwsg,t1_cewdjn5,t1_cewcyl4,null,1432062084,0,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,0

I actively *like* the libertarian idea of ""government shouldn't be involved in marriage"", but hearing this in the context of gay marriage, it's only ever applied to one side of the equation.

People saying ""government shouldn't be involved in marriage"" never have a decent plan to end civil marriage for straight people - to allow churches and non-religious celebrants to marry anyone, but to make that legally meaningless without filing a civil partnership. They never have a plan to replace civil marriage with civil partnership for everyone, allowing straight couples to simply fill in a form to legalise hospital visiting, inheritance and co-parenting rights. 

You might get the odd person on forums like this one saying ""that's a great idea"", and some of those people might even be 'kippers, but the parties advocating against gay marriage never have a structured and organised proposal towards some other form of equality.

I have to admit that I haven't looked at that page closely - like you I find it hard to read after a couple of paragraphs.

But what I suspect this is, is rationalisation of a homophobic stance into pseudo-reasonable terms - I would guess that, like all other UKIP policies, a policy intended to appeal to ""traditional England"" older voters is explained as ""libertarian"" for those who don't vote entirely with their prejudices.

UKIP would rationalise a proposal to arm British bobbies with longbows as ""reinvigorating the British archery industry, bringing back jobs to British bowyers and fletchers"" if they thought it would win more votes. They would point to the massive unharvested national resource of yew trees in British churchyards and bemoan how the mainstream political parties had allowed this waste so long.

We did not use the K1 fiancé visa process so I don't know everything about it so could you please explain how you can work legally after 90 days? You need either a social security or a work permit?
And you can apply for citizenship after two, not four years?


Regardless of whether you're right about this, my point is, unless you have thousands in the bank and years worth of patience, becoming an American citizen I an objectively difficult thing to do. 

The bigger issue is you saying ""marry a yank"" in such a blasé way. This is very dangerous advice. The officers assess your marriage with a fine toothed comb: we had to show photos of us together; phone bills to prove we'd called each other while long distance; letters we wrote; magazine subscriptions addressed to the two of us; answer questions at interview such as ""when was her last period""/""what is his favourite sex position"" and have our body language and relationship scrutinized.

You cannot just marry a yank for a green card, they will find out and send you home.


EDIT: Sorry OP, this chat probably isn't helpful to you. In response to your question, if you don't have any immediate relatives with foreign citizenship then the EU is your best bet but still costly and time consuming.

""She was then kicked not once, but 3 times, breaking her leg. Which is why ""Scotland Yard said it was taking the allegations “extremely seriously” and ""Investigators supervised by the Independent Police Complaints Commission have interviewed several officers.""

Read those two parts of what you have just said. Can you see the parallel yet? If you had used force to defend yourself (or effect the arrest of an offender, which as a citizen you may do in certain circumstances) and there was an allegation that you had assaulted that person then either you could be arrested, or more likely interviewed under caution without having been arrested. The officers would have produced statements and are now being interviewed based on that.  

Whenever force is used police are required to (in one slightly differing form or another) required to write a statement about it. This serves in lieu of an interview because to conduct an interview each and every time force is used would be far from practicable. However when a complaint is made and it is deemed that it is not suitable for local resolution (such as in a case like this) it will be passed to the DPS or directorate of professional standards, who will investigate the matter. So in both cases there is an analysis. 

""And the article itself says this: ""Police started pushing back the anti-fascists, and when a snatch squad tried to arrest a man linking arms with Ms Jowett she claims another officer kicked her left leg (my bolds)."" In other words, the man himself was obstructing his arrest and the police lashed out at those around him in an attempt to separate him.""

I can see your point here, if he was attempting to take hold of her and she did not reciprocate. However any number of stories may be embellished and since you seem to be keen to, on such a minimal and likely very biased account to apply such scrutiny to the police, the same scrutiny might be applied to her. We don't know if she was screaming ""Get him off me"" or ""what are you doing"" or if on the other hand it was ""Don't touch him."" ""I won't let you take him."" Of course those are suppositions and at the extreme end of the spectrum but the point I'm trying to impress here is that we don't know the finer details at this stage. We only have her word for it she was kicked three times.

It is unfair as yet to accuse the officers of assaulting this woman when they have not so much as been arrested on suspicion of the offence let alone charged or having been convicted having been tried before a jury of their peers.  I haven't defended their actions, that is for the individual officer to do, I am not saying that I know what happened. The opposite. I am saying it is too early to judge, especially when we're far from being in possession of the full facts. Let us not forget that the media tends to be very sensationalist.

The title says it all. 'Saying goodbye to Juan Mata is something Chelsea fans shouldn't have to do so soon'. 

Edit: Writer makes a point which I've not heard other say before much but which has crossed my mind before. Here's the bit:

&gt; (Anyone who things that) that either of those two (Oscar and Hazard) won't head to Real Madrid, PSG, or Barcelona in three years time is fooling themselves

I don't know about Oscar, but I can't see Hazard staying long term. His current contract runs till 2017, so if he doesn't sign an extension we'll have to let him go in 2016 at the latest. It's a worrying thought that one of if not both of the players we're building our attack around could leave in just a couple of years time. As the writer notes, it was different with Juan:

&gt;Here's a lad that by all accounts genuinely gets the significance of Chelsea Football Club. He understands the history, the legends that pre-date him, and just how passionate a fan base we are. He could have been the future, the foundation, a leader, a captain, a legend. He would have been happy to stay for seasons on end, playing in Blue.  

Instead we'll have to see him playing for them.

At the moment it is very rare ([see here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_residency_in_English_law)) for parents to be allowed to ""share"" the child. Instead it is up to the judges to decide, and unfortunately the precedents have been set to really favour mothers unless there is evidence that the mother is not capable of caring for the child.

I posted this today because of a friend going through a really awful court case to try and get to see his daughter. My friend has a PhD, is a radiographer, and is an incredibly nice man, there is absolutely no reason for a judge to question his ability to care for his daughter. He was told that unfortunately it is very unusual for fathers to get custody when the mother is not somehow unfit to care for their child.

[Wikipedia points out](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_Act_1989#Welfare_of_the_child) that if the couple are unmarried then the father does not have parental responsibility, so must agree to share residency of the child, and that is up to the mother (or child) entirely.

India. It's not too hard to become a ""non-resident"" Indian citizen - there is a process, with fees, people you need to get onboard etc - like every country. But in principle you can become an Indian citizen resident in India for less than 6 months a year, as long as you spend the other six months elsewhere. I personally know someone who has done this and spends a few months in the UK, a few months elsewhere, and half the year in India. They live near the Nepali border which is a help, as you can easily get a tourist visa for Nepal and stay there very cheaply.

It is *not* for everyone. It was a straightforward but time-consuming and involved process becoming Indian, but my friend had the advantage that they can make a living at what they do - and money talks.

It's easily done in the sense that as long as you can demonstrate that you are not going to be a financial burden to India, and as long as you are prepared to spend less than 6 months there per year, and as long as you can establish ""local connections"" sufficient to persuade an official, you can probably do it.

And I think this is the specific bit the F4J are referring to 

&gt; At the same time, I also think we need to make Britain a genuinely hostile place for fathers who go AWOL. It’s high time runaway dads were stigmatised, and the full force of shame was heaped upon them. They should be looked at like drink drivers, people who are beyond the pale. They need the message rammed home to them, from every part of our culture, that what they’re doing is wrong – that leaving single mothers, who do a heroic job against all odds, to fend for themselves simply isn’t acceptable.

And there was some further controversy about him stating he wanted to support single parents when 

&gt; the government announced proposals to encourage parents to reach their own arrangements over child maintenance - rather than relying on the CMEC - by charging those unable to do so.



&gt;They would be required to pay an upfront fee of £100 (or £50 if they claim benefits), plus an ongoing charge of between 7% and 12% of the money paid where payments are collected and enforced by the CMEC.

&gt;Fiona Weir, from the charity Gingerbread - which campaigns on behalf of single parents - also criticised the proposals.

&gt;""If the prime minister really wants to support heroic single parents, he must withdraw these damaging proposals which would limit access to the CSA,"" she said.

true,abowsh,1986,Oscar,"Most players recognize that soccer is a business. We don't know exactly how things went down. Maybe Mata did ask for a transfer so he could be in form for the World Cup. Spain is one of the favorites, but they may not be in another four years. Playing regular football will help him stay in form and solidify his role with Spain. For almost every player, the World Cup trumps all else. It is very possible that Mata asked to be sent to another club where he would be a regular starter.

I hate to see him go, but I think we all saw this coming. The performances out of Hazard, Willian, Oscar, and Shurrle have established them as the favorites of Jose. Long term, we still have some very talented attacking midfielders in Moses, Piazon, Little Hazard and maybe even Marin waiting for their chance. The emergence of Luiz as a very capable defensive midfielder is allowing Ramires to get more time in an attacking role. We have many talented players in his position. 

I think letting a great player sit on the bench would send an even worse message to other players. Mata deserves to play. He is a world class player. The Mata we saw this year was not the Mata of years past. Maybe his diminished form was a result of a lack of playing time, I don't know. But, it was obvious that Mata was not playing as well this year as he was over the last two years. 

Mata will always be remembered. He was key to us winning the Champions League. He will get a standing ovation when he returns to the Bridge as he deserves. He also deserves to play. We know we have a very talented manager and we are seeing his vision come to fruition over the last month or so. I will trust them on this move, I just hate that he had to go to United.

We dont need to replace both CMs, just buy a box-to-box that can allow Carrick to sit further back in a Scholes-esque role to pull the strings. His passing is still fantastic but he lacks the mobility to do it all on his own.

Januzaj's age is a bit of a moot point. He's top class regardless of the fact that he's 18, your best player isnt *much* older, and I would argue that he's better than Hazard was at 18 (though Hazard is a fucking machine, I'm gutted that we missed out on him, perhaps you can take solace in that fact regarding the whole Mata deal).

They already have Rooney, Januzaj and Kagawa competing for the #10 and now Mata is added to that clusterfuck. He can't play wide as we all know so Manure are literally spending 37 million pounds adding to a position of strength. That is 37 milllion that can't be spent on a class LB, CM, CDM and a quality winger, not to mention a quality striker as vanPersie is aging. 

Now with that in mind, even with Mata, Manure are gonna be hard pressed to get top 4 this season. No Champions League, no extra money, combine that with the fact that they'll have to qualify for Europa instead of their lucrative preseason tour, Manure could be royally fucked in the ass with no CL to attract top quality players and no money to fix their true areas of need. I truly believe this move will cripple Manure within the year and Mourinho seems to realize it too. This is akin to us buying Torres (panic buy that doesn't fit the team) but unlike us Manure don't have bottomless wallets.

P.S. Calm down your boners for Juan. He couldn't adapt and the Chelsea today WITHOUT him looks better than the Chelsea WITH him.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Go on, give more one more reason this is in anyway a positive deal for us?

Maybe one reason that players like to work for Jose so much is that he treats them with respect and not as assets or pawns. Maybe he, like Wenger did with RVP and Cesc, understands the human element of managing a football team and this sort of move shows he respects the player. This shows the other players in the squad (and potential players) that Jose is someone to respect and is on their side which helps build the team going forward. Maybe there's more to managing 30 professional athletes than adding together their stats.  

Maybe he knows the transfer plans for Chelsea over the next 12 months and thinks selling to a team that has a new manager, that will need to adapt to a new style of playmaker and is sitting a dozen points behind them on the table is only going to help those plans.

It seems she is just saying 'You should look for an entry level job before looking for your dream job even if it's low paid' which is perfect sense. 

At the same time I don't think young people need to be told this; it's not rocket science, I just think there aren't that many entry level jobs in the career paths people want. If I do a engineering degree because I want to be an engineer then an entry level job as Costa is utterly useless except for money so as not to die. If there are not enough entry level jobs in engineering then your in a bit of a dilemma; incidental the people I know wouldn't turn down that job if they needed it to live. Given the rise in part time jobs when people want to be full time I don't think the issue is people not being committed enough. People want full time jobs but are forced to take part time ones.

I'm certainly not saying that assembling a team of that caliber is as easy a feat these days, but I do still vividly remember the raw power, pace, and physicality of that team walking over the rest of the league. I still remember Drogba practically bludgeoning Arsenal into submission over and over again.

Nine regenerated into Ten out of love for Rose, making him a lovable puppy that went through the galaxies wagging his tail at everyone he met for the most part. Ten regenerated into Eleven after a farewell tour to all of his friends, making him hyper, yet you could always tell he was hiding gloom behind his child-like facade. Eleven regenerated under the knowledge that the Time Lords were still alive and once again approved of him enough to grant him a new regeneration cycle.

Having Sturridge back + bringing in Salah will allow us to rotate him so that he'll be fresh when he starts and we can see his best stuff. 

Dunno enough about Salah's play style yet to make an assessment, but he could theoretically be helpful with Coutinho's situation too. If we can rotate Alberto and maybe Salah into Coutinho's spot every now and then when he's having a down spell, it could possibly help him out a lot.

**My suggestions - Birmingham Cross City Line**:

Longbridge to see the cross city trains do their reversal.

Longbridge and Barnt Green for accelerating expresses and freight, where Longbridge is middle tracks so the sound isn't quite so blocked. Barnt Green gives you more viewing time per train. Longbridge is my personal favourite out of all of these.

Bromsgrove is at the foot of the lickey incline so you get to watch expresses thunder up/down it for quite a while and if you're really lucky, a freight. If you're super super lucky you'll see a banker too.

I haven't been but I plan to go to Lichfield Trent Valley where I believe the middle-track-through-trains are up to 125mph.

Sutton Park has freight throughout the day and you can cross the tracks in parts.

**Elsewhere:**

Marsten Green lets you see the london bound pendos doing a wallop as they approach Bham Int'l, as well as the odd Arriva 158. LM Desiros stop there. Bonus: you can walk 10-15 minutes to Sheldon Park and have planes either landing or taking off over your head, depending which way they're running at that point. You will hear the planes from the station.

Millenium Point in Birmingham (Curzon Street) has a park that gives you a great view of what I believe is Proof House Jn, east of Birmingham New Street, you get to see all the arrivals and departures.

Further out is Crewe which has a whole ton of freight, passenger, light engines and the occasional steam special, including the occasional non stopping pendo.

And lastly far more far flung is the famous Dawlish Sea Wall. Last time I looked you can get there advance for £38 each way, a 3 hour journey from Birmingham. But a very unique view. [Image of the entire view from one of the rocks you can climb](http://fineartamerica.com/featured/1-dawlish-sea-wall-rob-hawkins.html) [Another image from the wall itself. Trains pass at upto 70mph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sprey_Point_221128.jpg)

Lastly a resource: http://realtimetrains.co.uk/ you can search for stations and click detailed to see non stoppers too. If you click the places that aren't stations, e.g. Sutton Park (sadly you can't search for non stations directly), it also shows you through trains to those points.

And one more resource: http://railwayherald.com/railtours which is a well maintained list of what specials are running and when.

2. That's a stupid argument when we can easily nationalise companies if they are taking the piss. Just like Transport for London. People are being strong armed into paying those prices so they can live somewhat closer to work. Which is in kin to blackmail almost. 

3. Talking out of your arse, the min wage even if raised will still be under the living wage. People who make min wage will soon not be able to live in the capitol. I know some people who while working have had to move as they cannot afford the rent as they get paid low wages.

4. The reason it is so expensive in london hails form a very rich tory who gained a lot of money from not paying tax. Then bought up properties in different areas. You need to stop making shit up.

5. Approvals are different to actual houses being built.

6. Also good, one of the only thing that this government has done partially right. But this only applies to people if they can find more then part time work. As their new work schemes are a load of shit. 

7. They are thinking about raising min wage, and even then, like i said it is not enough. Still under the living wage.

8. Also a nonsense value. Yet you don't even show figures. House prices are still way over what they should be. Houses are not being built fast enough. The tories have fallen well short of their promise to build houses.

9. Musicians and athletes don't hold your money, don't invest it. If you don't care about one then that'e fine. You don't have to listen to their music or watch them. But if a banker pisses your money away then it effects you. What a stupid comparison. None of the bankers (who fund the tories and have some of the mps on their boards) have been arrest and charged for fraud. They get a get out of jail free card. It happened under a labour government, but it was a bunch of tory arseholes who caused this mess.

Take your head out of the tories arse, you have shit on your nose. Remember the only place you can go when you are at the bottom is up. Doesn't mean you are out of the shit.",0,1390447812,null,0,false,0,cewjkfy,t3_1vubmc,t1_cewjkfy,t1_cewhh5l,null,1432065151,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;Despite an overall revenue increase of £17.5m (9%) to £206.2m (€240.6m), Liverpool fall three places in this year’s Money League, from ninth to twelfth. 

-----

&gt;The Reds’ strong commercial growth, coupled with their continued absence from the Champions League, means that commercial revenue now accounts for 47% of total revenue. At £97.7m (€114m), Liverpool’s commercial revenue is higher than both London-based Champions League clubs, Arsenal and Chelsea, and is bettered only by the Money League’s top six.

----

&gt;the Money League’s highest- placed non-Champions League club may well
re-enter the top ten next year despite their absence from the competition in 2013/14, thanks to the new Premier League broadcast deals.... it would appear that the club’s future is looking significantly brighter than its recent past",0,1390448670,null,0,false,0,cewjz4n,t3_1vwv6l,t1_cewjz4n,t3_1vwv6l,null,1432065383,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

true,YoungFoxyandFree,present,null,"Mata never even got a run of games to try to be fantastic. I think 2, maybe 3 games was his longest streak all season and I can count on one hand how many times he played 90 minutes. 60 minutes here and 20 minutes off the bench there doesn't get you in form. I guess he doesn't fit the system and Jose saw this in training and decided he was so inadequate he can't even play. Until recently our strikers haven't been able to score and we tried a false 9 earlier in the season; does he not deserve a shot in that position, maybe even rotating with Hazard, Oscar, and Shurrle/Willian? Again though, I'm sure Jose tried in training but didn't see it. 

Oscar has been fantastic this season and I admit I had my doubts and thought he was a little overrated, but he's cleared that up nicely. That said though there have been times this season where Oscar has not shown up yet plays the whole match. If Mata isn't the man of the match though he's the first to be subbed off. I understand that Oscar is better defensively and maybe I'm just clueless on the finer points of our system, but Mata can press to some extent and I don't see why we need 10 on defense at every loss of possession. 

I think Oscar is too direct to be our central playmaker. Mata is so much more deliberate and patient on the ball which is why he is the best creator of chances in the league. I like Oscar more as a deeper playmaker a la Lampard over the past few seasons who has the ability to start a play from the defense or midfield and end up in the box to finish it too.

Juan Mata, who crawled through a river of shit and came out red on the other side. Juan Mata, headed for Manchester. Those of us who knew him best talk about him often. I swear, the stuff he pulled... Sometimes it makes me sad, though, Juan being gone. I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged. Their feathers are just too bright and when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice, but still, the place you live in is that much more drab and empty now that they're gone. I guess I just miss my friend.

Two things immediately jump out at me:

* Even without Champions League for a number of seasons, it's nice to see that we're doing well business-wise.
* However, the gulf between LFC and the teams *with* Champions League is still pretty significant.

I feel as if there have been a lot of commentary since FSG's ownership about whether our owners have money or not. It's clear that they do have money. However, we have to constantly remind ourselves how monumentally *awful* the Hicks &amp; Gillett era was and FSG essentially saved our club from the unthinkable. This means FSG is constantly repairing the damage done and - in the way Rodgers is doing with the squad - FSG is creating long-term stability in Liverpool FC as a business. And don't fool yourself, the business of sport **is** a business.

Right now I feel as if we're on the razor's edge: A spending spree (i.e. ""Why not Mata?"") get us to 4th place (or more) and that Champions League money. But if that gamble fails then what? More financial instability. But, at the same time, can we afford to *not* do anything in this January window? I'm not so sure about that.

But the numbers show that there is stability and some forward progress and the owners are looking for long-term success (as opposed to those silly allegations that they were just going to turn around and sell the team again) and that brings me a bit of comfort and makes me optimistic that they will do the right thing this window.",0,1390449942,null,0,false,0,cewkkr8,t3_1vwv6l,t1_cewkkr8,t3_1vwv6l,null,1432065676,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

Backbench MPs wishing to ask a question must enter their names on the Order Paper. The names of entrants are then shuffled in a ballot to produce a random order in which they will be called by the Speaker. The Speaker will then call on MPs to put their questions, usually in an alternating fashion: one MP from the government benches is followed by one from the opposition benches. MPs who are not selected may be chosen to ask a supplementary question if they ""catch the eye"" of the Speaker, which is done by standing and sitting immediately before the prime minister gives an answer.

This seems to be very very far from the stability Dave etc. were all talking about not long ago... I'm really hoping that if he does join in with Sports Capital that they can sort of keep him in check about sacking managers and stuff... He sounds a bit like an Italian Ken Bates or Abramovich with all his sackings. Not quite what I had in mind and I don't know how he'll pass the FL test with prior convictions in embezzlement and fraud....

On a positive note he was trying to bring in Julio Cesar for Cagliari, I think that'd be quite an expensive buy as well as the fact most of the money would be from his own pocket as I assume Cagliari would have a pretty small income (they have stadium troubles allowing them only 5k attendance). And I don't think we'd have to deal with name changes/badge changes of the like of the Cardiff Dragons as he genuinely seems to love football. And apparently he has a good scouting network according to an Italian journo.

He does sound a laugh though:

*Last year he spent several days in prison in Sardinia, accused of fraud for the construction of the Is Arenas stadium, which was later torn down for not having the requisite permits.*

*He is prone to outlandish public statements and can often be seen in the stands chain-smoking while watching Cagliari play.*

*He also inaugurated the opening of the Is Arenas by playing guitar and singing, as he is part of a band in his spare time.*

*Last season Cagliari’s game with Roma was called off by authorities afterCellino urged fans to attend even though it was due to be played behind closed doors, sparking public order fears.*",0,1390452522,null,0,false,0,cewlp7x,t3_1vw30f,t1_cewlp7x,t3_1vw30f,null,1432066133,4,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,4

true,eira64,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"It's rare for a governing party to increase their number of seats without making major changes, such as changing the party leader. If you look at historic results (excluding snap elections), the only modern instance of a prime minister growing their majority is Margaret Thatcher in 1983.

Given the austerity measures this government has passed and limited economic growth it has achieved, it seems pretty unlikely they will buck the trend.

On the other hand, Labour's opposition has been rather weak. Ed Milliband has not gained much traction with the electorate, and is polling much worse than David Cameron. The next election could be a missed opportunity for Labour.

As things stand at the moment it looks like a slim Labour majority or a Lab-Lib coalition is the most likely outcome. Falling unemployment will push the balance in favour of the Conservatives, but I doubt it will be enough.

How could they win? Ending austerity (and risk criticism for doing it in the first place?), change of leadership (who? why would Cameron/Osborne surrender?), meltdown within the Labour party (scandals etc.). None of these seem likely.

The elephant in the room is Scottish independence. The Conservatives so far seem to be opposing it, however without their Scottish MPs it is much harder for Labour to win a majority.

They are six points back, which isn't a lot, and liverpool/everton/spurs all look beatable (lets be honest), but so do United.  

I don't expect Liverpool/Everton/Spurs to all lose enough points on United for them to swoop into fourth.  Even with Mata.

I just don't see it happening.  I've thought United had a weak team for the last couple years (even though they won the title last year, I know).. but they really haven't strengthened and their two best players are injured for god knows how long.

I don't see us getting fourth, but I sure don't see United getting it either.
