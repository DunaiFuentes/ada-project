The economy was being propped up by lies and cheap credit. If you seriously think that the ""austerity"" was unnecessary then you need to actually go read the facts of where our economy went. Frankly its an astounding statement. It worries me greatly that this sort of concept is still floating around.
There are those on the far right that believe the cuts Osborne made didn't go anywhere near far enough. I don't necessarily agree but clearly things did have to be done. These decisions are hard.

Labour have consistently made a mess of the economy, Healey had to call in the IMF because he made such a hash of it.

I would argue that the man in the Â£5m apartment has more choices over their quality of life. 

&gt;Because anyone who looks at inequality measures globally quickly see's that places they'd probably not want to live, have less inequality.

And yet we are talking about the UK. No, wealth equality in and of itself is no indicator of a good life, but we're talking about an increasing wealth gap in the UK.

Considering the 'gap' is reliant on where the 'top' and 'bottom' exist, saying there is a 'gap' in and of itself is meaningless. Of course if we were all getting an increased quality of life, and all getting wealthier then it would be no issue!

But living standards are not increasing.

Maybe it's just fine to have a political system run by those with money and an increasing gap between them, the heads of industry and all the rest of us. 

I have no answers. 

But it seems as if you have nothing to say about the subject either, except of course: The wealth gap is fine, everything is ok, relax, it's all good. Carry on. It's all fine.

The HET runs a budget of ~6 million P/A, for a total spend projected to about 60 to 70 million over its lifetime. In the 8 years to Jan 2013, they had reviewed more than 2,700 of the 3,500 killings from the troubles they were assigned to investigate, at a cost of something more like 20k per case ([Ref](http://www.cjini.org/CJNI/files/8b/8b89d447-fb32-41d7-ae26-57b18509c8a2.pdf)).

We either need a striker who runs towards goal to receive the ball and shoot, or down the channels to force defenders to make quick decisions and put them under pressure which can cause mistakes for others (Lamella, Eriksen, Chadli etc) to exploit.

The trouble is, Ade isn't that type of striker. I think Defoe would have suited Poch better as his instincts suit the style better (not that he's a ""better"" player than Ade overall).

Soldado could be a better fit if he is given the chance, particularly for his attacking mentality and his nice little 1 touch flick ons for other runners. Or maybe Jay Rodriguez would give us the attacking runner we need.

I think *encapsulated* retinol is a pricey ingredient, plus retinol is potentially more irritating than some actives so many companies will shy away from using beneficial percentages.

(Not including sunscreen) seems to me the 'holy trinity' of anti ageing actives is niacinamide (vitamin B3), vitamin C (various forms) and retinoids (vitamin A). These work synergistically with many other actives, from vitamin E to glucosamine through a huge range of plant antioxidants. Thankfully they aren't all pricey, useful amounts of niacinamide and vitamin E are easy to come by for example. And using these all together is how we *should* get the best value out of our retinol product.

There are small skincare companies making products with many actives, so you don't need numerous products as you do with big brand names. It's a shame there are not more UK based ones! Personally I aim not to spend a lot on cleansers, toners and basic moisturisers which frees up a little money for a quality serum.

What do you mean '""defence'"" system? it's an attack system is it? I wish you could remind every British General since the 1950s that because in their ignorance they thought it was HMG's policy to use Nuclear weapons in Defence or at last resort.

By the way, *we* gave most of those ""third world nations"" independence, they didn't decolonize us, which greatly reduced the pressure on the Government to support those nations. Again, the Falklands has clearly shown the need for a strong conventional force too, while the IRA were a stateless, insurgent force. It's largely irrelevant because other countries do have nuclear weapons and would be prepared to use them. The problem is, if you scrap the nuclear deterrent it would be extremely difficult to build them up again. The World has changed a hell of a lot in the last 25 years (Fall of the USSR, Genocide in Kosovo, 9/11. 7/7, Russian invasion of Georgia, Russian invasion of Ukraine, the rise of China as a potential global power) so I don't think its responsible to make policy for the next 25 years let alone 100 years just because people like you want to cut the equivalent of 1.5% of the benefits bill. 

History is littered with examples of politicians and strategists focusing on the last wars, rather than the next wars, it's largely irrelevant if we haven't needed Nuclear weapons in the last 70 years (although I would dispute this). Anyway, its not like you think we should spend that money on our conventional forces instead, you're purely ideological and then trying to justify it by claiming its non-strategic.

He spends too much time supporting the play and not enough time getting into positions to be on the end of things. While admirable that he is trying to add another dimension to his play in the way we see from Sturridge but I think Balotelli would be better served with a strike partner so he can feel less responsibility to make the chance and more to finish them.

Alot of commentators are trying to play up the ""Mad Mario"" bull. Even worse on 5Live the other day, at times Tony Pulis was coming out with what seemed like inadvertent racism/xenophobia with some of his comments. It is the most obvious I have ever seen anybody be about ""the foreigners"" bordering on racism. It was when Balotelli was slapped in the face, Pulis said he was faking then a replay shown he wasn't and Pulis made a rather farcical comment in the way that you'd never get about an English player. It is far more pronounced with the Costas and Balotellis of the game but this underlying xenophobia is rampant and needs to stop.

Seeing as Mario is a completely different striker that Sturridge and Suarez, it't not very surprising that he is taking a tad longer to settle in within our system. It's our system and just that. I have absolutely no doubt in my mind Balo can reach the heights of world class stars, I think he just needs time learning and fitting into Rodger's system. Brendan is now teaching him the fundamentals of his tactics and it's only natural there will be a learning curve. 

He is entirely more lively in his first few games then what I really saw when he was at Milan. He is pressing, showing initiative, and showing his desire more than ever on the ball. I think the fine tuning, like improvised runs, will come eventually. Given sometime I think within 5 games time we will be talking about Mario in a completely different manner. 

We have a ton of new players this season, it's only natural this will effect some of them. Mario is really no different. This system is foreign to other systems he has played.

But my point is it's not fair to say it's 100 times better.  These relationships are not linear, nor log normal.  This is why I dislike these indicators.

&gt; but we're talking about an increasing wealth gap in the UK.

Gotcha, I'm going to skip ahead to the TUC comments, and I'll come back to your other points in a moment.
&gt;For 2013, real household disposable income per capita, described by the TUC as âthe most comprehensive measure of living standardsâ, was 2.6% below its peak according to the latest data. It was Â£16,881 in 2013 down from a peak of Â£17,324 in 2007. On the previous figures, the measure had been 1.8% off the peak, standing at Â£15,764 in 2013 down from a peak of Â£16,060 hit in 2009.

The wealth gap in 2006/7 would be higher than it is today.  The main reason for this is the liquidity crisis created a huge downward pressure on the price of many assets.  Poor people, didn't have huge amounts of money invested to loose.  As the recession started, the gap between the rich and the poor was lower.

You might even find wealth inequality **inversely correlated** to employment and real household disposable income per capita!  Just have to play with your date ranges.

&gt;Of course if we were all getting an increased quality of life, and all getting wealthier then it would be no issue!

Which is why I prefer other measures!  For instance if we took just disposable income, we must of course view it in real terms, otherwise rampant inflation would make us look better off rather than worse.

&gt;But living standards are not increasing.

I agree.

&gt;I apologise for using an 'angry left' source for this, what with it being the Guardian AND TUC.

I spent 3 years writing software for running numbers providing as close to real time analysis of patterns between certain indicators and countries, global macro, arbitrage, etc.  So please understand, I can't fucking stand the Guardian, the Mail, The Telegraph, The... Well you get the idea.  I've come to the conclusion that being enumerate is a requirement for journalism.

&gt;But it seems as if you have nothing to say about the subject either, except of course: The wealth gap is fine, everything is ok, relax, it's all good. Carry on. It's all fine.

Again that's not what I'm saying at all.  I remember running simulations back in 2006 that looked at possibilities for what would happen with regards to the US housing market problem.  We were trying to do cross correlation models, [these are expensive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem) I made some good little simulations, that turned out to be rather wrong in the end.  I got the effects of the crash correct, but too conservative.  The fall out turned out to be worse than we were predicting.  Sure the people I was working for made a shit load of money, one even bought a yacht so big it... I digress.  I look at numbers, that's what my brain is good at, not as it turned out negotiating.  But anyway, I look at our housing market.  I look at our simple measures and I just think wow.  We've got a pickle.  We either have to massively build more houses, to bring about a correction, implement population control, or similar, but do it too aggressively and we could see our own financial crisis.

Too many swing voters don't want to see house prices stagnate, or even just deflate purely in real terms, so our governments won't let them.  We've got rates so low, that people are renting at a sub 3% yeild in many parts of London, yet the owners are expecting a rise in the asset.  Correcting this is going to be messy.

People are spending a huge proportion of income on accommodation, I have friends, a couple who one half of wishes to break up, but can't due to rental cost fears.  That to me is a great poverty indicator, those trapped in a relationship because they don't have a choice (oooh, now I want to rant about divorces being an indicator of a good style of life).

There are many things to be concerned about, so much that the government just isn't doing because *those fuckers vote* such as Pension Issues, I could rant about those all day.

His intelligence is certainly his biggest asset, which is the main point of the article, so fair enough. But he is a very technically accomplished player. His first touch is arguably the best at the club. He is two-footed and good at passing / crossing. He isn't quick or agile, but his top speed is decent. He takes a good free kick and has a wonderful curling shot. 

I think his biggest issues are his lack of acceleration, his lack of aggression, his propensity to carry niggling injuries, and a lack of composure in scoring situations. This season he seems to be rectifying the latter, so it bodes well.

I think he's a really weird player. He's elegant, physical, and pragmatic. If he just had that little bit of quickness off the blocks he would be something pretty special, but he takes a while to get going so he can't really get away from players. It forces him to rely on his positioning.

No one said that.

To be fair, I am not going to proclaim to be an expert with the statistics. I am happy to yield the point that income equality in and of itself is useless.

Clearly we've gotten stuck on a single issue, where really I think we're basically in agreement on the basics. To return to the original comment with which I took satirical issue:

""Wage growth has been weak but it will start of pick up now. They've repaired the economy far better than anyone expected.""

Maybe this statement is accurate, but what it is above all else is apologetics for the continued Tory policies that put a squeeze on the lower end to the benefit of the top end. My point was not 'wealth inequality', but rather to point out that Tory policies are merely going to improve things for those with, while those with less will do worse. 

The economy may or may not be 'better', but to whose benefit have the rewards largely gone?

To be fair you seem a smart, well informed fellow, and I am happy to say you are no doubt right on wealth inequality as being a poor yard-stick of poverty.

But the largest part of my frustration is reserved for those who proclaim that there is no specific problem with the system. When confronted with the issues they obfuscate and deflect. Sure, perhaps wealth inequality in and of itself is not a good judge, but as you say the effects of poverty are real. 

Those who have are at a greater advantage to turn their lives around and ride the waves of an unpredictable economy. Those without are in trouble and have a harder time recovering.

Those with a Â£5m have resources that those in Â£50k houses do not. 

We're going to head to an automation society. Unskilled jobs are going to be wiped out in vast swathes. When we have a large percentage of the workplace as unskilled, what will those people do?

My concern is not with 'punishing' those doing well. I do not believe there needs to be an 'upper limit' on success. 

My concern is with those at the bottom and the opportunities society gives to draw oneself up from it. My concern is that those opportunities are withdrawing, that resources are being monopolised by fewer and fewer and that those with the ability to change it are those best served by it.

false,kittysaysmeownow,null,null," I think your opinion is a valid one, based in the idea of ""if we start telling them how to dress, it makes us just as bad as they are"" sort of thing.

I think that's a lovely ideal, and I wish I too could see it that simply, but unfortunately, I'm a realist. Lines have to be drawn somewhere. If you want to be super politically correct, you must allow all religions to practice. So what if it's someone's religion to commit murder? Or someone's religion to commit peadophilia? It would be against our western values, after all, to stop them from practicing their religion.... 

Do we draw the line at affecting others? How? Is 'offending' someone enough to draw a line on? No? What about frightening someone? Maybe not? Ok, so let's make it this way: you can do what you want to yourself, as long as you don't harm others. Well, here the trouble starts. What's harming others? Is oppressing someone really harming them? What if it's your own child or family member? Can you harm them? No, of course not.  But can you oppress them? And here the trouble begins.

The trouble is that this isn't so black and white. To what extent should we condone oppression in the name of religion? To what extent should we condone segregation? Should we give special exemption to religious groups to oppress or to segregate their own followers? 

It is my humble opinion that we should not. As I responded to another comment on this post, I will respond the same here. There's a fine line between freedom of religion and the freedom of a religion to *oppress*; I personally believe that burkas are on that line, and we as a western society should not allow oppression, even when it's in the name of religion.

This leaves a nation where some things, like elective medical care (fully functional prosthetic limbs, simple cures for some kinds of cancer, bio-neural interfaces) can be bought by the rich and middle classes, as profitable technologies receive, like today, large amounts of investment and development. But the changes in climate and limits on resources also mean that some things we take for granted, like running water as a basic essential in every home, are harder to provide than internet access for everyone.

He's worked hard for the team and kept the petulance to a minimum, so for that aspect he gets a thumbs up.

That said, he's very much a luxury player. He's someone who we can (hopefully) get pieces of magic from on occasion, but he's not the type of player a team can *rely* on. So far that magic hasn't really shown itself, so we're not getting too much from him at the minute. I think it was really unfortunate that Sturridge got injured so early into Balotelli's career with us. Mario obviously doesn't suit being a lone striker or the primary goalscorer.

The whole team is playing poorly, so it's hard to judge players individually, especially new ones. He obviously has talent, and his attitude so far has been good, so I'm cautiously optimistic about him. However, I'm also concerned that this may be the honeymoon period, and the lazy sulker will rear his head later on.",0,1412104447,null,0,false,0,ckwrlin,t3_2hwsrb,t1_ckwrlin,t3_2hwsrb,null,1426749278,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

Sorry, I'm implying that from use of income inequality measures, this is even more unfair of me to do so, as these are normally log normal.

&gt;Maybe this statement is accurate, but what it is above all else is apologetics for the continued Tory policies that put a squeeze on the lower end to the benefit of the top end. My point was not 'wealth inequality', but rather to point out that Tory policies are merely going to improve things for those with, while those with less will do worse.

This is part of the issue, I'm a numbers kind of guy, I like them, the only agenda they have is how you frame them, themselves, they are just show you what things are.  This is why I'm glad the Tories were able to get a coalition.  On the news of them winning, our debt cost dropped.  That means suddenly the government had more money (or rather would run up a slightly less deficit).  That is just the way the numbers are.  Owen Jones can write about how sad this is, but its the reality.  We need people to lend our country money, people are happier to do that without Labour running the show.

That in itself would be a benefit to those who pay tax and to those who use state assistance, so that's all of us then.

What it comes down to, and why I dislike focusing on wealth inequality, is the only way we can improve the quality of live is by efficiency improvements.  We could try and transfer wealth, but how would it really work.  Someone is still going to have the house in Hampstead whilst someone else has to live in Tower Hamlets.  The only things that can bring genuine life improvements is by having gains in efficiency.

A classic example would be food production in Vietnam.  It was awful in the 80s, people were starving, food had to be imported, but then things were relaxed, farmers could profit from their operation, wealth inequality rose, but so did efficiency.  There was now an incentive for people to really have more efficient irrigation, to grow plants that better yielded their climate (trade Coffee (expensive) for Rice/Wheat (cheap!)).  If you want to improve things, efficiency is the real way forward, inequality is a physical limitation (geographic space, beauty of sexual partners even).

&gt;Unskilled jobs are going to be wiped out in vast swathes. When we have a large percentage of the workplace as unskilled, what will those people do?

I honestly don't know, we have a culture that is prevalent that doesn't value education.  Compared with so many developed and developing countries (USA asside) this worries me.  I have a string of anecdotes that demonstrate the differences, if I had to bet on a generation, I sure as hell wouldn't be betting on the UK one, compared to many of those being educated in say HK or Singapore or even Saigon.  The attitude of the student is so vastly different, being ignorant is a shameful thing, not learning is a shameful act of waste, in the UK sadly it's to be relished.  You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make them think.  I do not think we are some how genetically incapable, nor do I think its diet or some other excuse, I found mentoring, one on one, even the more challenging case would learn and enjoy doing so.  We just have huge segments that feel disenfranchised.

&gt;My concern is with those at the bottom and the opportunities society gives to draw oneself up from it. My concern is that those opportunities are withdrawing, that resources are being monopolised by fewer and fewer and that those with the ability to change it are those best served by it.

I think this is going to happen more and more, I honestly think there is no, long term solution for it that doesn't make me shudder (conflict, eugenics etc), we will become a meritocratic society, split between those who are productive and useful, those who are not.

However, in the short term context of this global recession, we have actually done rather well compared to others.  I only hope we don't continue to inflate our housing market and create our own 'fear of default' crisis.  Which is what the credit crunch should be thought of as imnsho.  It brings home the importance of not borrowing money for short term issues.  Crude as it is, borrowing money to spend on the care of someone who is going to help growth or repayment is not sustainable.  I say that's crude because the upshot is we can't spend massive amounts on defined benefit pensions, healthcare and the like, instead it condemns the next generation to having to carry an increasing burden.  To me, it's an optimisation problem, the same way we don't spend billions upgrading the tube, so disabled people can use it better.  It's not value for money, that money can do more good elsewhere.

That to me is why the Tories actually deserve some credit.  Things like capping housing benefit, whilst cruel in a way, strike me as the least worst option out there.  Assuming building on the green belt / population controls are out.  I just wish they had balls and would tackle issues like defined benefit pensions for state employees.",0,1412104985,null,0,false,0,ckwrw65,t3_2htveu,t1_ckwrw65,t1_ckwr4qf,null,1426749139,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I got my first full time job using a recruitment agency. Try searching and applying for jobs on reedglobal. Recruitment agents will get back to you, and arrange interviews for you, if they think you fit the role. Remember, the company looking for new hires is paying them, so agencies may not have your best interests at heart, but they want to fill a role and if you gotta get a job you gotta get a job.


Family friends. Yeah, networking. It's balls but its how you play the game. I dont mean go and schmooze people, just ask folks to send out emails on your behalf, stuff like ""could you talk to Outlook Fair for ten minutes on your lunch break, he/she's searching for a direction and would love to know a bit about your field an how you found your job calling etc"". You never know, they may spend ten minutes complaining or they may show you new routes to carrying on the job search.


If, like me, you ended up spending 4 hours a day applying for jobs on the computer, for the love of god take up a hobby. I started running because my self esteem and patience was just crippled from rejection after rejection. It took me 3 months that felt so, so long, lonely and unproductive.


If you're not desperate for money, work for fucking free. I don't know what field you're interested in but go and find emails tucked in the back corner of websites that are in the field you want to work in, e.g. ""Manchester magazines"", and send out prospective 'internship/work exp' emails that are almost a cover letter but not quite.


When using reed/indeed/other job sites, and you find a job you want, always try and find the company website and apply through them, instead of applying through a job website. Always, as much as possible, do this. 


You will find that your standards drop as unemployment stretches out like a desert before you. Thats ok. i only wish that people celebrated their victories as much as they berate themselves for their failures. You will be rejected. Many times. It's ok. You will find a job. 


Job says ""two years exp""? Fucking just apply anyway. Worst case: they turn you down, and you're in the same spot as if you didn't apply anyway. Just be prepared to bullshit. The two years exp thing is a trick to send the little fishes scurrying away, in about 6 out of 10 adverts. Obviously if it's 2 years of accounting exp don't be stupid and apply. I'm talking about office work, e.g.


Interviews: have 5 'power stories' about how great you are (in the format of Situation, Task, Action, Response [STAR]) to illustrate all those buzzwords, teamwork, communication, etc. Talk about the company. All the time. Don't stop. Have at least 4 company relate questions to ask at the end. Know some kind of factoid about them? Say it mid answer like you're on QI or something and think you have a witty wrong answer instead of the right, boring answer.


Don't be upset when you get rejected, especially past interview stage. There was someone better than you for the job. That's it. Nothing else.


Its a slog, an its hard, and you might end up in a job that sucks but thats  cool, man. Remember that to bosses you are a disposable piece of labour right now, and here's the upside to that: you owe no obligations to anyone. You can ditch them as fast, even faster, as they can ditch you. If a place is serious about you, they'll give you proper training. It costs time and money to train someone. They are investing in you.


Places that will always hire you - Starbucks. Livable wage? Just about. 20 to 25 year old coworkers always up for a booze-up? Yup.


Personally, i think printing out ten CVs and going into the big city to hand them out in stores was a waste of my time. Others might say different. One last thing - the bigger the company, the more people desperate to take your place, the more you are a fleshy work-sack to them. I have friends at Man United, at Rent-a-car, on graduate schemes in hotels, who say that they are forced to do unpaid overtime, who have to take their work home with them on weekends, who found they weren't so much a trainee manager than just extra hotel barstaff.

He was very committed to the bible. Not in a preachy way, but genuinely took it at very face value - the word of god was in his eyes perfect, 100% perfect. If we had a discussion about say abortion he approached it brilliantly, and was very patient with others who more often than not got angry and shouty. He never did....And I respected him for that.

No sex, and he had no girlfriend at college (4 years!). From what I could gather he simply avoided the issue of relationships at college. Probably because none of the girls where JW, and I know this would be a problem with his church.

He was very wholesome - I know that sounds kinda strange, but he was in his own way a lovely friendly guy....to the right people, but not everyone....

I could tell he was suspicion of other people. He was a times a little racist (he was white African, I don't know if that had anything to-do with it). And some people he seemed to almost look down at. It wasn't obvious, but I spend enough time with him to pick slight undertones.

Past that my experience is limited. I of course relish the challenge of a conversation when they knock on my door. Iv always been quite interested in religion and JWs are more than happy to have a chat.

Spent just under a year applying for jobs and graduate schemes, most within the Automotive, Oil &amp; Gas, Renewable Energy, Subsea, Petrochemical &amp; Process Industries (There is overlap between some of those).

Over 300 job applications and 19 interviews later, I finally got my first job offer, for a Graduate Design Engineer position. I accepted immediately. Pretty decent pay too.

What industry are you looking to get into? My general advice for any would be to research companies in the area (Type keywords into google maps and see what you find, search for local business directories and cluster organisations etc.), then send speculative applications to them. Follow them up with a phone call a few days later. If you're close enough, go and hand you CV/Cover letter in in person.

If you lack experience, the best thing to do is to try and find a company that will take you on and train you up. This is easier said than done, so you may have to bite the bullet and ask companies if they would be willing to take you on for free for a few weeks (Assuming you are be unemployed, you can get support from the job centre during this time, providing you inform them in advance). This will give you some experience, some industry contacts and something to go on your CV. (I'm not talking about minimum wage jobs, you should never do those for free, they're low paid for a reason - they don't require a lot of skill to do so you won't really benefit).

Apprenticeships are also a good route to gain some practical experience and learn a trade. Again I'm not talking about the signs you see for a 'Sandwich artist apprentice' at subway, I'm talking about actual skilled jobs which can increase your chances of employment in the future (Engineering is always a good option, but I hear IT can be good to go into as well). The pay is crap to start with but you come out of one with a lot of experience and best of all, no student loan debt. I would not advise one of these if you already have a degree; you're selling yourself short if you do.

&gt;The attitude of the student is so vastly different, being ignorant is a shameful thing, not learning is a shameful act of waste, in the UK sadly it's to be relished.

Not for all. There are plenty who want to get ahead and have a good education. 

Perhaps Â£9k a year tuition fees makes good sense in financial terms. Perhaps the majority will gain financial aid, or their debts will be managable past uni. 

But Â£9k a year sure does a lot to put people off university who might not have had the encouragement from their own parents to do better.

Maybe, as you say, 'you can lead a horse to water'. Maybe people should be more responsible for their own fate. 

The problem for me is one of opportunities. Resources. Those with parents who have more are not only more capable of directing their own fate, with a safety net and support, but also benefit from the intangible confidence of expectations. Their parents have the experience and knowledge of what it is to gain success - and perhaps gained it from their own parents.

Ukip and the Tories are both planning to make inheritance tax either easier on the 'user' or scrap it all together. Those with more will be able to pass on more. 

Now, maybe that's fine. But maybe it's simply another move that benefits those 'with'. Meanwhile, those with less are seeing a squeese.

I don't know the answers. Maybe it's best that we have large amounts of people stay poor for the benefit of the majority. Maybe a growing and stagnated underclass will make most sense to the financials of the country as a whole.

Any chance a few of the kind redditors of this sub could answer the three questions in this survey? It's about youth crime. The module that I'm studying at the Open University requires that I conduct a very brief survey to investigate popular opinion on the subject.

Thank-you for your thoughts. 

Edit: **Thanks to the 30 kind folks who took the survey for me.** The main purpose of it was to look at whether people lean towards Classicism or Positivism as a way of talking about crime. The largest group of people appeared to believe in both in equal measure. Beyond that, there were equal numbers who *strongly* supported each outlook. In the middle of the scale, there were more ""slightly Positivist""s than Classicists, implying that Classicism can evoke stronger feelings of agree/disagree. 

The question 1 results also showed a mixed result. Some responses contained systemic causes, but also the caveat that individuals are most to blame. This mirrors the Q2/3 finding that most people believe equally in both outlooks.

I'll tell you a story now, when I was a young lad of 6 I went with my old nan to Norwich.

Well it was a nice day and we sat in the car park and I spotted a huge van nearby with ""Zaks Diner"" on the side 

I said to my old nan ""I'm just going to pop in there and see what they got""

She nodded so I strolled across, well I only had 50p on me (this was 1978) and I saw on the menu ""fries 26p""

I'd never heard of that before so I said to Zak ""a portion of these here fries cheers""

He grinned and put a load of skinny chips into a carton and said ""salt and vinegar young sir?""

I nodded so I took the carton back to the car and wolfed em down.

It's just capitalism, and Sainsbury's are no more guilty than anyone else.

I remember working for MVC in the 90s, and it's this attitude that destroyed the company imo.  We went from a friendly, well informed store where customers could come to ask about new music and get opinions and recommendations to 'get the fuck behind the till, stop wasting time on stupid ' giving a fuck about the customers' timewasting , and while you're there, you need to sell every customer a shitty dvd for Â£3 on top of what they're buying.'

Oh and instead of music being chosen by staff, a shitty corporate playlist.  Meaning we had to listen to James Blunt or S Club 7 eleventy times a fucking day.

false,agentdcf,flair8,,"One thing that struck me about the match against Arsenal was that when we would break upfield on a counter, our players often had acres of space ahead of them--but they often looked uncomfortable. We wasteful in possession, often missing an open man streaking up one side. It was as though our players had spent so much time playing in a slower, more conservative, possession-based system that they'd forgotten what wide open space *looked like*, and what they should do with it when they saw it. 

And yet, to be successful, Pochetino needs them to be able to seize on the gaps created by a quick transition game, to learn to almost instinctively punch the ball forward and run into space. I hope this was a good experience for them, and I suspect it was. We seemed to look a lot more comfortable on the break as time went on, as though they realized (remembered?) how fun it is to catch another team unprepared and to run pell mell for goal. 

And, like I said, it'll be really interesting to see when and against whom Pochetino deploys this strategy again. With the example of the Liverpool game in mind, it's not a given that we'll sit deep against stronger sides. Surely we'll see it away to City on the 18th, but I wonder if he'll try to be more aggressive against a bigger team when we're at WHL.

However on the converse side the nationalist/republican aims were more complex and while the 'end-game' aim of a united ireland is arguably no further on, we have power sharing, an end to unionist domination and equality for nationalist/catholic peoples.

2) Not universally adopted by British citizens, and certainly not among the more ""traditional"" older generations, who are more likely to hold homophobic or xenophobic views, for example. 

I mean, traditionally, Britain has a habit of oppressing and exploiting people from all across the world, including British people. The idea that liberal values are a British idea is a fallacy. The whole ""British values"" spiel is just patriotic ego wanking and doesn't actually mean anything.

This is part of what makes me think that one of the consequences of the Time Lock on the time war is not simply to prevent anyone from getting ""in"" or ""out"" of those timelines, but also means that the Doctor is now travelling in a ""new"", post-war version of the universe, in which any contact with the pre-time war version in normally impossible.

As well as your point about meeting other time lords, is it notable that the Doctor in NuWho has met several races and individuals who have knowledge of the time lords - but only in the past tense: they know that they were around but they are not now.  

Conversely, in Classic Who, he met several races and individuals who knew of the time lords, but none who know them to be gone, or have any knowledge of the time war.  

I think that it would be impossible - under normal circumstances - for the post time war Doctor to meet anyone who who does know of the time lords as still existing. However, there have been a few exceptions to this:

1. The Day of the Doctor - in which Ten and Eleven met War, which seems to have been caused by the Moment, circumventing the time lock, possibly because it was the Moment itself that caused the time lock.  

2. Timecrash - in which Ten meets Five, and - unusually for a multi-Doctor meeting seems to recall the event from his younger version (Ten knew what to do, because he remembered it from when he was Five). I believe that this was only possible because it was a fixed point in time - a point that he had already witnessed *and remembered* as Five, and so *had* to happen.  

3. The visit to the barn in *Listen*, which I am inclined to believe was also a fixed point in time, and so also had to happen, and so was able to bypass the timelock.

However, rather than the entire series of timelines that occurred up to the end of the time war being out-of-reach as a direct consequence of the time lock, and the time lock being a single dividing line or barrier, my current view is that the time lock itself is effectively like a chasm containing the time war timelines, and making escape impossible, but, as a side effect also preventing movement from one side to another.  

However, when it comes down to it, I really do think that any view that one forms about this simply acts to straighten out some apparent paradoxes only by creating others else, perhaps a little less noticeable.

If you sprawl outwards, then public transport becomes less viable as places of employment, services and residency no longer exist in central locations. People then rely more and more on private automobile traffic, which compounds issues such as chronic sedentary lifestyles, air pollution, anchor-less communities and subtle things like food deserts.

Economic opportunity costs spiral out of control as the activation price of remaining in employment is tied to how much personal time you're prepared to spend in bumper-to-bumper traffic, the cost of imported energy and the running costs of motorised vehicles.

I could write War and Peace about the hells of unchecked suburban sprawl, but my general sentiment is that if you're prepared to throw everything away for the short term relief of sprawling outwards then you've created a country and society not worth living in.

The process has been started, and will be unstoppable unless/until Labour win the next election and repeal the health and social care bill. It's put choosing the lowest bidder and competition ahead of collaboration and providing quality care. I fully believe the NHS will degrade into nothing more than a disjointed group of private providers using the NHS ""brand"" unless the process that the coalition has started with this bill is reversed. And it's already started having some [noticable effects](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/late-diagnosis-of-hiv-blamed-on-coalitions-health-reforms-9760086.html) on patient care. This doesn't mean it won't remain taxpayer funded and free at the point of use for the time being, although the Tories have made it clear they would like start charging patients upfront too. So this is what I meant by the privatisation of the NHS, it's an ongoing process rather than something that has been done in an instant.

&gt;Increase the income tax threshold.

Yeah this has been good, somewhat makes up for the benefits cuts to low earners.

&gt;Free school dinners.

Also good, somewhat makes up for the increase in child poverty and families needing to rely on food banks.

&gt;Limiting political donations.

Did this ever actually get implemented? Must have missed that.

I've seen several comments along the lines of Balo doesn't fit our system and he doesn't make the runs Suarez used to make and so on and so forth.

Obviously Mario isn't Luis, they are different players and they have a different skillset. Last year was Luis' 4th with Liverpool and his 2nd under BR. Mario has just come in at Liverpool and will need time to adapt to the team, but the team will have to get used to playing with him as well. I think it's a bit unreasonable to expect him to deliver the same types of performances Suarez had last year.

Granted, I think we were all hoping for a better start from him, but I think the same can be said for the whole team's play as well. In the first few games, the players barely managed to get the ball forward and the ball rarely ever went up to him. Based on the performance against Everton, I think that's improved a lot. He might not be as dynamic as Suarez was but he has his own strengths that I think will benefit the team in the long run.

Furthermore, I think he should benefit greatly from playing with Sturridge. A lot of people have complained that he's tracked back too much and it leaves the box area empty at times when the team is counter attacking. I think with Sturridge in, that tracking will be very useful and he can possibly alternate this role a bit fluidly with Daniel to ensure that one of them remains an attacking threat if the other tracks back.

Moreover, given that he's been our sole real attacking option in a few of the games we've had, it's probably easier for opposing defenders to mark him. It's also important to note that we've had a number of new additions in midfield as well that still have to adjust to their roles and linking up with the forwards. Once the team has more time to gel then I expect better things. I'm with Rodgers when he says to wait until Christmas before making any judgements.

false,PeeMart,null,null,"Yo,

First post.  Been lurking here for awhile.  Big City Fan.  Here is my take--

We need to change our formation.  We get bossed around in the midfield, especially with Yaya who, as I have been saying for the past two seasons, is a liability with his lack of pressing.  It is easy to pick on him as it is obvious that he can be rather languid and lazy on the field, but what really kills us his is lack of pressing.  Fernandinho can't do it all.  Yaya is a very strange player-- it is hard to find out where to play the guy, as he lacks the discipline and pressing ability to play a defensive midfield position, and he is no longer a box-to-box midfielder, as he sort of just trots around the pitch a lot of the time.  Perhaps playing behind the striker alongside Silva would be a better spot for him.  Or perhaps the bench...

Why we play with two forwards is beyond me.  Was clear today and has been clear for a while that when we switch to a 4-2-3-1 we are much more potent in attack, and the extra man in midfield allows us to push forward and maintain possession, as opposed to constantly chasing around the opposition.

I'd love to see us play with a 4-2-3-1 more often-- especially with the fact that we only have three strikers in the squad, and two of which are rather injury prone.  I do like Dzeko, I think he is a good player, but there are times when he is simply just not needed out there.  Today was one of them.

After sixth form (English, French and psychology) I joined the merchant navy as a deck cadet and stayed for about 15 months - September 2012 to December 2013. It was such a lonely life, I didn't think I could hack it for much longer. While my main skill is maneuvering large maritime vessels, which there isn't much call for in Leeds, it did give me a lot of experience in things like communication, teamwork, planning and problem solving, etc, which I hope gives me something to stand on. Ever since then I've been looking for an apprenticeship, but I haven't had any interviews since spring now and I'm starting to feel a persistent low level panic. 

I've signed up to some recruiting companies and hopefully I'll have an appointment this week. In the meantime I'm researching to see if my shipping experience could help me with something in the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, or similar. I think I'm good at interviews; if you sound confident, people will assume you are. 

I work as a kitchen porter at the moment, which is a bit grim. My friends are far away and it's lonely sometimes but I keep myself busy. I planted some pumpkin squashes which I'm disproportionately excited about making into soup! Vegetable friends!

If bayern win both their games then we are in a much much better position, with 6 opposed to roma's 4. If Bayern win one and draw one then roma will be left with 5 points to citys 6. If bayern win one and lose one then i'd say quite strongly it is out of reach based on the way city have performed this and past seasons. Coming back to the first situation where bayern win both their games leaving roma with 4, it is likely roma will beat cska in their following game to push them up to 7 points which i think city (at best) can match by drawing at home to bayern.

Let me guess, you read the Telegraph.

I have paid in an utter shit-ton of tax into the system in the 9 years I've been of working age. I've been made redundant and got myself back on my feet no thanks to Osborne's ""miracle recovery"". I am teetotal. I claim a minimal amount of working tax credit to top up my earnings to something livable.

And according to you I lead some lavish lifestyle of luxury spending my sponged welfare payments on booze and drugs amirite? Despite the fact I have paid a good ten times more INTO the system than I've taken out?

And answer me this. If it's money we ""don't have"", then why in the name of holy fucking shitballs are we sending a good few billion quid worth of weaponry into Iraq and Syria!?!

Moreover, I actually think Fazio and Chiriches will complement each other really well and will be a very effective pairing, especially for the Europa League:

* Regarding the Europa League, Vlad played very well in the competition last year, and I think Vlad may be better-suited to playing continental teams.  This concerns me in terms of the PL, but it makes him a great choice for the EL generally.  And of course, Fazio has pretty much made Europe League his bitch in recent years.

* Vlad is right-footed and (if I recall correctly) has put in his best performances as a RCB.  Fazio, on the other hand, usually played LCB for Sevilla.  So both players can play on their more comfortable and familiar side.

* Vlad is our most marauding CB, while Fazio is our most stay-at-home CB.  With Kaboul/Vert, both players occasionally have an eye for a forward run, so they really have to communicate well.  With Vlad and Fazio, there's no question about who is staying back, and Vlad's offensive contributions (which can be quite useful) will be backstopped by Fazio's solidity and positioning.

* Fazio probably has the weakest ball skills out of all our CBs, but Vlad makes up for this by being probably our most skilled CB with the ball at his feet.

* Vlad is our weakest CB in the air, and Fazio might well be our strongest.

It seems like a general malaise has descended upon fans and players alike, and the media doesn't seem very excited about City either. The big narrative is Chelsea domination and United rebuilding, no one's interested in us, and if I'm being frank, it seems like we're not all that excited about us either. The attitude around here and elsewhere after recent match days honestly reminds me of reading about City in the 80s.

I almost hesitate to even suggest it, but part of me is afraid it's a result of Pellegrini's much applauded calmness. I'm glad to have a manager who isn't a bitch like Mourinho or Wenger, but what if the calming influence he's said to have on the team is also the cause of their apparent lack of drive? What if his hesitance to mix it up in the media doesn't get fans hyped up as much as other managers personas?

&gt;Moreover after five cheerless years in power I suspect voters want to hear some good news at last. They want to be reminded why they liked Cameron in the first place; god knows they need to be reminded of that. Instead, this conference has taken a different path. Far from slaying negative stereotypes about the Tories it has reinforced them. Only the Nasty Party bores on about welfare cards.

&gt;It is one thing to accept the need for further and faster and deeper cuts in public spending; it is quite another to boast that youâre so much tougher than your rivals. This might, in Westminster parlance, establish your credibility; it also fosters the suspicion that youâre happy to divide the country into camps labelled deserving and undeserving. There is a relish to Tory rhetoric on public spending that is unattractive. It hints at a small-tent conservatism that knows who belongs inside and to hell with anyone who lacks the fortune to be a member.

&gt;Yes, fortune. Freezing tax credits might be defensible; freezing tax credits while also opposing Labourâs proposed tax on houses worth more than Â£2m is a very different thing indeed. Doing so when youâve already cut the rate of income tax paid by the richest 3% of Britons compounds the folly.

I am simply highlighting the yearly witch-hunt that springs up around Gerrard and the circuital response the captain has produced. 

Stating that this is a ""load of shit"" it a tad ignorant. This post is to point out that Rodgers' tactics (which would include team personal) as well as Gerrard's upturn in form have resulted in the team playing better. The reason why I highlight Gerrard is because he is undoubtedly one of our better players, so his rise in form would logically make the team better (which it has in the last two seasons). 

Also, I do touch on the fact that the team needs to learn and begin playing well with each other, which is obviously effecting Gerrard, but more importantly, the teams form. 

Furthermore, it seems that Rodgers ""tactically"" used Gerrard to ""become effective again"" with his goal this past weekend against Everton. It's easy to play the ""what if"" game but this weekend proved that he is still a match winner for the team.

Again, I do believe that we need to phase Gerrard out, but for now (and in the past 2 years) I still believe he is a valuable asset to team.

It's difficult to answer specific questions about a personal statement as I don't know what's motivating you to study chemistry and what you're hoping to get out of your degree. You've already outlined the key points you should raise in the PS (i.e. ""why chemistry?"" ""previous experience working in chemistry"" ""what do I want to use my BSc for?""). If you can answer those questions passionately and with conviction, you're definitely on the right track. Given that you haven't got experience working in chemistry, it'll be difficult but you can still outline possible work experience placements and industrial training that you hope to undertake in the future.

&gt;Further, if The Doctor is visiting a planet or something from before the Time War, there should be lots of other Time Lords buzzing about in that particular time era.   

I don't think you're fully appreciating how big *all of space and time* is. [This is the intro to the movie *Contact*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWwhQB3TKXA), to give people an idea of how small one planet around one star in one galaxy out of millions in the universe is. That's just *space*. Now multiply that by the vastness of time, every second that ever was and will ever be. That's the range of a Tardis.

When Gallifrey fell, the Tenth Doctor said that there were 2.47 billion children on the planet. The Earth currently has a population of around 2 billion children out of our total of about 7 billion. Let's discount casualties and assume that Gallifrey has roughly the same population proportions. This gives us about 8.75 billion total Gallifreyans but hell, let's round it to 9 because whole numbers are easier to work with. 

Now let's assume every one of them pre-fall had a Tardis and each traveled to a separate location in the universe. Let's also assume every single one of them are as adventurous as the Doctor: As of the end of series 8, the show will have ran 252 stories, or 252 adventures, so Let's say every one of those Gallifreyans have been on just as many. That means that 2,268,000,000,000 spots in the universe have been spoken for.

To contrast: Astronomers estimate that there are 100,000,000,000 stars in the milky way (our galaxy). Let's assume that every galaxy is homogeneous and has the same number of stars as ours: Currently there are an estimated 100 billion (100,000,000,000) galaxies that have been observed.  *That's at least 100 billion times 100 billion stars*, times however many planets there are out there. 2,268 billion is *nothing* compared to how many potential landing spots there are out there. 

Each Gallifreyan would be hard pressed to accidentally run into another in just space, not even taking into account time. There seem to have been vastly fewer actual Time Lords than total Gallifreyans, which makes the likelihood of them running into each other astronomically small.

I would err on hesitating than making a major mistake.

Be calm and observant. If you're coming up to traffic lights, check if there are people waiting, if they are cover your brakes.

At roundabouts look at wheels as well as their signal to see were they intend to go. Not everyone remembers to MSM!

Make sure you read the signs! You need to use the bus lane when appropiate.

Make sure you read the lane instructions! If your lane tells you to turn left and you're supposed to go straight GO LEFT. You won't fail because of that.

Good luck I passed first time with 3 minors 2 weeks ago! One for hesitating, one for poor control on reverse around corner (turned too late so ended up near the centre), and one for leaving my signal on after I lane changed - Got asked to go straight ahead at roundabout, was travelling in right hand lane because of parked cars on left.

I did contact the car company who gave a load of old shit via email and letter but the card company just refunded the money without any further hassle once I sent them the evidence and outlined what had happened.

Underwriters like people who appear low-risk (for all the talk here about whether or not you are a profitable customer, in the real world application decisioning is almost entirely focused on how risky you are). Our imaginary risk model probably says something like:

- People with more available credit are lower risk (since the lower-risk you are, the more credit you get offered. Circular, but true)
- People who don't use their available credit are lower risk (suggests your cashflow is stable and you've got more money coming in than going out)
- People with more 'good' (active, not in default) accounts are lower risk (perhaps up to a point; lots and lots of accounts might be bad)

All good so far, so why worry? In the other thread, /u/gazofnaz rightly suggests that it might be concerning if our applicant could quickly ramp up debt levels to an unsustainable level. An underwriter may therefore take available credit into account as part of an affordability check or as part of their lending policies. This is likely to be based on a ratio of the applicant's income.

In conclusion, have a few active credit products with a large amount of available credit that you aren't using, but try and keep your available credit to reasonable levels.

That's just the thing, though. I think Moffat was quite deliberately trying to transform the conception of a companion over the course of Amy Pond's time on the show.  He is rejecting some of the traditional narratives of adventure stories, where young people with few responsibilities could go on adventures and do amazing things, but eventually had to quit their lives of world-saving in order to settle down and live a proper adult life, or where the hero has to lie to their loved ones a lead a double life in order to protect them, or out of fear of rejection (this last one was addressed in the Caretaker). Of course, Davies/Gardner laid the groundwork by giving the companions families outside the TARDIS, which in itself was major change from the classic series. But Moffat is really trying to push the boundaries of what a companion can be, showing that being a mother doesn't stop you from fighting alien invasions (although it helps if your daughter is a time traveller who occasionally drops in from the future to help you do it), and having a career doesn't mean you can't do great things in your spare time.",0,1412117230,null,0,false,0,ckwy648,t3_2hvsw8,t1_ckwy648,t3_2hvsw8,null,1426746166,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

If your looking for basic things like meat and veg then either are fine. Advice from the cooks in my family though is to use those products quickly from Aldi as they tend to go off faster. I'm not entirely sure what the difference is.

For all kinds of packaged foods you obviously won't find many of the big brands your used to seeing though they have some. Quite a lot of the unknown brands are totally fine though and a few I actually prefer to their big brand counterparts.

I'm not sure if all Aldi stores do it but the one near me keeps stocking random products whether they are small British brands or foreign ones. They only stock those things for a limited time (I don't know if they ever restock the same things) but it does make for some interesting variety when you shop there. I remember a type of sweet chilli and sour cream crisps that were awesome. I've tried the same flavour from big brands like Kettle and they weren't as good. It can produce some nice gems from time to time but like I said the fact that they only stock that stuff for so long is irritating.

For basic household amenities like cleaning products again its lots of unknown brands but they all work just as well as anything else.

Bottom line is after shopping there for a while and overcoming the possible urge you have to go for brands you know you'll discover a lot of things your perfectly happy buying and potentially prefer over big brands. Then on top of all that it is always cheaper like I'm sure you know. A lot cheaper. If your pushed for money or want to be more frugal with what you have then seriously go find an Aldi.

(copied from another comment above)

The Bechdel Test is a convenient and quantitative method that can be used for comparing large swathes of media over time.  

In science we use proxies and imperfect measures all the time for measuring things that are really hard or impossible to measure.  For example [LotkaâVolterra equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem_model#Example:_The_Lotka.E2.80.93Volterra_equations) attempt to distil predator-prey relationships into a simple formula.  They aren't perfect but they are used because there is no other way (or hasn't been, computer modelling is shaking stuff up) to compare predator/prey interactions between different species or ecosystems.

The Bechdel Test is an imperfect proxy for measuring the characterisation of females in media.  It can be used to track trends, like the second ugly graph on [this site](http://bechdeltest.com/statistics/) which shows that movies in general are getting better at having fleshed-out female roles over time.

Apart from an interesting thought experiment it isn't supposed to be used on individual films.  In Doctor Who's case I'd argue that it might be appropriate because there are so many episodes.",0,1412118522,null,0,false,0,ckwyr95,t3_2huc6d,t1_ckwyr95,t1_ckwk2xp,null,1426745893,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

&gt;

&gt;One of the earliest,  and most well-known, ecological models is the [predator-prey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation) model of [Alfred J. Lotka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_J._Lotka) (1925)  and [Vito Volterra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vito_Volterra) (1926).  This model takes the form of a pair of [ordinary differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation), one representing a prey [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species), the other its predator.

&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;

&gt;where,

&gt;Volterra originally devised the model to explain fluctuations in [fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish) and [shark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark) populations observed in the [Adriatic Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriatic_Sea) after the [First World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War) (when [fishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishery) was curtailed). However, the equations have subsequently been applied more generally.  Although simple, they illustrate some of the salient features of ecological models: modelled biological [populations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population) experience [growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusian_growth_model), interact with other populations (as either predators, prey or [competitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_Lotka-Volterra_equations)) and suffer [mortality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate). [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]

&gt;A credible, simple alternative to the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model and its common prey dependent generalizations is the ratio dependent or Arditi-Ginzburg model.  The two are the extremes of the spectrum of predator interference models. According to the authors of the alternative view, the data show that true interactions in nature are so far from the Lotka-Volterra extreme on the interference spectrum that the model can simply be discounted as wrong. They are much closer to the ratio dependent extreme, so if a simple model is needed one can use the Arditi-Ginzburg model as the first approximation.

A players attitude becomes very apparent over the course of a match, and balotelli still shows a bit too much ego at times. He will get up after a challenge or missed opportunity and saunter off rather than snapping right back into the game. This is not the appetite that I want to see from any of our players.

false,DrProfCapt,null,null,"I've had a pretty similar idea, except it was for four seasons and a movie
Season 1 features Paul McGann as the Time War starts. Maybe it starts with the Daleks versus some other species, and gradually works its way over to the Daleks versus the Time Lords. Whatever happens, season 1 would pretty much be a normal season of Doctor Who, with the Time War being the ""series ark."" We'd see the moment the Doctor realizes how substantial the Time War is in the last episode, but until then it's essentially the season of Doctor Who that Paul McGann never got.

Season 2 still features Paul McGann, but takes place primarily on Gallifrey. Throughout the season, the Doctor tries to help people as he traditionally does, but as the season goes on, his usual tactics grow less and less effective. The season finale would have to be a story where he explicitly does more harm than would've happened if he hadn't intervened. Maybe he leads a group of refugees to a ""safe zone"", but doesn't know he's also inadvertently bringing the Daleks or something, so the refugees and the other people already there are exterminated because of him.

Season 3 still features Paul McGann, as he becomes overwhelmed by the war. He decides to run away and try to have more adventures like in season 1, but people- like the girl in Night of the Doctor- have grown afraid of Time Lords. The overall ark of season 3 is him coming to terms with the fact that he can't escape the war, and it ends with the Night of the Doctor.

The movie is done in the style of a biopic, documenting the War Doctor from his youth, as seen in Night of the Doctor, to his final moments, as seen in Day of the Doctor. At first he'd be angry, since he was genetically engineered to be a warrior, but as he gets older- maybe runs into some people he saved in season 1- he begins to remember what made him the Doctor in the first place. He finally takes a step back from the war, and realizes that there's no happy ending. He's become so distraught after living hundreds of years in nothing but war (I assume hundreds of years- William Hartnell was 55 when he took the role, and his Doctor, at 450, died of old age. The War Doctor also dies of old age, so I have to assume it took around that long), it has to come to an end. Cue Day of the Doctor.

As improbable as all of that happening is, season 4 is by far the least likely, since it's not really necessary story-wise, and the lead actor is not very fond of the show. But season 4 would feature the ninth Doctor. I'm not only including this because he's my favourite and I miss him, but because we could see him deal more with his perceived ""aftermath"", which I think would be an interesting thing to revisit once we know the details. The first half of the season would take place before Rose, and the second half would take place during the end of Rose, after he leaves, and before he comes back and says ""did I mention it's a time machine?""

Reading really is the best thing you can be doing.

Also, think really deeply about why you want to do Chemistry. It's a PERSONAL statement - they want to hear about what the subject means to you, and what you've done to engage yourself in the world of chemistry.
