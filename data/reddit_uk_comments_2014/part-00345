[The third world benefits the most from GM crops](http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21630961-biggest-study-so-far-finds-gm-crops-have-large-widespread-benefits-field):

&gt;Many poor countries eschew GM crops, fearing they will not able to export them to areas which ban them, notably the European Union. This has a big opportunity cost. Dr Qaim and Dr Klümper found that GM crops do even better in poor countries than in rich ones. Farmers in developing nations who use the technology achieve yields 14 percentage points above those of GM farmers in the rich world. Pests and weeds are a bigger problem in poor countries, so GM confers bigger benefits.

And it is the possible of banning these crops etc. that will do great harm to Africa - something the Greens etc. should consider long and hard.

Remember that Africa is actually quite well developed - in general their businesses are fully-fledged industrial concerns, the days of the subsistence farmer are gone and subsistence farming is a truly miserable existence in any case.

Modern science and free trade and can help bring Africa to Western living standards far faster than it took Western countries to do the same.

I personally find the BBC way too subjective, then again, it's hard to pinpoint a non-full of shit news source because everyone seems to have an agenda, even if it's not a horrible one. I tend to look at a few and have discussions with people who aren't part of *any* news source (reddit is great for that).

false,Chazmer87,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"Let's assume a 2L engine, idling at 700 rpm, and throttled to 25% of outside air pressure, which is what I have found typical in an idling engine.

The amount of fuel consumed depends on the amount of air consumed. The amount of air consumed is going to depend on:

Engine displacement (2L)
Engine speed (700 rpm, which is 350 cycles/min for a 4-stroke)
Volumetric efficiency - how efficiently the engine exchanges air
Manifold air pressure - how much is the engine being throttled?

For the sake of argument, let's assume the volumetric efficiency is 100%. 
Let's also assume the engine is running at sea level on a standard 15C day, so the manifold air pressure is equivalent to the air density at sea level * 25% (because it's throttled to idle)

Air consumed will be:

displacement * cycles * volumetric efficiency * manifold air pressure

2L = 0.002 m^3

Air density is 1.225 kg/m^3 * 0.25

This gives us:

0.002 m^3 * 350/min * 100% * 1.225 kg/m^3 * 0.25

= 0.214 kg/min

Fuel used would be 1/15 of that (actually 1/14.7 in stoichiometric conditions), or 0.0143 kg/min

at 719.7 kg/m^3, that works out to 0.02 L/min

&gt;

&gt;__Isobel Campbell__ (born on 27 April 1976) is a [Scottish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_of_Scotland) singer-songwriter, cellist and composer. Campbell rose to prominence at age nineteen as a member of the Scottish indie pop band [Belle &amp; Sebastian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belle_%26_Sebastian), but left the group to pursue a solo career, first as __The Gentle Waves__, and later under her own name. She later collaborated with singer [Mark Lanegan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lanegan) on three albums.

&gt;Campbell's music has been described as either [indie pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_pop), [chamber pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_pop) or singer-songwriter. Regardless of genre, Campbell makes gentle and sombre music, often using classical instruments and her bright, slightly nasal voice with bittersweet and ironic songwriting.

1. Do you know what the current rate for your student loan? Is it the Student Loan Company or an arrangement with a bank? I'm sure the SLC is reasonably low, but it's good to know stuff like this. It's been a while since I had a student loan, but I recall the SLC's rates were creeping up. Annual interest on 20k could be considerable.

2. Figure out what your *actual* interest rate is for the Santander is after tax. It's the best current account out there for someone in your position. Good customer service too in my experience. Don't be afraid to jump.

3. The car thing: that is a **great** way to do this. I did the same myself a few times when I was getting a new (used) car and had tax cash lying around, earmarked for other things in six or twelve months time. You dip into your cash then make a spreadsheet to log repayments of your 'virtual' loan. Make the repayment period short and make yourself a hard taskmaster. You'll buy a less expensive car and you'll thank yourself later. And it's extremely satisfying to watch that virtual loan go to zero.

4. Buy a boring car! :D I'm joking but I'm kind of serious too. With this sort of income these sorts for margins for error, a fancy car with fancy maintenance bills will ruin all your careful planning. You're starting so well here - don't let your choice of car muck it all up. When you have more money you can afford to be frivolous :)

As you say this is pretty much only Central London.  I've recently visited two towns from my childhood, and neither have changed a bit.  Well, the blockbuster video stores were closed down, but otherwise the towns were identical.

&gt;British people are so genuine and easy to talk to. In Australia, friendships are more of a group thing and conversations are mostly small-talk about sport or consumerism. 

Funnily enough, the people I know that live in Australia tell me the polar opposite.  Everyone's friendly and have conversations with you, but people in England are so cut off, and pretty much ignore you.

&gt;British houses are so small. I didn't realise it at the time, but 4,000 sq ft houses with a double garage are the norm in Australia. In Australia, the entry price is much higher (at least £750,000) but you get a larger house within 10 miles of the city centre and next to the beach with great nearby amenities.

For £750,000 you'll have no problem finding big houses with big bedrooms here.

The 4231 leaves us lacking in the middle of the park with Henderson having to babysit Gerrard by himself and not having the help of someone the other side of him to do the additional running.

Considering our best performance of the year by far was the Spurs game (playing the diamond) it seems foolish not to revisit it even without Sturridge. I think playing Borini or even Sterling up front with Balotelli will create more space for him so instead of him having to deal with 2 centre backs he can actually receive the ball and bring some of the midfielders into play.

The only way I can see it is:  Parents buy house worth nominal value say £500,000 - makes no difference.

House is now worth £1.5m - you can only give £325,000 (per parent) before inheritance tax, so children stand to owe 36% of £850,000. (£306,000)

So they owe £306,000 on the inheritance of the house, which the kids can't afford - so they have to sell it.

But had the house not appreciated in value so much because of the housing bubble - you'd be able to afford to keep it with out having to pay inheritance tax and thus be able to live in the area and wouldn't be getting priced out.

Given your income levels and the fact that you don't currently drive it might be sensible to think of car ownership as an expensive luxury.

Not exactly ""supporting"" ISIS there.

&gt;On Oct 19, he posted a link on his Facebook page to a YouTube video by Ghassan Ibn Kamal, which presents Isil as a reasonable response to Western foreign policy. Mr Freeman wrote: “This brother hit the nail on the head.” 

That's not either, and it's true. Not ""reasonable"" but is in response to our foreign policy

&gt;Mr Freeman has also posted links to an Isil propaganda video made under duress by another of the group’s hostages, John Cantlie. 

I've been questioning the ""under duress"" parts of cantiles videos...

&gt;He has also tweeted: “Britain join war of terror. Drop bombs in populated areas. Innocent civilians lose loved ones = join Isis to get revenge.”

Thats just the same again, and is what people are doing.

&gt;On Oct 22, the day a terrorist gunman killed a soldier in Canada and invaded the country’s parliament, Mr Freeman stated on Twitter: “You can’t go around randomly punching people in the face without expecting a reaction. Same applies to bombing other countries.”

Uhh yeah I agree, but that's not what the OP says is going on:

&gt;The landlord has a friend who calls in periodically to pick up the mail while he's away and to check the property. That's fine: it's infrequent and we know when he'll be coming. But he cut a key for a different friend this year and that friend has been coming a lot more frequently, at least once a week, to do various bits of admin and printing. 

Unless this new friend is turning up and doing ""admin and printing"" in the OP's bedroom (which I highly doubt) then they are accessing the communal areas of the house, which the landlord or their representatives don't need permission to access. 

What's more unless they are turning up and doing this at like 3am or something it's hard to even establish your right to quiet enjoyment, because the sound of someone printing during daylight hours isn't going to be considered disruptive.

To me, neither Lallana nor Markovic make much sense for a diamond and two formation and that was a much bigger chunk of our transfer budget than was spent on strikers, so it wouldn't surprise me at all to see us play a more conservative/possession oriented 4-3-3 with Sturridge as the striker flanked by the likes of Sterling, Lallana, and Markovic.

Not always, even in the article the author states that voter participation was much higher back in the day, this would include all classes.
 The housing market of old, up to about year 1997 was much more stable, a working class man could buy a house anywhere, even London on a single wage.
This was due to restrictions and regulations on how much building societies and banks could lend. 3.5 x wage of single earner and 1.5 joint was the maximum and industry standard for housing loans, as a result housing costs were directly related to the average wage multiples as above.

Middle class youth have been forced to pay far higher for their education, the housing they aspire to own? they will be lucky if they get victorian working class cottages. Globalization and automation will also place further strain on middle class earning potential, and that is before we get to one of the core problems the author points out, welfare spending on Boomers is set to explode, which means those meager wages, barely affording a crap home are going to be taxed into oblivion to fund the pyramid scheme of NHS and welfare payments for a demographic with all the power.

Even 30 somethings with parents that own high value property are screwed, equity release, death taxes and asset (housing) taxes are inevitable to help pay for the shortfall and that is *if* they even manage to postpone the inevitable correction or housing market crash that has been on the cards since 2009.

There are two possible scenarios here:

or

false,rzam,lfc68,,"The problem with these sorts of tactical arguments is that they too often operate in the theoretical and the author assumes they know something about the team that management doesn't. Like, you can criticize Brendan all you want, but I seriously doubt there's any tactical setup known to football that he hasn't entertained. It's like when people say we should sign this footballer or that one, as though the thought hasn't crossed Rodgers' mind, when in reality it's been documented that the LFC scouting department -- like most top clubs -- have thousands of pages on virtually every top-level footballer worth knowing in the world.

I'm not arguing that fans don't have the right to observe and critique and pontificate about football tactics -- hell, that's a lot of the fun of being a fan. But allow me, as part of this discussion, to point out that 1) There's very, very little you see or think about football that isn't  dwarfed by what the professionals who run massive European clubs for a living know, 2) Football isn't a video game, you can't just plug various guys into given roles on a field and expect it all to click just because it makes sense in your head (these are actual people with actual strengths, weaknesses, personalities and tendencies) and 3) The notion that any club should stick to any one formation is absolutely ludicrous when you consider that tactics are, in essence, the art of ADAPTING your team to given situations on the field so that they can best succeed.

Besides, everyone who follows football closely knows you don't just tell a team to play 4-4-2 diamond and have them go out there and stick to that formation rigidly (well, unless you're Hodgson). In fact, most top teams are set up to play in different shapes in different scenarios (in posession, out of possession, offensive transition and defensive transition).

Plus, the idea that we should just pick one formation and stick to it incessantly is the exact opposite of good management, and the exact opposite of why we were so bloody good last year.

Well, that doesn't worry me so much, if their health expertise is staying in the UK.

&gt; We lose our medical staff to the US/Canada/Australia,  ...

Which is kinda a separate problem - separate but related - and one that certainly needs addressing. 

&gt; The NHS would be in far worse shape without the ability to 'poach' medical staff from elsewhere in the same way the US/Canada/Australia poach ours.

I completely agree that this is like a cycle or hierarchy, but it seems unfair on those at the bottom of the pile, those nations who lack enough good medics to look after their people. IMO this practice is ultimately unsustainable.

Shrugging our shoulders and saying ""there's nothing we can do about it"" seems like a blind acceptance that neoliberalism is inherent to globalism, but it's our own citizens who are being sacrificed to this capitalist treadmill. 

Why can't we get together with the US, Aus and Canada and say ""c'mon, guys, we're taking the piss here, we need to stop doing this to each other, and to the developing world""?

I'm not saying we should prevent you taking that job in the US that you've always wanted, or stopping you from moving to Canada, but we could all agree to train the same number of doctors and nurses we need. That way there wouldn't be such steep economic incentives for medics to emigrate.

Don't get me wrong - I know I've written idealistically. Realistically, I think the NHS is fucked, and I worry that the whole country is on a downhill economic slide.

I'm not suggesting its easy to put a formation out and expect it to click, however I genuinely believe this system if consistently implemented optimises the potential of the squad. I'm not suggesting to stick with the same formation for every game but look at Jose Mourinho, he plays almost the same style for every game as their tactics are so well drilled and organised into the players. Ancelotti, Benitez, Wenger, Fergie all primarily stuck to the same system of playing style for periods of time.

I agree its not easy, but thats why you hire world class coaches to improve the teams chemistry etc.

&gt;Between 2000 and 2004, textile exports from Swaziland, Lesotho, and Madagascar more than doubled, from $444.0 million to $1,063.5 million. For Lesotho, this represented about 75 percent of total exports, and the number of factories in this country rose from 21 to 47 with more than 50,000 workers employed. In Swaziland, more than 32,000 workers found employment in newly opened factories.

&gt;Textile exports from the three countries dipped an average of 12 percent during 2005 from the previous year's level and fell again by 6 percent in 2006. The impact on employment was particularly severe in Swaziland, where more than half of those employed in the textile sector lost their jobs. In Lesotho, about 15,000 of the 50,000 workers employed in that sector also lost their jobs, and about one-fourth of the factories shut down.

http://jae.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/5/781.abstract

&gt;The study finds that China has significantly decreased world prices in major markets for manufactures, especially textiles, wearing apparel and footwear, potentially displacing the clothing exports of the selected African countries [Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland, Namibia and South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius]. As a consequence of China's export growth, these focus countries have also seen substantial reductions in their import prices across all manufacturing sectors. However, an estimation of their terms-of-trade suggests that the reductions in export prices outweigh the decrease in import prices and the countries are deemed to lose from China's manufactures export expansion.

Almost all the children of the boomers grew up within a house, flat or bungalow that was being paid for by a mortgage.
 Average jobs and average wages were buying family homes up and down the country for most of us to be brought up in. 

This was always the way since post war Britain, how were we to know as teenagers that this situation was going to be turned on it's head? 
We are not taught this at school and even in the media vested interests will try telling you that high house prices are normal and have ever been thus.
Which is a complete lie btw. 
Housing is the most expensive thing most people buy and there is an information vacuum around the whole market for anyone 35 and under.
It's not eve a market anymore, it's a wealth transfer and wage redistribution scheme designed by politicians and spivs to buy votes from a more numerous and ignorant generation.
What market has constant market intervention by government to prop it up?

Help to buy 1 and 2? more like help to sell! 0.5% interest rates, funding for lending, new buy scheme, the list could and will go on.

 Funny how the ""market"" needs all this help to function and preserve high prices, this is has turned into a soviet style centrally planned economy. The government is picking winners and losers instead of the market and it stinks. They don't even have the good  grace to admit it.

Straight from their website:
&gt; CJ381 Recognising the nature of the female prison population, with high levels of mental illness, experience of being a victim of crimes such as sexual assault and domestic violence, and caring responsibilities for children, the only women who should be in custody are those very few that commit serious and violent crimes and who present a threat to the public.

&gt;CJ382 For the vast majority of women in the criminal justice system, solutions in the community are more appropriate. Community sentences must be designed to take account of women’s particular vulnerabilities and domestic and childcare commitments. The restrictions placed on sentencers around breaches of community orders must be made more flexible.

&gt;CJ383 Existing women’s prisons should be replaced with suitable geographically dispersed, small, multi-functional custodial centres. More supported accommodation should be provided for women on release to break the cycle of repeat offending and custody.

&gt;CJ384 Pregnant women in prison are particularly vulnerable and the scheme provided by the charity Birth Companions, which visits pregnant prisoners once a week, stays with them through birth and gives them support afterwards, should be extended to all women who wish to use it, with government funding.

more guidance from the State, more bureaucracy, something must be

false,AhmadiMuslimV1,null,null,"Barry, I know you will already be aware of exactly the positive roles mosques try to play but I will share this as an example for our more cynical friends:

The mosque I go to in London raised £250,000 for a number of different charities in 2012. An additional £120,000 pounds were donated to Queen’s charity to mark the diamond jubilee the same year. (I give figures from that year because its the only ones I could find online...the mosque has a congregation of about 10,000 by the way in case the figures seem absurd).

The same year 7,000 food packets were distributed to the homeless from the mosque. There were three blood donation sessions hosted at the mosque last year resulting in more than 300 units of blood collected for the NHS. 

The attendees of the mosque planted 8,000 trees during 2012 with environmental projects. They also worked with other local faith groups to preserve the local park and save it from being sold on for commercial use. This was a fine example of multi-faith cooperation. In addition, the mosque arranged for at least 10 litter picking sessions in the Merton area.

The mosque itself is open for public use. The local university uses the premises to hold exams. The mosque has hosted three external conferences, four borough council meetings and two council surgeries. An Armed Forces function was also hosted at the mosque. The mosque holds monthly liaison meetings with neighbours, churches, councillors, schools and police to discuss local issues. There were two well attended public job fairs in the mosque, organised by  the mosque's administration and visited by many private and public employers.

Around 33,000 guests visit the mosque each year. This includes student groups, teachers, representatives from different churches etc. And the car park is open for free use to locals regardless of their faith or ethnicity. 

The vast majority of the above, by the way, is done with zero publicity and simply for the purpose of serving the local community and is funded entirely by donations made by the local Muslims. :)",0,1416246753,null,0,false,0,cm552mm,t3_2mfdwa,t1_cm552mm,t1_cm5318v,null,1425980980,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

If you're interested in welding you might want to look into: http://www.cityandguilds.com/qualifications-and-apprenticeships/engineering/mechanical/3268-welding-skills#tab=information (also helpful if you want to emigrate) 

I'd read http://britishexpats.com/wiki/Category:Canada for a good rundown on Canadian immigration and also signup for an account on their forums so you can ask further questions.

/r/IWantOut is also an excellent subreddit for questions regarding emigrating to any country. 

Fortunately Canada is quite easy to get into. You could study for three years on a student visa and then gain a post-graduate work permit and then this would lead you to gain Permanent Resident status. (By far the easiest route and University in Canada is fairly cheap compared to the UK)

If that's not an option, you'd be best gaining a qualification in a trade, getting a few years experience, and then trying to come over as a federal skilled worked. 

It's all easier said than done. The britishexpats wiki is extremely useful so make sure you read through that thoroughly.

There might be more prisons for males (something that needs to be discussed as well) which makes it easier for them to be put close to home but what about those who don't get that chance? The big issue isn't with why they're doing it but rather the way they go about it. If you're in prison, you've most likely been charged for some sort of crime. If prison starts looking like a holiday in a cottage in the Highlands, what's the point of having prisons? There are a lot of men who are sent to prison for petty offences yet nobody talks about rehabilitation the way these ""researchers"" did in regards to females. Why not experiment for both rather than just completely ignore another gender? 

If you hear today's show, you'll see what I'm saying.

The thing about a lot of pork pies is that they’re made with cured pork. You can tell the difference by colour: cured pork is just pink, roasted pork far more varied with elements of grey, white and pink. Cured pork is cheaper and lasts longer, but IMHO it’s clearly the lower quality product. So as soon as a pork pie is made with cured pork you know you’re eating something where cheapness and shelf life has taken second place to taste, which is not a good start. Melton Mowbray pork pies can *never* be made with cured pork: it must be roasted.

Some cured pork pies are just about acceptable if the crust is well seasoned. Newboulds in Middlesbrough do a nice peppery crust on their pies which raises them up a little.

After gaining my qualifications I was unemployed for around 2 years, signing on and doing voluntary work, training courses etc, until I became a financial administrator. 

After leaving that job I retrained as a plasterer, which is my current profession (I work for a small firm but count as self-employed because I am a sub-contractor).

Music-wise I enjoy hip hop, jazz, electronic, folk, classical, rock, indie... I don't think there are many genres I don't enjoy.

I enjoy reading poetry, sci-fi, history, fantasy, politics, philosophy, general fiction and non-fiction. 

I enjoy art in many forms, regularly attend museums and exhibitions (when I can afford them). 

What does this say about me?

Well at no point have I owned my means of production, and I have always had to sell my labour in order to survive (or recieve wages in the form of unemployment benefits). This means I was, am, and will be working class until I die. 

My taste in music, reading etc means nothing. 

The working class has always voraciously devoured culture of all kinds wherever they have found it. A major part of the labour movement was about enabling working class people to read philosophy, appreciate art etc. 

Many artists, philosophers, musicians etc were working class. Liking these, participating in these is not an indicator of class. 

The middle and upper classes are more associated with these kinds of culture because they generally have more leisure time and disposable income to pay for these aspects of culture, but simply engaging in them does NOT denote class. 

Wearing a tie to work does NOT denote class.

Going to college or uni does NOT denote class. 

What denotes class is your relationship to your means of production and whether your only means of survival is working for a wage. 

You can be slightly wealthier than other members of your class, you can be more 'cultured' than other members of your class, you can work in a cleaner and safer environment than some other members of your class, but if you sell your labour for a wage you are still working class.

Are you having a laugh? We're on about preferential treatment and the way a professional defends the omission of males in this experiment. If you answer is ""so fucking what? They do it to us anyways"" , you might want to rethink your stance. You might not be for equality after all but rather what benefits your gender. This sort of ""oh well, tit for tat"" is the reason modern feminists aren't taken seriously. Exactly what you just did there. 

&gt; 
nternet radfems made noise over a shirt. Nobody else cared. But why on earth would you hear anything about this on the 6 o clock news? It's not some feminist conspiracy that nobody would give over a chunk of prime time news coverage to a bloody hypothetical prison.

You definitely don't watch the news do you? It shows the type of sweep it under the rug sort of ignorance that goes on everywhere when it comes to these sort of discussions. The man who had just landed a fucking probe on a comet was broken down to tears and made to apologise over a graphic shirt. It was everywhere. That's what they were banging on about all over. You completely miss the point. It's not hypothetical though is it, it's actually being built. If we were to say the same but with genders reversed, you think it wouldn't be all over the news? It's this sort of nonchalant ""oh you're just a butthurt male"" kind of attitude that puts me over the top. Females cry consistently that they're not being taken seriously yet I raise some concerns, I'm considered whingy. 

&gt; 
And you're foolishly blaming women for this when you should be blaming the elite who actually run things (and believe me, those folk have it in for women more than they have it in for you).

Exactly where did I blame women for this? Point out exactly where I've gone and blamed women. This is the sort of shit I'm on about. I make a completely legitimate comment and I'm labelled as just someone who's against women. That's how every bloody discussion that involves genders ends. If you're make and don't agree, you're bitter. You can go fuck yourself after making such a reach of an assumption.

false,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,"&gt; And speed becomes around three times more important to people choosing a broadband package when the speed is based on what 90% of customers would get, rather than just 10%. 

But that largely won't change regardless of which ISP you use. If the ISP is selling you plain old ADSL, it's going to be up to 8 or 24Mbps, and for fibre it's likely to be up to 80Mbps although Sky still sell 40Mbps. All of the ISPs sell the same speeds (except Virgin), just at different prices

And line length doesn't change because you're on another ISP. Moving from BT to TalkTalk will not change that. The only exception is moving from BT to Virgin, because they use totally different networks.

I just think that your proposal adds a bit more confusion into the mix. The ISP already sell it as an ""up to"" service and when you place an order you are told what they (well, Openreach) think you will get. There is no real mis-selling or bad advertising.

&gt; Personal estimates are definitely important, but not all providers give them at point of purchase and it's hard to hold companies accountable to the speed they quote. This is why we've also been calling for written speed estimates. 

But again, line length is something that is totally out of their control. They have no idea what speed your line really can do, until it gets connected. How do you propose to make ISPs ""accountable"" on that basis? If slow speeds were caused by a fault within the ISP's network (e.g. deliberate throttling) then sure, they should be accountable, but not for factors that they can't change.

Every ISP that uses BT lines will really be using the BT estimate, they don't create their own. And if the speed happens to fall short of what was estimated due to an error in that estimation, what do you think the ISPs will do about it? 

They can't move the exchange or the street cabinet closer to the user, and they're not going to make an investment to make things faster above sending possibly an Openreach tech out if something is grossly wrong. 

At best you could possibly allow a user to leave a contract without penalty. But then they'll just sign up to another ISP and get the same speeds?

If you want a cast iron guarantee of performance, that's when you get a business-level service - but it'll cost you. TalkTalk won't give you that for £1.50 a month

&gt; The principle is still the same though - why should people be enticed by speeds that they're very unlikely to get?

For reasons said above and in my other comment. It actually makes things muddier than a simple ""up to"" advertisement - and will make an ISP look worse than it really is. It becomes less about an ISP's quality of service and more about how far their customers live from the exchange or cabinet",0,1416249608,null,0,1416250593,0,cm56ok4,t3_2mjx8w,t1_cm56ok4,t1_cm55rff,null,1425980229,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

The stratification of the working class is simply a way to distract workers from seeing the things they hold in common with each other: their subjugation to their means of production, and their own exploitation in the form of wages.

'Cultural' aspects are simply different people liking different things. If the CEO of a bank likes hip-hop it doesn't make him more working class. A builder listening to Jazz doesn't make him more middle class, it just means he likes jazz. That's also leaving out the fact that jazz is a form of music created by and predominantly performed by working class people, so how it makes you more middle class I have no idea.  

I also think that the term 'cultural capital' is inherently elitist as it suggests that working class culture (yes that exists) or forms of culture from elsewhere in the world other than Europe are in some way less valuable because they give you less 'cultural capital'.

Working class culture, foreign culture is only looked down on as in some way lesser because they don't conform to the ideas of the ruling class.

The reason people find it so hard to pin-point their class by this new (or even the 'standard') definition of class is because they are false. 

I'm not saying there isn't variation in the ways of life of different working class people, but it makes much more sense to say that life in the working class is slightly different but the main point remains the same, than to split it into all these different and superficial ideas of class.

There's a lot  more to this than employment though. Legal discrimination would create an underclass of lower paid workers, especially for unskilled work where they don't have much bargaining power. 

From a philosophical or ethical point of view,  discrimination laws remind us that in the end owners of property or capital do so under our sufferance. 

In theory at least. They tend to be quite good at regulatory capture. And there perhaps lies the solution. Limit the amount of capital people can own, and we won't need discrimination laws, or a raft of other legislation beyond that.

People still refer to the current economic climate as a ""recession"" despite the fact that on paper, we have been out of recession for YEARS. Why do you think that is? Because none of the growth has actually reached people, we have some very nice looking GDP growth (which still hasn't kept pace with our population growth...) due to the house price bubble but it's not real growth and it isn't benefiting very many people at all. As far as the regular citizen is concerned they've seen price risings, pay cuts, job losses, and a credit squeeze for businesses.

It's not some made-up problem, it's happening and it's real. The global economy very nearly blew up in 2008/9 and right now we are in a position where interest rates CANNOT be lowered any more than they already are without causing bank runs, and governments don't really have much room for bailing out failing banks/other countries. We've shot all of our bullets and if the economy collapses again nobody is going to have a clue what to do.

It's almost the definitive economic component of fascism, and there are many sources - read pretty much any text on Mussolini's Italy.  But, for now, it's mentioned in the article I linked above:

""Hitler wasn't a socialist. Marxism is defined by class war, and socialism is accomplished with the total victory of the Proletariat over the ruling classes. By contrast, Hitler offered an alliance between labour and capital in the form of corporatism – with the express purpose of preventing class war.""

&gt;Still, definitely pretty socialist in the fact that the government controlled everything from prices to wages

Your definition of socialism seems to be State control, which frankly sucks as a definition of socialism.  Socialism is worker-control.

[Wrong (europlug)](http://i.imgur.com/t4uX5Zo.png). Just like yours, they are only wired halfway on the live and neutral pins.

[Wrong (grounded)](http://i.imgur.com/cflmL1B.png). Also note how it's still touching the ground pins (which we have two of) even though the live and neutral aren't inserted *at all*.

&gt;if you have a cord that's been yanked (say by a young'un) in the UK plugs the ground wire is the last to disengage.

Same here. The ground wire is always longer inside the plug and has enough margin for the live and neutral to always get pulled out before it.

All in all, I think we can conclude that both the mainland Northern European plug and the UK plug are pretty damn safe. (The Southern European plug is cross-compatible but has a different solution for ground, which I'm not too familiar with, so I don't know if it's equally safe.)

In any case, the real unsafe and horrible plug is the North American one.

false,willverine,null,null,"My concerns lie with Spurs' long history of front office dysfunction.

In 2004, Daniel Levy hired Jacques Santini to manage the team and Frank Arnesen to function as the Director of Football, dealing with transfers and scouting. After just 13 games, Santini quit due to conflicts with Arnesen. Apparently, Santini had very little idea of what having a DoF would be like.

Arnesen left shortly after, and Spurs hired Damien Comolli. Santini's replacement, Martin Jol, then publicly bristled with Comolli over control of transfers on numerous occasions. This went on for a couple years, then Jol was sacked and Juande Ramos was hired.

Juande Ramos then proceeded to complain of his lack of freedom with regards to transfers, and went on to fail in spectacular fashion, getting himself and Comolli fired.

The DoF was temporarily vacated and Redknapp was hired. This went on for 3 seasons, until he was sacked and AVB was hired. AVB went one season before Baldini was hired to fill the DoF role, under the new title ""Technical Director"". AVB was quoted as being pleased to have a DoF. That is until he too was sacked 4 months later, and hit out at the fact that Spurs didn't sign the players he wanted.

Fortunately Sherwood wasn't given enough time to complain! But it's totally crazy that we've had a number of DoFs and managers, and never once have they ever gotten along. It appears to be that they never wanted the manager/DoF management structure, or were not properly briefed on how it would play out beforehand. And NOW, we don't just have a potential manager/DoF flashpoint, but a manager-Technical Director-scouting/analytics director triangle, that I think has the very real potential to end very poorly.",0,1416251179,null,0,1416251906,0,cm57jgr,t3_2mjnvw,t1_cm57jgr,t1_cm55wnq,null,1425979828,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

21, finishing my undergrad this year (Music), doing a PGCE (Secondary) and qualifying as a teacher over the next 2 years, then emigrating to Europe or North America, where the jobs pay better, the living costs are cheaper and petrol doesn't bankrupt you.

Why would I stay in England?

Most non-educational jobs in my industry are in London. It's one of the big international centres for Music and the Arts... but the pay isn't exactly any *better* here than anywhere else in the country. There just isn't the money to go around (more on this beneath)

Even if I go into education in the UK, the syllabus is crap. Poor primary music education means that music lessons really start age 11 at the earliest.

I'm a dude.

&gt;This sort of ""oh well, tit for tat"" is the reason modern feminists aren't taken seriously.

The demonisation of modern feminists based on the actions of a minority of idiots and the ""tit for tat"" mentality you mention is why MRAs aren't taken seriously. Are you usually a campaigner for equal rights, or have you just worked yourself up into an impotent rage because women are going to have ""phones in each room"" (which is absolute bollocks, incidentally - nobody has proposed that)?

&gt;You definitely don't watch the news do you?

I certainly didn't see the shirt thing on the news. It's on plenty of news websites, but then so is the whole gamergate thing, and 99% of people wouldn't have a fucking clue what that was if you tried to talk to them about it.

&gt; It's not hypothetical though is it, it's actually being built. If we were to say the same but with genders reversed, you think it wouldn't be all over the news?

I actually remember when this was on the news, *two years ago when the prison was announced*.

&gt;Females cry consistently that they're not being taken seriously yet I raise some concerns, I'm considered whingy.

WOMEN CRY ABOUT NOT BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY BUT WHEN I CRY ABOUT THINGS PEOPLE DON'T TAKE ME SERIOUSLY I WONDER IF THERE'S A LESSON IN ALL OF THIS.

&gt;Exactly where did I blame women for this?

Your posts are just *dripping* with blame. The fact that you can hit out with a line like this:

&gt;I feel as if I'm just something to use and throw into the rubbish bin when I've been used for whatever purpose society has for me

while apparently under the belief that society caters far too much towards women is just fucking beyond ironic.

Whose definition is that though, of socialism? It's not one that most people would subscribe to I don't think.

Same thing, really, if you're a statist. It's weird, you're a lefty who wants to abolish the state. To me that's like...being a right winger who wants higher taxes.

Many of the 23 dead appear to have had well-paying jobs such as driving a HGV for the Highway’s Agency, or working for north London estate agents, and at least five of those in ICSR’s database were enrolled in, or had completed, higher education. However, Choukri Ellekhlifi, 22, and Mohammed el-Araj, 23, both from west London, had significant criminal records and had spent time in prison.

ICSR’s Shiraz Maher said most of the British dead had much better prospects than other jihadis from Europe known to have been killed. “These people come from every background imaginable but when you compare Brits to other Europeans, it’s clear that those from this country tend to be better educated, more affluent, and have greater social mobility than their peers on the continent.”

That seems like a misguided objection to me.

You may need to know your customers.  You haven't said what your service is, but it doesn't sound very like you're any kind of MSB and unless you're dealing in some high-value item like cars, I suspect you're not one and you don't have any KYC obligations.

Barclays needs to know their customers --- but they do, since the only customer in the relationship is you and they know you.  Barclays doesn't need to know Bitpay, since they're not holding any money on Bitpay's behalf and Bitpay merely sends settlements via international transfer.

Bitcoin itself cannot fail the KYC regulations, since it's not an entity, not an MSB so has no obligations.  It's no more an issue than if Paypal accepted sheep on your behalf, converted sheep to USD and sent USD to you by international transfer.

If you were planning to accept Bitcoin *directly*, all of this would change somewhat (actually not hugely), but you're not.

Unfortunately, however misguided their logic may be, Bitcoin is just a currency, Bitpay is just a foreign company, you're just a small client and UK banks have no obligations whatsoever, so nothing stops them making decisions to close your account if they don't like the associations with Bitcoin, even if they're indirect and Barclays is insulated from it completely.

I feel really bad for them. Has the council got rid of any council tax discounts for homes that aren't occupied? That'd be my first port of call. Maybe even put a council tax premium on homes that aren't occupied?

Edit:

&gt;Since 1 April 2013 where a property is unoccupied and unfurnished for a period of 2 years or more a 50% empty homes premium is payable.  Annexes being used as part of the main dwelling, and dwellings not occupied by service personnel posted away from home may not be subject to this premium.

&gt;In 2013, the Government amended regulations to allow councils to reduce the level of discount awarded for empty properties which are furnished, often referred to as second homes.  Cornwall Council reduced the 10% discount awarded to these properties to 0%.

I wonder if the council can add a second home premium. Sounds like it's unlikely as it seems to be a central government decision rather than local government.

Half of them revolve around the assertion that ""I've paid my taxes to fund the NHS and educate these kids and therefore can't be blamed for anything"" which of course misses the point almost entirely. If the argument was which generation has shouldered the greatest burden so far it would be a stupid question. The comparison should be between that and the burden that will be shouldered by under-30s in the next 3-4 decades. 

The other half either blame everything on immigrants or contain some sort of personal anecdote about how they were not extravagant in their youth and they saved up for a house so we should blame the governments not them, again missing the point entirely. 

[The average house price](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/16/house-prices-record-bubble-interest-rates-uk) is £272,000 these days meaning a 20% deposit will cost first time buyers ~£55,000. In London the average price is £514,000 meaning that deposit will set back first time buyers over £102,000. On average savers manage to put away [around £1200 a year (actually unusually high)](http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/saving/article-2301176/Savers-stash-away-100-month-average--biggest-NINE-years.html) meaning it would take that average saver 45 years to save enough for the average deposit on a house with mortgage payments possibly not ending until you die. If you're an average saver in London it would take you 85 years to save up just to *start* paying the mortgage on a new home. Quite how living frugally is going help in this circumstance is beyond me. 

Back in the 70s the average price of a house was a little over 2.5 times your [average annual wage](http://www.theguardian.com/worklifeuk/cost-of-living-1971-today). These days it is over 10 times. If 1970s people and 2010 people cut back by the same proportion it should take 2010 4x longer to raise a deposit. For every 2 years of austerity for 1970s people that's nearly a decade in penury for 2010 people. They say it's because young people can't budget properly....

There were no environmental taxes or tuition fee debt. Fuel in all forms is more expensive, the trains are extortionate. Job security was still a solid sensible concept as were [final salary pensions](http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/pensions/article-2572882/The-slow-death-gold-plated-pensions-private-sector-continues.html) which themselves have left a deficit of about £150 billion which the under-30s will pay for in less secure retirements. Unpaid internships, workfare and zero hour contracts are common place making money for employers all while unemployment is high and the requirements for entry level positions are more demanding than ever. It's entirely an employer's market and the resulting mess of stagnant wages and inequality must lie squarely on those employers. 

Probably the most annoying thing to me is that this is the group who came of age in the mid-60s (not the rationing enduring, NHS creating, Blitz spirited generation) - the hippie generation full of people that went to university for 3 years funded by the taxpayer, smoked inadvisable amounts of marijuana, joined the International Socialists, protested against the Vietnam War and were mildly interested in the more non-committal aspects of Buddhism. These were the bohemian underground anti-establishment, sexual revolution-having rebels who've grown up and created a more authoritarian and unequal society than the one they protested against and now they criticise young people for being unhappy about it under Daily Telegraph articles. They fail to see that it was post-war prosperity that allowed them the freedom to rebel and it is the low wage, corporatised, workaholic state of post-Thatcherite Britain they helped create that is exactly the reason young adults today can't afford to rebel. Living pay-cheque to pay-cheque is not the most sensible time to start getting uppity about your principles like those countercultural 60s rebels did.

false,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;AFAIK Nazism and fascism are considered to be entirely distinct by most modern historians.

Nazism is a specific subcategory of fascism.  No credible historian that I know of says the Nazis weren't fascists, but it's a particular form of fascism with additional characteristics.

&gt;Whose definition is that though, of socialism? It's not one that most people would subscribe to I don't think.

It's not the definition I would use (I'd probably use something more traditional like ""worker ownership and control of the means of production""), but then he's not really _defining_ it as saying how socialism is fully _achieved_.  Certainly _communism_ can't be said to exist if there are still classes in conflict, as the definition is a classless, stateless, moneyless society, and I doubt you'd find many communists who believed that it was possible to reach an accommodation between the working and ruling classes.  

Most communists and many socialists believe it's only possible to reach communism and/or socialism by revolutionary means, because the ruling classes will never give up their privileges democratically.  Of course, there still are democratic socialists (and even communists), but I guess it seems to me that Allende's Chile was the definitive final proof that capitalism will never allow socialism to happen democratically, and will always come in with guns blazing to kill socialists who are elected.

&gt;It's weird, you're a lefty who wants to abolish the state. To me that's like...being a right winger who wants higher taxes.

Heh, we weren't always such a minority view.  Ultimately, we're really just further left than State-""socialists""/capitalists and recognise that a State-elite can be just as oppressive as a private elite, depending on the degree of democratic control, and that capitalists/feudal lords/kings/slave-owners/etc. have always used the State to secure their dominance over politics and therefore the economic system (indeed, divine-right kings espoused identity with the State - ""L'État, c'est moi"", which is kind of where the whole left-right thing came from).

&gt;There aren't any famous anarchists to attribute any misdeeds to, at least that I'm aware of - unless Proudhon had a passion for slaughtering kittens we haven't yet discovered.

Oh, they were all flawed human beings (Proudhon was arguably misogynist, perhaps ant-Semitic too, Makhno was accused of rape by a one-time friend turned enemy, etc.), but then that's pretty much the whole argument of anarchists - that scum and bastards rise...if you let 'em concentrate power...",0,1416254501,null,0,false,0,cm598z1,t3_2mjofi,t1_cm598z1,t1_cm587q2,null,1425979031,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

This I do agree with. A large subsection of the middle classes will definitely be hit in exactly the same way the working classes were in the late 70's on when they were no longer needed in the Steel / Coal / Docks / Car Factories etc. This is when they lost their political clout.

The middle classes have the same fate in store for the same reasons. This will lead to a big chasm mainly along the lines of property and public school (10%ers) but a lot of the knowledge economy middle classes have a tidal wave about to hit them.

20' Kane scores. - Lovely dink over the keeper off a through ball from Ince.

22' Kane scores again! - Ince with a lovely turn and puts it across the face of goal for Kane to tap home!

30' Gooner scores. - Sloppy play by England's back line allows Sanogo to finish across goal and off the left post.

43' - Sanogo scores again. :(

HT: England U-21's 2-2 France U-21's

73' Coman scores and it is probably deserved for France. 3-2.

**FT: 3-2 France wins.**

Post-Match Thoughts:

Tom Carroll is one of the most fun players to watch pass a football. His role as a Deep-Lying Playmaker is perfect for him. His passing today was as good as always, and he was magnificent to watch. Pritchard was unfortunate to get subbed at half. While I thought he wasn't nearly as involved as he should have been, he was largely isolated with Kane. He was definitely the hardest-working player on the pitch when he was out there though. Kane had a decent game. Yes, he got two goals, the first being much nicer than the second. Other than that, he was very isolated the whole game. Yes, he made some good runs here and there, and tried to be a nuisance for the French defense, but besides the two goals I think he'll wish he did better today. Unfortunate for Southgate to lose his first game in charge, but I must say that this French team is very, very good. 

-----------

Spurs Players:

Kane: 

-Has been isolated a lot of the first half, but has scored both his chances.

-Kane making some fine runs early in the second half.

-Has really hounded the French back line in the second half, is a constant nuisance for them.

**Subbed on 65'**

Pritch: 

-Hardest working player on the pitch at the moment.

-It's obvious he's willing to come deep for the ball, but not as deep as Eriksen. Hard-working in the first half.

**Subbed at half.**

Carroll:

 -Played a beautiful left-footed through ball early in the game from deep which unlocked the French defense.

 -Played Kane through, but the striker was deemed to have fouled his defender.

 -Cautioned in the 63'.

-------
General Thoughts:

-The back line has had a lot to deal with in this game, and the left side looks very vulnerable. Garbutt not having his best game.

-The pitch is SLOPPY. Both teams dealing with slippage, especially Kane.

-Carroll linked up well with Pritch before his ball in to Kane was sniffed out by a French CB.",0,1416255769,null,0,1416261401,0,cm59xae,t3_2ml1d2,t1_cm59xae,t3_2ml1d2,null,1425978716,15,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,15

This was one of the things that was really emphasised, that Americans tend to form lots of disposable, surface level friendships, with only a few of them developing further. Whereas British people form fewer friendships but care much more about the depth and quality of each. Therefore it was warning the US students not to get upset if people they'd met didn't automatically call them a 'friend' because the word carries more weight over here.

Cawl, rarebit and Bara brith.  She has a great recipe for Bara Brith, but she doesn't have it handy.  It's a little unconventional, since it includes Jack Daniels.

&gt; 6 - What else? Tell me things.

* There's a big North and South divide, even the language spoken has differences. For example, ""llaeth"" in the South and ""llefrith"" in North for the word ""milk"".  

* There are many famous Americans, e.g. Thomas Jefferson's family were originally from near Llanberis.

* Patagonia is a region in Argentina that have a Welsh-speaking population because Welsh settlers arrived through the 19th and 20th centuries.

Dedicated/guaranteed bandwidth circuits do exist - for my office the 100mb circuit is about a grand a month. Virgin 100mb is 30 quid - that should give an idea of the difference in service to deliver a guarantee.

The simple fact is that the consumer can't have it all. We've driven prices down to ludicrous levels, you can get a broadband connection for a couple of quid a month, if we started prioritising quality over price then things might change. The current system doesn't need changing at all IMO, it's perfectly clear what the words ""up to"" mean and you get a decent estimate when you sign up. If you're paying £50 a month then it might be reasonable to expect a pro rated price or something but when you're paying £5 a month I just don't see the argument 

The other thing to bear in mind is there are way too many factors outside of the ISPs control for them to guarantee anything.

An errant ferret chews through the wiring and your speed drops below the ""guaranteed"" level - is it honestly fair to expect Sky to pay a compensation?

It's alien technology. They have this tachyon bremsstrahlung field that instantly heats something inside the field to over 700ºF. 

A liter of water, heated to 700ºF gives you 1500 liters of dry steam. 1500 liters of dry, supercritical steam contained in a volume of a liter is 1500 times atmospheric pressure, or 1500 bar. However, since it's not contained, it will start expanding immediately, which gives a bang.

Housing and planning

– Houses on brownfield sites will be exempt from Stamp Duty on first sale and VAT relaxed for redevelopment of brownfield sites.

– Planning Permission for large-scale developments can be overturned by a referendum triggered by the signatures of 5% of the District or Borough electors collected within three months.

The argument for ""neither"" is that this was a global failure which originated in the US and would have damaged our economy whatever regulation had been in place.

As the team warms up, the camera is focused on Sturridge. But there is a commotion on the sidelines. Roy Hodgson has just come out of the players tunnel. There is a brief shot of Rodgers with a confused expression on his face.

Hodgson walks across the pitch to Sturridge, who does not notice his approach. About halfway there, Hodgson breaks into a shuffling jog. Sturridge plays a first time pass to a teammate, then shakes his legs out, seemingly to loosen some of the tension he is feeling on his important return.

Hodgson is close now, he starts running, sprinting towards Sturridge. The crowd begins to roar with thousands of surprised exclamations. Sturridge, hearing the commotion, turns around just in time to see a furious owl-faced Hodgson leaping through the air at him in a vicious two-footed tackle.

Sitting at home, Hodgson holds a newspaper with the headline 'ENGLAND MANAGER SACKED'. But his gaze is drawn by a smaller article down the page. A picture of Sturridge lying on the pitch in pain, with the caption, 'Knee scans put Sturridge out for season. Possible career ending injury.'

Hodgson leans back in his chair, smiling. It had not been the most subtle approach, but it had been effective. Liverpool would certainly miss out on the top 4 now.

Certainly, no more criminal than some of the drastic austerity measures the current coalition are carrying out in the UK which are completely reordering the social compact.

Not really to prevent the nationalisation of their copper concerns, but to prevent ""the prospect of a moderately successful extreme left-wing regime in Chile...if only because of the effect this might have elsewhere in Latin America"".

""Accounts for the year ending May 31, 2014 were published on Friday by Arsenal and revealed that the annual wage bill had increased to £166.4 million, while revenues exceeded £300 million for the first time in the club’s history. This summer’s transfer activity, however, is not included in the accounts and the net increase to the wage bill following the arrivals of Alexis Sanchez, Danny Welbeck, Mathieu Debuchy, David Ospina and Calum Chambers is around £15 million. That would put the wage bill for this current 2014-15 season at over £180 million. This will fluctuate slightly depending on performance-related elements of the contracts.

Chelsea’s most recently disclosed wage bill was £176 million, for the year ending 2012-13, but the Telegraph can reveal that this figure has stayed virtually static over the past two years amid the departures of older, higher-profile players like Frank Lampard, Ashley Cole and Fernando Torres.""

How often do you need *more* control of the power delivered to the wheels?  How much more control does a manual provide versus an automatic, and in which common situations do you think it would be necessary?

I'm pretty sure active traction control does a better job than the average Joe with a clutch and a manual gearbox.


&gt; better fuel economy 

Maybe 10+ years ago

No the case any more. An automatic will always change gears at the optimum time and it's almost impossible to over-rev the engine in an auto.  In a manual, you can easily over-rev and use more fuel than you need to.

Also, modern autos are more fuel efficient because they offer better, smoother, gear changes and more gears. Think 7+ gears.  That would drive a manual driver crazy.

&gt; better reliability

Not sure what you mean here. Are you saying that automatic gearboxes are ""unreliable"", or that a clutch is more reliable over an automatic gearbox?

You or I might not have seen that coming but then we are not in charge of multi-millon pound transfers. Baldini and Levy have wasted the Bale money because they don't have the insight and knowledge to work out who will work in the team and in the league. This is why you hire a competent manager to build his own team.

Look at Mourinho sidelining and then offloading Chelsea's player of the year Juan Mata. No-one understood why but now it makes perfect sense. Levy doesn't get this. He buys talented young players for the squad and expects a head coach to mould them into a team to get top four. It's a demented policy and that's why we are in the bottom half of the table. Why was Ben Davies signed ? Pochettino doesn't want him in the team. It's just the latest example of the boardroom signing players the team doesn't need.

The closest we got to doing things right was under Redknapp, who only agreed to save us from relegation if he was allowed to bring in his own players. Two top four finishes but Levy hated the lack of control so punted Redknapp at the first opportunity. Now we have some mug in the dugout who has no serious clout. The players know they can down tools and the manager will get sacked. What do Ramos and AVB say after getting the sack? They complain about having players forced upon them they didn't want.

I've read through this thread a few times to get a good overall view of those already commenting.  Here's my contribution:  I started riding as a small child,  my Da was big in to cycling and so it was a natural progression for me to follow his example.  Before leaving primary school I was well established at cycling both on and off-road.  I have taken all manner of safety courses/cycling proficiency/green cross code/defensive road use/beginner, intermediate off-road/mtb'ing classes.  From a young age we'd set off from town and head up Slemish mountain most weekends.  I mostly cycle the Mary P tracks and Belvoir around Belfast,using the roads where it's practical and I do a bit of riding in and around the town.  Drivers in Belfast are a pack of ill-mannered, dangerous people who seriously need a fucking grip on reality.   As has been mentioned a bike has right of way over cars, like it or fucking lump it.  I'm not slow, I can scoot about on tarmac at 24mph average so there's no need to get arsey when you're behind me.  As stated in here with the wing mirrors, it has happened, as have plenty of size 12 shaped dents in doors and wing panels and boarding buses to roar down the Translink wankers, they're the worst! The way I look at it is; my bike weighs less than 15kg, a car usually weighs well over a ton, if you purposefully (or accidentally through inattention) endanger me while I'm travelling you will be dealt with accordingly.  I get plenty of abuse from drivers who always then shite themselves when I draw level at lights/stop signs etc. the worst are the people who look dead eye ahead and refuse to even acknowledge the large  6'4"" figure screaming through their window.  I have been assaulted, clipped by wing mirrors, forced on to footpaths and once forced in to oncoming traffic. For cycling.  At all times I obey the road rules and never ride recklessly,  I seldomly ride at night so the 'didn't see you there mate' excuse doesn't wash with me.  I hardly ever wear a helmet on the roads either, this is just plain stupidity on my part but also my choice.  I am a driver too and when I drive I would happily drive from Dundonald to Dunmurray behind a cyclist and not get the hump if I couldn't overtake.  In reality drivers are encased in metal (good song title) and as a result immediately forget the dangers they pose to us on the road.  I've never gone the GoPro route but would well be up for cycling about town diming on scumbag motorists.

Some might argue that low-paid migrant workers are ""slaves to capitalism"" or ""wage slaves"" but that is different to actual modern slavery. The workers are there by choice, earn several multiples what they would at home and, by and large, are treated reasonably well. 

Of course they should be paid more but when you bear in mind that the average salary in India is $100 a month, you can probably understand why they are clamouring to get work in Dubai and earn several times that. It seems like a pittance to us but to them it is one of the few options they have for breaking the cycle of poverty.

You don't have to take my word for it though. Economist Michael Clemens wrote a report on migrant workers in UAE in 2013 ([source](http://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/seize-spotlight-labor-migration.pdf)). He had this to say:

&gt; First, the economic benefit to migrant workers is extraordinarily and systematically large: migration to the UAE for basic construction work causes their daily wage to rise by a factor of five, and causes employment to rise by at least 20 percentage points. Second, there is no sign that many of the commonly-mentioned costs of migration are systematically experienced by migrants' households; migration to the Gulf causes the fraction of households in debt to sharply decline, and there is no evidence of labor force entry by school-age children or labor-force exit by adult family members. Third, households are generally well-informed about working and living conditions in the UAE, and there is no evidence that they enter into migration systematically overestimating the benefits. Households with migrants give estimates of migrants' income that closely reflect true income in UAE administrative records.

&gt; London was so multicultural and that he ""didn't feel like it was England""

I'll be honest when I'm working in London it does not feel like I am in Britain - it feels a very self-contained place if that makes sense.

The rate of change primarily driven by change in England is crazy though. I lived in Slough and High Wycombe and moved up to Edinburgh at the turn of the millennium - I was back round that area recently and the change has been absoluely momentous in just under 15 years.

The problem is not multiculturalism where cultures assimilate but where cultures live in silos. If that makes any sense

&gt;I support multiculturalism because who is to say that English culture is the best culture for the people in England? Maybe Pakistani or Nigerian culture would suit them better? 

Well that can be argued to a point. There are some aspects of the latter two cultures that I'd rather not have imported into the UK being totally blunt with you. 

&gt;I think schools should have a massive campaign to teach all children especially the ""indigenous"" ones that this country has no natives, it's just been constant string of immigrants like the United States.

false,coffpet,null,null,"I think the whole situation is even more complex then they are leading on. The only way to simplify our issues is by stating that we've been in a constant transition period for almost 5 years, since Harry was looking at the England job. 

At points during last season we'd have said, ""Outside of Eriksen, Paulinho is the only one of the seven who might come good, him and Chiriches"". But, now a year later it looks like they'll be the two sold this January. 

Dembele was honestly a truly key player for us in his first season. But, now he also looks like he's on his way out. 

My point is that none of these players are really trash in my opinion, but they're just constantly in a period of shuffle and are never sure what to expect. Anyone who has been here for all four of our managers has had to deal with 4 very different sets of styles and expectations. 

Hell, as a fan I haven't known what the hell to expect in and out of these last handful of years. If someone had told me exactly one year ago today that AVB was going to be sacked, mind you a week before the 6-0 against City and a month before his firing, I honestly would have called them mad. 

Maybe I'm just the most optimistic Spurs fan around, but I expect us to come good if we can just chill the fuck out as a club for a little bit. No max exodus. Sell 2 players tops this January, only bring in one squad player maximum and only one starter. 

Eriksen is 22 and will continue to come good. Lamela is also only 22 and has shown glimpses amongst his struggles, plus his price tag isn't his fault so we can't judge him on that going forward. Chadli has proven his worth. Capoue has proven a lot of positives, but has fallen a bit recently, but Jesus we need to give him a little more time. Soldado hasn't started a good run of BPL games in like a year. Paulinho is probably out of here, but honestly I think he'll be a great player in a system and club where he feels comfortable. Chiriches is in a similar situation to Paulinho in my opinion.

However I've gone back to Sainsbury's for most stuff, and even a bit of Waitrose, which contrary to received wisdom is actually mostly comparable in price with Sainsbury's, but better quality. And much friendlier. 

Reason we didn't continue with Aldi was that quite a lot of the stuff (food, beer, etc) really tasted very average, and in some cases, awful. Plus we didn't like eating food with enough preservatives to  survive the nuclear apocalypse.

Even buying fresh stuff I found that things just tasted of polystyrene and lasted ludicrously long. I had a box of avacados which were tasteless green mush when fresh, but when I left a couple on the side they never actually rotted, they just went rubbery. Meh.

false,xu85,null,null,"I get the distinct impression that wearing a camera on your commute or day to day business fundamentally changes your behaviour. Partly because it takes a specific kind of person to wear a camera. Someone who has been in lots of run-ins and constantly thinks the world is against him. 

I believe cameras make you behave in a slightly riskier way, in a subconscious attempt to bait other road users or pedestrians into doing something that'll make a great Youtube clip, and simultaneously paint you in a victim light. Having a camera rolling also G's you up. Most people would try to avoid conflict, someone with a camera rolling will feel more powerful and therefore *cause* conflict. When confronted with a contrary view, cameraman can claim he literally did nothing wrong, and he is also supported in his youtube comments by plenty of other Motorcyclists or Cyclists he's friends with on social media which creates a kind of bubble where he's surrounded by people patting him on the back. It's win/win - he is simultaneously a victim of bad driving, and also standing up for the little guy and getting Youtube likes which validates his actions. Furthermore the editing power is totally within the uploaders hands, he can edit the previous 30 seconds where he called a driver a *f**king knobjockey twat*, or just not upload all the times he behaved in stupid ways giving a viewer a misleading impression of his overall roadcraft.

A typical example might be a cyclist cycling in the middle of a lane in a two-lane carriageway. Now *technically* he is perfectly within his rights to do so, but a reasonable person faced with an aggressive driver revving his engine behind him trying to get past would cede some space and move slightly left. Armed with his camera, the bicycle warrior, desperate to ""highlight injustice"", would stay in the lane in an attempt to get the driver to do some dumb shit like overtake with too little room.

Some graduates are struggling to land jobs, yes, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Graduates now have options, when before they would have been locked out of professional jobs by an education system that massively inflated the value of higher education by making it inaccessible.

&gt; just they didn't hit some arbitrary target of a 2.1 degree classification and suddenly are shut out of certain jobs for seemingly no reason.

Because they're not qualified enough? I'm not sure what the logical leap is here, could you explain?

&gt; That along with the fact that some jobs which really don't require a degree at all are asking for massively overqualified people and paying them far less than what they ""fairly"" deserve.

All evidence seems to indicate that degrees have noticeable returns compared to simple A Levels, of around 20-30% over a lifetime.

false,havetribble,null,null," Hey there young NatSci! I'm studying double Geology and Materials Science in Pt 1B. I actually didn't really like Earth Sciences that much - I'd always wanted to be a physicist - and didn't work concentrate on it for the first two terms. Rock identification? Ha! ""Um, is it a granite...?"" The year progresses with me seeming ever behind until the Arran trip just after Lent term. Seeing things in the field really helped me get a better idea of how things connected, and what the point of all these rocks and maps were. I started to 'get it', and now I really love the subject. 

Now that's not saying you will have this experience. Most of my friends who switched to geology decided to do so after Arran, but many stuck with Physics. They could have probably failed Earth Sciences and been okay, as long as they passed overall. 

Also, it isn't necessary to remember all the details from every lecture. I didn't really look at paeleobiology (Lent and Easter term) at all during revision. It isn't an area I'm comfortable with and you don't have to answer a question on it in the written paper, though you will have to identify fossils and their modes of life, habitats etc. in the practical exam. 

Final tip - and this is one that was passed onto me pretty late despite it being an amazing help for just about the entire course - buy a used copy of the OCR Geology A Level textbook - OCR AS and A2 Geology Student Book https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0435692119/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_-kOAub021C3D8. This is pretty expensive so search on eBay too. It covers just about the entire 1A course in almost enough detail for the exam and is a brilliant revision guide. Also of use is 'A Colour Atlas of Rocks and Minerals in Thin Section' by MacKenzie and Adams. This is great if you're having trouble identifying rocks using the microscopes and might be available from your college library; the Earth Sciences library should definitely have a copy and is a really lovely place. Sarah the librarian is one of the nicest people you'll meet in Cambridge! 

Finally, if you have any more questions, worries or just want to chat to someone who's been through the same course just last year, then please send me a private message. I'm very happy to help! Hope you enjoy things more in the future.

&gt;__HMS *Cockchafer*__ was a [Royal Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy) [Insect-class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect_class_gunboat) [gunboat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunboat). She was built by [Barclay Curle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclay_Curle) and launched on 17 December 1915 as the fifth Royal Navy ship to carry this name.   The Insect class was originally designed for service on the [Danube River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danube_River) but most of them spent much of their service on Chinese rivers.

false,buttermilkwaffledick,null,null,"I think Capaldi is way better than Matt Smith and that Series 8 was far better than 6 or 7 in terms of being much more cohesive and having way more consistent quality episode to episode. 

But I also think that the Amy/Rory/Doctor dynamic worked better than what Moffat built with Clara -- both with Smith and Capaldi. And the strain of her lack of development showed in this final season and threw things off kilter.

Because Clara was never properly fleshed out, and because her boyfriend was annoying and her Father was never really explained and the family she nannied for just sort of disappeared, it was impossible to really think of her as a ""grounded"" character.

I disagree that the show needs to be more about the Doctor -- it does make sense to put a spotlight on the co-stars who walk in and out of the show, because they do bring in new stories and new perspectives, which help to keep the show fresh. But it's hard to do that when you're given now clue as to who the Companion *is*, and yet the show still focuses on her in her undeveloped state.

Which means that Clara wasn't the anchor that the story needs from a companion (even though Jenna-Louise was excellent performance-wise), and as a result the episodes did lack an emotional gravity necessary to keep my attention.

Which is a shame. I think it's hard to have a show that gets casting right, and introduces fun story ideas, but fails on character development so much that it ruins the season as a whole.

""Let's Kill Hitler"" is one of the most horrific squanderings of potential I have ever seen on television:

(1) He sets up the idea of River being a Time Lord! ... and then immediately takes away her regenerations in the next episode.

(2) He has this amazing idea of the Ponds' childhood friend being revealed to be their daughter. But rather than properly developing that idea (by having her show up prior to the episode and then revealing the truth) he tosses it away in 5 minutes.

(3) He sets up this incredible character/action drama where the murderous Melody Pond needs to become River Song... and then breaks the back of the character by resolving that entire epoch of her life in 5 minutes.

Consider for a moment the reality where Mel shows up earlier in the season and gets invited aboard the TARDIS. She comes along on a number of adventures... but on many or all of those adventures there are mysterious assassination attempts on the Doctor. Mel eventually reveals herself as the assassin and *that's* when we get ""your named your daughter after your daughter"" and minds are truly blown.

Now, on the flip side of that, we get at least a season of Mel (possibly played by Alex Kingston now) periodically turning up. Usually with some new assassination scheme, but over time the Doctor starts convincing her to help save people. And the character gradually grows and becomes something more. During this phase the phrase ""Who is River Song?"" becomes Mel's catch phrase.

Indeed [eia data](http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/iedindex3.cfm?tid=91&amp;pid=46&amp;aid=31&amp;cid=regions&amp;syid=1980&amp;eyid=2011&amp;unit=MTCDPUSD) back to about 1980 show that carbon intensity of gdp just seems to oscillate around a constant value, hard to draw much of a conclusion from it.

Your second point is also incorrect, as it assumes presumably constant efficiency improvements, which is not what happens in the real world.  At some point, processes get close to maximum efficiency, and you get no more gains from them.  It also assumes a linear response to declining energy generation.  I suggest you attempt eating 1.7% less food each day, and note how the response to this is eventually nonlinear.",0,1416272614,null,0,1416273071,0,cm5ivne,t3_2mjqzs,t1_cm5ivne,t1_cm5i8xq,null,1425974468,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I called the PF's office first thing and was told that there didn't appear to be a warrant out for me. The clerk did however say that she couldn't be sure and wouldn't discuss it any further with me so I got in touch with a solicitor. 

He found out that when I failed to appear for a date back in July a warrant was issued but I was also sent a letter giving me a chance to appear in court in early August without having to be taken into police custody first (I forget the term he used but apparently had I turned up that day my name was already on the docket and I could have got it dealt with.) When I failed to turn up for that the entire case was dropped as they decided I wasn't worth pursuing due to my complete and utter lack of communication.

tl;dr got away with it and I realize I'm a very very lucky man.

The driver realised the road was clear, he knew his driving ability and he wanted to test his bike (probably). The bike was probably either new or newly modified and, judging from the OP's comment history on the YouTube video, he does like to mod his bike.

So, the cop (being a motorcyclist, too, and who was also a young man) probably realised that it's uncommon for the guy to pull stunts like that, and that arresting him would probably do more harm than good. A stern word about stupidity in the streets probably has more of a chance of getting through to him than jail time for a fairly petty crime (I'd say drunk driving is way worse than a quick sprint on a bike, especially when it's obvious no-one can really cross that road).

I would also broaden it to those of a working class background and more limited education who had worked their way up the ladder, and those of a middle class background who perhaps ""dropped out"" of a city type career but still did some kind of professional work, eg a sculptor or a volunteer or a therapist.

Reems of them, Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury

This in a village of 10 houses

Almost as if they get your postcode and fake a load of jobs which will get you sanctioned of you don't apply

Go to apply for first one at Asda, wow this directs me to a dodgy Asda website requiring all my details including driving licence number, old addresses, NI number etc

This is the same day I apply for a few more using my CV which has my mobile number on

What's this? Straight after submitting my CV for the required minimum 7 jobs I have phone call after phone call from loan companies, from PPI, from loan brokers, insurance companies, lottery companies

All coincidence as my advisor said, having had the same number since 2004 and had no marketing or spam calls I was unlucky to just start getting them after entering my CV to jobs on UJM

All said with a straight face, such massive arrogance to treat you like a brain dead moron who would really think that

The next week off upstairs to see the head advisor, a bloke who couldn't use a keyboard without stopping after every keystroke and looking to see what he typed

He said UJM was ""wonderful"" and a ""revelation""

He left me 3 jobs on my UJM inbox thing I had to apply for before the next session a month later, this was just with him.

That night I went in the inbox, his 3 jobs on UJM were:

The same job twice at a company in Sudbury, they were looking for a lorry driving with an HGV licence.

I haven't got an HGV licence, but no matter, I applied twice

3rd job was volunteering at the cats protection league shop in Halstead 

Don't know what that's to do with driving but never mind, but oh I can't apply for this via the UJM site, I have to register and print off an application form

Looking through I see the job doesn't exist, it expired in July 2012, and this was at the time February 2014.

Never mind, I ""print"" the application form off using my non existant printer which I said to him I didn't have, and send my invisible application in to apply for the invisible job

And this, total scandal, absolute fuck up on that cunt IDS's watch, is what people using this abortion of a site have to put up with

You can call them a minority but the fact is they're the loudest. They're certainly not a minority. No, I've always supported equal rights. Never chosen a side. You seem to come up with stupid accusations that are made up. Did you listen to the show? Because you can band about how it's absolute bollocks but you've got no evidence that it wasn't said. I actually do and not going off emotion. 

Really? It wasn't in the news because they discussed it when they were chatting about the Violet landing. My mate in USA also told me that it was on CNN and other news channels. You do realise we live in a digital age where people don't just sit in front of the telly for their news right? Nobody gave a toss about gamergate because nobody actually cares about the inner happenings of the gaming world. Are you also surprised that it wasn't talked about on a national level? The fact that apparently so many mods and justice warriors tried to ban anyone taking about it or keep them quiet just goes to show how most things are handled, swept under the rug. 

So there you are, saying you heard it 2 years ago on the radio, then you have the balls to tell me is hypothetical when I've just told you they've said they've got a facility in Inverclyde? I'll ask again, how about you listen to the programme before you making accusations. 

I'm allowed to be irked by certain things. Clearly where you're from, you like to just ignore the issue and not chat about it. It's the way you like to solve things. That's not the way I deal with things. I'm not crying for anything but I'm just shocked by the way lot like you can just brush off issues like this. 


Yet again, you claim it drips of blame yet you've failed to give me proof. You give out accusations like a father Christmas gives out presents on Christmas day. Show me where I blamed women. 
. 
Who the fink says I was under such a belief? You're daft as they come. I felt like I'm disposable because of what one of the researchers said in regards to children and parents. If you listened to the bloody thing, you would know but no, let's make assumptions based on the hot air that fills my body and seeps out of my arse. Go listen mate and stop chatting gas. 

Again, I'm going by what I heard on the radio, you go by what you feel not facts. I've given you proof of why I feel as women are getting preferential treatment in this case yet you've done nothing but constantly accuse me if being against women. That's very ironic because that's the very concern of mine to which you've answered to buy being the very hypocrite in on about. I brought up an issue which I very justifiably am against and you go on to accuse me of thinking that women have it better just because I pointed out blatant sexism with hard evidence of which you have none. 

I'll ask you one more time, have you actually listened to the bloody thing because it seems to me that YOU are the very type of person that I'm on about in my post. The kind that labels any criticism of something that's centred around women as an agenda against the females. 

No no, you want to know what's Bullshit? Every single thing you've said because you clearly have no idea what I'm on about. Most here have had a listen. If you did  you would've known that the prison isn't hypothetical. 

So you're laughing at the fact that I'm irked a bit about women getting preferential treatment in regards to prison and rehabilitation yeah?

&gt;The __Helicarrier__, a [fictional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiction) [flying aircraft carrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_aircraft_carrier), is the [signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signature_weapon) [capital ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_ship) of the fictional intelligence/defense agency [S.H.I.E.L.D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.), usually shown in [Marvel Comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics)-published [comic book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book) magazines.

&gt;Originally designed by [Jack Kirby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Kirby) for the *Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.* serial in *[Strange Tales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Tales)* #135 (August 1965), the Helicarrier concept has survived multiple redesigns while rarely straying from its originally depicted role as a mobile headquarters of S.H.I.E.L.D. until recent years.

false,Razed812,logo,,"We have a spending cap of 60m this season. Not only did we spend semi-frugally, but with the money we made from sales (counting Negredo) we broke about even and are quite free to play around with those 60m come January, and that's not including any money we might make from Guidetti, Sinclair, Nastasic or even from selling Yaya if it happens. I might be wrong, but I believe that this was the point of making all those sales in the summer, especially the Negredo deal.

Seeing as the sanctions are removed next summer, I'd say we were preparing ourselves for a bit of January spending with all the deals we made in the summer.

Pogba is pretty much off the cards and Pjanic, while being a top player, is definitely not 60m rated. I don't see a reason why he wouldn't be a prime target when the club decides to go hunting for a central midfielder.

No matter what happens with Yaya, I'd say we might be in for a very interesting January window, at least.",0,1416296334,null,0,false,0,cm5t0ps,t3_2mgd45,t1_cm5t0ps,t1_cm3xxfu,null,1425969619,1,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,1

Very happy that the UK has their own cigar page now.  

Yes, I have smoked a couple of the Flor de las Antilles.  They are pretty good smokes.  Mild-medium in strength.  I found the last one I had a bit on the mild side but I would definitely add it to my list if I was picking up a selection of sticks. 

Let me know what you think of it when you get around to enjoying it.
