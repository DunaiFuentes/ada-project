true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"I'm still not sure what you mean by multiculturalism rollback? Is making the UK a less multicultural place an actual UKIP policy? 

&gt; You also seem to believe that there is a big majority of people who don't see the main parties lies and mistruths. There is a major amount of apathy because British politics is really bad. I can't argue against that, because it is. I just don't think ukip can or will provide any answers to that.

Most people probably do understand that the major parties are lying to them, and maybe that makes them more apathetic towards voting, but that doesn't do any harm to the major parties. It makes things easier for them, less people to convince to vote for them. 

The difference between UKIP and the major parties is that UKIP are not lying to anyone. If they were lying, would they tell lies that make half of the population hate them? Of course not. UKIP is honest about what it wants, and if you actually listen to their policies, they are no worse than what Labour or the Tories want. UKIPs policies about limiting immigration are no worse than wanting to privatise the NHS or make the cost of investing in the UK lower by suppressing wages. 

The only difference is that UKIP is honest about what it wants. They could lie to you, pretend to be something they are not, and then only reveal themselves when they get into power like the others do. It would make things a lot easier for them. The Tories never told anyone they were going to privatise the NHS, they just did it, Labour went to war, killed hundreds of thousands without the mandate of the British people, and they've been forgiven because they never admitted what they did, and now people are going to fall for it all over again.  UKIP does what it says it will do, honesty is a trate severely lacking in politics, and whatever you think about their actual policies, they deserve praise for that. 

&gt;There is nothing stopping you for sharing your house with five of your mates in Germany....

Yes there is, there are hundreds of building regulations and standards that have to be met. having [13 men](http://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/news/local-news/thirteen-suspected-illegal-immigrants-found-7338751)	 sleeping on mattresses in one house would not meet these regulations, neither would having [hundreds of people](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2362393/Inside-migrant-Shed-City-Immigrants-living-cramped-illegally-built-garden-sheds.html) living in sheds in back gardens. Its a [major problem](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/major-clampdown-launched-on-beds-in-sheds) that the government is struggling to deal with. 

Everyone in this country has the right to work hard, get a job and provide for their family. Its not a social choice, its a human right. Why is it fair for a family supported by a plumber or a builder, that he can be undercut by a man illegally paying next to no rent, and sending the money he makes back to his family in Europe, where they can get a higher standard of living than the UK builder would ever be able to provide for his family? 

The sad thing is you are playing right into the hands of big businesses, and their government friends. Our standard of living should be increasing, not decreasing, and yet that is exactly what is happening, thanks in part to this kind of wage suppression. Your statement:

&gt;We live in a capitalist country, you are rewarded based upon how much you can earn and how efficiently you can do that. 

Is exactly how big businesses justify cutting peoples wages and making them work longer hours. Not only should our standard of living be increasing, but so should that of the people of places like Romania. But the brain drain of skilled workers from those countries is making life more difficult there as well. It is a lose lose situation for everyone except the rich and powerful, and your position only encourages that. 

&gt;Is it unfair that lots of people went to Spain and Germany in the 80's in large groups to make money and send it home

It probably was unfair, and just because those countries were too foolish not do do anything about it then, doesn't mean we should do the same.

&gt;Hell, a lot of those arrested are arrested for begging for friggen sake.

Have you met any Romanian beggars? Often they are old women or young children, forced to beg for criminal gangs. I was out a couple of weeks ago outside a club at about 2 in the morning on a Friday night, and a little 8 year old Romanian girl was there selling flowers with an old woman. What the fuck was a child doing outside a club at that time of night? she should be in bed at home. Do you really expect me to have sympathy for the people who forced her to do that? Your own liberal agenda is blinding you from the harsh reality of the situation. I'm glad that these people are arrested for begging. I hope they are deported, I hope that the children involved are taken from their families and put into care and are looked after. I have no sympathy for anyone who would put a child through that.

true,Alwaysfair,null,null,"&gt;For me, the most interesting element would be the role of the subcontinent. I'm assuming the federalised BE would be a democracy. If this were the case I think independence moves from the likes of India would be effectively thwarted, as the Indians with their large population/voter base would effectively gain a metric fuckton of power. I'm not certain this would lead to exclusively Indian leaders, but it would certainly be a very good thing for the subcontinent. I think in the short term, the developed segments of the empire would suffer as their resources would be diverted to poorer areas with large population bases. I think that in the longer term, though, like present day or in the near future, the benefits would be enormous. Forget America as the global hegemon, you'd be looking at a developed, well educated India with 1 billion people, along with hundreds of millions from the rest of the empire. We're talking near-unimaginable production capacity, global military reach, all the bells and whistles. China would be irrelevant and its rise would seem insignificant to what India would have been able to achieve after using its newfound political power to launch itself into a fully developed, industrialized state with British, Canadian, and Australian resources backing up. The US would find its culture-export business faced with a good deal of competition. I imagine british-style humour with a few more indian actors would be the global norm rather than all these superhero movies, romances, and buddy comedies. Immigration between the various parts of the empire would likely be both easier and more common. I can imagine many Indians finding themselves with the capacity and desire to emigrate to Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Canada and the like. These areas would look a lot browner than they do at the moment, and the increased population would disperse the India-centric political power back to the other colonies.
TL;DR: India bosses it up. Short term pain for developed portions of the empire would be matched by enormous long-term net gain across the board.

Right, because it has never been done before on a large scale and examined after extended periods of time, of course there is no evidence. What there are is arguments on both sides.

As things stand now in both jurisdictions, it just couldn't work. I believe that for a united Ireland to work, it has to work for everyone, meaning that things island-wide would have to be rethought and reviewed to fit the new system. A federal-type government based in the 4 historical provinces might be ideal, meaning that traditionally unionist areas in the northeast would not necessarily lose any political representation (rather possibly gain more power as a larger entity in Ireland rather than a small part of the UK). 

As a nationalist, I also believe unionists should be the number 1 priority group in the North to be consulted about their views and opinions on the possibilities of a united Ireland, because it would be paramount that unionists would be able to continue to promote their sense of historical Britishness comfortably in a new modern Ireland. As has been justly pointed out on this sub before, Orangeism is as inherently Irish as fiddly-dee music and Guinness; it all happened on this island and should be included and celebrated as historically significant and valuable. Without the support of unionists and their vote of confidence, it will not happen. It would be nice to hear some thoughts from the Dublin government about this, actually.

A new all-Ireland health service could be created, as it's actually one of the top things, if not the #1 thing, I hear nationalists say puts them off the idea of joining the current Republic and losing the benefits of the UK NHS, and I agree too. 

If years of careful and respectful planning, consulting and reviewing could be put in by Dublin, Belfast and London, and if the population on both sides of the border could feel confident in the merits of a new all-island system, I think a united Ireland could work, but as it stands now we're a long, long way away from a majority yes vote.",0,1408460902,null,0,1408462086,0,cjul7am,t3_2dzg59,t1_cjul7am,t3_2dzg59,null,1435318334,14,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,14

Scotland is a special case because it doesn't have a land border with another Schengen country. I think it's safe to assume that realpolitik will govern this resolution of this particular issue.

&gt;
&gt;Greggs was founded by John Gregg as a Tyneside bakery in 1939. It opened its first shop in Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne in 1951 which was a good place to begin as it was a poor working class city at the time, inhabited by one of the thickest breeds of Englishmen, the Geordies. 
&gt;Since its humble beginnings Greggs has expanded its operations to over 1,400 stores in shit towns and crummy council estates all over the UK, its heartland is still the North-East, but it also has a strong presence in Yorkshire, Scotland, Wales and the Midlands. It now spreads over the country like rot on an animal carcass, bringing lines of  pregnant 16 year olds and benefit cheats in its wake.

Wow.

No legitimate source would ever claim that cannabis is ""as harmless as water"", there are very well documented negative effects (triggering latent mental health issues, reduced motivation, anxiety issues, depression etc).

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; Schengen is a mandatory requirement for any new member of the EU. Sure perhaps Scotland can negotiate an exception. But that is a complete unknown at this point.

It is an unknown, but on the other hand consider that Ireland also has an opt-out - despite being slightly smaller in both population and GDP to Scotland.

IMO the EU plays a long game. Their goal is to bring countries closer together, not to set arbitrary hurdles, and they know perfectly well that the way to get there is to make the process as smooth as possible (look at the way the UK's rebate is being slowly wound down).

Given that, what serves the EU's overall purposes better? Scotland can't simply demand it, but given that it would make no difference to today's situation for anyone else then I find it hard to see that it'd be a major sticking point (particularly given some of David Cameron's [recent issues](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jun/25/defeat-looms-cameron-juncker-european-commission-presidency) with other leaders).

Gerrard is just as bad. There is a runner right in front of him making a dash for the box in full view of the Southampton player with the ball - a clear signal to hold and pass. Who does Gerrard think will pick this player up? Lucas is facing the other way, the runner is already behind him.

We can argue all we want that Lucas has lost his man, we can even agree that this is the case. But that's in the past by this stage and he can get a bollocking off Gerrard in ten seconds time - AFTER SG has cleaned up the mess first.

If you hire a competent sysadmin to run that one Linux machine with obsolete software - you have EOL support by definition. If you have a highly skilled DevOps then they could probably upgrade the machine and backport legacy dependencies, create a symlink to the older versions of files. Heck you could even chroot the whole thing and run it inside a more secure and up to date system - all for normal operating cost without spending cash with the vendor for extended support.

If the problem lies with an undocumented application - well the question becomes who owns the application? *Your company* is the vendor - it was their responsibility to see that it was properly supported - this would be the same issue no matter what the platform is... (and the same goes if the application was built with open source technology. You might have a chance of hiring another competent developer to come along and fix/upgrade/document it - without concern for licensing or support costs).

If you're not aware, a conditional discharge is where there is no punishment unless the offender offends again. So he didn't even suffer for it. 

Quite distant from your summing up of it. No-one has ever been imprisoned under the Weights and Measures Acts for displaying measurements in metric.

The two imprisonment sentences prescribed by the act are:

1) Violation of Section 64 or 79(7) - when a Weights and Measures inspector divulges trade secrets or other sensitive information to people who shouldn't have access to it that he obtained in his work = up to two years' imprisonment.

2) Violation of Section 17(3), 20(3)(b) - committing fraud through use of weighing or measuring equipment - or Sections 50 (2), (3) or (4) - failure to keep records of conformity with weights and measures law, forging such conformity records and passing them off as genuine, or altering such records with intent to deceive - = up to six months' imprisonment.

true,Smack_OP_Hard,null,null,"&gt; I'm still not sure what you mean by multiculturalism rollback? Is making the UK a less multicultural place an actual UKIP policy? 

You tell me. Those are the exact words UKIP use. Ask them.

&gt; The only difference is that UKIP is honest about what it wants

Yeah, massive tax cuts for everybody WHILE building a larger military. Somehow this is all going to be paid for by... spending lots of money getting rid of immigrants. If their honesty only extends to being against Romanians, they really need to think about everything else a little harder.

&gt; Yes there is, there are hundreds of building regulations and standards that have to be met. having 13 men[1] sleeping on mattresses in one house would not meet these regulations, neither would having hundreds of people[2] living in sheds in back gardens. Its a major problem[3] that the government is struggling to deal with. 

You're saying it like it's something they're allowed to do. It's illegal and they should be arrested for it. But 200,000 Romanians are not living like that. Those that are don't have proper jobs. But hell, I could find more that aren't immigrants that skim money off the top from every industry, that doesn't mean everyone is doing it or that it's an OK and common thing to do. Arguing about a fraction of a minority doing something which the police is trying to deal with doesn't help UKIPs cause, only creates general anger and fear. Be angry at the criminal groups or the police, not magically pretend UKIP can do anything more about it.

&gt; undercut by a man illegally paying next to no rent, and sending the money he makes back to his family in Europe, where they can get a higher standard of living than the UK builder would ever be able to provide for his family? 

Again, you're claiming this is a widespread problem caused by foreign workers. The great majority of the ~200,000 EU migrants from May this year (A small fraction, 13,000 being Romanian) are reported as being in work legally. Those are the ones that we can only talk about politically since those are the numbers we control and track. They don't live in the back of a shed of somebodies garden.

It doesn't matter what person or government is involved, anyone who sneaks over and lives in a shed with 20 other guys is illegal. That has zero to do with UKIP's arguments about the EU, but about the Home Office and police failure to deal with criminals. The EU does not say that we can't arrest criminals breaking the law.

http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/migration1/migration-statistics-quarterly-report/may-2014/msqr-may-2014.html

&gt; It is a lose lose situation for everyone except the rich and powerful, and your position only encourages that. 

Again, if this is your major gripe with the country, UKIP are not the people you want to have your back. Stopping more migrants working legally won't solve this problem - it needs a labor law reform to make bosses pay. UKIP are angry Tories, they have no policies on making British people richer, nor any way of paying for it except 'Well.. less foreigners...?', except foreigners don't pay the wage packets in your pocket, employers do. Claiming that cheap labor is affecting your wage packet is just an excuse - they're simply keeping the profit to themselves while not paying taxes.

&gt; Your own liberal agenda 

I don't understand how thinking UKIP are full of bullshit with no policies other than 'fuck Romanians' is a liberal agenda? Do you know what a liberal is? Why do you think I am one? Is anyone who attacks the half-truths UKIP spew a liberal all of a sudden, or 'one of them from those other parties'? Do you even know how much bullshit the newspapers like the Daily Mail, Sun and the Express publish every day that has zero facts and figures, and as soon as somebody challenges them, we're liberal dogooders? I mean, the biggest UKIP supports are from ESSEX for god sake, the region with the least immigrants in the country.

But don't worry, I'm still waiting for those 1-2 million Romanians to turn up any second now.

She's not even saying that the people in question are racist. She starts by saying ""you might think that...."" and the video is crudely edited to cut off the end of the sentence (everything about her tone and her breathing suggests that the sentence is not finished) where she presumably states that it is not the case. I haven't seen the full unedited clip, but I think we can safely assume that if she had gone on to say that such opinions were correct (i.e., ""and you'd be right, they're all big bloody racists"") that would have been left in and repeated 9 times. 

Specifying the race of a group of people is not racist. Presenting a potential negative stereotype is not racist in itself. What matters is what comes after that and that has been conveniently left out. 

Here's an example:

""You might think that all people of Middle Eastern origin are terrorists, **and so do I**.

vs

""You might think that all people of Middle Eastern origin are terrorists, **but you'd be a twat because obviously they are a diverse group of people""**""

See how context is important? And context is exactly what has been removed, leaving something that isn't even racist out of context.

Scotland would, like all new members, have to commit to joining the Euro. But the timetable for doing so is completely under Scotland's control - members can not be forced to adopt it.

Its economy was set back years in a deliberate move in order to benefit the UK's industry over India's. Imports of certain fabrics from India were banned because they were better quality and undercutting factories back home. The government was also quite stand-offish from internal affairs that weren't linked to economics. Queen Victoria put an end to a lot meddling in Indian domestic issues after the mutinies in India. Britain didn't want the sort of integration this what if story is hinting towards. India was great if you were an upper class person. You could move over there and live on a big estate with loads of locals made to look after your every whim.

The yanks have been doing it for years (to much lower safety standards that we demand) and we have been doing it ourselves in the North Sea for years - the process and its potential environmental impact is very well known. 

That actually brings me to one of the ironies here: Offshore deep sea oil drilling such as the type we do in the North Sea all the time is WAY more likely to lead to a large-scale environmental incident than on-shore fracking, and yet the opposition to this is non-existent.

Got a source for ""the extraction method still doesn't make it any cheaper than alternative methods such as biogas."" because everything I've read says that the impact it has made to the US economy has been fucking huge. Energy is now so cheap manufacturing is returning from China! There's a damn good reason politicians are determined to push on with fracking despite public opposition.

The tax has been lowered to stimulate investment, because at this stage investing in the UK shale industry is a very risky bet for an investor to make. We don't even know if the shale the UK sits on is ""frackable"", and they will have to spend many millions to find out. We need to incentivise them to do that somehow.

That’s the obvious and sensible solution. Even if the Scottish Government fails in its argument that Scotland is a continuing member of the EU, and has to renegotiate entry, we could **expect** the support of the UK and Irish governments in asking for the UK opt-out from Schengen to be extended, and we could **expect** the EU to recognise the realities on the ground. **If sanity and pragmatism prevails** – and it usually does in the end – nothing will change.

I find this part hilarious:

&gt;I trust you see my point.

Firstly, I would use a blog whose writer doesn't even know what transphobia is and quotes without citing a source as proof of anything.

Secondly, while it is true that there are some extreme viewpoints within the movement, these are outweighed by several orders of magnitude by well thought-out viewpoints and academic studies. Meanwhile, I have yet to see a single peer-reviewed academic paper on the subject of men's rights.

Ultimately, you can try to make as many equivalences between the movements as you like but they simply aren't reflected by reality.

When we were in the thick of the title challenge last season my only qualm with Brendan's management was that I thought he was trying to bed Sakho into the side too forcefully. He likes big commanding presences in defence and for all Agger's classiness on the ball, he is not that. When Agger took a knock Sakho came in and Rodgers never looked back. It makes sense too - the money we dropped on him and his performances for France indicate he is the guy we want to roll with as a cornerstone in our defence for a long time. I thought our defence could have used Agger when we were reaching the back end of the season and it was no coincidence that most of our cleansheets coincided with his presence in the lineup. But Rodgers, for the sake of the future, put his faith in Sakho. 

Rodgers has never favoured playing two left-footed players in centre-back.  We've just paid close to £20m on Lovren. Rodgers has said he sees him as a commanding presence, quality on the ball, and above all a vocal leader - something he felt that we sorely lack in the back. He didn't even have a full preseason with us and yet he was started on the opening day. That's a big sign of his faith in him. It's going to be Lovren and Sakho. And I definitely think as Sakho develops and really settles into the country and learns the language his performances will mimic those of his for France. 

It's the way forward. Brendan sees it that way. And I certainly agree. ",0,1408467969,null,0,false,0,cjup7kf,t3_2dz36d,t1_cjup7kf,t3_2dz36d,null,1435320503,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Well I wouldn't use a deceased ex-politician from 25 years ago to describe the goals of the modern MRM movement but there you go.

&gt;Meanwhile, I have yet to see a single peer-reviewed academic paper on the subject of men's rights.

Then you haven't even taken 5 seconds to google some because plenty exist. Although, interestingly, I do think it's really interesting how a common attack levelled against the MRM is that it's not legitimate because it's in a fairly fledging stage, as if no movement can ever be in a growth stage, either it's established or it's nothing.

&gt;One is the result of centuries of oppression and marginalisation within society while the other is a reaction to the dominant position they hold in society being slowly eroded as we progress towards equality and has more in common with the white rights movement than any legitimate civil rights movement.

This is the thing that really bothers me....I can see the value in Townsend (whether you believe it or not)...English, still young, two-footed, very athletic...you can see the appeal that a player like Townsend would have for numerous managers in the PL...many managers would like to think that they could coach the decision making with him (whether true or not is not the point).....it means in truth we can really drive the price on him, he has a market.

But when looking at our squad Townsend is clearly a step up from Lennon (as loyal a servant as he has been to the squad these years)....but because of contracts and talent we would be potentially forced to sell Townsend (who brings more to the squad) and sit on Lennon.

I believe Depay would be a great signing for us but i don't know that he would be an immediate impact that would start every match for us from game 1....Depay and Townsend (with Chadli in the mix across the front 3) i think gives us more versatility and a better rotation as well as allowing us to dictate Townsend's price in the future.  

Lennon in that mix doesn't strengthen the rotation and his value isn't going to improve (he still can't cross, create or shoot) as he continues to age.

Feels like we would be making a sale because our hands were tied not because it was the best decision for the squad.",0,1408468986,null,0,false,0,cjupspu,t3_2dzpor,t1_cjupspu,t1_cjupbe3,null,1435321101,6,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,6

I would say however, anxiety and depression are (if dianoised especially) something the DCA should be considering here. £5 a month will be considered as token payments currently and not really addressing the debt, and if he does suffer from those things could have an impact on the way this debt should be addressed.

My first advice for him, would to contact some debt charities to talk things over, one being stepchange - telephone number 0800 138 1111, and theres also the national debt helpline - telephone number 0808 808 4000. I'd certainly suggest giving these a call if he has other debts as well. 


In relation to the credit rating, theres no saying what could have happened with that. Past Due Credit have no legal footing on your friends credit file as they are just a third party in all this. However Scottish Power may have placed something on there, if there is real concern, there is a free service call Noddle on the internet that gives access to a free but basic credit file, it might be showing on there. The thing is with the credit files, is that there are 3 credit refernce agencies in the UK. Equifax, Experian and also Callcredit. The original creditoe (scottish power in this case) dont need to advise any of them if there is an unresolved matter, however at the same time they can. Theres no definative ""Yes this is definately going to show on your credit file"". More so, if it is showing on the credit file, it will be showing as unsatisfied until the balance is cleared anyway, so at £5 a month this could take a long time.

That's what the pool is for, to redistribute students if too many who are good enough apply to one college over another. Obviously in practice different colleges have different interviewers who have different standards etc., so this may not actually be the case. However, do not just assume that getting into Trinity is harder.

2) Are you sure you actually like Trinity? My dad was a PhD student there and so, for me, Trinity seemed like an obvious choice. I went to an open day and hated it; it was too touristy/snobbish for my liking. I also have friends at Trinity who are very happy with their college. I would recommend visiting (if you haven't already) to get a feel for the place, and try to imagine yourself actually living there. Would it feel like home?

I enjoyed the World Cup a lot, so I got out of that with a lot of confidence. I came back to Chelsea, and obviously had a very short break. I was only two and a half weeks at the ocean and could relax. But from then zero to 100 – I am hungry, I want to achieve something with Chelsea. I want to win titles with Chelsea so I have worked hard these two weeks. I worked a lot — extra for me as well. The only thing I can do is to work and give everything to be 100 per cent in the games.  At Burnley I think it was a good start for me, but of course we can be better. And when I am 100 per cent fit, there will be more. I think even when I played last season it was good because I scored a few goals and played in some big matches. But of course I feel more comfortable in the team. Even after the World Cup I want to step up, I want to have the ball, I want to play, I want to run. I think you can see it on the pitch that it’s a different game and I enjoy playing like this.

Oscar covering for Fabregas is a given--his workrate and defensive tracking is partially why Jose rates him so highly. Oscar can cover Fabregas if he decides to push up and play more offensively, but there were many times yesterday where both were pushed up with Matic being the only midfielder playing the defensive role. 

In a perfect world, Oscar knows when Fabregas is pushing forward and has the time to drop in and cover for him--but there were many times where Oscar didn't have time to track back and Burnley had found space in between Matic and the defense.

&gt; We have too many quality creative players to waste them by leaving six back to defend.

It's not about sitting back though--it's about keeping the formation. If one player is not playing his role then there is instant imbalance as other players need to try to cover two positions. One of the reasons Mourinho is the best defensive manager in the world is because how highly he stresses the importance of maintaining shape--he obviously plans for certain players having a more roaming role at certain points but always demands they are responsible defensively (see Hazard v Atletico last year).",0,1408470689,null,0,false,0,cjuqsfb,t3_2dza8d,t1_cjuqsfb,t1_cjuq7ae,null,1435321722,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

1) Financially: it's a lot of money, and I wouldn't personally pay it. I don't know your financial situation, so I can't really comment. Just be very aware that it is very possible that you will spend £7k and then not get in. Are you ok with that?

2) Ethically: this company (and their website) just rubs me the wrong way, and it all seems.. wrong.. to me. But, then again, I went to a private secondary school so I shouldn't be too quick to judge.

3) Is it in your interests?: Say you (at the moment) wouldn't get in, but with these people's coaching you do get in. Do you actualy belong? I don't mean that in a snobbish way, but in a very practical sense of ""will you cope"". The interviews are aimed at people who do not have any form of coaching. The interviewers are trying to figure out if you would fit into Cambridge and succeed and thrive. ""Cheating"" this process is not worth it if you don't belong. Cambridge is very very hard and being unhappy for 3 years and getting a low 2.ii is NOT worth the name on your degree. Now, I don't know you at all, and maybe you completely do belong and would flourish here, but it's something worth thinking about. There are many people here who would have been much better off at Bristol/Manchester/Durham where they would have excelled rather than scraped through. I appreciate that it's very hard/impossible to know whether you are ""good enough"" to flourish, so I guess it comes down to your gut instinct.

You never actually see him put it on or open it. The scene cuts out and goes to the son thanking the household gods (Donna and Ten). 

I tried to get a good screen shot off of netflix, but it didn't work out as well as I'd hoped. [image 1](http://i.imgur.com/pvGUZe1.jpg) [Image 2](http://i.imgur.com/yZYT5o2.jpg) He spends a good minute fiddling with it because he can't seem to work out how to open it. 

It's a stretch, but he talks about how Egyptians love their scarabs (referring to the design on the clasp)... This could be manipulated into a nod to River or Nefertiti. 

(Sorry, confused this with a rumor I guess...) The Master is suppose to be coming back... so another theory is that maybe he trapped the doctor within the pocketwatch, took him in the TARDIS to Pompeii, and left him there to die.

I guess my previous feeling was that, since Trinity was a more oversubscribed college, and had such a reputation, that it could afford to have standards slightly higher than 'Cambridge standard', and thus would be more difficult, and make it harder to get into Cambridge without being pooled. I now feel that my thinking was somewhat flawed, but there is still that little voice in the back of my head.

I will be honest and say I am not *sure* I like Trinity. Though I have visited Cambridge twice, neither time did I visit a college. I will be attending a summer school at Cambridge this summer, where I think we'll have the opportunity to look around some of the colleges, so I'll make sure to do this. I've been told that college choice is not so important, and somewhat arbitrary, so choosing one because I liked the name/history sounded quite nice to me, but I agree that I should probably have a look before I rush into anything.

I'm not really sure what preparing for interview entails. I'm currently reading Polya's ""How to solve it"", but I'm not sure what else I could be doing, apart from actual interview practice, which I will ask my teachers about when the school term starts again. Do you have any interview preparation tips apart from ""make sure you know everything on your personal statement"" and ""make sure you know your A-level work""? Any advice would be much appreciated.

I'll make the strong assumption you aren't at Trinity. Would you say that the NatScis at Trinity tend to have higher UMS averages or more 'achievements', or that they are about the same as every other college?

true,Mercc96,eng-kent,Kent,"&gt; For example. A study published in the British Medical Journal found that one in ten people who used cannabis before the age of 15 developed schizophrenia by the age of 26. This is compared to three per cent of teenagers who did not use the drug.

&gt;http://www.bmj.com/content/325/7374/1212.full.pdf+html[1]

&gt;I would say studies like that, of which there are many, provide more than enough reason to 'think of the children', as you put it. Why would you not spend time discussing the effects of drugs legalisation on the age group for whom they are most dangerous?



This study was completed in 2002, the [debate](http://www.leafly.com/%28F%28KYwuC81WNyz_X5deaeAAO2FQ8DXdpp-OkLXsdXyQxwo9ebGeVYGeb5pkvEemKBNwYpObx-iRN0Zo4r7mgtfBN7Xa0scxm6LGt5e8ZnpP9_t8PYaLib80AzyqBm21Rb_-wYpYfmhCHc6Q9gIa0%29%29/news/medical/cannabis-and-schizophrenia-the-current-debates) between the relationship between schizophrenia and cannabis has changed since then.

Recent studies from [Harvard](http://psychcentral.com/news/2013/12/10/harvard-marijuana-doesnt-cause-schizophrenia/63148.html) have suggested that cannabis doesn't cause schizophrenia.  It is now suggested that people with a genetic predisposition for schizophrenia are more likely to have used cannabis (and other drugs) not the other way around , it is still unclear whether cannabis can actually trigger schizophrenia, though it can certainly trigger physcosis. 

[Economist article](http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21605870-correlation-not-necessarily-causation-puff-logic)

[ Reuters] (http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/24/us-health-cannabis-idUSKBN0EZ0NC20140624)

Interestingly a recent [study](http://www.schres-journal.com/article/S0920-9964%2814%2900193-5/abstract)  also suggested that alcohol was actually more likely to be the culprit behind physcosis in the mentally ill  - “Results revealed that low use of alcohol, but neither cannabis use nor tobacco use at baseline, contributed to the prediction of psychosis in the clinical high risk sample,” wrote Jean Addington, PhD of the University of Calgary, the study’s lead author.""

There is also a [theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia_and_smoking)  that tobacco can play a role in a person developing schizophrenia...

""Studies across 20 countries show a strong association between schizophrenia and smoking. For example, in the United States, 80% or more of people with schizophrenia smoke, compared to 20% of the general population in 2006.""

Though it is well established that smoking is more prevalent among people with schizophrenia than the general population as well as those with other psychiatric diagnoses, there is currently no definitive explanation for this difference. Many social, psychological, and biological explanations have been proposed, but today research focuses on neurobiology.""

Either way keeping cannabis illegal and unregulated is not going to stop young people from smoking it and potentially developing schizophrenia if they are predisposed to it.

The transition may not be AS quick as I'd like to believe, but up until Klinsmann took over, if you were the best player on your youth club in the USA you played Center Mid. No question. 100% of the time.

Klinsmann put a huge emphasis on the growth and development of youth-- finding what players are suited to play where. He basically turned the US youth system on its head by emphasizing putting the proper players in the proper position from an early age. He did a lot of similar things in Germany and now the German team is stacked (and with more youth coming).

The results are starting to really show. The youth teams are getting better and better, and learning to become experts at their roles from a young age. And they're playing together at a younger age because they're getting playing time at proper positions.

...Also, Zelalem turned down a cap with the DFB (not their youth, their full team). He did it because since he doesn't have US citizenship yet, it would mean he couldn't do a one-time switch. If he's committed to Germany, he doesn't turn down that opportunity. Right now his dad is attempting to get citizenship, which means that Zelalem would automatically become a US citizen (because he's under 18).

true,ddosn,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;Britain treated India quite badly when it was in the empire.

There were some bumps, but overall, British rule was a benefit to India.

&gt;Its economy was set back years in a deliberate move in order to benefit the UK's industry over India's.

Myth. India's cottage industry collapsed because it couldn't compete with the British mass production. The British made *no moves* to actively dismantle India's industry. It just happened because of basic economics.

Hand made, long-to-make artisan goods have no chance against mass produced goods.

&gt;Imports of certain fabrics from India were banned because they were better quality and undercutting factories back home.

Myth. Whilst they were better quality, they were not that much better than the British goods. However, undercutting? Hell no. Hand made goods were far more expensive than mass produced goods. Britain supplied the mass produced goods, which undercut the Indian industry.

&gt;Britain didn't want the sort of integration this what if story is hinting towards. 

Except it did. During the late 1800's, there was another shift in politics from holding an empire to transforming it into a federation of equal nations, henceforth known as the Commonwealth. Thats why the Commonwealth exists in the first place.

&gt;You could move over there and live on a big estate with loads of locals made to look after your every whim.

The locals werent 'made' to do anything. Slavery was illegal. They were employed (on good salaries, which they would not have gotten doing the same job in an Indian princes palace) to fulfill those roles.

However it had numerous hurdles to get over and obviously the plan was not realised, with the final straw after 1918 when the dominions began asking for further devolution.

A significant problem was India, which had a massive population compared to the rest of the Empire. It would become the Indian Federation! Of course there was some racism too, I believe the Australians did not like the idea of total freedom of movement from Pacific islands for example.

One solution to all of this was an ""Anglo"" Union - CANZUK, or Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the UK. This made sense since the countries were largely made up of similar peoples and the Empire could be kept running as it was. There are still people who advocate this today.

I'm certainly not denying there were positive things about British rule in India, but there were many problems. For one, India probably wouldn't have such a vast and quite good railway network without having been a colony and that is currently an enormous asset to them. 

India's economy was growing at an average of 0.9% per year from 1900 to 1947. After independence it managed around 3.5% growth until 1980, before reaching 5% and even 7% in 2000. Per capita this is 0.1% under colonial rule but over 1%, increasing to 6%, as an independent nation.

Adam Smith wrote about India (or Bengal mostly) in the Wealth of Nations, describing it as one of the most prosperous countries in the world with very advanced trading.  Yet after independence it was one of the poorest. It never really industrialised under British rule. India's last big famine was in 1943, yet millions died in famine while India was under British rule.

&gt; Myth. India's cottage industry collapsed because it couldn't compete with the British mass production. The British made no moves to actively dismantle India's industry. It just happened because of basic economics.

So why did the government ban and impose huge tariffs the import of calico? The title of the 1721 act is quite self-explanatory: ""An act to preserve and encourage the woollen and silk manufactures of this kingdom"". India could produce these things for less than British factories could, and the East India Company was still making money after transporting it back. Daniel Defoe wrote: ""The prohibiting the importation of East-India printed calicoes and silks, in the year 1701, sensibly restored and recovered the weavers who at that time were in a most miserable ruined condition"".

Admittedly all these textiles weren't just coming from India. But a hell of a lot of it was. This all started in the years before the East India Company established company rule but obviously still had a big trading presence.

British weavers couldn't compete with Indian textiles. Yes, they were being undercut in many areas.

&gt; The locals werent 'made' to do anything. Slavery was illegal. They were employed (on good salaries, which they would have gotten doing the same job in an Indian princes palace) to fulfill those roles.

I've been working in my current job for six months.

In that time, I have worked on web apps that we've just started using and ones we've been using for up to a year. Off the top of my head, we have:

 - An application that depends on an ActiveX control. The only way to install this is with an installer provided by the application supplier; this installer cannot be automated. Discussion with the supplier reveals that this is by design; how one pushes the control out to a hundred PCs is honestly not something that ever crossed their mind. Yes, this honestly means we get help desk tickets to install a freaking web application.
 - An application that depends on no fewer than four different ActiveX controls and IE10. One of these can be installed on the fly if you make significant changes through Group Policy; one of the controls requires an installer that can be automated, one will attempt to install on the fly but invariably balls up. This balls up can be corrected quite easily in a batch file. I forget how the fourth plugin works.
 - An application - newly released by the vendor, I might add - that depends on IE9.

* Arena: fairly standard, most popular for cheesy Tuesdays, big dance floor. Will still be busy most nights, and Friday is Asian night for some reason. People at arena are often singing along to Barbie Girl or drinking Jaegerbombs.

* Timepiece: Lots of different parts, has a courtyard and a bar downstairs that you can turn up to earlier for a few drinks. Also a couple of other bars/pubs attached directly to it where you can wait for entry later on. Most popular on Wednesdays (Sports night, everyone wears chinos, a shirt, and tie), and Fridays. People at timepiece often can't stand up.

* Cavern: In some old vaults underground, small and expensive but plays much better music and often has live bands. You need to go with a good group of people because you are less likely to bump into others. It's also one of the few clubs in town that students go to on a Saturday. People at cavern are hipsters.

* Mosaic: Odd layout, and generally popular with those in Birks or Holland halls as it is nearer that end of town. The whole place is a bit cramped in my opinion. People at Mosaic are often ordering bottles of grey goose and crates of VKs.

* Cellar Door: Similar to cavern, but a bit of trek to get to it (down by the quay). Popular on Tuesdays and I think DnB soc do some stuff there. People at Cellar Door are often slightly too old and on drugs.

* The Lemon Grove aka. ""The Lemmy"": The on-campus nightclub, popular on Saturdays. So bad it's good. Sometimes. People at the Lemmy are often regretting their decision.

Also, in terms of pubs:

* Firehouse: Near Timepiece, serves the best pizza ever. Full stop. Dinner tray sized, cheap, and delicious. The Firehouse challenge is to eat a whole one and drink a bottle of wine. Also has a huge selection of craft beer and cider (Careful, 8.2% cider that tastes like apple juice is dangerous).

* The Imperial aka. ""The Impy"": A Weatherspoons based in an old coaching inn. Usual prices and range but is a really nice place to hang out for a few hours, has a big garden for when it's sunny.

* The Ram: On campus pub, nothing remarkable. Food, drink, good for lunch.

* The Victoria aka. ""The Vic"": Much smaller than the others, popular with later year students as is next to a lot of their housing.

At present drugs are still, despite this being less and less the case, decently difficult to get hold of. A legalised system would see an explosion in the availability of drugs and with it the risk is run that the use of the hardest drugs (heroin, cocaine) is normalized. It is not going to matter if the drug is legal or not, the effects on people remain the same. Prices would also likely come down, which has a potential negative effect of stoking addiction in itself. 

  I also do not buy into the argument that legalisation would necessarily cause illegal trade to cease. This isn't even the case in the case of alcohol and tobacco right now, and I cannot see how any other substance is likely to be different. All that will likely happen is that the dealers will focus their attentions to underage selling, or undercutting the price of legal suppliers by bypassing such things as income tax, corporation tax or import fees. Some may even go so far as to counterfeit. 

  Plus I find it very difficult to understand how someone can clamour for legalisation and be content to do so when in all likelihood such a trade would likely find itself in the hands of multi-nationals such as British-American Tobacco or Philip Morris whose sole motivation is profit.

true,somethingdifferent34,null,null,"&gt; I don't think there is a single environmentalist protester at a fracking sight suggesting that we drill for more oil.

They don't make up 76% of the population being against/undecided with ""fracking"" though. Wayyyyy less people are against us drilling in the North Sea than ""fracking"" - onshore fracking presumably - which is illogical given the relative risk to the environment. 

&gt; I don't think there is a single environmentalist protester at a fracking sight suggesting that we drill for more oil.

Well that may be your view and honestly I can't say I'm an expert on this topic to be fair, but I have read numerous articles that suggest than the low energy prices have certainly helped return manufacturing to the US and I expect they help consumer demand plenty too.

That Guardian article really doesn't *prove* much about the viability of biogas. If it works, great! But what is clear from the article is that even if every shite taken by man, woman, child and animal countrywide was used to make biogas, it still wouldn't satisfy anywhere NEAR our whole demand for gas. It actually says that they could satisfy half of household heating demand at best. That isn't much if we're going to hit carbon emissions targets by replacing coal power plants with gas. So yeah, I'm all for biogas if it's economically viable... but it has little relevance to whether we should be fracking shale on-shore in the UK because either way we need to get the rest of the gas from somewhere.

&gt;What utter twaddle; taxes only come out of profits there is no reduced risk to a failed investment. The tax is low because they have lobbied for it to be low this is what businesses do to increase profits. When they start generating profits their lobbies and lawyers will only become more profitable. We will not see a penny because this isn't how it works. If they can't do it without the profits going to the UK then what the hell benefit is it to us?

Yes, I understand a business only pays tax on its profits, but what I mean is that you need to provide an incentive for the initial companies that spend hundreds of millions of pounds and accept losses for a 5-10 year period before they're making money - assuming shale turns out as good as is hoped. The first companies to make a success of it will get a few years of low tax earnings before we inevitably crank it up as it becomes an established industry. Just as we have done with the North Sea which has contributed hundreds of billions in tax receipts over the years and has 80% tax on profits from the most established fields. There will also be many thousands of jobs going as part of a successful shale industry, and the companies involved are UK companies some of which are listed on the FTSE. I understand lobbying exists and that companies try to persuade government to have lower taxes and favourable regulation to the best of their ability.

A successful politician can get a well paid job all over the shop after they finish in government - though they won't be too successful if they can't satisfy the public for a while. I don't think they're passing legislation solely because some company tells them to! Though even if you do believe in some sort of conspiracy whereby government has been secretly bought off somehow, remember that the biggest company in UK shale currently is Cuadrilla, which is only worth ~£500 million.",0,1408481799,null,0,false,0,cjux35r,t3_2dxfuw,t1_cjux35r,t1_cjup4sg,null,1435325311,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I would agree with what you've heard that at the end of the day college doesn't matter too much. In terms of the education you're going to get, it really makes no difference. The difference it *does* make is the general feel of the place you're living in. The atmospheres of somewhere like Peterhouse (tiny) and somewhere like St John's (massive) are wildly different. Some people prefer the small community of the former and others the grandeur and anonymity of the latter; it's really down to personal preference. Just remember that you will be living there for 3+ years, and you want to be somewhere where you feel comfortable and at home. I picked my college (Christ's) because of the large garden and pool and because it just felt *right*. Picking somewhere for the name/history is as good a reason as any, as long as you've walked through the grounds and are happy there.

2. Why do you want to study natural sciences? (linked to 1, but also why physics as opposed to history)
3. Why do you want to go to x college? (Less important than 1 or 2)

Make sure you have something vaguely intelligent to answer these 3 questions. I would highly advise you do not rehearse a set speech that you'll give; it is completely obvious that you are reciting something and will not help your cause. Just make sure you've actually thought about these things before the interview!

Like you said, make sure you've read your personal statement &amp; are reasonably comfortable with the course. You will be asked questions by your interviewer that will fall into 3 main categories:

1. Knowledge testing - do you know the physics/chemistry/maths that you have been taught?
2. Inference testing - can you apply something you have been taught to a situation you haven't encountered before?
3. Something-I-can't-find-the-word-for testing - can you solve something you've never thought about before given some new information you've never met before. An example of this (which was in my admissions interview) was being told: here are the pictures of all the molecular orbitals, with +ve shaded black and -ve shaded white. How could they overlap to form bonds? Which of these bonds could rotate? etc.

The most important thing to remember about the interviews is that they are being done by academics who are going to have supervisions with you. They are not evil people looking to catch you out, and in fact they are looking for people they can personally work with. They are not expecting you to instantly know the answers to their questions, and that is not what they are testing. What they want to know is if you can think things through and work things out, specifically in a one-on-one setting (like the interview, and indeed like supervisions). Think out loud, and do not be scared to ask for encouragement. Test ideas out on them. Don't clam up!

Re Trinity UMS: I have no idea I'm afraid. Students at Trinity historically perform better than at other colleges ([see here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tompkins_Table)), and this is most likely due to higher number of applications and therefore higher admissions standards. I would guess (without any evidence) that Trinity pools more people than average.

&gt;

&gt;The __Tompkins Table__ is an annual ranking that lists the [Colleges of the University of Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colleges_of_the_University_of_Cambridge) in order of their undergraduate students' performances in that year's examinations. It was created in 1981 by Peter Tompkins, then a third-year undergraduate [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) student at [Trinity College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Cambridge), who compiles it every year exclusively for the newspaper *[The Independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent)*,  and is not an official [University of Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge) table.

Don't get me wrong, I really do and always have loved him but he doesn't recycle possession well. Retaining the ball isn't enough when you've just killed momentum.

Lucas for me, when it comes to this aspect of his game, has been much slower since returning from injury. I thought he was poor on Sunday and one of the biggest aspects of this was his inability to get the ball out from under his feet quickly.

I think I am more on the obedient end of the spectrum, so you may see others saying it's ok in some circumstances to do some of the things I don't (e.g. red light jump). Hopefully this addresses some of the things you ask.

My approach to cyclings is in three parts: be visible, be predictable, and be considerate.

1. Visible means (a) wear a high-viz jacket day and night over what you're wearing and have a forward white light and rear red light if the light is at all low, and (b) be aware of your position in the road and make sure that cars can see you. Don't attempt any overtake manoeuvres without knowing that you've been seen, as people can do some unexpected things.

2. Predictable means obeying the laws of the road first and foremost. Our whole driving system is remarkably safe in the grand scheme of things given the amount of vehicles on our roads and the speeds they're going at, and that only works on the assumption that there are systems and we follow the rules. Don't jump red lights. Don't jump on and off the pavement; other road users can't tell what you're doing, even if you think it's clear. Where there is a forward reservation for cyclists, use it. Always signal with your arms, consider even pointing forward at crossroads for complete clarity. If you feel there isn't room for someone in a car to overtake you, occupy the middle of the road, otherwise you might be perceived as inviting them to overtake. Taking the middle of the lane gives a clear message. Basically do what you're doing clearly. I stop to let people cross at zebras when they're on the other side - they have right of way.

3. Considerate means realising that while cycling is great and beneficial, it's a relatively new thing in the amounts that it is happening now, and our roads have been developed over the last 150 years to suit cars primarily - and still will. Things will change and cycling will become easier - borough councils are all for this - but it will take time and at the same time motor traffic is still necessary for our economy.

You'll have altercations, that's a part of being on the road. I cycle, I drive and I ride a motorbike, and have had people say all sorts of things to me on my many miles. Sometimes I make mistakes, somethings others make mistakes that affect me. My approach is to have a mind like a goldfish: someone might piss me off, but five seconds later I have to have forgotten about it otherwise it'll build up and affect me personally.

true,MarginOfHeirOre,null,null,"1. When you come to a traffic light or a crossing, down-shift a gear or two. It might not sound like much, but it'll be way easier for you to start back up and you won't annoy the cyclists waiting behind you while you furiously try to accelerate.
2. Look all around you when you're changing directions (this includes full turns and going around vehicles, etc.) including shoulder checking.
3. Please ring your bell or say ""on your left/right"" when passing another cyclist. It's super scary when you're about to make a move and shoulder checking and another cyclist is RIGHT NEXT TO YOU. Don't be that guy.
4. Signal. For the love of all that is holy, signal. Especially if you're riding with other cyclists (but even if you're not).

For your questions:

Do you always stop dead at zebra crossings even if the pedestrians are on the other side of the road? I never run them down, but stopping or slowing depends on how long it takes them to cross. Can I get away with just slowing down/track-standing for a second? Then do that. Is it a granny who should really have a Boy Scout helping her cross? Then stop for sure.

Do you tell off pedestrians or other cyclists when they're being idiots (by your standards) or let it pass? If they are on a Boris bike then I don't even bother. They're not going to listen/care/do anything differently. If someone is being particularly dangerous and I happen to catch up to them then yeah, sure I'll give them a polite ""oh hey, here's what you're actually supposed to do in that situation.""

Do you hop onto the pavement for a few seconds if it'll make your ride quicker and can clearly see no pedestrians? Nope, never. It's just one thing I won't do. It's super dangerous and just because you can't see any pedestrians right now doesn't mean they aren't about to wander out of a gate not expecting to see you/anyone and mow you down.",0,1408483093,null,0,false,0,cjuxrhz,t3_2e0pxw,t1_cjuxrhz,t3_2e0pxw,null,1435325797,5,false,londoncycling,t5_2wcdj,5

To add to what's already been said...

If the weather is good, it's worth getting on a bus and heading into Wivenhoe. There are half a dozen pubs at the 'bottom' end of Wivenhoe by the river, and they are all lovely local pubs. You might get asked to do the Wivenhoe Run, which involves visiting the 10 (?) pubs between Wivenhoe and the University.
If drinking isn't your thing, then Wivenhoe has some nice restaurants. The sort of place that you'd want to take your girlfriend or parents :)

If you head the other way and in to Colchester itself, again get a bus as it's about an hour's walk from the University to the town centre. There are various pubs and bars to suit most tastes; including some chain pubs, pubs with live bands, real ale pubs, etc. There's a few night clubs, but you are better off with Sub Zero for most of your late night drinking needs (at least until the second term). There's a wider range off places to eat out in Colchester, chain restaurants, a few independents, etc. Finally, check out Colchester Arts Centre, it has a lot of decent acts and nights on.

But you can already do that with child benefit. People with 14 kids can do very nicely out of it, but most of us really don't want that life for ourselves. It is nice to have a couple of kids, but a million pounds isn't enough to make it worth having a dozen more.

true,Necrosyrtes,prospectivestudent,Offer Holder,"Thanks for the essay (seriously)!

I look forward to seeing the Cambridge colleges, and will make sure I have already seen the college I wish to apply to before I send that application, which, as I write this, I realise is under 2 months away, closer to 1 (my school want it by late September)!

I'll make sure to think about those questions, but I'm not sure I'll be able to come up with a particularly convincing question for 3, though I think it's probably the case that many can't.

&gt; Why do you want to go to Cambridge? (why natural sciences over physics at Imperial)

I could say many bad things about Imperial, but I'm sure the interviewer wouldn't want to hear them! Not the nicest place in my books. I get what you're saying though, just thought I'd take the time to take a dig at Imperial. I can definitely think of good answers to that question.

Knowledge testing, I think I have down - it's what is tested in schools all the time and a little too much. Inference testing is something I think I would be quite good at, but the final type (I do not know the name either) seems to be something which is quite unpredictable. I would like to think that I can quickly assimilate new information, but we'll have to see. I will see if I can try and find any ways to practice this, but the timing is the real factor - I know with a high degree of certainty that for most questions that would be asked in a Cambridge interview, I would be able to sit there and get an answer within an hour or so, but in interview, with the pressure of importance and time, things will be very different. I will try and ask my teachers if they can provide any support with this.

The interview, to me (and probably most others), is one of those things that you are both excited for, yet dread, a phenomenon that there must be a word for that I do not know. I think that my biggest worry is that I'll come off as too quiet, or won't ask enough of the 'right' questions. I suppose that is part of the thing they are testing for though, and if I lack those qualities, since they are vital to the supervision process, and I will graciously, albeit disappointedly accept my rejection. I fear too that the questions not being immediately answerable by me, and my expectations formed from reading accounts of true genii like von Neumann, will cause me to break in interview, despite it *not* being the case that you should immediately answer, so like I have said before, I will see about arranging a mock interview with teachers, or getting friends to find some questions to ask me randomly.

Now I must apologise for my essay. Honestly, what I have written is just a stream of my consciousness, but I find I can consolidate ideas better when I start writing, as it forces you to think more deeply about what you are saying, and I plan on coming back to this in the near future when I will hopefully be preparing for my interviews.

true,ddosn,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; describing it as one of the most prosperous countries in the world with very advanced trading. Yet after independence it was one of the poorest.

Yes, it was rich, however the undercutting of indian industry by British mass production caused Bengal to lose its riches and goods and therefore its trading power.

Yes, it didn't really industrialize under British rule, unlike a number of other provinces which did in South and Central India, but it was hardly extremely poor either. Its poverty post independence mostly came from having a huge influx of people from the, frankly, messy split that it simply could not deal with. It also didn't help that West Pakistan absorbed all the funding leaving very little for East Pakistan/Bangladesh.

&gt;India's last big famine was in 1943, yet millions died in famine while India was under British rule.

When Britain was still limited to trading outposts, over 5 million people in India were dying from Famine every time there was a famine. In 1782-1784, the death toll from a two year long famine was *22 million*. To put that into perspective, that is more people dying in a single famine than died (in British territory) in all famines under British rule from 1790-1947, not including the death tolls of the princely states, which Britain had no control over.

If anything, Britain reduced famine death tolls from routinely 5+ million to routinely less than 1.5 million (in its territories. Again, the princely states are not included as Britain had no control over them).

As for the Bengal famine, the main cause was WW2. It also didn't help than internal Indian politics between the Muslims and Hindu's prevented food that was traveling through India from other areas (which would have prevented the famine) from actually reaching Bengal.

The Hindu states with surplus food would not give their extra to Muslims states. Muslims stats likewise wouldn't give their food to Hindu's. However, the Muslims states in India were isolated from each other in the North West and North east of the subcontinent. So the food had to travel through Hindu territory. The Hindu's stopped the food, or at least made its progress as slow as possible so as to prevent it reaching the Bengali people who needed it (who were mostly Muslim).

Eventually the food was fast tracked when the British Army took over the convoy and made sure it proceeded unimpeded.

Ironically, had Britain been more iron fisted in India at the time, the famine would most likely have not happened.

&gt;British weavers couldn't compete with Indian textiles. Yes, they were being undercut in many areas.

In the very early 1700's, before the Industrial revolution had even really started. Hell, the British weavers of the 1720's would most likely have been cottage industries themselves!

Fast forward to 1790, when the real 'damage' to Indian industry started, and the British now had hundreds of mills and factories pumping out goods and undercutting cottage industries left, right and centre. It was inevitable that India's cottage industry was going to collapse.

&gt;So why did the government ban and impose huge tariffs the import of calico? The title of the 1721 act is quite self-explanatory: ""An act to preserve and encourage the woollen and silk manufactures of this kingdom"". India could produce these things for less than British factories could, and the East India Company was still making money after transporting it back. Daniel Defoe wrote: ""The prohibiting the importation of East-India printed calicoes and silks, in the year 1701, sensibly restored and recovered the weavers who at that time were in a most miserable ruined condition"".

Admittedly all these textiles weren't just coming from India. But a hell of a lot of it was. This all started in the years before the East India Company established company rule but obviously still had a big trading presence.

Britain was looking out for its people. There is noting wrong with that.",1,1408484080,null,0,false,0,cjuya1i,t3_2dz9hd,t1_cjuya1i,t1_cjuwo87,null,1435326221,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

Eto'o?

Too old, not good enough.

9 in 21 last season.

3 were against United, inflated numbers.

Still 3 against United aren't bad.

The goals were nothing special, he's not good enough.

We don't need someone great we just need a good option from the bench.

We need something great.

-End conversation-

My honest opinion: Mourinho knows how to utilise strikers like Eto'o in a way that no one else can. He only played him in home games, where Chelsea control the game from start to finish and pick their chances well. A striker like Eto'o did well enough for a season there but of course they'll upgrade.

Brendan won't be able to get half the goals out of Eto'o that Mou could. BR has a team with a different philosophy and strategy when approaching the game. Eto'o might still have goals in him but I doubt they'll come in droves for LFC. I could be wrong but I don't want this transfer to happen, even if we get a top tier striker and he sits on out bench, I'd rather we give more minutes to the players we already have like Lambert who we brought in as a backup striker or maybe a youth player.

The purchase is made before tax and NI so it only costs me £1080 out of my take home pay. Each share earns 5 pence per year in dividends which is paid in cash. It means each year, by investing £1080, I earn £150 interest. After three years I can withdraw the matching shares if I wish which is a gain of £1080 and if I wait five years then it will be completely tax and NI free (meaning the withdrawal amounts are £1500).

The difference between him and Paulinho is that I think there are some serious questions as to whether Pauly was ever world class.  Looking good in Brazil and the Confed Cup is quite likely flattering to deceive.  I don't think he's a dreadful player by any means, but it is arguable that he's moved to Europe too late in his career, and will now struggle to adapt to the new level, pace and style of play.  He could well come good, but like I said above, there's not a huge amount of evidence that his attitude is where it needs to be to succeed.

Lamela's situation is entirely different because his time here was so interrupted by injury, and his development/playing time so stifled by AVB and Sherwood that he hasn't really been given a fair run.

&gt; Its poverty post independence mostly came from having a huge influx of people from the, frankly, messy split that it simply could not deal with. It also didn't help that West Pakistan absorbed all the funding leaving very little for East Pakistan/Bangladesh.

India was not poor as a result of the independence campaign or by becoming independent. India was stagnating throughout colonial rule. Not a blip or anything, just consistent stagnation. In less than 3 years after independence annual growth in output  went from less than 1% to more then 3%, with growth per capita increasingly significantly. This doesn't really fit in with your claim.

&gt; It was inevitable that India's cottage industry was going to collapse.

What 'cottage industry'? 

India had a huge financial surplus.  It traded with Portugal, Netherlands, the UK and so on. It accounted for a disproportionate amount of world output. It wasn't some economic backwater.


&gt; Ironically, had Britain been more iron fisted in India at the time, the famine would most likely have not happened.

So one famine might have been prevented?

A number of prominent British people at the time(Florence Nightingale, Sir James Caird and William Digby, for example), had beef with how famines were being dealt with.


&gt;Britain was looking out for its people. There is noting wrong with that.

true,ddosn,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;India was not poor as a result of the independence campaign or by becoming independent. India was stagnating throughout colonial rule. Not a blip or anything, just consistent stagnation. In less than 3 years after independence annual growth in output went from less than 1% to more then 3%, with growth per capita increasingly significantly. This doesn't really fit in with your claim.

With the exception of 1900-1914, there rest of the era your data comes from just so happens to also be the era in which there were the two largest wars in Earths history as well as one of the worst depressions.

It is also hard to start industrialising a country as huge as India. Large parts of India were industrialised, but most of it wasnt.

&gt;India had a huge financial surplus. It traded with Portugal, Netherlands, the UK and so on. It accounted for a disproportionate amount of world output. It wasn't some economic backwater.

Cottage industry is the label for industry that is not factory/foundry/manufactory etc based. It essentially means artisans working in relatively small scale workshops.

It does not mean a nation is poor if ti has a lot of cottage industry, especially in the era we are talking about.

However, its production is slow and expensive and they can be easily undercut by mass production.

&gt;So one famine might have been prevented? This book will tell you that India had more frequent famines under British rule than before, and as I said the last major famine was in 1943 which is when it was still a colony.

First of all, that book is iffy. There is very little information on the famine rate in India, mainly due to the fact that famines were so common Indians rarely wrote about them, as was testified to by an Indian writer in the middle ages. Just because the famines in India were actually recorded (meticulously) by the British, does not mean that they occurred more often.

In fact, if you look at the writings of the Indian pre-colonisation, they do make reference to how famines were very common, with at least one major famine happening every decade or so in India that effected at least one province/state. In fact, famines were so common and devastating, the Indian writers from the middle ages actually wrote about how certain famines were less severe than normal.

Second of all, between the last major famine in India in the 1700s and the first major famine in India in the 1800's there was a 40+ year gap. Same with the the time gap between the last major Indian famine in 1899-1900 and the Bengal famine in 1943, which would not have happened had WW2 not happened (and the famine would have been easily solved if the internal politics of India had not gotten in the way).

This was unheard of in India, as prior to British rule, famines were happened at least twice every decade.

&gt;Basic economics teaches Ricardo's comparative advantage. Even more basic economics teaches Smith's absolute advantage.

Neither of which existed in the early 1700's.

Here's the deal. I chose to support Chelsea. I made that decision because I was drawn to the team. I like Hazard, I like the blue, it happens. 

When I was younger I lived in Buffalo, NY and on New Years Day we'd watch the College Football (American) Bowl games, I didn't have a team to root for because Univ of Buffalo wasn't a Div I school then. So I rooted for the teams who had the coolest color schemes and coolest logo. I ended up being a Florida State Fan. I was too young to understand they were a dynasty. I just knew I liked the garnet and gold and I liked the spear.

Happenstance happened and my family moved to Florida. So happened when it came time to apply for college, I chose to go to Florida State. So happened that I moved to LA. So happened that FSU was in the national championship game in Pasadena (super close to LA) this last year and it so happened that I got to go. What started as a 6 year old liking a color scheme turned into one of the best moments of my sports life 24 years later.

Anyway, I think a lot of the problem has to do with the proposed solutions from the people who dare bring up our problem with extremism. They're generally just as extreme. Either an uneducated 'Ship them back to their own country' (What, the UK?) or a slightly more moderate, but still extremely misguided 'Close down all mosques'. 

What are we supposed to do? You can ask for the 'muslim community' to do more, but then what can they realistically do. They already denounce all the extremist shit that's going on. 

What solutions are there to this problem? It seems the biggest problem we have is with youth that feel like they don't belong in the UK and to me that feels like more of a failure of British society more than anything else. 

Some people will moan at me for saying that, because it doesn't frame the situation as a foreign threat which could easily be neutralized. But it's the truth. These people are British and they grew up in Britain. If they're out in Iraq beheading people, then as a society we fucked up somewhere.

Do you think someone this twatty in dealing with current tennants would bother responding to a reference request for someone not paying him money?

I don't condone the idea of withholding rent but you should probably disabuse yourself of that concept sharpish.

It's worth mentioning that ""we don't do fridges"" really isn't good enough an answer from him though. If your original tenancy agreement said the landlord is responsble for furnishings, and a fridge is listed on that agreement, then he, by taking on the tenancy, is responsible for fixing or replacing your fridge whether he ""does"" them or not. He's welcome to not include furnishings on future tenancies but by taking over the house and the existing contract he's bound by it as much as you or the previous landlord is as far as I know. Disclaimer: IANAL but I live and rent in Nottingham which is a hive of wannabe slumlords. I've spent many hours fencing with dicks who think my property = my rules, and to hell with tenants' rights.

Would you care to quantify that or substantiate it with evidence? What sets this kind of extremism apart from neo-Nazism or gang violence? I do not doubt it exists, but there also exist many fringes of society with extremist elements. Frankly, I'm yet to see a quantitative analysis of the situation (a proper analysis, not a tabloid comment section) that Islamic extremism in Muslim sections of society are a serious threat to the UK, any more so than the EDL is. Racially motivated murders may not be branded as terrorism by the media, but they do occur and in all but semantics are the same as murders motivated by an Islamic fundamentalist ideology. 

Objectively, based on numbers, alcohol is probably the single most damaging parameter in our society today, yet that never seems to come up in these discussions on ""problems this country has"".

&gt;screams ""racist"" at people who want to talk about it.

Probably because these people are pushing unsubstantiated opinions claiming that Muslims are the main problem with the country. That may be the case, but to say so without evidence is an indication of racist tendencies.

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"Really, I think there are two questions we need to ask:

1. How much is the instability, violence, and human rights violations in many Islamic countries due to Islam?

1. Is it, and if so why is it, attractive for many Muslims in non-Islamic countries, like the UK, to support these actions?

I'm only a pleb on these issues, and probably have a load of dirty left-wing bias, but here are my views.

1. People often compare countries in the Middle East to countries in the West, like the UK, and point out the stark disparities between them. I don't think this is a fair comparison. You cannot compare countries that are very rich and have existed in similar forms (similar forms of government, broadly similar borders, ect.) for hundreds of years, and who have slowly evolved into the democratic governments they are today, to countries who are generally poorer and have only existed in current or similar forms for less than 100 years. 

 You also shouldn't expect countries to instantly be able to accept new, in our eyes more fair, types of culture and government. One example always springs to mind with this issue. In the 1650s in England, a group called the Levellers existed. They supported a democratic country with equal rights between men and women. It took another 270 years for their ideas to come to fruition. I'm not sure we should be expecting countries, where many people were isolated from ideas of democracy and human rights until the late 19th century, to rapidly accept those ideas, just like we didn't. 

 I think a much more applicable comparison is to sub-Saharan Africa. Like many Middle-Eastern countries, these countries were colonized in the late 19th century, and didn't gain independence until the middle of the 20th. You find similar levels of instability, violence and human rights violations in these countries. 'Freedom House', a US based NGO, attempt to quantify levels of freedom in countries across the world, documented on [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_in_the_World) Wikipedia page. That page, as well as [this map](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_in_the_World#mediaviewer/File:2013_Freedom_House_world_map.svg) on it, suggest you find similar lacks of freedom both in the Islamic world, and in sub-Saharan Africa. 

 This suggests, to me at least, that you can't primarily blame Islam for the political unrest, and violent actions that happen in the Middle East, as you find similar actions in sub-Saharan Africa. Rather, it is that many of these governments are very young, and the culture of those countries not used to having those sorts of governments, which leads to instability and violence. You only have to look to long standing states which have large Islamic populations, like Turkey, to show that Islam isn't incompatible with human rights.

1. This is a question I'm a bit more stuck on. I think many statistics suggest that a significant number of Muslims in this country support the extreme actions and views of those in some of the more unstable and violent regions of the Middle East. While I would be interested to compare this to the number of people who support those views from African communities (i.e. those who support homophobia, for example), I still expect the percent from Muslim people to be higher. Why is this? 

 Again, I'm not so sure on this, but I would again suggest that it is difficult to change your culture. If you come from an area where many are homophobic, for example, it would be difficult to rapidly change those views, especially if you are isolated from different views. I think the best way would be to help immigrant groups integrate more, so they are more exposed to these more tolerant views, but I'm not sure how. However, I definitely don't think this would be achieved by further demonising those who are Muslims. You don't get people to change their mind by calling them idiots. 

I don't believe Islam is incomparable with Western values, and I don't think Islam is the root cause for the problems in the Middle East. However, I do think there is an issue with some Muslims in these country that they hold onto backwards views, and what I think the major discussion point is is how we can help change those views. 

EDIT: I've put a bit more thinking into question 2, and I think I have an answer I'm a bit more satisfied with.

You get extremists with every ideology, people who have no empathy, or are convinced about something bonkers, and take it a bit too far. However, it seems very many of them, or the ones who pose the greatest danger to us, are Islamic. Why is this? 

Well, consider you are a Christian extremist. You want to make a stand in the name of God, and smite down all those worshipping golden idols. But where do you go? Who do you get to teach you? There is no immediately obvious outlet for your views, and there is no one to influence you to blow things up, so you just let those views fester. However, if you are a Muslim, there are plenty of examples in the Middle East. Because of the instability I explained above, extremists are allowed to prosper. I guess a question that crops up is out of instability and Islamic extremism, which came first? I'd argue that the instability was the chicken, and the religious extremism was the egg. Again back to 1650s Britain, and in the instability caused by the Civil Wars, you saw extremist and radical groups like the Levellers, the Diggers, the Ranters and the Fifth Monarchists all growing in power and influence. Those groups definitely didn't cause the Civil War, but vastly benefited from it. I think this is the same as the Middle East. Islamic extremism is more prevalent because it it more visible, and it is more visible because of the instability in the Middle East.

The Scottish parliament has some achievements of its own, but it is equally hard to justify the expenditure of money against what is achieved.

As far as I'm concerned, government is an invitation to corruption. We can largely root out corruption from central government because there is so much scrutiny from within and without (though worth noting the various scandals that have taken place in Westminster over the years). Subsidiary parliaments just create greater opportunity for corruption and general wastage, without doing anything of note to justify this.

I've always, somewhat naïvely, believed that what drove people to this situation was not a religious compulsion, but rather the desire for a better life and standard of living for them, and their fellow countrymen. I've always thought that this compulsion to commit such acts was simply a guise for something deeper, a struggle to live a comfortable life. 

I mean religious violence does correlate pretty well with low standards of living doesn't it?

But yet, in this video, there stands a man raised in Britain, a state where to live a comfortable and carefree life is common, beheading another man.

I've now come to the realisation that the only way for us to live together in this world is not just prosperity, as I once thought, but education and the complete death of religion.

Religion is what drove this man who could have easily had a life of 9-5 and sky sports, to behead a fellow human.

Ban faith schools, encourage secularism, educate well. Doing these things won't stop Isis but it might just stop blokes like him from taking a gap year in Iraq.

true,eisenschiml,lfc12,,"Simply put, Clyne is a right fullback.  Literally the furthest player from Skrtel's position, for those of you at home.  Skrtel was picking up the player attacking from the left, who at that point had made a run infield of Manquillo.  I would have been pissed if he hadn't done so, as that would have been some amateur-level ball-watching.  Blaming Skrtel for that goal is some lazy analysis.  Skrtel was low-key our best player in that game.

&gt;Pelle's shot
I entitle him to missing a few aggressive cut-out type clearances because of the sheer number that he gets right.  He is better than 99% of defenders in this regard and the stats prove this.

&gt;Davis' shot
Same deal, even more so than Pelle's

&gt;Clyne's second chance
See Clyne's first.

It's almost complimentary to Skrtel that we end up blaming him for these things, which are actually caused by lapses at full-back, and more often lapses in midfield.  The fact that we are so used to him cleaning up after our team seems to give us a sense that every goal our team lets in is his fault, when really he is usually the one standing in the way of our team letting in far more goals and opportunities.

    Matic - Ramires/MvG

That way we can be just as solid, but maintain a very strong goal-threat. Games last season that we controlled like City away were tighter than they should have been because we couldn't score more than 1.

Ring of Fire lyrics:
Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring.
Bound by wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire.

I fell into a burning ring of fire,
I went down, down, down as the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns,
The ring of fire, the ring of fire.

The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet.
I fell for you like a child,
Oh, but the fire went wild.

I fell into a burning ring of fire,
I went down, down, down as the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns,
The ring of fire, the ring of fire.

I fell into a burning ring of fire,
I went down, down, down as the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns,
The ring of fire, the ring of fire.

And it burns, burns, burns,
The ring of fire, the ring of fire,
The ring of fire, the ring of fire.

Note that employment tribunals are a fast-tracked, low-bureaucracy and specialist alternative to county court. I guess, for the value of this, you could try small claims court, but it still comes down to proving it.

I don't know what you mean by ""frivolous employment tribunals"" or ""fictitious claims"", and you haven't provided any evidence that they've been successful. But someone earning, or formerly earning, £50,000 or £100,000 a year has a lot more to offer a lawyer if the case is won. Likewise there is religious principle to be considered in the case of a woman sacked, for example, over wearing a cross.

UK legal damages are not a big lottery win like in the US system - here it can only compensate you for loss. You're not starving, and if you find another job then you won't be considered to have lost much.

I don't think you'll be able to claim constructive dismissal because I don't see that they've truly made your employment untenable.

By all means talk to some *no win, no fee* lawyers, but I doubt they'll be interested.

true,ManElegant,null,null,"Agree to a point. The one thing I'd say could work in our favor if we were to get him would be that we play with actually wingers who've been brought in with the main purpose of supplying the front man.  

Chelsea last year (which, is not to say they'd be the same this year) had more emphasis on attacking midfielders and ""false 9's"" in Schuurle and Hazard scoring. 

With goals coming from Oscar, Ramires and Lampard. Even Willian and Salah later still played quite a narrow attack. The emphasis wasn't on the lone striker like it would be for us.

It's no surprise to me he's gone back to Drogba and gotten in Costa. Two masters at playing up front oh their own. I think he didn't play to Eto's strengths as well as he could have last year. Your point in Mourinho in getting the best out of guys like that is 100% correct and his signings back up your point of how he thinks and styles his team. 

I just don't think that system suits Eto like it does the two guys he brought in. Not now anyway that he's lost a yard or two of pace.

I think he could do a job for us. But much like yourself I think he'd be pretty underwhelming. A guy who can do a job isn't really what we should be targeting now.

If going out and socialising at pubs is your thing, here's what I've found:

The Clarkson arms is full of dole-dossiers and boring alcoholics who think they are hilarious. You can have a chat in there but most of them don't know what day of the week it is.

Mendis on a Friday night is more a dance place and it's quite enjoyable. Closes at 1 however, so people trek to spoons afterwards.

The Case is nice, cheap drinks on Thursday Friday Saturdays, but obnoxiously loud music and occasional pikeys.
The Horsefair tavern is okay but quite rough so I've heard. Same goes to The Globe, The Kings Head and a few others.
Spoons, which is coincidentally closest to you is probably the best. No music, but friendly crowd usually.

If you like takeaways, the best Chinese is Ruby and the best kebab is King Kebab.

The only place I would really avoid is Wisbech park at night, it is hell. My friends and I used to go there at night and just play hide and seek for a laugh and we've been threatened/chased by drunk foreigners many times. Avoid it like the plague.

&gt;The __Antarctic Treaty__ and related agreements, collectively known as the __Antarctic Treaty System__ (__ATS__), regulate [international relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations) with respect to [Antarctica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica), Earth's only continent without a native human population. For the purposes of the treaty system, Antarctica is defined as all of the land and [ice shelves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_shelf) south of [60°S latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60th_parallel_south). The treaty, entering into force in 1961 and currently having 50 signatory nations,  sets aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, establishes freedom of scientific investigation and bans [military activity on that continent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_activity_in_the_Antarctic). The treaty was the first [arms control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_control) agreement established during the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War). The [Antarctic Treaty Secretariat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Treaty_Secretariat) headquarters have been located in [Buenos Aires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires), Argentina, since September 2004.

Creating your own currency is a risky move at the best of times but as a new state? In the current economic climate, or even the one we will likely have in two years time? Bold at the very least. 

Pegging it to the pound doesn't make things much better. Your control over your own economy just took a serious body blow. You no longer have an independent monetary policy. Why would a business decide to invest in Scotland in this scenario? The rUK is just down the road, globally speaking, and doesn't have this problem.

Adopting the Euro *could* work but that's a long term ploy. Even if, in spite of general consensus, the EU adopts Scotland immediately they are not going to allow them to use the Euro overnight. Too much damage has been done to the eurozone in recent history for them to allow a newly formed state in without it having a proven track record. Doable, but not for I should think at least a couple of years,probably longer.

I suppose pedantically speaking Scotland doesn't *NEED* a currency union in the truest sense of the word. In the way a fish needs water or a person needs food, but if Scotland wants to transition from UK to independent state with the minimum of fuss and no economic insecurity then it is necessary.

Precisely. And that is where someone like Emre Can or Joe Allen would work nicely in, say, a 4-3-3 that can sometimes look like a 4-1-2-1-2.

I actually believe that you *can* rely on Lambert. But you *can't* rely on Borini. I'm not saying that Borini lacks the skills per se, but I just don't think he'll get enough playing time to get into a rhythm while an experienced player like Lambert is comfortable and confident enough in himself to score goals as a striker or pop off the bench and come up with the goal as well.

And if (when? touch wood) Sturridge gets injured, I think Rodgers won't have a problem using Lambert in the Sturridge role or even Sterling. And that, in turn, could even open up a regular spot for Markovic or Ibe.

Oh, depth! I love you!

Though, let me be clear, I do understand that should try to get another striker. And I certainly won't complain if the likes of Cavani, Falcao or whoever we're linked with ends up pulling on Liverpool shirt in September.

That may be hard to stomach for some fans but the truth is that even Manchester United at their peak (yeah we hate them but we have to admit how insanely successful they were at the time) couldn't hold on to Ronaldo because Madrid and Barca are just too inviting for *most* players. Obviously there are some one club legends who can resist those offers. Liverpool aren't his boyhood club so that's not an attachment that might keep him.

I've seen a couple of videos now where a young teenager does the beheading or holds up the head to the camera after it has been cut off.

I think it's probably just a coincidence because they wanted to really set Twelve's look off from the modern Doctors and hint at One and Two but still give him some character. But now I'm going to be watching for any hints of a connection between Twelve and the Master.

BTW, now that I think about it, none of the Doctors was really ever associated with red normally, right? At least not that shade. 

Four's scarf and tie had a sort of red, but more orange-ish than scarlet. 

Five's sweater did have a red chevron, but he was otherwise dressed in white, so that's as opposite to Twelve as you can get.

Six... well, let's not speak of Six, except that his outfit was so motley that no one color stands out.

Jump forward to Ten and there were those red trainers, but again not as vivid a shade.

And, finally... I wonder whether they're going to deal with the Valeyard in this Series. He came between the Doctor's Twelfth and ""last"" regeneration, but Eleven told us that he'd used up thirteen before Gallifrey basically rebooted him. So... um...

true,bottomlines,null,null,"Very very interesting. Here's a summary:

Robots taking over many jobs by 2045. 

Increasing reliance on technology - both an advantage and disadvantage as we open ourselves up to new attacks. 

Privacy will continue to become difficult. Surveillance, tracking and computing will become more prevalent and ubiquitous. 

Alternative currencies to become more important- mainly seen as a disadvantage because it allows criminals to hide funds and make illegal payments. US dollar likely to decline as global currency. 

Corporations and private industry likely to become more powerful and states become less powerful and less able to control things. 

Rising use of nuclear energy creates worries about material falling into the wrong hands. Not necessarily a nuclear weapon, but potentially a dirty bomb. 

Receding ice in the polar regions allows new exploration and utilisation of resources there. Possibility for conflict over resources. 

Immigration will continue to be an issue. There are worries about conflicts in home countries spilling into new countries, such as Sunnis vs Shias in the EU, though this will depend on how many of each group move (currently mostly Sunni not Shia). As immigration increases, integration will likely suffer as immigrants move into the same places and form their own countries and elect their own representatives. 

Religion is also (sadly IMO) likely to have a larger influence on politics as people become increasingly represented on a regional level and are able to vote for religious people to represent them. 

Europe: EU and Euro likely to still be around. But very likely to have changes in membership, with some new countries joining and some quitting or being forced to leave. EU likely to maintain close ties with the US. However, the US will shift focus to Asia, and the EU will become more responsible for our own security (at the moment we underspend because the US backs us up). Turkey will become more important but unlikely to be a full EU member by 2045. Europe unlikely to have any major problems with China. Russia is seen as the largest threat to Europe. EU will be relatively unaffected by climate change- though agriculture in the South may suffer and extreme weather becomes more common. 

The US. Will remain dominant economically and militarily in the future. China will catch up militarily around 2045. The US are likely to become energy independent due to their own natural resources. That means less dependence on the Middle East, though the US involvement there is unlikely to change. 

The US will focus on China and India. They have alliances with India but stronger trade with China. There are current security agreements (Japan, S Korea, Taiwan etc) which could force the US into war with China, but it is unlikely due to mutual dependence on each other - with china being a major holder of US debt and the US being a big trade partner for China. 

South America will become more wealthy but a lot of it will remain shit. They are also quite vulnerable to climate change. 

Africa will become more wealthy and modernised, but the degree will vary massively by country. Corruption will still be a huge barrier to getting anything done there. As AIDS and malaria decline, diabetes and heart disease will rise. 

Middle East will remain a bad place to be. Regional tensions, religious differences and massive inequality are unlikely to be solved by 2045. The US may still be involved there, but in general the west will be less dependent on the Middle East. Extremism will still be a problem, with worried about it spilling into immigrant communities in more civilised countries.

I really think she deserved (really needed) two seasons for her character to fully grow and get fleshed out before she left.  I think her departure would have had a much greater impact if we had had more time to get to know her and invest in her growth first.

I don't mind that it was tragic, but I feel like the show needs to find a better balance between tragedy and comedy, order and chaos.  I've started to feel like they are rushing through too much and not taking the time to develop it properly.  I feel like the rhythm is wrong, like too often the show goes from chaos to chaos without any significant interludes of order.  In normal story telling those interludes serve as rewards to both the characters and the audience for overcoming their trials and tribulations, as well as providing everyone a chance to stop, catch their breath, and see how far they've come.  While their absence may not have a great effect on any one individual story, I feel like their absence is hurting the overall story that is the Doctor's life.

Another place I felt like it was a problem was River Song.  We only saw them together as a married couple once, and that was her last appearance (alive anyway).  I think that she really needed more episodes after their wedding.  We needed to see them as a married couple.

The fact of the matter is that the character exists in the written form of one language and not the other, and there must be a way of reproducing it. The sound can be reproduced by a combination of other characters, and as the sound of the word is what its component characters must ultimately represent, the transposition of ue and ü is fairly logical. It's tragic that a miscommunication led to personal harm, but that's not a problem inherent to the spelling of a particular sound...it's a problem with consistency in representing it. Should you think that it's representation should be accomplished by simply adopting the umlaut into English, I would caution that this would be far more difficult given most speakers' obvious unfamiliarity with the character, requiring an adjustment unnecessary by simply persisting with ""ue"".

I think there is a danger in generalisation on both sides here. Muslim extremism is real and absolutely should be discussed, debated and any threats to the lives of others tackled in some way.

But many of this 'section of society' you are talking about are simply concerned that an entire people will be demonised for what are the actions of a minority, which could lead to the problem becoming worse, and really just making the world a shittier place without solving any problems.

&gt;Sweeping the issue under a rug and hoping it will go away by itself simply will not work.

If you live in the UK then I am not sure how you can believe the issue is anything but at the forefront of public discourse. 

&gt;We cannot allow ourselves to cower at accusations of racism from the left nor from the Muslim community itself.

It comes down to what people are specifically talking about, doesn't it? Because while Muslim extremism is real, so is racism.

true,InitiumNovum,null,null,"&gt; What would be the anthem of this new State?

Perhaps a new anthem could be written, the present one actually has very violent lyrics and ""Ireland's Call"" used in All-Ireland rugby doesn't really sound nice for a national anthem. Regardless, an anthem would be least of one's worries. 

&gt;  Would this new Country keep the Tricolour or replace it?

Keep the Green, White and Orange, it is a flag which was designed to account for major traditions and religions on the island. 

&gt; Would the Queen have any ceremonial role?

How could the British have a ceremonial role over a province in a republic? It simply would not work. And why should the British Monarch have any role at all?

&gt; Would this Country have an NHS?

The Republic is planning a system similar to the NHS. 

&gt; Would this Country use a federal system?

Most likely a federal system. One idea might be to have 4 states; the State of Ulster, the State of Leinster, the State of Connacht and the State of Munster plus a separate federal district which deals with all-Ireland affairs. The federal district may be Dublin County, or perhaps maybe a brand new district carved out in the centre of the country as a federal district contained a brand new Irish federal capital, with federal government and federal houses of parliament. Creating a new capital might help to ease the stigma of ""Dublin rule"" many loyalist have. Another idea might be to have dual-capitals; Dublin and Belfast would each become federal districts with the Lower House of Parliament being in Dublin and the Upper House of Parliament (Senate) being in Belfast and other administrative duties shared between both cities. 

&gt; Would a new police force be created or would the PSNI be integrated into an Garda Síochána?

Maybe. Or you could each of the federal states having control of their own police forces: Garda Ulster, Garda Leinster, Garda Connacht and Garda Munster plus federal police for the federal district(s).

&gt; Would Northern Irish speed limits be changed to Kilometres?

Most likely, but I don't see why this is such a big deal. SI units are the pretty much standard is most of the world anyway. 

&gt; What Corporation Tax system would the country use?

Probably a low corporation tax as the Republic now has. It's vital for helping Ireland, as a small European country, to compete against larger European economies. Low corporate tax is someone the Republic holds very dear. 

&gt; Would University be free?

University would be mostly free. In the Republic at the minute, a free fee scheme exists though students have to pay the university's registration fee. The registration fee is typically ~€2,000 but, depending on your income, you can get this all paid for you plus receive a maintenance grant. 

&gt; Would this country join the Commonwealth?

It's unlikely, but there are some politicians (most of whom in Fine Gael) who are open to the idea. Besides, what use is there exactly in joining the Commonwealth? If it's something that makes the loyalists happy, then I don't see how it would be much harm, as long as the British Monarch does not become the Irish Head of State. 

&gt; What law system would be used? and on and on.

A common law system based on the one which exists in the Republic at present. The legal system in the Republic in itself is very much based on the one in the UK. ",0,1408514267,null,0,1408535342,0,cjvbtfk,t3_2dzg59,t1_cjvbtfk,t1_cjultaz,null,1435334805,2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2

These two schools have an almost identical catchment area in one of the more deprived areas of Bradford, but for whatever reason, all the white familes send their kids to the one at the top of the hill, and all the Asian familes send their kids to the one at the bottom - that's where I worked.

A school of around two thousand students, of which around 90% were of Pakistani Muslim origins, and all lived within walking distance of the school.

Students who, aside from the occasional visits to Grandma's village in Pakistan, had never left Bradford. Most of them had never been to Leeds, even, or Halifax. A lot of them had never taken a bus or a train, and would even be driven to and from school by parents or older siblings, despite living around the corner.

Students who, due to their families not speaking English at home, could barely string a coherent sentence together, and had severely stunted literacy.

Students who, due to family pressure, all want to become Doctors, but don't want to go anywhere other than the University of Bradford to study.

Students who, being from such disciplinarian families, would turn feral the moment they entered the school building, and merrily vandalise anything within reach. Within about a month of taking posession of our new £53m school building, there was grafitti on every surface, and half the plug sockets and gas taps in the Science labs were broken.

Students who would openly admit they had no interest in studying Science, as it contradicted what they were being told at Mosque.

Students, and staff, who would succumb to actual pant-wetting terror on the corridor when one girl was believed to have a Djinn.

Despite all this, the boys all believed they were big men, and would swagger around with their ridiculous little manbags, sneering at any attempt at discipline. Meanwhile the girls were evenly split between good little silent Muslim girls as they'd been taught to be, and screeching mouthy harpies.

true,rubygeek,null,null,"&gt; Just a note that cocodamol is codeine paracetamol mix, not a more potent version.

You are right it is a mix as well, but yes, it comes in far more potent prescription only versions, - up to at least 30mg of codeine per pill - unlike the over the counter products which I believe are legally capped at 12.8mg.

&gt; Its also mixed with paracetamol not to make it more dangerous but to make it more effective at what we want it to be good at (analgesia) but not better at the sleepy, dopey opioid side effects.

That'd be fine, and believable, if *both* were available, or if they'd kept it as prescription only. 

The problem is allowing it over the counter, but mandating that they are only made available as a compound with drugs that are amongst the most dangerous we sell (Paracetamol overdoses in particular is a major cause of liver failure). *That* has the effect of putting people at risk. Especially when they only make the low strength versions legally available, and people who are taken off the higher strengths versions often are addicted.

The only reason to maintain that legal restriction *is* to make it more dangerous. If not, we'd trust people to be able to make the choice and/or to take codeine and paracetamol in separate pills. In fact, when Nurofen Plus was originally launched, it apparently contained the ibuprofen and codeine in separate parts of the pills, that could easily be split - that ended exactly over concerns about recreational use. 

We're in the bizarre situation that having the amount of codeine found in even a **single pill** of the strongest over the counter pain killers on you is illegal if the codeine is pure, but legal if mixed with ibuprofen or paracetamol.

20-year-old winger is hoping to make his debut against Manchester City on Monday

Liverpool take on Olympiakos at the Soldier Field Stadium in Chicago, Illinois in the International Champions cup. Lazar Markovic chases the ball.
Lazar Markovic insists the £20million price tag won’t weigh heavily on his shoulders as the Liverpool FC new boy vowed: “I’m here to win the title.”

The 20-year-old winger, who was snapped up from Benfica when the Reds triggered his release clause, is hoping to make his debut against Manchester City on Monday after recovering from the hamstring injury he suffered during the pre-season tour of America.

Boss Brendan Rodgers described Markovic as one of the most exciting young talents in Europe and the Serbian is confident he can live up to that billing.

“I’m not afraid of challenges,” he said.


 

“It was the same when they took me on trial at Partizan (Belgrade), when the Benfica offer arrived and when Liverpool signalled that they wanted me in their ranks.

“I believe in myself and in the luck that’s following me. I believe in the people in charge of my career. That is why I go with my dreams.

“I’m not the most expensive signing of the summer but even if I were I wouldn’t care much about that.

“I’ve never thought about anything in relation to money. I’ve never cared about or done anything for money in my personal or my professional life.

“What does it even mean to be more expensive than others? It absolutely doesn’t matter. The pitch, not the money, is the measure of everyone’s worth in football.

“I believe Liverpool fans expect a lot from me, and to be honest I expect a lot from myself. The same applies for the people who worked hard to bring me here.

“I do not have any fear or stage fright whatsoever. To tell you the truth, I can’t wait to start playing for Liverpool.”

Markovic, who will wear the No 50 shirt for the Reds, maybe young but he already boasts an impressive medal collection,

His four seasons as a professional have all ended with a title triumph.

He won three championships with Partizan in his homeland before moving to Portugal and helping Benfica celebrate a domestic treble and reach the final of the Europa League last term.

Liverpool take on Olympiakos at the Soldier Field Stadium in Chicago, Illinois in the International Champions cup.

Markovic is keen to continue that winning streak by helping Liverpool end their long wait for a 19th top-flight crown.

“The competition is fierce but I did not come to Anfield to fight for sixth or seventh place,” he said. “Liverpool and our fans deserve the return of the most important trophy. I would love to be a part of the generation that brings this trophy back to Liverpool.

“With the Premier League and the Champions League, we’ll be going for it on both fronts. There are a lot of reasons for optimism. This club is very ambitious.”

Markovic, whose preferred role is wide left, says he benefited greatly from his time in Portugal. And now he’s looking forward to developing further under the guidance of Rodgers.

“The season spent in Benfica helped me mature, become more serious, physically stronger and improve my tactical knowledge,” Markovic told Serbian magazine Mozzart Sport.

“As long as I live I will be thankful to the coach, his assistants, my team-mates, all the physios and doctors, the president of the club, the board members, and every single fan for making me the player that I am today.

“I was still a little child when my parents explained to me that smart people work on themselves and learn as long as they live.

“I believe that Mr Rodgers will help me to become even better, just like he did with other young players. We’ll see where the coach will put me because I can play many positions and for every one of them there is great competition. I will give it my all.”

Markovic says settling into his new surroundings has been made easier by the support of skipper Steven Gerrard.

“When we say Liverpool most of us think of Steven Gerrard, and that’s not only the case with us who were born in the Nineties,” he added.

“He is a legend, an icon, the king of the club. Yet still he is completely natural and normal.

“We all listen to him and treat him with the utmost respect. He welcomed me like a true captain and a great gentleman, just like he did with all the other new guys.”",0,1408516170,null,0,false,0,cjvcd0p,t3_2e0tpt,t1_cjvcd0p,t3_2e0tpt,null,1435335257,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9
