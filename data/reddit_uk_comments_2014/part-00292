Do you think Onomah will make it? I rate him as our Pogba. The kid is insane - something about him just reminds me of Pogba, no idea why. Maybe it's his winger like control with his frame perhaps, not sure. Another guy I love is Marcus Edwards - I think that lad will be something special. I was lurking on some other forums, and many other fans of other clubs who follow their academies/fans of English Youth Football are putting Edwards up there as one of Englands best ever prospects - he looks the real deal. I think Musa will be a real talent too - he just has that natural eye for a pass that you can't teach. I know Coulibaly was hyped up to the max, but I feel Musa just has something about him. I guess time will tell. 

Also, Carter-Vickers (next King? trained with the first team IIRC?), Oglivie, Walker-Peters and Oduwa are players I have high hopes for. So happy for Winks to get his deal too - and I'm hoping with Masons recent performances Pritchard can step up - because I think he's an INSANE talent. Lesniak &amp; Veljkovic look decent too.

During matches we see other formations, when City are ahead they will bring on another defensive midfielder and play one up or when behind they will push Yaya further up.  

Personally I think the formations matter less.  The players are generally very flexible when attacking.   Full backs overlapping as wingers.   Wide midfielders popping up on opposite wings or in the middle.  Silva particularly is everywhere.  Navas less so, but more this season than last.   

The problems occur because defensively we get exposed.  Especially when teams defend in numbers and counter attack or flood one side and our full backs are exposed (it cost us against Stoke, and was the problem against Roma).  

However by protecting your back four all match you become seriously outnumbered when attacking and can't break sides down.  The difference between games we win and lose comes down to how we put away our chances when they come up front.  If City are not ruthless then they get into trouble.

I don't know why it is, and it certainly isn't meant to be insulting but for some reason subtle British sarcasm tends to rub Americans the wrong way. 

American fans of soccer/football who come on to /r/soccer or /r/Everton need to come to grips with this and understand that the insults/jokes/trash talk isn't really meant to be an insult to Americans or Howard or whatever, and they need to learn to not take it so personally.  

I also think this is why some Brits think we have no sense of humor and can't take a joke when it's really just more likely that things are getting lost in translation, so to speak. From my experience American sarcasm and British sarcasm are different enough that there can be confusion.

I think you're taking a very loose definition of the word ""affect"" and ""stopped"" - if you know you're being watched, and you know the person watching may well choose to act on what they see, and that their action can include you being imprisoned... well then you're not exactly being paranoid or unreasonable if you choose to curtail your activities (including perfectly legal activities that might be open to misinterpretation) to avoid drawing attention or looking at all suspicious.

Last I heard, that kind of ""chilling effect"" isn't a hypothetical possibility; it's happening *now* with the current level of known surveillance. Some people will just joke about not googling for certain things in case you ""end up on a list"", others will *genuinely* feel uncomfortable and choose to avoid looking those things up, and honestly I can't blame them - and can't say I agree that it's them acting entirely of their own free will, which seems to be your implication.

And that's without even talking about the power to coerce that it hands to the authorities if they choose to use it. I really should bookmark [that post](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1fv4r6/i_believe_the_government_should_be_allowed_to/cd89cqr) (edit: found it) from a while back by someone who lived under a repressive surveillance state, about how insidiously fucked up it can get.

This is the worst thing he said. It doesn't matter that we can imagine maybe, just maybe, there are some out there who don't view it as a bad thing to have happened to them (although where's his evidence for that? It sounds like he has just imagined it to be the case and he actually made a very sweeping statement with 'those girls') ultimately, 14 year olds cannot consent. He is using semantics (feelings about the word 'victim') to minimise and justify a sexual crime. He is essentially saying it's ok to have sex with a 14 year old if they say they're up for it, ignoring the lack of consent and the imbalance of power and influence between a young teenager and a rockstar.

It seems to me that it is both a ""I don't trust my teammates to make the pass so I am going to work it out myself"" and a ""I am used to doing this"" problem.

The best illustration happens last game -- sterling had the ball, and both he and mario are 5 yards in front of the 18 yard box. The Basle defenders were *backing off* both players (mistake for them), leaving a huge hole in front for Mario to run into. Raheem was holding the ball, and attracting attention, and Mario's right decision is to run into the open space in front of him for a pass from  Sterling.  (IN my mind as I watched the game, I thought ""That's What Suarez would have done"")

You can see Sterling visibly *waiting* for Mario to run. But instead, Mario didn't run, but instead stood where he was and gestured to his feet, i.e. he wants Sterling to pass him the ball. What was on Mario's mind? It's obvious -- he wants the ball to him, and then he will take a shot or dribble into the space in front of him.

This is a bad decision -- Raheem's ball will get to Mario, and the defenders will then push forward and close down the space. Also, it's not LFC's DNA -- we are used to playing with speed and one touch, not fancy dribbles.

There are numerous tragedies intertwined in this truly horrific incident. Firstly it's truly terrible when anyone loses their lives, particularly in such a violent way. My sympathies go out to the family of Elizabeth Thomas, and her friends.

And to the parents, and friends of Steven Miles, who will have to contend with the shattering of their own lives; the constant burden of ""could we have done something"" / ""Are we in some way culpable for his actions"" etc. etc.

To an extent there's also Steven Miles himself - though naturally any sympathy for him should be reserved, the fact is his life is, at this point, effectively over. On the assumption that he actually survives for 25 years inside - and given the hierarchy of criminality within the sovereigns Prison system that's somewhat unlikely - he'll emerge into a world totally alien to him, with zero prospects of developing a career, hell even getting a job will be next to impossible.

As I said, it's difficult to elicit sympathy for him, but we imprison people for three primary reasons: We deem their crimes of a severity that warrants removal of their freedom and liberty; We feel they represent a threat to the public at large; *To facilitate the process of rehabilitation*

But another tragedy is how this case has been reported. Almost every media report - from the right-leaning Daily Mail, to the more centre-left media, has gone to pains to include references to the following aspects of this case:

* The murderers obsession with the TV programme Dexter.
* His ""Autistic Syndrome"".
* His previously diagnosed poor Mental Health.
* His fascination with certain books, notably the Hannibal ""Trilogy"" and certain films.

The way these aspects have been reported, would make one think these are all warning signs to look out for.

[I must be the next fucking Fred West then](http://i.imgur.com/fIz5yg4.jpg)

Based solely on the fact that I have the Dexter books - big warning there, I own - and have read, The Hannibal *omnibus* - not the three books, but the four**!** *and* I'm on crazy person medication, at a medium dosage.

I mean, holy fucking cuntballs, someone backtrace my IP number and alert special branch.

**Or not.**

I'm not a particularly avid gamer - though I have clocked up ~1,000 hours on a previous iteration of the Football Manager series according to steam, but I know of enough gamers who are delightfully well-adjusted, productive members of society, who contribute so much to the lives of those around them.

Yet, every time some unhinged individual goes on a killing spree - usually in the United States - our press latches onto the violent video games bandwagon, and tries to scare people into thinking all players of the GTA series can't differentiate between reality and the game world.

Reading, or watching Dexter; Reading or watching the Hannibal series of stories, doesn't make you some evil sycophant with plans to commit bloody rampage. Nor does being on medication for a diagnosed mental health issue.

Steven Miles didn't turn into a violent murderer because he thought he was Dexter Morgan; Nor did reading some of the Hannibal series of books imbibe within him a fascination for certain forms of wine and cannibalism.

In many ways he was failed by the Mental Health Services. Due, no doubt, to an ever increasing workload due to GP referrals; combined with budget cuts, he was allowed to fall through the net.

I don't know - I could honestly go on for another twenty or so paragraphs, but ultimately it won't change anything. It won't bring the poor girl back; bring any kind of comfort to her family and friends. I just wish the reporting on these kinds of horrific events was a bit more balanced at times, and didn't adhere to the journalistic mantra of the day - namely scare the public shitless, and mix in a little scandal for good measure.",0,1412281068,null,0,false,0,ckypog6,t3_2i34y7,t1_ckypog6,t3_2i34y7,null,1426714451,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I know its keeping jobs away from young people (supposedly, although that's another kettle of fish - so much needs done in this country - care work, nursing, conservation etc - yet there are 'no jobs' - is that just a byword for 'we don't have the money to pay people to do these things'?) but still, the pension was invented/came in as a way to fund people for the last ten years of their life back when life expectancy was 70 if you were lucky.

These days that pension that used to last you for 8-10 years now has to be stretched out thin to cover you for 30; and all the while what are you doing - sitting about in your (inadequately heated) house? Not to mention advances in life quality means that people at 60 and 65 are a lot more 'sprightly' and mentally active than they were when pensions were first introduced too.

I do recognise that this move would be tough on people who work in cleaning and manual labour though; I think I would be in favour of some form of job-sharing at least as a socially acceptable *option* offered to people over a certain age. That would at least help people have something in their life and not feel like a burden, and also probably subsist a little better than being on a pension.

Basically I had a lot of back and forth with a member of HR. I raised the point that there appeared to me to be two different scenarios (1. leaving before course completed, 2. leaving after completion) with a different consequence for each (1. Liable to repay 2. can request to repay). I asked them to explain the wording and to demonstrate where I am liable to pay in the second scenario since all my courses were complete. 

Long story short-ish, they asked for the document containing the extract from my original post, while linking what was clearly an updated version of the same document where they had reworded this section and now it was clear that you are liable for either scenario. I was able to prove using their intranet that this revised policy was created and uploaded after the dates I sat my courses and signed the agreement. I further pointed out that the wording must have been changed for a reason. 

They however didnt address anything that I wrote and simply said that I was liable without demonstrating like I asked. I sent a final email stating all the above again, and that as they have been unable to show where I am liable, that I deny their request for a refund. Which they thanked me and advised they would pass the message to head of HR.

I few days later was my final day, I emailed the head of HR directly with all my previous correspondence and reaffirming my position, they responded that they had received my message and they would not be charging me for the courses. 

Sorry I know I said long story short, but you did take the time to respond and felt that merited at least a semi brief update as to what happened.

Or the fiction of ""parallel construction"", where evidence obtained secretly is used to engineer some other more legally-allowable situation where the information comes to light apparently by coincidence...

Or if you want to stay entirely within the UK rather than looking abroad for the lessons of other nations with even more surveillance, on our own shores you hear stories of councils using surveillance powers written into law for anti-terror purposes being used to crack down on littering, or on people lying about which residence they ""mainly"" live at for the purpose of getting their kids inside of a better school zone...

You're not wrong that we're in a damn sight better shape than the likes of North Korea (I'm under no illusions there), but we only stay that way by objecting to the over-reaching attempts to claim more power and use it to more oppressive effect.

Fundamentally, I don't trust a promise to only use surveillance powers for good, because it's been demonstrated over and over that it isn't the case - that once the technical capability exists, it gets abused. I don't trust a promise that surveillance won't be used to enforce laws that *do* actively limit freedoms. I especially don't trust *every conceivable future government* to make those promises.",0,1412282248,null,0,false,0,ckyqbrd,t3_2i2voa,t1_ckyqbrd,t1_ckypc9m,null,1426714149,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Romania is a shit hole. I don't mean that in a nasty way - it's a terribly deprived place. Welfare is near non-existant.

There's no way that Romanian people should have been given freedom of movement - they'd be daft not to come here. 

It's important though not to blame them or dislike them for it. They're doing what we all do - try to better our situation.

What needs to happen is illegal employers are given enormous fines. People are deported. Shelters are removed. People are sent back to Romania.

The only way this stops is if these people get back home (safely and humanely) and tell the tale ""It's not true. Britain isn't the land of milk and honey.""

We also now are responsible as part of the EU for making things better in Romania. Manufacturing investment should be encouraged there. Partly to exploit (not in the nasty sense of the world) the cheap labour there but also to create employment. That will develop the area and over time wages will rise.

Now that we've let Romania into the EU we have a duty to improve things there, and the best way is not to encourage all their young people to migrate away to live in shanty towns and be employed illegally.

I don't know how familiar you are with the inner workings of the web, but the only thing reddit requires is a fundamental knowledge of CSS, and you can grab the rest from other subreddits by looking at their stylesheets to see how they do it. As far as learning HTML and CSS I'd recommend the starter course on [CodeAcademy](http://www.codeacademy.com).

false,sacredstones,null,null,"BR is a great coach, but he's stuck in a rut right now. he's got injuries going on everywhere and I think the pressure of a big club is starting to get to him. For example, though its not as black and white as some here think, I do agree that stevie should be rested and Lucas or someone else be given a chance. You can't completely blame him, because Stevie makes decent contributions in a game (although far from his previous form). Rodgers refuses to drop him and though its a fair decision on his part (he only has Lucas as replacement and Lucas is also in a slump) I can't help but feel that he feels pressure to play the Liverpool Legend and Captain every game. Sacking BR by X-mas would be incredibly stupid, IMO. I don't see how we'd be any better off. In fact I think it would hurt us more than it would help. We're already in another transition phase with Suarez gone and new players in. A new manager would mean that transition would take even longer as everyone would be back to square one. 

Sacking Gerrard is another knee jerk. Maybe you mean benching him? by all means we should be resting him. Not only for physical strain, but also his mental state. He needs a breather and he needs something to shake him up and wake him up. Seems disillusioned after slipping against chelsea and having a shit WC. kicking him out is completely unnecessary though. He can still play well and we still need the depth. He just needs rest and needs to be taken out of the double pivot, where he does worst. When he was sole DM at the base of a diamond midfield, he did great. His weakness is when he goes forward. Its too much for him now that he's old.

false,BuzzsawBrennan,null,null,"I thought Bentaleb was in good form this evening, his turn that led to the first goal and his patience combined with runs from Lennon and Davies managed to create Kane's second big chance. I think we should continue playing and starting him, he seems to be our most complete midfielder at the moment.

Kane looked solid up front, I'd like to see him start in the Premier League as the lone striker, I'm not entirely sure he's cut out to be a 10 but feel his finishing and positioning is good enough to merit a start over Soldado. 

Speaking of which, I'm fairly gutted for him. It evidently hurts him not to be scoring, and in fairness I feel being used in the Europa League squad isn't good for him. Evidently this squad is a tier worse than our first team and doesn't create nearly as much so in games like tonight against good opposition its hard for him to impress. Still though, I'm not entirely certain about starting him over Kane and Adebayor in the Premier League, so it is something of a dilemma. Don't want to see it not work out, because I feel its been on the cusp of coming good so many times but his confidence has been shattered so many times. 

I thought Dier and Davies contributed well to the attack, I'm not a great defensive analyst so I won't comment on that but does anyone else feel that the time is right to start giving Davies a shot in the Premier League? 

Other than that, and ignoring Hugos heroics, I thought our team looked fairly poor. This is clearly the level for Andros, don't see him playing in the Premier League any time soon. Not been impressed by Fazio so far. Vlad, bless him, not great. 

Dembele doesn't seem capable of contributing much to the attack, he can still drible well but in a situation where quick thinking and a good range of passing are required he seems to know his limits which is disappointing really. Didn't rate Paulinho's performance, being played out wide is maybe the problem, but his head seems to have dropped somewhat since he first arrived here. Stambouli looked good in parts, wouldn't mind seeing him form a partnership with Bentaleb.

That is the outstanding issue I have with Fry's comments in regard to all this, including the reports of his speech at the (Labour?) dinner a few months ago.

Obviously in this regard he's being interviewed and responding, but this is a topic I would have really hoped/thought he'd given some more consideration to. Not that I have any particular reason to, other than I admire(d) him in many regards so hoped he'd be more reasonable (in my opinion).

This is a particular example:

&gt; ""I've always thought them pretty repulsive things to do. I've never groped anyone as far as I'm aware. But groping is not the same as penetrative rape.

So far as I know *no-one* is claiming that it is (having said that I can imagine there will be fringe elements who do - but why should we suddenly pay attention to those at the end of the bell-curve?). The only people I've seen draw any kind of comparison or distinction are Fry (twice now) and Richard Dawkins on twitter. These ""Oh well X isn't as bad as Y"" claims are (objectively) true but it's underlining a point that wasn't really in contention and adding it to the conversation does absolutely nothing to help the reality of (alleged) victims.

&gt; ""Date rape isn't as bad as rape at knife point.""

Yeah... and?

&gt; ""A pin in the eye isn't as bad as a nail in the eye""

This helps us how?

With that kind of discussion being alluded to or those statements being made, we end up with dismissal of certain crimes because they're ""Not as bad as what could have happened."" A reddit case in point: the other day someone on here was crying foul that DLT was convicted on ""the most minor crime like this that he could have done"" and ""what a waste of time and resources.""

This may be a personal angle from Fry as I think he's had friends arrested and then not charged and so has seen them hurt, worried, scared etc. However he seems to be suffering from a lack of empathy, or even sense, given how clear it should be to everyone by now that quite a few men enjoying (celebrity/political) power back in the day took advantage of their position to abuse/assault/rape girls/boys/women/men.

Looking at it from a statistical point of view, it's far, far more likely that someone coming forward *is* a victim of an (abuse) crime they're alleging, than making it up for whatever reason. The most reasonable and empathetic reaction is to not-disbelieve them and support them through whatever process they're looking for. That *doesn't* mean that you have to therefore assume the alleged perpetrator is guilty and throw them to the wolves. You can be objectively neutral whilst doing the 'right' thing for both parties. I don't understand why more people can't remain 'on the fence' rather than needing to treat one or the other party like shit.

Sorry - got on a rant.

I'd agree that we can't trust the judgement of any given 15 year old but on a case by case basis if we actually knew the ins and outs of the affair and the individual in question we'd be able to provide better judgement.  However I appreciate your position as the law doesn't work in a subjective manner but has to objective hence the slight ""injustice"" at work here.  

&gt; I'm quite happy for any 15 year old who is mature enough to wait a year instead of taking the risk they're not.

That's because you're over fifteen. While I'm certainly not campaigning to change anything because its something we all suffer, I can certainly empathise with such young people that the law treating them all as equally stupid and drawing arbitrary age lines in the sand isn't fair.  
As an example not permitting 15 year olds to vote in elections is incredibly unfair given they will have to live for three years of voting age under a government they were not allowed to vote for or against.  

Its what we have and its the system that probably sucks least but we should appreciate that it still sucks.  
This is what frustrates me about your response. You text implies that this is all eminently logical when it can be silly in some cases.

I think the experience of riding a bike outweighs that of a car, because of the skill involved in doing it and the risk you take if you do it wrong. In a car, you have a significant margin of error - if you take that corner too fast, you may have ABS, two directional wheels instead of one and a metal cage around you to protect you. In a bike, you take that corner badly you will come off - and only you can affect the damage control you will subject yourself to.

I think it is that prior planning and development of skill that makes riding so appealing to me. I like the idea of having to plan my entry and exit to a corner - even if only to get the best view possible and forgetting all about the quickest, cleanest line - is so rewarding and feels so natural when you get some experience doing it, that in itself is a thrill. That to me is much more appealing than turning a wheel and feeling the car move for you.

I've started watching doctor who on the recommendation of my friend, and now I think I'm going to stop.
I just watched ""Daleks in Manhatten"" and ""Evolution of the Daleks"", and my god are those the most poorly-designed, plothole-ridden episodes of any tv show I've ever seen. Obviously they're old, so this post is in no way topical, but seriously, holy crap these episodes are bad.

I should point out that up until this point I actually liked what I'd seen of doctor who. It seemed like a fun, somewhat silly, british sci-fi show, and it was something I could get into. And then this happened.
So first-off, whoever was doing the dialogue should have been fired the moment they gave Tallulah (or however the heck you spell that) the line ""It's as if he doesn't want me to see him"" (probably not verbatim) while talking about whoever keeps leaving roses on her dresser after Laszlo disappeared. In that instant, every shred of doubt that may have remained concerning both the origins of the pig-men and Laszlo's fate was clumsily revealed, and all mystery was lost, making the *actual* explanation about the pig men, as well as the absurdly drawn-out reveal of Laszlo as a pig, completely redundant.

Now, let's talk about the Cult of Skarro's plan. They did an ""emergency temporal shift"" that landed them in 1930s New York, and since an emergency temporal shift, in the Doctor's words, ""must have burned out your power cells"", they could not leave. Let's leave that temporal shift alone for now; I'll be coming back to it later.

So, having no resources beyond what is available to them on planet earth, the Daleks, being the Cult of Skarro and therefore designed for such things, try to imagine a new way to achieve Dalek supremacy in their current predicament. The idea they come up with, or at least Dalek Sek comes up with, is that Daleks must evolve to survive, which is completely against the whole point of being a Dalek. I actually like this part. I think it's a really interesting idea that a Dalek would become aware of the inherent futility of their primary goal. However, the only reason it makes sense is because the Daleks are in a situation where they have *no* *other* *alternative*. Nothing else could make a Dalek even consider such a thing.

And that's a real shame because the episode later reveals that as a matter of fact that not only is there a significantly more viable alternative, but the Daleks actually carry it out! The entire existential thing was completely meaningless, and should never have happened! The alternative is, as Sek and the Doctor are preparing to fuse Dalek and human DNA, the remaining three ""pure"" Daleks alter the process so that the human bodies will now become ""100 percent Dalek"".

So... what? WHY would the Daleks ever have even considered merging humans with Daleks *partway* if the option to completely overwrite blank human bodies existed? This makes Dalek Sek's willingness to contaminate himself with humanity *completely* *absurd*! There is *no* *way* that the Daleks would get as far as the idea to *partially* fuse human bodies with Dalek DNA without coming up with the idea to completely overwrite the humans *first*! Even if one of the Daleks did somehow come up with the fusion idea, the conversation would have looked like this:

Dalek 1: ""We may be able to fuse Dalek and human DNA""
Dalek 2: ""Unnecessary. We already possess the technology to completely eradicate the human parts of their brains. There is no reason to do so only halfway.""

And that would have been the end of it! The idea that evolution is the only option would never even have come up, because at no point was it ever the only option!
So, the episode has just rendered its own plot redundant, and how does it end? The doctor goes up to Dalek Khan, the last remaining Dalek in the entire universe, and it does something that is both completely in character for a Dalek, and utterly ridiculous and nonsensical in terms of the situation.

It does the emergency temporal shift that the Daleks were UNABLE TO DO, WHICH WAS THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE ENTIRE EPISODE. THEIR POWER CELLS WERE ""BURNED OUT"". Obviously, the rebuttal here is that the doctor only said they were burned out, and they might not have been and he just didn't know. Except that, if the Daleks were capable of doing another temporal shift, they would have *done* *so* instantly! The whole reasons they come up with the plan that is the driving plot of the entire episode is because they are *stranded*! If, as it turns out, they weren't stranded, they would have fucking left! At this point, the redundancies I previously outlined concerning the Daleks' actual plan were themselves rendered moot by the fact that the entire sequence of events should *never* *have* *happened*!

**At this point I feel like I should point out that I am not insulting Doctor Who as a whole, nor do I have a problem with anyone who is a Whovian.

Well football has changed. Even the most stalwart defenders have an attacking side to their play that makes them the very best. Just so happens that Chiriches and Luiz fall on the more attacking side of defenders. And they are not the only ones, just look at Pique, Alves, and Alba. And there is a reason why I bring up Barca players; Barca changed the way the game is played. 

Guardiola's Barcelona changed the way the game is played today. All this talk of high lines, play makers, and attacking defenders, though they existed before, came back into the spot light because of the pure domination that Barca commanded under Pep. Just like how the play maker (or lack thereof) was on the mind of every Spurs fan prior to Eriksen, attacking defenders became the new fad thanks to Barca.

http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/comments/2gvut7/the_niacinamide_reviews/

IIRC your Simple moisturiser has sunscreen (SPF15?) if you apply plenty that might be fine for winter depending how exposed you are on a daily basis. Or you could switch to a richer Simple moisturiser with a higher SPF for winter. The lower humidity and central heating of winter can further dehydrate skin.

In the UK we do not all drive cars everywhere and our UV index can sometimes be very low, so the powers-that-be do not blanket recommend sunscreen year round as they do in Australia and the US. Vitamin D is a consideration.

I disagree with your conclusions. You seem to think teenagers are not adults. I argue they are adults but just without *experience*.  
While this means they often make poor decisions I'd argue that adults _need_ to make poor decisions to learn from them. Go find an adult that has never made their own decisions and you'll find someone incredibly immature.  
You ever know someone who was mollycoddled?

Overall he was probably one of the most immature individuals I ever knew, he was a nice bloke but his parents had kept him wrapped up too long.

Your maturity is based on what you're able to get out of life and arbitrary age lines don't accurately reflect that. I'd argue that these age lines can constrain maturity and keep our teenagers more immature than they could be.  

If we can clear out the noisy topics and just focus on the voting, I personally don't see how someone that is fifteen is going to more or less easily led than someone in their thirties or fourties.

Regardless, winning the Europa League wouldn't mean anything in terms of overtaking Liverpool.  Unfortunately, the system is broken and the top teams now are likely to remain that way indefinitely because success is almost entirely based on money (hence why Chelsea and Man City are the title favourites).  Liverpool are in the Champions' League, which pays a ridiculously higher amount of money in terms of winnings and TV rights.  Because of this, they will have more money to spend on infrastructure and expensive players.  Which they will in turn use to keep finishing in the Champions' League.  Even winning the entire Europa League brings in less cash than the early knockout stages of the Champions' League, IIRC.

Everton supporters don't do so for the prospect of winning trophies (although that will be nice someday), we do it because for some reason the club touches us in a special way.  Goodison Park is a strangely magical place, especially on match days, Evertonians are some of the most passionate, yet level-headed and knowledgeable supporters I've ever encountered, and our players are always modest and honorable, unlike so many others in the modern game.  As cliche as it sounds it really is more than just a football club.  That's why I'm not too bothered about Liverpool being a ""bigger"" club, and neither should you.

&gt; There is a lot (**A LOT**) of hostility towards Vlad right now. Maybe after these two games, rightly so. But, the fact is, he is not nearly as bad as everyone is claiming right now. I'd like to point out that he is coming off a back injury still because those are niggling injuries that hang around for a long time (Just like Lamela was, who everyone was happy to give the benefit of the doubt, I might add.) and he's being tossed around between right and left center back every game. 
&gt; 
&gt; On the notion of double standards between players, I'll compare him to Vertonghen and Lloris instead of Lamela since opinions can differ between attackers and defenders. Firstly, Vertonghen. Jan is probably the center back we have that is most similar to Vlad since they are both extremely comfortable on the ball and they like to roam forward. Fans applaud Jan's propensity to maraude forward with the ball but react poorly to Vlad's bombing runs forward. I'm not sure why this is, because he gets back quicker than Jan does to cover. Secondly, put your pitchforks away for me comparing him and Lloris. I'm not suggesting that Vlad is anywhere near Hugo's quality but I'd like to point out that Lloris is also very casual on the ball (a huge complaint about Vlad I see) and Lloris makes many risky attempts at the ball that he, luckily, has the ability to come out of on the winning side most of the time. Vlad is similar with his casual-ness with the ball and riskiness, but he's chastised for it.
&gt; 
&gt; Last season he was one of our better performing center backs before his injury. Players like Soldado who haven't exactly lit it up for Spurs are defended because he hasn't had a proper run, but Vlad hasn't had a proper run of games either so he's berated for his poor form? Very confusing. If anyone had watched him with Steaua in the Champion's and Europa League then they would know he is a quality player. There is a reason he is Romania's captain.

In the first 20 minutes Enrique was yelling at Sterling (and Markovic when they switched flanks) to help him as he was clearly getting overrun. Sterling did his best but seemed fatigued and Markovic straight up ignored him.

Stevie was upset with Migs about the lack of a shout when he got dispossessed, but to his credit I think Migs did say something but the crowd drowned it out.

Coutinho was visibly frustrated with Balotelli on a few occasions. You could tell Couts wanted him to make runs but Balotelli seemed to want the ball to feet. And like the article says, he did ""snub"" Rogers after being substituted.

There was more too, Henderson was pissed, Sterling and Balo had words. But overall I think it's more to do with a general frustration with how we're playing right now more than a lack of camaraderie in the squad. 

The players know we can (and should) be playing better. They're probably just as frustrated as the fans are, especially considering how well we were clicking at the end of last season. But I see it as a good thing. I remember the end of Roy's time how soul-draining it was to watch a team that collectively didn't seem to care whether we won or lost. At least now we have players that take pride in what they're doing and want to do better, even if it's not quite coming together at the moment.

You are right that Europa is a good bellwether for stepping up to Europe's premier competition, and we're not really coping very well with that.

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines. I have mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased because there are a host of decent actives in the formula and I was plain curious.

**Your opinion:** First time masquerading as The Invisible Man.

Plenty of serum: almost dripping when I took it out and a little left in the bottom of the sachet to cover the decollete and hands. The mask was too big for my freakishly small head, so would likely fit a male, but I did like that it covered the whole crows feet area since it is marketed for anti ageing. Couldn't get it to stay stuck around the hairline or on the neck, more of an annoying than a relaxing half hour.

After I let the serum dry my cheeks felt a little itchy and a little bumpy, but everything looked exactly the same as before. Will not risk repurchasing.

Not because I particularly want to slam our players or perpetuate some of the negativity on here, but simply because I feel there are some fairly well defined facts here.

**Adebayor** - look, we all know what he can do.  He alone was pretty much the difference between finishing top half or bottom half of the table last season.  He was great once Sherwood gave him a chance.  But there were reasons why he wasn't in the team to start the season.  Perhaps some of them were stupid and petty on AVB's part, but a lot of it had to do with him not being someone who works well for the team.

His best performances for us have always been under our loosest managers (Harry and Sherwood), who expect nothing of him other than just going out there and doing his thing.  He lacks discipline and focus when he's asked to perform a tactical function.

And he looks exhausted not because he's working so hard... it's because he's just gotten over malaria, didn't have a proper preseason, and spends far too much of the match pressing like a madman on lost causes that do nothing but waste his energy.  He just doesn't look mentally or physically fit to me, and for that reason alone he needs to be benched.  I want him to do well, but goodwill is not enough to get us where we want to go as a club.

**Vlad** - I didn't see all of this morning's game, so I'm not in a position to comment about it fully, but he's not a good defender.  He's a talented player with some quite obvious positive attributes, but that alone does not make a good defender.

Good CBs are solid, dependable and mentally strong.  Vlad has so many brain farts in a single match that it stresses us as fans out, so can you imagine how his teammates must feel?  How many times Hugo's heart must leap into his mouth because Vlad decides to do a Maradona turn on the edge of our penalty box?

I don't think we should junk him just yet, but he sure as hell is our riskiest defender, and since we just came off a season where individual mistakes made up a higher percentage of our goals conceded than any other team in the EPL, we need reliability and stability at the back, not a freaky loose cannon.",0,1412291998,null,0,false,0,ckyv9j9,t3_2i4tns,t1_ckyv9j9,t3_2i4tns,null,1426711850,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

Mind, our midfield has been getting miles better with Capoue consistently starting and with the introduction of Mason but it is still a lingering problem.

Some of the more competitive colleges like Trinity are harder to get into, but the application process, in theory, accounts for that with the pooling system so you should have an equal chance of getting into Cambridge wherever you apply.

That's a fact. The one match I remember Allen being apart of that we dominated was against Tottenham last year. Maybe I forgetting. But pretty sure he played in that match and played excellently. OTHERWISE the lad has not been anything for us. 

Perhaps someday when Gerrard retires and we have someone at DM who can offer a bit more all around the field, Allen could come to thrive. I'm not discounting that possibility. Obviously he came in well regarded from Swansea. But right now, with Gerrard in the first 11, our best team isn't close to being helped by Allen.

Rodgers is clutching at straws and that worries me. Because I do believe we'll come right and I think it's okay even if this year isn't a fairytale.

1. If the season is crap, Balotelli's gone, and Brendan gets to distance himself from the player and the committee that signed him
2. If Balo stays mediocre and yet the season somehow works out, Balotelli is gone next season, but Brendan gets to say he patched over a mess via his mad coaching skillz. 
3. If Balotelli ups his work rate and starts making runs, scoring, etc., Brendan keeps or sells him at a profit, and gets to proclaim himself the best coach in world football.

As I said, he definitely can and does run during the game, but it just seems to rarely happens when the situation calls for it.

We've definitely had problems getting the ball upfield, but I think Adebayor's willingness to drop deep is only hurting us in that department, because it prevents us from having a target man or a reliable outlet to really get the ball forward.  We can't play quick, direct, one-touch passes forward up the pitch because once it hits Eriksen or Lamela, there's no one further forward to pass to.  So then the ball goes backward or sideways.

And with Eriksen, he doesn't so much as sprint, but he does constantly make little darts into space between the lines, which is his job really.  He's never going to make a 50 yard run at the defence like Bale, so he plays to his strengths.

I'm not trying to hate on Ade and stick the boot in... I'm simply responding to some of the statements in the original post here that I disagreed with.

false,SandCatEarlobe,eng-Cheshire,Cheshire,"To provide a totally unsorted and incomplete list of policies:

* Free university tuition, and increased investment into both the research side and the teaching side of the universities: Reasons should be obvious.  

* Free school meals for all at all government-aided schools: Removes the need for means-testing which involves significant expense, eliminates the boundary case issues  

* National service, civil or military, at some point between 18 and 25 for a year or more, paid at the minimum wage with room and board provided, accommodations rather than exemptions for those with disabilities except in extreme cases: Gets young people to live away from their parents and train in something useful; provides an opportunity for those from bad homes to develop skills and ethics that were not taught at home; the state has a large group of people which it can deploy to projects like ridding every park in the country of cigarette butts; every NSer finishes with at least a year of work experience. 

* Increased investment in renewable energy resources and their development: Long-term national security issue, potential revenue stream   

* Increased agricultural subsidies and investment in rural communities: Food security is national security; and keeping rural communities alive is key to food security.  

* The creation of more council housing, to replace the stock sold off in the past few decades, and continued research into pro-social design: There is a shortage of high-quality, low-cost housing and a shortage of landlords who accept people on benefits; it has been shown that some designs of social housing generate anti-social behaviour, and further research is needed to learn how this can best be avoided or inverted.  

* Move NHS funding for alternative medicine to research if the alternative is not yet proven, to palliative care if it is known to be effective only as a placebo, and entirely if it is deleterious in any way: Far be it from me to take away whatever placebos the dying and chronically ill might benefit from, or to prevent the discovery of new medical techniques, but I cannot believe that it is right to dedicate our limited resources to helping conmen to fleece hypochondriacs.  

* Mandatory vaccinations unless a valid medical reason exists.  

* Free genetic screening and counselling for anyone who is capable of reproduction, and IVF with pre-implantation genetic diagnosis for couples found to carry genes that may harm their children if they conceive naturally: The incidence of congenital, life-limiting diseases could be greatly lowered, including the incidence of cystic fibrosis.  

* Provision of one-on-one tuition on a musical instrument for children from low income families in primary school, and assistance in renting or purchasing a practice instrument: Musical education is good for children, musical attainment is good for their university applications, and music is good for the soul. This would provide poor children with an opportunity that their middle-class counterparts have already.

* Eliminate death duties and taxes on gifts: The current system makes it unreasonably difficult to move money between family members.

* Increase consumption taxes on luxury products: When luxuries are well-classified, this set of taxes is progressive and does not result in a tax on Jaffa cakes.

* Treble the tax on cigarettes and raise the penalties on tobacco related smuggling offences, and raise a tax of 50p per unit of alcohol: Raised revenue will go some way to counteracting the social harm.

* Legalize and tax heavily the majority of controlled substances, and provide safe-use centres: Harm-reduction policies result in better social outcomes and smaller gaols than the current system. 

* Accommodating children in state residential care in an institutional setting for a minimum period of time before attempting a foster placement: Children from unsafe homes do better in family placements if they have received care aimed at preparing them for life in a safe home before actually being thrust into one, but it doesn't happen often enough because it doesn't look nice on paper.

* Higher petrol and diesel prices, and subsidies for electric cars: Clean air is nice to breathe; I want a Tesla.

* More separate bridle paths, especially in urban areas, and the provision of 'horse rack's beside bicycle racks: They're friendly, both to the environment and to most children, and we should really be encouraging sustainable transport.

* Shrink the prison system and increase the reformatory aspect: NS and drug legalization should reduce the number of prisoners, reducing overcrowding and freeing funds for use in reforming prisoners.

* Measures to increase the number of people who will be able to support themselves in old age without relying on the state pension.

* Consider raising the SDRT, or adding a separate tax upon uncertificated shares traded more than once a year: It's not that I want the market to be illiquid, it's that I want to raise the viscosity a touch.

* Stronger links with Commonwealth countries, especially with regards to increasing tourism and mutual business ventures: The West Indies are lovely at almost any time of year.

* Remain a part of the EU, but start making noises about reclaiming the Angevin territories: Russia cannot be allowed to be the only country in Europe making noise about reclaiming historic territory.

A few of these may not be entirely serious suggestions. I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader to work out which those are.

I'm not saying the way we ended up with him was ideal, but he could be great. We had different issues but they were similar in principle when we signed Suarez. It was a gamble in many ways. Last window we desperately needed depth and we got that, we needed someone who would or could potentially score 15-20 goals and we got that eventually. Would you rather have Balotelli or Welbeck? I mean, after we missed out on Sanchez we got as far as the medical table with Remy, had doors slammed shut with Higuain and Benzema, could never pay Costa or Falcao's wages, who else is left in the world in that tier that we could even conceivably sign? Don't say Reus. We had lots of contingency plans, we probably had more below Balotelli on the list, but we decided to take a risk on a player who has the capacity to be a world-beater. It's his last chance, as has been said (did anyone criticise Rodgers for that? It's still true) and maybe now *is* just the right time to remind him. I'm not a Rodgers apologist but I think this situation merits reserved judgement until we see how it plays.

I will be the first to agree with criticism if it's logical and warranted (which much recent criticism has been) but to me jumping on everything he does because of the way his words are framed in a newspaper headline (maybe not you but a lot of this thread) is counterproductive and isn't going to help anyone but our rivals. I apologise to /u/rydleo for letting my frustration about that come out in my earlier comment, I'm often sarcastic but it wasn't warranted.

Another thing I want to say and might as well say here, not really related; the players aren't the only ones who have underperformed. The fans have been nowhere near the level they were at last season, and if nothing else I would hope we can always get behind the team and help them rally. When we're on our game we've got the best support in football but when that doubt creeps in and things aren't going our way we drop off too quickly. We need our 12th man for 90 mins no matter the score, not just for YNWA and when we're winning and comfortable.",0,1412304724,null,0,false,0,ckz1d3r,t3_2i4qzb,t1_ckz1d3r,t1_ckyz6c8,null,1426708386,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

I put forth a list elsewhere in this thread of players I would have rather seen and I think would have been obtainable, obviously just my opinion, am sure many will disagree and would prefer Balotelli and that's fine.

Hopefully the naysayers like me are wrong and Balotelli turns into some sort of super-striker, though, as I would be happy to be wrong about something like that.

It was honestly shocking. The guy said some ridiculous things his first season at Liverpool and I took a lot of that to be an insecure guy trying to prove he's the right man for the job and a big club. So I was fine with that. I felt his media management improved a lot last season, even when we weren't at our best.

Obviously the media highlight what they will. If we were in the room or saw the whole interview we might even agree with most of what Brendan was saying, but he's been managing long enough now at Liverpool to learn how to avoid certain headlines.

Maybe this Balo stuff is him trying to motivate him. I don't know. Brendan has, also unfortunately, sort of let the cat out of the bag about not being a great man manager, for all the official Liverpool photos showing him laughing with the lads. 

Having been an athlete, I think it's always a true disappointment when a coach can't get the man management right. With most guys it isn't that hard. There are few Suarez and Balotellis. Mostly it's guys who want to play, who want to prove themselves, and who want to win. Sometimes that can't happen at your club, but this freezing out we've heard of is really disillusioning. 

It's also possible than BR needs to figure something out with the committee. Maybe players coming in aren't the players he wants. And I don't just mean on his dream list. I mean maybe someone like Sahko wasn't the player he wanted. But he still was fine pushing Agger out for him, so you have to think he was. And now to have taken Sahko out of the matchday squad? It's just not sensible stuff. And even if he had his reasons, he should put those reasons to the players.

Seriously? New emphasis on humor?  Humor has been part of the show for a long time.  It is nothing new, and it doesn't really feel like it is being emphasized more than it used to be.

As for your specific points, the arrow is quite ridiculous, but it is hardly the first time something this ridiculous has happened in the show.  

As far as the tension bewtween Danny and the Doctor, I thought it was handled really well.  It was a refreshing change to see someone that was instantly enraptured by the Doctor.  It was good to see challenge him and to see that he knew exactly how to push the Doctor's buttons to make him reveal his truly hypocritical attitude towards soldiers.  

As for Clara, we can't say her actions regarding dating are out of character because we really haven't seen that side of her character before.  We've seen her flirt with the 11th Doctor a bit, but that was it.  Beside, he seemed to much more insecure about it than she was.  Her main issue is that she kept saying blunt borderline insensitive things, but she has done that before.  Plus, it could be a side-effect from spending too much time with the Doctor.

I don't think EE gave the spectrum to 3 for that reason.

They then bought more in the auctions.

O2 and Vodafone also have a sharing agreement (although it's not as deep as the EE-3 one). Shame it hasn't changed much as far as their shit 3G coverage goes. They're almost as bad as each other.

His tactics were actually pretty effective, as you can see by our games against Chelsea (1st half especially, before Vert fucked up) and Southampton. 
   
The main problems with Tim were that he did not screen the back four (so our defense and especially Rose looked terrible), and that the players who were not brought through the academy did not respect/like Tim.

He's not the type of player that you'll really notice for anything great during a game, and that's fine. Instead you'll see other players around him playing better. He keeps the fucking ball. 

Keep the fucking ball and it will be easier to produce something. Keep the fucking ball, and it will be harder to be scored against. If we had him and Henderson playing now, Henderson would be able to played higher up- something that we kind of became accustomed to last year and that worked.

Another big problem - holding midfielder. Arteta is out. Flamini is not impressive this season, he will really struggle against our players and they have no other options. If we look to the attacking line, we will see that Ramsey is out and he is a key player of Arsenal. Walcott is not yet ready, but Oxlade is in real good shape, along with Welbeck and Alexis. Ozil looks like he is getting to his peak but who knows. And all of this poses a question for Jose. How should he play? He really likes to play on counters against big teams, but atm situation seems to be different. Arsenal's attack is in not so bad shape while their defence could really fail hard. So I'd prefer not to give the ball to them and put as much pressure on their defence as possible. Whenever they get the ball I'd try to take it back asap, not sitting on our half waiting for them to come.

Are people criticizing Rodger's comments on Balotelli?  Yes, because they are arguably worthy of criticism.  You may not agree and fair enough, we don't all have to have the same opinion.

Are people criticizing Rodger's tactical decisions?  Yes, because we're losing and they're trying to discuss (very hypothetically since none of us here can do anything about it anyway) things that might make us not lose.

Are people criticizing Rodger's signings?  Yes, because they are worthy of debate, although again there is nothing we can do about it.  You yourself say ""I don't think Rodgers knows how to best use the new players we have now at our disposal"" which, while I'm not sure I completely agree, implies that he bought badly or with little forethought as to how to fit the pieces he spent on together.

Are people saying Rodgers should or might be sacked?  Yes, because there's a chance it's what would happen if (a big if) results were bad enough regardless of how you personally feel about stability.  FSG have a lot more invested in the success of the club financially than I suspect any of us do and while I won't be standing there with 'Rodgers Out' signs, if we by some major misfortune were sitting near or in the relegation zone come Boxing Day, I certainly couldn't fault them for wanting a change.

In short, no, or at least not very many, are 'turning on' Rodgers, it's simply discussion about what is felt to be mistakes he is making.

I've had quite a few of the starter kits, they're not bad.  
  First I had was one of iTaste ones, they get a decent amout of vapour of of them but after a while it didn't really go the job. I had a Cool Fire 2, the one that looks like a grenade but it's fucking heavy, so I don't carry that around.  
  In all honesty, you can go cheap and use one of the battery packs from the cheapo ones you get in corner shops, the bit that makes a difference is the top that holds the liquid/juice.     
    
  As long as they have the same threading for the screw they work. The industry standard is 510 I believe.     
  
  My favourite top so far is the iClear30b. During the day I screw one of them onto a cheap USB rechargeable LIVID battery because it's small and lightweight.   
  
  I'd stay away from ones you have to get separate batteries and chargers for, they're just annoying in the end.  
  
  I've heard really good things about the MVP. Integrated battery and you can use it as battery bank for other usb devices.   
  
  Flavour wise, the vanilla one and the blueberry ones are really nice. The higher the mg the more of a throat hit you get, I find I can't go above 8 as I like to puff quite a bit and it makes my throat a bit dry.

I never 'broke into' the house - I opened a gate to look for a letter box - the rest is just invention to whip-up publicity and revenue from members.

The police said they would anonymise her statement prior to any trial to avoid witness intimidation from F4J. She has received numerous death threats from f4J supporters and from Matt O'Connor himself. There is no cover-up of an MPs involvement - merely justified witness protection. No charges were made against me because matt OConnor refused to cooperate with the police to provide medical evidence to justify his claims - mostly because his story falls apart when you examine it. In the video he shot he claims to have been 'smashed in the face' hard enough to be knocked over (and he is 16-17 stone) yet provides no photographs or medical evidence to back that claim up. Then he claims he was bitten and shows a photo of a cut thumb which looks like it was inflicted with a knife - NOT teeth. Yet he never claims on the video that he was bitten. Why? Because he was neither bitten nor punched - and made it all up to frame me. I however have evidence of a punch and grazing to the back of my head.

You guys are in a hot red form.. Everything's going right.

Let's check about us:

Defence:
Koscielny will be back after a minor injury. Mertesacker, Chambers and Gibbs will be there.

Kosc and Gibbs are the only ones performing well. Chambers is alright but not up to the notch. Per is not very competant for this match.

Honorable Mention: Sczezny gives up after 70th minute in most matches, in the last minutes, usually you guys have been subbing in Drogba. So I'm expecting a Drogba goal.

Midfield:

Our defensive midfielders have become a serious concern now. I'm betting that Matic will be the primary reason for your win. He is the difference. 

However, our 4-2-3-1 Formation with Cazorla and Flamini (who isn't good enough for this match) is somewhat effective IF Wenger uses this formation. This formation has been very effective against small/average teams (Aston Villa and Galatasaray). 

Ozil is doing well, if given the desired formation. 

Attack:

Preferably, we'll be having Ox-Welbeck-Alexis. A team of young men. Full of pace, somewhat good finish but a bad first touch. You give us the ball in the midfield and they'll swift through in. All is in your defence, where you guys are having the edge.


My conclusion:
It's going to be a bloody affair. I'm expecting 5-3/2. You guys win.

The reason children were abused by priests on such a large scale is that there was a culture within the church that said it was ok to have sex with young boys. 

The reason that there are so many cases of Pakistani men raping children is that there is a problem within many Pakistani communities in this country, which creates a culture that makes these men think that they can get away with these crimes. 

The vast majority of these men come from small isolated Pakistani communities which are poorly integrated with the rest of society. The cultural ideas that are incubated here have no place in our society. Things like the treatment of women, and and the appropriate age fro a girl to start a relationship with a man. 

If you create an environment where men think they are superior to women, that women should do as the are told by men, and that it is acceptable for young children to have relationships with older men, the of course that environment is going to be more likely to produce child abusers.

Perhaps engage your irony meter before blindly hitting downvote.

This comment was intended as a lighthearted parody of the general perception of police - that they NEVER do their job, are too lazy to attend calls, and would far rather be abusing their power over some poor punter, or esle actively ignoring child sex rings or allegations of rape or whatever else it is people suppose the Police spend their time doing.

In fact, incidents like this happen ALL THE TIME. Police do HARD work to catch criminals like this. And of course, they don't get it right every time. But you'd be surprised how often the police are in the right place at the right time, and get their man (or woman). Arrests like this are the product of hard work, luck and sometimes some very clever police work. This goes on day in day out, whether you're in Manchester or Burton under lyme.

""But what I can guarantee is that if the players buy into it, he'll be able to help them with mental preparation and make them understand how the mind works, especially when you're going into pressure situations.""

From Sterling:

false,ridlarehc,null,null,"I suppose you've read everything there is to read on [John Knox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Knox). For the context of my point of view, I was taught History in France, where secularism is a religion. I don't know about Scotland in particular, but I can give you what I understand about the rest of Europe.

In Germany and Switzerland, each has its own famous reform leader, namely and respectively Luther himself and Calvin. They turned Protestant through all sorts of wars, burning effigies or actual people, social crisis, etc. Reformation is no small business and many were attempted before Luther finally managed his.

Originally, it was not about refusing the Pope, as it soon became in England (but the English have a way of twisting everything). The point was to get back to a faith devoid of everything the over-powerful Catholics of the time had added to it: the ostentation, the downward spiral of power, greed and most of all the idea of buying one's way to paradise, pompously called *indulgence*. I'll let you read [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ninety-Five_Theses) for more about the start.

Once the idea of a religion with no intermediary between the believer and God was born, with everything it means from the translation of the Bible to the lower social status of clergymen and -women, it didn't need more than the very recent invention of the printing press to spread throughout Europe. The Roman Church had become too strong to keep itself in check and people were ready for a change.

Latin countries resisted the change for various reasons: Italy (or the many countries that made what is now Italy) had a strong link to the Pope, Spain's catholic faith had been strengthened over the years by invasions from North Africa and resistance against Islam, France had a ruthless Medicis as queen, with a temper ([the resistance to Protestantism was not smooth either](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Bartholomew%27s_Day_massacre)), and then [Louis XIV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Fontainebleau). The Irish refusal of Protestantism can be compared to what happened in Spain: an enemy with a different religion is a good way to reinforce Catholicism. Also, in poor areas, the Catholic Church had no means to be greedy or over-powerful (which explains the situation in the Highlands and Islands).

In Switzerland and Germany (or what would later become Germany), and I suppose in Scotland too, one leader (politically skilled and very eloquent) was enough to show the people the way to a simpler faith that granted a certain freedom at the time (it would be difficult to compare the practice of religion then with what we do now).

The Stuarts are not known for their strong Protestant faith. It was after all the (official) reason for their ousting and why the house of Hanovre now has the throne of Britain.

As for the current situation, Protestants are known in Belfast for their conservatism. In France, the same applies to Catholics, who will be in the streets again next Sunday to show their fear of everything from gay marriage to surrogacy (which will not be legal in the years to come), from immigration to Islam. They would hate the Jews just as much if WWII hadn't pounded a fear of anti-Semitism into our blood.

It is not the faith that leads to hate. After all, Christianity was supposed to be based on love.",0,1412327215,null,0,false,0,ckz82ib,t3_2i4doy,t1_ckz82ib,t3_2i4doy,null,1426705091,5,false,ScottishHistory,t5_2u68p,5

false,alister667,lfc68,,"I know that we need time to integrate new players, and I know that Brendan is a great young manager who stays at the club for the next 20 years, but... 

That performance against Basel was clueless. It looked like 11 decent players who'd never met before, being shoved out onto an oversized pitch. Here's the frustrating bit, Basel weren't that much better. Markovic was shocking, he looks so short of confidence it's hard to know if it's best to play him regardless or bench him and save him some embarrassment. 

When Lovren was signed I happily assumed that him and Sakho were a good quality central defensive pairing and would be for the next 5 years. They're both decent in the air, strong, and importantly, quick enough to press higher up the pitch, compressing the midfield when the opposition have the ball. In my head that was the case anyway. In reality they look very shaky and full of errors. I swear to god our defence might actually be vampires the way they react around crosses. And now Sakho appears to have fallen out with the boss and I suppose there's a greater chance of us losing a decent centre half.

Stevie looks slow and tired. Maybe it's a title push last year, a world cup (I know he ony played 3 games, but the preparation was bound to have taken it's toll), and another season starting with only a short break in between. I hope that's the case and not that his legs have gone for good. The problem is how does Brendan drop him? No man is bigger than the club, but no man is bigger than Stevie G is to Liverpool either.

The injuries, those bloody internationals, Sturridge, Can, Allen, all out. Suarez gone. This has meant our midfield has looked uncoordinated and disconnected to our front players.

I just want it to get better, quickly. I don't think it'll all change when Sturridge comes back. If we get Studge and Allen back then maybe. Sterling desperately needs a rest, but he's probably our most threatening player. At least to be fair to Balotelli the ball does seem to stick to him when it's played forward and he does have a decent shot on him, but questions remain about how he fits into our style of play. Lambert as well looks as though his legs have gone, and his mobility has left him. I think he was brought in as a cheap back-up striker, but he looked fairly inoffensive against Middlesbrough. 

Everyone knows it's vital we get top 4 again this year. Man City and Chelsea look to have the top 2 places to themselves which leaves us, Arsenal and the Scum to compete for 2 places.
 I'm worried that it will take another 2 months to get the new guys integrated, and we'll be left with too big a mountain to climb, pressure will grow on Rodgers, and we could end up losing what look so promising last year.

And it's making me irritable and a pain in the ass to be around.

Now that we've struggled for a couple of games, the reaction has gone the other way. It annoys me how much patience and belief everyone has *in theory* before the reality of what a difficult run is, becomes clear. Rodgers has got to get it right, but I for one am willing to give him the whole season to do so.

Leaving myself about 40-50 minutes, I thought this little stick would fill the gap nicely.

As for last night, I had the evening to myself so i thought i'd spend it smoking a big fat stick and enjoy the last vestiges of summer. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**MUWAT Bait Fish**

Petit Corona - 4x44  
accompanying beverage: blackcurrent squash.

**Impressions:** Very nicely constructed stick, with that gorgeous brown wrapper. the stick was firm to the touch with no deep thick veins or blemishes. 

**Smoking it:** i thought ""this little stick will be a nice quick cigar, and it can't be that strong"" my word was i wrong. this little sucker was a beast, 

Strong woody tastes - dark wood - with an intense , but not overpowering spice. A lot of thick smoke and a strong white ash, which i managed to get up to almost 2"" (half it's length).  

Despite the strong tastes there was a smoothness to the whole thing that just made it a very enjoyable smoke.

Unfortunatley I ran out of time before i could properly finish it (i think it's a good hour long stick). but wow. I cannot wait for the +11.

**Macanudo Cafe**

Torpedo (or is it a gordo?) 6x60  
accompanying beverage: Leffe.  

This cigar is the complete opposite of the Bait fish, where that was short, thin cigar with a dark wrapper and that strong taste, this beast is a weighty 6x60 stick with that wonderfully light coloured wrapper and a mild taste

**Impressions:** good construction to it, there were a couple of thicker veins, but otherwise it was near flawless. 

**Prelight:** a hay and creaminess taste to it. 

**Smoking it:**  After lighting it up, the taste is still a touch of hay, but overwhelmingly there's this wonderful creamy taste to it with a caramel/buttery flavour.   

The smoke was smooth and enjoyable to draw on - i actually had to slow myself down.  

Getting into the 2/3rd this spice starts to underly the taste i'm getting and as i continued into the last 3rd there's a light leather taste to finish it off.

I think you're confusing me with the poster above. I am not concerned that the UK will turn into a totalitarian state - I am concerned however that it will take a step backwards to something worse than what it is now, by stripping away an extra and useful layer of protection against state abuse. As you say, the UK has had a world-leading system of justice for centuries. But good for the 1700s does not equal good for the 21st century. I want us to remain a worldwide beacon for human rights protection - not simply settle for ""good enough"".

Moreover, I'm not sure I understand your position here. The ECHR is intended to protect the citizen against the state. So, while I can certainly see why Cameron would take a dislike to it, I'm not really seeing your motivation: why would you want the UK to remove a guarantee that's only there to help you? 

Perhaps more importantly, the UK's participation in the ECHR helps lend it its international legitimacy. If we pull out, why shouldn't Russia or Turkey follow our lead? And if they do, not only will that definitely have negative repercussions for the citizens of those countries, but will also worse diplomatic relations between them and western Europe and a time of perfectly sufficient turmoil. 

Look, I mean this in the least snarky way possible, but given that you don't seem to fully understand the difference between the EU and the Council of Europe or how they relate to each other, I have to suggest that you maybe don't really know enough on the subject to have a fully informed opinion. [Here's](http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home) the ECHR website. There's loads of information available for free there. Wikipedia also offers a slew of info. Browse through it.

I haven't said that we should ignore the issues in some Asian communities over the treatment of women. You are twisting my words simply because I don't want to look at the issue one dimensionally. 

What I *did* say is that the common problem is the lack of value the authorities place in young disadvantaged girls, which allows men in some Asian communities, or groups of politicians and celebrities, or religious groups to get away with abuse. By placing the sole blame on Asian gangs, you are ignoring the systematic problems which lead to these abuses, and condemning disadvantaged girls in the future to face similar abuse by other groups. 

You don't kill a tree by cutting off one branch, you need to go for the roots.

Who says I *want* to leave the EHCR ? The benefits of the EHCR are clear but I don't always agree with their rulings - there's a debate to be had as to how these rulings are enforced or followed. I've not got a firm opinion either way but I don't think the panic we've heard in the news is justified.

We have a fundamental difference of opinion. You seem to think that UK citizens can't trust the institutions that have been in place for centuries and that they need to be supervised by another institution.

I think that we have sufficient checks and balances in place to be able to manage our own affairs if required.

It's going to be OK Alister, just relax. Relax. 

Imagine you and your full backs, overlapping in a rainforest. Take a deep breath. It'll all be fine.

We have 3 or 4 of the most talented young players in Europe, we have a coach who's talented, flexible and came so damned close to doing the impossible last season. We've strengthened our squad, and it will take time to bed those players into our way of playing. Once we get those players playing, believing and dreaming we'll be damned near unstoppable.  

We're in the middle of a perfect storm, World Cup hangover, injuries to crucially important players, large number of new faces. We'll be OK once Brendan gets the system right, some imjured players back and the new players integrated. If any coach in the world can do this, it's Rodgers.

Our owners appear to know what they're doing. I know everyone is a little cautious about American owners after what happened, but FSG seem to have picked the right people, and (mostly) made the right decisions. The development of Anfield looks to be going ahead, and financially we appear to be on a stable footing. 

We're back in the Champions League, we've got a couple of games against Real Madrid to look forward to and if we get a couple of decent performances under our belt we could yet get to the knock out stages. Who knows what happens from then if we're able to play anything like we did in the second half of the season last year.

Lallana looks like he's getting up to speed, our goalie looks like he'll be getting some competition for his spot shortly, and Balotelli has looked skillful, hard working (!) and strong, we're just a little short of knowing how to exploit his strengths. Our two new Spanish fullbacks look to have filled a gap in both our attack and our defence.

A fifth of 8% is 1.6%. 1.6% of social workers want to quit because of stress of unmanageable case loads. Call me out on my ignorance, please, if that doesn't seem quite reasonable.

I really don't think you do. Everything else you write contradicts this. 

&gt; I don't see how you can insist that the UK institutions can't manage their own affairs without external oversight by the EU yet the EU institutions can.

I'm trying to understand, I honestly am, but you're not making any sense.

The EU institutions do not manage their own affairs without external oversight. That external oversight is provided by the European Court of Human Rights, that sits in Strasbourg. That Court is most important organ of the Council of Europe, which was founded in 1949 and which drafted the European Convention of Human Rights, which is the agreement which is enforced by the European Court of Human Rights. The Council of Europe has 47 Member States, including Russia, Turkey and Ukraine. 

The EU on the other hand, is an entirely separate supranational organisation. It was established in 1993 with the signing of the Maastricht Treaty having evolved from preceding European Economic Community (EEC). It has 28 Member States and does not include Russia, Turkey or the Ukraine. The EU has seven of institutions: the European Parliament, the European Commission, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU, which sits in Luxembourg), the Council of the European Union, the European Council, the European Central Bank and the European Court of Auditors. NONE of these however are or are related in any way to the Council of Europe or the ECHR.

The Council of Europe is different from the EU - the only connection is that the EU has signed the Convention and has committed to accede to the Council of Europe in order to provide European citizens with greater guarantees against abuses of power by the EU: it's relationship to the Council of Europe is therefore *identical* to the relationship that the UK has with the Council of Europe.

**The relationship between the EU and the ECHR is not like the relationship between the UK judiciary and the UK government. It is like the relationship between the UK and France.** 

**The relationship between the European Commission and the CJEU is like that that between the UK judiciary and the UK government.**

This is the issue, as it was in Rotherham; it isn't the police actively covering up abuse (although they'll try if it becomes public), rather it is them not listening to claims of abuse in the first place. Because these girls have no-one to go to, this abuse is allowed to continue. 

You stop the abuse from happening both by dealing with the issues in communities where abuse happens, *and* by enabling those who have been abused to go to someone. They are both factors, which I have said are both important, but you keep focussing on one and ignoring the other. By just 'dealing' with the Asian community where this abuse in Rotherham happened, you are not helping prevent abuse in other communities which are not Asian. By dealing with the issues within the police, you are helping prevent abuse across the board.

True but there is a reason why this is now significant now. With the huge number of people who registered to vote in the referendum, many of which have not been engaged in politics for decades, the prospect of the debt being collected is now more significant.

Aberdeenshire Council vowed to use this voter registration drive to pursue people.

This is an old tax from decades ago and it is grossly unfair for voter registration to be the reason for it to be collected. We want people to engage in politics and not exist in opposition to the system and this would be a significant setback for some people.

&gt;If he genuinely cared about doing the right thing he would have announced this back in 2011 when he first won a majority, not waited years until he realised it would get him some good press.

As I said just there, the reason he intervened now was more to do with the fact that voter registration was being used as a weapon.

If you think that being consistent with his opposition to the tax that he should have sorted it on day one of his 2007 Government then you have to remember that there were much bigger and more important issues to sort out at the time (1.3 million in 2009-10 was around 0.004% of the drafted Scottish budget that year). An issue like poll tax seemed so minor so there was little demand or time to address it.

I had taken a year out before it to work full time to save (just about) enough money for my degree. Unfortunately my university didn't offer any teaching assistant positions etc within my department. There were some students who did the ESRC Masters+PhD (4 years) and so received ESRC funding for their Masters and PhD - [this link has more information](http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/psychology/study-with-us/postgraduate/phd-by-research/phd-by-research.aspx).

Other than the career development loan that others have described, not sure what else to suggest. I do know of many who have lived at home with parents during their postgraduate education so that rent is cheaper etc.  Another possibility is to be a resident tutor etc in university's halls of residence - won't be free and you'll have responsibilities, but it might make accommodation, food etc a bit cheaper for a year.

Lets make it clear I disagree with your ascertain that saving is bad, spending is good, but if I took directly your statement above, that raising VAT would increase the price of non-food consumer products, which I agree with. Would then mean a lowering in consumer facing jobs, which I again agree, **but** there would be a greater incentive to increase R&amp;D jobs to create cheaper products to offset the increase - Just like raising the price of Carbon usage would create greener products - Raising the price of all non-food consumer products would force those products to be more efficient. I see this as a net benefit to UK plc.

false,ctesibius,UnionFlag,Various Triumphs,"If possible, get it welded. This can be done quickly and cheaply, probably without removing the pipe. Get the whole area as clean as possible beforehand otherwise the welder will have to do this and charge for the time. You'll need to ring around small independent car garages to find someone willing to take it on: specialist welders tend not to do repairs. The exhaust will tend to rust around the weld, so paint over it with rust-proofing compound. This will pass an MOT

The next best thing is exhaust tape. This is similar to the Gun Gum that /u/bougy mentioned, but it's in tape form and easier to use. You wet it, wrap it around the pipe, possibly cover with some aluminium sheet that they provide, and fix in place with steel wire that's also in the kit, as tightly as possible. Then take if for a ride. The heat sets the compound permanently. The down side is that you can't then weld the pipe. It's a one off fix that will last a few months to a year. It may or may not pass an MOT, but it's likely to be accepted providing there are no leaks.

When you can afford it, look at breakers for a Varadero pipe. There are plenty of them on line, or you can use an aggregation service like [this](http://partfinderuk.co.uk) to send out a query to a lot of them.

It means, for example, that the citizens of Moldova don't have to just rely on the good will of the Moldovan authorities, but also have 46 other judges (including, fwiw, a British one) overlooking the Moldovan authorities. And this is done not via the old authoritative imperialistic system that lacked any democratic legitimacy, but is authorised by the voluntary signing of the Convention by Moldova. 

To be clear: there is a lot to criticise in the Council of Europe. I am perfectly happy to agree with that. But those criticisms will not be addressed by the UK undermining the ECHR. What we need to be doing is working on improving the current system, not destroying it without having anything close to a better replacement on hand.

false,bruisedbollocks,newbadge,,"After a tricky start, I think this is our first really-really-must win game, and there probably won't be another game we'd be expected to win so much all season. Burnley really haven't invested much in their squad, and with last weeks 4-0 defeat to WBA, I think it is starting to show that they really only have the quality to be a good Championship team (I don't mean that disrespectfully at all as they were fantastic last season and fully deserved their promotion).

On the flip side, it is the first time that the onus really will be on Leicester to take the game to the opposition - it simply won't be possible for us to try and defend deep and counter-attack with pace like other matches, as Burnley will themselves be looking to back off and will probably be happy with getting a point away from home. This may be the downfall for us as it will require a different mindset compared to our other fixtures where we have been considered an underdog.

However, I think Nigel and the team are very professional and rigorous in their preparation and will have organised a solid match plan. What that plan entails, I have no idea because I unfortunately don't share such genius, but I think this could be a game where Mahrez and/or Knocky may be really useful in making progress down the wings and getting some crosses into Ulloa. If we score early, I think this could be a really good win by 3 or 4 goals. However, this is football (and Leicester City in particular!) and I'm rubbish at making good predictions.

If we were to lose this match, it would obviously be a blow to morale, however taking into consideration the start of the season as a whole, 8 points from 7 games would not be a disastrous start overall. Come the end of the season however, if we were to be relegated by less than 3 points, we would point to this game as a missed opportunity.",0,1412339799,null,0,false,0,ckzanu6,t3_2i4hrz,t1_ckzanu6,t3_2i4hrz,null,1426703743,3,false,lcfc,t5_2ukrz,3

false,DogBotherer,null,null,"Recidivism for many crimes _is_ high; recidivism for murder is very low as I understand it.  Clearly there are many reasons for that, a major one being that a conviction for murder in the UK means a mandatory life sentence that usually entails around 10-12 years in prison (much longer for certain kinds of murders) followed by a lifetime on licence.  The length of the sentence (which may make it harder to reoffend^*), the age upon release (young people are more likely to offend/reoffend) and the fact you are on licence for life, must all contribute to that low reoffending rate, as well as anything in the nature of the offence.   But, the nature of murder is such that, if we exclude the minority of murders which are driven by long term mental health issues which may be untreatable (some sexual compulsions, psychopathy, some schizophrenia), it is often a crime which comes about through extreme circumstances meeting particular psychological characteristics in a pretty unique way which may happen very infrequently in a human being's (even a convicted murderer's) lifetime.  Also, as people age, some of those psychological characteristics are prone to change, especially with rehabilitative efforts, and doubly so with close supervision.

Added to all the above, of course, is the fact that just because people have 'a clean record' doesn't mean they haven't killed, even committed murder, and/or don't share the same psychological characteristics and propensities.

false,Varniepoos,null,null,"In the month of September, I did a lot of lurking on this sub and MUA and I found myself seriously engrossed in everything that was/is posted. I can't help but lust after every product I saw/see. I wouldn't say I'm a beginner in the whole make-up thing, but I didn't know half as much as I did before discovering the MUA subs. I was a drug-store kinda gal, and scarcely explored middle/higher end brands as I was too scared in case I wasted my money. I also always used to apply make up with my fingers, ALWAYS. I couldn't imagine living without my Beauty Blender or brushes now.

I digress. So, like the novice make up addict that I am, hoping to expand my collection, I went out and splurged on a few things I would consider to be my new HGs so I will list a couple below. I also stuck to my trusty drug-store (Boots, Superdrug) products because a lot of them are as awesome as any. If anyone would like to recommend anything please feel free.

First purchase was my base. 
In need of a new primer (after losing my Clinique Superprimer Universal Face Primer. Sob.) I picked up Maybelline BabySkin Primer. Its pretty cheap (£7), and has the same consistency/texture as BareMinerals Prime Time which I think is around £20 give or take. I quite like that it's odorless, and doesn't seem to break my skin out. It is also really silky and my foundation doesn't cake with it, whereas my Clinique one made my foundation cake around the creases of my nose. However I find it can make my foundation ""melt"" later on in the day but no big deal/not really noticeable and I'm sure if I touched up with powder it will be okay. For now this primer is my HG and love the way it makes my skin feel.

The foundation I picked up was Estée Lauder Double Wear Stay-In-Place with SPF 10 (bonus!) And I have to say, I just love this foundation. It dries pretty quickly (esp. Without primer) but as long as you work quickly with it, its no real problem. The coverage is perfect for me and makes my skin look flawless. I think I will keep this in my collection forever more. Also the bottle makes me feel luxurious.

Not sure if brushes are considered products per sé, but I was just dying to try out RT brushes after all the raves they get. So I picked Real Techniques Core Collection and Real Techniques Starter Set. The Core Collection is so good it's unreal. I love applying my foundation with the buffing brush for a full coverage face. I use it everyday now without a fail. Also the contour brush is perfect for applying my blusher, which I will mention in a second. For anyone contemplating getting these brushes, for the price, they are amazing and you will not regret it! I haven't had much of a chance to play with the starter set, but as of now, I don't really like the angled brush to apply my eyebrows as the brush isn't dense/compact enough to get much definition - which was the main reason for buying this set. But I'm sure I'll find uses for all of them.

I heard a lot about Nars Orgasm blush, but decided to go for the famous Sleek dupe in Rose Gold. I love how pigmented the colour is with flecks of gold in there, I can tell that this is going to last a long time. The colour of the blush gives off a lovely lit-from-within glow and is perfect on the cheekbone because it highlights amazingly. For around £5 it is a massive steal. Although I want to try Orgasm, this is my HG blush for now. I will be trying some warmer Sleek blushes soon for an Autumny feel.

I was previously using Sleeks Eyebrow Kit, but after seeing all the raves about Anastasia Beverly Hills Dipbrow Pomade I decided I'd order myself one and see what all the fuss was about. (Ordered from Cult Beauty for anyone wondering). My god, I love this stuff. A little goes a crazily long way so don't overload your brush first time round, built up if you need to. My eyebrows, nearly (still working on growing them out etc.) look perfect thanks to this product and I am so happy I found it. I feel like even if I find something else I will always go back to this as my HG as it is perfect in every way. I apply with my ELF angled brush (£3?). Love.

And finally, I ordered my Naked Palette 3 last week and it arrived today (eek!) So I will be playing around with it with my RT starter set and hope that this will be part of my HG list and daily routine.

These are just a few things I bought that are definitely worth the mention, so if you get the chance to, definitely try them out!

Fact is, London is fucking expensive. People earn more there, but it's still proportionally more expensive to live there. To live in CENTRAL London is even more expensive. If people actually READ the article, they'd see things like these part was down:

&gt;the “affordable” units will cost no more than 60% of market rents in the area and will on average have a discount of 44%.

But still - the Guardian will push the £2800/month (which is *up to* by the way) and the ""Boris doesn't want poor people inside London"" quote for all it's worth. In the meanwhile, I'd say that a 44% discount from the market rate isn't bad at all.

* Increased funding towards research.
* Continue investment to emerging economies - bringing economic standards up across the globe benefits us in the long term, since strong countries = strong trade partners. Investment would be strictly audited however - the money should go towards improving economic infrastructure, not military.
* High tax rates for those earning more than £150k
* Any bank that has had to be bailed out in the past 5 years will be unable to provide bonuses.
* A long term investment into other cities in the UK - maintaining London as the centre for the entire economy is simply not sustainable and it would be a net benefit if growth is equally distributed across the country.
* A review into the auditing process used for public bodies.  In particular, I would be for more controlled budgets where expenditure must be backed by need and analysis (such as evaluating the supply and demand of drugs/hospital beds/equipment etc).
* Greater transparency in how money is spent.  Any body funded by the tax payer must produce a publicly accessible year report giving a breakdown on how that money was spent.
* End back-to-work schemes and unpaid internship.  A person cannot be forced to work without being on a payroll.
* Adjust minimum wage in line with the cost of living.
* Every company must submit its payroll to the government on a yearly basis. Any company found to disproportionately give a lower wage to any particular group will be heavily fined (this addresses both the issue of the gender pay gap as well as the issue of low-skills immigrant labour)

**SOCIAL**

* Police must wear portable cameras, in order to protect both their own safety, and the safety of others
* Promote LGBT* equality - review all existing laws and remove all discrimination.
* Remove tax exemptions for place of worship
* Require all landlords to be registered in order to let a house. Registration would require an annual members fee - a landlord can only charge rent that is proportional to the cost for the living space (for cases where the property was bought and then refurbished into flats, the cost for rent of the flat would be based on an appropriate fraction of the cost of the property).
* Increase support for community policing and neighbourhood watch schemes
* Promote inner community dialogue in local communities, it is possible to be multicultural and not be stuck in what are effectively ghettos.. A dialogue between different ethnic community should help build trust in the community as a whole.
* A justice system based on rehabilitation instead of retribution.  People who commit crimes are troubled, and something should be done about that.
* Increased provisions for mental health care - the way mental health is handled in this country is a joke...
* Policies introduced based on scientific review and evidence, rather than emotion.

**WELFARE**

* Scrap the bedroom tax
* Make the job centre more effective - increase funding to get properly paid staff who can help job seekers get the job they actually want, and improve provisions for training courses. Essentially making the job centre a proper public recruitment agency with a more personal touch.
* An organised crackdown on welfare fraud
* However a relaxation and increase in the entitlement of welfare - the majority shouldn't have to suffer because of the actions of a few.

**INFRASTRUCTURE**

* Preserve the NHS at all costs
* Public bodies to run rail and utilities. These bodies should be run under a non-profit policy - i.e. all fares and bills must be invested directly back into the infrastructure.  Any surplus at the end of the financial year is reimbursed to the taxpayer.
* Internet to be considered an essential service. 
* Long-term plan to introduce contactless payment throughout the country.
* Expanding the underground beyond Zone 6. 

**MILITARY**

* Scrap Trident, replace it with something more cost effective
* Tone down GCHQs creepy stalkerish-ness

**ENVIRONMENT**

* Invest in off-shore wind farms and nuclear energy
* Tax subsidies for electric/hybrid cars
* Promotion of driverless cars

**POLITICS**

* Referendum for Proportional Representation, with a strong campaign for yes
* Full federalisation, England split into 6 devolved regions.
* Referendum on membership of the EU - with a campaign for staying in.
* More cooperation with the EU, ending some of our exemptions - with a long-term plan to support EU centralisation.
* End of the Government vs Opposition dynamic in parliament.  Winning the most seats doesn't mean you represent the views of the entire UK, it means you represent a larger percentage of the views of the entire country.  The prime minister would of course be from the winning party, but the cabinet would be assigned such that the makeup proportionally represents the house of commons. Everyone in the house of commons represents the views of the people and there needs to be more corroboration between everyone. 
* Cabinet positions filled on merit - you can only become chancellor if you have economics experience.
* The public have the right to propose a motion of no confidence against the government.

**FOREIGN POLICY**

* More open criticism of countries deemed to be in violation of human rights - including sanctions
* Standing up for the principles of UN conventions - with a more heavy handed stance towards those who violate the principles the UN was founded on.",0,1412341765,null,0,false,0,ckzbaa4,t3_2i2zps,t1_ckzbaa4,t3_2i2zps,null,1426703452,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Most other European countries are in the Schengen agreement and they are considered a separate travel zone. So I must leave the UK/Irish travel zone and go to the Schengen travel zone in order to be considered to have left within my ninety day allotted time so that I may then be considered for return to Ireland.

false,drhuge12,null,null,"I'll post a relevant (and relatively short) extract from my undergraduate thesis. It wasn't about the Reformation *per se* so my treatment of it is somewhat cursory but I think it's a good place to start if you're curious. The source for much of this extract was Gordon Donaldson's *Scotland: The Making of the Kingdom, James V – James VII*. It's a tad dated but still quite good. Consequently it focuses much more on the diplomatic/political aspects of the Reformation than on theological/ideological aspects: he describes the Reformation as part of a broader realignment in Scottish politics away from France/Rome and towards England (though try not to fall for the teleology of Union here). If you're curious about those bits, find yourself a good biography of John Knox.

&gt;The premature death of King James V in 1542, from a fever following a disastrous war against the English, precipitated a troubled succession. His only surviving child was his daughter, Mary, born a mere six days before his death.1 The Earl of Arran (later the Duke of Chatelherault), a noble from the powerful Hamilton family that had close blood ties to the royal family, became governor (regent) of Scotland. He was aligned with the pro-English faction of the nobility, and declared himself sympathetic to the aims of the ongoing Reformation in England and personally renounced the Pope's authority. In these things, he was supported by Scottish nobles recently released from imprisonment in England by the ruthless Henry VIII in exchange for political support.2 
&gt;Arran, however, was brought back to the Catholic fold by the pro-French and staunchly Catholic Queen Mother and other nobles, especially the Earls of Angus and Lennox, in 1543, and given the French title of Duke of Chatelherault for his trouble. This about-face led to an English invasion in 1545, this one soundly defeated by the Scots at Ancrum, on the Border.3 The French alliance was sealed by the marriage of Mary to the French dauphin, the sickly Francis II, in 1558.

&gt;	Spooked by Mary's marriage, a group of nobles styling themselves the “lords and barons professing Christ Jesus” threatened the French connection by advocating for reform of the Scottish Church and for more preaching, with support from the new Protestant Queen of England, Elizabeth.4 Queen Mary, by now a participant in the administration of her kingdom, had up to this point attempted to hold a conciliatory and moderate position on religion, but shifts in international politics led to the diplomatic isolation of England, and thus, an obviation of the need to conciliate English interests in Scotland. When Mary began slowly to crack down on the burgeoning Protestant movement, the Scottish Protestants responded with an increased militancy and fervour.5 In addition to this, the return of the fiery reform preacher John Knox to Scotland from exile and imprisonment in France was not conducive to continued peace. 
	
&gt;In May 1559, the first successful Protestant revolution in Europe began. Nobles and gentry openly protected Protestant preachers in defiance of the crown, and friaries and monasteries were served with so-called 'Beggars' Summons' to abandon their convents so that the poor might have lodging. The crown, supported by French troops and money provided by Mary's husband King Francis II, fought skirmishes with the Lords of the Congregation (the name adopted by the band of Protestant nobles that coordinated resistance and propaganda), who were backed by the English, and control of Edinburgh passed back and forth between the crown and the nobles. John Knox and others argued that their resistance was constitutionally permitted, because “the reformation of religion . . . doth appertain to more than to the clergy or chief rulers called kings,”6 and that therefore the nobles of the realm should have a say in the reform of the church.  When the Lords sat to negotiate with the English for aid, they proclaimed that they had revolted “for maintenance and defence of the ancient rights and liberties of the country.” As was common for noble revolts in Europe, and especially in Scotland (as we have seen), resistance to central authority was justified using conservative language.7 

&gt;	In July of 1560, after hostilities had ended and French and English troops had departed for home, the so-called 'Reformation Parliament' met in Edinburgh. The Reformation Parliament promulgated a new confession of faith (the 'Scots Confession'), and on August 24, it voted to abolish the Roman church in Scotland. Queen Mary neglected to ratify the acts passed by the Reformation Parliament, but they were the de facto foundation for the Scottish Church after 1560, with royal assent or not. 

&gt; 	The next seven years were very politically difficult for Mary. She had been raised in France, and did not know her country well. She clung to Catholicism while the rest of the country moved against it. Finally, her hand was greatly weakened by her husband Francis' death in December 1560, leaving her without foreign allies. She was not without friends at home, however, and the ardour of the Lords of the Congregation cooled over time. Several of them began to curry favour with the (now marriageable) Queen. Over the next seven years, she would be married twice; her first marriage to her kinsman Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, ending with his murder by Protestant nobles, and her second ended with the flight of her husband to exile and imprisonment in Denmark in the second revolt against the Queen in 1567. This second revolt was precipitated in part by the unsavoury character of her second husband, the Earl of Bothwell, who was suspected of murdering Darnley. When he fled the field at Carberry in 1567, where Mary's army melted away during negotiations between the rebellious lords and the crown, Mary surrendered and was forced to abdicate in favour of her young son James.",0,1412343116,null,0,false,0,ckzbrvv,t3_2i4doy,t1_ckzbrvv,t3_2i4doy,null,1426703196,2,false,ScottishHistory,t5_2u68p,2

I suppose what really matters is the proportional increase in likelihood for an ex-convict to commit murder versus someone without a criminal record.

I agree that the highly specific motives for murder in many cases mean that it is less likely to lead to reoffending than other crimes i.e. in most murders the victim is known to the offender and there is some specific cause that motivates the murder, this is less likely to reoccur than say assault in which the victim can more often be less-specific and it can simply be due to aggressive temperament of the offender.

* Stopping contempt of court from infringing on freedom of the press (Sunday Times v UK)
* The mentally ill who voluntarily commit themselves to an institution are owed the same duty - suicide watch etc - as those who are sectioned (Rabone v Pennine Care)

The media, to a manager, is another section of the job.

**Your opinion:** It's a tiny teeny tube with a viscous gel that is impossible to spread on dry skin. I found that a mist of hydrating toner before REALLY helps to spread the stuff. It leaves an odd tacky feeling on the skin but I suppose that's their *special hydro-gel formulation* 


**Ingredients:** *Nicotinamide 4% w/w.*Aluminium Magnesium Silicate, Hypromellose, Citric Acid, Macrogol Lauryl Ether, Ethanol, Purified Water.

--------------------------------------------------------
**UPDATE:** *I've finished the tube which lasted a month, and I have to say I won't be re-purchasing. It's difficult to spread and leaves a less than desirable finish on the skin. I've seen more reduction in PIH in one week of using the Simple KTS Toner than the entire month of using the Freederm gel. My brother who is dealing with PIH from cystic acne and the occasional whitehead didn't see any difference either.*",0,1412345520,null,0,1413745809,0,ckzcr0m,t3_2gvut7,t1_ckzcr0m,t1_ckmza8r,null,1426702741,2,false,SkincareAddictionUK,t5_32evd,2

Another thing that really annoys me in this subreddits criticism of Brendan is that he is criticized for things where we don't really know what's going on behind the scenes. The Sakho incident is a good example. Sakhos does something which you shouldn't do when you play for a big club like Liverpool. Rodgers tells the press that they have talked about it and they move on. But then this sub starts to think that Brendan has mismanaged him and has lied about him being injured, and that he should apologize to Sakho. Really? A players steps out of line and suddenly our manager is the bad guy. Don't think this sub would've said anything if results were going our way recently.

Trained up, traded out 

Profitable Academy graduates: 

Luke Shaw (18 yrs old, Manchester United, £31m) Adam Lallana (26, Liverpool, £25m) Calum Chambers (19, Arsenal, £16m) Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (17, Arsenal, £12m) Theo Walcott (16, Arsenal, £12m) Gareth Bale (17, Spurs, £10m) 
Many people expected the Dutchman would face an impossible job to surpass Mauricio Pochettino, the coach who led Southampton to eighth in the Premier League last season – especially when several of the club's star players also left in the close season. 

But so far Pochettino has barely been considered by Saints fans, as Koeman has built an impressive new side which lies second in the league. During pre-season, the Dutch manager made some astute signings with the captures of Dusan Tadic, Graziano Pelle and Shane Long, and he arranged loans for players like Ryan Bertrand and Toby Alderweireld. Alongside those, he has tried to implement players from the club’s academy. 

Lucrative youth 

Promoting youth seems to be a cultural commitment at Southampton, where there is a clear tradition of producing many players so talented that richer clubs make offers fit to test a Saint. 


No wonder other clubs are trying to copy the Saints' academy, according to Matt Crocker, who was Southampton's academy director from 2005 until 2013: ""I think there are a lot of clubs looking to Southampton and the way they implement young players. 

""They're a good example of a club who plays in the Premier League, made a lot of money from player sales and still have good players who didn’t cost them a lot. So in that way they are a model club to other sides."" With Financial Fair Play applying strict criteria on spending, only the huge clubs with enormous income streams can afford to spend big, leading to ever more importance on promoting from within. For the vast majority of European clubs, Saints represent the blueprint. 

“""Other clubs with financial problems usually cut back on academies. Even in administration, Southampton didn't""

- Matt Crocker, Southampton's academy director 2005-2013 

Crocker, now the FA's Head of Coach and Player Development, explains how the youth structure has always been integral to Southampton. ""The club has a philosophy to give young players a chance,"" he says. ""The door has to be open for them. 

""When the club faced administration, the academy was still funded to the level which it used to be. Other clubs with financial problems usually cut back on academies, to save money – but Southampton never cut back the youth programme."" Giving youth such importance could be crucial for the future of English football. 

Situation normal for Koeman 

“""It’s Feyenoord's goal now to implement two youth players in the first team every season"" 

- Damien Hertog, Feyenoord’s academy director 

For his part, Koeman is no stranger to involving young players in the first team. In his previous job at Feyenoord, he gave debuts to many young players due to the precarious financial situation of the club. 

It turned out to be a success, as Feyenoord were Eredivisie runners-up twice in three seasons. Damien Hertog, the club’s academy director, tells how financial uncertainty created a new club ethos. ""It’s our goal now to implement two youth players in the first team every season,"" he explains. 

""That policy became even more important when Mario Been [Koeman’s predecessor] was manager. At that time, financially there was nothing possible at all. But ever since then, we have kept that new policy."" 

When Koeman took over in 2011 – thereby becoming the first man ever to play for and manage each of Dutch football's big three clubs, Feyenoord, Ajax and PSV Eindhoven – he didn't have a big budget, but was able to make some minor signings and favourable loans. 

His biggest hits were Manchester City loanee John Guidetti and Pelle, whom he bought from Parma after an initial loan spell of six months – and no wonder: in total, the Italian hit 55 goals in 66 games for the Rotterdam club. Alongside the incoming players, Koeman used a lot of youngsters, notably Jordy Clasie, Daryl Janmaat (now at Newcastle), Tonny Vilhena and Jean-Paul Boëtius. 

The new Feyenoord 

Feyenoord's squad includes 14 Academy graduates: Wessel Dammers, Rick Karsdorp, Rodny Lopes Cabral, Lucas Woudenberg, Jean-Paul Boëtius, Sven van Beek, Matthew Steenvoorden, Elvis Manu, Anass Achahbar, Terence Kongolo, Tonny de Vilhena, Jordy Clasie, Miquel Nelom and Erwin Mulder 



Hertog says Koeman kept in constant contact with the Feyenoord academy. ""He was always listening to youth coaches and other staff. 

""I have a very positive feeling how he worked here in the last three years. He frequently visited youth matches, which meant he had a good view of the level of the players. 

""During winter training camps, he would always take a few youth players with him. That was really constructive, he was really involved."" 

According to Hertog, the results in the last few years speak for themselves. ""We have all seen how he developed those young players even more, and how he implemented them in the first team. And he never said that he wanted to make big signings from other clubs; he always stayed cool, and that gave us confidence in the academy as well."" 

Academy awards 

Koeman presented himself in a similar way at Southampton. He didn’t complain when so many big players left the club, as he was mainly focusing on building a new team. 

And Southampton will be glad he is familiar with nurturing new talent as well. In recent years, academy players have played an important part in the success of the club. 

""Usually we sold our good players,"" reflects Crocker, ""but when the new owner [Markus Liebherr] bought the club, the ambition was to keep the good players, to reach the Premier League and to transform the players into internationals for their country."" 


That dream came true in 2012, when Southampton returned to the Premier League after seven years. Since then, several academy players have impressed in the top flight, and some have gone on to make their international debut as well. Crocker proudly reels off the names. 

“""The Southampton academy shouldn't only be regarded as one of the best in England, but as one of the best in Europe"" 

- Matt Crocker 

""If you look to the last two seasons in the Premier League, there were Adam Lallana, Calum Chambers, Sam Gallagher, Luke Shaw, James Ward-Prowse and Harrison Reed who came from the academy. 

""And most of them consistently played in the first team. That’s just outstanding. If you consider the players who have progressed before, like Gareth Bale and Theo Walcott, then I think the Southampton academy shouldn't only be regarded as one of the best in England, but as one of the best in Europe."" 

In Holland, academy excellence is so important that there's a category for it at the annual Rinus Michels Awards – and Varkenoord, run by Feyenoord in association with Excelsior, has taken the gong for the last five years on the bounce. It’s a significant victory, according to Hertog. ""First of all, you have to be shortlisted by the Dutch football association. In the end, all clubs mutually vote for the winner."" 

Hertog explains how the Feyenoord academy distinguishes itself. ""What makes us unique is the continuity and diversity of the training staff. There's a lot of knowledge within the academy about different age groups. We think it’s important to give the youngest kids space to explore their responsibilities in an open way. 

""An example is to give two players the task to make teams for training. We hope they develop creative skills by themselves. Later on, from the under-12 group, we apply a more strict approach to players. We have some very good managers, who have created a specialism to work with certain age groups. In that way, we have created experts, and I think that is really important."" 

""It enhances the mutual feeling"" 

Like Crocker, Hertog emphasises on the important role of the academy inside football clubs. ""At Feyenoord, the youth academy has always been mentioned as one of the big assets."" And as at Southampton, Feyenoord didn't sacrifice the future when the present brought huge financial problems. Hertog recognises the similarities with the South Coast club. 

""With its youth structure, I think Southampton is one of the exceptions in England. I like to see it, it feels the same as we are doing in Rotterdam. It makes you feel really proud as a club, when home-grown talents play in the first team. It makes for a connection inside the club, it enhances the mutual feeling. In Holland, academies tend to become better and better, and I think it will develop even more in the coming years."" 

Perhaps more clubs in England can follow the example of Southampton and Feyenoord. Crocker is already trying to implement changes at the FA, where he is part of a team which aims to define a new technical approach towards the game. ""We're trying to create a new DNA of English teams, like a standardisation of how we want to play.""",0,1412347195,null,0,false,0,ckzdjbg,t3_2i645s,t1_ckzdjbg,t3_2i645s,null,1426702374,8,false,SaintsFC,t5_2tboa,8

But no matter how busy he gets with England's future, Crocker still finds time to keep an eye on his old club and says he is impressed with the work Koeman is doing. ""They had a very difficult summer, but they signed some excellent players. Koeman has done a great job, during challenging times. 

""And also under Koeman, Southampton seem to continue with the same approach to young players. They got Ryan Bertrand on loan from Chelsea, and this season have already brought a new debutant from the academy in Matt Targett."" 

It seems Southampton will continue to set the precedent and be a model club.

The job is shit. Don't do it.

You break your back, I mean, you can and do get injuries. Long hours (if you take them), bosses constantly pressuring you, manipulating you and even harassing you into covering shifts. Pay is nothing great, incredibly underpaid for the job. Commonly understaffed, tiredness of long hours and simple stress means you can't deliver to the standard you'd want to, which in turn plays up in your mind...

Do you want to do it? It's an incredible experience, humbling, will make you think of life differently, and what kindness is and just how very important your smile can be, especially when things are bad, when you are sick and tired and angry.

But is not a job to stay in for long periods of time. No point, no prospects, shit pay, boring, depressing. I never want to do it again, after 5 years total, both in 1 and 5 stars (CQC) homes. Still don't regret it though.

Drawback: The 'scary' robots looked a little hokey when I first saw it back in 2007(?) so I'm not sure it'll leave the best impression aesthetically, and it is a bit confusing being dropped in the middle of the Rose/Mickey/Doctor situation.

Personally, I think that ""The Eleventh Hour"" is the best place to start because it was made to get the audience loving and appreciating Matt as 11. It requires almost no backstory, has the madcap, run-around feel of the show, some classic ass-kicking, and the invitation to run away with him at the end. BONUS: Hopefully she will want to watch more and she will be in a good place to continue.

Vincent and the Doctor is also an excellent choice because it's pretty much a self-contained episode with LOTS of feels, but if she's not familiar with what happens to Rory, it may not be the best place to jump in as it might spoil the emotional impact of his story, in particular. 

My last recommendation would be ""Silence in the Library."" It's a two-parter, nice and creepy, huge feels, no backstory needed, and sets the stage for what's to come in 11 timeline.

I think there is a better option.

An alcoholic, who also requires both, has to come to terms with it and admit his problem first - as must a paedophile. This is far more likely if you view efforts to resolve the problem as a positive step.   

In that case, the paedophile would also be supported by the understanding of friends and family to keep him away from temptation. It would also mean he can easier accept the fact that certain jobs are unavailable to him.

1) Most importantly, posts like these are often easier to find than the posts that they are criticizing. I have seen very few people wanting to 'sack Rodgers', though I have seen critical comments regarding Rodgers, which in my opinion is entirely justifiable. The man is not a God. He makes mistakes. We are allowed to spot them.

2) Some people on this subreddit think they are much more representative of the fanbase than they actually are. They aren't. I really do hope I don't sound snobby, but if you go to a match you will seldom find any fan declaring their complete lack of faith in Brendan. The feeling is very much that he is the man for the job. There was a similar misconception about Rafa before he went. The media felt we wanted him out when actually the general consensus amongst the fans was that he should stay.

3) The very, very few people who are of the opinion Brendan should go are not the same people who praise him each week. on websites such as this it is very easy to see people as a collective rather than individuals. After a loss, it is obvious the pessimists will be much more vocal than after a win. And visa versa, when we win the pessimists are much less likely to post about how terrible we are (which we aren't).

false,unnatural_rights,num23,,"The issue I have with pointing simply at Roberto Soldado's lack of goals as evidence is: how many league minutes has Soldado had this season? *Less than 45 minutes total*.  He was brought on for 10 minutes against QPR and around 30 against West Brom.  He's scored two goals, neither of which was in the league - 1 against Limassol and 1 against Forest.  If you include his appearance against Besiktas, that's 2 goals in 4 non-league starting appearances.  Not stellar or anything, but not horrific.

Here's the thing.  He's a poacher. You can't just throw him into a match and expect him to pull goals out of his ass like a wizard, he needs dedicated playing time with a solid and stable supporting lineup of attacking midfielders who he can both assist (as he has amply demonstrated an ability to do) and who can assist him, feeding him goals that he will slot in with ease. Even the goal he created from Townsend in the match against Forest required him to stretch wildly and unnecessarily.

But he's not had proper service at all this season, and he's not been given sufficient minutes to build up match rapport with the rest of our outfield.  I understand that Besiktas are no pushovers and he played against them for more than a full hour, but I think we all know that league play is different from continental or cup play, and it's the key goal for any side in our position to succeed in the domestic league system. So let's compare Soldado to Emmanuel Adebayor, who couldn't hit a barn door right now for love or money.

&gt; * Adebayor has had 6 appearances this season, all in the league.

&gt; * Soldado has had 6 appearances this season; 2 in the league.

-

&gt; * Adebayor has scored 1 goal this season, against QPR.

&gt; * Soldado has scored 2 goals this season, against Limassol and Forest.

-

&gt; * Adebayor has a combined 500+ minutes of league play thus far.

&gt; * Soldado has less than 45 minutes of league play thus far.

Soldado needs to be called up to play in the league. He hasn't been given a fair shake this season and criticisms of him that ""he isn't scoring when he's given minutes"" are ludicrous when he's had less than a single full half of league play split over two appearances. When he plays he shows flashes of the brilliance we signed him for, making space for runs toward the goal, showing an admirable lack of selfishness on the ball, supporting all the other attacking players with passes and crosses and as a distraction for the opposing defense while *still* looking ready to score.  He needs time to build cohesion with an attacking midfield line-up that he can communicate with and get assists from. Lamela in particular. Adebayor, on the other hand, is an embarrassment right now when it comes to his workrate and build-up play.

There is a serious imbalance in league minutes, and Soldado deserves to be given a chance to prove himself.  If he doesn't succeed after being given an *actual shot* at success - regular league starts, shows of confidence similar to those being shown by Pochettino in support of Adebayor, calls for ""patience"" and so forth, etc - then I will be deeply disappointed but I won't weep to see him leave the Lane.  But the way we're playing him right now (meager minutes, inconsistent deployment from the bench, subbing off *after scoring a fucking goal*) is a recipe for deep-sixing the man's career, and it will be *the club's fault* if he's branded a failure.  Not his.  The club's.

When the Nazis started threatening Jews we stopped more people moving to the holy land. When we discovered that Jews were bieng exterminated our focus remained ending the war rather than stopping genocide. After the war when those victims fled to the national home we had promised we turned boatloads of holocaust survivors away. We then ran away in 1947 and left a vaccume which resulted in war. We then encouraged the Israelis to attack Egypt in 1956 so that we could 'intervine' to recover the Suez Canal. This was a complete disaster and we ended up proving entirely unreliable allies in the face of american opposition. We then promised to ensure Israel's waterways. When Egypt closed the straits we pledged to keep open ten years later we took no action whatsoever and proved entirely and completely impotent to the point that Israel felt it had no option but to attack early in 1967.

In short, we have betrayed pretty much every promise we have ever made to Israel while has often resulted in their mass murder. We have failed to protect them when we have pledged to do so.

It depends on if your skin can handle it. Did you drop down to once a day because you felt you were over exfoliating? Some people use it twice a day no problem, I personally find that when I used mine twice a day my skin felt too dry. Once in the evening is the sweet spot for me. Make sure you wait 20 mins or so to get the full benefit. That may be enough.

**2) What would be a better cleanser for the morning than the tea tree scrub? (cheap thing I picked up at Boots and have been using for a long time)**
Does the tea tree scrub make your face feel tight? Does it have microbeads? If the answer to either of those questions are yes then this product might be too harsh (either drying you out, causing your skin to produce more oil, or it may be too much physical exfoliation for you) if the answers are no then it sounds like it's good to use. Again, using myself as reference, I find any foaming washes too harsh for my skin (I think my skin is dehydrated, I get pretty oily but lots of stuff seems to dry out my skin) so I tend to go for cream cleansers or cleansing balms which I use to double cleanse just in the evening after my OCM.

**3) What's a good (not too expensive) sun cream to use, as mine is running out?**
Depends on what you're looking for! La Roche Posay ones come highly recommended (there are lots of different formulas) and you can buy them in boots. They may be a bit more expensive then you're looking for though.

Do you have any specific examples?

&gt; if they were actually able to rule on anything he did which a lot of the time they couldn't because the document just simply didn't cover for the 21st century

Again, specific examples?  Most of the articles are worded very broadly and the ECtHR has updated its interpretation of them over the years.  For example, look at Article 14:

&gt; The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this European Convention on Human Rights shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.

In the 1950s, the idea that gay and straight people, trans and cis people, and people with or without disabilities should expect to be treated equally would not have been taken very seriously, which is why these characteristics are not specified in the article.  However, the broad term ""other status"" provides an open-ended right for different groups to have their Convention rights applied equally, and ECtHR rulings have now repeatedly applied Article 14 to sexual orientation, gender identity, and disabilities.  There have also been numerous protocols added to the Convention over the years - ones from the 21st century include Protocol 13, which bans the death penalty in all circumstances, and Protocol 12, which broadens the application of Article 14 to cover national legal rights and the behaviour of public bodies (though the UK has so far refused to sign this one, because yay discrimination).

&gt; What I have to tell these bloack-heads every time is that judicial rulings/legislation is always better when its sovereign. 

It would be fantastic if every country in the world had a constitution guaranteeing everyone basic rights, and a strong independent judiciary to uphold it, but until we get there international pressure is going to remain an important method of securing human rights.

&gt; Let's take a basic example to show this. How toes the UK feel about banning the Burqa? Hm not to keen. How about you France? Hm pretty keen since that decision was based off their freakin' constitution. Well, this isn't going well. 

The French burqa ban was just an act of their parliament, it wasn't somehow required by their constitution.  Looking at the opinion polls, there seems to be stronger support for it in France than the UK, but there is still (embarrassingly IMO) strong majority support for banning the burqa here.  The ECtHR did consider whether the ban violated the Convention, and they held that it didn't - they could easily have gone the other way.",0,1412350253,null,0,false,0,ckzf2m3,t3_2hly1i,t1_ckzf2m3,t1_cku7t44,null,1426701657,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I didn't expect a title this season unless every player started playing 100% from the first game. People have generally forgot BRs bad spells and just created complete fiction after our great season. They forgot his bad choices at certain games that fucked us up completely, and like players, he won't get it right if media and fans turn against him.


His deflection which I see as the only major negative thing to have come out of the bad start might be justified after some fans reactions.


Let's not turn into /r/gunners, criticism is alright and should not be discouraged, but we shouldn't ask for anyones head and turn around in couple of months calling for new contract. 7 wins in 20 games his first season that everyone seem to have forgotten too, but then we got Coutinho and Sturridge and started improving. 


Well now we are getting Coutinho back in form, Sturridge returning and Lallana recovering well, just need Sterling not to burn out and couple of other players to step up and we will look great and these posts will look silly. Let's remember Sturridges ""great"" games when Suarez was out, he did get the goals but it was Bale like performances for Spurs, he gets the goal but we perform much better with Suarez.    
I think of Balos situation like that, he isn't great lone striker, our team/players aren't built around that, Mario is on top of that new to the team. When Sturridge returns he should be able to take turns on runs and positioning, just watch Sterlings new found ability to always make back post runs when in his early days he would stay wide.
