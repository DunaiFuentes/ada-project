true,kde01,king,,"&gt; I am just shocked at the optimism regarding him. I can't believe more people aren't arms in the air over the 30 MILLION POUNDS we paid for him. Mates are all Chelsea and they laugh and laugh at Lamela. I'm gutted but honestly, I can't defend him.

...they paid nearly twice that for Torres. TORRES. They're the last group that can laugh.

 
&gt; A guy like Lallana would've cost half of that and delivered twice as much. And mark my words, I still think Lamela may leave in the Summer. No way he was ""injured"" for that long.
&gt; 

You really think Lallana would have delivered on our side? Never. AVB would not have played him. Lallana is good, but he hasn't performed at the top level as well as Lamela. Lamela had two great years at the top level, Lallana is having his breakout year now. At 25. It's pretty safe to say he won't be getting too much better from here.

&gt; 
&gt; If Levy gets an offer close to what he paid, and he won't because the book is out, Lamela is gone.
&gt; 

No, i doubt that. I think you're being very, very pessimistic here. Lamela has been injured for the majority of the season. He'll come good next season. He's a superstar in the making, while Lallana is, at the moment, an overachiever. If you can't see that i don't know what to tell you.

&gt; 
&gt; We should def sign Lallana with that money.

I disagree. I think it'd be a good idea to sign him with whatever money we could get from selling Lennon, sure, but i don't think we should rid ourselves of Lamela, a great prospect we've already paid for, for someone who will not come cheap now that we don't own. 

I'm sure we'd be spending 20-25 for him if we went in for him now, and he's not worth that after one good season. The ceiling is just lower than Lamela, and Lamela was more impressive at Roma than Lallana has been at Southampton. 

Oh, but wait - Lamela isn't English. Right.

We have no right to complain about immigrants because we export more people than anyone else.

We have an incredibly promising youth setup that has performed well in past years and I think we need to focus on utilizing them and developing them.

Not to mention that if one voices their displeasure or disagreement, it seems like you're regarded as being 'racist' or that you're somehow small minded and bigoted.

true,jimicus,eng-somerset,"Where your aunt, your sister and your mum are the same person.","&gt; Is it really that much better than public schools, and if so, why isn't this pretty much the #1 priority on all political parties' radar?

By and large, yes. 

There's a lot of reasons, but broadly speaking it boils down to a few things:

 - Private schools (which for some reason may also be called ""public schools"" - the word you're looking for to refer to government-run schools is ""state schools"") can pick and choose who's admitted, so many disruptive pupils never get in in the first place.
 - More money-per-pupil generally translates into smaller class sizes and better equipment, buildings and facilities.
 - Some private schools push their pupils very hard. State schools normally finish classes at around 15:30 (give or take 15 minutes); I know of at least one private school that finished classes at 17:30 every day. Those extra two hours a day add up - over a two year period, the pupils had as much teacher contact as any other school would offer in three years. 
 - The whole ethos is different. The topic of conversation among people coming to the end of their school days isn't ""what are you going to do when you leave?"", it's ""which university are you going to?"". 

The only reason I can think of for it not being #1 on the political radar is it's not #1 on the general public's radar.  Probably because a **LOT** of people (including kids in private schools, figure that one out if you can) will never appreciate the vast gulf - either because they can't afford to or because they have an idealogical problem with private education.",0,1399498321,null,0,false,0,chc6hp1,t3_24xxah,t1_chc6hp1,t1_chbw90w,null,1433696248,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

&gt;*The trade bodies argue that the FTT would have “unprecedented extraterritorial impacts, contrary to G20 principles”. It adds that the plans will damage economic growth, increase the cost of financing for companies and governments, and create “harmful spillover effects on the global economy”.*

And:

&gt;But European leaders, with Francois Hollande from France to the fore, have made the FTT a key policy through which to make banks ""pay"" for the financial crisis and raise revenues too. Eleven EU countries, including Germany and Italy, have signed up to the FTT. EU officials have said they want the tax to apply across the single market.

&gt;The letter, dated April 16, argues the *“FTT would apply to transactions well beyond the 11 EU member states that have agreed to adopt it”* because it would be imposed to all transactions of a bank headquartered in the markets, regardless of its counterparty.
As it a result it contravenes the Communique made by the G20 just two months ago in which states pledged to *“monitor and minimize the negative spillover on other countries of policies implemented for domestic purposes”.*",0,1399499445,null,0,false,0,chc71bk,t3_24sb5g,t1_chc71bk,t1_chc6mtn,null,1433696497,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

And yes. The EU-wide FTT was blocked by the UK and others a while back. Which is why the 11 countries came to the EU to say ""we'd like to have a FTT anyway so (a) can you let us, and (b) can we use the EU framework to come up with a proposal and implement it?""

The Council Decision was saying ""yes"" to question (a). Which isn't anything to do with any specific proposal, hence the UK Government's case was never going to get anywhere.

The Commission then seems to have adopted the original EU-wide proposal to just the 11 countries as part of (b). The problem with it as is is that EU member states are obliged to help collect taxes for other Member States (which I think we can all agree is a good thing) and the UK Government is worried that this will apply to the new FTT, so the UK Government will have to expend resources to collect taxes due to e.g. Belgium. [At the same time, of course, Belgium has to help collect the taxes going to the UK under the UK's own FTT system]

And this is a problem as it means the 11-country-only idea will have extra-territorial effect, which the UK government doesn't like (or more likely, they don't care about the extra tax-collecting burden, they want to do anything they can to block the idea in principle).

* Spurs fans have been talking up how they're outsiders for the title or Champions League qualification for the last 15 years without much to back that up except for the two seasons they actually managed to finish 4th. They brag enough without any glory to speak of, god forbid how they'd be if they actually won something.
* The scum don't even need a proper comment.

Man City have bought their titles too, but the (long-standing) fans that I've come across have an air of humility from having had Man Utd over them for most of living memory. Their players seem alright, Pellegrini is a quality, upstanding manager, and the only thing that would piss off Utd fans as much as us winning the league is City winning it. Until you start going down the table to the likes of Sunderland winning the title it's a no-brainer for me if we're not going to win it.

true,redmanofdoom,null,null,"You don't understand how a subreddit like /r/soccer works, especially given the amount of people who use it (in the hundreds of thousands).

It goes like this:

Team A wins, supporters of Team A flock to /r/soccer to be happy/smug/arrogant and haters of Team A haven't got anything to laugh at them about and so crawl back into the wood work and post less, anything negative about Team A that they post is downvoted because of the current goodwill on the subreddit for Team A.

That is where we were 3 weeks ago, on our 11 game winning run, looking like we were going to win the league - do you think the Chelsea/Man U/Arsenal/City fans who hated us and didn't want us to win were posting much during that time? No, and if they were you probably wouldn't notice because they would be being heavily downvoted if they posted anything negative. That's how a circlejerk works.

The opposite is now happening for us. All the bitter cunts who dislike us whatever reason, whether that being Man U fans who just generally hate us (which I actually don't mind as much because we have a massive rivalry and the feeling is mutual) or other fans who hate us because we are 'smug' and 'insufferable' (which is about the most insufferable thing you can say, in my opinion) or other people who hate us because a small section of fans did some stupid things 30 years ago, are now coming out of the woodwork and back onto /r/soccer to release all the vitriol and bitterness they have been saving until the moment we fucked up. Of course, a lot of our supporters (including neutrals that wanted us to win the league, of which their seemed to be quite a few during our winning run) then don't bother posting on /r/soccer until things get cheery again and those that remain get drowned out by the new anti-Liverpool circlejerk to the point that it seems everyone hates us. 

That's what happens when you pair a fairly large community like /r/soccer and an incredibly tribal game like football.

&gt;The QE would be to bail out 

QE isn't really a bailout, but rather another form of macroeconomic manipulation. It has parallels to Greece where the Government stole bank savings from certain richer portions of its populace. The difference here is, QE effects every saver rather than just the better off. Imagine you saved £250k for your pension over 40 years, which you presumed would last 10 years. Overnight, it could only last you 2 years unless interest rates power on regardless (base rate and savings, very unlikely, others, quite possible). The one saving grace is unlike most our Administrations policies, QE disproportionately affects the old to the benefit of the young.

&gt;home-owners from their negative equity?

Not so specifically. The problem, is the fortunes of the electorate and very large sections of the economy are very closely tied to the housing market and the debt it services (mortgages linked to government bond rates). Not just through foreign direct investment, speculation, and downright greed, but also simple aspirational ownership which all form the demand base.

So when interest rates rise, it really hurts the ability of all types of owners to service their mortgages. Or in absolute ownership, to realise the liquid potential (increased interest means less demand means less resale value) in order to service other debts/investments. Interest rises for all sorts of reasons, including more people being unable to afford their repayments or less outside investment in our economy. 

This suddenly means people start being unable to pay debts, and people begin losing homes - which is doubly troublesome for banks. You would think at this point, great, that means people who are currently saving can afford to buy. But, while true, they may decide not too because they believe the value will tumble further still, and to buy now their new home value would plummet (and mortgage rates will still keep rising!). Suddenly you have affordable houses with unaffordable repayments. This is when any bubble truly pops - when demand is stifled by a lack of faith in stability/growth. Furthermore, at about this time significant savings holders may buy anyway seeing potential inflation and thus interest rises, in a misguided attempt to protect their Sterling against devaluation.

To prevent this disaster (or rather, correction), the Government would need to keep interest rates down and/or demand up (H2B barely registers). The best tool they have to do this, is to 'print' money (increasing supply, thus devaluing it). This means those who don't save, have a lot more purchasing power to spend when they receive new cash. All previous saved earnings become worth a lot less. However it does mean that credit should become easier to obtain as the Government's cost of borrowing is lowered which lowers fixed-term mortgage rates. This allows people to continue servicing their debt and keeps people in their homes (and others out of them).

Interestingly, when QE hits, is when foreign predators smell the most blood, and significant housing stock ends up in the hands of foreign investors, as suddenly their buying power increases immensely relative to the home population (see London). Without laws to prevent it, this leaves the home population vulnerable to being permanently priced out of the market even when the economy recovers.

The initial capital is also rather large and the areas that are great for wind farms are either out at sea or full of middle class NIMBY's who can't see the bigger picture because their hill might look a bit uglier. Theres also some studies that point to the idea that wind is *not* renewable and large scale extraction will lead to the depletion of the atmospheres energy and reduction in the amount of wind along with damage to the jet streams although the research is rather controversial.

Hmm, having typed that out I've changed my mind slightly, I think we should invest in wind/nuclear in combination, nuclear to handle the base load and wind for a lot of the other power and then as technology advances we can shift to better sources of power.

true,hiakuryu,cnty-england,London,"After the Daiichi Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant incident, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel under pressure from VERY recent Green party wins in Germany to begin the immediate cessation of use of 17 Nuclear Power Stations within Germany.

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/27/german-green-victory-fukushima

&gt;The Green vote was helped by the argument in Germany over its 17 nuclear power plants, heightened by the Fukushima disaster. In the aftermath, Merkel performed an 180-degree policy change by announcing the closure of seven stations built before 1980. She also said she was committed to speeding up total withdrawal from nuclear power.

&gt;This was six months after she had ignored public opinion by extending the life of the 17 plants by an average 12 years; in this, one of her most vociferous supporters was Baden-Württemberg's minister president, Stefan Mappus; he paid the price for his loyalty.

After that Germany had to start using Coal Fire power plants to meet it's energy needs. The Green party has suggested that we/they could be entirely on renewables. I find that highly implausible considering that Germany has a much better track record of Green/Renewable/Energy Efficiency than the UK.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19168574

&gt;As the country moves away from nuclear, the builders of coal-fired power stations are moving into action.

&gt;When Chancellor Merkel announced the closure of all the country's 17 nuclear reactors by 2022, there were loud cheers from environmentalists.

&gt;But less well heard were the cheers from the coal industry.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13592208

&gt;Before March's moratorium on the older power plants, Germany relied on nuclear power for 23% of its energy.

&gt;The anti-nuclear drive boosted Germany's Green party, which took control of the Christian Democrat stronghold of Baden-Wuerttemberg, in late March.

&gt;Shaun Burnie, nuclear adviser for environmental campaign group Greenpeace International, told the BBC World Service that Germany had already invested heavily in renewable energy.

&gt;""The various studies from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change show that renewables could deliver, basically, global electricity by 2050,"" he said.

&gt;PD302 On inspection, there is little or no threat of direct invasion of the UK by any nation. Commitment to a large standing army, a navy of large warships around our coastline, squadrons of fighter planes and a cripplingly expensive missile defence system is therefore unnecessary. Any threat of invasion that might arise in the future is so remote that realignment of the UK military and defence preparations would be possible long before any invasion occurred.

My problem with their defence policy is thus, they say we could effectively disband the military to almost nothing and then scale up is wishful thinking at beast and outright delusion in honesty. Weapon systems nowadays require a significant amount of investment not just in money but in time to be proficient with use. To also then pass this learning and skills on to new personnel is also something that will take time. In the event of a defence of the nation being required I don't see how that can be scaled up easily as they say in their policy. That's just the weapons, the skills required to train a soldier, a sailor, an airman or a marine takes months. What happens during that time? Well? How would it be handled? Well? A Royal Marine Commando enlisted takes 9 months to train whereas an officer takes 18 months from selection to graduation. What do we do in that intervening time period oh mister realistic polices? Well?

A modern international economy means multinationals working and the workforce generally accommodating some of the workplace cultural norms in addition to the company adjusting their cultural beliefs. 

&gt;EC401 The objective of EC402 is to shift the balance of economic power in favour of individuals and households, and away from large scale, remote private companies and central government. It will make full-time paid employment less necessary, and will encourage home-based and part-time employment, and work in the 'third sector'. 

So ok, they want to downscale big companies, private companies or government employees and make everyone a small businessman or volunteer? Are you honestly saying that is workable? I'll try to break it down for you. The small businessmen will get destroyed by predatory practices by big corporations or the green party will end up involving so many laws that the economy will fall apart.

It doesn't make sense to equivocate Subway making a business decision and the British government abandoning the values it's based on and becoming an Islamic theocracy. In fact the government is not even involved. When the government bans something that was legal because of Islam and then I'll protest it but until then it's just hyperbole. 

Also appeasement is not what's happening. Any muslim who says they should get special treatment by the government because of who they are can go fuck themselves. Any brit who thinks they deserve special treatment from the government because of who they are can equally go fuck themselves. The very reason people who scream about Islamification do so because the idea of equality with people who don't share their values is unacceptable to them and is a worse situation than British people being privileged over other people. They fail to see the equilibrium that you reach when you say everyone should be treated equally. What the BNP (for example) does when it declares that it's the government's job to decide what our values should be is allow any future government to decide what we're allowed to do or believe and what we're not allowed to do or believe. So no the government should not stop women from wearing the burka in public if they want to (provided they aren't being questioned by police or in a court room), no you shouldn't stop private companies or people from doing what they like or allow discrimination against muslims in any setting or any of that crap. Nor should you encourage the inverse. 

The thing about removing the government entirely from the debate on values and beliefs is that it makes this 'Islamic theocracy' worry of yours totally impossible. If the government can't force women to stop wearing burkas it can't force them to wear them either. If the government can't support the Christian faith it can't support the Muslim faith either. If it can't tell you to have British values it can't tell you to have Muslim values either. You reach an equilibrium where no-one is discriminated against, no-one is preferred and the idea of the 'Islamification' of the government or the state becomes an impossibility and your left alone to decide how you want to live and what values you want to have like a normal god damn adult human being with his/her own brain to make their own god damn decisions. I shouldn't be told that pornography corrupts our Christian values just in the same way as a woman shouldn't be told wearing a burka is wrong. Were all adults who hopefully are somewhere near intelligent enough to make up our own minds about our values provided we don't hurt people in the process. I don't want to be told to conform to Muslim values just as much as I don't want to be told to conform to British values. I can have my own because I'm an adult.

You may remember me from similar posts I made in [/r/NFL](http://imgur.com/a/oIqbn) and [/r/Baseball](http://imgur.com/a/4k2hx) toward the end/start of each league's season this year, or my future posts in the Premiere League Subreddits.  I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a [script](https://github.com/rhiever/reddit-analysis) made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. The actual word maps were made through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/advanced). As the /r/MUWs bot only does this in monthly increments, a little manipulation was required on my end to get the yearly breakdown. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, etc. were removed. Numbers were also removed.

true,bluebottled,null,null,"&gt;You cite nothing to support your outlandish claim that the benefits I spoke about are sourced from NI taxation. Contrary to your statement, most material that I've read indicates that we're a burden when it comes to benefits, not in any way self-sufficient.

Why would I bother citing a source when you're so wrong you clearly haven't bothered to find out what you're talking about?

We're taxed directly by Westminster, and the Assembly is then given a block grant which is a mixture of tax revenues and subsidies. In other words, everything the Assembly pays for is paid by tax revenues and subsidies ([45% and 55%, respectively](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/news/top-expert-warns-northern-ireland-economy-is-facing-meltdown-28779242.html)).

&gt;How is being in the UK preventing us from developing an economy exactly?

Because our economic situation is fundamentally different from Britain's. We're a developing country with a tax system for a developed country, and since we represent less than 3% of the UK population, the economic policies of Westminster are never going to favour NI.

Any time Westminster offers the Assembly tax-varying powers, they link it to a cut in the block grant, and no politician is going to take potential tax revenues over guaranteed subsidies (and opinion polls show people don't want them to). The only future NI has in the UK is one of unemployment, subsidies and reliance on the public sector.

&gt;The SLC, SSA and NHS are apart of the British establishment, created, maintained and paid for by the British Government. 

No they aren't. They're part of the government of NI. For example: we don't have the NHS, we have [HSC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_and_Social_Care_in_Northern_Ireland), maintained by the HSC Trusts in NI, and paid for by the Assembly. 

The other services you mentioned are also run and funded by institutions controlled by the Assembly, which is why Cameron's welfare cuts in Britain, tuition fee increases and privatisation of the NHS have not happened in NI.

&gt;What I was pointing out, was that elements of this establishment that don't offer any immediate benefit are often criticized by the same people that will happily use other elements of the same establishment.

And what I was pointing out is that opposition to the British army has nothing to do with the fact that they're part of 'the British establishment' and everything to do with the fact that they murdered dozens of innocents on our streets.

&gt;Furthermore, you're deviating from my main point, which was that this isn't about an individual nations military

Again you have no idea what you're talking about. The poppy appeal is run by the Royal British Legion and [proceeds from the sale of poppies goes entirely to members of the British armed forces](http://www.britishlegion.org.uk/about-us/what-we-do).

There's also few larger breweries like Greene King, who produce ""Real Ale"", but aren't that well regarded. People mostly lament how the beer's they make aren't as good as they were.

I get the impression American craft beers tend to be fairly to very hoppy, where as the British equivalent varies greatly. Our best seller is a malty beer with no obvious hoppy flavours. But we can also quickly sell a cask of [Arbor's](http://www.arborales.co.uk/) latest American style pale ale.

From http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/

&gt;AR100 The expansion and development of human society has inevitably affected the lives of many other species. Disruption to their lifestyles has been both accidental and deliberate and has resulted in suffering, death or even extinction. The prevailing assumption that animals can be used for any purpose that benefits humankind is not acceptable in a Green society.

&gt;AR415 Government research funds will be transferred from animal tests to non-animal technologies, including epidemiology, computer models, micro-dosing, imaging, DNA chips, microfluidics chips and the use of human tissue. Much greater use will be made of epidemiological evidence and clinical data. Greens would also fund more research into prevention of disease, looking at diet, environment, family history and lifestyle.

Yeeeeeeeeah, we can kiss goodbye to GSK et al.

&gt;CJ114 We will introduce the principle of ""restorative justice"", which while denouncing the crime, deals constructively with both the victim and the offender. The primary aim will be to restore and, if necessary, improve the position of the victim and the community; the offender will be required to make amends.

Shades of Terry Pratchett here...

&gt;“It was Carrot who'd suggested to the Patrician that hardened criminals should be given the chance to 'serve the community' by redecorating the homes of the elderly, lending a new terror to old age and, given Ankh-Morpork's crime rate, leading to at least one old lady having her front room wallpapered so many times in six months that now she could only get in sideways.” 

But moving on

&gt;EC401 The objective of EC402 is to shift the balance of economic power in favour of individuals and households, and away from large scale, remote private companies and central government. It will make full-time paid employment less necessary, and will encourage home-based and part-time employment, and work in the 'third sector'. People will be able to choose their own working lifestyles. The objective of EC403 is to enable people to meet their needs at the level most personal to them (the household sector being the smallest unit in any community) and to contribute more effectively through the informal economy to the wider community. A strong household sector, both informal and formal, will be resilient to fluctuations in the wider economy.

Empty platitudes and nonsense.

&gt;EN100 Energy is fundamental to life and to the economy. Energy is neither created nor destroyed, but flows from ""higher"" to ""lower"" forms irreversibly. All living things, including people, survive by exploiting this flow.

Noooo really? Can they make it sound more happy clappy crystal wavey bullshit? The whole energy policy reads like some kind of secondary school project.

&gt;MG100 The Green Party's long-term global vision is of an international economic order where the relationship between regions is non-exploitative, each region is as self-reliant and economically self- sufficient as practicable and the quality of life (social, political, environmental, cultural and economic) is such that there is less urge to migrate. Logically, in order to move away from the current level of immigration controls, we must create a fairer world.

kuuuuuuummmmm byyyyyy yaaaaaaaahhhhhhh

&gt;PD200 The citizens and communities within a green society will create for themselves rewarding work, adequate housing, material security, appropriate education, accessible and sensitive public services, a secure present and hope for the future, all within the framework of a sustainable, ecologically benign economy. The world we build for our children will not depend on exploitative economic relationships or on new roles for outdated security alliances, but on the acceptance of our global interdependence. The present environmental destruction threatens our common survival; we have no choice but to build common and co-operative responses.

&gt;PD300 The policies espoused in the rest of this PSS are all intended to build a culture of trust among peoples, as well as the primary goals they proclaim. In particular, International (IP) and European (EU) policy is intended to create a world where regions collaborate where necessary and interact peaceably.

&gt;PD301 We would promote town twinning, exchange visits, pen friend schemes and Internet-based methods for learning about other countries and cultures by direct contact. One of the main purposes of embassies would be to learn about culture and current affairs of their host countries by immersion in a wide variety of local activities. The UN should provide significant support for building effective law and order systems that are not affected by corruption, and for support of free and democratic elections.

JSA exists (as the name suggests) as a stop-gap between employment. Student loans pay for higher education. They can't really be compared. It's like saying, what's worse, paying for the office of fair trading or paying for the parole board.

In 2011/12 JSA cost £4.9 billion. On overall expenditure of almost £700 billion, that's tiny. Higher education expenditure was £13.5 billion plus £6.8 billion on HEFCE. Importantly, this isn't all paying for student loans.

To say ""what's worse?"" is meaningless. Student loans exist to support people going to university. More than half of current students (post-fee increase) are expected to pay back their full loans. In addition to this, higher education, in the main, results in higher incomes, therefore greater government revenue through income tax, NI, VAT and so on. JSA exists to support people in finding a new job.

I understand the whole ""well that's a mickey mouse degree, what's the point"" etc. But even if the person doesn't pay back their full amount, their overall deduction from income is likely to be more than it was had they not gone to university (because at least at some point in their careers I imagine most students earn over the income threshold). The benefits to higher education, while maybe not for every individual, are significant at a national level.

They both serve very different functions. Both of them being very important functions. I don't think it's possible to say ""what's worse?"". Worse in what way? What costs us more?

For example, say you reached your magic number of £500k with 3% WR, but only £150k was non-pension, you could retire at 45 taking £15k/yr income. This would come straight out of the non-pension capital because the pension compound interest and the remaining capital interest would build up the pension from £350k at 45 to £500k at 55.

Whoever we end up getting I'm confident we'll choose pretty well.

Eriksen, Vertonghen, Kaboul, Sandro, Lloris, Lamela... these are top drawer players!

Basically my point is though - above success (Mourinho, Ferguson etc) Spurs value attractive football, professionalism and class. LvG is not a fit for the club, I don't think.

true,LionoftheNorth,null,null,"How can a statement like that be *partially true*? Are we going to sign half a player?

I hope Paulinho has a good World Cup and that we can sell him for a very optimistic £25-30mil. I would also sell Rose to a bottom half PL side for something like £6mil. If there is no way we can get Vertonghen to play properly again, we should be able to get £25-30mil for him as well.

The money from Paulinho and Rose should go to a new LB and possibly a winger or two. Konoplyanka is listed at £15mil on [Transfermarkt](http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/en/evgen-konoplyanka/profil/spieler_58949.html?from=direktErgebnis), which would leave us with another £15-20mil to grab a great LB and we could use that money in an attempt to snag Ben Davies; Luke Shaw is very likely impossible. 

I desperately want Lamela to get into things, but Konoplyanka and Chadli as LW, with Townsend and Lennon as RW should be solid enough, especially if we can get a coach like De Boer who is used to working with young, talented players. 

The money we'd get from a potential Vertonghen-sale should go directly to CBs. To me, Caulker seems like an obvious buy either way, but the way Daws and Kaboul have been playing, we *need* a defender like last season's Vertonghen.

**tl;dr** Sell Paulinho and Rose for £30-35mil, spend the money on an LB and a winger.

Secondly, most likley we will finish 2nd this season with 100+ goals , were on track to win the thing after winning 11 in a row and being identified as one of the most formidable attacking teams in Europe. If Rodgers gets Manager of the Year, it will absolutely be a appropriate and just recognition for what he has achieved this year. 
 
However, we have had 50m of additions during the summer (how we used them is irrelevant), a striker who could was worth 30m more than that last summer and had finished 7th the season before with the same manager. 

Crystal Palace had 4 points after 11 games this season and averaged 0.3 points per game when Pulis came in and were 6 points from safety. In the last 24 games since then, 10 clean sheets, 21 goals, win percentage up from 17% to 47% with TP. Including taking points of Chelsea and Liverpool at crucial points in the season and looking like one of the most formidable teams in the premier league. All this while playing attractive football with a squad of Championship players and loanees. All this in 6 months instead of the 24 that BR has had to implement change (not to discredit BR at all). Manager of the year is about using what you have got rather than how high you finish on the table. And for me what TP has done in that 6 months is nothing short of astounding.

For me its a dead heat and as long as either BR or TP win it, thats fair enough. But hopefully this is a rational answer to why people might not agree that BR should get it.

I feel that i can afford a mortgage very easily, but if i save, i miss out on those life experiences. Im now in 2 minds as wether to even get a mortgage with all the talk of over inflated prices.
I guess thats the choice you have to make really, but the lack of help and support to get on the property ladder is a joke, and thats why so many people look towards renting and why so many landlords are buying up property after property, its pushes the value up and puts us out of the property market.

true,Chrisischan,flair8,,"It seems where we disagree is on Dembele and Paulinho as 8's vs Capoue as a 6, rather than on the quality of Bentaleb. Bentaleb does indeed have solid enough defensive stats, but he's also allowed some blinders to go and lost a few too many individual battles that I don't think Capoue would lose. I've mentioned several times yet that I'd like to see Paulinho sold, and while I absolutely rate the quality of Dembele in controlling the middle third, his hip injury has clearly worsened since the beginning of last season and I see no time in the near future where he will receive the needed rest to recuperate and hopefully return to his best. Nonetheless, not a single one of the players that have stepped into the No 8 position this season while playing with a three-man CM has sufficiently displayed the skillset needed to provide aggressive, incisive, and determined transitional play. Dembele used to, but his hip injury has worsened and he has always been averse to taking on the opposing back line as is. So for me, the No 8 position is where I think we could improve the most. 

Just out of curiosity, have you checked out tape of Capoue in France? And do you remember how he was in August? He was nothing short of superb back then, and as such is the standard I hold him to. His defensive contribution and level of clever forward passing was excellent. Bentaleb does not look forward enough for me while playing as the No 6, and IMO doesn't provide the physicality to compensate.

The other factor is that Capoue was the most vocally unhappy at Spurs.  That may change with Sherwood on the way out, but not until then.  And I disagree that Bentaleb has had all that many mistakes.  And those few mistakes he did make mean even less to me when it's taken into account that this was his first PL action ever.

It's all completely hypothetical.  Mousa's hip issue could never go away, Paulinho could completely fail to settle into England, and Capoue could turn into the next Yaya Toure.

Capoue was vocally unhappy with the situation under Sherwood. As we've seen today from Sandro expressing similar discontent, it's hard to blame them since Sherwood doesn't even believe in the position they play. If a manager were to come in that became interested in him and the assets he provides, I've no doubt he would change his tune. 

While Bentaleb's mistakes could certainly be chalked up to inexperience, it doesn't negate the argument that Capoue would be less likely to make those mistakes in those situations. We're talking about a brand new player to top flight football who has indeed often outshone more senior players playing next to him (hence the problem) in a horizontal midfield in which the two players do not have assigned roles, vs a guy who was the second highest rated player in Ligue 1 last season.

While it's fair for you to feel less inclined to place stock in Bentaleb's position during the Newcastle game, why should you then place any more stock in the games Paulinho did well in that we also coincidentally controlled? If we fairly evaluate these players on a basis of a middle ground between where they were each at their best and at their worst, Bentaleb looks a useful player with his versatility in a couple positions, while Paulinho unfortunately appears a bland and mediocre passenger who I have my doubts about being even able to contribute adequately with a new manager.

Coke is £65.99 for 12 liters of syrup. According to the website it either makes 96 liters (if you follow the 7:1 ratio) or 84 liters (if you follow what they've written) of coke. Taking the more optimistic value of 96L, that's 69p per liter.

Then you've got the cost of the gas - a cylinder can make 60 liters of drink, and a refill costs £7.99 from Argos (which seems to be a discount), or 13p per litre.

Not including water, total cost per liter of Coca-Cola would be 82p.

At full price in the new bottles, Coke is £1.06 a liter saving you 24p per liter. But something like Coke is on offer very regularly. At the moment Asda is doing 2 for £2.40, making it 69p per liter, giving you a 13p loss per litre. Sainsbury's, Tesco and Waitrose are all doing 2 for £2.50, still losing you 8p per liter.

I think that during the week we should have a ""Match Preview Thread"", in which we can discuss everything revolving around the next game - tactics, injuries, players form, etc.

This thread would be replaced by the Pre-Match Thread, which is fine to be posted 24hours before kick-off.

I don't think the sub gets ""flooded"" by posts about other teams, but there are quite a few throughout the week. I don't mind them, I may briefly look through them, and if they're not good, downvote them, which is what I recommend you do.

Perhaps a solution for that is a weekly stickied ""General Discussion"" thread, in which people can talk shit, post Andy Carroll is jesus pics, whatever they want.

I do like having match threads for rival's games though. Think those are really important and interesting.

Bottom line is, everything is on the front page for one reason: people want to see it. If you don't like the content, downvote, complain to the admins, ask the admins to make stricter rules, become an admin, or simply join another Liverpool forum.

&gt;[Birmingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham) has 571 parks totalling over 3,500 hectares (14 sq mi) of public open space,  more than any other European city.  The centrepieces of Birmingham's park system are the five Premier Parks. Ten parks have received the prestigious [Green Flag Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Flag_Award).  The city also has five [Local Nature Reserves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Nature_Reserve), one [National Nature Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Nature_Reserve) and a number of [Wildlife Trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_Trust) nature reserves.

&gt;One of Birmingham's most popular parks is [Cannon Hill Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannon_Hill_Park) which covers 250 acres (101 ha) consisting of formal, conservation, woodland and sports areas. Recreational activities at the park include boating, fishing, bowls, tennis, putting and picnic areas. The largest of the parks is [Sutton Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutton_Park) covering 2,400 acres (971 ha) making it the largest urban nature reserve in Europe.  [Birmingham Botanical Gardens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_Botanical_Gardens) are a Victorian creation, with a conservatory and bandstand, close to the city centre. The [Winterbourne Botanic Garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winterbourne_Botanic_Garden), maintained by the [University of Birmingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Birmingham), is also located close to the city centre.

I don't think this is a standardised method of testing economics policies - for it to become so we'd need loads of other economists performing similar calculations and reaching consensus.

As it stands another economist tomorrow could say ""ok, I'm going to do the same thing, but for *this long list of reasons* I disagree with Campos' assumption that makes a comparison with a hypothetical non-EU Britain which is 91% New Zealand and 9% Argentina"". If his calculations for a hypothetical non-EU Britain are instead a ""weighted blend"" of 20% Brazil and 80% Norway then he'd come up with totally different results.

It might just be that if 20 other economists all performed similar studies then they'd all come to the same conclusions as Campos, but at present it's unproven.

Using this in a political debate will never persuade anyone who's anti-EU, because you'll never be able to convince them of the methodology or that the difference is due solely to EU membership and not ""cultural differences"" (remember that many kippers think you can [discern someone's nationality by looking at them](http://i.imgur.com/i6ZYRRV.png) and that it's important that an Irishman is more ""culturally British"" than a brain surgeon from Syria or Pakistan).

Anything from Vince Cable, given the man actually has a sound grasp of economics and tends to favorite hybrid pratcalism, as opposed to the extremes of neo-keynsianism or montestism.

You'd have to be more specific beyond that. 

but the big difference here, he puts economics on the table, not empty platitudes like the green party. 

&gt;Sell off it is then. Might as well make some money out of the stuff we're not using.

Ok well, first off navy gets a lot of use, as does the RAF. Big problem there is and why this policy is just stupid, is we cannot just reverse it if we need to. As noted by Ukraine geo-politics can take massive swings in weeks, it takes 3-10 years to either put a ship with trained crew to sea, or a fighter squadron in the air. 

The army, which has the best turn around time for scability, has been hit heavily. Because the argument can be made we don't need a massive standing army at the moment. Cool.

But dismantling the Navy and airforce is idiotic. It's of proportionate size as is, is heavily involved monthly in anti-piracy (important for trade) operations and other alliance obligations. And we can't just cook a good one up if we get rid of it, then find ourselves needed it.

Not with Scientists it isn't, this is akin to saying ""global warming is controversial"", of any party the greens should know better given what we went through with global warming.

&gt;Intermintancy is still a problem but battery technology could change all that

Currently the best 'battery' the national grid uses is a mountain in Wales which pumps water off peak and then hydroelectrically generates at peak. We are a long long way off being able to have batteries with storage capacities large enough to be useful in the grid. Both articles you posted talk about car and electronic device sized batteries and as one says the annual improvement rate is only 6%.

There is also the issue of space, with an expanding population we need more and more land to build on. It would be nice to do this while still maintaining some natural environment in the countryside. Wind needs massive amounts more space to generate the same power as nuclear.

But I think for most people it isn't just the greens opposition to these things which they care about. Its the attitude which the opposition demonstrates, which is a party still rooted in its hippy roots making policy decisions based on whats 'natural' or what 'feels right' rather than a practical and pragmatic approach to facing the problems we face.  

Also moving away from those issues to me the rest of their manifesto reads like an idealistic wish list again rather than a list of practical suggestions or thought out strategy.

However, its possible to crowd out the wingers and nullify most of the attacking force of the formation, thus requiring EXCELLENT midfielders to help ease the pressure off with their runs into space.

the 4-2-3-1 is a solid formation, but I don't particularly like it as its a fairly rigid formation. You have 2 CM's and 3 AM's that are narrow, push them too wide, and the centre of the pitch gets wasted, as the CM's hardly push up that high. Thats where the No.10 is SO important, but if they get crowded out, the attack pretty much disolves against stubborn defenses as we should know.

The 4-2-3-1 is however, alot more solid defensively than a 4-3-3, as it allows the team to pressure from further up the pitch alot quicker than a 4-3-3. A 4-3-3 however, is less susceptible to counter attacks, because the fullbacks don't have to surge forward to provide width nearly as much.

[Take a look at paragraph three](http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/11/economist-explains-4).  We've benefited economically for being apart of the UK for many years.  When it comes to the EU alone, we trade with a population of 63 million.  That gets us a lot more than 2 million.

As far as those services not being apart of the British establishment, we're talking about a country that pays around 40% of its own weight, and that's arguable if we look further into the figures.  

The poppies themselves were first used by the Americans.  They were then [adopted](http://www.army.gov.au/Our-history/Traditions/The-Red-Poppy) by a range of nationalities, including the UK.

People have fought and died for the freedom we have today, do I agree with the conduct of the soldiers on that day? No. Do I think they should sully every soldier that the poppy represents? Definitely not.

To those saying that convertibles are pointless in the UK - not really.  As long as it's not raining then there's no reason you can't have the roof down.  Cars have heating, you can wear a coat, and it's quite fun driving along in frosty environments being able to see your own breath. :)

Running a car in the UK is very cheap compared to much of Europe. The only major issue is likely to be insurance costs to begin with, as you're not a UK national. 

If you go down the route of buying a car in the UK just get a 2.0 petrol Ford Mondeo or something - it will be cheap to run and you won't have any of the problems associated with modern diesel engines just for the sake of a few MPG.

In the past year  one lib dem councillor was arrested for planting CAR BOMBS, one was arrested for racially aggravated assault. Can you name anything a UKIP councillor has done that is remotely as criminal as this?

Repugnant as racism may be, there is a world of difference between saying ""lenny henry should go to a black country"", and actually planting explosive devices underneath automobiles.

The media and the political establishment don't want to debate UKIP on their points so they resort to accusations of racism. They want to perpetuate a narrative that UKIP are racist. 

Just the other day we had channel 4 talking about how a UKIP DONOR held racist views. Are ukip supposed to vet every single donor and trawl through their twitter and facebook history? This is simply unrealistic.

There exist extremists and crooks in every party and every walk of life. I don't buy your assertion that there is an especially large concentration of them in UKIP. 

Here is just a brief example of the various lunatics and extremists that have been found in other parties.

**Conservatives**

------------------------------

And believe me, this is just a very brief list of the crimes of other party members, which in my eyes are MUCH worse than posting racist and homophobic tweets.

Yet when a few bad eggs are found in UKIP, people like yourself claim that there is a ""concentration"" of them (despite only 10 people out of THOUSANDS being implicated), yet when members of other parties, often in more senior positions, are found to have done things as bad, if not worse.. it's just a few lunatics, and it says nothing about the party as a whole?

These are just dirty tactics that the press are engaged in here. A UKIP councillor makes racist comments on twitter and its front page news for weeks, a lib dem councillor gets caught planting car bombs and its barely in the news at all.

""The Ballad of Jim the Fish"" 

Anteria XVI Cordobane dig site. Day 65. This has been the most tedious excavation ever - I never thought it would end. 
But today - oh, today.
Jim would find this hilarious if he were here. There was this one time - 48th 
century I think, in a bar run by the Brotherhood of Maldovar - my sweetheart 
took Jim and me out for karaoke. I don’t remember much, it was all a blur - but I 
do remember “Islands in the Stream” and the video recorder. We lost the tape 
afterwards. Never even gave it a second’s thought, I don’t think.

Til today. We just unearthed a series of paintings on huge sandstone slabs. 
We’re not totally sure how they were formed - but that’s him - that’s Jim the 
Fish in that suit in that bar singing that song, gils flaring, teeth sparkling under 
the glitterball.

Each tablet seems to represent a different line in the song. There are symbols, 
and Sssibeth says he’s seen something like them before. He read the words 
“peace unknown”, “tender love”, “dedication”… We think these people built 
some sort of religion of love around the images. Oh, Jim!
I'm just grateful that the parts of the video featuring me don’t seem to be represented, but we're still digging!

Ok, I'll try to answer your questions:

Last week, Felipão went to Europe mainly to talk with Paulinho and our lads, he guaranteed their spots, and it shows that he has A LOT of confidence on them. I think Luiz will play every match, and maybe get benched if he receives a yellow and get in risk of being ineligible to a more important match.

L. Gustavo + Paulinho is an amazing DM pair, the problem is that Paulinho isn't performing that well recently. Felipão will probably test Paulinho in the group phase, and depending on his performance, Ramires will take his spot. If he manages to play like he played on the Confederations Cup, he will maintain his spot as a starter, benching Ramires.  
This is important: Paulinhos is a beast. It's a shame what Tottenham is doing to him.

Hulk is very underrated, and I honestly like him. Still, he definitely is not performing as good as the expected, and I think he will get benched. Willian has the spot here.

And this is why I don't like Daniel Alves. You see, when you grow up watching ROBERTO FUCKING CARLOS playing, or even Cafú, it's almost impossible to think that Daniel Alves is a great RB. I know Carlos was a LB, but still the comparison is valid.
Unfortunately, Maicon is not in a great shape and will probably stay in the bench.

Concerning Oscar: If he is not injured, he is one of the starters. It's beyond the shadow of a doubt.",0,1399541190,null,0,false,0,chclf77,t3_250gk0,t1_chclf77,t1_chckzpi,null,1433703477,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

I don't like Halal because it just adds another layer of suffering for the animal. When I can afford it I will buy free range but you will all have noticed that it is more expensive. Ever considered that going vegetarian and driving down revenue for farmers may be forcing them to opt for more intensive farming methods to make more money? Suddenly they're not making the £x a month they were before, so they need to sell more chickens on the land they have.

We need an alternative other than simply washing our hands of the issue and eating nuts and grains instead. Hence why I'll avoid or even boycott halal practices (although you may be called racist for doing so, even though it's just a stupid religious belief with no backing to it) for the stun method.

That doesn't happen though.

1. In addition to the direction-of-traffic lane (left) being blocked by a barrier on a level crossing as a train approaches, there is also a second gate, which closes 10 seconds after the first, to prevent people going onto the other lane (the right lane) to weave around the barriers. It closes 10 seconds later than the first gate to enable anyone who is already on the crossing when the first one comes down to get off the crossing.

2. Adding a button inside the corssing so that anyone who gets stuck inside (say if traffic was heavy and they didn't have a means to leave the crossing, having moved onto it in the first place as a result of being a plonker) can press the button, which opens the exit barriers only, and causes red lights all along the track to light up and alert the train driver to stop. This button therefore (a) allows a trapped car the opportunity to escape the level crossing and (b) means the train is stopped before it hits anything if the car cannot get off in time.

Of course, teaching people not to go on level crossings if the exit isn't clear or if the lights are flashing will help too. Seems not enough people got that memo.",0,1399542104,null,0,false,0,chcljzi,t3_24xuwm,t1_chcljzi,t1_chckuzh,null,1433703540,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,Paludosa2,null,null,"&gt; That doesn't happen though. More often than not, when a story breaks that a UKIP councillor or MEP is racist, homophobic, or generally bigoted, the first response from UKIP and UKIP supporters isn't 'what horrible views, I want them out of the party', it's 'another smear campaign by the media, just one bad apple'.

It does: Farage has apologised for getting it wrong, they've said they're improving their vetting procedure, they don't allow former-BNP, EDF members to join etc.

And yes, saying they are victims of a smear campaign is true: The stats back it up.

What it comes down to is 2 things:

1. New party that is the only relevant option for people who do have extreme views who then co-opt it for their own misguided platform.
2. Transitioning the immigration message from black-listed to acceptable debate and then progressing it on to global question of Migration Policy. Atm the rhetoric is attention-seeking but also attractive to extremists. If the message evolves more into stats and policy it will improve and won't draw extremists because the debate is open it means their message is redundant.

&gt;*Seeing that we live in a democratic country, and people have always had the option to vote for UKIP or another anti-EU party*

You're forgetting the status quo effect of ""Vote A or B else a wasted vote."" Secondly people DID vote for a party that promised &lt;99,999 limit (Tories) who are UNABLE to deliver on that mandate due to the EU.

true,rockstarsheep,eng-Oxfordshire,London,"Interesting points. I'm an avid reader of Private Eye. It gives me a great deal of insight to the shenanigans that happen here and elsewhere. I'm in no doubt that corruption is worldwide. My measure of corruption doesn't necessarily start at the highest levels of power or government, with big ticket bribes or abuse of power. They may make for juicy headlines, but more than often don't go anywhere. Even with what happens here, there's still a sense of fair play. With enough public pressure, a Cabinet minster will resign or serve some time or pay a fine. In Africa, which is my only source of firsthand knowledge, you can be accused of multiple rapes, even go to trial, and laugh it off with impunity. 

You can drive drunk, kill someone and then threaten the police to retract and then lose evidence. Expenses fraud? No, no my friend, that's just Expenses. Those helicopter trips, to and from work, say, 20 miles away. All good. Shopping trips with taxpayers money? Surely they want me to look good? £30,000 for a Facebook page that's got 10 posts on it and nobody knows about. All gravy. Or, how about. Let's buy the public transportation system of a city, run it in to the ground, sell it back to the city for a profit and then buy it back and up the price, 18 months later - and then declare bankruptcy.  And then you have the poseurs to deal with. The so called ""educated,"" who talk a good talk, but don't do much else. It's heartbreaking and infuriating to see children running around garbage tips, flies at their mouths, scrapping for broken toys in amongst the garbage, knowing that the taxes that should be going to helping them are just lining pockets. My man, there are the extremes, and I can absolutely understand that it takes time to address problems inherited from the past. The thing is, they need to be addressed, instead of ignored. 

What truly blew my mind, was that several years ago, when I was working for an African run firm - they joked that I was the ""token white guy"" - which was kind of funny at the time, a colleague and I brought a proposal to use technology to enable entrepreneurs to sell and deliver goods in to remote areas, that because it was not a big money spinner, our MD wouldn't fund it. Even though it would pay for itself. His attitude and many others we talked to was that it wasn't in their interests to help alleviate poverty. Hard to get your head around. Maybe we didn't try hard enough. Obviously, these are small scale stories. They seem too common though.

It may indeed seem harsh to suggest that things need to get worse, before they get better. History shows us, time and again, that until people well and truly get the hump, they'll tolerate all sorts of nonsense. It took a while for Magna Carta. It took a while for Parliament to wrest power from the king. And so on and so forth. Something similar may need to happen elsewhere. 

Why I say books, is that not everyone has access to a steady supply of electricity, so reading at night may only be via candle light. You can't charge an ereader without juice. And added to this, books are pretty tough pieces of kit. Not that I'm against ereaders. It's their practicality that might be tricky for the environment. 

This all being said, I know some remarkable people who're doing their utmost best to pay their way through higher education to become professionals, in Africa, doing it under duress or threats of violence. The triumph of the spirit you might say. They're investing in their future by hard work now. :)",0,1399542933,null,0,false,0,chclodn,t3_24xpvb,t1_chclodn,t1_chck5bi,null,1433703598,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,NEWSBOT3,null,null,"Depends where you live of course, there are leafy suburbs and not-so-leafy suburbs. Most of the major villages surrounding it (and to an extent the town itself) suffers from the collapse of the coal mining industry in the 80s and have never really recovered. Unemployment is fairly high as a result and has been for decades, and there's a lack of money for infrastructure and other things as a result. Its used as a commuter town by a lot of people because it has good rail links (and fairly good motorway links as well) to other cities. Most people i know that live there work in sheffield or leeds since those tend to have better job markets. I've seen several folks that commute to london and live there because they can have a 3 bed house for 100k. House and rental prices are pretty cheap, there are some places with 2 bed terraces for 60k etc. 


The town centre itself is largely run down and slowly dying, despite the frenchgate getting refurbished a few years ago. it used to have a fairly active market but the traders have been dwindling for years. There's still some market stalls for meats, fish, cheese, veg etc but they are getting smalelr. Many of the old town centre shops have become pubs because thats the only demand that was around, so the town centre has a very drinking heavy culture at weekends (although this has declined and is generally only busy close to payday weekends now)


There's a few out of town shopping options for various things, i dont really find any of them that great but they make up for the town centres dwindling uses. 


crime varies , its not that high crime generally, but its not that low either. I've had my car broken into there because i left valuables visible etc there (which was my own fault, but still), and im generally pretty careful not to leave any obvious opportunities like that whenever i visit. Some areas are better than others of course, and the outlying villages tend to improve the smaller they are. 


Public transport is ok - there's a bus network that covers most major roads and a few places also have local train services. The buses are fairly expensive for the distance covered. Taxis are fairly cheap.

The union is disproportionately popular among the political classes compared to the public, which means the integration into the EU has been undertaken without a democratic mandate.

I read the article you posted and I read the summary of the radio program, thats where my 6% figure came from,

&gt;We'll ask whether Lithium-Air batteries can revitalise the electric car market, explore whether flexible graphene batteries and solar cells hold the key to enhancements in mobile phone battery life and look at the 3D printing of micro batteries the size of a grain of sand.

However from that summary I didn't see the point in listening as I am already pretty up to date on battery tech and clearly they were talking consumer products not infrastructure solutions, as I said in my reply.

&gt; Safety of eating GM food may not be controversial but its economic and political impacts are still very controversial

The old I'm not against GM because I'm anti science its because I hate Monsanto argument. Well I'm sorry but the way round that problem is legislation as to the commercial use of GM, not a ban on research and development.

&gt; ""no evidence that you get long term increase in yield with GM over time"" for example

GM isn't all about yields, some of the benefits from wiki:

- Improved shelf life

- Improved nutrition

- Stress resistance

- Herbicide resistance

- Pathogen resistance

- Production of biofuels

- Production of useful by-products (Drugs)

They now account for 10% of all crops planted worldwide, farmers are stereotypically hard nosed bastards and GM crops are expensive, they wouldn't be doing it if there were no benefits.

&gt;""battery packs in the loft could charge up when the sun shines and the wind blows, and then supply heat, light and boiling water on winter evenings.""

What happens when those things don't happen? I used to work on boats which make extensive use of batteries for almost all functions. Even with a very large (expensive) bank of batteries and the most minimal use (running 4 LED lights, 5 low power small instrument displays and a GPS) you would be lucky to see 24hrs out of it and thats with being charged though an inverter off a diesel engine. You still need a national grid or energy storage on a massive scale for when your distributed power source fails to provide, unless people are willing to put up with severely limiting their energy consumption when called for.

Nice use of pejorative language there. It isn't that they are ""stealing"" jobs.

The simple fact is that 7 guys who come from Poland who end up sharing a small house and pooling bills, can work for a much lower wage than a native Brit who lives with their partner and has a child. 

That is why we've seen wage compression. It is a direct result of mass immigration. That's not ""hatred"" as you put it.

PSG got their €200m/year deal adjusted down to fair value of €100m(!) still huge. Anyway I thought we failed the same part but due to our much publicised decision to sell the image rights (still not confirmed) and the IP revenue of £22m.

Worth pointing out this was not money paid to us by NYCFC or Melbourne Heart, as devineman told me the other day ""City charged City Football Services and City Marketing Services money who are both part of the City Football Group umbrella."" And as far as I can see he is right.

AFAIK, that is the main sticking point - whether the £22m was ""fair value"" and we actually supplied something for that money, or whether it was just paid to pass the FFP with no benefit.

I believed that was the problem - we think we provided fair value, UEFA don't - what is ""fair value"" anyway? Its pretty subjective so I can imagine that being the clubs sticking point and reason why they are prepared to take it to the next panel and then CAS.

Also regarding the sanctions of 21 players, people are under the impression we have to have 8 HG players, and thats not quite true. You cant have more than 17 foreign players normally (13 for us under sanctions). And u21 players (Rekik, Nastasic, Huws, Lopes) don't count anyway. Also clichy is HG which people have forgotten.


P.S. - Just seen PSG got all of their sanctions removed, an fine cut to €20m- and they missed by much more than us! Not sure what that means.

Sky Sports 1 to begin Draft coverage at 10pm this Thursday
 
The 2014 season starts here! With the NFL Draft come dreams of seeing your team's fortunes transformed by a hot first-rounder or fears that an arch rival has been bolstered by making a clever trade.

You can watch the drama of the first round unfold this Thursday night (May 8) when Sky Sports 1 airs the action from New York's Radio City Music Hall, going on air at 12 midnight, with the first pick at 1 a.m.

Joining Kevin Cadle and Neil Reynolds in the Sky studio will be former Dallas Cowboys, Denver Broncos and Buffalo Bills head coach Wade Phillips, a man who has learned a thing or two about NFL drafts during a 45-year coaching career.

Setting the scene for the draft, Sky Sports 1 will air a special Masterclass with Andrew Luck at 10 p.m. before taking a look at last year's draft with the Hey Rookie documentary at 11 p.m.

Meanwhile, all three days of the draft – including rounds two and three on Friday and four to seven on Saturday – will be streamed live on nfl.com.",0,1399547088,null,0,false,0,chcmclr,t3_2513te,t1_chcmclr,t3_2513te,null,1433703914,2,false,NFLUK,t5_2yr0f,2

Although I was at a lowly-ranked comp. so I was lucky to be able to do Further Maths at all - fortunately the Further Maths Network offered it.

I think compulsory maths education is a nice idea, but I don't know how well it'd work in practice as many people really don't like maths. And you could just end up with lots of disinterested people gaining very little from it and potentially worsening the education of others.

I think as far as STEM goes we have to show people _why_ it is awesome - like that quote:

And if after I get my PhD I can't get employment in one of the really cool fields I still have loads of transferable mathematics and programming experience. So hopefully I wouldn't end up in Starbucks.

I just think that many kids have a very narrow and dim view of STEM subjects as just being dull and boring, and seem to imagine that studying Media etc. will be the ticket to a life of stardom.

There's no way someone can keep doing it without a break, and there is never a break.  You can just ignore your students and let the teaching suffer, but most of the staff partly went into the field because they care about teaching as well as the research.  
 
Every semester you have to mark hundreds of essays, which can take an hour EACH.  On top of this you have to sift through 100s of daily emails.  Important ones, not just fluff, but ones from students needing urgent help, or from colleagues or your boss asking for things.  Then you have to prepare exams which takes a long time because of submitting it to the school for approval etc.  Then you have to spend a LONG time manually entering marks into the database which is pointless busywork that doctors shouldn't have to be doing.  Then you have to do extra lectures because others are ill.  You have to stay late every single night some months because you are required to have open office hours for your students.  You have to spend a long time every year rewriting the student handbooks for each module, even if it''s essentially the same as last years.  You have to spend a long time following the current research and making sure your material is up to date.  
 
This is more than a full time job as it is, and then you are expected to do research on top of that, and then face horribly short and impossible deadlines?
 
I also love how your argument in the face of evidence that mental illness is an issue in academia is that ""well it can't exist because other jobs are hard too"".  Maybe start looking at the reasons for it, give lecturers the benefit of the doubt, and not just immediately deny it outright cos it doesn't fit in with your world view.  These are humans who are becoming ill, and the choices are either to do an easy career instead, compromise the quality of the students' education, or become mentally ill.  I say again, humans are becoming mentally ill, and it seems like you are saying ""tough shit, roll up your sleeves and deal with it"", which is an issue the mentally ill have had to face since the beginning of time and is a stigma that really should not still exist in 2014.

Thus the judge can only sentence for the action - the punch and not the consequences - the death, because the offender didn't actually want to kill the victim. The death was just bad luck.

With regards to the drunk driving, if a hypothetical person kills someone whilst driving under the influence of anything (drink, illegal drugs, legal drugs purely for recreation, or even prescription medication that forbids them to drive) then that person can not only be charged with driving under the influence, but they can also be charged with death by dangerous driving, whereas the person caught after weaving in the road or crashing into a hedge or something only has one charge - DUI.

Now the first defendant has two charges against them, that they can be found on separately or plead to separately. The second only has the one, which is a much easier battle for them to fight if they so choose. 

So in a typical case the driver who didn't kill anyone would likely get a driving ban depending on the level of intoxication, a fine, and points on their license, whereas the driver who killed someone would likely get a custodial sentence, plus a larger fine and a longer ban and more points on the license.

If you support **uncontrolled mass-immigration** from countries with a high prevalence of child brides, honour killings, or forced marriages - then yes, you are partly responsible for the increase of those crimes in the UK.

At no point did I claim that the UK is free of pedophiles or child molesters. However we do have laws against it. Compare that to countries like Yemen, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia etc, where child brides are common place and an accepted part of the culture.

[Just last month a bill went before the Iraqi parliament that called for the return of child brides and child marriage.](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/20/iraq-child-marriage-bill-human-rights). Would such a thing happen in the UK? We both know the answer to that.

I should also mention that the tories are partly to blame as they are speeding up the process of this happening.

1. There is a system with the dual barriers you suggest on some main running lines, but to fit it to every line would either be impractical or impossibly expensive. Besides, such a system wouldn't have worked at this crossing because the crossing looks like it is only 1 lane wide and has no barriers at all. 
1. This is impractical on the lines that do use these barrier types because these are normally used on main running lines where the trains are likely to be moving significantly faster. Trains are not capable of stopping from 30mph within the time it would take for a person to realise they are stuck, think about what to do, get out, and push the button, and besides a lot of the crossings are not closed until after the train has passed the closest signal to the crossing.

Yes I agree but am very doubtful legislation of such powerful companies works. Legislation of the financial industry and legislation of the fossil fuel industry has not worked.

Stress resistance
Herbicide resistance
Pathogen resistance

These are about increasing yields... which is not proven and from the program there was concerns that weeds have developed resistance to the herbicides. 

Improved shelf life
Improved nutrition

Have these been objectively proved and peer-reviewed? I Highly doubt it.

The point with battery technology is that now with electric cars and lots of electronic devices + renewable energy storage there is billions of dollars to be made in increasing battery efficiency, the incentives are massive for R&amp;D, a few years ago the incentives were not as large, it is very likely there will be a breakthrough. Tesla should be decreasing the costs of their batteries by 30% this is already a big step. The future looks much brighter than it did, so why spend crazy money on nuclear that will take 20 years to come online? 

Another study suggest we can be 100% renewable (mostly solar and wind with current levels of technology) in 2030.      http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/sad1109Jaco5p.indd.pdf

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;His party is full of racists and nationalists

0.3% of candidates have been caught out for having extremist views and instantly expelled from the party so there is no factual data that suggests the party is full of racists. Compare this figure with 0.6% of last term MPs who have been given jail time. You also have to consider the many ethnic members who have come forward recently to try and dispel this myth and the fact that UKIP are the only party who ban any members from extreme organisations from joining in the first place (this includes the BNP). Also you are confusing patriotism with nationalism. There is nothing wrong with having a bit of local pride. Farage calls his parties stance ""patriotism with a small p"".

&gt;Today we owe a tremendous amount of our culture to globalisation and foreigners and we owe a debt of gratitude to the world at large.

UKIP are not against globalisation or immigration. In fact their immigration policy is the fairest out of any party.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The point you overlook is that there is a lot of waste in the public sector. 

Here's an example from when I was in the army as a vehicle mechanic at the military school of driving. We had a lorry which was taken off the road (VOR) because it had a faulty hazard warning light switch. There were none in the stores. There was a dealership THREE MILES AWAY but because of the procurement process, we couldn't use them. That lorry was off the road for 9 months because of a switch. In that time the lorry was serviced every few months as normal even though it hadn't gone anywhere. So you had a lorry costing money to sit there unused, the army having to pay for an additional vehicle to cover that one which was out of service and all to save a few pence on the price of a switch - spending pounds to save a penny. This goes on so much in the public sector it is beyond a joke.

If this was the private sector doing this they'd have gone to the main dealer, bought the switch and the truck would've been back on the road the same day. No ""dead servicing costs"" and no need to spend money having an additional truck to cover the months if it being out of service.

There are many many other examples. I have a business selling ex-corporate and ex-government laptops. For several months in 2010, every 2 weeks at the IT auctions I sourced them from there was ex-govt Thinkpad X200s's for sale which were THREE MONTHS OLD. I couldn't believe it when I did a warranty lookup on the serial numbers. There were piles of them. These were laptops which were over £1200 new and three months after they were bought by whatever government department had bough them they were being sold. I was buying them for £250 each so the government were losing over £1000 on each one. 

I'm sure you can find examples of waste in the private sector, I have some tales of that of my own, however the difference is that that waste costs the business, not the taxpayers.

true,pharao007,null,null,"And this is a point you see it from. I can tell you different point and prove me otherwise and I mean prove it in either direction.

Certain jobs can't have easily increased wages, especially in a matter of not few percent but even twice what they currently are. Like increasing NMW from 6.31 to 12. You may say it's employers who make money out of it but can you prove it, especially with every single employer? How about wages differences? If wages for low paid jobs go twice, how would middle paid jobs and high paid jobs react? Stay on the same level or increase as well.... making a whole rise only on paper, as goods and increase will have to follow.

Also, do we have any actual proofs that because there is unemployment within a local population they do enough to find that employment? Aren't there any people who simply will NOT work, or won't work hard enough, or by at least twice the wages? Not saying about generous benefits system?

Another important point. Eastern Europeans' population increased UK's population by 1%. How they can be responsible for reducing wages by 14%? I'm not economist but that just seems like something that is simply not possible.

How about other immigration groups? Isn't it actually the illegal immigrants, who lower the wages as because they don't have rights to work here, they will often work below NMW as they can't even officially complain. EU citizens, some of them may also work below NMW but since they have full rights what do you think, that many of them will work like that? Knowing they can sue employer and get money out of it?

Why do you think that sharing a house is something wrong in principle? It's an often thing to do and is done by people around the world AND even local population? However, do we actually have any figures of what percentage of those migrants share houses and whether it's in 7 or 2 living there? How many non-EU migrants also ""share"" houses, by simply living in large families together? Isn't it relevant?

So, yeah, if a person wants to make a case using your arguments it would be great if they could look at both sides of everything, not blame all on immigrants.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt; petty bourgeoisie

It's a misworking of the French of course, but considered equally correct in English today because the error has been established for so long.

I obviously don't know your circumstances, so I was just pulling your leg really, but generally most of those who consider themselves capitalists don't get sufficient returns on the capital they own to really merit the term.  They're either just small business owners who have to do actual labour at their firm and and maybe draw enough from it to support themselves and maybe an immediate family, or, even more far removed, they're someone who has a pension or a few grands' worth of shares which don't even pay sufficient income for an annual long weekend away.  Maybe they dream that one day they'll be capitalists, or imagine themselves to be so, but, at most, they're petty bourgeoisie and many/most of them are really workers who provide the useful idiot fanbase for capitalism (and end up supporting fascism when it all goes horribly wrong).

&gt;You can be a capitalist and still have ethics.

I certainly don't think all business owners are bad.  I've done it myself several times - although almost invariably socialist-organised businesses (I've subcontracted work a couple of times in ways which made me uncomfortable so I can't say always).  

And there are definitely bosses and bosses, even in the capitalist world, although I think the good guys definitely begin to thin out as you go further up the greasy pole.  I think they're wrong to set up their businesses as they do, and I think Wilde is right that the good slave owner can cause more harm than the bad by masking the total repugnance of the system with which he's involved, but ultimately only future generations will be able to look back at what was done in the name of capitalism and to decide if it was worth the price - always assuming humanity as a whole survives it.",0,1399553528,null,0,false,0,chcnu36,t3_24y2j2,t1_chcnu36,t1_chcn43j,null,1433704614,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Ok cool, so we'll just ban the incredibly promising new technology, glad we've got that sorted.

&gt;Have these been objectively proved and peer-reviewed? I Highly doubt it.

Why not check? Or better yet ask yourself why would 10% of the worlds crops be GM if there were no benefits? Are the people planting them doing it for fun? Do you think they were convinced to part from traditional methods and pay more money for seeds by promises and fairy dust? Or maybe, just maybe the evidence does exist and they were shown it.

&gt;The point with battery technology is that now with electric cars and lots of electronic devices + renewable energy storage there is billions of dollars to be made in increasing battery efficiency, 

You are still on a completely different page here, it is non trivial to convert consumer battery tech to industrial scale, very non trivial. Yeah in the future you might get 2 days battery life out of your smart phone or your tesla might do 200miles range but those devices still need plugging into something and I highly doubt the national grid will be able to run off stored power for more than 0.1sec.

&gt;Another study suggest we can be 100% renewable (mostly solar and wind with current levels of technology) in 2030.

That article is a blue sky thinking article, there is no practical way of implementing that plan unless countries shift to a war style economy based purely around producing the required equipment, they even allude to that themselves.

On top of that again as they say you shift the load from one dwindling resource (Fossil fuels) to another (Rare Earth Metals)

&gt;More problematic is the claim by 
Meridian International Research that not enough 
economically recoverable lithium exists to build 
anywhere near the number of batteries needed in 
a global electric-vehicle economy.

Another issue completely ignored by the article is space, 1 nuclear power stations needs [1,200 square kilometres](http://theenergycollective.com/robertwilson190/200741/nuclear-vs-wind-energy-UK) of wind turbines to replace it. We also have a growing population which will presumably need more land to live on and feed itself. They want to build,

&gt;The authors’ plan calls 
for 3.8 million large wind 
turbines, 90,000 solar 
plants, and numerous 
geothermal, tidal and 
rooftop photovoltaic 
installations worldwide

That doesn't sound too feasible to me.

&gt;The post was mainly for people who think Nuclear is cheaper than wind and solar (which is not the case), and those who think GM is a silver bullet

But you're original post didn't say/explain either of those things, you framed it as a debate about why people don't support the Greens. If you want to debate those things go to the relevant subreddits where there will be more informed people who are up for debating them.

Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland, and most of the developed world that isn't America doesn't have a totally nationalised system, and your granddad would not have been left to die in any of these countries. 

This thread has been live about an hour, and we already have the scaremongering that anything that is run by a private company won't be free at the point of use. The NHS can't even contemplate charging people for crutches because no one returns it, and you chumps think somehow because a private company replaced your hip we're going to be like America in a couple of years. Use BASIC LOGIC please. 

Compromising the ridiculous system where everything needs to be centrally run and organised in a huge beurocratic mess, where the right hand doesn't know what the left is doing, will not mean you have to start paying for your healthcare. The NHS is such a mess that within the same hospital you will find things like each department using different canulas and rubber gloves, so they don't even get the economies of scale you'd expect.

As someone who has been into hospitals quite a bit, let me tell you the system is disgustingly bad at times.

I have been on wards where senile patients are just screaming all night long. This wasn't a money thing, this was a disgusting culture of neglect.

It's hard to compare but the World Health Organisation in 2000 ranked the UK 18th. Well behind Italy, France and Spain. 


Have an acute problem? Broken leg? Cancer? No worries, NHS will fix you up. Anything else, come back when your symptoms are more acute or join a waiting list. Want to see a GP? 1 week for the next appointment. No services on the weekend. A&amp;E? Yes sir please have a seat over there for 3 hours.


The worst thing you can do is read anecdotal evidence and blindly think the NHS is the best health care service is the World. Of course it's better than America, everyone's is!


And it's NOT free. Your tax dollars pay for it! Your tax dollars go towards massive inefficiencies in the NHS like patient records all being in paper files and your GP still communicates with your specialist through the bloody post! Your tax dollars go towards short term contract staff/consultants being paid £1,000 a day because NHS Trusts can't get their act together.

As a nation our worst trait is to critisise the things that we do well.  The NHS is the best health service in the world, fact, in the same way that the BBC is the best broadcaster in the world despite the fact we are never all going to like 100% of it's output, however we just love to moan and complain about them.  

If people want to pay £50 to see any GP at any time (who does not keep full records because there is no real health service to centralise a system where anyone can see any GP at any time ) then be charged £150 to see a specialist or £50 for blood tests or £2500 to give birth then they should try living in Ireland. (as I have on and off for 15 years, healthcare there is a joke).

The care and support can vary wildly in the NHS, as I saw with a relative last year, after a fall she was treated quite badly by the assesment ward at the local hospital, however it was a saturday night and they were very busy and after a couple of hours she was on a dedicated orthopedic ward where the staff were fantastic.

The monarchy have virtually no political power, and they haven't for a long time. I believe that the average taxpayer only pays under one US dollar of tax per year towards them, so they're not exactly a big strain on our economy either (if anything, there's always a belief that they're good for tourism). They're also some kind of official mascots, not just to decorate money and stamps with, but to be sent around the world to wave at crowds and sit through tribal dances. I think this is meant to have some kind of benefit for international affairs. Possibly. Point is, it's a very superficial role. No one 'lives under' a monarchy, or even if we technically do, it never feels like it. 

Most people just aren't bothered. A few years ago, when the Queen's birthday/Jubilee/whatever was a national holiday, I remember walking past a group of anti-monarchy protesters. There were about 5-10 of them standing outside the local Civic Centre. It just seemed a waste of a day off when they could be in the pub like everyone else (no street parties and flag waving to be seen either). 

Public opinion will tend to drift back and forth over the royal family every decade or so - not so much the idea of having them, more whether they're likeable or not. At the moment, they're a good supply of happy stories for the media - who wants to talk about miserable old Syria AGAIN when there's something nice like a wedding or a baby? Kate wears a nice dress, that's the Telegraph's front page sorted. Particularly around big events, the general public gets sick of the overkill, but we'll put up with anything in hope of another day off. During the bad years, they're guarenteed to provide juicy gossip, again for the media. Jokes about Prince Harry's Nazi costume can still be heard on panel shows, and this isn't even starting on people thinking they're edgy for telling a joke about Diana's accident that's almost as old as they are. 

So that's what it's like having a royal family. Tax funded celebrities. They're on the news more often then you'd like, but otherwise they're just there in the background. Some love them, some hate them, most don't care but might make the odd comment about a particularly big story. 'They're there for the tourists' is the most popular opinion.

But still, it puts all other print journalism to shame. I can't deny that there is much greater levels of groundlevel corruption in developing countries, but in many cases they are trivial compared to what the big guys in every country get up to. 

Having read private eye, you will know that there are whole slabs of the establishment who very rarely face justice. Sometimes, yes, but broadly no. Fiddle your ""expenses"" and flip your house making a couple of hundred thousand and profit and you don't even have to pay it back, fuck up your benefits claim and go to jail. 

I found your list of examples interesting as there are multiple examples from the UK. Shopping trips can be equated to the expenses scandal; expensive trips to and from work - not quite the same level but first class rail tickets as one example and cameron cycling to work followed by a car is another; the corruption in the edinburgh tram system has been covered in depth by private eye; there are numerous example of councils paying exhorbitant sums for basic websites - birmingham being a big one; 

Capitalism, if there is no profit in doing something it will not be done. That's a rule which applies very well across the world. Unless someone can make some money nobody cares.

Second half starts off great, Stewart Downing equalizer for West Ham. Then Liverpool come out firing. Sturridge and two Suarez goals, 4-2. Chelsea are winning by lots at this point but it doesn't matter.

Suddenly Newcastle break on the counter. Oh fuck, 4-3, what the fuck was the defense thinking, we're going to throw this away again. But right before the end, an unlikely hero in Joe Cole flicks it onto the head of Andy Carroll a minute before stoppage time. 2-1 West Ham. Liverpool are in the lead, but it's not over yet, stoppage time!

The full time whistle blows in Manchester. It's all over there, City have lost! But Liverpool are being attacked by Newcastle. Mignolet's just saved 3 decent Newcastle shots, and Skrtel escapes a red card, just, for a bad tackle. And then our hearts sink. The referee has given a penalty to Newcastle, in a ridiculous decision, as Daniel Agger was nowhere near him. BUT MIGNOLET SAVES IT! He grabs the ball, sees Suarez up field, boots it long. Suarez has a moment of absolute brilliance, then fires the shot. It rattles the cross bar. Newcastle try to clear, but it comes to Henderson. Henderson backheel passes a fair way outside the penalty box for GERRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRDDDDDDDDDDD 5-3!!!! WHAT A HIT SON, WHAT A HIT!!!

This is the fitting way to end this season.

I completely accept that it's not a perfect system, there will always be human error, shortages and dips in quality in any government-run system and we should absolutely keep campaigning for change, a social health organisation should be constantly changing to meet today's requirements. 

The NHS is a godsend for most people, myself included so whilst we're criticising waiting times, it would be good to remind ourselves of this from time to time.

Coming from a city that planned a 30 year building campaign for the city centre, and watched some fine buildings being levelled in place of concrete and chrome monstrosities, I'd say a lack of infrastructure investment is a double edged sword - on one hand, you have run down amenities and grubby streets but at least it exists if or when the economy picks up, on the other hand, you have a guarantee that your city will be in a permanent state of ""Will be better eventually"", where anything of any interest or use is ""coming soon"".

The employment situation is just as bad here, and the reasons aren't that dissimilar. With the closing of the Austin Rover fctory in Longbridge, I found myself signing on unemployed in the same week as 6000 new people had to sign on at the same Jobcentre. The area won't recover any time soon, despite the massive new development going up where the factory used to be.

In the rest of the city, it's oversaturation that's the problem. Too many people for far too few jobs - and we don't have the pressure valve of commuting for work because we're the biggest town around, so you have the choice of leave, tough it out or go self employed in a city where nobody's buying.

The rest of what you said sounds pretty much what I was expecting, or at least tempting. You're guaranteed to hear a siren every hour, and the police helicopter is overhead regularly.

I don't deny this at all. They might well do just that, and I support their right to (though they'll lose my business - I like bacon). 

If they do I'll get my bacon from somewhere else. There will *always* be demand, and demand creates supply - that's been proven by this whole Subway case. As for halal itself, I don't have a problem with it - I enjoy a kebab after a night out as much as the next guy.

I do agree the government should do what it can to make sure that every single animal is stunned before slaughter - IIRC someone posted on this sub yesterday that only around 80% of kosher and halal slaughters had the animal stunned before death. Not acceptable. 

&gt;Now think how it will be when a lot of the country has a high density of Muslims.

I'm not sure what your point is here, but surely if there are constituencies with a high concentration of Muslims we can reasonably expect this to be reflected in the MPs voted in to reflect these constituencies? Surely that's exactly how a parliamentary democracy works. 

What I want to know is what you're actually proposing here and why. Not trying to get a rise out of you, genuinely curious.

You said they had to need the weapons for defence before we should sell or give them to them. What if they're safe but some nutter starts a coup? Introduction and training on weapons systems takes half a decade. We can't predict who legitimately needs weapons far enough ahead for them to ve trained or equipped.



Countries will struggle to produce their own armaments. It takes a large amount of infrastructure and manufacturing capability,  as well as the complocated process of designed a functioning firearm.


At the moment we choose who we sell them to based off our own ethics. It will just be based off another set of ethics probably aligned with ours if we stopped selling them ourselves.



Your arguments are effectively that people dying is sad and the world is a mean place. We shouldn't sell weapons so we don't feel bad about being involved in any way with these sorts of situations. Weapons help people who need to defend themselves or innocents but they are also used by bad guys. Why shouldnt we sell better weapons to our allies so they can defend themselves with few casualties?

Coutinho is strange. When he first arrived he was inconsistent in that he played well vs the smaller sides and struggled against the top sides, he's switched that around this season.

&gt;The __Premier League Golden Glove__ is an annual [association football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) award presented to the [goalkeeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football\)) who has kept the most [clean sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout#Association_football) in the [Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League). For sponsorship purposes, it has been referred to as the __Barclays Golden Glove__ since its inception during the [2004–05 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004%E2%80%9305_FA_Premier_League). Unlike the [Premier League Golden Boot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League_Golden_Boot), which can be shared in the event of a tie,  the Golden Glove is won outright by a single player. Should there be a tie in the number of clean sheets, the goalkeeper with the superior clean sheets-to-games ratio receives the award.

Everything from the capitalist society we inhabit to the democracy we have leaves us totally vulnerable to being usurped from the inside. 

As you say, this is the point of democracy. But the way they go about it is pretty corrupt. They vote in blocks, and many people in these areas just give their postal vote or proxy vote to their Imams. Which really isn't the point of democracy. The fact their religion factors so strongly in how they vote should be indication enough of what will happen when they amount to 1/3 of the country. You need to bare in mind that's about the same percentage of India it took to tear off an entire third of the country for themselves (i.e. Pakistan). 

As for answers, I feel integration is key. Integration will not happen whilst they are constantly reinvigorating, generation on generation, with new blood by marrying their relatives. We need to ban first cousin marriage. And make it extremely difficult to bring in foreign spouses, unless a real connection can be shown. That means no arranged marriages within the community. This also has the bonus of eradicating forced marriage, and reducing birth defects from chronic inbreeding. 

We, the non-Muslim community, also need to start sticking up to Muslims and Islam in the way we do to all other faiths. We need to start actively telling them that their beliefs are bullshit and show the disregard for Mohammed we do for Jesus. We need to support those in their community who are forward thinking and progressive. And finally we need to stop children wearing any head gear. They are not old enough to make the choice, and by the time they even hit puberty the choice has been made for them.

true,dangercart,lfc68,,"Both of our models use gambling odds which aren't the same as probabilities but make a useful stand in because they're readily available. At this stage of the season gambling odds generally skew towards the favorite because they're trying to balance the betting and that's where the money is. I think all these posts have been open about that whenever it is questioned but it becomes more prevalent now because ""conventional wisdom"" and media coverage drives even more money to the favorites.

Draws for City and/or Chelsea don't change positions so that odds skew would make the position change probabilities be understated, if it exists. I agree that 3-4% seems low and if I were the type of gambler who just grinds against popular bet odds (I'm not a gambler at all) I would be betting on Liverpool to win the league as a slight value bet, though you could say the same thing about betting Chelsea to jump over us.

If you prefer the Bloomberg/Opta model they've actually updated their odds today to put it some more in our favor:

* City Odds: W 72.7%; D 16.3%; L 11.0%

* LFC Odds: W 61.2%; D 21.0%; L 17.8%

* Chelsea Odds: W 62.5%; D 20.8%; L 16.7%

Multiply to get odds:

* City Lose (0.11) * LFW Win (0.612) = 6.73% to win the title

* LFC Lose (0.178) * Chelsea Win (0.625) = 11.12%

I also support UKIPs policy of deporting foreign criminals and doing background checks on everyone who applies for residency, and turning away those who have a significant criminal history.

Compare that to the left wing position which is ""I support free movement of people between all EU countries"". 

&gt;uncontrolled immigration (who would be okay with that?)

Actually, there are quite a lot of far leftists who do believe in that. They believe in absolute free movement between all countries. Russell Brand is perhaps the most well known champion of this view. He thinks that ""the laws of supply and demand would even everything out"". People with this sort of view are simply too naive for the real world. Their idealism is based on feelings, not reality. You point out to these people that we simply cannot have open door immigration with countries like Somalia (where if you are white, there is a significant chance you will be murdered on sight if you go there), or Congo, or Liberia, and they will just call you a racist.

To them, it doesn't even register that they have been brought up in a culture with roads, hospitals, schools, common law, human rights, women's rights etc. They assume that these things are common across the entire globe, when in reality, some countries are so bad that you would have to go back thousands of years to find the last time Britain was full of such barbarism.

I've seen people in this sub arguing for absolute open door immigration, AND being upvoted for it. The sort of person who believes in this is likely to be a middle class leftist who lives in an affluent area, and who has absolutely no understanding of the world around them.

Yes and I'm saying that's completely unrealistic, rooftop solar cannot provide for 100% of a houses needs 100% of the time, even with battery back up (see boat explanation). Also what about industrial power use? I doubt a factory can be powered by rooftop solar. Whichever you look at it we need a grid connected to a 100% reliable power source.

&gt;As I said that article does not include future technology advances, add that variable and it is more reasonable.

true,docmuppet,eng-sussex,(near) Brighton,"This is actually how it works in a lot of other countries with free healthcare. The charge isn't there to make money but to save money. As it stands now there are thousands of missed appointments everyday and even more appointments that are completely pointless wasting huge amounts of GPs times and therefore money. 

Currently there are patients who think 

&gt;Oh no I have a cold! I must go see the doctor, maybe he'll give me antibiotics to kill this virus

and there's also patients who make an appointment, feel better by the time the appointment comes up and don't cancel it leaving the doctor sitting there twiddling his thumbs waiting for a patient. 

In both of these scenarios doctors are not helping people and wasting time. A £10 fee is at the same time high enough to prevent people going to the doctor for frivolous things (e.g. the patient with a cold), if £10 is too much money to see the doctor you probably don't need to see one, it's also something that could be refunded upon cancelling appointments, reducing the amount of time wasted across the board and increasing doctors availability. 

The argument against it is that, for some people, £10 is quite a lot of money but we already have a system in place for this with the waiving of prescription fees. Talking of systems already in place, you pay to go see the dentist and we haven't slid down a slippery slope there have we? Opticians are even privatised and they also operate an NHS voucher scheme for those who can't afford it. 

There's all this fear of the government privatising healthcare in the UK while people don't realise that a fair proportion of it is already privatised with dentists, opticians and chemists and this system works, what I would like to see is a privatised healthcare industry with the NHS taking on the management of healtchare in the same way it does with dentists etc rather than an operating role. 

Also don't forget that this vote is by doctors, not the government. The vast majority of doctors do not want to see a privatised system like the one in the US and moves towards that system will be opposed by the GMC, RCN, HCPC and BMA.

Cost of public service delivery &gt; Cost of public service delivery - Private sector efficiencies + Profit

It's worth explicitly breaking out the fact that the savings and profit all have to come from the efficiencies. 

IF the private firm is forced to take the staff from the public operation they either have the expensive task of firing pretty much everyone, or they have to change the culture and habits of the workers - also expensive in terms of lower productivity in the meantime, training, inevitable sackings and the fact it might simply fail. Already efficiency has been compromised. 

Even if the operation were more efficient, the company would have to decide how much money to pass on as savings. That's a tough one...how much money to give away...hmmm.

Do you know if the rules have finally been changed to put PFI/PPP back on the Government balance sheet? The reality of the situation seemed to be that in return for Government backed finance, Government responsibility to take over if the private company decided to bail and huge profits for the private company, the Government got to keep spending off the books and make misleading claims about being fiscally responsible and keeping within arbitrary limits while breaking them (looking at you Mr Brown).

&gt;I take it you don't own a mobile phone due to the materials used in it's manufacture coming from literal warzones where child slavery is rampant? 

I do own a mobile phone that was likely produced by a child in poverty, just as I do eat meat that was likely factory farmed, and I do wear clothes that have been made by people who work for a pittance.

Personally I don't feel comfortable with this, but nonetheless, a mobile phone is necessary for my job, and clothes are obviously necessary for day to day life. I am not very well off so I generally have to buy cheap food, cheap clothes, and a cheap phone.

true,docmuppet,eng-sussex,(near) Brighton,"They are, there's generally a couple of partner GPs and some salaried GPs who open a practice and take a contract from the NHS to provide GP services to a certain number of people, the more patients they have registered, the more money they get. 

It's why there is a trend of GPs expanding to have community nurses and more basic diagnostic and/or treatment facilities (some bigger ones even have a basic lab) since it brings them more money, it also provides more efficient care as you wont have to be referred out of practice for small things. 

It's all part of the Conservatives plan to make care more community, GP centered (I only mention this since /u/Malfren seems to think they are destroying the NHS). There is a shocking amount of misinformation in this thread centering around two main points:

1) If the NHS is privatised it will be like the US, this is completely wrong. It will be just like GP surgeries, Dentists, Pharmacies and Opticians are run now, hospitals and some ambulance services (G4S provide a lot of ambulance services now) are the last pieces that are still NHS operated. They are aiming for NHS to manage contracts to private healthcare providers rather than operating everything themselves, they will have standard requirements regarding cost which must be met (like the prescription charge is the same no matter which pharmacy you go to). 

2) Privatising healthcare will reduce quality of care, this is also wrong as even private practices today are subject to CQC investigation and are punished if this isn't met, I work for a private care home (which takes NHS contracts for some our residents) and the CQC have the power to fine me or put me in jail in the same way they could when I worked in the NHS. On top of this since private providers will not be able to charge fees beyond what is currently allowed in the NHS, will have budgets given to them by the NHS and the same minimum care standards as the NHS and enforced by the CQC their only option to increase profit margins is to increase efficiency and will have a greater motivation to do so than the NHS. 

**Important note:** I don't agree with privatisation, just pointing out in its current form privatisation does not mean the same system as the US. If it did the BMA would be making a much bigger fuss over it, potentially going as far as withdrawing non-emergency services.

The players on the sides of the diamonds do have responsibilities to get out wide when we're in possession and to slide over to help cover attacks down the flanks, but they're always going to sit more narrow and make the middle solid.  This places immense responsibility on our fullbacks to provide width both in attack and defense.

Johnson on his day is easily the best RB in the league, but he's been blowing so hot and cold this season and lately in an extended run of average form.  Flannagan has covered for Enrique quite well but he's having a ton asked of him and been a bit overwhelmed at times.

I disagree, I think meat eaters should be taking an interest in how exactly their meat is produced. I think there's a growing number of people who want to eat meat but who are sickened by cruelty in mass farming methods generally. Ignoring this, and telling others they should too, instead of having conversations about it and possible alternatives is lazy. 

I don't understand why people are so bothered by those taking a stance against halal on welfare grounds. Sure, some of them are maybe ignorant of how cruel general mass meat production is, but instead of telling them they're hypocrites, why not spread some information? And maybe some of them have done their research and choose to boycott halal as well as being very critical of other methods - you're just assuming, then, that they're hypocritical. Small changes are important.

true,LordMondando,null,null,"Thing is people base their opinons of the NHS far too much from personal experiences. When so, so many of the issues come from the fact that regional variations can be fucking MASSIVE. Further build into that is the quality of care, vastly depends on the condition.

For example, i'm a type 1 diabetic, generally speaking you get 3 10-20 minutes with a consultant per year, and thats if you nag. Fair enough if everything is going ok. Not if its not. Furthermore, quality of care is vastly different across the country. In Edinburgh for example you might be lucky enough to get the professor of endocronology at the teaching hospital as your consultant one time, and he might have looked at your file. Other times the first 3-4 minutes of the consult will be them figuring out what the fuck is your deal. 

I don't blame them. Why, it all comes down to resources. 

The fundamental problem is our system is essentially provision via primary healthcare trust. Which is given fixed budgets for a year, with all funds then having to be decided a prori. If a lot of kindey problems happen in that community this year, well if it goes over the amount of money allocated to Renal care, quality shoots down. 

You also because of the way this is all organised, have a lot of buercracy, some unnecessary, and a lot of fighting for budgets as well as the classic govt budget issue 'well if we don't spend it we will get less next year'. In short, it is FAR from a efficient system. 

Germany and France with an insurance system, when fund provision tracks what is actually going on, patient by patient is drastically better.

It also maps onto another problem funding, especially as the NHS has teaching and reserch roles, the money doled out by the state, is never going to be sufficient. This entire 'public v. private' argument is a false dichotomy. Some private investment is always required. The issue is how we go about it. Again this is somewhere with a single subsidised to fuck insurance system has an advantage over our current system. As demostrated by the PFI schanle, handing out 'x amount contracts with arbitary performance targets is a bad idea'. linking private involvement to individual patient care though, not as terrible. 

**TL;DR** For every good story there is one bad, so your personal experiences are not that relevant. What is important is that this stupid 'either as it is now or nothing' bullshit be put to bed. We can look to other nations with universal healthcare and see far better ways of it being done. There are good arguments as to the NHS being reformed.

I think you have the right idea with CityLets.  They were the defact place to go when I was looking (a long time ago) and they also have a short term lets section:

When I tried a search a lot of them came up with a price of ""Neg"" (as in ""Negotiable""), which was annoying, but I found putting a minimum price of £1 filtered those out and still left lots of fairly reasonably priced flats.


I feel obliged to warn you though, renting in the UK is notoriously problematic.  Unresponsive landlords that try their best not to give you your security deposit back are the norm.

If we want to be a team that only competes in the league and a couple cups, fine, but I hope that many of you share my dreams of fighting with the best of Europe. If we want to dream of competing with teams like Real and Bayern we need to start bringing in more talent now. Yea, I love Suso as much as the next guy here, but he is very young and very raw. I'd arguably say he had a worse season than Aspas had before we bought him, and look how that translated. Regarding that Pearce tweet saying we needed a new #10 , some people were saying ""but Suso is coming back"". Sorry, we don't need more squad rotation players. We need top talent that can perform week in and week out. Our dedication to youth development is key to long term stability, but should not make us think we don't need to spend big in the near future. Next season it will be MUCH harder to get 4th, especially now that Man U are getting a real coach. 

TL;DR Suso and the loan brigade will be great to add some depth to our bench. We still need to invest big to be able to compete at the highest level. Dismissing the need for another class forward or attacking midfielder because we have Suso and borini returning is ridiculous. 

Edit: we don't need squats rotation players that will be fighting for starting spots. We DEFINITELY need stronger squad rotations players, but I see that strength coming from some current starters being pushed to the bench.

Likewise, if Stevie gets pulled into a series of one two recycles you can see him edge up the pitch. At which point you have two DC spread really wide. I can't remember which game it was, maybe Norwich, where they switched to three up front on the counter to make that suicidal for us.

true,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;So it's more an issue of our legal system and the form the contracts take than with the privatisation itself?

Phoenixism is a problem entirely separate to the issue of privatisation.  

The entire purpose of a limited company is to limit the potential liability a participator in the company can face.  The same is true for limited liability partnerships.  

Companies are set up like the fire walls you see in some forests.  You may not be able to save one company, but you can let it go under without letting it burn the rest of your overall business in the process.  It’s not precisely about cheaping out, but it does mean that you have no incentive to leaving enough capital in a company in case things go bad.  In fact, it incentivises stripping as much capital as possible, so you don’t potentially lose it if that happens.

At the most extreme end you see the pre-pack administrations where the whole deal is arranged in advance of going into administration.  The administrator takes over the company and practically instantly sells it on to the new buyer for an already negotiated price.  On the up-side it means a business can continue trading and to be fair going in and out of administration can and has killed off salvageable companies in the past.  On the down-side it’s a mechanism for little more than shedding loads of debt in a fairly egregious way.

One fairly obvious solution would be to make companies hold reserves proportionate to their risk.  Essentially something similar to the reserve rules for the banks.  But this would simply lead to a lot of whining about being anti business.  I don’t see a measure like this ever making it into law.

Where it’s a particular problem with privatisation is that you’re looking at something that more or less **has** to be in place.  If a supermarket chain goes under the government doesn’t really have to step in, because there are other places to shop.  *(Yes, I’m ignoring the losses of jobs here.  I don’t believe the government (any flavour you like here) would step in to address that issue.)*  If on the other hand a mains water supplier, or an energy supplier, or a hospital goes under they can’t really just ignore that.

It is rather unimportant to me that Shias allow posters of Mohammed, or music during prayer. What we have on our hands are Sunnis. Sunnis will no doubt eventually wipe most Shias off the face of the earth if they have their way. That is, the radical 5-10% or so. 

Imagine if in this country 5-10% of Christians wanted a theocracy, and most other Christians were vaguely suppotive or ambivalent. What we'd have is a theocracy.

Civil servants don't have good business skills. They try to see things in the long term while their ministers are constantly wanting them to think in terms of the next election. Business is presently thinking in ridiculously short-term periods. CEOs have an average lifespan of 2-4 years and their shareholders aren't in it for the long-haul so quarterly results and analysts' opinions rule their minds. Large companies of the sort that will get PFI contracts are basically run by accountants and accountants will always take the money that is on the table today in favour of the higher reward that is available next week because they hate risk. So let's say that the Government requires 20% investment by the company in the project. As soon as that 20% is recovered and the contractor is making money it isn't going to be too worried about pulling out if there are dark clouds on the horizon. There might be a media stink, but that'll blow over and the Government seems to have both a short memory and limited choices in partners, so future government work doesn't seem too threatened. Just look at G4S being welcomed back (although I find their actions over charging for tagging far worse than their mess at the Olympics since the latter was rather outside their sphere of expertise). Same goes with all the failed IT projects, you'd think Seimans, Deloitte, Accenture, Capgemini and others would never get another IT or consultancy contract. Very much not so.

The healthcare system is generally frustrating for people in this country (America), but it's not like the majority or even large minority of people here are being denied coverage for common ailments or critical care. In fact, I'd argue that's part of the problem. Perhaps if more horrible situations were brought about, there'd be a greater urgency to positively overhaul our system.

I think both sides of the Atlantic have an exaggerated and altogether distrusting view of each other's healthcare. Your country appears to truly appreciate the value of human life and seems willing to make personal sacrifices for the good of its people. But many in the UK also seem to think America is positively medieval in our ways. Our healthcare is highly advanced and many if not most modern techniques were invented here(I hope there's no confusion there). Our trouble is deciding who should pay for them. But likewise, we drastically overestimate the cost and bureaucracy inherent in your system and fail to see the overall benefit to society. Some of that is mistrust in our already abhorrent government corruption and some of it is a general unwillingness to support people whom we believe to be unwilling to properly support themselves. I'm not saying these notions are universally true or even warranted, but I bet you'd commonly hear them around here.

Anyway, my point is: I think you may overestimate the extent to which we're incapable of providing you with healthcare. I agree our system needs drastic improvement, but don't forget that we somehow survive in spite of it and the most popular horror stories are trumpeted because they're uncommon to begin with, so you'll most likely be fine and I hope you enjoy your time here

&gt; In addition to the direction-of-traffic lane (left) being blocked by a barrier on a level crossing as a train approaches, there is also a second gate, which closes 10 seconds after the first, to prevent people going onto the other lane (the right lane) to weave around the barriers. It closes 10 seconds later than the first gate to enable anyone who is already on the crossing when the first one comes down to get off the crossing.

I thought you meant closing all the barriers 10 seconds later.

&gt; Adding a button inside the corssing so that anyone who gets stuck inside (say if traffic was heavy and they didn't have a means to leave the crossing, having moved onto it in the first place as a result of being a plonker) can press the button, which opens the exit barriers only, and causes red lights all along the track to light up and alert the train driver to stop. This button therefore (a) allows a trapped car the opportunity to escape the level crossing and (b) means the train is stopped before it hits anything if the car cannot get off in time.

I like this idea. Not sure how easily it could be implemented but as far as I know, normally the railway signals protecting level crossings are not cleared to allow trains to proceed until the crossing barriers are down. Of course this could still happen even if there is a vehicle blocking the crossing, although many crossing on main lines are also monitored by CCTV, and newer installations use [radar and lidar systems](http://www.psimagazine.co.uk/newsdetail.php?newsID=1532) to scan for obstructions as part of the closing sequence.

&gt; Of course, teaching people not to go on level crossings if the exit isn't clear or if the lights are flashing will help too. Seems not enough people got that memo.

I'm not really sure what more the railways can do. Network Rail have run various campaigns but you still hear of cars being hit by trains on crossings.

The problem is that the government has been subsidising these services and others in order to insulate people living in remote places from the true costs of their isolationism. This has led people to migrate en masse (compared with a free market counterfactual) to these remote areas, bringing private money (shops, residential investors etc.) with them. Some of this activity is artificial and inefficient economically. However, politically, no one would be bold enough to suggest the subsidies should be retracted and the true costs realised by the individuals; this would lead to a lot of economic upheaval, as people came to re-assess their decisions to reside in the 'idyllic countryside'.",0,1399562746,null,0,1399565615,0,chcri8h,t3_25178x,t1_chcri8h,t1_chcpek7,null,1433706411,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Now, I have never felt so overworked and stressed. I have frequent moments of irrationality; allowing myself to utterly despair about the future and 'whats next', to contemplating suicide and worrying about everything and anything when things go wrong. 

I love the research I do, but I hate the life that goes with it. If I continue down this route things will only get worse, as research = life. I don't know any academic who can switch off from their work. 

My biggest fear is job security. As a postdoc you will go from contract to contract, from 6 months to a year, until you are lucky enough to find a lecturing role (if thats what you want to do). 

The greatest pressure is publishing. I managed to get 6 peer reviewed papers published in my PhD and it nearly killed me, yet my supervisor tells me I could of got far more! That expectation is insane! 

Isolation is a big thing as well, unless you are in a big research team you pretty much work by yourself, sit by yourself, and stay in your office. The research culture might change from university to university, but from my experience the academics tends to keep to themselves, focus on their own research, and worry about themselves.

Personally, I'd give anything to go back 4 years and continue with the job I had. Perhaps i'd have a mortgage by now, be earning a fair chunk more etc etc. I would have regrets, as I truly enjoy my research, but I frequently question was it worth all the stress, financial worry, time away from family and so on....

&gt; To know the validity of research we need to understand who funds the papers, who funds the institutions, the backgrounds of the authors... etc etc.

Yes we do, although all the papers I linked to were peer reviewed papers in trustworthy journals, so generally unless you have evidence otherwise I'm going to believe them. But you do bring me nicely onto,

&gt;I repeat that the expert on the radio program stated ""no evidence that you get long term increase in yield with GM over time""

What is his background? Who funds his research? You can find a single scientist who will come out and support almost any viewpoint, hell there are still loads that deny climate change. However what matters is scientific consensus and that is mostly optimistic about the benefits of GM.

&gt; Some of them say regulation is a problem, but all businesses say they need to be regulated and taxed less.

Businesses do normally moan about any sort of regulation but when that regulation is ""You will not conduct GM trials in the UK"", I think they may have a point.

&gt;But Nuclear power is more expensive... are you happy to pay that price?

Its not a case of paying extra so that I don't have to look at all those ugly wind turbines, this isn't NIMBYism. We need that land, we need it to feed people from (especially as apparently we aren't going to be allowed to use GM) we need it for people to live on. 

I can see the confusion, I imagine in your mind you picture a world where every house has a wind turbine and solar panels on the roof and that supplies their needs. But that doesn't work, it won't supply all the power the country needs. Even the sources you've posted don't think that works, that article called for ""3.8 million **large** wind turbines."" That isn't a wind turbine in every garden, that is the monsters with 100m blade lengths which are 170m high in groups of hundreds covering hundreds of square miles.

Having a ""B"" team allows the team to maintain training oversight just like the U21/18 but instead of the players facing other kids in matches that mean nothing they play in the league structure they are playing other teams in the league will be filled with men who are fighting so they can make a living or make their name known to other teams. 

The clubs will be fighting against relegation to conference or promotion up the chain. Clubs will be fighting for better position as it has an economic impact. Supporters of other club will be very concerned with results as it could mean their club getting a chance to progress up the food chain.

I think it is a good way to get the kids some experience while maintaining the oversight. Gets them used to playing a high number of matches in a situation where the talent level of what they are facing and the experience of the opponents is a different level.

I'm sure there will be some more loopholes on the roster requirements that would allow for a set amount of older players that would make space for the ""late bloomers"" but also provides a visible competition for players who are headed into a ""late bloomer"" situation to market themselves to additional employers.

&gt;__Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton__, [CVO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Victorian_Order), [OBE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_British_Empire) [FRGS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow_of_the_Royal_Geographical_Society) (/ˈʃækəltən/; 15 February 1874 – 5 January 1922) was a polar explorer who led three British expeditions to the Antarctic, and one of the principal figures of the period known as the [Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroic_Age_of_Antarctic_Exploration). Born in [County Kildare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Kildare), Ireland, Shackleton and his [Anglo-Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Irish) family  moved to [Sydenham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydenham) in suburban London when he was ten. His first experience of the polar regions was as third officer on Captain [Robert Falcon Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Falcon_Scott)'s [Discovery Expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_Expedition), 1901–04, from which he was sent home early on health grounds. Determined to make amends for this perceived personal failure, he returned to Antarctica in 1907 as leader of the [Nimrod Expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimrod_Expedition). In January 1909, he and three companions made a southern march which established a record [Farthest South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farthest_South) latitude at 88° 23′ S, 97 [geographical miles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_mile) (112 [statute miles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_mile), 180 km) from the [South Pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pole), by far the closest convergence in exploration history up to that time. For this achievement, Shackleton was knighted by [King Edward VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Edward_VII) on his return home.

true,miomike,null,null,"Hi! Welcome to /r/SaintsFC, I'll have a go at answering your questions. I tend to write a lot, so... My bad if it's all too long. 
 

Q1) Obviously being a Saints fan, I've not watched United play a lot this season, and best I can say is that I've seen a couple of games and ""highlights"" on Match of the Day. However, I've felt that the players are at least as much to blame as Moyes. It's all good saying Moyes' tactics were bad (and often they seemed to be pretty poor), but too often the players just failed to perform. Sometimes looking like a group of kids playing a group of adults, just chasing shadows and barely able to get the ball. Either way, I felt Moyes deserved time to try to rebuild, but equally I think that he'd lost both the fans and players (none of which are used to hardship) and so it would have been difficult for him. I have almost no opinion on the appointment of Van Gaal, I know nearly nothing about him and in all honesty think it'll take a massive squad overhaul to return to your previous greatness. The best thing that came about from Man United's season is that I'd never have thought Saints would be 1 place below them.
 


Q2) I've never liked Rooney, but that's in part because I never liked the hype about him when he was brand new onto the scene. Although he plays well for United, he's usually proven to be ineffectual or an outright risk for England, and I don't like that his place in the squad is always a given.

I can't say that I specifically like any United players; although Mata can be outstanding on his day and just an unbelievable player, as can Van Persie, though he was a risky buy in the first place top scorer or not. I also quite like the look of Zaha, and wouldn't mind him at Saints to add to our young English attacker set, we could do with another attacking player with pace, but that's totally beyond the point. My Bad.
 


Q3) I put it all down to our playing style, and therefore Poch. He doesn't lie when he says we play the same way against Chelsea or Cardiff, home or away. We try to keep possession, push high up the pitch and have some amazing players that sometimes manage to help us break down defences.... and sometimes don't. It doesn't always work, and can lead to winning and controlling a game, or to lose to a sucker-punch goal or counter attack. It can also be frustrating to have so much possession but nothing to show for it sometimes, but an extra creative player and J-rod back could help with that.
 


Q4) I definitely feel there's a chance our star players will stay. Team spirit and whatnot are good, a lot of the players are friends, a lot have played together for years, up through the leagues and beyond, and a lot are young and also starting to get noticed at an international level, which is sometimes seen as something reserved only for the top teams. There's always a chance they'll go, Shaw and Lallana especially would cost a hell of a lot though. Current wonderkid and high chance of future England fullback for years, and one of the top English attacking midfielders in a number of years (in my personal opinion) means they're worth a lot anyway, and a rich club with good finances means we're not under pressure to sell at all. Obviously it can all change, but whatever happens I don't expect the exodus of players that the papers say. I think at the last total there were a good 7 players from our first team linked with moves away, which obviously is ridiculous.
 


Q5) I think with continued investment, and a bit less injury problems in key positions/better cover for those key positions *cough* goalkeeper *cough* and we might be able to do similar to Everton, and close the gap between us in 8th and European places. Maybe not Europe straight away, but I'd like to imagine if everything went as well as it could then we'd be able to look like more of a threat for European spots.
 


Q6) Nope. City have got it now. I don't see West Ham winning at the Eithad. Even if they stopped City from scoring then I don't see West Ham getting a goal, and the goal difference City have over Liverpool will be the key thing even if West Ham hold them to a draw. And should West Ham miraculously win, and Liverpool not pull a Crystanbul again (love that term), then I will give £10 to a charity of a United fan's choosing, while also being happier for it because I'd like Liverpool to win it.
 


Q7) I can't see it ending well for us because our current lack of ability to score. We keep creating very little with a ridiculous amount of possession and when we do no-one can manage to actually get the sodding ball in, minus a freak occurrence/mistake *a la* Everton &amp; Swansea. We really miss Rodriguez. 

What United team comes out depends on how well I think they'll do, with Giggs currently doing a fair bit of rotation there's always a chance we could pull something off, but I see this being a draw at best for Saints and a United win not unlikely - Of course I want a win, and there might be no better time to get it, but I don't hold high hope, a lot of our players look tired and already thinking of their holidays.

Although I'm techinically registered to a specific doctor, the way my surgery works is that they just slot you into whichever doctor they have a space for.  They also stop you making appointments more than a couple of days in advance.

*(This is a huge pain in the backside, since it's nigh impossible to get the same doctor when they say to you, ""Make an appointment to see me in x weeks.""  I've explained this to the reception staff and their response is to tell me that there ARE appointments available, but they're locked away until the morning in question for emergencies.)*

During the incident I mentioned I didn't see the same doctor twice.  This is part of why I get so angry about it.  It's not one incompetent idiot.  It's enough of them that I often think it's systematic.

I think the key is you need to describe things properly. Going and saying you have a cough, have them listen to your chest and hear crackling is *not enough* for a diagnosis of bacterial lower respiratory tract infection, or pneumonia. 

I semi-guarantee anyone that has a cough and describes their sputum colour will get an accurate diagnosis after percussion. If your sputum is clear (*not grey*) or general phlegm colour (green) it's likely viral. Not 100% of the time, but usually. If it's brown, grey, yellow, blackish, red, then there is a problem.

true,TracyMorganFreeman,null,null,"Singapore's system is rather unique. It utilizes medical savings accounts which people are required to contribute to, but they utilize their own money(and can spend it family members should they wish), it employs public hospitals but they are independently administrated which has them functionally compete with each other, along with competing with private hospitals. Nothing is *fully* subsidized except the poorest of the poor, and there are different levels of quality-and the portion of your savings account that can towards each.

It essentially creates a floor for the poor, but overall has people engaging in cost-benefit analyses with their own funds. This leads to more efficient use of resources. They have publicly available insurance as an option as well. Their taxes are lower and they actually spend only about 3% of their GDP on healthcare, and only 31% is via government(compared to 45-50% for the US and ~85% for the UK IIRC).

It's an intriguing idea, but I'm not confident it would work on a national scale. Singapore is essentially a large city. It's very possible it could work at the municipal/state level which each being handled independently, but it's hard to say.

The US is kind of a different animal on the other end of the spectrum to Singapore. It's highly ethnically diverse, its population is greatly spread out, etc. It's quite possible the US will need a specifically tailored system, much like Singapore needed(although not necessarily the same kind of system Singapore has).

Nonetheless, Singapore's system is in many ways functions more like a market than the US, where competition is stymied in many places, particularly due to certificate of need laws, the FDA(who will even disapproves drugs based on cost, not safety), and laws preventing competing insurance policies across state lines. The US system is increasingly becoming an oligopoly, which is where problems with privatization occurs, but is not inherent with all privatization.

One of the issues I fear is overlooked in the debate is that when looking at the various socialized systems, costs vary considerably. This raises a very important question: what are the other factors at play, and what is their impact? I don't know the answer to that question, but we must account for these factors before making any kind of claim positive, negative, or neutral as to the impact of the presence/absence of UHC systems, especially after distinguishing between nationalized single payer like the NHS, socialized single payer like Canada and South Korea, insurance mandates like Germany and Switzerland, and the kooky hybrid that is Singapore.

I did a small research project on this but it barely scratched the surface. What I did find that two factors were particular of note, at least from the data I did have: median household income and portion of cost that is out of pocket. Here are graphs of those:

[Median Household Income](http://imgur.com/vMw56ou)

[Portion Out of Pocket](http://imgur.com/CWaOyR3)

Clearly the conversation doesn't stop there, but in fact I think that's where it should start, and we should look further into the impact of said factors. It's also notable that the data points that clearly deviate from the trend in each graph is the US(and to a lesser extent Turkey and Mexico on the other ends), raising further questions.",0,1399566297,null,0,false,0,chct7iy,t3_25178x,t1_chct7iy,t1_chcsot2,null,1433707213,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"I agree that the loan system can be effective but i can see the appeal of a B team to the big clubs.

With a loan you are sending a player out that you have a set of expectations for so they can get some experience. However when you send the player on loan, you lose oversight on the training of your own player you also lose influence on how much game time the player gets. One of the hardest things about the loan system is for the big teams to find a team where they know and trust the coaching staff (and just like the big team that coaching staff can change somewhere during the season) to train your players in a manner you want as the parent club.

A ""B"" team allows you to effectively get all the same benefits of a loan without giving up control of training and development which allows you  to utilize more players from within your academy and not have to wait for a chance to loan someone out. If a kid starts performing well in training you simply start playing him in games.

The issue with the quota is that it damages the quality of the league. The PL is advertised as ""the biggest league in the world"" and ""the most competitive league in the world""....once you start putting in a quota for player to be from a certain nation you start effecting the quality.  

The biggest clubs are always going to be able to afford to have the best English players. But a club like Norwich or a club like Cardiff, if they lose a couple players from the the squad (which already is going to be less laden with talent than the big boys) to injury you start forcing them to play a player simply because he is English not because he is the best player. Addtionally you will have a chain reaction, the bigger teams will keep buying the best English players and the team that loses them will have to replace them because of the money the teams higher up the food chain will poach from teams down the food chain, loans will dry up since teams will want to keep their most talented players close by so they can use them.  The overall quality of the league will start to drop because you aren't stressing the best talent just the most local talent. Once quality drops, interest drops, once interest drops money drops etc.

I would say one of the things that the FA really needs to do is encourage players to try and play abroad. England exports very few players to other leagues, means the players don't get exposed to different training and mentality to the sport, rather than having clubs like United, Chelsea, City stock piling players to meet a quota (or even abide by the current homegrown rules) the players would be out looking for their best situation regardless of where that situation is located. Additionally it would also raise the profile of English players. Raising the profile of English players only helps the PL and the FA in the end.",0,1399566637,null,0,false,0,chctdkt,t3_251oqt,t1_chctdkt,t1_chcsl4i,null,1433707291,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

Chadli especially looks great in that midfield position, he is comfortable on the ball and makes dangerous passes. He is easily my #2 choice in the midfield behind eriksen. Paulinho confuses me. He has shown to be a great ball winner, and has half-games here and there where he makes brilliant passes and runs, but can disappear for long periods.

Positionally as well you can tell he's not at the same level as other CDMs. He doesn't push out to the wings to cover for the fullbacks which is a very important aspect of the CDM role in our setup. We are so defensively vulnerable against teams with pace on the wings. 

It's a very big problem and the reason we most likely have not won the league this year. This is also the reason why Henderson is so important to our team currently. He basically does the running of two midfielders and makes up for Stevies inability to do so. The only way we can effectively play Stevie as a CDM without compromising our defensive stability is signing another athletic CDM to play alongside him. 

Lucas is a quality CDM who reads the game well but you can't play both him and Stevie together because they both lack pace / the ability to cover ground. It's no surprise we gave away 3 goals against CP in the last 10 minutes with both of them playing. With the current way we play it's very hard to find a suitable role for Stevie which can't be filled better by someone else. I personally believe a midfield of Lucas / Henderson / Coutinho is much better than any other combination of Stevie / x / x because it is the most balanced, but it would take some massive bollocks from BR to actually drop Stevie considering he's been one of our best players this year.

1. Man United haven't had a good season at all. Looking back at your previous seasons there has been a large drop in form. Admittedly I haven't seen much of United this season. In regards to Moyes being sacked, I honestly thought at the beginning of the season he would be given a couple of seasons to settle in and make his mark. I feel that Van Gaal will be a good manager for United. He's managed top teams and won League Trophies across 2/3 leagues and he's won the CL. He's got a lot of experience which will be beneficial. But at the end of the day no one knows how it will turn out.


2. As I said in the point above I haven't seen that much of United but I've liked the look of De Gea and Januzaj.


3. Pochettino. He has got the team playing some really nice attacking football. There are some disadvantages with it like the counter attack because we press high up the pitch. But it has definitely paid off.

4. I'm hoping both will stay with us. Our director has come out and publicly said that they want to keep the players and will probably decline any offers which pumps some confidence among the fans.

5. Pochettino has taken us to 8th with our record tally of points. I think he can take us a lot further. The fact that other teams fighting for CL spots want him says a lot.

6. I don't think so. Man City have won the title.

7. With J Rod out we've been struggling to score recently. I'm going for 1-1 or a loss.",0,1399566801,null,0,1399578977,0,chctghm,t3_251nvy,t1_chctghm,t3_251nvy,null,1433707331,4,false,SaintsFC,t5_2tboa,4

true,henryboeree,null,null,"Hi there, I don't how much other Saints will agree with my answers but i'll give them a go anyway!

1) Obviously this wasn't your best season by any stretch and it must have been strange going from expecting to win every game to getting such mediocre results. I do think Moyes is a great manager and I'd quite like to see him at St.Mary's should Pochettino leave but I think he was just out of his depth at United and it felt watching you play like the team was fighting against what he was trying to create. Having said that he made consistent tactical errors of judgement and never really dealt with the problems in the squad effectively. I do think however the way in which he was sacked was not what should be seen from any club, let alone United.

2) I think my favourite of your players this season is probably DeGea, who's been at your rescue countless times this season, without him I honestly think we'd be finishing above you. For players I like I'm not too sure, I have huge respect for Giggs and think Mata's world class on his day but as a team the attitude has put me off and portrayed some in your team as the cliche overpaid ego's which brings a bad name to the game.

3) I think our success comes from the last 3/4 seasons. We have a very similar squad to what we had in the Championship and the majority of our player have improved dramatically and kept to the pace of the Premier League. I think Pochettino has done wonders for our playing style, we never used to close teams down and we never really had much imagination in attack apart from the individual efforts of Walcott and Bale when we had them. I think Adkins did an incredible job in installing an ethos in our team and giving the players belief that they could play Premier League football.

4) Most of it is speculation at the moment, but there will be bids for players like Shaw and Lallana in the summer and we'd be lucky to keep hold of both of them. Personally I'd like them to stay at least one more season, it would kill me to see shaw go somewhere and be sat on the bench the whole season but it's up to them and down to whether Saint's have the ambition to be challenging for Europa League  places.

5) I think within 2 season's we could be challenging for Europa League but equally I can see us having a dud season, finishing 13/14th and firing Poch. The thing about being a saints fan is you have to know never to get your hopes up too much, we have a habit of shooting ourselves in the foot.

6) As much as I'd like to see Liverpool win for how outstanding they've been this season I can't see City messing it up now, having said that, they came pretty close against QPR 2 seasons ago and if it hadn't been for Joey Bartons classic idiocy they may not have won it.

7) I think a 1-1 draw seems pretty likely, neither team have any reason to really go for it and there's quite a few players on both teams who won't want to risk any kind of injury before the World Cup.

Offensive speech is a LOT broader because basically anyone can be offended by anything and it is more to do with the effect on those offended.

Then you have the grossly offensive thing.... which is where things get a bit grey... someone maybe decides to make a public joke about a recently dead kid or something, so if after the Bulger boy was killed and Twitter was around at the time I said on there ""God I hope they ****ed him before they killed him"" (I'm not typing it, use your imagination) or something like that, that would probably come into the grossly offensive thing because it was intentionally put out for the whole world to see on the net. It's not hate speech because it's wishing something on a dead person, the person is already dead, you can't encourage something in the past like that, but it's fucking bad in my opinion and I have no problem locking up people who write stuff like that. 


At least that's how I see it, there is always going to be personal interpretation because it's rarely black and white. I just keep the sick jokes for private communications anyway.

true,rockstarsheep,eng-Oxfordshire,London,"You should get a subscription my friend. It’s pretty reasonable imo. I got one for a family member, as they ship internationally for a little extra. Not much though. 

I can see your point of view on what we might term, relative corruption in developed vs. non-developed countries. I would caveat and say, the levels of poverty are far starker in comparison though, so if we were to some aggregated and weigh up the relative impacts, the developed nations can absorb the costs, without too badly impacting their constituents. That’s not to demean anyone, anywhere, it is more to say, here a lot of issues are luxuries, compared to a lack of basic necessities, we’d take for granted here. There are not too many houses without toilets and running water over here. I hope :)

I quite agree with you that there are a lot of individuals who’re mentioned in Private Eye, that you never hear about in any {as far as I am aware} other newspaper. Many moons ago, I was doing some consulting work for a private company that had public sector connections. On the board of this company sat a certain Sir Something Something. He’d managed to procure £50,000 for some wallpaper for his house, on the taxpayers tab too, I might add. There was a bit of tut tutting and haw hawing. And we’re talking 2000 here. Yes, he was a naughty boy, and he got a little ticking off, but as far as I was made aware by a colleague, the wallpaper looked rather nice. Matched the furniture quite nicely, apparently. I kept my mouth shut, and just nodded. 

Now you might call me a tinfoil hat wearing loon, but here’s my little thought, for what it matters or doesn’t. I think that there’s an awful lot of dodgy dealings going on here, backhanders and whatnot, and that the likes of Private Eye, just scrape the surface. What sort of amuses me, is that in the good old US of A, the lobby groups are at least out there in the open and you can have a go at them. Here they seem to be rather hidden in the woodwork. Let’s take money laundering, I mean, offshore bank accounts and so on. A Dutch documentary last year had various interesting individuals who influence UK economic policy and tax policy, rather openly discussing how they, whilst working for the big consulting firms, wrote or re-wrote the laws to suit the large multinationals. Strange, I thought, why did we not hear about this over here? Surely, if it is our taxes being used, we ought to know a little more. But maybe not. There will be another panel comedy show or something else to distract our attention from what’s quite important. I now do sound like I need a tinfoil hat. Hope it’s a branded one!

I think Capitalism, as we know it, well, it might be a little misunderstood. You see, as I see it, it encourages incentive based rewards for a certain amount of risk and investment to gamble on the success of a product or service. The most commonly convertible incentive, is money. Capitalism V1, which I think we’ve contended with for a very long time, never really had to factor in the environment. It was viewed as rather benign. That we suddenly, “SURPRISE!” have had to take notice of our use, misuse, and sadly, abuse of the planet, shouldn’t come as a surprise. Those clever chaps over at The Rand Corporation and no doubt, other think tanks with boffins over here, knew that we’d face some challenges, as far back at the late 50’s. Who listens to Negative Nancy’s though? I mean, they’re scientists after all. What do they really know? Apparently, more than what was paid attention to. 

Now, there will be those, who say that this is “all part of the game” and that we should let The Market, solve the problems we find in front of ourselves. Maybe this would work, if we didn’t see the tendency towards oligarchy and the various other archy family members rising to prominence. With the laws that were put in place to keep balances and checks, watered down or washed away, things become a little more complex. In my minds eye, this summons up the image of a poster advertising a pill to stop heroin abuse. We have a visual of a forearm, that has been drilled and mined away with some ugly scars, yet now with a healthy hue, wherever possible and an upbeat message. “Suzy took the pill and is now happy as can be!” In the same way, we may be able to “cure” a lot of the destruction, but the scars are going to be around for a very long time.

I like the sound of these e-readers. I was rather hopeful to get Raspberry Pi computers in to South Africa, so I actually went to go to talk to someone in regional government, who had national influence as well. Things looked hopeful, until there was the realisation that there’d be very small margins to be made, and so, my proposal was shelved. I still think there’s legs on it.

* ""marginal consumers"": The benefit imparted by a user of infrastructure is not only to the owner of that infrastructure.

* ""true costs"": The cost of expensive access to public transport is not only to the ""consumer"", it is also to their destination, in the form of more road congestion and pollution caused by more single-occupant vehicles in use as an alternative.  Even commuting between 2 cities, I found it cheaper to travel by car than by public transport.
* ""their isolationism/their decisions"": Many people in these ""marginal consumers"" are not there by conscious choice, but have fallen into that location by default, for example growing up there or having retired whilst living there.  Making it more expensive to participate does not magically give them the resources to change location, in fact removes them.  Those that are deliberately isolationist are generally in a position to afford it.

Anyway, for me the issue is that it's an easy way for those dodgy touts to work illegally without being noticed. The idea behind Uber is a lift-sharing service which is fine when used altruistically or by legal vehicles, but Uber is easily abused and that's what irks me. The legal framework is in place to protect the public and Uber is unintentionally eroding that safety.

London taxi drivers are famously bullish, so their gripe might be that 'THEY'RE NICKIN' OUR WORK', or Taxi vs Private Hire v2. If that's the case they need to shut up. The sort of people who are using Uber legitimately to get a lift are not the sort of people who are going to be getting proper taxis anyway. 

To answer your earlier question (and to get back on topic), the basic upshot of meters is that:

• All public hirings (i.e. from the street, flagged-down, or from a rank, or other method of hiring which is not through a registered booking office), must have the fare calculated by a taximeter of an approved type being set to the tariff as instructed by the licensing authority.

Taximeters of an approved type are used because they cannot be fiddled. You need specialist equipment in order to reprogram the tariff on these, and they are certified measuring devices which work off the speed of the car and thus accurate. Phones or other devices are a) not as accurate and b) can be fiddled. This is so that provided the vehicle takes the shortest legal route, the passenger does not get ripped off.

• Private Hirings (i.e. through a registered booking office, either to a Taxi or a Private Hire Vehicle) do not have to make use of a taxi meter. The fare can be agreed beforehand. Other measuring devices such as taximeter apps can be used provided the customer can see them and can ask what the tariff is.

Therefore, the meter issue wouldn't be an issue if hirings from Uber were private hirings. But as Uber isn't a taxi or private hire company, and doesn't have any form of operating license. Thus these jobs are taken as public hirings, taking a booking through Uber is the same as if the person flagged you down on the street.

Conclusion:  We don't have much to bitch about when it comes to net spending as we've spent plenty (3rd most in the last 5 years), but City and Chelsea have spent gobs more than everyone else and it wouldn't surprise me to find out their net spend over the last 5 years is more than the other 18 teams in the league combined over those years.  Would actually be interesting to find out, but would take a while.

Yes, big heavy moving objects are dangerous. But our society cannot function without these big heavy moving objects.

We could just be happy with how safe children are these days, and how much less likely they are to be killed by other things - such as disease/malnutrition/war - than at any time in history. (although there's the problem that they're often over-protected and don't get enough exercise....)

Road traffic isn't going away. Even as we move beyond the 'oil age'. 

HS2 has proven that we can't build railways any more (too expensive, too many NIMBYs). Cycling will always be a fairly niche option (Can't carry goods, UK weather, old/unfit people, and crazy levels of bike theft). So nothing will change, and petrol cars will just be gradually replaced by electric.

&gt;If a black person says ""I don't like white people"" is it prejudiced? Yes. Is it racism? No.

Utter nonsense. 

Racism is the prejudice belief that someone is lesser because of their skin colour or race.

If a black person says they don't like white people it's no different to a white saying the reverse.  

&gt;Because they are in no position of power to stop you from doing anything.

Completely irrelevent. Racism isn't defined by active discrimination, merely a prejudice.

&gt; They do not have the majority population to persecute you. 

See above.

&gt;They can't stop you from getting a job. They can't stop you from being served. Etc etc.
 
These are different examples of racism, more extreme yes, but they don't change the context of the original statement and certainly don't stop it being a racist remark.

Racism is the categorical discrimination or generalisaton of a race, like when people call all Americans fat self imposed pricks. It's racist. Or when English say the Welsh shag sheep, it's racist.

Q1) Obviously a massively disappointing season for a team used to such success. I was a fan of Moyes at Everton, he did a great job there. I had always thought that the big teams should give more chances to the managers who have proven themselves at smaller teams, so I was pleased when Moyes arrived. But it just seemed like he  constantly underestimated the size of the club. A loss at home isn't a ""setback"" for Man United, it's devastating and all over the media.

I hope van Gaal comes in for the same reason I was happy Mourinho came back to Chelsea. I'm not concerned whether you do well or not, but van Gaal seems to make drama as well which is good for the neutral and gives us more stuff to talk about in the pub.

Q2) I like Cleverley. Not because of his play, but because he is hated so much. We didn't like our backup left back, Danny Fox. But when a United player is hated, he needs a super thick skin to just go on the internet. Carrick was criticized for passing sideways too much as well. Cleverley will get a lot better.

Also I'm a big Shinji fan, and I think Smalling is overrated.

Q3) We have a very good first 11. If injuries weren't a part of the game, I think we would have been in Europe. When we have the whole squad healthy, we really surprise people, like at the beginning of the year. However with just 1 or 2 injuries it shows just how far we have to go to catch the big clubs.

Q4) I think it is more likely they are all going to stay than anyone important leaving this year. The team spirit is amazing, and everyone is believing in the club. One of the big reasons that young players cited for leaving us early was to get international recognition, which no longer is required. I don't think Oxlade-Chamberlain would have gone to the Euro's if he didn't move to Arsenal. Now, it's basically leaving for more money, and our wages aren't particularly low.

Q5) I don't think Poch is ready for a club of Man United's size yet. I think he will stay with us for a couple more years because we are on the rise and will continue to make him look good.

I have a hard time imagining us getting higher than 8th with just our own improvement. Need some other team to fall apart so we can catch them.

Q6) Liverpool will beat Newcastle by 15 giving them the better goal difference. But Man City wins their game.

Q7) We will boss you around for 75% of the game. 0-1 final score, Fellaini bicycle sealing it for you. We will finish the game with 4 18 year olds and a 19 year old on the park, and you will get credit for playing James Wilson.",0,1399570567,null,0,false,0,chcvd93,t3_251nvy,t1_chcvd93,t3_251nvy,null,1433708229,8,false,SaintsFC,t5_2tboa,8

true,chaosabordine,null,null,"I've been keeping this to myself for the last couple of months so obviously it's a bit outdated now and it sort of assumed it would come down to Liverpool and Chelsea but anyway, here goes:

Picture if you will, a bright sunny day at Anfield where would-be champions Liverpool are 2 points clear of Chelsea and are facing a struggling Newcastle who are already 4-0 down in the first minute. Half-time comes and goes and the players are waiting for the formality that is the second half to end and the fans are in high-spirits. Chelsea are winning their game against some other team but none one cares, even their own fans. All eyes are on this one. We approach the 89th minute and Newcastle are kicking off for the record-breaking 42nd time this game when suddenly...

...Who else but Brendan ""fuckmotherin'"" Rodgers walks onto the pitch. The crowd is silent momentarily as the entire world is trying to figure out what's about to happen. In his hand the whole time was a microphone...

""You've all been fooled. Played. Like chumps"", he begins before holding a hand to his face.
""It was ME ALONG!""

He removes what turned out to be a mask and beneath that mask was the visage of none other than DAVID. MOYES.

""You thought this was Liverpool all along"", and at this point the entire Liverpool squad do the same as their manager. What we had once believed to be Sturridge was actually Van Persie. Suarez was actually the 3rd reincarnation of Shrek. Sterling was Januz... Janizu... tha one up-and-coming guy that plays for United while on the bench Kagawa rubs his hands together at this masterplan. The logos on the kits turned out to be United kits with Liverpool-related stickers haphazardly attached.

The Sky Sports commentators go insane. ""OH SON OF A BITCH!"" The sentiments exactly of Liverpool's fans who just found out they had been lured into Old Trafford instead of Anfield. They cut to what we had assumed was the real United to see a depressed BR watching his team fall to thier improbable 40th loss of the PL season, losing to themselves twice somehow but still finishing in exactly the same spot as last year.

The casters cut back to Anfield where a grinning Moyes is being booed by the crowd for double-crossing... someone or something (the casters had to censor half of his plan for being NSFW) when suddenly, the stadium goes dark. Somehow. Then the floodlights smash.

And the theme of Stone Cold Jose Mourinho blares across the PA. ""He's here! It's Stone Cold! Stone Cold!"" and it turns out Rui Feraro Roche was managing the Chelsea game but noone noticed. Mourinho gives Moyes a beer before telling him how he doesn't give a damn about this plan. He then proceeds to Stunner every single member of United's squad and staff before drinking more beer. As United are no longer unable to fight (i.e. get up before the 10 count), they surrender and lose 3-0 by default and Chelsea win the title at Wrestlemania.

And that's the story of how Chelsea thwarted United's evil(?) plan. I'm so glad I thought to write that down while I remembered it after I woke up that time..

Every connection to a network, in virtue of the fact one computer needs to know where to send information to another, leaves a footprint, you can encrypt the fuck out of that and use a complex system of proxies. 

But the only method of encryption that cannot be broken is a one-time pad and thats prohibitive in terms of bandwidth usage so there's no common implementation and so whilst the contents could not be broken ,the size of data would be a giveaway (key has to be 1:1 with the message).

And every proxy configuration however elaborate as noted still needs to have a packets with headers, even tor. Data still needs to be able to know where to go to and from. Key weakness of tor is you can set up honey pot servers then ddos the regular ones. Trafic goes though enough of your servers, and you get a behavioral pattern of use by the target, you start to get enough string to pull at to see where it goes. In fact, put said servers in strategic positions at major MAN network exit points from your country. Even better. 

TL;Dr aint nothing that can't be broken or side channeled.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"Thing is what you really want is to have English players exposed to the highest levels of competition regardless of what country that is in.  Its through the competition that you see improvement in player skill.

By setting a quota you aren't improving the competition you are just making it easier to for English players to play.  You don't want it to be easy to cut it in the league, you want it to be as difficult as humanly possible because that is how you improve quality. If a player (regardless of nation) can cut it in England they can cut it anywhere....that is what you want to get to.

You should be striving to have the absolute best players possible, regardless of their home nation, playing in the league and competing with English players that way when an English player rises up it is not against anything other than the absolute best talent available.

What really should be looked at is limiting squad sizes to prevent things like Chelsea buying up talent and sending it all out on loan or City buying talent and letting it rot (Rodwell, Adam Johnson, Ade, Micha Richards). Make the 25 man roster hard and fast (and include the homegrown rule), no movement. Have the ""B"" teams rosters with a bit more flexibility but still strict.

If you make the roster requirements for the first team harsh it means teams can't stockpile players that they won't play. You can only take players that will contribute to your squad on the pitch. Then the players that would be under used would have to move and teams couldn't afford to keep a player for a ransom they would have to get them off their payroll which increases the number of teams that can afford to take the players on (in England or abroad), more players playing at high level the more the players develop, more they develop the better the pool becomes for the English national team.

In the current system a cheap, experienced foreigner is more likely to get a game than an English player who is still developing. This developing talent may have to drop down a division in order to get a game, which means a lower standard of coaching and ultimately a player not reaching his early potential.

Two things, the numbers and what happens to religions over time when transplanted to different places. 

In the 2011 census Muslims were 4.8% of the population. In order to breed us out they'd have to produce an incredible amount of children as the rest of the population are also reproducing at a steady rate. Even with immigration they're not going to be even a third of the population anytime soon.

The Muslims that migrated here are by and large the more liberal elements in Islam. They don't have any problems with Western Culture that most parents don't have misgivings about from time to time. Some are even UKIP councillors. It's true that there is some fundamentalist posturing by the British born children of immigrants but if you look back at the various communities that have made the UK their home the second generations have always had a particular challenge in establishing an identity and some of them turn to a militant form of religion or politics to try to square the circle. By the time the third generation arrive they accept the British customs as a cultural norm that they are part of.

Over time religions become more liberal. Sure there are always extreme sects but these are not representative of the overwhelming majority.",0,1399573393,null,0,false,0,chcwswy,t3_24yn8x,t1_chcwswy,t1_chcvzkx,null,1433708906,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Whereas state run businesses don't care about efficiency, and will usually consume much higher ongoing funding via our taxes. Yes, more people will be employed, but is their employment actually *contributing* to the business?

The solution has to be that essential services need to be run as non-profit entities.

Don't think thats how the transition if going to go. Best equipment for it is large scale heated greenhouses. People with that sort of capacity and the scalability arn't the guy with the tin foil covered flat. It's the farmer who produces tomatoes in winter.

Don't think we should be naive about how its going to go, when it does. This stuff sells itself in this country. North to south, east to west. Day 1 is going to be industrial scale and franchise chains from the get go. Day &lt;1 is going to be angel investors carefully studying the new law.

There is no right- or left- wing political party that does not also have a strong basis in one and ONLY one of the two main religious camps.

Religion is still taken very seriously; faith is used to sway people and still to unite people using very jaded and literal readings of the Bible. Religious education in (at least the North) of Ireland is prescriptive rather than historical. All these factors lead to and facilitate the creation and perpetuation of a majority populace (or a large enough chunk) that prefer to not rock the boat and not think for themselves, just follow what has always been done and this holds back social change in the country as strong faith still walks hand in hand with social conservatism, even in a country which knows full well its own problems.",0,1399574012,null,0,false,0,chcx43o,t3_25191y,t1_chcx43o,t1_chcnyt5,null,1433709118,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

---

&gt;

&gt;__Betteridge's law of headlines__ is an [adage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adage) that states: ""Any [headline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headline) which ends in a [question mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark) can be answered by the word *no*."" It is named after Ian Betteridge, a British technology journalist,  although the general concept is much older.  The observation has also been called ""__Davis' law__""   or just the ""__journalistic principle__"". 

&gt;Betteridge explained the concept in a February 2009 article, regarding a [TechCrunch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechCrunch) article with the headline ""Did Last.fm Just Hand Over User Listening Data To the RIAA?"":

&gt;&gt;This story is a great demonstration of my maxim that any headline which ends in a question mark can be answered by the word ""no"". The reason why journalists use that style of headline is that they know the story is probably [bullshit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit), and don’t actually have the sources and facts to back it up, but still want to run it.

I always see this when people are talking about government services - i honestly don't think anyone actually thinks ""Free money"" when they get a gov't service.

I agree with the thrust of your argument, but i still think the NHS is a better system than the private healthcare in the US. When i lived in Maine (admittedly an expensive state for healthcare) i paid around $6000 a year i think? And i'm a non-smoker. 

In Britain i think the average ""premium"" - tax dollars paid to the NHS per year per person - is around $3,500. Id rather pay $1000 more in tax and $2000 less in insurance.

In the 4231, the wide players tend to play between the lines. which attracts more of a playmaker/winger hybrid type (Hazard is practically the prototypical player in this role).

2. 3 central midfielders vs 2. This is a nuanced difference, but it tends to have two important consequences. The first is that teams in a 433 shape tend to defend with a bank of four and a bank of 3, while 4231 teams tend to either defend in a 4411 shape, or with just the back six if they are a very attacking team.
