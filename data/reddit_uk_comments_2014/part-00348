A long time ago now, when we lived in our old place, Ms. Lackpot went to work super early leaving me sleeping peacefully. A little while later she comes bounding upstairs blubbing and choking and tells me she's found Sancho squashed to bits on the road as she drove to work. Now at that time we had two cats, Sancho (F) and Katie (M) - yes, I know, an unfortunate kitten-sexing accident m'kay? - and although they both belonged to both of us, we each had our favourites and Sancho was mine.

I was mortified to the point of dizziness and Ms. L said she'd scooped up the body, so I went downstairs, examined the poor black and white moggy with the crushed head and prolapsed innards and blinded by grief I wrapped her in a towel and tried to gather myself to dig a hole under her favourite plum tree. I was *really* close to those moggies and I cannot convey the depth of my grief. I buried her, went back to the house, and moped inconsolably.

Meanwhile Ms. L had abandoned the day's work and set about doing noisy housework by way of distraction. A couple of hours passed. Then, after a while, perhaps to escape the noise of the hoover, in comes Sancho, all cock of the walk like nothing's happened. I scooped her up and crying and laughing took her downstairs to show her off to Ms. L. Christonafuckingbike that was a hell of a rollercoaster.

We had to make posters and stick them to the lamposts, and later that day I had the *most* awkward phone call you can imagine and a chap from up the street came and dug the blighter up and took her home, poor sod.

Moral of the story? Generic black and white moggies can look really, really similar when their face has been crushed :-(

Dear old Sancho lived another dozen years and finally sloughed off her 9th life at the ripe old age of seventeen, at which point we once again buried her in her favourite spot in the garden, next to her brother. I still miss her.

Well, morals are fluid, they change over time. People in the 18th century probably argued that they sorted the whole capital-punishment-is-unjust moral argument by shipping criminals off to Australia. But I agree, I think it's shocking that certain communities, influenced by their regressive, twisted moral code, take it upon themselves to molest and seduce and have their way with vulnerable girls, and get away with it for decades because the police are worried about damaging inter-community relations. It's appalling that some people excise young womens clitoris in an attempt to control their sexuality and reduce their female autonomy. It's outrageous that people use religion as justification for chopping peoples heads off in broad daylight. Shocking, isn't it? Mind boggling. We sorted this out long ago, didn't we.

The people and infrastructure are all there because all the jobs and businesses are there, not the other way around. They're all either putting up with sky high rents and living costs after moving from other cities because all the jobs and businesses that they are trained for are there and the infrastructure is built to deal with all of them. Businesses aren't going there because all the people and infrastructure is there, the people and infrastructure is there because the businesses are there, and there's nothing being done to change or help that.

&gt;It's competing with New York, Paris, Frankfurt and Berlin.

Note how Frankfurt and Berlin are in the same country, that's the issue I have with this country, we've stuffed all our eggs into the same, tiny basket and we refuse to use any of the other baskets. Most major economies, some smaller than us, have multiple business centres, Germany is a perfect example. They've built the infrastructure and allowed other cities to compete which the UK doesn't do. We can, by the example of almost every major economy, have multiple business hubs. Hell, remember before september? One of the big selling points was that by leaving the UK Scotland could at least do a bit to distance ourselves from the black hole of London and set the Central belt cities up as a business hub in it's own right.

But you know what? I don't think it'll happen. The government is reluctant to do it, businesses despite everything won't do it because having a London address is a mark or prestige, and to cope with it all we'll pour trillions into London until it collapses while the other cities in the country have to make do with token company bases and futile attempts to compete with small scale BRT, tram and commuter lines whilst the country serves our bloated Lord and Master, London. Perhaps we should rename the country ""Greater London"" and cut the crap, everything's in London and it doesn't matter if it fucks the country over, that fact will only get more prominent.

They hate you,  they hate their job, and they are not there to help you (generally speaking, some of them are actually trying to help, but in general the system is designed to bend you over and have a go at it).

They can, and will ask, for multitudes of different types of evidence from you as proof. But in reality just your given word is enough as proof, but they will ask of you to fill out forms, describe your ""jobseeking process"", and assign you to third-party training courses, usually ran by their friends and / or family or the sole purpose of milking money from the country and EU. Since I cannot, in all my sound mind, fathom why would they send someone who graduated in bioinformatics to a 3 week basic math and IT course, which consisted of trivial calculations, and teaching you how to use Google. I kid you not.

Their whole purpose is to move as much paperwork around, and act busy as much as possible (by treating you like a suspect in a crime case), because that's all they can do, and if it was easier they would not have a job.

The period I was on it was without a doubt the worst period of my life. They have no sympathy, and in their eyes if you are having a rough time then you must be a failure.

They have sent my spouse back and forth from home to the Jobcentre for trivial tasks, multiple times a week, sometimes even more than once a day, even though they knew, and were repeatedly told by us over and over again, that walking, and often running (to meet their bizarre deadline and requests) is not what a disabled person needs. Surprisingly enough, my spouse is now in pre-op, waiting for a knee surgery date, despite it being recovering for a long time before Jobcentre adventures.

They have forced me to travel 2 hours by bus to a location which takes me 10 minutes by train, because they don't want to pay for it. They even admitted that because of the interview times, and my Jobcentre obligations I cannot possibly get to the job interview in time. But that was my problem, they're not paying for the train.

They have repeatedly lied to us what happens to my spouse if I sign off because of going abroad. In the Jobcentre, and via phone I was told our claim would just be converted to a single claim used by my spouse. Less money, but at least my spouse gets something. The day I signed off, and travelled off, they cancelled our JSA fully, and left my spouse with no income for the 40 days I was away, and refused the application for a new, individual claim, stating that my spouse cannot, and will not receive JSA.

They have even went so far to say that we have no JSA, and do not have to sign on anymore. Then two weeks later they send a letter that the claim has been closed because my spouse hasn't signed on the next Thursday (which was our sign on date). The sign on which they said is not existing, because we are not receiving it anymore.

They have made everything worse, and have not helped me at all. My spouse, who is generally depressive and often in bad health, has only gotten worse. Some other damages incurred by them are still present to this day, and will take some time to fix.

I have since gotten a job, as I said I'll take anything but go through that hell. I'm on a 60 hr working week, and the only reason we somehow manage is because of me doing 20hr overtime every week. But I don't care, because anything is better than JSA.

I feel for you man. I feel for everyone who has to go through that. Bite your tongue, and let them shatter your dreams, and slaughter your pride for their £60-£70 a week.

false,y3pkm8,null,null,"I'm not defending all of his actions, the choking stuff in pretty much every context I've seen I completely disagree with, but I've watched RSD for a long time and most of this controversy has been exaggerated by the media.

First of all RSD unlike other ""PUA"" content is focused largely on personal development, helping guys become better versions of themselves so they can get the girls they want. This is Julien in one of his better videos, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8vXhJLpaO0

Secondly, Julien has a pretty dark sense of humour, similar to someone like Frankie Boyle. He says and posts some fucked up things from time to time but it's what he finds funny and a lot of people who follow him also find it funny. Maybe that's wrong and people like Frankie Boyle and Julien shouldn't joke about such topics, but personally I don't really care what people say and post as long as they don't harm someone. Which is my problem with the choking stuff, even though I don't believe he was actually forcefully choking the girls, it was still wrong. And remember, if he was really that bad, don't you think someone would have taken legal action already?

If you watch his videos you'll notice although he says some stupid things to girls and encourages other guys to do the same thing he explains it needs to be done in the right context. I mean, if I walk up to a girl on the street and say, ""you dirty dog"" she'll probably be offended - and rightly so. However, if you're at a bar and you've been talking to a girl for a while and this girl is wearing a tight dress with cleavage, she might find it quite funny if you say she's a ""dirty dog"" in that context. I mean, am I the only one here who has joked about this stuff with their friends? Not to mention how girls are always calling each other sluts as a joke.

Finally, I'm sure a lot of you have seen Simple Pickup's stuff on YouTube. You'll notice Julien's ""methods"" aren't far off what they're doing. It's just Julien doesn't have a 1,000,000 fans like Simple Pickup to defend him.

There still aren't enough women doing the technical stuff.  Most women in IT are project managers and admin still.

&gt;  I know for example, I would never stand a chance in an interview against a female pentester of equal or perhaps even less calibre. Not only would she be inherently more useful in SocEng exercises, but there would be a preference for her by chauvinistic employers.

I also work in pentesting/IT security and this is actually dead on.  The girls working in this field - at least in the technical sphere - are usually dysfunctionally geeky and neckbeards love that.  I've actually found that women working in areas like software engineering are much more normal and well rounded as individuals.

Girls do well in social engineering because nobody wants to say ""no"" to a woman, and men tend to just roll over when a woman asks them to do something.

I'm trying to get out of the technical space and into management anyway.

As for condition: Make sure the bike is stone cold when you go to view it, and then try to start it. If it's already warm that can be an indicator that it has running issues which the owner is trying to hide.

Check that everything works, especially brakes, check the pads, check under the seat. Have a look for leaks on the brakes, leaks on the fork seals, the usual stuff.

As for biking in general: Once you're back on the road, why not consider either a 250cc bike, or mid-size cruiser. They may seem heavy, but all the weight is low down, and you don't feel it at all.

A 250 is a pretty good choice as they're almost as light as a 125, but have a lot more poke.

false,[deleted],null,null,"Excellent question.

If the views of the Monarch concur with mine, then that would disadvantage people who thought differently to me. So it doesn't change the fact that it's an unfair and unelected influence of some power.

That leads to nothing good; if my views get an unfair advantage, then that creates divisions and bitterness which disadvantage all of us in the long term: just as I would feel if I was opppsed to the views in question.

In addition,  the next Monarch may be  less savoury to me. Today I get an unfair advantage but tomorrow the tide may turn very nasty. And it's out of my control: unlike an election. What use is a temporary, uncontrollable advantage which may turn at any moment?

That's not an advantage: it's a liability waiting to happen.

And why lobby a bunch of MPs when it's cheaper and quicker to lobby one person whose influence is huge? It'd be like flies to a honeypot and the Monarch would be unable to go anywhere without being swamped by loonies and lobbyists. 

Which does he choose to listen to and then support? That's out of my control. ""Here, Mr Secretary to the King, have this bulging plain brown envelope. Now, if you could possibly just mention to his Highness about that thing we discussed...""

The possible ways in are endless, once the Monarch starts airing views - for those with enough cash and questionable morals.

So: much as I would enjoy hearing a Monarch air views which agreed with my own, I'd know that it was damaging our society and our democracy with every single word.

As a matter of fact, I *do* strongly suspect that The Queen's personal views are much in line with mine on quite a number of important matters: but I am still glad that she doesn't air them, for the reasons that I have given.

Chadli can be marked as a wide attacker, but it's different playing against a single fullback compared with playing as a solo striker up against two CBs.  That's the most difficult thing in today's modern game of largely lone frontmen... you either need tremendous physical attributes to overcome two defenders (Lukaku, Bony, Diego Costa, Aguero), a partner (Suarez and Sturridge for example), or frequent overlapping runs from midfield that confuse the spare CB and pull him out of position (Arsenal had a lot of luck with Ramsey performing this role last season, and Di Maria is expert at it).

Chadli is strong and tall, but he's not overly physical for his size in terms of his style of play.  His feet are pretty good, but he doesn't have great acceleration.  Adebayor on a physical level is a better fit for the role (which I think is why Poch has persisted with him so long), but obviously is in a funk.  I mean, I can't imagine Chadli doing worse up front than Ade at this point in time, but I still think that in order to really claw our way up the table, we need to make at least one of our strikers productive, whilst *also* getting goals from a midfielder, which Chadli is giving us at the moment.

Ultimately our country has grown massively wealthier per capita than we were before, when we could afford grants (at one point we were still rebuilding post-war) and so I think the argument that we can't afford it is weak, especially as we waste money elsewhere for ideological reasons like locking up non-violent drug offenders at vast expense.

Basically, you want your personal statement/profile to be very short and succinct, just one paragraph to sum up what your key skills and experience entails, and what you're looking for from your next role. The cover letter, on the other hand, lets you go into more detail. And most importantly, the cover letter is catered towards the specific job you're applying to (compared to the personal profile, which isn't). You can pick out details from your experience that you consider important in the cover letter. Honestly, I wouldn't worry about too much repetition so long as you don't just copy and paste the whole thing. 

So as an example - 

Your personal profile might give an overview saying that you're an experienced teapot maker with experience in both the manufacture and design of blue, pink, and yellow teapots, and that you're currently looking for a role in executive teapot making. 

Then let's say you apply for a job as an executive pink teapot maker. In your cover letter you can go into more detail about all of the experience you have with pink teapots, and also touch on how you believe your work with blue and yellow teapots has provided you with vital teapot colouring skills that you can bring to this new role. 

You can even get away with just two or three sentences for the personal profile, since your list of key skills and work history are usually considered more important. But then obviously you want the cover letter to span like 3 paragraphs.

&gt; The bill was only passed with a decent dent in the majority and a bigger one in the governments credibility, the Lib Dems in particular.

No, my attitude is practical based on the outcome of previous marches on the same theme. Unless AV comes into effect, the government remains safe from the relatively minor voting power of the student demographic. 

&gt; I prefer the slightly naive activism of a minority of students to the people who say they'd like something to happen/be changed/stopped but do fuck all about it.

That's up to you, but it remains naive, impotent activism. Students love to feel they're doing something worthwhile and meaningful - maybe even that they're sticking it to 'the man' - but look at what actually changed. Let's see what changes this time. 

I'm all for change - don't get me wrong - but clinging on to the hope of naive activism is not the solution. 

&gt; Tuition fees are a mess. The latest rise has ended up saving no money at all, if anything its potentially more expensive than the 3k fees. Its a completely achievable political aim to abolish them, if enough of a movement is built behind it. Look at Quebec or Germany. 

I agree tuition fees are a mess - I'm not in favour of them. That said as I said above, let's see if they're abolished any time soon. Don't get me wrong, I'll be glad if it happens and I'm wrong. 

But experience and mounting cynicism tells me that I won't be wrong. 

*Edit: And I can see I’ve upset a couple of radical student types. Consider it your wake-up call – feel free to rub it in my face IF anything changes after this new round of marches.*

*Till then, learn to love the impotency of student protesting.*

I felt quite bad when I started, because I didn't know what I was doing, especially because I am working at a company where you usually need at masters at least to be hired, and I haven't started uni yet. But remember, you are new, no one expects you to be employee of the month, and know how to do everything. 

If you have to help a customer and you don't know how to, just ask. I imagine if it is a call centre you are working in, then the best thing would be to find someone currently unoccupied, ask if they can help you. Probably transfer the customer to them, then watch and listen to how they fix it. After, ask any questions/get them to run through it with you so you know in future. 

I think it is natural to feel very overwhelmed in a new job when you have experience, so when you don't have experience it can be very daunting. Just stick with it for now, and it will get better. 

Are you leaving after December because you don't like it? Or because you have another job/education lined up? Or both? I would suggest if you are leaving because you don't like it, then you don't make any decisions now, and give it a few more weeks, see how it goes. If it still isn't for you, then you can always leave, but no one can have a go at you for not trying. 

I would also suggest you don't leave because you don't like it, without further plans. Being unemployed sucks, and I have seen many people  who have gone into depression because of it.

Say we go out there and throw a bunch of money at Karim Benzema, or take a shot on Berahino or Lacazette. Sturridge is supposed to be back available sometime in January, upon which we'll have three expensive strikers competing for a maximum of two slots, plus Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini.

In that scenario, Liverpool would have six strikers under contract come July (I know, pretty ironic given how we can't buy a goal at the moment). Origi would come into a side having to compete with Sturridge, Balotelli and Hypothetical Starting-Caliber Striker #3. Either that, or you're calling time on Mario Balotelli's Liverpool career incredibly early and have just thrown away 16 million pounds.

I say we should bring Origi in early. He's turning 20 next spring and is good enough to consistently get into the Belgium team ahead of Romelu Lukaku. We've already made the investment (paid as much for him as we did for Can, remember) and he seems to fit the profile of player that we're crying out for at the moment.

*Dear Mr ...,

I am writing to apply for the position of Office Administrator, as advertised on your website. I would love the opportunity to take on such a varied role and I think that I have the ideal skills and experience to do so; please find my CV attached for your consideration.

I am an enthusiastic young woman with excellent organisational skills, finely tuned through my years of work as PA to the Managing Director of an Events Management company. I have a great deal of relevant experience performing administrative duties, from processing orders and invoicing to franking mail and typing correspondence, often working entirely unsupervised and using my own initiative. I am also highly computer literate, with excellent typing skills and more than capable with all aspects of Microsoft Office and SAGE software.

My history within public-facing roles has developed my natural communication skills and I genuinely enjoy dealing with people, so I would be confident dealing with enquiries from your customers, both over the phone and face-to-face.

With all the relevant experience and my pro-active attitude towards work, I really do think I could become a valuable member of your team. I am available to begin work immediately and would be happy to attend an interview at most times.

Thank you in advance for your time and consideration, please see my attached CV and I hope to hear from you soon.

Best Regards,

“All schools must teach pupils about fundamental British values including mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs. That way they will be prepared for the future wherever they go.”

In short, the school was not given a lower mark because it didn't have enough ""ethnic"" students. A comment was made that the school had a lot of white-British students and that they should look to try and teach those pupils about other cultures that exist within England.

false,Thetonn,eng-sussex,Sussex,"The campaign for yes was politically negligent. They were entirely incompetent, failed at the very basics, alienated almost everyone who was not already a diehard supporter and focused so much on running what they considered a principle campaign that they misjudged what it actually was that they had to do. The result was a metropolitan, patronising circlejerk which only appealed to a small, guardian reading liberal elite which was going to support them no matter what.

The opposition, on the other hand, was also negligent. They also ran an incompetent campaign which failed at the basics and prioritised making their supporters feel good over everything else. Tories would work in one area,

The result was that the Yes Camp lead. A lot. For long periods of time the had a healthy position. To the point that Cameron and Osbourne got scared. Then all hell broke loose.

Cameron and Osbourne got all of the people together, broke down the barriers between Labour and Tory in the offices, and prioritised winning over everything else. What mattered wasn't staying true to your principles, or appeasing supporters, or winning the moral high ground. What mattered was actually convincing people to vote no.

The result? They misrepresented the truth, they were brutal to Nick Clegg, they were intellectually incoherent, they pretended to be one thing with one group of supporters and another to others. They utilised the full force of the press. They delegitimised the yes campaign as an out of touch elite only interested in their own moral superiority and political self interests. They put in a fuckload of work, time and money to the sole purpose of running the campaign, and they hired really good people to do it.

In short, they did politics. And not the crappy west wing kind, the thick of it kind.

While every possible political heavyweight was utilised effectively on the No side to their audience, Yes focused on Poets and celebrities saying how good it was. No went after the cost, Yes failed utterly to justify it. No repeated the same criticisms of AV that the yes camp had previously accepted, Yes failed utterly to give a response.

Yes entirely and completely ignored the entire right wing vote and barely made any effort whatsoever to appeal to them. They left Farage, Carswell, any right winger who supported it on the sidelines because they wanted to run a nice, fluffy, liberal, progressive campaign.

They were clueless, patronising, out of touch, incompetent arseholes. 

They lost, comprehensively, in Scotland. A country which uses more complicated voting systems to elect their parliament!

The Yes camp were worse than bad. They were atrocious. They deserved to lose on any possible matrix bar basic objective consideration.

And they still refuse to accept it.

Hello. This sounds very familiar. Firstly let me point out that gas and electric companies are not allowed to, by law, charge pay as you go customers more than people who have normal meters and pay by direct debit. However, they *are* allowed to offer non-metered customers a wider variety of deals, which inevitably means they pay less, despite what they tell you when you ask if you will pay more. 

Secondly, you say he has 'he has one of those electric ones. Likes like an over sized toaster from the 80s.' One of [these](http://www.diy.com/departments/ch-2010m-2kw-convector-heater/211665_BQ.prd)? They cost a fortune to run.

To put their running costs into context, I lived in a fucking freezing studio flat (18ft x 11 ft) and in Dec-Jan 2012-2013 that bastard thing cost me £125 in electricity. However, my flat was exposed at three sides and nobody lived above, it was a 1900s flat above a shop and so the insulation was throughly shit. Even in the summer I paid around £60 to stop the place from being arctic (no direct sun heat from windows due to other houses being close). 

I don't suppose he can do anything to reverse the landlord's decision but he'll have to be more electric savvy and wrap up/buy a less shit heater for his room.

Oh, I have just remembered the guy downstairs was paying £10 a DAY with those heaters in a slightly larger one bedroom flat. ",0,1416443888,null,0,false,0,cm7ifzy,t3_2msapi,t1_cm7ifzy,t1_cm76a1l,null,1425939904,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

Probably just this. [An ofsted inspection last year found](http://www.marketrasenmail.co.uk/news/education/education-news/primary-schools-told-they-must-improve-1-4851428):

&gt; Ofsted inspectors have told two of the area’s primary schools they ‘require improvement’ and pupils’ progress is not good enough.
&gt; 
&gt; Middle Rasen Primary School and Nettleton Primary School have both been given a ‘requires improvement’ rating after visits from Ofsted inspectors.
&gt; 
&gt; **Inspectors said Middle Rasen Primary School pupils had “inconsistent” progress in maths and there was sometimes “insufficient” emphasis on the importance of spelling and presentation of work.**
&gt; 
&gt; **The report said leadership - including the governing  body - did not make sure pupils made consistently good progress.**
&gt; 
&gt; The school was praised for its teaching of reading skills, creative development, attendance and good behaviour.
&gt; 
&gt; Middle Rasen Primary School headteacher Melonie Brunton said: “We’ve taken on board the comments made by Ofsted - excellent attendance, good behaviour and good progress in reading - and have been working really hard with governors and the authority to address the other issues raised.
&gt; 
&gt; “We’re now looking forward to the HMI (Her Majesty’s Inspectorate) visit when we can show the progress made since December.”

Everyone likes to think they're out to get you (maybe some are), but in reality it is incredibly easy to meet the requirements they set on you.  Apply for a few jobs (or not -they won't know the difference- but you might as well), name a few well-known job search websites.  Repeat in two weeks.  If you're on it long term they will probably require you to apply for a particular number of jobs per two weeks, but that doesn't really change anything.

As proof, either fill in the sheet they give you, or record what you do on Universal Jobmatch.  There's a box on the Activity History page where you can save notes.  That's your proof.  You don't need to produce any documentation beyond that, but anything extra certainly won't hurt and may make them more sympathetic.  Printed emails from/to prospective employers, that kind of thing.

false,lithaborn,eng-westmidlands,West Midlands,"I've recently gone from JSA back to ESA after failing one medical and having to go through their stupid preocesses....anyway...

At my initial interview I flat out told them that not even professional job hunters (agencies and the like) did 35 hours job seeking a week and they just kept spouting the party line that I should look at it like a fulltime job, etc. I told them straight that the people who claimed they actually completed 35 hours were lying and their reply was ""well, we can't prove that, so we don't care"".

I see from other replies that you know about the UJ comments section. This is how I beat them: Hammer that fucking comments box.

Have a list of five or six legit jobseeking activities you can talk about - let's say:

Travelling around town handing out spec CV's

Joining sites like Monster and setting up email alerts

Getting the local paper on Sits Vac days

Contacting old colleagues

Looking into self employment

updating your CV

getting spec calls from agencies

The ones you can focus on are the email alerts and handing out spec CV's. Have six or seven local towns in mind, get to know what shops are there, cafe's, mobile phone stores, branches of boots, wilkinson, greggs, you name it...and hammer out a note on how you visited the place and handed out x amount of CV's that day. You can pull that one twice, three times a week. Five CV's is good for a three or four hour trip, travel allowing. That's 12 hours, right there.

Email alerts is good for an easy half hour per application, because normally you'll have to sign up for a new site every time you apply, and that includes uploading CV's, writing cover letters, setting up email alerts on that new site, waiting for authentication, etc, etc. 

Milk it and know your story well before you get questioned. Keep your answers and explanations simple. The easier they are to remember, the less you're likely to forget. A lot of sites don't give you contact details, just a reference number, so if they want names and numbers, just say that site doesn't give that information.

Aim to make them have to plough through at least four or five pages of notes when they look at your UJ account. Ain't nobody got the time to check and quiz you about all that, and you'll look like you're overachieving, which they'll be happy about.

Pad out your UJ application log by applying for a ton of jobs just above your level, you know, stuff you've no hope of getting...or plough through all the crappy, obviously fake jobs that redirect you to dodgy third party sites. make a comment with the ref number and say you applied. They won't check because they know it's a bullshit application to a bullshit company but can't admit that to you.

You're allowed a day off and despite what they say, you don't have to strictly do 35 hours a week. The agreement, unless it's changed in the three weeks since my last signing day, says ""do as much as you can"". 

Hammer that comments box and make it *look like* you're doing as much as you can, lead the conversation when you go to sign on and complain about how the jobs don't update fast enough on sites, and how you've been walking all around town for so long and you thought everyone was hiring in the run-up to xmas and what the hell, because you've still not heard anything...

One of my favourites was to spot staff-facing vacancy notices laying around or taped to the wall, take an interest when you sit down to sign on, then get all slumpy when they say ""Oh I can't put you forward for that because...""

Ask them about training courses and CV workshops and, well just shit to occupy your time, satisfy their requirements and for you to socialise a bit with likeminded doley layabouts you can have a good bitch with.

And yet you (and/or others like you) voted against it. Thanks for that mate.

The worst thing about it is that the upcoming election is a perfect example of a situation in which AV is *clearly* better than first past the post: the Tories have fucked the NHS and the working class, Labour have no leadership whatsoever, and Clegg can't be trusted after his broken promises, so now more than ever the country is full of people that are desperate to vote for the Greens etc. Frankly we'll probably get a Labour/Lib Dem coalition in power regardless of what voting system we use, but it would've been nice to have a few extra Green Party seats and the like (cough UKIP cough).

Well, the ""ride"" was about 15 minutes maybe longer and the museum spans two floors. I'd say you can spend at most a couple of hours in the whole experience taking it with no hurry at all.

&gt;touchable props

Stritcly no touching the exhibits and the rooms are supervised at all times! There were however a couple of things that were interactive such as an half Dalek shell and a panel to try out for yourself the Dalek and Cybermen voice filters. 
&gt;non-rushed tours 

I went there first thing a wednesday afternoon IIRC and the tour was full for 3/4
&gt;cafe, restaurant and smoking areas

Very good facilites but I didn't get anything. Great souvenir shop though!
&gt;not too busy, and all around enjoyable experience.

The two floors of the exposition are quite large and there really needs to be a lot of people to feel crowded. 

It depends on what you are looking for and what kind of a fan are you but for any whovian it's a delightful experience and seeing the original props (TARDISes, Daleks, Cybermen and gadgets) is well worth the price of admission.

We were very lucky last season that the two players we relied on immensely - Sturridge and Suarez - were never both out of action at the same time. Both had extended absences, but each was available and in form to cover for the other.

This season:

* we sold one of them.
* we have many more games to play.
* we couldn't hope to be as lucky as last season.

To have any hope of challenging for the title and making a good fist of the Champion's League, we needed to sign multiple players who were capable of making a contribution this season, with any promising young players 'for the future' a bonus.

We absolutely needed:

1. a creative influence to replace Suarez (obviously it wouldn't be somebody quite *that* good, but if we lose a major star we need to bring one in).
2. one or two strikers with a similar skill set to Studge to play when he doesn't, either through injury or rotation. Also as options from the bench.
3. an extra body with a physical presence in midfield (because we were fucked when Hendo was suspended).
4. one or two creative midfielders so that Coutinho and Sterling don't have such a heavy burden, and so that Rodgers would have options from the bench.

What did we get?

1. nope
2. nope - we got Lambert and Balotelli who each provide something different for Rodgers to consider, but we would have to change entirely the way the team plays to make use of them.
3. It's asking a lot of Can to fulfil this at his age and in a new league, but I actually think we'll see rapid improvement after his recent positive performances.
4. We've got Lallana who is taking a while to settle but I think will go on to do what we need from him. Markovic is not up to speed: he's an investment in the future but will only play a bit part in the present.

I like the new lads in the full-back positions; I like most of the summer signings. Balotelli and Lambert are the two I'd highlight as money poorly spent - Balotelli's a wonderful player in a team that plays to his strengths, but the pressing and countering that served us well last season isn't his game. And the fact that Lambert can't even get a start when we're this desperate suggests that he never will, so why sign him? We've done these lads no favours at all by bringing them in and then not playing to their strengths.",0,1416449941,null,0,false,0,cm7lgkv,t3_2mtxp9,t1_cm7lgkv,t3_2mtxp9,null,1425937832,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

Every other player was, theoretically, an improvement on existing options in some way. **Moreno** is a better left-back than Enrique - he'll also go on to get better, so great. **Lovren** was widely considered an upgrade in terms of leadership and willingness to defend proactively. **Lallana** is an upgrade on - well, nobody, since we had fuck all in the way of alternative attacking options last season beyond the starting eleven. Similarly, **Can** is better than our existing squad option of nobody, and looks like an upgrade on Allen given his added physicality. **Lambert** wasn't a sentimental signing, he was a good plan B who's been made redundant because we then bought another plan-B-type striker in **Balotelli** when we needed a plan-A-type striker (someone like Remy and Sanchez, who we went after). 

3 'for the future' players, with one on loan at another club, is reasonable. You'd expect the non-future players to take up the slack until the future players have settled and developed. Unfortunately, it's not a universal truth that older players settle quicker at a club than younger players, and guys like Lovren haven't settled, while Can and Lallana have been injured. Add in prolonged injury to our most important player, and our one huge transfer error in inadequately buying his backup (Balotelli being the wrong type of striker for our midfield to supply, much like replacing Torres with Carroll), and you explain our situation today.

It also doesn't help that the £100M we spent is more like £25M this FY and the net stuff is pretty irrelevant anyway.

Short version is we could have nothing to spend or quite a lot, it's all just educated guesses really based on at this point quite old data so you may well be correct.

I don't think FSG have any intention of selling though as I don't know that they'd get a bid big enough to make them consider it.  If they did get a big enough one they probably would though as I think they've spent a lot more than they expected to.  Also don't disagree that they'd be reluctant to give the committee/BR any more money, as I wouldn't either.

I've known about him for a while. A few people I know have even been to his seminars. I've personally been against his material for a long time because I think it's way too aggressive and sometimes mean.

The stuff he did with the Japanese women is pretty fucked up in my opinion. When that video was uploaded originally I was telling one of my friends who went to his seminar that he went way too far and even he was agreeing with me.

After watching most of his videos I'm almost certain that he was just trying to be funny in that video. He posts a lot of shit like that for laughs like Frankie Boyle, people who follow him understand his humor but people who don't obviously don't get it.

I'm saying this because I know in his seminars he explains a lot that he only does physical or risky things when he knows the girl will be okay with it. I mean these things aren't always necessarily wrong. For example, I met a girl one night in a club, we started making out and I held her against the wall for a bit while we were making out. She thought it was funny and even started trying to hold me against the wall after ""to get me back"". We were both cool with it and had a laugh. However, the problem is these girls obviously weren't okay with it so he shouldn't have done it. I think he was thinking, ""well they're not saying no so it's okay and this will be funny to post"". But he wasn't clear in his video that he was joking so obviously it looks awful and it appears like he's teaching guys to do this stuff.

I guess what annoys me is how people are making out he's a rapist and that he was forcefully choking women or something. That's just complete shit.

We wanted Moreno all summer, and eventually we got him. Just because we signed him so late doesn't mean Lallana was a *more important* buy; the deals happen when they happen. I also don't think changing the timeline would've made a change in who we bought - any players we were priced out of, we would've been priced out of at any point in the window (Cavani and Falcao, for example), because it's not just about transfer fee, but about the club's wage structure and FSG's philosophy around that (which seems to be pretty conservative, of not bringing players in on big contracts but letting them earn big contracts by performing here).

For me, the 3 positions in the first XI needing strengthening were a LB, a 'Suarez replacement' which I saw as a goalscoring wide man who could play up front if needed (since Rodgers wants to play 1 up top), and a CB. We got the LB and the CB, but the latter hasn't been the improvement anticipated. We went after 2 players perfectly suited to 'replace Suarez' (Sanchez, Remy), and failed to get them through for differing reasons. We then fucked up by buying a player of a 'name'/'profile' rather than of the right type, and the way injuries have fallen, that single fuck up is costing us dearly.

Gerrard at CDM wasn't going to change because, like it or not, Gerrard is somewhat undroppable at Liverpool, in the way Ramos and Casillas are untouchable at Madrid, or the way Cole, Lampard and Terry were untouchable at Chelsea under AVB. That's fine, if you set up to maximise Gerrard's strengths at CDM and minimise his weaknesses:

- The rest of the midfield and attack pressing from the front, with 2 energetic, mobile CM's ahead of Gerrard.

- A high defensive line, minimising the space Gerrard has to cover

- High-tempo counterattacking football, because I don't think there's a better player in the league right now when it comes to turning defence to attack in the blink of an eye from such a deep position.

We replaced a 31 goal striker with a guy for £16M who has scored 13 goals in 2 seasons from open play, a 32 year old, and a kid we had to leave out on loan.  This makes no sense at all really.

I think we agree here, but for me BR's concept was to shift back to more of a 4-3-3 system, thus he brought in 'big signings' of Lallana and Markovic (£15M more than we spent on strikers, which makes no sense if the idea is to play with two up front) to be wingers/wide forwards.  Fair enough, I guess, but this is markedly different to the style of play we had last year with pressing/pace and shows a shift back to his initial mentality and how he setup Swansea, which I'm not necessarily a big fan of, and I don't think either Lallana or Markovic are strong enough goal scorers from wide areas for this to really work well particularly without a quality striker in the middle running the channels and helping set up play for others.  It also is a tad ironic to me that I don't think BR had any intention of playing 2 up top regularly regardless of how much everyone is screaming for it now.

With respect to the rest:

- Gerrard shouldn't be our CDM.  Love the guy and he still has a role to play, but it shouldn't be there.  Let him do what he's always done as one of the best attacking midfielders to have played the game, even if it's for limited minutes.  A very good CDM should have been a priority and BR as manager he simply has to make that call.

- Mignolet I like okay and he's not bad, but something has to change or he needs to improve a lot.  At the very least, sack Achterberg and get a different keeper coach in to see if that works.

- There was nothing wrong with our CBs for me.  Sakho + Agger and Skrtel + Toure with Ilori providing add'l cover is not a bad back 5 at all.  I don't have an issue with Lovren, I just don't think he was a necessary buy versus the other areas of weakness.

- LB was an obvious weak point.  Moreno in, problem sorted, and a good acquisition.

I don't think the 4-3-3 has to be a departure from the pace/pressing; counter-attacking was a big component of Swansea's success under Rodgers (Scott Sinclair and Nathan Dyer especially), and two of our most glorious wins last season (Arsenal and Everton at Anfield) were achieved with a 4-3-3.

Oh please, rape cases aren't based on these. The vast majority of the time, it's the difficulty of getting concrete evidence that intercourse happened and then proving it was non-consensual. It is the correct approach of innocent until proven guilty combined with the difficulty of proof that gives the low rate of conviction of rape.

Years ago, a family friend of ours was living at my house. She went out for the night and got raped. The police came and took samples and the like but nothing eventually came of it due to lack of evidence. To their perspective it was just a drunk girl willingly going somewhere with someone and then having sex. Proving that it was rape wasn't possible with the circumstances of the case, as it is with most cases.

Lallana was TOTY last season. How quickly people forget. We might have overpaid a bit for him, but we wanted to buy more than they wanted to sell, plus we were adding an English presence to a squad with lots of young English (hopefully future legends).

To reply to your original stuff, we had to expand our squad to something that could challenge 4 competitions rather than 1. United and Arsenal have been able to keep the large squad size for the last 4 years that we've been out of the CL.They can add quality without adding depth. In the summer everyone on this sub was saying Ian Ayre was amazing because of our business. Now everyone has hindsight. We tried to get established talent, they all turned us down. Who could we have got? Not everyone we signed will be a success, but we've not signed badly. Someone who scored 13 goals in 37 games the season before for a good team and is delighted to be a reserve striker, two fullbacks who are straight into the first team and could be with us for a decade, that TOTY Lallana (established talent) and three players who aren't good enough so far this season (Mario, Markovic (who's 20 and not had many chances) and Lovren). But even if none of those three come good (and I bet at least one will) that's not a bad return. Not every transfer is a success.

They are an artificial cost decided by politicians. It's a political, not economic cost. Many universities say that they want to charge £6,000 but are scared to because they will lose the social prestige brought about by charging the full amount. Similarly, if the Government raised the tuition fee cap further, which it claims it may do after the next election, the cost of university education will have raised but won't be any more of an expensive good in a material sense.

Also, when you ask
&gt;which tax do you want to raise to pay for it?

the answer is none. Who pays the universities the tuition fees at the moment? Not the student, but the Government based on a loan and the hope of recuperating significant portions of it back by effectively taxing parts of the income of graduates. Reverting to student grants would have **no effect** on the budget deficit or levels of present taxation. Claiming otherwise is a disingenuous lie, when in the present it would be paid for in the same way that it is now.

false,p7r,uk,United Kingdom,"Green Park is *always* busy, at 10pm on a Tuesday it's busy, at 6am on a Wednesday it's busy, at 2pm on a Sunday it's busy, but that is insane. One of the problems is that it's a relatively old/small station in some ways but is a key interchange - Piccadilly, Jubilee and Victoria lines meet there. So it's serving people doing West London &lt;-&gt; Westminster/Docklands, South London &lt;-&gt; Rest of London and North London &lt;-&gt; Rest of London.

If there was more North/South capacity elsewhere and more tubes South of the river, there would be less stress there, but instead we're building more East/West capacity and giving South Londoners a big ""sucks to be you"" middle finger.

In fairness, last night I got an email from TfL apologising for the tube yesterday, it had got that stupid. District and Piccadilly lines were both part suspended for periods in rush hour, and that's the 2nd time in a week. 

It's to be expected in some ways: the weather has turned and it's got wet, so the ancient signalling systems are going to be stressed for the first time in months. I know I'm leaving 45 minutes earlier at the moment.

That photo is bad for Green Park, but I've actually seen worse at Kings X which on the Northern line has a slightly narrower platform. The Friday before the August bank holiday, it was like ""pro-mode commuting"" down there in rush hour, and I saw one grown man in tears trying to get ""excuse me"" out through his tears. I wanted to help him, but was in the flow going the other way and just sort of got carried - you know how it is.

Also, the Northern line is now so bad I tend to get District and then move to a bus rather than take the quicker Piccadilly/Northern route in the mornings (I'm doing Barons Court -&gt; Old Street), and even that is starting to get intolerably miserable. New trains on the District starting in January will help - they ran one the other evening and the difference was noticeable - but it does seem that in the last 2 years since I moved down here there's an extra 10%-20% more people on my commuting routes.

I think in the New Year we could start to look at moving out to an area with a reliable train service into London Bridge, Liverpool Street, etc. (ha!), but realistically the plan has to be to get the hell out within a couple of years.",0,1416465715,null,0,false,0,cm7rysi,t3_2mr8v1,t1_cm7rysi,t3_2mr8v1,null,1425934726,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

There were outright lies and misinformation being spread by the No Campaign that had legitimacy as they were backed by all major parties. 

What's worse is the Yes Campaign were terrible at calling them on it, and educating the public on how much of an improvement it is over FPTP. They let them get away with the bullshit they spewed.

You've then got the fact that people were arguing ""well AV isn't as good as PR, or STV, or &lt;insert your preferred improved choice&gt;"". Which is fair enough, each system has it's benefits and drawbacks, but at the same time, we weren't voting for another system, we were voting for AV or FPTP, and AV is far better than FPTP.

To not take that upgrade from FPTP to AV, because it wasn't quite a big enough step, even though it was the only step we'll get offered for a generation is selfish and stupid. It would have been easier to then transition into a more PR based electoral system from AV, than it is from FPTP.

Not only that, but I haven't seen a single person who jumped on the ""AV isn't a big enough improvement"" bandwagon, calling for further reform since that vote failed.

Imagine you're looking to buy a new car. You currently have a clapped out 1996 Daewoo Matiz, that costs you £60/week in petrol and brakes down every month. You're desperate for something new, but the bank won't give you a loan to upgrade.

Now, luckily for you, a generous relative comes along and offers you a nice, 2014 VW Golf. It's got great fuel efficiency, really reliable and a considerable upgrade from your Daewoo Matiz. But you turn him down because deep down it's not the 6.3l V12 LaFerrari you've wanted since you read about it a few weeks ago. 

So, you return to driving your embarrassing Matiz to work and back every day, hating the fact that it still brakes down, and still costs you more on insurance and tax in the long run.

Rather than making that smaller jump from a Daewoo to a VW, you chose to stick with the Daewoo because you weren't offered a Ferrari. You take comfort in the fact that deep down, you're still holding out for winning the lottery to get that Ferrari, but in reality, it will never happen.

The move from the Daewoo to the VW is a nice, considerable improvement, much like the move from FPTP to AV, but in the grand scheme of things, it's not anywhere near as nice as the jump from the Daewoo to the LaFerrari, much like FPTP to a full PR system, but that doesn't mean you weren't silly to turn down the offer.",0,1416466342,null,0,1416479089,0,cm7s542,t3_2mt35m,t1_cm7s542,t1_cm7hayr,null,1425934646,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

She apparently really disliked Gladstone personally, and even before he became PM she spoke out very publicly against him when he suggested full male suffrage. She also made Lord Palmerston very clear that she disapproved of his government's foreign policy in terms of its possibility of destabilising European monarchies.

Edward VII's last couple of years were spent in complete constitutional turmoil as the Commons finally asserted its authority over the Lords (and hence the monarch) and apparently it was well-known that the King was very unhappy with the situation.

Edward VIII is probably the most interesting of all. His political views are very well known and of course even after his abdication Hitler planned to reinstate him as King if the conquest of Britain had been successful. Given how wilful Edward obviously was (enough to stand up to enormous peer pressure over Mrs Simpson) I'd have been amazed, given the political situation in Europe in the late 1930s, if he wouldn't have been an extremely outspoken monarch had his reign lasted.

I can't find anything to suggest either of the 20th-century Georges were particularly outspoken. In fact I believe that the Queen takes her strictly non-political stance directly from her father's beliefs.

&gt;

&gt;__St. Catherine's Oratory__ is a [medieval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval) [lighthouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighthouse) on [St. Catherine's Down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Catherine%27s_Down) near the southern coast of the [Isle of Wight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Wight), the [Back of the Wight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_of_the_Wight). It was built by Lord of [Chale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chale) Walter de Godeton (sometimes spelled ""Goditon"") as an act of penance for plundering wine from the wreck of St. Marie of [Bayonne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayonne) in Chale Bay on April 20, 1313 [AD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AD).  The lighthouse tower is known locally as the ""Pepperpot"".

&gt;The lighthouse is a stone structure 4 stories high. It is octagonal on the outside and four-sided on the inside. It originally was on the west side of an adjacent building. The remnants of three other walls are visible at the site. 

&gt;de Godeton was put on trial in [Southampton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southampton) before an Island jury for the theft of the wine, and fined 287.5 marks on February 27, 1314. However, de Godeton was also tried for the theft in Church courts as well, since the wine was headed for the monastery of Livers in [Picardy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picardy). The Church threatened to excommunicate de Godeton unless he built a lighthouse near Chale Bay.

David Cameron was urged to wear a shirt saying ""this is what a feminist looks like"". He refused. He didn't want to be associated with the label. He's spoken frequently about equality. But to a significant number of his supporters, the word itself is toxic.

Time magazine had an article suggesting that ""feminist"" was a word that should be banned in 2015. They later said this was a mistake, but there's a reason it was there in the first place.

Taylor Swift, when asked if she was a feminist skirted the question.

Most young girls don't identify as feminists. They see it as meaning man-hating. A lot of people who don't see it that way realise that even if they don't, other people do, and focussing on the issues is a lot more important than the labels we apply.

Monarchy is a total anachronism in a world that's supposed to be about equality (hahahaha) but is it any worse than what we have now? (Daily Mail Democracy)

Having a leader who was literally born for the job, educated to highest standards, has *generations* of experience of power, commands universal respect around the world and is (hopefully) motivated by  honour, duty and doing their best for the UK. 

Take a look at what the Royal family actually spend their time doing ... negotiating trade deals, meeting with foreign VIPs etc. 

I'm not suggesting a return to a full monarchy at all, but I'd be interested in what Charles (and subsequently William) has to say.

[What has happened to Alice?](http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/jul/23/luther-recap-season-three-episode-four)

&gt; She might have started the series as Hannibal Lecter, but she finished it as Frankie Howerd. Once the obligatory terrifying introduction – setting off a stun grenade and storming on in a gas mask – was over, Ruth Wilson promptly went about gnawing on every single piece of scenery within a 50-ft radius. Dressed like Emma Peel, driving a terribly inefficient-looking vintage sports car and spouting anecdote after frothing anecdote about her spurious adventures in Berlin, this was a very different Alice to the one we met killing her parents all those years ago.

Speaking of Ruth Wilson, she's acting very well in the Affair. Together with Dominic West, it's also worth watching.

She's also playing in an upcoming Broadway show *Constellations* with Jake Gyllenhaal.

false,PsyAndSnoop,,armchair revolutionary,"""Forced multiculturalism"" is a reality mate, we live in a multicultural country and even if you grow up in a whitebread part there's a chance in the future that the demographic mix could change or that you could be forced to moved to a more ethnically diverse area in pursuit of a job. Being isolated and segregated is no longer an option, and the irony I find is that it is precisely out of touch little  Englanders who worry about races segregating into their ghettos when in reality they just don't want a 'foreign' family moving in next to them. They fear people of different cultures precisely because they don't know them, and introducing them to other cultures helps to erase this prejudice and is essential if the school itself cannot provide an environment where children can mix with chidren from other backgrounds.

Your second para is essentially nonsense, this doesn't replace any lessons and is supplementary to the curriculum, ensuring children are raised to be well rounded individuals who understand the nature of modern British society. Of course a school which is already ethnically  diverse doesn't have to do this, they will have their own challenges and concerns anyway. For example a school in inner London may have to contend with many children who don't speak English at home, whereas this school in Lincolnshire won't have that problem. Instead it has to focus some time on ensuring children understand that the UK, the nation to which we all belong, isn't all like Lincolnshire and they should be exposed to other cultures and encouraged to meet and interact with children from other backgrounds. Of course schools have a role in the socialisation of our children, for the same reason we have religious assemblies and extracurricular activities and sports.

Absolute Prices dipped in 2008-9 but no one bought/sold.  Then they stabilized.  Now they are up on average 7k over the same total period.

In the same period, the prices went from 4.5x earnings to 5.0.

So people owning houses did vastly better than people working for a living.

[In 2007 the average rate for a variable mortgage was 7%, now it is 2.5%](http://www.housepricecrash.co.uk/graphs-base-rate-uk.php).  So the interest payment  on peoples mortgages has dropped by 66%.  For someone with a big mortgage, about half of the payment is interest.

So that's a 33% cut in mortgage payments with no hit on the equity being accrued and a 4% bump in prices.

That's pretty fucking juicy if you ask me.  No other social group has been given 7k by the government and had their expenses dropped by 33% over the same period.  Even pensioners.

Stay calm. No matter what allegation is made, **stay calm**. Asking questions is very useful. For example:

* OK, I can see this thing happened. I am confused as to why I am here, since I wasn't at work at the time, and it wasn't my shift. Can you clarify why I am here?

* OK, so can you clarify what I could have done differently?

* OK, so can you clarify how I would have done that, not being on site?

You can get these in even if they pile straight in: ""OK, before I answer that, can you just explain....""

Questions about process are also useful.

* This is the first instance of this, to my knowledge. Can you clarify what the disciplinary process is? Why are we having a hearing after the first instance rather than some informal verbal guidance from my boss? 

Better yet, have a think about the questions over the weekend, and send them *in writing* to the HR dept first thing on Monday. CC in your own personal email. 

Ask for a full copy of all the procedures too: on Friday, so you can study them over the weekend and let them guide your questions while quoting the process back at them, with section numbers.

As to process: *get a record of everything*. Make sure the meeting is minuted and/or record it. Immediately afterwards (or when you've calmed down), send an email summarising your view of the discussion *in a neutral tone* and what facts emerged. This email is not the time to argue; it is time to document what happened.

If they do not reply, that can be taken as agreement. If they do reply, and disagree with what you wrote, then it is time to get a further clarification: in writing. Refuse a verbal option at this point, because clearly the verbal option didn't lead to clarity last time. If they insist on a verbal meting, do the same thing again afterwards.

I did Physics - a research focused degree and to be honest the research didn't even come into it until the final year - until then I was just paying a lot for the 'University experience' and quite frankly there are cheaper ways of getting drunk.

I could be biased as my work was all computational and I subsequently studied Computer science so I understand that's easier to innovate but I think the OU has done very well and should be a model for future development.

Not nationally it seems, but here in Bristol anyway. They claimed they were having issue with people buying stuff then saying it hadn't arrived, to get a 'free' replacement (to sell?) or a refund, apparently Bristol was a black-spot for this so they quit using RM and now only deliver via Yodel, that way you have to sign for delivery, fair enough.

I wouldn't have noticed, a book through the post is a book through the post no matter what colour the van that delivers it is, but Yodel are a problem.

I had one delivery of one book turn into a five week farce of it being delivered to a vacant house with a similar address, twice, and both times I had allegedly signed for it even though neither myself, or anyone, live in the property. I finally worked it all out after collaring a Yodel driver in the act after waiting in all day, and after the weirdest dystopian future back-and-forth with the Amazon automated website 'customer service' reps. 

They'd sent me two books, they had delivered both to the wrong (vacant) house, they claimed I'd signed for both and now they want BOTH returned after I'd got the estate agents out to open the door and retrieve them for me. I sent one back, one was mine, paid for. They still wanted both. I gave up and deleted my card from my account and deleted that bookmark.

I now use Waterstones, it's about the same price, the book is delivered to the store, I get an email and pick it up. No waiting in for Yodel's vague promise of delivery, no delivery to empty houses, no rain-soaked parcels, no parcels put in my bin, and most importantly no stress.

Fuck Amazon now, they lost me.

That's not my take on it. QE happened because the banks weren't lending enough money and the economy was tightening up as a result.

* The Bank of England uses QE money to buy up gilts from banks and other financial institutions.
* This is supposed to improve liquidity within the financial sector, meaning banks will start lending money again.
* However, it's mainly been used to increase banks' reserves (part of the new banking regulations to ensure no one is 'too big to fail'). It's also done little to stop banks focusing on highly profitable risky behaviour – or any of the illegal activities like forex manipulation.

House prices: it's partly a question of supply, partly money being thrown into the housing market because investors think it's a safe bet – which isn't a surprise when the government's tried its best to prop up house prices with Help to Buy and encouraging buy-to-let.

My interpretation is the banks are lending lots of money – but mainly to sectors outside the 'real' economy.",0,1416475809,null,0,1416480386,0,cm7u8mj,t3_2mv19e,t1_cm7u8mj,t1_cm7u38g,null,1425933168,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

And the system was engineered toward getting that bit of paper.

When I was at university there were a number of people who were there because they were told to go, not because they'd really decided if it was best for them.

&gt;No. We will not negotiate existing levels of protection for the sake of an agreement.  Our high level of protection here in Europe is non-negotiable.  But let us not forget that the US also takes protection of its citizens very seriously.  Both the EU and the US are committed to high levels of protection for our citizens, but we go about it in different ways.  The EU sometimes relies more on regulations, the US more on litigation.  Both approaches can be effective, but neither is perfect.  There is room to learn from each other. 

&gt;This is not a race to the bottom.  Making our regulations more compatible does not mean going for the lowest common denominator, but rather seeing where we diverge unnecessarily.  There will be no compromise whatsoever on safety, consumer protection or the environment.  But there will be a willingness to look pragmatically on whether we can do things better and in a more coordinated fashion.

I think you would be hard pressed to find any way to justify the way we treat animals as a society. Maybe you can argue that individuals find it to hard to be vegan (I'm only veggie at the moment), but as a whole civilization it's plain wrong.

Ecologically the argument is dead simple, we need to eat much less meat, if not stop all together.

Morally it is problematic at most. 

If you accept any kind of utilitarian morality then the ecological unsustainable nature of eating animals completely destroys the position.

If you go on some kind of principle based morality, like Kant's categorical imperative idea and whatnot then I think you run into problems as well. It's just too hard to draw a line between when it is okay to treat the mammals we raise for food so inhumanely and when it is not okay to treat humans badly. Does a person with massive learning difficulties / development problems have more or less rights that a super smart chimp? What if the chimp is better able to demonstrate consciousness and thought?

I never said it was, I used it more as a literary device before going into my own personal experience.  Then after that I put two links which had subjective analysis showing that dropping the tax rate resulted in more money received.

Economics is a bit like saying *It looks a bit like this* it's a representation nothing more.  The laffer curve is simplistic, because it doesn't take into account localities around the curve, differences in peoples lives (ie having dependants vs not).

&gt;I cannot really fathom that being taxed at 80% on your 5th million pound paycheck is going to really affect your quality of life

Because why are you being paid that in the first place?  I've you've already earned 4 million quid, you might think, fuck this, and do nothing.  This is one of the issues of higher taxation, the more likely outcome, for someone of that income, would be that they would simply avoid paying the tax.  How nice really is the UK?  How much of your life do you really need to be here?  Non-dom time...

&gt;It might make you rethink about paying yourself more and more handsomely rather than putting the money into something like R&amp;D and other peoples salaries though.

You conflate the two issues.  People don't pay more into R&amp;D, if they thought it would yield results, they would already be investing that money, or they don't have that money to spend.

Also you have this odd notion that one persons remuneration effects the others more strongly than it does.  Rather it does in any company I've worked for or owned.  You have to pay staff enough that they want to work for you, out bidding the competition, but lower than their productive value benefits the firm.  That's it. If one of my last bosses took a £5M paycut, I wouldn't be paid a penny more.  The value of the work I was doing was already comfortably 50 times my cost, the reason they were only paying me X, is they could find someone else to do it for X too.

&gt;Regardless of actual mechanics of the situation, what do you think the ideal is then?

I'm not professing to know the answer to that question.  More that from my own experience, keeping 32% of a days work, after costs and the like resulted in about 24%, my margins were pretty good.  I couldn't face doing it.  I couldn't drag myself to do that work for so little reward, my tastes in life are modest enough, a small little flat in zone 4, an economic cheap car, no real designer clothes etc.  Why bother with it?  Why bother working that hard at all?  Why not just work half a year?  So all I can say is for me, it has to be lower.  50% is still too high for me, there is psychological/emotional thing about half.

All we do know, from objective data, is that the 50p rate was a failure, and was just a political play by the labour party.",0,1416482612,null,0,false,0,cm7ve95,t3_2mv2xk,t1_cm7ve95,t1_cm7v2sl,null,1425932543,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

BT would or should not be able to obtain a certificate for *.google.com as they don't own that domain name, and browsers these days are likely to use certificate pinning to avoid man in the middle attacks or interception so would throw up a warning if BT somehow got its own certificate.

So by getting Google to disable SSL, the connection can be redirected from HTTPS to HTTP which then allows BT to intercept it to display their login page without the browser going haywire.

I have no idea if there's a better way that this could be done that would let Google keep SSL enabled. Maybe at the minimum, provide an ""turn SSL back on"" link on that message and explain that this is done on some networks for this reason?

In this case Google would be the exception as a lot of people start their browsing session by using google.com, especially if they think their internet is broken and they want to test it. That's what I do anyway.

You're entitled to a certain level of holiday every year, but employers are allowed to include bank holidays and things. So they could say, for example ""21 days holiday + public holidays"" and they would meet the requirement. Or they could say 31 days (or whatever it is). 

If it's the former then Christmas is a public holiday and you're entitled to be paid for it, even if the shop is closed. If it's the latter, then there's no requirement to allow you to have Christmas Day off.

Likewise if you're required in your contract to work X hours per week, and they aren't open on say a Wednesday, you still need to work X hours.

But then the flipside to that coin is maybe this was Rassilon's plan and Missy was just the Executor. Maybe they realized that The Doctor would never willingly let the Time War start again, and he likely still has The Moment squirreled away somewhere after using it.

So instead they attempted to give the Doctor an Army that he could go to war with. Have him utilize that army to wipe out the Dalek's forever and then allow the Time Lords to re-enter into the universe without threat of causing another Time War.

Using Missy made sense in that she is the only Time Lord outside of the Doctor who could legitimately not be on Gallifrey without causing any major issues.

It's far too risky wasting a larger portion of the annual budget on one or two shows that might not succeed, especially when the original American version is probably already airing on a UK channel anyway. Rather, they use their limited budgets making lots of short running series, which are pre-written and approved of (rather than the very risky TV pilot approach) and then subsequent seasons/series can be ordered if they were well received. It makes sense. It also can make for more satisfying story arcs, despite them maybe sometimes feeling rushed or under explored having only a handful of episodes, because the writers and creators have to write the whole series at once, rather than hoping the show gets picked up and then cranking out episode scripts at a fast clip week to week. 

I don't think there's something about the British sensibility that makes them particularly love shorter series. If that were the case, then the general public wouldn't be consuming gobs of CSI, NCIS, Law and Order, and on and on.

false,Kitchner,cnty-wales,Wales,"Frankly if you're at the disciplinary stage they've probably already made their mind up as to what is going to happen.

Prior to a formal disciplinary most companies have investigation processes, so you want to brush up on what your company policy is.

For example, at my last company they would collate as much information as possible and then have a formal documented discussion where they would write down exactly what everyone said. Then based on that they would decide whether to progress to a disciplinary. In theory you can bring up things in the disciplinary to defend yourself, but at that stage you'll be asked why you didn't bring it up earlier, and it would need to be really good to defend yourself.

So my general advice to you would be:

1) Check your company's investigatory and disciplinary policies and processes. If they do ANY of this wrong make sure you point it out and it's documented by them as well as you.

2) At the very minimum make notes of the discussion. Personally I'd ask them if they will agree for you to make a audio recording for your own personal use. If they say no write that down.

3) Deny everything. If it's something they literally have proof you did, obviously don't lie, but if they say something like ""Can you see how this could be negatively perceived?"" the answer is ""No"". If they press you on it, tell them that if they think that it could be perceived as negative, that's only their personal opinion.

While this wont get you out of anything obvious or serious (e.g. it will not work for: Do you not see how groping susan could be seen as sexual harassment? ) it will prevent you from tripping yourself up on anything you technically haven't done wrong. If they say ""Do you see how others could see this as negative?"" and you say ""Yes"" then you're admitting that you knew it could be perceived badly and did it anyway.

4) Only provide factual information that they ask for. If you answer more than just the question they ask, you open yourself up for them to grab onto something you said. To use the above example, if they use a yes or no question, answer yes or no. If they ask an open question say the bare minimum needed. The bigger the sentence, the bigger the target for them to hit. 

5) It's likely at some point they will pull out the rulebook and say ""Death-A-Lot, are you aware of the company policy on X as listed on page Y of the employee guide?"" (or the policy or whatever). This is a no-win scenario as if you claim you didn't know it, they can nail you for not knowing something you should know, if you say yes you are admitting you knowingly breached it.

Alternatively, you can do the same to them though. If they say you're supposed to double check every single thing your team processes, ask them to show you the policy that says so. Ask them to show you the process flow. Ask them at what point during your induction and subsequent development as an employee they would have explained that to you. 

If you're told to read all the policy books though, and you say you've read them, you're pretty much fucked as they will get you either way.


6) If this is only happening to you make sure you state in the process that you are aware of this happening previously and the action taken with others was not the same. Make sure they note down that you said that, and obviously you note it down too.

Frankly though, if you haven't been working there for more than two years, and there's no evidence that you're being discriminated against you can't do shit all about it anyway. ",0,1416484991,null,0,false,0,cm7vu7h,t3_2muwua,t1_cm7vu7h,t3_2muwua,null,1425932337,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

In the year 2012, it made a worldwide loss of $39m, even as it had sales totalling $61bn. That year was an aberration, with a costly acquisition weighing the company down, but previous years have been similar. 2011 saw just $631m net income on worldwide sales of $48bn, and in 2010 – the company's most profitable year to date – it scraped $1.15bn of profit on revenue of $34bn.

Now I'm no accountant but I'd be interested to know how a company like Amazon can year after year make a ""loss"" on it's ""profits"" whilst it's ""sales"" are through the roof. Could it be that they're routing various items through different countries and counting sales in Ireland or Luxemberg to ensure their ""sales"" don't make profits in differing countries?

And looking at numbers now petitions of concern would be unlikely to stop that.

While I think the whole package should be brought to the floor for a ballot, that is to say that the opposition has a chance to present their case for a programme for government, and the entire assembly votes on which they want. In a practical sense it will do little but slow the process of the bigger parties from getting in, it gives the smaller parties not in either the government or official opposition a say in how things are run. 

While the DUP and sinn Fein have 67 of the 108 seats, the next viable option would be UUP/SDLP government which only has 27, or 35 if you count Alliance, that's 20 seats short of a majority but the other 6 MLAs would likely be in support of it compared to the alternative option it is only 14 votes away. Assuming of course every body takes the whip, but given some of the vitriol that the DUP have said about Colin McCusker about making a deal with Sinn Fein, in a council that has relatively little power, there could be some interesting revelations.

Unfortunately, there is incredible pressure on JC+ staff to 'get people off JSA'. Historically, this was done by helping them find work so they didn't need to claim JSA anymore. Makes sense, right?

Nope, not to IDS. It's all about the figures. Get people off JSA, whatever it takes. Unrealistic targets? Yep, that's another potential stick to beat you with, meaning sancitons can be applied when you inevitably don't spend a full 35 hours looking for a job.

The most important thing to IDS is that people **don't** claim JSA. Not that they don't *need* to, just that they *don't*.

Do what you can - evidence everything. Write down all the stuff you do to find work. Conversations with friends. Registering on websites. Setting up alerts. Sign up with agencies. Get help with your CV. Send speculative emails to places you'd like to work. Write it ALL down.

Just remember - the poor souls at JC+ are under pressure to catch you out. Not their fault; just the situation they're being put in, and it's horrible. (Although, I've met a couple that seem to even *enjoy* the process... )

Write **EVERYTHING** down.

OK. I feel better now.

Right - structuring your activity.

Are you aiming for a specific job / industry / area? Might help to find industry-specific recruitment sites and agencies if so.

Do you have a list of 'generic' job search sites you check every day? (Universal Jobmatch, plus national news job sections).

What about specific companies you'd like to work for? Draw up a wish list, *do your research*, and make contact with them. Speculative applications are always worth a bit of extra effort, and [there are plenty of guides online to help](http://careers.theguardian.com/speculative-applications).

Create a schedule for each day:

9-10am - check generic sites for new posts, and identify roles you want to apply for.
10 - 12am - write application for new posts identified on generic websites.

1 - 2pm check industry specific websites for new posts.
2 - 4pm write applications for new posts, etc. etc. etc. etc.......

Schedule some time for chasing previous applications, asking for feedback on unsuccessful ones, sending speculative letters, etc.

Compare this to the costs of alcohol &amp; smoking, which together cost the NHS from £8.5bn - £11bn you can see the cost is not as extreme as it's made out to be.

It's also worth pointing out that obesity generally only harms the person suffering from it, whereas alcohol &amp; smoking both have negative health affects on the rest of the community; around 3,000 people were killed or seriously injured in drink driving accidents last year, most of these innocent people who don't drink or drink responsibly.

They're the only ones I would attempt without having your own team to coach regularly.

The Youth Cert is more shape focused, it focuses on small sided games (5v5) and involves workshops and a practical assessment which is actually become a pretty goodstandard now. Before this you need to complete your K.S 1+2 and do a number of workshops like Strength and Conditioning (very basic) etc.

Uefa B - huge step up, a lot of course work, match analysis (they actually send you to matches to provide an analysis which you will be graded on - eg. A coach I work with was sent to an international match recently to analyse the entire game from the perspective of 'defenders defending' - basically, when we don't have the ball, what are the defenders doing - 'pressure cover balance', marking etc.) Its very detailed and the final assessment involves taking a session (or 2? can't remember) with a very focused topic that you will be given eg. Defending wide play, penetrating, Defending through the middle etc .

As for the Uefa A - I'm not so sure exactly of the details - I do know it's extremely intensive and tactical. A couple of my friends have failed their assessment and they are top top coaches. They said they just bottled it on the day - simple as.

Not directly related, but your relationship with your partner should be nowhere near your relationship with a child... We do sort of ""train"" children as we raise them.

&gt; **So, how does an experienced parent deal with a child?**

&gt; Lays down rules

&gt; Never lowers himself to argue with a child (one might call this not giving into shit tests...)

&gt; Rewards and punishes

&gt; Demands respectful treatment

&gt; Doesn't give in to the child's constant neediness (one might call this maintaining frame)

&gt; Doesn't let the child emotionally manipulate them (maintaining frame again...)

&gt; Basically if you haven't figured it out by now, the way you treat a child, is essentially the way you treat a woman.

&gt; I never said it was, I used it more as a literary device before going into my own personal experience. Then after that I put two links which had subjective analysis showing that dropping the tax rate resulted in more money received.

Agreed, I've read them now.  Sad reading, but true from what I can conclude.


&gt; Economics is a bit like saying It looks a bit like this it's a representation nothing more. The laffer curve is simplistic, because it doesn't take into account localities around the curve, differences in peoples lives (ie having dependants vs not).

Accurate

I cannot really fathom that being taxed at 80% on your 5th million pound paycheck is going to really affect your quality of life
--
&gt;Because why are you being paid that in the first place? I've you've already earned 4 million quid, you might think, fuck this, and do nothing.

But someone would then have to be employed in the job you just left? I appreciate my straw-man was quite weak, but I think your argument strengthened it a little here.

&gt;This is one of the issues of higher taxation, the more likely outcome, for someone of that income, would be that they would simply avoid paying the tax. 

That's a separate issue, the mechanisms for stopping tax avoidance/dodging are a whole other discussion.  Albeit you cannot have this one in a vacuum since obviously the ability to avoid the tax increase is real and probably causes some of the results you linked earlier.

Maybe a better question is - if you close all the loop holes, and other methods people use to dodge (legally or illegally) tax they should be paying, would 50% even be necessary?

Closing all the ways to avoid tax should be the primary goal, then you can make adjustments on the rate of tax and have reliable expectations as to the results of those adjustments.  Right now it's as you pointed out, a bit of a hope and a prayer with economic policy and decisions.

&gt; How nice really is the UK? How much of your life do you really need to be here? Non-dom time...

If you make profit in this country, you should be taxed on it.  If you remove wealth from this country, you should be taxed on it.  Your wealth does not exist in a vacuum and neither does the profits of your companies.  The exist because of the customers and infrastructure that exists here, therefore pay your share towards the upkeep of those.

*It might make you rethink about paying yourself more and more handsomely rather than putting the money into something like R&amp;D and other peoples salaries though.*

&gt; You conflate the two issues. People don't pay more into R&amp;D, if they thought it would yield results, they would already be investing that money, or they don't have that money to spend.

I did, fairly put.  

&gt; Also you have this odd notion that one persons remuneration effects the others more strongly than it does. Rather it does in any company I've worked for or owned. You have to pay staff enough that they want to work for you, out bidding the competition, but lower than their productive value benefits the firm. That's it. If one of my last bosses took a £5M paycut, I wouldn't be paid a penny more. The value of the work I was doing was already comfortably 50 times my cost, the reason they were only paying me X, is they could find someone else to do it for X too.

It wasn't so much re-numerating those at the top to use up the £5M difference as helping out those at the bottom.  The labor market seems to be a race to the bottom (and bottom line I do appreciate) with no consideration for quality of life afforded by wages paid.   Which is an issue, and will grow to be a larger issue as we move further into this century.


*Regardless of actual mechanics of the situation, what do you think the ideal is then?*

&gt; I'm not professing to know the answer to that question. More that from my own experience, keeping 32% of a days work, after costs and the like resulted in about 24%, my margins were pretty good. I couldn't face doing it. I couldn't drag myself to do that work for so little reward, my tastes in life are modest enough, a small little flat in zone 4, an economic cheap car, no real designer clothes etc. Why bother with it? Why bother working that hard at all? Why not just work half a year? So all I can say is for me, it has to be lower. 50% is still too high for me, there is psychological/emotional thing about half.

That's actually exactly the reason I think high-tax should exist.  You feel it is not worth your time to work for more than you have due to diminishing returns.  So someone else can then work for the other half of the year moving into the market you have left empty.  

They can be paid the same as you, do the same work as you.  You suffer a negligible difference in quality of life, they gain a significant quality of life.


&gt; All we do know, from objective data, is that the 50p rate was a failure, and was just a political play by the labour party.

Then maybe our questions should be one step up - looking at the reasons why it was a failure and what it was actually trying to achieve other than just political pandering?

that's just evidently not true.

In fact all that exists is a consensus on the right, a neoliberal hegemony who's logic cannot even be escaped by the Green Party or the SNP, supposedly the most 'hard left'. The establishment cannot allow people to think politics exists outside or beyond the current parliamentary system that controls and integrates dissent when it emerges). CofE is only slightly left in the sense that it tries - in an hurried attempt to even appear inline with basic Christian tenets - to look towards helping the poor etc. But the fact that makes someone autocratically 'hard left' is both telling, and symptomatic of how corrupted political language has become. The very fact that the CofE is part of the establishment, with institutional membership of the house of lords and as official relgion of the state, as well as the only recent acceptance of women bishops and general opposition to gay marriage on a holistic basis pretty much totally disproves your incorrect point.

Being fat is a result from the over-indulgence of your right in a society **which is not free, unless you're not contributing taxes**. With the way things are going, people who out of choice get fatter are inherently putting a strain on the resources we *all* pay for to help with things like Cancer and helping little kids get new fucking hearts. 

Frankly, if someone thinks it is a right to be fat and let our taxes be paid to get a fucking gastric band, they need to asses their outlook on  their involvement in a sustainable society.

Yes people are responsible for their own health. Thats why they need better education and better incentives to take control of it. 

If cycling to work becomes the norm, people will become healthier. If people are better educated about healthy eating and the dangers of unhealthy eating, people will become healthier.

I strongly disagree with your lets just give up attitude. 50 years ago, smoking was a cultural norm, it is practically a taboo now. Hopefully obesity can go the same way.

Debunk all the food myths, debunk all the fad diets, get back to basics - what leads to weight gain and obesity?

Losing weight isn't complicated, its just a matter of will power and avoiding bad choices. Heres a few things where people go wrong trying to lose weight:

* Thinking they need a special diet, whether thats low fat, low carb, high protein, ""detox"" or whatever, and that they can simply revert back to their normal eating habits afterwards.
* Buying into some myths that have been perpetrated for a long time, such as the need to eat every few hours myth, or breakfast is the most important meal of the day ""because metabolism""
* Exercising then rewarding themselves with something that has more calories than what they burned off
* Not seeing visible results quick enough so fall off the wagon.

I used to be fat, I went through highschool and university as a chubby kid, then I lost weight by following the most basic principles of calories in/out, I avoided processed foods and sugar and I exercised. And it only took about 5-6 months, I wish I had started a lot sooner.

Heres where I think the problem lies:

People don't know what a healthy diet looks like, they probably struggle with cooking and they probably struggle to afford it, which leads them to pick up ready meals and frozen processed foods because they're cheap and easy to make

It seems many teams will double up on Lamela as he can be a nuisance and my thinking is, if he had a pacy/top full back overlapping him, teams would really struggle to deal with both of them as well as complementing each others game. Lamela cuts inside so often but he can hold the ball up quite well so that Walker could sprint into areas you might see the likes of Zabaleta and Coleman more often. We’ve seen how Rose has managed to keep Davies out of the team with his ability to get forward this season. 

Personally in the system we’re playing now, I think it’s mental to go for inverted wingers without having fullbacks which have pace, ability to cross and confidence or good decision making, which is why Naughton and Dier have struggled at RB and possibly why Lamela's struggling more than Chadli or Eriksen.

Despite the poster befores ramblings, MPs are ultimately accountable to their constituency and have to answer to them. If you subscribe to a mailing list on TheyWorkForYou, you can see how often your MP is mentioning and asking for resources related to your constituency.

If the link from MP to constituency was broken, we would see EVEN MORE London centric policy making. Its already bad enough, but if no MPs cared about their constituency, there is little stopping it getting worse.

Secondly unlinking MP from constituency means parties will have a short list - everyone in the party ranked in how much they want them elected. Basically whoever the leader is will pick ""game players"". No rebel MPs will ever get selected by their party. When the votes come in, only enough votes are there for the ""game players"". Also what happens if we voters think an MP is a knob and needs to go? Tough, he is on the party list.

Finally, PR tends to empower small parties, but not new ones. If I start a new party with constituencies, or even don't have a party and want to be an independent MP, I just run for the constituency and try to get grassroots support amongst its local residents who can get to know me. No one elses votes matter. If I have to get voters from across the country, because there is no constituencies, all I can really do is spam twitter. Parties like UKIP and the Greens have campaign budgets to increase awareness and are known enough that people will even vote for them in protest.

&gt; According to the ASH, in 2012, 77 percent of the price of a pack of cigarettes consisted of tax. Multiply that by the number of cigarette packs sold, and you get an amount of £10.5 billion raised through tobacco taxation. This is six times as much as the spending by the the National Health Service (the NHS) on tobacco related diseases; these were “merely” £1.7 billion. 

But then [this article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8086142.stm) reports... 


&gt; **Treating disease directly caused by smoking produces medical bills of more than £5bn** a year in the UK.

&gt; In 2005, smoking accounted for almost one in five of all deaths and a significant amount of disability, the Oxford University team said.

&gt; The British Heart Foundation who funded the research said tighter regulations were needed on the sale of tobacco.

&gt; The figure of £5bn in 2005-06 equates to 5.5% of the entire NHS budget.

&gt; **Previous estimates have put the burden of smoking on the NHS at £1.4bn to £1.7bn, the researchers reported in Tobacco Control.**

&gt; **But these were based on data from 1991 and because such studies are complicated to carry out, it has not been updated.**

So results may vary. 

This does not take into account lost productivity due to smoking related illnesses, the cost of providing waste disposal for smokers and cleaning up when they don't use it etc. 

Do the figures balance out? Who knows. Would more people smoke if smoking were cheaper? I leave that to the smokers to answer, but my instinct is 'yes'. ",0,1416489215,null,0,false,0,cm7wuae,t3_2mvex9,t1_cm7wuae,t3_2mvex9,null,1425931869,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

If you have a 0% tax, you'll get nothing. That much is obvious. Increase the rate, and you'll get more money.

If tax is 100%, nobody will ever do anything taxable, at least not honestly, and you'll get nothing. Reduce the tax rate and you'll get more money.

Somewhere in between, there's a point where income reaches a maximum. It's unlikely that it's a single smooth curve, and even if it were, we don't know what that curve looks like. But the basic idea behind the Laffer curve is indisputably correct.

I'd be careful with this logic if I were you. It can easily be used to justify regressive taxes. After all, if you only get half the benefit from your millionth pound as from the first, surely the first pound should be taxed twice as much so that each has equal effect on quality of life?

--
&gt;Agreed, I've read them now. Sad reading, but true from what I can conclude.

Dare I say, ask not what X can do for me, but what I can do for X.  I don't consider it sad.  I think the notion that someone should be asked to sacrifice half of what they are doing, whilst others are net beneficiaries is objectionable.  It was not simply luck that allowed me to be paid that money, it was a series of sacrifices, of almost obsessive dedication, self introspection and good fortune.

It feels almost punishing, I studied a joint honours degree, I would have much rather studied just one part of it, but it isn't commercial, I made choices with the expectation of a reward.  I dislike intensely the notion that I should be so heavily penalised, for those who have not made the similar sacrifices.

Right now for instance, I'm working on a new firm, it's a year old now, we're haemorrhaging cash, my work week is about 85+ hours (excluding time spent ranting on the net!).  It is my life.  My girl friend has already asked me to stop, and last night a different friend was expressing concerns about my health if I continue like this.

I'm making a sacrifice, I'm being modest in my demands, the amount of money I'll receive in the event it all works out isn't going to change the world order of the richest in the UK.  Yet some people want to pull me down.  It's hard to continue, emotionally hard I mean, rationally I can see the probability looks good, the company has got many things in its favour (product is well received, market appears more receptive than we first thought etc).

Now I'm been told that it's sad I don't want to give away 80% of that?  Why the hell does someone who bought a house in 90s for £100k, have an asset worth £1m, which they are not paying any tax on, yet I apparently should be?

To me, it is not sad at all that people don't pay 80% tax, or even 50%, because I don't think it's fair.  If you get to super bill gates level worth, I honestly think he does a better job spending his money, than the US gov would.  The social contract should not be because of force.

&gt;But someone would then have to be employed in the job you just left? I appreciate my straw-man was quite weak, but I think your argument strengthened it a little here.

This is the issue with these high end jobs, the difficulty of finding a true replacement.  These are not fungible.  I think this is important, because the idea of capping someone's productivity is based on the idea of their efforts being substitutable, in my limited experience of working with high earning people (Investment Banks, Hedge Funds, Tech Startups) this is most certainly not the case.

This I dare say is where a lot of our differences stem from.  I don't think these high earners are so commodotised as this.

&gt;They can be paid the same as you, do the same work as you. You suffer a negligible difference in quality of life, they gain a significant quality of life.

This is the thing, I wouldn't see a negligible difference in quality of life.  If I was back earning in the 50p bracket (I'm not at the moment!) and someone raised it to 80p I would see a huge drop.  What effectively you are doing here is capping the reward for productivity.  People like to be emotional about what is important, it's akin to *why is the nurse paid less than a hedge fund desk head*, the simple answer is she does less valuable work.  For instance Apple became incredibly wealthy because they created something that people really like, and buy in droves.  Just because I don't the iPhone as a particularly good device, does not mean for a second I can say it's worth less.  People, millions of them, have decided that them having a shiny thing in their pocket is worth more than say funding clean water in Africa.  It's important to keep this in mind, because under heavily planned economies, people like to pretend, they like to be noble, the free market is honest.  Ultimately, that honesty better serves us.

I can only say, if you give away 80% of your income, I will tip my hat too you.  I gave quite a lot one year to my parents, but that is different as I've been conditioned, and would have felt guilty had I not.  But the fact is, I'm fairly certain that like most people, you wouldn't be happy with that.

So quick re-cap, the roles aren't fungible, those providing that value do so because of demand (cartels and such aside!).

The let's fix tax loop holes
--
I never understand this.  It's not simple, it's global.  If some loony types came into power right now and put 80% tax on me, I'd be off so fast.  Why live in the UK?  I'd go to Singapore or Hong Kong.  You can never have loop holes that avoid such flight.  And it's fair enough when you think about it, my earnings have not been just from the UK.  Hell I think only when I had a paper round was it even close.

It's also rather impractical.

&gt;Then maybe our questions should be one step up - looking at the reasons why it was a failure and what it was actually trying to achieve other than just political pandering?

Maybe I'm cynical, but I believe that's all it was to achieve.  

The credit crunch, was not the sole cause of the economic downturn we had.  It was largely due to credit been used to sustain a system that wasn't feasible, sure there was fraud, banks didn't trust other banks and people had not modelled cross correlation in their risk.  But the biggest problem was that most people in the UK were addicted to credit.  It wasn't as if the richest 5% of the country said fuck you guys.  The richest people already lost out disproportionally more than the poorest, this can be seen by the reduction in GINI at the time.

They a line, blame the bankers.  It was that simple, right now it's blame the immigrants.

So what I did was scan sites like Reed, CVLibrary etc, for jobs I didn't particularly care for but could possibly be considered for, so I couldn't be nailed for applying for jobs out of my reach.  With these sites you can attach a standard cover letter and saved CV and apply in about a minute.

Once you've found a few for the day, you'll have spent half an hour, and then you can actually spend your time constructively seeking work, and crafting decent applications for jobs actually suitable for you, knowing the demands of JSA are behind you.

Also, just as tips for anyone, write down EVERYTHING as a job search activity, any local paper, check the jobs section, write it down, check craigslist, the local free ads paper, gumtree, that's another three, any town you go to, keep an eye on shop window ads, that counts.  'Asking friends and family about vacancies' is another.

We could have bought a Gerrard replacement, bought certain players to suit a style of play, brought in top class backroom staff- a defensive coach especially, and also added to depth. We loaned too many players out and replaced them with big money potential players rather than qualoty also. Is Markovic a better option from the bench than Jordan Ibe? Is Lovren a better option than Ilori?

Look at Bayern and Pep Guardiola. Last season was a transitional one, and in three transfer windows he completely changed the team, molded the players to his style and now has a complete team, without spending much money. 

We've bought cluelessly, players who don't fit a system, don't fit our style and its blatant panic buying without a real plan. I just can't see us improving much after spending so much. I feel we've missed our chance to cement ourselves as a top club by wasting so much money.

British MP pay is incredibly low compared to that of other national governments.

&lt;Cynical&gt;I think that's usually the point of this type of report. &lt;/Cynical&gt;

On Pages 37 to 40 we seem to get most the usual information.  Page 40 is especially good helpful to wards my point rather than yours I think.

Despite all the other changes made to the tax systems (all numbers using childless-single because i haven't time to do all of it)

90th percentile differences

2010 to 2011-Earning £991.4 a week, paying 20.5% of that in tax
2013 to 2014-Earning £1035.5 a week, paying 21.1% of that in tax.

Uplift of £44.1 and .6% tax - not bad, .6% of £44.1 average across all the 90th percentile is pretty good!

vs all the others, doesn't actually look that impressive.

percentile | gross £ | tax burden %|
---|---|---|
10th | 15.7| -3.4 |
25th | 18.7 | -2.7 |
50th | 25.7 | -1.9 |
mean | 28.4 | -1.3 |
75th | 32.8 | -1.4 |
90th | 44.1 | 0.6 |

Now I tried to find population numbers for those percentiles, but they helpfully don't list them in the report, so I can't work out the net results of these changes for the periods.  Bearing in mind this report makes some very upsetting reading I think.

Lets take a few averages (since that seems to be all we get in this report:

Number of additional rate taxpayers: 313,000

Number of higher rate taxpayers: 6,280,000

Number of basic rate taxpayers: 5,540,000


If you split some of the gains of the recession into a more equal pie, you'd probably find a lot more tax income from those 10m people who are better off than those 313,000 who are now obscenely better off who already only pay 1.8% more tax than someone making up to than £500,000

That said, on page 32 it says there are only 5000 people being paid at LEAST £2m a year.  I find that a very hard number to believe.  Which just makes me wonder how many of these are being paid in dividends which are being paid at capital gains rather than income tax.

Then we have the whole Average rate of tax issue, where the highest rate paid is the £1,000,000 to £1,999,999 group.  But drops .9% to the £2,000,000 to infinity group.

I'd say the very top of the triangle, are still not paying there fair 45%, and weren't paying the 50% either.

There's no way to prove cutting it to 45% caused the increase in tax receipts, and thus no way to prove otherwise in this instance either imo.

It could quite easily be any or all of the following:

* That those paying in the 45% tax band have seen there incomes balloon in the last 5 years in ways they are unable to dodge/avoid
* More jobs exist with pay rates in the 45% tax bracket
* Less people did dodge it due to the 5% gain with out having to go through complex schemes to avoid it.
* More people returning to the country and declaring there earnings here
* Pay people in dividents instead of income tax which is taxed at capital gains rate of 18% and 28% tax rates for individuals.

So yeah... I'm finding it pretty hard to believe they ever paid it, and reducing it cannot be proved to actually have been the reason for the £9bn increase in tax receipts when other demographics uplifted at the same time.

false,seemylolface,lfc12,,"I'm with you, I hope this is a stop-gap until Sturridge is fit, but I don't think it is.  I have a feeling he built last season's play around Suarez, and now he's gone Rodgers is trying to reinvent the wheel and make a huge shift in tactics.  I wouldn't have a problem with this if there was any kind of sign of progression or improvement from game to game as the season goes on, but we're almost 1/4 of the way in now and we've been looking the same or worse as the season goes on.

I think the genius of Rodgers last season was that he built a system for his players, something that fit them and their style.  We reaped the rewards of a squad full of happy players who were comfortable playing how they like to play, to their strengths.  This season feels the opposite, it feels like he's trying to force the players into a system regardless of if their tendencies match it or not.  He's persisting with Balotelli as a lone forward, leaving Lallana out, marooning Coutinho out wide, and forcing Henderson to sit deep with Gerrard instead of get end to end like he did last season.  It feels a bit like he's stifling the players right now, and that's very frustrating to see.  Even with Sturridge out we have a lot of talent in our team, and we should still be able to bang in a couple of goals per game with Balotelli, Lallana, Coutinho, Sterling, and Henderson on the pitch.  None of them are particularly high scoring players on their own, but they're definitely all very capable of finishing chances.  We haven't been making any chances for them to finish though, and in my opinion it's because Rodgers is asking the players to do things that don't suit their natural game.",0,1416491328,null,0,false,0,cm7xhpe,t3_2mtxp9,t1_cm7xhpe,t1_cm7v9c2,null,1425931481,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

Y'see I think it goes deeper than the typical ""Would you object to close family member marrying a Muslim/Black person/Eastern European"".  Whilst those figures are worrying, I wonder what would happen if the question was reworded:

""If your daughter comes home engaged to a Muslim would you object or have strong feelings about it?"" - No.

If the question were ""Would you prefer your daughter to marry a Muslim, born and raised in Oman, or a white person, born and raised in the UK?"" - I don't care!

Whilst I don't class myself as racist, and have never treated anyone of a different race differently, that second question really makes me think about it.  My brain tells me I should say ""I don't care!"" but is that really true?

Part of my brain tells me that shared childhood experiences, similar backgrounds and no stresses of decided where ""Home"" is would result in a better relationship.  But is that naive and old school of me?  If my daughter doesn't care, why should I?  Similarly wouldn't I just have the same feelings if it was a white person from a generic western country.  Well, yes I would.  So is it still racist?

Anyway, I've gone round in circles here.  But I found it interesting to delve into how my own brain works.  Are these deep dark prejudices of people from other places, or are they justifiable concerns?

Whilst it's easy to say ""I don't care!"" when faced with the above question, I challenge people to examine if this is 100% true.  And if not, why not?  As I said earlier it's sadly part of the human condition.  Familiarity is comforting to us.  Prejudice exists, and I doubt there is a single person out there who doesn't have a little bit of prejudice deep within them.  Remember you don't have to act on it, or ever openly say anything to hold that prejudice.

First off, on the headsets such as the SENA, they do have a place and are great for low speed riding and when in a group. For relieving motorway boredom, next to useless.

When riding at speed, unless you have a very top end Shoei lid or similar, you are not going to be able to hear anything over the wind noise. I know as I have had two Scala Rider sets (similar to the SENA). At the end of the day anything that's screaming load enough to be heard is going to be damaging your ears.

It is actually advisable that you wear ear plugs:
http://www.hondahornet.co.uk/earplug.html

If you are riding at motorway speeds without them, you are damaging your hearing. So that leaves us with an in ear solution. Standard ear phones, even with great noise isolation, are not up to the job. That's where these come in:

http://www.amazon.co.uk/Plugfones-Yellow-Stereo-Earphones-Earplugs/dp/B0083E7T7C/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1416491932&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=plugphones

They aren't amazing sound quality (base is a little pathetic) but they keep your tunes going and protect your hearing. I started using these when I started getting tinnitus after years of not bothering to protect my ears for long motorway rides. Luckily I seem to have caught it in time as it went away eventually.

TLDR; Wear earplugs on the motorway, get ear plug headphones to listen to music.

&gt; and had fun with the generous allowances

Pre-2009 i would have agreed with you. 

But this just shows how extremely bias you are, IPSA is an incredibly difficult organisation to gain reimbursement from. It is rare for anybody to get through their helpline, emails and letters go largely unanswered and the amount of time for reimbursement is sometimes 6 months or more.

&gt; The calibres of the people who get selected says a lot more for the ways the parties work (nepotism, cronyism etc) than a case for paying more.

I think you mean ""elected"" and it shows how apathetic and uncaring the British people are more than anything. MPs are supposed to be elected representatives, they are accountable to YOU the constituent; if you are angry at yours then campaign for a different MP.

Can i ask, have you ever written to your MP? Or do you even know who it is? This problem goes deeper than just Westminster.

&gt; For which you get generous travel allowances and a free place in London to do so.

See my earlier comment and critique of IPSA. Again, pre-2009 i would have agreed; but currently its the complete opposite scenario.

&gt; Some would say that simply paying more is not the solution - proportional representation and even primary elections would help more

Why not both? I want proportional representations and perhaps an even more radical approach such as liquid democracy. But the British public dont, or have atleast voted against it in the past. Only you, the average brit can try and persuade your countrymen of this.

It costs nowhere near what it costs to look after chronic elderly patients.

You've got to think of it in terms of sheer numbers.  There are vast, vast quantities of old people relative to fat people.  The care that the average diabetes sufferer needs is _nothing_ compared to the care that someone with Alzheimer's, dementia or even just frailty needs -- and that care can go on for years and years and years.  What's more, if you turn the young, fat person into an old thin person, they have just as much chance of getting the chronic old age disease as any other member of the population, so you've simply traded one set of chronic diseases for another -- saving no money.

No, because ecigs aren't anywhere near as harmful as traditional fags.

They emit around 1/20th of the amount of nicotine exhaled via traditional fags and none of the carcinogens related to fags, because those are not present in the liquid. 

As long as you're not blowing vapour in people's faces there's far less damage done using ecigs.

I know what you mean though, we literally just signed depth and young players. The only transfers I was happy with was Can and Moreno, either by not knowing them (Markovic) or not being able to figure out how they'd improve the squad (Lallana vs Coutinho, Lovren vs Sakho/Skrtel ect.) and losing Suarez on top of that simply meant our team was far worse even if Sturridge wasn't injured.  

I'm not convinced whatsoever of Brendan yet, despite our success. When Chelsea signed Costa he seemed a perfect fit as he is a ""Mourinho"" type player.

* Use tepid water when you wash your face. Using hot water tends to dry out skin.

* I've started using a konjac sponge (I get mine on ebay) and I've found that my skin has really evened out and my spots and eczema dryness have reduced greatly. YMMV, but I've had problems with my skin being dry and oily for decades and it's starting to be gorgeous now. Also, it lathers really well, so you don't use as much soap/cleanser.

* If you want to try a non-soap cleansing option, I'm going to second the Ultrabland recommendation. It's lovely and works well for a lot of people. I found I had problems with it after a while, but I also wasn't as religious about using it as I probably should have been.

* If you go with a tinted moisturiser and you find that it's hard to apply in a way that blends out well, run (seriously, run) to M&amp;S and get one of the Autograph beauty blenders (it's black and £5 and awesome). Goss on Youtube recommends it and probably has a great ""how to"" application video.

There's a lot of stuff you can do to cover up the issue, but if you can get your skin sorted out, it makes things a lot easier.

You might also want to swing by the Origins counter at a JL and ask if they have any cleanser samples they can recommend. I find Origins to be good for the cleanser options. I also love my NARS tinted moisturiser. It comes in pale enough for me which has always been a struggle.

John seems to think that this is more about the swath of evidence that the US want their pound of flesh for Assanges hosting of wikileaks. 

There's also the fact neither of the women have said they were raped with one even tweeting that she wasn't. 

Keep swallowing US propaganda if you like though. 

&gt;One of the women's messages makes clear that she did not want any charges brought against Assange, ""but the police were keen on getting a hold on him"". She was ""shocked"" when they arrested him because she only ""wanted him to take [an HIV] test"". She ""did not want to accuse JA of anything"" and ""it was the police who made up the charges"". (In a witness statement, she is quoted as saying that she had been ""railroaded by police and others around her"".)

&gt;Neither woman claimed she had been raped. Indeed, both have denied they were raped and one of them has since tweeted, ""I have not been raped."" That they were manipulated by police and their wishes ignored is evident - whatever their lawyers might say now. Certainly, they are victims of a saga worthy of Kafka.

My current set up is I have a phone clamp and a waterproof phone bag attached to my handlebars. The bag has whats essentially a headphone extension lead inside so that you can close the bag and make it completely waterproof and you still have a port to stick your headphones into on the back of the bag (a pic would probably explain it better than I can but I don’t have 1 at the moment). I store my headphones inside the bag and I have a usb cable wired into the bike that I coil up and store inside the bag when not being used. Everything is secured in 1 way or another.
What I do before a long ride is set up my route on the phone, put some some music on and stick it into the bag and plug my headphones and usb cable in.

If free speech is okay why not freedom over our consumption and bodies?

If people want to do these things they will do them regardless of the law. Hence it is done by many now and a lot of people have little moral problems with it.

Prescribing them via the NHS so they can monitor usage and give advice I think is a much safer system then leaving it to the black market and street wisdom. If it's ok for other harmful pleasures like alcohol, tobacco, fast food or gambling to be allowed, taxed but still hold a moral caution towards excessive use then I think that is a more mature solution. Why should responsible law-abiding citizens not be allowed freedoms because some people act irresponsibly? It's like banning driving because some people are bad drivers. Or banning alcohol because some are alcoholics.

Like members of government have admitted to drug use but imagine if they had been caught and got a criminal record? U think they'd have the same successful career now? Drug laws are excessive and harm otherwise perfectly moral and law abiding citizens.

Yes of course drug use can cause problems but I think legalisation is a much maturer solution because it doesn't punish those who cause no problems, definances criminal enterprises, raises tax for government and save money for the justice system. Plus the stigma is partly removed so people can seek help without fear of punishment. Honesty and sensibility is a better attitude towards use of harmful substances rather than just trying to brush it under the carpet and cordon off te issue.

No.  Because obesity leads to early death, and unavoidable old age is expensive, there is no cost saving to be had by beating up fat people.

The two alternatives are:

 - Fat young person with chronic expensive disease
 - Person who would have been fat reaches old age and hence becomes a thin old person with chronic expensive disease

The cost savings only come if you assume the fat people you force to be thin by denying them proper health service are somehow immune to the chronic diseases they will get in old age; or alternatively if you assume that obesity doesn't affect how old you get -- but it definitely does.

&gt; And it doesn't necessarily reduce life expectancy by that much with our advanced health care.

There's no fixed format for postal addresses, aside from the post code itself.

Also, as well as being totally unnecessary for postal addresses, even the four constituent nations fails to cover a variety of cases: the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands, armed forces overseas, the Falkland Islands (which also handle mail for [Antarctica](http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/family_liaison/mail.php)), and so on.

Well in the recent weeks, i believe that Mangala has not been performing up to par, in comparison with his debut performance against Chelsea.

He isn't even first choice for France, so i'm just wondering why we paid 32mil for him, and would be ever ""realize"" this potential that he has been said to possess. 

It doesn't help that in the past week or so, Varane has been said to be quoted with a price tag of 19mil(?) well, although i know that its a long shot for Madrid to even sell him, but if we were willing to splash the cash on a long term option at centre back, why didn't we go for Varane or someone with equal caliber? All in all, 32mil for Mangala just puzzles me. I think he would be worth half that for sure, but definitely not 32mil, as of the performances that he has been putting in in the recent weeks.

Are there greedy bankers out there?  Certainly.  There are greedy people in every profession.  Ambition itself is a form of greed in many ways, whether that's ambition to lead the socialist party or become the highest performing trader at UBS. 

The difference is that banking is a pretty shit job on a day to day basis.  You're hated by the majority of the public, spend your day meeting clients, making spreadsheets, or making Powerpoint presentations about your products or services, and work 90 or 100 hour weeks for the first decade of your working life.  Unlike being a scientist, there's no 'thrill' of making that amazing discovery.  Unlike being an architect, there's no 'magic moment' when you see the building you designed in real life.  Unlike being a lawyer, there's no point of deep satisfaction when you win a case.  Unlike being a politician, you won't ever cry with joy when you see that TV news ticker announce your election victory.   Unlike being a doctor, there's no feeling of incredible happiness when someone thanks you with tears in their eyes for saving their life, or making them be able to see again.  

So given all that, and the fact that you have to be reasonably intelligent and well-motivated to do the job, who would go into banking if it wasn't for the money?  I wouldn't have, and I don't find my job all that unbearable.  That doesn't make me a psychopath, simply someone who wants a nice life and financial security.

Here's the good news: if your UK earnings are below the [Foreign Earned Income Exclusion threshold](http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Foreign-Earned-Income-Exclusion) (around USD100,000) and you've paid UK taxes on them (whcih you will have done, if you're working here legally) then you won't have anything to pay to the IRS.

You do still need to fill out a tax return though. You get three months extra to submit it, so you don't need to get it in until June. The best way to do this is to take a morning off work, go to the US Embassy in Grosvenor Square, and they have a little IRS man squirreled away down in the basement (so my wife says) who will check your completed form and take it off your hands for filing. If you can't get to the embassy then you need to post it out to one of the IRS offices in the States, I think the one in Texas handles all overseas citizens' forms but you'd have to check. [This bit of the IRS website](http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Foreign-Earned-Income-Exclusion---Which-Form-to-File) tells you which form(s) you'll need.

If you're going to be earning more than USD100,000, however, then all the above advice is fairly useless. I'd strongly advise getting a US/UK tax specialist to help you with the form in that case.

Learning to get on without your parents to help you, guide you and push you every step of the way necessarily gives you a certain kind of independence early on.

The school is very much like a university in the sense that outside class time you organise your time yourself. If you are sporty you do sport. If musical you do music. If both you have to work your schedule out. There is no set prep time even for the younger boys so you have to take total responsibility for organising your work.

A huge amount of the extra-curricular activity is arranged by the boys. There are a large number of societies (poetry, entrepreneurship, debating &amp;c.) which have meetings and invite outside speakers. But all these are run by the boys themselves. Any boy can set up a society and invite an outside speaker to visit or get together with friends to discuss a particular interest. A master will be nominally in charge but the boys run the shop.

Boys also arrange concerts for which they set about choosing the programme, recruiting players from among their peers, rehearsing them and advertising all by themselves. The same for theatrical productions--alongside the official plays boys arrange their own performances themselves.

There are a good number of school magazines, too, which offer a different kind of independence. An official one carrying school news, an arts magazine, an 'alternative' magazine, a junior magazine. These are all produced (edited, designed, written) by the boys alone.

I think it's worth pointing out that none of these things requires money. Children with a bit of initiative at any school (state or independent) can get together in their spare time to make a magazine, act out a script or play their instruments and so on.

The boys are also responsibly for a good deal of discipline themselves, too.

They don't, and thankfully that means that the leader of the Conservative Party is based on actual party membership, with one member, one vote - not the horrific mess Labour uses that allows one group to override others, such as E Miliband over D Milband.

&gt; Labour has a primary system for electing candidates, where members (including those signed up through unions) vote on a selection of candidates (sometimes closed list) to decide who will stand.

false,SlindsayUK,cnty-wales,Wales - Swansea,"&gt; I know that’s not the best way of doing things and I do try and rebel against it, but if it’s true of me then it’s surely true of others in tougher circumstances (it’s not like I get home at 9pm with no time to make food, after all).

Urgh, my diet is fucking awful at the moment and it's for exactly this reason - I try to leave the house at 8.00am and in the mid week I get back in between 7.30 and 9 if I'm lucky and if there's one thing that makes a difference in the quality of my diet it's if I need to pick up a ready meal or if I have food in. I used to think that diet was approached in entirely the wrong way and that the only place to really loose weight was at the supermarket choosing what to buy - I still think that's an enormous part of it but there is something that stops you making healthy eating decisions close to bed time.

ETA - and when you're stressed out to, apples actively make me angry when I'm stressed out, I can't explain why, they just upset me.

false,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,"&gt; To those that have gone to university and are supposed to be the best of the best 67K is negligible. I thought we where talking about attracting intelligent highly motivated individuals. Obviously 67k is more than a lot of people get, but for those that have highly desirable traits and intelligence they could be much better served at private institutions that pay in excess of 150k for the exact same skill sets.

So what you're saying is that you want London-area consultants and professionals to be MPs, because that's what you'll get. That'll make a much more varied commons than the law/PPE graduates we get now.

I live in Cornwall. No one gets paid 150k unless you are high up in the council or the NHS. Personally I would like to see people with links to the areas they claim to represent - paying more won't suddenly make this happen.

I don't think social workers or average people who could actually bring a wealth of experience and other viewpoints are on anything close to 150k either.

&gt; I think you mean ""elected"" and it shows how apathetic and uncaring the British people are more than anything. MPs are supposed to be elected representatives, they are accountable to YOU the constituent; if you are angry at yours then campaign for a different MP.

No, I mean selected, as in parties selecting candidates for seats. Everyone who doesn't live in the most marginal of constituencies gets very little say over who really becomes MP - and those people who are party members get a tiny bit more choice.

I don't want to have to ""campaign"" to convince the local party to choose someone else - I'd like to see an open primary election where anyone can have their say and without the machinations of party HQ dictating it.

&gt; Can i ask, have you ever written to your MP? Or do you even know who it is? This problem goes deeper than just Westminster.

I know who my MP is, I keep up to date with what they are doing, but I have not written to them. I did write to his predecessor.

I specifically didn't vote for this guy, although I would vote for the party, because he's a textbook no-experience career politician. The only thing his mum could say about him when she did the doorstepping was that he was local and the Conservative candidate wasn't (but had lived and worked here). Fortunately his position next year doesn't look so good.

&gt; Why not both? I want proportional representations and perhaps an even more radical approach such as liquid democracy. But the British public dont, or have atleast voted against it in the past. Only you, the average brit can try and persuade your countrymen of this.

We have never voted on PR, we voted on AV and that was a shambles of campaign from both sides.

&gt; Apathy is what holds us back, and complaining about it on the internet is not what fixes it. Writing to your MP and sharing your concerns will do more than you know, and if your MP is the sort to ignore you and never reply; campaign for someone different.

And you should know full well that the current system doesn't really allow you to easily unseat an MP.

false,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","Well I'm glad I'm not the only one! 

In case anyone is interested I'll detail my rambling findings...

1) Portion size. 

I'm awful at it. Unless it's in a ready meal if I try and cook (for instance) a Chilli Con Carne which is relatively simply, I'll wind up making enough for four. This is great if you can freeze what you don't need. It does mean you end up having the same meal several times in a row. I do like doing it though, I feel healthier for doing it. 

2) Perishable food. 

I don't drink much milk at home - but even buying the smallest milk carton I end up wasting half of it as it goes off faster than I drink it. Same with bread - I usually want a slice or two, not lots. 

This goes on to vegetables etc. as well. I need to buy food 'on the day' as buying for the week won't guarantee it'll all work out as planned and I don't want to waste money or food. 

3) Oven ready meals / pizzas / other 'simple' food. 

*Way* too easy to take advantage of these. Yesterday I had a microwavable Thai green curry from Tescos. It was very tasty - but not the healthiest option - but it took 5 minutes to make and since I got home at 9pm yesterday after the gym and a coffee, I didn't want to mess about in the kitchen, I just wanted to relax. 

I don't have children or anyone else depending on me - so I can technically do this. 

If I had children I might be just the same - making easy meals so that I don't spend my hours off work in the kitchen, preparing and clearing food.

Packing parliament with ""professionals"" is just a bad as packing them with career politicians. I'd like to see variance, and the current system seems to favour people with party connections and political backgrounds. Paying more won't change that.

&gt; I would say get better qualified people into local government, train them well and use that as a feeder into national government (with the added bonus of have less clueless idiots running councils).

But not in interpreting statistics apparently

&gt; I don't understand what you're arguing with me now. All I'm saying is having an educated populace is a good thing. When you put tuition fee's you bar the lower classes from social mobility which is a bad thing. 

Apart from it still not actually costing a penny upfront to actually go to university, and with repayments linked to future earnings. People who want to go will still go.

&gt; This move only ever was ideological from a conservative stand point. 

You're aware that it was the Labour Party who brought in tuition fees, raised them once, and then commissioned the Browne report (after stating that university funding ""needs to change"") which the current government used to raise them again?

Calling a policy ""ideological"" means nothing, it's used by Labour Party supporters disparagingly. All governments do things ""ideologically"".

All three parties have their share of the blame - and probably Labour more so because they did it more than once

&gt; Obviously with tuition fee's some people are now better at just starting work at 16. But that in my view is a backward step for society for less people being educated at tertiary level.

false,LimitlessLTD,eng-Surrey,Surreeh,"&gt; If you want to discuss capitalism in general, I would argue that greed (or self interest) is innate in almost every advanced mammal

Yes it is, but ""advanced mammals"" havent setup systems which can be inherently abused and actively promote greed.

&gt; and that capitalism merely harnesses that greed to advance civilization

I would argue capitalism facilitates *competition* in order to advance civilization, and whilst competition is similar to greed in a way; they are not the same thing. Competition means having to work harder and more efficiently than your rivals, utilising less resources but to a greater extent. If you do not do this then in nature you die, or in business you fail. Greed is simply the want for *more* money, influence or food, regardless of outside factors.

&gt; while left-wing economic theories attempt to fight it, which is futile and pointless since greed always wins out.

Just because you think it is pointless does not mean we should stop fighting greed all together. It is difficult ill admit, but discouraging it should be a start. I think psychology has a lot to do with this and how children are brought up, and i definetly think that it can be countered in some ways. Whether through swearing an oath or through fines targeted at those specifically responsible rather than the bank itself, accountability definitely needs to play some part in it.

&gt; Are there greedy bankers out there? Certainly. There are greedy people in every profession. Ambition itself is a form of greed in many ways, whether that's ambition to lead the socialist party or become the highest performing trader at UBS.

I 100% agree, but those politicians are *accountable* to the public. If it is found they are greedy liars, they can be impeached, removed, taken to court and even imprisoned or simply not re-elected *by those they are accountable to, the public*.

&gt; The difference is that banking is a pretty shit job on a day to day basis. You're hated by the majority of the public, spend your day meeting clients, making spreadsheets, or making Powerpoint presentations about your products or services, and work 90 or 100 hour weeks for the first decade of your working life.

I am all for paying bankers large amounts of money *if they can do the job well* as offering high salaries to bankers often attracts the most competitive and motivated individuals. But bankers (investment bankers) are responsible for a lot more than scientists or architects. For instance, those at JPMorgan that did the incredibly shady long term currency swaps with Greece which lead to Greece needing a bail out which the rest of Europe paid for. They are not held to account for their disgusting behaviour, and whats worse is that they actually *bet against* Greece; making the bailout even larger to fund. You cannot simply think this is acceptable and can go on, surely?

&gt; That doesn't make me a psychopath, simply someone who wants a nice life and financial security. And to be able to go on a nice holiday in the week a year that I actually take off.

Suarez's workrate was a massive reason why we were able to stay on the front foot.


2) What I mean is, we're trying the same tactics with strikers that are completely different to what we had. We can't just try to pigeonhole them into the system.


3) You obviously don't like my realistic criticism of him. He hasn't been good for us and he hasn't done as well as people act beforehand in his career. He has some great moments but every one of those is combined with 5 infuriating ones. This delusion that having a partner will make him come good is ridiculous. There's been nothing to suggest that. People just need to see all options exhausted before they finally accept that he needs to seriously work on areas of his game.

*The problem is so severe that an overwhelming medical crisis is inevitable unless the problem is seen as a huge multidimensional issue which requires everybody to change their policies and practice. This
means that it is no longer reasonable to simply specify the individual changes needed but now every branch of society has to be involved if we are to avoid an overwhelming financial and societal burden.
The challenge is so great that it is likened to climate change and is a clear indication of ‘market failure’*

My Proposition:  

* Three stick trade minimum - perhaps aim for two 'regular' sticks and one 'special' stick [similar to /r/cigars SS] 

* No 'minimum spend' as people might have sticks to trade that they don't know the value of (trades/bombs etc). 

* The caveat for the sticks is - you *must* be happy to smoke it yourself.

[Clarification: In general you would smoke that stick - i don't mean you cant give it away because you wouldn't smoke it because you don't like maduro wrappers]

* You can send other items in addition to the cigars

* You can send more than three cigars - it is Christmas after all!

* If you're hoping for supreme sticks, don't sign up - not everyone has a box full of AF Opus X!

I'm still of the belief that clawing back space from cars improves a city. For instance, Queen's square used to have a giant road running through it. It was closed on a six month trial in 1992 and the road was never reopened. It's now one of the more pleasant areas in the centre, and of significantly more value than the road would have been.

**Lap of luxury**

The ""being rewarded with palaces and wealth"" bit is a bit suspect too.

They get an allowance from the takings of the Royal Estates (about £20m/yr, out of an annual profit of £200m - i.e. the Royal Estate pays 90% tax), but most of that £20m goes on running the palaces - whether they're occupied by the Queen, an elected President, a government branch or a public museum, they're nationally significant buildings and are going to be kept up one way or another.

Most of their ""expenses"" are covered by the fact they're incurred doing official work. Sure, it might cost a lot for the Queen to go abroad with her entourage - but then tot up how much the US spends every time Obama visits. The US burned more than £20m just flying the circus over to the NATO summit in Cardiff. Air Force 1, Marine 1, Armoured Cars, Osprey Tilt-rotors, etc, etc.

The entire Royal Family spend less in a year than the US spent on protecting Obama that week! We're positively frugal by comparison.

They're not being rewarded with wealth - the money spent is primarily the expenses incurred in them performing official duties or for the upkeep of public property. And it only really extends to the senior royals. The likes of Princesses Beatrice &amp; Eugenie will always have a place to sleep in a Palace if they need it, but they're basically expected to go and make their own way. Yeah sure, starting your name with HRH opens doors but they're expected to go do something productive with their time.


**President? Really?**

The way I look at it is that I've looked around at the current and past crop of European and American presidents, and I'd overwhelmingly take our Royals over the majority of them any day. Sure, there are some stand out Presidents globally but for every good one you'll get a run of bad or indifferent ones.


They're born diplomats, raised from birth to do the job, and moreover they have no electorate to impress - their interest is in the UK being happy and strong, not what's going to get the most votes at the next election. And there's an honesty in that you won't find in the political classes. *They have nothing to gain and everything to lose*. You won't hear a member of the Royal Family get into a car after speaking to a Republican and saying ""She's just a bigoted old woman"".

They've been raised to have a bit more respect and class than that.

Secondly, 'Free at the point of delivery' is naïve.  If you run healthcare for profit, corners will be cut to increase that profit.  The idea that waste will be reduced is, again, naïve:

1) Any cost savings will go to the shareholders, they will not be put back into the services and;

2) Any cost savings for one year/period will result a reduction in budget for the next year/period.  If you save 20% of costs one year/period you will only get 80% of the budget the following year/period.

And dentists also have large overheads and a reasonably risky job - mess up someone's teeth and you open yourself up to legal action. I'd like to have decent dentists who know what they are doing. I can't speak for all dentists but mine (all private, no NHS) does at least 5 days a week and at least one late night - and I'm sure he gets paid well for it.

If the NHS is unable to get dentists to handle NHS work, then that's a problem for the NHS to fix by making the terms better - it would be wrong to somehow force them all to work for the NHS. I'm not sure why it's the private sector's fault here.

They may well have tried to get more dentists on their side. The reason why I am private is because there were no dentists accepting NHS dentists about 15 years ago when we needed one. Now I constantly hear ads on the radio for dentists who have spaces for NHS patients on their books

Private dental insurance is still relatively affordable for most people too (and employers throw it in). ",0,1416502575,null,0,1416502955,0,cm82oye,t3_2mv8r1,t1_cm82oye,t1_cm8283z,null,1425928979,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It's an assertion backed up not just by all-too-recent economic events, but also, I believe, on plenty of research in both behavioural psychology and game theory. Positive reinforcement of risky behaviour leads to increasing risk-taking...until the fall.

&gt; You ignore the fact that investment banking is in essence a risk taking endeavour and will always be one whether you use bonuses or not.

Actually, you seem the one who is ignoring it: if I entrust somebody else with *my* money (and that's, after all, what investment banking is all about), I think I should better set up an incentive scheme that both involves some risk-sharing and does not excessively reward risk-taking. Disproportionate bonuses don't fulfil either premise.

&gt; Irresponsible banks were bailed out and were not adequately punished for their failures

Firstly, there is no such thing as an ""irresponsible bank"". A bank is not a sentient being. The recklessness goes back to individuals running those banks and working in them. And how do you ""adequately punish"" people who ruin entire countries? Drawing and quartering them?

Anyway, lack of *present* punishment can hardly be the cause for *past* misdeeds and errors. Punishment may be useful as a deterrant for future repeats, but I still maintain that it will be still more useful to prevent the sort of perverse incentives that have landed us in the soup in the past.

What I do see is a huge gap between what the experts say and what the government says. We are not led by scientific facts, we are led by ""do as I say"" principle. The government says it's bad for us. Therefore it's bad for us.

I would argue that above a certain threshold of technical ability and knowledge, the difference in ""talent"" between investment bankers, hedge fund managers and the like is orders of magnitude smaller than the differences in monetary compensation between them. The only reason that these individuals receive such massive pay-cheques is the fact that they are in a business that moves large quantities of money, that they have excessive influence in determining the bonuses that they and their peers can receive, and that they have been educated and trained in an ideology that rationalises greed beyond what is basic human nature.

When this ultra-expensive ""talent"" that provides marginal benefits has fully moved to unregulated markets, we will see if European banks can get on fine hiring those fully-qualified but less ""talented"" investment bankers and asset managers who for whatever inexplicable reason do not suffer anaphylactic shock at the prospect of actually paying tax on their income, or that are so selfless that they will be contented at the prospect of a bonus of 100% of their meagre yearly salary. 

I'm willing to bet there would be no significant difference in performance between bonus-capped European and non-bonus-capped foreign banks, and that the monetary drain and risk-taking by the kind of banker attracted by short-term massive payoffs might even be detrimental to non-bonus-capped markets.

No it isn't. You already have a conclusion (bonuses are bad) and you are trying to rationalise it. There is no direct evidence whatsoever.

&gt; If I entrust somebody else with my money (and that's, after all, what investment banking is all about), I think I should better set up an incentive scheme that both involves some risk-sharing and does not excessively reward risk-taking. Disproportionate bonuses don't fulfil either premise.

I tried and failed to distill a coherent point from this sentence. Investment funds are rated for their risk, so don't give them your money if they are too risky.

&gt; Firstly, there is no such thing as an ""irresponsible bank"".

Yes there is, for example in 2008 some banks over-exposed themselves to dodgy credit markets and did so knowingly for short term profit. Individual traders are not just let loose on the markets, they are subject to auditing and account limits to manage their risk. It is the way funds are managed from the top down that decides their level of risk.

&gt; Anyway, lack of present punishment can hardly be the cause for past misdeeds and errors.

Quite right but you've missed the point. The banks now know they can get away with behaving in a reckless manner and so some of them will continue to do so. They should have been made to fail and break up the monopoly in the process.

&gt;  I still maintain that it will be still more useful to prevent the sort of perverse incentives that have landed us in the soup in the past.

Are you implying that excessive bonuses caused the 2008 crisis?

&gt; If you want to see that as me ""just wanting to hurt rich people"", that's your problem, and nobody else's.

That is exactly what it is. The only people calling for this are those that know nothing about the banking industry. Those of us that actually have some experience of these things know that capping bonuses is only going to help damage banks' competetiveness globally and won't solve anything whatsoever.

I would agree with your points here, but I'm not sure what you're implying? Do you think we've just been bungling about in the market for last few years and fucking up due to ineptitude? I'm not saying I don't think that, but I'm not sure if that is what you're saying or not.

If you don't think we've just been making mistakes, then it may be time to consider that players of Remy and Bony's ilk are the ones that we can attract, and that there are, in fact, *not* players between world-class stars like Sanchez and guys like Remy that Liverpool can attract.

I'm undecided on this, but I don't think there is a broad, diverse spectrum of players ranging from 90s to 75s like in FIFA with all the ratings filled in with players. I would say that the market for players is tiered: some lower 90s/upper 80s level guys on the top tier and then a bunch of low 80s/high 70s on the second tier (followed by players we shouldn't be considering). Those second tier guys, like Remy and Lallana, are the kind of players we are forced to go after since we can't snag the top tier. Look at someone like Willian who was probably one of the worst players to be considered world-class by some (if that makes sense) when Chelsea bought him, but he didn't want to come here.

One way to combat this is to buy young players who are second-tier now with the hopes that they will develop into top-tier players.

My final question would be: Regarding the campus network vs ResNet, is this a physical or logical distinction? Say I hooked into one of the ports in a seminar room or a lab, would I still be able to talk to other ResNet kit, or would it be classed as campus wired?

false,Nubgubbler,1953,Didier Drogba,"Arsenal have agreed a deal ""in principle"" to sign Petr Cech from Chelsea, according to reports.

Those are the words of the Daily Star's Chisanga Malata, one of a number of sources suggesting that an agreement is likely to be put in place between the clubs. Anthony Chapman of the Express believes Chelsea ""are open to the prospect of selling"" their unneeded goalkeeper for £7 million and that David Ospina's injury makes Arsenal a top contender.

Reports come shortly after Thibaut Courtois—the man who has displaced Cech in the Blues first team—suggested that he would leave if he was placed in the Czech Republic stopper's position of receiving little game time. 

Christopher Lee/Getty Images
""As a goalkeeper you want to play,"" he told Sky Sports. ""If I was in that situation where I didn't play a lot, then I would leave too. I think Petr is still a goalkeeper with a lot of quality and one of the best there is.""

In October, Cech himself stated that he would have to ""solve"" the problem if it continues. Earlier this month, however, he indicated that he would remain committed to Chelsea if Jose Mourinho decides he is still needed at the club, reported by Simon Johnson of the London Evening Standard:

As concerns my future at Chelsea, it depends entirely on the club. Everyone is asking me what if and what will be. As a player who has two years left on the contract, I cannot make choices. If the club says, ‘you are staying’ then I will be staying. That’s why I’m staying. 

Mike Hewitt/Getty Images
At the reported £7 million, would Petr Cech offer Arsenal value for money?
Yes
No
SUBMIT VOTE vote to see results
This team-first attitude is backed up by Mark Worrall of ESPN FC, who believes Chelsea would be wise to keep hold of Cech. ""The last thing Mourinho needs in what is a pivotal season for him at Chelsea is a goalkeeping crisis,"" writes Worrall. ""Cech may not be happy playing second fiddle to Courtois, but the orchestra is more important.""

Arsenal will certainly represent an interesting proposition for the man who has racked up just 66 minutes of Premier League football this season, per WhoScored.com. Courtois has performed admirably, there's no doubt about that, but Mourinho's suggestion he would ""rotate"" the pair has barely come to fruition.

Cech started both Champions League ties with Maribor—perhaps the Blues' easiest group-stage matches—sandwiched around his Capital One Cup appearance against Shrewsbury. Those matches won't be enough for a man who has remained largely uncontested as Chelsea's No. 1 for the last decade.

Michael Regan/Getty Images
The Emirates represents an excellent opportunity for Cech if Arsene Wenger is in the market for a 'keeper. Wojciech Szczesny hasn't been challenged as much as he would have expected when Ospina was purchased during the summer. The Polish 'keeper has developed into a solid leader for the Gunners, but he needs competition to remain at his best.

Ospina is likely to miss at least another two months before he can even consider mounting a run into the starting line-up. Arsenal's schedule becomes hectic as December and January hit, meaning Szczesny may become overworked. Cech could offer respite without dipping in proven Premier League quality.

Arsenal are already scrapping just to get in top four this season, and they have a huge match coming up when Manchester United visit north London on Saturday. B/R UK's Sam Tighe and Ryan Bailey recently ran through how the Gunners can overcome an injury-ridden Red Devils side:


Szczesny is likely to be key to Arsenal's success—he was when the two teams met last year, pulling off a fantastic save from a Robin van Persie attempt—but a poor showing may up the need for Cech. 

Whether Mourinho would allow such a transfer remains debatable. He isn't against selling stars to rival teams—we saw that with Juan Mata's move to United in January—and could use the extra funds to target his next acquisition.

Alex Livesey/Getty Images
A situation which could suit all, presuming Chelsea want to sell, is likely to appear after the new year.

Arsenal would be wise to spend well but without breaking the bank on a new stopper, while Mourinho's intelligent wrestling with UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules means he is unlikely to miss an opportunity to cash in.",0,1416504957,null,0,false,0,cm84074,t3_2mw6b4,t1_cm84074,t3_2mw6b4,null,1425928311,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

This is wrong, by virtue of the simple fact that most people in consumerist societies are in fact not obese.

The real problem here is that there is little to no indication anywhere in society that at some point, you just need to stop.

This summer, I think BR decided we were going to play 4-3-3 rather than 2 up top, so, in that scenario, someone like Remy as an understudy to Sturridge makes a fair bit of sense as it would be difficult to find other strikers of sufficient quality to want to play back up to Sturridge.  Fair enough, in that case, Remy is probably the best we could ask for- reasonable quality at a good price and a decent backup.

The problem then is, for me, of particular importance in a single striker setup are the quality of the forwards/wingers on either side of them.  We bought Lallana and Markovic, one good player who can play winger/forward but isn't necessarily prolific and the other a kid who isn't near ready for the PL.  If the idea was Remy is the backup to Sturridge, then surely we should have been focused on players to play either side of Sturridge?  

But we weren't, instead we bought another LCB to replace the LCB we just bought, forcing a perfectly decent LCB out of the side entirely.  We loaned in a kid at RB no better really than the RB we sent on loan.  We relegated Suso to the stands, sent Teixera wherever, and couldn't figure out what to do with the bulk of the poor signings from last season and previous windows so just sent them on loan to random locations.

It's all just a giant muddled mess.

And I disagree that from a quality perspective it goes Sanchez-like -&gt; Remy-like really.  There are loads of players I would personally consider better than Remy (granted that's just an opinion) who aren't quite at the level of a Sanchez and I just struggle to understand how poorly planned the whole window was given that we've known Suarez has wanted out for years and he left pretty early in it.

And, again, at the top sit individuals, with their own bonus-based remuneration pushing them in that direction.

There's quite a bit of interesting EE going on, here at work we're dealing with
live processing of multi GB/s of image data and there's a bunch of patents
floating about the building, but the software side is just your standard device
driver/SDK/desktop application stack. There's a couple of companies working on
really cutting edge camera tech and such, but again nothing particularly
notable in the software end. There's also some guys doing firmware for medical
equipment, but even in that area where you'd think ""formal verification would
be awesome, lets lean on some recent theory"", nope, typical embedded C with a 
fuck ton of tests.

I have a couple of friends in Southampton who're working on the LLVM compiler
adding in features to make various memory errors impossible at the flick of
compiler flag. They were talking to me about another startup doing automatic
paralellisation of C that's then compiled to FPGA. I've a friend in Manchester
who just started a company where the product is a formally verified high
performance trading platform (it provably: halts, is productive if fed data,
and has realtime and memory usage guarantees).

I think the best way is to imagine if you were the hiring manager what would make you happy and rejig your CV accordingly, even if it means being more detailed on each section to make it easy for them to say yes rather than decide you're probably too experienced. I got a CV from a guy last week which wasn't laid out traditionally, was just an essay about his life. It made him stand out...but not in a good way.

Are most of the businesses you are applying to really small? Sometimes you can get away with ringing up those sorts of places to see if you can talk to someone there about your CV to explain why you are willing to take a step down. Bigger companies get annoyed by this though.

If you want to know why prefixes cover different sized areas its because they cover a certain number of addresses rather than physical area.

This money is coming from existing aid budgets, it's not new - it's already been set aside so it was never going to be used in the UK in the first place. People should have been angry when we set the budget not now it's being used.

Besides this is £720 million, less than 1000th of the government's budget it's hardly splashing out. It's the equivalent of about £25 to most people by comparison. And what it will do is help developing countries tackle climate change and create more of a consensus around reversing it and potentially save many people's lives. Climate change will cost the UK quite a lot in the long run (not least in infrastructure damage as storms get more violent); that cost was caused by terrorism there would be trillions thrown at the problem by a united coalition of nations. But apparently if it's only climate change then 0.098% of our budget is just ostentatious. 

But hey, if we really need money for flood defences why don't we stop gifting over 2.5 billion *every single year* (which would have increased the amount spent on flood defences in this parliament by 20x) to the fossil fuel industries instead of gutting the one indisputably good thing the UK government does with it's money. 

EDIT: Actually, given this is a one off payment across an entire parliament it's probably not entirely fair to factor it into a single year.
