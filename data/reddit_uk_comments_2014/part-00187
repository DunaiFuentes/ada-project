true,harberton,null,null,"You know it's just a private house? What information do you expect us to get? Are you expecting someone to knock on the door and then expect the occupier to know much about it?

EDIT:
Just to add this. You may already have this info.

I believe this is the house. It was for sale in 2012 and sold for £650,000. 
http://www.rightmove.co.uk/house-prices/detailMatching.html?prop=36663194&amp;sale=47416040&amp;country=england

The name is listed as Old Pound Manor, bit if you compare the floorplan (especially Floorplan 2) with the plan of it on the map on this link http://www.shepway.gov.uk/UserFiles/File/pdf/planning/conservation-areas/newington-appendix-2.pdf and then also look at the photos of it in this link http://www.shepway.gov.uk/UserFiles/File/pdf/planning/conservation-areas/newington.pdf you can see it's the same building. 

I'm not sure what else to add. What are you looking for? Grade II listed buildings aren't hugely rare and they don't have to have any real historical importance. Any building still with a lot of original features built before 1700 will be Grade II listed. It doesn't mean there's any sort of interesting back story to it.

Taking photos of it could be problematic too since it can't really be seen from the public highway, so you'd need the permission of the land owner to get access and take photos, but the listing from the estate agent should cover it.",0,1404252443,null,0,1404253592,0,cim3j53,t3_29lfaa,t1_cim3j53,t3_29lfaa,null,1434505404,7,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,7

Gallagher needs to be loaned out, where he will play regularly against future/ex-premier league players (Championship basically) he isn't going to turn into the striker he should do, on our bench, I don't think anyway.

true,JohnShit,eng-wiltshire,Wiltshire,"&gt;But your claim that ""it's still valid"" suggests that you still think it's valid, which it isn't.

If all you mean by ""valid"" is ""correct"", I've said three or four times now that it wasn't correct, initially in the second sentence of my first reply to your first comment. However, you said that it was ""entirely invalidated"", which I disagree with because part of my purpose in commenting in the first place was to point out that the materiality of the comment was significant and questionable. What I shouldn't have said in my third comment to you was that ""if the answer she gave definitely did not lead them to find as they did, then it isn't perjury, which was my original point"", because that wasn't my original point in fact; it is merely related to my original point. It would be very easy to go through your posts and make similarly snide comments about inconsistencies and inaccurate statements that are incidental to the subject, but I can't really see what purpose it serves. Maybe you can explain?

&gt;If you're losing the will to live, feel free to stop replying.  

If need be, sure, but I'm trying to understand your points because they don't appear to be stupid, even though some of them appear to me to be wrong. I assumed that you were interested in the discussion and  could possibly be persuaded to spend less time on aimless fussing, but correct me if I'm wrong and I'll save myself the bother. In short: I'm not interested in your opinion of me, but I am interested in your opinion of this particular subject, so I'd be grateful if we could just focus on that. Otherwise, sure, I'll give up.  

&gt;But it is entirely irrelevant in a discussion about a red fruit - or in this case, "" a statement that might have affected the outcome of the proceedings,"".

We don't know if this is a red fruit. Firstly, I don't think either you or I have established what the ""heart of the matter"" was for this select committee, i.e. in practice, what outcomes were available to them; if you know, please say so because obviously it's relevant. Secondly, to prove materiality, it would have to be demonstrated that there was a course that the proceedings might have taken but for the false statement and which might have led to a different outcome. Is that the case? If so, please say how. Imagine that every other element of perjury has been satisfied (which it hasn't, but for the sake of argument) and that you are prosecuting this case, and tell me what course you would be raising that the proceedings might have taken but for the statement which might have led to a different outcome.

&gt;Apologies if I'm misunderstanding, but your argument seems to be based entirely around the fact that a couple of specific judges only mentioned a couple of specific reason why something could be considered perjury, and that therefore this excluded other possible reasons. If so, I'm really not sure I follow your logic.

Misunderstanding or just not reading - you tell me. To reiterate:

""There is currently no authority that says that it will be material if it is clear that nobody relied on your statement but it was possible that they could have. *That remains to be seen.*""  

But you really can't disregard these statements as ""a couple of specific judges giving a couple of specific reasons"". The statement from Millward in particular is part of the ratio of the case, i.e. it is precedent made in the Court of Appeal which continues to bind every judge considering a perjury case at first instance. It is, judging by the sources I've checked, the leading authority on the interpretation of materiality with respect to perjury.

It is also, crucially, the authority for the proposition that ""the test for materiality is whether a statement might have affected the outcome of the proceedings, not that it would have done"". Therefore, if you want to understand what that means, you have to look to what the court meant in Millward. Your argument is a nonsense: on the one hand ""you've neglected that a statement can be material if it only might affect the outcome"", which is true and is drawn specifically from the text of Millward, and on the other hand ""it doesn't matter what Millward meant by that sentence, it's just one case"". It very much does matter, and you can't have it both ways.

&gt;Do you instead have any judges stating that deliberately lying by admitting guilt wouldn't be perjury? It's quite clear that a guilty plea might affect the outcome of a trial. Take Vicky Pryce for example, who was found guilty of perverting the course of justice for pretending to be guilty of Chris Huhne's speeding ticket. What's that got to do with perjury, you may ask? The SFO has the answer - ""In most cases, perjury will often amount to perverting the course of justice. It is appropriate to charge with perjury if the perjury is the sole or principal act. If however it is part of a more significant series with the aim of perverting justice, perverting the course of justice will be the more appropriate charge.""  

Firstly, this is another unworkably distant analogy; either that or an irrelevant digression, but I assume that you meant it as the former. Was Rebekah Brooks on trial for paying the police for information? No, and clearly there was no question that Pryce's statement affected the outcome in any case. Did Brooks stand by her statement or tacitly accept Andy Coulson's immediate contradiction/qualification of it? Clearly the latter, and that is relevant to the question of whether it might have affected the outcome of the proceedings. The two statements that you're trying to compare aren't comparable.

Secondly, and somewhat incidentally, the SFO says that ""perjury will often amount to perverting the course of justice"". It doesn't follow that perverting the course of justice will necessarily amount to perjury.

Thirdly, it is missing the point to ask whether there are any judges saying ""x is immaterial"", because the burden of proof is always on the prosecution to prove that the false statement IS material. If there is no authority for materiality on a given basis, then either the court will have to a) regard the statement as immaterial or b) make a new argument for holding the statement to be material. If the latter had happened in the last twenty years, it is highly likely that it would have been appealed to a senior court and we'd have an authority one way or the other. Can you find one?

What?

The F35 would be useless as a strike nuclear bomber.  We'd be better off buying a fleet of old thuds.  The F35 is a jack of all trades master of none type thing.

It's entirely invalid in the context of the discussion. I.e. irrelevant.

&gt;We don't know if this is a red fruit

Well, we do. Because that's how I phrased the analogy. And to bring it back to the discussion, we've established (as I explained) that claiming guilt of a crime you didn't commit can  clearly be material to a trial. So it's irrelevant to bring up the point that it can also be perjury in circumstances that don't apply in this case - i.e. actually influencing the verdict.

&gt;Was Rebekah Brooks on trial for paying the police for information?

We've already established that the ""not on trial"" argument could be a perfectly valid one against it being perjury, but that wasn't what you'd tried to claim in the original post.

&gt;No, and clearly there was no question that Pryce's statement affected the outcome in any case

And you're back to claiming (despite having admitted multiple times that it's wrong) that the actual outcome is critical to it being material.

&gt;Did Brooks stand by her statement or tacitly accept Andy Coulson's immediate contradiction/qualification of it? Clearly the latter, and that is relevant to the question of whether it might have affected the outcome of the proceedings.

Now, that *is* a relevant point - an immediate retraction may well have an impact on whether it's perjury or not. But again, that's not what you were claiming in your original post. You seem to be missing the point of my argument, which may be why you are thrashing round in your responses. My point wasn't at any point that she *is* guilty of perjury - it's that whether a statement actually influences the verdict or not is irrelevant - it's whether in the minds of reasonable people, it could do. And my current problem is that, despite agreeing several times that your statement was wrong, you then go on to act (as with the previous comment about Pryce's trial) as if it is relevant.

&gt;Secondly, and somewhat incidentally, the SFO says that ""perjury will often amount to perverting the course of justice"". It doesn't follow that perverting the course of justice will necessarily amount to perjury.

Nor did I claim it was.

&gt;Thirdly, it is missing the point to ask whether there are any judges saying ""x is immaterial"", because the burden of proof is always on the prosecution to prove that the false statement IS material. 

And the Pryce case has demonstrated quite clearly that pretending to be guilty *can be* material.",0,1404255039,null,0,false,0,cim4put,t3_29etc0,t1_cim4put,t1_cim43d8,null,1434505810,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,JohnShit,eng-wiltshire,Wiltshire,"&gt;Well, we do. Because that's how I phrased the analogy. And to bring it back to the discussion, we've established (as I explained) that claiming guilt of a crime you didn't commit can clearly be material to a trial. So it's irrelevant to bring up the point that it can also be perjury in circumstances that don't apply in this case - i.e. actually influencing the verdict.  

So it's an analogy for your other analogy? Could you please relate this to the situation with respect to Rebekah Brooks?

&gt;We've already established that the ""not on trial"" argument could be a perfectly valid one against it being perjury, but that wasn't what you'd tried to claim in the original post.  

You're not paying attention. I'm giving this as a reason why the analogy is unworkable and/or an irrelevant digression, nothing more.

&gt;And you're back to claiming (despite having admitted multiple times that it's wrong) that the actual outcome is critical to it being material.  

Again, not paying the slightest bit of attention. I am saying that in Pryce's case, we don't even have to consider whether it might have affected the outcome because it clearly did, therefore it is not comparable. The apple in Pryce's case is green.

I'm not going to bother with the rest of the post because, frankly, it isn't worth my time if you aren't even going to read it properly. You can write a proper response if you want a proper response. But...

true,IAmNotAmerican,cnty-expat,I don't belong here,"I think the worst part is, I seem to recall reading somewhere that in cases of child abductions that;

a) if the child is too old (and therefore able to correctly determine that the abductor is not mummy/daddy and able to inform other adults) that they will be killed.

b) If snatch becomes too public, in other words too much risk of the child being identified, then also their fate is sealed in the same way.

They'll want to overtake regardless of what you're actually doing, and they'll pull out just to be in front of you. You be sure to tell them to fuck off. 

Always maintain good road position, don't move over to let people overtake you, because that will encourage them to zoom past when it's not safe without giving you room. On the other hand, don't block someone from overtaking, just hold your line and speed and let them do their thing. If someone's tailgating you, wave them back but don't do anything else, if it's really bad just pull over and let them go away. Don't get caught up looking at them in your mirror, keep your eyes forward. If they hit you from behind, watching them in your mirror won't help you anyway, since you don't have the power to GTFO in a hurry. 

That said, you probably *will* be on the slower side for a few weeks, at least if you're smart you will be, because you don't have the skills or the confidence. Plus, your bike won't be fast.

Let Lukaku get the same opportunity Torres had and then you can judge him. Torres pulling defenders is just a myth! Please show me a video evidence of different games he did that. Torres is so rubbish that defenders don't even need to pay attention to him. He is always running in the wrong directions and he mostly stays far away from the 18 yard box. How is that a threat to the opposition? If a player can be a liability for his team then Torres has been by far our biggest liability.

true,beyondReturn,null,null,"Sturridge and Sterling will thrive with more responsibility and Suarez has stuck around long enough for them to ""grow"" into the first team. Rodgers has complete control of both of them so we won't see any attitudes that rising stars suffer when there is no better player around. Much like Gerrard has done with integrating academy players and talking with Suarez at a time the club and manager were scolding him. He has nurtured both Sturridge and Sterling and now that we have seen what they can do, we can realistically let him go (if decent player comes in) without fearing the worst.

If Suarez leaves and another high profile player comes in that isn't a striker, I expect Sturridge to score 25-28 goals in the league. He has decent shot that he avoids when there are players in the box that he would probably start taking if he isn't competing for goals with another striker. Sterling has already gotten the confidence he needed, Sturridge would never have been able to provide him the 5-7 assists Suarez did and he might still have felt inadequate. Luckily for us we saw from the Norwich game that he took his chances with no care for others when he had a chance.

Losing star players can result in Tottenham style collapse (shit even when they had him) or other players thriving from more responsibility and freedom.

Lastly for us this is very ""good"", we will lose some goals and assists that Suarez provides, but we will regain a clear and simple identity. 2 strikers has forced us to limit ourself to diamond or 352. Now diamond will become a great option rather than the only option to the horrible 352. Sterling and Lallana wide with license to come in will allow Henderson to take runs right behind the striker, same with Coutinho who is forced to take deep runs when he is cm in diamond.

To replace Suarez we will need 2 more players hopefully both wide. Play with Sturridge as striker, let Lambert take over when needed, have one wide player that can play front 3 and that is enough cover.

One of the better results of the diamond is that we can give players chance to play as striker with little risk, but we lose our ability to give chance to younger players in the last minutes as they haven't played that way before. 433 will hopefully allow us to throw in some of the younger players (even out of position) out wide with little risk and allow them to express themself. Henderson, Coutinho and Sterling are some of the players that were primarily played wide before they were trusted in the center where loss of possession is far more dangerous and tactical awareness far more vital than running up and down the wing.

Start thinking of our team as a system and letting players go will become much easier, some players just don't fit our play style, while other players can be replaced with some work.

&gt;

&gt;___Absolute Power___ is a British comedy series, set in the offices of Prentiss McCabe, a fictional [public relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations) company (or 'government-media relations consultancy') in London, run by Charles Prentiss ([Stephen Fry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Fry)) and Martin McCabe ([John Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bird_(actor\))).

&gt;It started in 2000 on [BBC Radio 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_4), lasting until 2004 with the fourth and final radio series. A six-part television series ran on [BBC Two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Two) towards the end of 2003; the second six-episode television series ran on BBC Two on Thursdays at 10 pm from 21 July to 25 August 2005. A one-off radio episode was broadcast on 3 November 2006.

&gt;The title is taken from a quotation by the historian [Lord Acton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dalberg-Acton,_1st_Baron_Acton) that ""power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely"".

Those mines were not viable by the time Margaret Thatcher moved into number 10.

Russia - an aggressive nutjob in charge who has no problem making land grabs, and no problem pissing off the west. We have fought several proxy wars against them already. And don't they have a track history of misplacing nuclear materials too?

China - a dictatorship, fighting with other regional powers over some islands, including entire countries like Taiwan. Also, their future is not particularly stable imo since they are changing so rapidly.

India - a country with widespread poverty, corruption and a generally distasteful society IMO - but bizarrely enough money for a space programme and hundreds of nuclear weapons

Pakistan - a hotbed for breeding terrorism, in a highly unstable region, with frequent terrorist attacks on their own soil. I don't feel great about Pakistan having nukes. How long until the government gets overthrown, or have some sort of accident.

Israel - the worst kept secret ever. But another highly unstable area of the world, and they have no problem using force

That only really leaves the USA, France and the UK as the stable owners of nuclear weapons.

45% tax rate. aka, higher than for the entire duration of the last government.

They also phased out benefits for higher earners

They also phased out the tax free allowance for higher earners too, increasing their actual tax rate beyond 50%

Osbourne introduced a bank levy

Osbourne brought in a whopping tax on buying property in the UK through a foreign company (a way of previously dodging tax).

Basically, the richer are now paying more tax than they have for the last 20 years.

&gt;""inequality has now risen to the same level as before his government came to power""

I think this criticism works better for a player like Finnbogason who is really that type of striker.

However Tadic is not that type of player. He is a creative attacking midfielder, who can play out wide but more recently has been playing #10, and arguably has been the best attacker in Eredivisie for two years in a row (this year he had 16 goals - 4th in the league - and 14 assists to lead the league).

I'm not so sure about that. I just posted a sincere, thoughtful, non-trolling topic asking what Liverpool supporters would do regarding the Suarez situation and it was deleted within 10 minutes. If there's a sub-reddit ban on topics discussing the Suarez ban that I don't know about, it just started a few hours ago, because there are a couple other new ones since today.

And here's the pot-stirring question I asked:

Disclosure: I'm not a supporter.

I've heard a lot of criticism of the ban but no alternatives. What do you think would've been an appropriate punishment in this case? Most people feel it's excessive because it punishes Liverpool for something that occurred while playing for Uruguay, and I understand this. But considering the fact that missing competitive matches evidently has no effect on Suarez biting people, what do you think FIFA should have done in this case?

Some things to keep in mind, they do not have a mandate to issue a lifetime ban, only 2 years max. And if it were limited to international matches, it's coming right at the end of a World Cup cycle, which means it wouldn't be continuous and would not cover anything of real significance (Copa America 2015 is the next meaningful international competition). Does anyone believe that missing a couple of friendlies every few months, while it's business as usual in his footballing life, do anything to affect his behavior? (Remember this was intended to punish Suarez, not Liverpool.)

I think this is a huge reason for banning Suarez from all footballing activities. While it's unusual and unprecedented, I also think it's also one of the only things any authority, whether the Dutch Eredivisie, English FA or FIFA, could do to get Suarez's attention. 7 match ban, nothing. 10 match ban, same. And considering that Suarez wasn't playing for Liverpool, would a 15 match ban seem any better to you, let alone effective? This ban, at least to Liverpool, is pretty much what he got the last time with the added training part. I think FIFA was limited in their options and this 4 month ban from football, with an understandably unattractive ""out"" to Liverpool to trade him, was the best option available in an all-around crappy situation.

I'm curious to hear what Liverpool supporters think. But before you respond, imagine what your answer would be if Suarez played at Man United instead of your club. If that doesn't change your answer, I'd love to hear it. If it does, than maybe not. Thanks.

After seeing Tim Howards display of pure awesomeness today a selfish, hipster part of me wondered if a lot American fans would start rooting for Everton. At first I wanted to show everyone that for 7 years I have been getting up at 6 and 7 am on the weekends with newborns just to watch my team and support them. My flag, scarf and car sticker have been worn for long before America discovered the heart of Everton. I was there before it was ""cool"". Now that a few hours have passed  I am ok. I have preached to many soccer newcomers the greatness of our club. ""Soccer"" in America will take time to develop but we are getting stronger. Everton as a club needs as much support as possible and if American fans supporting us can lead to more money for transfers, well I can get behind that even if it is for just our keeper right now. We are seeing a huge increase in soccer popularity in the US and if that helps Everton in any way I will support that and try to spread the knowledge and passion that I have for this great club!

No. It's my original analogy (""Is that red fruit there an apple""). Do try to keep up.

&gt;Could you please relate this to the situation with respect to Rebekah Brooks?

Do you mean like ""And to bring it back to the discussion, we've established (as I explained) that claiming guilt of a crime you didn't commit can clearly be material to a trial.""?

&gt;I'm giving this as a reason why the analogy is unworkable and/or an irrelevant digression, nothing more.

No you're not. The discussion was about whether admitting to a crime you didn't commit can be ""material"" and that trial demonstrates clearly that it can. The fact that Brookes wasn't in a trial isn't relevant to that particular claim - like I say, it's relevant to the wider question of whether it's actually perjury, but that wasn't the thing I was discussing.

&gt;I am saying that in Pryce's case, we don't even have to consider whether it might have affected the outcome because it clearly did, therefore it is not comparable. 

So what we are showing is that pleading guilty to a crime you didn't commit might affect the outcome. And we've already established that whether the outcome was actually affected is irrelevant - it's whether it might affect it. I'm not sure what you're not following.

&gt;This is the kind of shit I'm talking about. What is it for?

Oh right. So I've ignored the ""If you want to be an arse about it,"", the ""Oh please. "", the ""Do you see how this is a massive waste of time? "", the ""Misunderstanding or just not reading -"" etc, etc.

* A humanoid sized robot helper is created after building an alliance with a robotics factory. Labeled with the written letters rho and ""d"", the two usually call it by the genderless name ""Alex"".

* Romana is able to repair her TARDIS with the engine parts of a SIDRAT Susan knows of. While unable to travel backwards in time, and with distinctively different engine noise, the craft is capable of FTL space travel.

You can submit URLs to be tested by visiting https://www.Blocked.org.uk by installing the Android app or by tweeting a URL with the hashtag **#IsBlocked**

Once we receive a URL it is dispatched to all probes over a period of time where it is checked against a known list of blocking methods.

The results are returned back to the API for public evaluation.

For example: https://www.blocked.org.uk/results?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fnsfw

Please help us build a picture of UK Internet Censorship by adding URLs to be tested, by helping develop new probes *(browser extensions, an iPhone client etc etc)* or just by spreading the word that [Blocked.org.uk](https://Blocked.org.uk) is available.

Princess (then) Elizabeth joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service as soon as she turned 18 in February 1945, as a Second Subaltern, which was the Women's equivalent of a 2nd Lieutenant, and she was promoted to junior commander (lieutenant) five months later. She was fully trained as a vehicle mechanic and driver (which at the time included lorries which were notoriously difficult to handle).

She served until the end of the war as a driver and did not just make camera appearances. 

We have a history of our royals actually going and doing the war fighting bit. Admittedly the reining monarch hasn't led an army for some time, but the ""minor royals"" and direct heirs have been serving this country for years.

Edward VIII, whilst the Prince of Wales, served in France in WW1 and wished to serve in the front lines. This was forbidden by the Secretary of State for War in case the Prince was captured by the Enemy, but the Prince still performed a normal role as a staff officer. 

Prince Andrew, one of the Queen's sons, flew helicopters for the Royal Navy and was co-pilot of a Sea King in active service in Argentina, taking part in anti-submarine warfare, and more importantly, casualty evacuation missions. 

And Prince Harry has served in Afghanistan. Admittedly his deployment to Iraq was cancelled in the first instance because of ""specific threats"" made against him, but this was mainly to protect the men around him as they would come under increased targeting because the Iraqis wanted to kill a royal. But he did deploy to Afghanistan where he served on the front lines for a tour of duty. He then qualified as an Apache gunship pilot, being described by his trainer as a ""natural pilot"" and he graduated top of his class. He then performed a tour of duty as a gunner/co-pilot in an Apache in Afghanistan. ",0,1404285748,null,0,1404286694,0,cimgb5j,t3_29kc6g,t1_cimgb5j,t1_cim6baj,null,1434511908,4,false,INGLIN,t5_2v1ve,4

&gt;    Count one: A woman said Harris touched her inappropriately when she was just seven or eight while he was signing autographs in Hampshire in the late 1960s.

&gt;    Count two: Harris was accused of groping a teenage waitress's bottom at a charity event in Cambridge in the 1970s

 &gt;   Counts three to nine: A childhood friend of Harris' daughter said he repeatedly indecently assaulted her between the ages of 13 and 19, including once when his daughter was asleep in the same room. He admitted a relationship with the woman, but said it began after she turned 18.

&gt;    Counts 10 to 12: Australian woman Tonya Lee, who has waived her right to anonymity, said he fondled her three times on one day while she was on a theatre group trip to the UK at the age of 15.


Well for the seven year old, how the fuck can a seven year old remember anything about anything 45 year later?  I call bullshit on that one.  Childrens minds routinely confabulate reality.

Count 2?  Groping someones ass in the seventies?  If she was too young to engage in a sexual act, she was too young to be working as a waitress and shouldn't have been there, which suggests Rolf may have reasonably considered her to be of age.

Counts 3-9: He was naughty here but it is acknowledged that the relationship was consensual.  Yes blah blah, youngsters can't consent etc.  If that's the case, they shouldn't be forced to go to school as they can't enter into contract.  Teenagers are sexually active from that age onwards.  

Counts 10-12 again, we're talking about a young female that could reasonably be assumed to be of age at the time.  No sexual intercourse happened.

I can't help but suspect that laws that didn't exist back then but have been brought in via Blairs Labour government and/or EU decree are being applied retroactively where they really shouldn't be.

The whole thing seems utterly hypocritical and all the posts I have seen on reddit has been populated by people out for blood.

I have read the book you recommended in the other thread (thank you by the way) and although I am in agreement with some parts, especially the cost of investment. I honestly believe the correct utilsation of renewables in the manner I mentioned could achieve a considerable benefit to the future supply of the UK network.

The rent in Exeter can be pretty high though (although in my last year I got a place for £75 a week, I wish it was like that in Edinburgh..) that should be your main concern and will be a shock from Leeds.

It's a nice uni though! There's an Out of Doors Society there I can highly recommend - they go walking on the moors and visiting Tintagel out in Cornwall and loads of other cool stuff and each trip is like a fiver each weekend it's pretty awesome as otherwise you'll likely stay in the city and not appreciate the beautiful surroundings so much.

Also rent a canoe (you can do it from a shop on the quay) and row down the river at least once, it's so relaxing (and cheap if you can get a group of friends, more fun too..)

true,pking8786,null,null,"I used to work in security, and one of my contracts was for Tesco, a few of the stores required the guard to keep people in line and restrict the number of reduced items they could buy (3 items per customer), this was in the superstore in the centre of Liverpool. This was after a punch-up over some reduced lamb shanks or something daft. In one of the smaller express stores in the city centre it got so bad that I had to do the reductions because people have no issue being inconsiderate to Tesco staff, and I had a tendency to speak my mind and rattle people. 

Luckily the customer complaints line gets a bit convoluted with regards to complaining about an externally employed security guard with no nametag, telling people to get out of his personal space. I was always professional about it, but very strict. But, after seeing how they treated a member of staff (the catalyst that led me to take over) in which a middle aged Chinese man shoved a pregnant member of staff out of the way, causing her to trip over a green tray, I became a bit of a troll about it. 

I would reduce things, and when people went to grab them from me, sometimes directly from my hands. I would say "" what are you doing? This is MINE, I'm having this for my break"" and some would back off, realising how rude they'd been (Could you imagine snatching something out of the hands of another shopper?). Others, however would try to tell me that staff aren't allowed to buy reduced items, where they got this notion from I have no idea! To those I would just tell them I don't work for Tesco, which would usually confuse the situation further. One time I enraged a customer to the point where they said ""well, I don't want any of your shitty fucking sandwiches anyway!"" and stormed off. (I saw him 15 minutes later with one going through self service like nothing had ever happened) As he left, I said ""enjoy"" and he shot me a look that was a mix of rage and shame.

Anyway, me and the missus just happened to be in Tesco one day on a Sunday. First we saw a few people pushing trollies laden with boxes of strawberries, and when I say laden I mean literally 20+ pallets. We saw a group of people (probably around 20, mostly older women, though not exclusively) hanging about the green section close to the door, so we guessed it was something about reductions being made. We were new to this game, so we hung around too.

There is this tension in the air while you wait. Everyone is standing about an arms length apart, eyes flitting between the staff double door and the other customers. 

The doors opened and 3 large chaps in Tesco gear emerged wheeling a pile of baskets 6 foot high. The second they came into view people started surrounding them. They were trying to unload the goods to the stands, but the press of people wouldn't allow them. The baskets were mostly strawberries again, though there were other things like melon, all at 5p.

The woman we saw before with the 20 punnets was right in the centre, grabbing armfuls of yet more strawberries to add to her towering pile. Me and the missus waited patiently behind the group, partially for our own safety and partially because we weren't bloody animals.

There were heroes amongst them, too. A valiant woman who passed us things taken at random, which we accepted gladly. We left with 2 punnets of strawberrys and a pot of melon pieces.

The thing that got to me is that there are people, myself included, who are not well off. We have a strict budget, as we simply can't afford to go over it. We can't afford strawberries unless we splurge. Getting more than  a tiny amount was a treat! I know we're not alone, either. Strawberries are a luxury. We turned one of our punnets into a smoothie, and the other has remained frozen for when we want a treat.

I doubt the woman we saw with the 20+ punnets considered people in similar situations. 

We actually caught up with the hero later. She approached us and talked to us about how she comes there regularly, and how she's had elbows and baskets in the face.

From what I gather, it's not gigantically BT/Openreach's fault - a lot of the delays are due to suppliers overpromising on being able to deliver everything to an aggressive timescale.

The installs themselves are contracted out, and then subcontracted further. So when cockups are made (and they are), there's then lots of digging that needs to be done and reports to make up and down the chains. Plus, the installs are done at data centres with high security, which require organising one-off clearance for each install, so in the event of a cock up it takes even longer to fix as there's a second round of arranging access, getting credentials cleared etc...

*Incorrect legal criteria: As part of setting their investigative priorities in 2006, the Met consulted with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to agree upon a strategy for pursuing the Royal Household/Goodman inquiry.

So the CPS was at one stage saying it was only illegal if the message had not been listened too.  That's pretty far from all phone hacking being illegal.

Coulson's still a fairly unpleasant individual but if the CPS were issuing such a mixed message when phone hacking initially became a thing it would have been perfectly possible to be unclear of the legality of what might have been done.  Would they have known if their private investigator listened to the messages before they had been listened to by the intended recipient?

We overrate Charlie Austin.
That's not to say he's not vitally important to us. In fact, his importance to us (because until Zamora turned up towards the end of last season he was our only functioning striker) is part of his over-valuation. We needed him, like a needy girlfriend clings to an average bloke. On top of that, he's so clearly a down-to-earth and amiable guy that the fans get a bit misty-eyed about 'our Charlie'. He's an old-fashioned footballer, one of us, the kind of player that's been in short supply over the past decade as our squad has been stocked and restocked with foreign loanees. Even down to his name - QPR have a predominantly local fan-base and are a community club - many of us have mates called Charlie and dads who drove Austins. The way he plays is the same, nothing fancy, just an honest number 9. 

To be clear, I share many of these feelings, have sung his name week-in-week-out and missed him in the months when he was injured. He's one of my favourite players. I would love it if he took the PL by storm. But my unpopular opinion is that almost none of the admiration (or even adoration) is based on footballing reasons. Take the emotion out of it and he's a good, functional Championship striker.

The shop assistants used to price the food right there before putting it on the shelf, but couldn't put up with people snatching it out of their hands and pushing them into the aisle. The last time I went to help with my parents, they reduced the whole lot (ten crates or so) out in the stock room, then cautiously wheeled it in with security guards around it and dumped them by the shelf before running off. Fucking chaos ensued- people fighting to get in front of each other, trying to get to the bottom crates with people still rummaging through the top ones and chucking them aside, grabbing whatever they could (and then putting things back once they could grab no more and had time to sort). I ended up shouting at a guy because he dropped a crate on my foot, and he wasn't apologetic. I wasn't even participating in the clusterfuck, just standing nearby.

Definitely 2 new good strikers. 3 if Zamora doesn't sign up (I believe he's over his injury, but will last probably 60 mins a game now).

So really we are looking at 7 new players IMO. Sounds like a lot but we have just let a load go. Hope we get moving soon.

But if you think about it. Remy+Taarabt+Granero+Ceasar = £20 million to £25 million for new players. Could get 7 decent players for that plus a bit more.

The big exception to this is when you can't afford where you live.

The longer term trend for housing is going to be upwards because the UK population - particularly in metropolitan areas and the South East - is increasing, but housebuilding isn't keeping pace. Demand and supply, whether you've got in at the cycle peak or not the long term trend is upwards.

Additionally, we don't tend to see big drops in selling prices in a downmarket, what tends to happen is homeowners don't sell.

true,sm9t8,eng-somerset,Somerset,"&gt;but eurosceptics don't seem to just want the UK to remain outside of the core EU; they don't want Core -EU to exist.

Seriously? Most Eurosceptics I know either want Britain out of the EU, or a membership status that leaves us out of EU integration.

&gt;There's a hope/expectation that it will collapse.

Hope and expectation are two very different things. The only time I've known euro-sceptics to hope the EU collapses, is when its seen as the way for Britain to leave the EU. Otherwise most are quite happy for the continent to go down the route of federalisation.

The expectation that the EU will collapse is more common. The Euro's still having a hard time, there's still lots of resentment over the forced budgetary policies, and these problems will only grow the more power is centralised and taken further away from people.

Despite this I hope that if there's a democratic mandate, that a United States of Europe is created and flourishes, but I want Britain to be like Canada.",0,1404298601,null,0,false,0,cimin45,t3_29mpm0,t1_cimin45,t1_cimi7rn,null,1434512878,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

If you're one of those people where a job is a means to an end, to facilitate you spending time with family and community (e.g. you're happy working at your local shop for minimum wage because it lets you do what you want to do in your local community) then this suggestion is a bad idea. As pointed out, it would mean people have to move away from family and community, potentially through no fault of their own due to house prices and cost of living outstripping minimum wage and wage increases.

If you're one of those people where work is your life, and you go where work takes you, then this solution is obvious and not so much of a problem (probably more of the younger population who see e.g. moving away for uni as the norm).

Personally, I've moved around the UK a reasonable amount. My life is my work, my colleagues and the Web  are my peers and community. But I can see how people would take issue to the statement of move to Manchester: the issue is cost of living, house prices, job availability in and around London. Saying ""well just move away"" may solve the problem, but the people suffering are those who are effectively forced to leave their community due to economic cock ups by higher powers.

Some would argue people shouldn't have to move to the other end of the country just to be able to live. Whether intentional or not - the statement also has a far bigger impact and applicability to the lower classes.

So I don't think it's a terrible idea, but I can see how people would be against it.

true,mmmmmh,null,null,"&gt; The meaning of the word clearly hasn't changed though.

It still means inception as in start point. But it's been expanded (so it's changed, but still includes it's orginal meaning, like the word ""gay"" still to some holds it's original meaning of happy but means homosexual to others.) Somebody said Inception, lots of people understood that it meant layers. How is that NOT language or and expansion of a definition?

&gt; You can't fit the many-levels interpretation of the word into a normal sentence.

""Arguception"" comment above, for example, is short for ""this situation could be called Arguception"" or ""Arguception is appropriate to describe this situation"". Even if we remove all mentions of the word ""Inception"", most people would still understand what the Arguception comment was referring to. So in some way, you're right, it's not the word ""Inception"" it's more the appending of ""ception"" that adds or changes meaning (much like prepend e.g. ""dis"" or ""de"" changes meaning to undo or reverse)

&gt; You can only exclaim ""inception"" to make that reference, like saying ""directed by M Night Shyamalan"" refers to plot twists.

That's basically what language is: an accepted way of referencing ideas, objects and concepts for the purpose of communication.

When I say the word ""apple"" I'm making a reference to that edible fruit. The same way as when a person says the word Hoover, they're referencing the idea of a vacuum cleaner (as a result of the brand called Hoover.)

The fact that when somebody mentioned Inception and other people knew that person was referencing the concept of layers (albeit as a result of the film) suggests  that Inception is a commonly accepted way to refer to a concept of layers, AKA it's part of (a?) language. 

The fact that people wouldn't understand that reference before the film came out supports my original statement that language changes.",0,1404301439,null,0,false,0,cimj797,t3_29jrrm,t1_cimj797,t1_cilu64h,null,1434513349,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I would do all the reducing in this position then when waiting behind the cage and at the end quickly chuck it all into the reduced section and then rush away - you know when you throw a slice of bread to a group of birds at the park and they all rush in at once?

true,JohnShit,eng-wiltshire,Wiltshire,"&gt;No. It's my original analogy (""Is that red fruit there an apple""). Do try to keep up.  

When I said ""we don't know that the apple is red"", I was indicating that within the framework of your own analogy, you were wrong to say that the apple was red. For the apple situation to be analogous to Rebekah Brooks's statement, it being necessary to establish that her statement was material (i.e. that there was a course that the proceedings might have taken which might have led to a different outcome), you would have to have said that ""the apple is of an as-yet unestablished colour"", or to put it another way ""we do not know that the apple is red"". Now read the rest of the paragraph in context. Care to re-examine who's failing to keep up?

&gt;Do you mean like ""And to bring it back to the discussion, we've established (as I explained) that claiming guilt of a crime you didn't commit can clearly be material to a trial.""?  

That doesn't bring it back to the discussion, because Rebekah Brooks wasn't on trial. That brings it sideways from one of your unworkable analogies to another unworkable analogy, which is what I said, though you chose to believe instead that I was flailing or missing the point. Now bring it back to the discussion at hand - a select committee hearing.

&gt;No you're not. The discussion was about whether admitting to a crime you didn't commit can be ""material"" and that trial demonstrates clearly that it can. The fact that Brookes wasn't in a trial isn't relevant to that particular claim - like I say, it's relevant to the wider question of whether it's actually perjury, but that wasn't the thing I was discussing.

Yes I am. The discussion on my part was about what *does* (not ""can but might not"") make something material and whether that applies to Rebekah Brooks's statement. You might have noticed that I've been steering clear of your analogies and irrelevant digressions for the most part, and this is another one. To be clear: it makes no difference whether a type of statement *can* under some circumstances be material if those circumstances are not present. And they aren't, because this isn't a trial and her statement wasn't a plea.

To be clear...

&gt;So what we are showing is that pleading guilty to a crime you didn't commit might affect the outcome. And we've already established that whether the outcome was actually affected is irrelevant - it's whether it might affect it. I'm not sure what you're not following.

Firstly, pleading guilty to a crime that you didn't commit might affect the outcome *of a trial* that was specifically set up to ascertain your guilt of that crime; it can only do so because of its relationship to the possible outcomes available in those proceedings. Secondly, Vicky Pryce's lie did affect the outcome, so it isn't necessary to ask whether it might affect the outcome. If you want to examine the correct way to identify red apples, don't bring green apples.

&gt;Oh right. So I've ignored the ""If you want to be an arse about it,"", the ""Oh please. "", the ""Do you see how this is a massive waste of time? "", the ""Misunderstanding or just not reading -"" etc, etc.  

&gt;Yes first time I make a slightly disparaging remark and you suddenly get all defensive? Grow up, please.  

First time? The first time you were rude and hostile was in the first sentence of your second reply, before I said anything that was even slightly ratty:

""You're saying that as if it doesn't entirely invalidate your original point.""

What I'd actually said was:

""Yes and no, actually. The relevant part of the Act is '...a statement which is material for that purpose...""', but it looks like my explanation was a little off.""

""Yes"" because your comment, which I was replying to, had given no indication that you'd noticed the important part about materiality and so I wanted to flag that up, it being a large part of the reason for my original comment. ""No"" because I'd made a mistake by defining materiality too narrowly. When I went on to use my original comment as the starting point to clarify the reality, rather than approaching the discussion productively, you decided to continually hector me that it was ""entirely irrelevant"" and that I was somehow being hubristic by even bringing it back up. It isn't irrelevant. It is, in fact, the historical basis for determining materiality from which the modern basis developed, with the modern basis only being confirmed by binding precedent in 1985. It is still the simplest way to establish materiality in any case where it applies, with the more complicated question of whether the statement *might* have affected the outcome only needing to be asked if the simpler test is not passed. It is also, incidentally, the basis that Richard Tucker QC built the case for the appeal on in Millward.

As you can see, it is very relevant in a number of ways, but apparently you decided that I must just be bringing it up because I didn't want to admit that I was wrong, even though I reiterated that I was wrong numerous times because apparently once wasn't enough for you to stop claiming otherwise.

Don't act like you were polite now. If I had clung as obsessively to your mistakes as you have to mine, this conversation would have got absolutely nowhere. Your approach to discussion was hostile and niggling from the start, and all around the least pleasant I've come across in some time, and I'm on the fucking internet.

Since you're accusing me of ""flailing"" - despite having done the legwork to find the sources for your claims as well as my own (you never did read Millward, did you?), despite you not appearing to have an understanding of things that are quite fundamental to the discussion such as precedent, and despite you being the one who's spent the entire discussion swanning off on tangential analogies that took far more work to bend towards the slightest semblance of relevance than it would have taken to stick to the subject - I'll go back to your previous post and point out the other two or three ways that you missed the point (N.B. it is not flailing just because you didn't understand it) in the two or three attempts you made at it.

&gt;Now, that is a relevant point - an immediate retraction may well have an impact on whether it's perjury or not. **But again, that's not what you were claiming in your original post.** You seem to be missing the point of my argument, which may be why you are thrashing round in your responses. My point wasn't at any point that she is guilty of perjury - it's that whether a statement actually influences the verdict or not is irrelevant - it's whether in the minds of reasonable people, it could do. And my current problem is that, despite agreeing several times that your statement was wrong, you then go on to act (as with the previous comment about Pryce's trial) as if it is relevant.  

I've already touched on this and explained why it is still relevant to consider first whether a false statement actually did affect the outcome of the proceedings in question. If it did, then nothing more needs to be asked about its materiality - not whether it might have affected the outcome or anything else. That is the case with Pryce, and that's the first point.

Secondly, if Pryce made exactly the same statement in different proceedings - say, in a select committee hearing that was not set up to determine who had been driving her husband's car - then the statement would not have been material on that basis. Would it still have been material on the more nuanced basis that it might have affected the outcome? To determine that, as with all statements, the prosecution would have to prove that, having regard to all the circumstances, there was a plausible course that the proceedings might have taken but for the statement which might have led to a different outcome.

The question is not whether a particular statement *can* be material. The question is whether it *is* material *to those specific proceedings*. ""I like carrots"" could be material under the right circumstances. So what? That doesn't give ""I like carrots"" special properties as a statement or make it of a special kind that *can* be material. All statements can. Any statement can.

I've highlighted you saying yet again that it isn't what I was claiming in my original post. Shall I say yet again that I'm not actually trying to find a way to demonstrate the correctness of my original claim? I haven't been since my second post - my first reply to you - in which I voluntarily established that my definition of materiality had been wrong. You didn't drag that out of me. You didn't do anything to indicate that you'd even noticed the bit about materiality in the statute. I volunteered it, and continued the discussion on the basis that we were discussing the courts' true approach to materiality. To be clear, yet again: my original claim was wrong because I claimed that the statement would *only* be material under those circumstances; however, it is not irrelevant because that is is the first simple question that a court will consider to determine materiality, only then asking itself whether the statement might have influenced the outcome (a more complicated consideration) if materiality has not been established. If you were acting for the prosecution and the false statement had in fact affected the outcome, you would simply make that point as your proof of materiality and move on. Hence it is *relevant* to a discussion about what the true approach to materiality is but not *correct*.

There's research currently going on into antibacterial compounds and other mechanisms we can exploit (such as Toxin-Antitoxin Systems: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin-antitoxin_system) but it's not enough. 

We need a big push to start researching into new compounds again whilst these new potential methods are explored further which isn't currently happening - new antibiotics are notoriously expensive to research and have a very high failure rate in trials.

true,backtowriting,null,null,"Here's an example.  Yesterday's story regarding France's ban on the veil.  The Guardian immediately commissioned a piece putting the side of the veil wearers to explain that they aren't harming anyone and should be allowed to wear it.

Fair enough - but that's only one side of the story. What about those who feel intimidated by the veil?  What about those who think it represses women or those who think it's a security threat?  

&gt;What facts in particular? Unless you're more specific about what you consider to be facts, it's hard to know how to respond.

Unless you know of any academic studies it is going to be pretty hard to produce quality evidence showing a systematic bias.  However, the OP's claims are to my mind eminently credible and deserving of consideration.

&gt;I think most Guardian contributors/readers would reject the idea that there is a specific problem with Islam/Muslims in British society.

Really?  Read the comments on Guardian articles about Islam and you'll see that there's actually a diversity of opinion about Muslims and Islam in society.  A diversity which is not reflected in the commissioned pieces.

&gt;There's a lot of casual Islamophobia in the media

Possibly quite true, but the Guardian also constantly conflates reasonable criticism of Islam with bigotry.  The fact that some bigots hate Islam is not an argument *for* Islam or an argument against criticizing that ideology.

Also -  I hate the word 'Islamophobia'.  To my mind there is absolutely *no* criticism of the ideology of Islam which could even in principle be bigoted.  Bigotry applies to people not ideas.

What I am trying to establish is that by spending money on the people impllimenting a policy to make them efficient, effective and able to impliment the intended strategy well, you can minimise the costs significantly.

To refine your statement, I would suggest you cannot go to war hoping to save as many lives as possible while simultaneously reducing the training that your troops have recieved, abolishing peacekeepers and using regular soldiers in the aftermath of the conflict.

I fundamentally disagree with your conclusion. I believe you can cut welfare spending across the board and expect innocent people not to be significantly adversely affected. However, to do this, you would need a vast, effective and efficient bureauocracy with well thought out, planned strategies implimenting the policy quickly and effectively. These problems were due to incompetance in the make up of government, not purely the policy itself.

If you're going to be a high earner, you may well eventually pay off your loans in full, meaning you'll pay more for the money down the line. 

I'd take it, you can't know if you're going to need it, how much you're going to earn etc. If you're earning enough money down the line to pay the full amount, you probably won't care about the (comparably) tiddly amount of interest you've paid.

true,FeebleGimmick,null,null,"Thing is, food in this country does not equate to food in others. It's not possible, logistically or economically, to transport food from here to these countries suffering famine. Fresh goods would spoil en route, and for others, the money spent on transportation, far greater than the value of the food itself, would be better spent by giving it directly to the country and allowing them to buy in food locally, invest in irrigation etc. No-one seriously suggests actually transporting food.

Back to this country, people consume a specific calorific intake per day, which varies a bit from person to person, but is essentially not flexible. I know people who are into the ""freeganism"" thing (a.k.a. dumpser diving). But even when they eat something free, it means they're not eating what they would have otherwise eaten, so that food goes to waste instead. The same number of calories will always be wasted. 

So essentially it's a question of food quality. This is an important question, particularly if you look at the rubbish that they serve for school dinners, for example. How do we increase it? By driving down prices, so people can afford to buy better food. How do you drive down prices, when demand is constant? By increasing supply. Hence there will inevitably be more waste. But look at the benefits: getting back to the original topic, food that cannot be sold gets massively reduced in price, which is why the people in the picture are queuing up for it.

I guess I am basically unconvinced that food waste is inherently a bad thing. We have apple and plum trees in our garden, and 90% of their fruits are wasted every year. We have more than we know what to do with. So does everyone else in the village. We could avoid food waste entirely by cutting the trees down, but clearly, that's a dumb solution. In this case, I don't think there is a problem to be solved.

Food isn't particularly energy intensive (basically solar powered), is entirely sustainable, and I think we're better off producing more of it. The only way to reduce waste overall, is to produce less. The problem for me comes with non-biodegradable packaging.

&gt; The complaint was lodged on Wednesday with the U.K.'s Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT), a court that can investigate complaints about any alleged conduct by, or on behalf of, the British intelligence services.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigatory_Powers_Tribunal

&gt;  Investigatory Powers Tribunal is a judicial body, independent of the British Government, which hears complaints about surveillance by public bodies. The Tribunal was established in 2000 by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, and replaced the Interception of Communications Tribunal, the Security Service Tribunal, and the Intelligence Services Tribunal. The IPT does not disclose its address. It uses a PO Box in Nine Elms, London, close to the Secret Intelligence Building. Its website was created in 2003 by Tricorn Media Ltd which has worked extensively for the police and Home Office.

That's the tricky bit. It's hard to think of a restriction that would make them safer, it's not as if they're driving high-performance cars or struggling with motorway speeds. Generally young drivers know how they're supposed to drive (so extra training wouldn't help), but lots of them just don't want to drive 'like an old woman'.

The article talks about restricting the hours they can drive, or the number of friends they can carry, presumably because they think young people are most likely to be reckless when out with a car load of friends in the evening, but it's hardly tackling the root cause.

I think there's almost nothing the government can do, but insurers have made a start with data recorders that track aggressive driving and adjust your insurance premium to match.

You sold van Persie to United and then finished the following season with more points.

He was by far your best player and then he went and won United the league.

Without him would they have won it? Who the fuck knows? They would have had a different striker who may or may not have banged in the goals. They would have played differently without him.

Arsenal would obviously not have the same points without van Persie, but they finished with more points the following season.

It's hypothetical nonsense to say Liverpool would finish with less points without Suarez.

Who the fuck knows? You certainly don't.

You've been answered in a number of different ways saying the same thing... Who knows? Yet you're insisting that without Suarez Liverpool would be a worse ""team"".

No they fucking wouldn't. just like Arsenal weren't a worse team without their star player.

One of the greatest managers the league has ever seen found a way to survive without van Persie, because that's what teams do.

They find replacements. They change their style, they adapt and they move on.

Arsenal have shown over the years that selling your best players doesn't mean that you suddenly drop a load of points (an arbitrary 10 points seems to be what you're going for here).

Yet as a fan of that club you're saying that us selling our best player would result in exactly the opposite of what Arsenal have done, adapt.

I'm not saying Rodgers is as good a manager as Wenger, Liverpool may not adapt as well to losing Suarez. But what I am saying is that you're talking utter, utter horse-shit.

Our midfield, Sterling, Henderson, Coutinho, Captain Gerrard and now Lallana and hopefully Shaqiri in the coming days, will play a major role in the playmaking and even goal scoring campaign next season. 

To be completely honest, I'm slightly afraid of how we'll do without Suárez next season. It was undeniable that he ""carried"" us to some extent, in the attacking half, insane amount of goals for us, and it'll be hard to see him leave, should he choose Barcelona.

true,_njd_,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"Okay.

I've worked in the private sector for many years; then for a few years I was in the civil service, working in IT. Right around the time when the financial crisis hit.
 
I got a nice generous public sector pension, worth nearly £4,000 a year; but that was about the size of the pay cut I took. So it worked out about the same, except _that_ part of my pay I couldn't actually spend every month, because it was locked up in a pension until I'm _old_.

So whatever people might have heard about outrageously cushy pensions, mine just about compensated for the extra amount I _could_ have been earning in the private sector. It just about covered the shortfall.

Because I was in the civil service (and not, say, the banking industry) my pay got frozen for two years, then rises were capped at 1%.  
The cost of living has gone up quite a lot in the last few years – look at rising food prices, fuel prices, even house prices.

So my pay went down in real terms. But at least I had my pension, right? Well at the same time, the Government was talking about making the pension smaller and extending the retirement age to 67, 69, who knows when. One year after another, there were rounds of staff cuts, appeals for voluntary redundancy (if you choose to leave, we might not have to force people) and so on.

There were people at the top of the organisation who were earning more than a Cabinet minister, maybe even more than the Prime Minister. But most of us were earning at or below the national average wage, and falling.

Many in the public sector take those jobs because they need flexible working, because they have kids or some elderly relative who needs their time, so they need to be able to come in late regularly, or leave early, or take the day off sometimes because someone at home is ill. They can't just find an equivalent job in the private sector (because most private sector employers are not that flexible), but they can't afford to keep having their pay squeezed like this.

And this is why they're striking.

Now I didn't strike, because I'm not convinced it changes anything – it inconveniences the wrong people and not the ones with the power to make more money available. I never even joined a union while I was there.

I've got IT skills which are transferable. So I just put up with it for a while and found another job in a sector that wasn't getting squeezed so much.

But it's not that easy for everyone. If you've spent two or three decades working in teaching or in local government, what's the alternative outside the public sector?  
Go work in a private school? Most teachers are ideologically opposed to that, can't stand the idea of working somewhere where only a privileged few can afford to send their kids. And the ones who can stomach it have to join a long queue.

If you look at any organisation with more than a few hundred staff, you'll find people at the top with six-figure salaries and huge pensions. Not just the public sector. And there will be people at the bottom earning sod all, and people in the middle who are pretty average. Most of them are not having it easy.

If you doubt what I've told you, go and ask the people who clean your streets or empty your bins, ask them about their cushy public sector benefits, then you'll discover what it's really like.

We've been extremely successful this transfer window in picking up multiple players, Can, Lallana and Lambert all successfully done and, by the looks of it, this guy.

This guy's been extremely shadowed, leaving us all wondering who in the world he is, all he has to prove is that he's capable - and Liverpool would be a great team to make a name for himself.

true,TimLeach,null,null,"&gt;Unless you know of any academic studies it is going to be pretty hard to produce quality evidence showing a systematic bias. However, the OP's claims are to my mind eminently credible and deserving of consideration.

This was less my trying to get him to back up his claims with stats, and more to see what exactly he was presenting as fact. There are plenty of people who misuse facts to prop up their prejudices, and I was trying to find out if OP was one of them. If his position is ""criticism of certain aspects of theological Islam are not being debated sufficiently in the Guardian"", that's one thing. Quite another is if he is saying ""Muslims are wife beaters and child molesters, why won't the Guardian talk about it like the Daily Mail does?""

&gt;Also - I hate the word 'Islamophobia'. To my mind there is absolutely no criticism of the ideology of Islam which could even in principle be bigoted. Bigotry applies to people not ideas.

Agree in principle. The problem is, the majority of people who practice that religion in the UK happen to have brown skin. Many of them dress differently, eat differently, speak a different language on the street. Islamophobia, I think, refers less to people critiquing the religion of Islam on theological/philosophical grounds, and more to people having a prejudice against Muslims which a new iteration of the time old ""fear of the alien."" So as a term it has its uses - it defines a kind of prejudice which has racial elements, but is not entirely racially specific.

I think it's fair to say, as you have elsewhere in this thread, that the Guardian *does* skew its coverage as a response to the way other media sources report certain topics (particularly feminist concerns, migration, etc). As I said ""There's a lot of casual Islamophobia in the media and in public attitudes, and the Guardian's position is a reaction against this."" so I think we're broadly in agreement on that.

I suppose I don't have *too* much of a problem with the Guardian's position, as I feel it is a relatively small voice going up against a largely right wing print media. There's plenty of other newspapers putting out anti-Muslim, anti-migrant, anti-EU, and anti-women reporting, and the Guardian is trying to correct the balance.

The worst thing that has ever happened to Everton is the monster that it helped bring about - the English Premier League

Before the days of huge TV coverage which has inflated the importance of meaningless events like a throw in being given the wrong way, Everton were one of the traditional giants of English football.

The club that had the first EVER number 9 (in a cup final no less). The first English club with dug outs,  flood lights or a purpose built stadium. The club with the highest scorer in a single English football season ever (William ""Dixie"" Ralph Dean with 60 goals in case you don't know) 

The only English club to ever host a semi final of a world cup. A club that has broken transfer records again and again and again.

A club that has more cumulative top flight seasons than EVERYONE else in the world. 

I could go on, and if I am asked I will, but Everton Football Club is the greatest institutional I have ever had the fortune to be part of.

Instead, restrict power to kerb weight ratio. This directly restricts acceleration etc, and indirectly rules out both big engines, and little engines with big turbos. You could go further, and limit total power, too; this means that someone in a light car (easier to stop) gets more acceleration than a big heavy lump.

If I were doing it, I'd set the limits somewhere around 50 kW/tonne (50 W/kg if you prefer), maximum 100 kW; this lets you drive a big car that's been restricted (even a Skoda Octavia is too powerful to meet this - at 1.1t kerb weight, it would be allowed 55 kW or 75 PS, which is lower than the 105 PS of the basic Octavia), drive a van if you really need the size (limited to 100 kW for the really big vans, as they exceed 2t kerb weight, but you can get Transits with that little power, even XLB Transits) or have fun in a little car (a Ford Ka would be fine, even if you tweaked the engine for a little more performance, as would the 1.0 Fiesta and some of the 1.25 Fiestas).",0,1404312236,null,0,false,0,cimmsnu,t3_29nac9,t1_cimmsnu,t1_cimlfzt,null,1434515327,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

If you ask me why we are going to sign Max? Well from Origi possibly transfer, maybe we are starting to pull Chelsea trick in market which is to buy undervalued player and sell him back with a higher price. If he perform he stays, if not he's sold so no risk at all in buying undervalued player.

true,jimmithy,null,null,"**Keeper**: Fabianski. I assume Vorm is off? Tremmel has shown he can do a good job when needed.

**Right Back**: I like Rangel but he's getting on. I've always been vocal about my displeasure with Tiendalli, not sure Jazz is ready for the step up. 

**Centre Back**: Williams and Bartley/Amat. I like Chico but I'm guessing that he may be too much trouble for Monk. Possible: Bringing Caulker back from the depths of the Championship to reunite him in white with Williams.

**Left Back**: Guessing Davies is gone, so Taylor. He looked suspect a few times when he featured last season, hopefully with some match practice he'll get back to where he was before. Kingsley as a capable backup.

**Defensive Midfield**: I think we would be asking a lot of Leon to fill that roll all season. Shelvey definitely gets the nod though. Ki coming back would be good, I thought he had a top season at Sunderland. Fulton will probably get a good few games.

**Attacking Midfield**: Hernandez centrally was fantastic at times last season. Shelvey can be pushed up. Emnes offered us something different. I think it would be great to bring Sigurðsson back. Thinking Michu is off, [which I don't think is the worst decision ever](http://www.reddit.com/r/swanseacity/comments/25acdm/well_thats_the_end_of_this_season/chfoibb).

**Wide Midfield**: Routledge, Dyer. Hernandez can play here too. I am a little surprised that we haven't been linked with more players in this position. Playing DeGuzman here worked for the most part. I think we need to strengthen this position.


**Up Top**: Bony first. Gomis will get games for sure. Would be nice to see Donnelly on the bench, would be nicer to see Borini back.

true,TimLeach,null,null,"&gt;I'm against prejudice against Muslims, but I have no problem with criticizing Islam. We have to be very careful to separate out the people from the ideology.

Absolutely. The danger is how easily one can bleed into another. 

Have you read the Orwell essay [Antisemitism in Britain](http://theorwellprize.co.uk/george-orwell/by-orwell/essays-and-other-works/antisemitism-in-britain/)? It's a great essay on the nature of prejudice, and the key takeaway from me is the number of people Orwell talks to who express clear anti-semitic beliefs, but do not identify as anti-semites, who find an evidence based (usually anecdotal) rationalisation for an irrational prejudice. 

From the essay: ""The Jews are accused of specific offences (for instance, bad behaviour in food queues) which the person speaking feels strongly about, but it is obvious that these accusations merely rationalize some deep-rooted prejudice. To attempt to counter them with facts and statistics is useless, and may sometimes be worse than useless. As the last of the above-quoted remarks shows, people can remain antisemitic, or at least anti-Jewish, while being fully aware that their outlook is indefensible. If you dislike somebody, you dislike him and there is an end of it: your feelings are not made any better by a recital of his virtues.""

My concern with critiques of Islam is that often the people putting them forward *present* them as being critiques of a religion, when they are *really* a critique of a group of people as a good old fashioned scapegoat for societies ills, a role that has been filled by many, many different groups before and will be in the future.

Absolutely not saying this is what you are doing - rather, that it was my concern that OP may be doing this, and why perhaps papers like the Guardian shy away from publishing such articles in the current climate of anti-Muslim feeling.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; Have a nationalised pharma company?

Why stop at a single country?  Why not have a globalised pharma company?

Bayer (to pick a company at random) has a market capitalisation of €86 billion.  That's what it would cost (theoretically) if you went and bought all the shares today on the open market.  You could start up your own pharma company for considerably less, I'm sure, but let's pick one that's already up and running to see how the figures stack up.

If the top 20 or so richest nations donated a few billion each they could collectively buy a pharma company like Bayer and turn it into a non-profit company that sold its drugs back to its stakeholders at cost price.  The company would still make money (revenue), employ lots of people, research new drugs and so on, but the bottom line profit (€3.5 billion last year) would be reduced to zero.   

Now the NHS spends around €12 billion a year on drugs so a one-off investment of, say €3 billion (25% of the NHS drugs budget, 2.5% of the overall NHS budget) in return for cheaper drugs now and forever more is not only feasible, but seems to make good financial sense.

The interesting thing is that this doesn't require nationalisation (or globalisation) of an industry which, to be honest, is only likely to happen after a communist/socialist revolution and I'm not holding my breath waiting for that.  Rather, it exploits the existing capitalistic system whereby a sufficiently rich investor can buy up enough stock on the open market to gain a controlling interest in a company.

Though I agree with you that some reform is needed. The MPS has made a lot of improvements over the past few decades but it's clear there are still some rotten elements within it and weeding these out isn't going to be easy. Maybe it would help to split it up into smaller regional forces - not a sensible idea for the densely populated inner london boroughs, but the outer boroughs that are pretty self-reliant could get away with it. However the trend today seems to be to combine territorial police forces into larger regional forces - eg the creation of a single Scottish police force and plans to do the same in Wales in 2006. I think the chief constable of the MPS said he would prefer there to be only one police force active in London (currently there are four).

I think a good idea, and one that could be easily implemented, would be to downsize the Met a bit and make its status equal to that of other territorial police forces by taking some functions away from it. Currently it's seen as a bigger, more senior force because of some national-level functions it carries out, such as using its resources to investigate terrorism and organised crime elsewhere in the country and providing close protection to royals, politicians and diplomats.

But you've got it a bit wrong. The STOVL version is the F-35B, so it works like the old Harriers did. F-35C is the version that is meant for aircraft carriers: its wings fold up and has a hook etc. to work with  cats and traps.

We are not getting F-35C aircraft. The original plan by Labour was to buy F-35B, which is the STOVL version, so HMS Queen Elizabeth would work just like our old carriers worked, with planes taking off a ramp then landing vertically using the big fan shafts. 

The coalition in their 2010 defence review switched to the F-35C because they said it would be cheaper, but this would have meant converting the carriers to cats and traps (F-35C can't do vertical landing). In 2012 they changed their mind again and reverted back to the F-35B because it was too expensive to change the design of the aircraft carriers. The RAF and Royal Navy are getting F-35B, not F-35C.

Examples of all three variants have been built and have been flown.

I would strongly disagree with this actually, but of course I was reducing London's charms for comic effect.

I think one of the great annoyances in this country is how all the diverse, exciting and innovative ideas (especially in the arts) that happen outside of London get completely ignored. For example, Liverpool has:

* A staggering collection of museums and galleries, including ancient [Tudor mansions](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/speke-hall/) and [world-class exhibition spaces](http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/index.aspx)
* An enormous combination [Pride-cum-arts-festival](http://www.homotopia.net/) every year
* The greatest collection of listed buildings outside of London, including some of the finest art deco buildings in the country.
* A vibrant music scene supported by dozens of independent music venues and larger arenas, with major music festivals including the largest free one in Europe
* [Beautiful beaches](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/cs/Satellite?blobcol=urldata&amp;blobheader=image%2Fjpeg&amp;blobheadername1=Content-Disposition&amp;blobheadername2=MDT-Type&amp;blobheadername3=Content-Type&amp;blobheadervalue1=inline%3B+filename%3D166%252F37%252Fformby_dunesandbeach_thumb_460x0%252C0.jpg&amp;blobheadervalue2=abinary%3B+charset%3DUTF-8&amp;blobheadervalue3=image%2Fjpeg&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs&amp;blobwhere=1349117421639&amp;ssbinary=true) and stunning natural scenery 
* Parks everywhere, including the basis for Central Park in New York City. Almost a third of the city is green space
* The oldest Chinese community in Europe, with some pretty excellent New Year celebrations
* A huge and varied dramatic scene, including the legendary Everyman which launched the careers of a bunch of famous actors including Pete Postlethwaite and David Morrissey 
* A ton of sporting events that go beyond the two Premiership teams, including golf, horse racing and more
* The Liverpool biennial arts festival, which is spectacular every two years and spills out into tons of other artistic stuff.

I've had a quick read of Nutmeg's site and it looks kinda like a halfway house between a passive fund-of-funds and an active fund-of-funds. Do they specify exactly what they will invest in and what indices they track, or could that change over time?

In don't think comparing the cost to extra performance is the right way to think about it - on average, you're not likely to get extra performance. What you might get is better diversification - it looks like Nutmeg invests in property and commodities-specific sectors, which LS doesn't do (except in as much as they're represented in general share indices). You could also consider tracking error, though I'd hope it'd be small in both cases, and how much you're paying above the underlying cost of the included investments/funds. (For example, emerging markets index funds tend to cost more than, say, FTSE100 or S&amp;P500 index funds, so if there's a higher proportion of emerging markets investments you'd expect the cost to be higher.)

The extra fee looks like a lot to me - 1% per year compounds pretty quickly. I'm mostly in an LS fund through iWeb, for a £25 setup fee, plus £5 per trade with no custody fee (percentage) for the platform. So if you have a fair amount to invest you can get the cost down to closer to the fund cost of 0.29% - it should cost me rather less than the 0.45% you suggest as a ball-park. I've added a global property index fund to that for a little extra diversification. That probably isn't as diversified as Nutmeg but the cost is much lower.

My *feeling* is that if you're willing to do some of the research and thinking yourself then using an LS fund as a core and perhaps adding a couple of other smaller investments for more diversification is probably a better bet.",0,1404315175,null,0,false,0,cimo647,t3_29n8hc,t1_cimo647,t3_29n8hc,null,1434516179,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2

Now of course the EU more than likely wont be as hostile as China is to Japan but they are certainly going to exert their influence in their favour. 

The only reason Japan is able to stand up to China is because it has the US firmly on its side. When it comes to the UK and the EU the US isn't going to be on our side, they won't care.

As I have said elsewhere, this subreddit is fantastic for discussion. I have had plenty of very interesting and informative discussions in the past that have been very heated and passionate, but all sides have taken something from it- as well considered opinions are being put across.

If you look at this thread, can you find a well considered opinion (like yours) that disagrees with what I said? Even so, the downvote arrow is not for disagreeing, and (as others have said in this thread) they have never seen a comment downvoted as much as the one up there. So, there is a significant change in behavior on the subreddit since the World Cup, so the evidence that it is bandwagon fans has nothing to do with people disagreeing. 

&gt; It that long enough to have an opinion? I'd say that Howard does most of his work before the ball even enters the box

I have said the same thing in this thread, in a reply to someone asking why Lloris is so highly rated.

&gt;Certainly people can claim him on a top of the top list if they want.

Of course they can, and I am very willing to listen to peoples justification for that- however it is very difficult to open dialogue with anonymous downvoters. 

&gt; To say that other people just aren't as real as you and so are wrong is the mark of a crap ass fan that does our side no good

I didn't say that. I was replying to 'why has this been downvoted so much' when I said about bandwagon fans. I have no problem with people disagreeing- but I do have a problem with people downvoting opinions and not discussing the topic at hand, which is what I said.

'No, not really.'

'So what's it like.'

'It's actually on a council estate'

I predict Courtois to at least match Cech's consistency. He might even surpass Cech. He's better now than Cech was at 22.

A Ford Sierra from the early 80s (like the one my parents let me drive when I was a newly qualified driver) would typically have around 75 PS, unless you bought a sporty version.

And under 10 years ago, I was driving an early 90s Astra Estate; the car had the 58 PS diesel, and had a kerb weight of 1105 kg - slightly heavier than the Octavia. Getting out of junctions and merging was not a problem; I had to think about what I was doing and plan ahead, but that's part of driving skills generally.

The advantage of having spent significant time in low powered cars compared to my current 170 PS beasty is that I'm used to planning a long way ahead, and not having the power there to get me out of trouble if I misjudge.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;The premise I discussed is an agreement the big companies have with each other. So its tough to avoid.

Indeed, but it's too dissimilar to a social networking site to say 'this works for them, don't complain that FB do the same'.

&gt; you merely have to ask if your morals are worth more than the convenience it offers.

It's insulting to reduce it to a moral responsibility when there is no choice, because it's not nearly that simple - sorry Ma, I'm not going to post that video on FB for you because I don't like their practices' - why not force them to *not* follow those practices? It's not like they're on the verge of going broke....you may as well state that by using money you've *chosen* to be a capitalist and that anything done with it by others is your responsibility. It's not my fault if you've got no other option but to use it (etc. etc.).

&gt; Do you just go to the nearby Toy store or seek out one not tainted niche one?

If we're going to follow the parallel, you're asking why one couldn't visit a different toy store that doesn't stock any toys.

&gt;Oh your mother will only go to the big toy shop? Well it looks like I already have your answer.

I'd suggest it's actually an answer for *you* in terms of demonstrating why 'well, go elsewhere' doesn't work. There *isn't* another FB - if you can suggest a site that interacts with FB in the same way and is so easy my Mum (etc.) could set it up, and you have a way to get *all* the people I'm FB-friends with to do so, I'm all ears - but google have already tried this and failed...so until FB are forced to open up their site to allow *other* social networking sites to interact, it's going to stay that way.

&gt;I'd hope it helps demonstrate my revulsion with marketing practices.

I too find marketing practices quite loathsome, but it's the difference between many toy shops and the one (and arguably, only) social networking site that has people up in arms. I would also point out that I don't agree with toy store marketing practices either - if I don't find those acceptable, why should I do so with FB?

It would have been heaps smarter to create decent a solution to reduce the bus jam that occurs every day there.

I know I'm not making friends with this thought because I'm bringing up the city's painful subject - but that is where the tram should have been going: from Leith to Newington or further south even. With proper bus interchanges on either end and a tram stop for the train station on North bridge. Plus a new ticket that allows for changing of services and is valid for a certain time period - that one is crucial for integrated transport. So that at least some of the 20 or so bus lines that try to squeeze through Waterloo Place all the time could take other routes and people would still get to the centre. What has been brought against the tram (it's bigger, so there'll be fewer services) would have worked well there because they would have been the same passenger capacity with less vehicles, making it less traffic.

Well, that's never going to happen I guess. So at least they could create a proper bus station on Princes Street. Having the amount of buses where other cities have giant bus stations trying to stop at a simple bus stop is like trying to fill a 5l bottle with a shot glass while elsewhere they use a pint glass. So just get rid of some of the marble ugliness on top of the half empty shopping centre and create a bus station with stopping bays and so on.

Also never going to happen - this is a city where they can't even design a normal pedestrian traffic light. That should be a beginners task at uni by the way: - draw a straight line across a road, add traffic lights at both ends and for people who are caught in the middle on red, just create an island. No, here they have to create those nice obstacle courses - 4m wide crossing and everyone has to squeeze through a 2m wide island with the traffic lights taking away another 20cm on each side because the planner was too drunk to draw a straight line...
Or the tripping stones on Princes Street at the new pedestrian crossings - do they just loathe pedestrians at the council or why do they come up with retarded things like that?

'Other people are doing it, so why can't we' isn't really good enough.

&gt;If people are worked up then perhaps they just don't get the spot where we already are?

What's legal and what people accept are two wildly different things. People don't accept advertising, which is one of the reasons piracy has been so prevalent in the past twenty years, and it's the 'well, you've already accepted it' logic that has made a single advert during a programme or on a DVD balloon into trailers, warnings, adverts, trailers, menu, warnings (and so on until you're asleep before the movie starts).

&gt;If they want to move around the aisles and the toys to see how that changes their customers perceptions they can.

That's a bad example. FB could 'move around' their ads on the page -that's very different to specifically editing the ads to change your mood.

&gt;Yes but its still a business with traffic.

Which already earns silly amounts of money. Playing psychological games with people in order to earn even yet still more money is unacceptable.

&gt;If they want to move around the aisles and the toys to see how that changes their customers perceptions they can.

And FB are free to move the ads around the page.

&gt;As I already made clear they've already made children cry on Christmas day for the purpose of selling product so that's nothing new.

Not sure why that makes it acceptable, or why just because nothing's been done about it the practice is allowed elsewhere.

&gt;The fact remains that if you want to avoid being the product on Facebook then look for alternatives, perhaps ones that are paid for?

There aren't any. For right now, it's too late.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"No it isn't crackers at all... Here's why:

* US Aircraft Carriers are nuclear powered. The catapults they use to launch aircraft use steam that is made during their nuclear power process. In this sense, they have a constantly available source of steam that is 'free' to use. 

* However the QE class carriers are diesel-electric, not nuclear. Why? Two reasons - firstly it's cheaper, secondly (*and more importantly*) the Royal Navy disagree with the US about the benefits of nuclear power on surface ships. It's not that we can't do it, we do after all have about a dozen nuclear powered submarines (though those reactors are tiny in comparison). We believe it makes sense to have nuclear power on submarines because they operate alone for long periods at a time. It means they are less limited by the need for regular resupply, and infact the Trident carrying SSBNs can operate for 6 months without ANY resupply. Aircraft carriers are a different bag though - they are designed to **only** operate as part of a large surface fleet because alone they do not have an anti-air or anti-submarine defense and are inherently vulnerable due to their size. These large fleets are made up entirely of diesel-electric ships, so in reality they lose many of the benefits nuclear power offers. In addition their relatively large crew-size makes regular resupply of consumables (like food) a necessity - whereas submarines can carry a lot of stores for their relatively small crews. 

* For the QE class carriers to operate a CATOBAR design they would need either 1) to fit a secondary steam generation system that would require its own generators in order to use a conventional steam catapult... this has many drawbacks as the QE class wasn't designed for it. OR 2) there is a prototype electromagnetic catapult system being developed in the USA... however, it is very ambitious and over-budget. It would also require a special US export license and our carrier would be the guinea pig for it. At the Strategic spending review the new Coalition decided to go for this options, however they then did their now famous U-turn because it turned out to be a big white-elephant.

* The US Navy is enshrined in its WW2 legacy of pacific island hopping in huge carrier fleets. 

* The Royal Navy has had more success with smaller limited carrier operations, and following some nasty blows in WW2 particularly in the pacific, recognizes that capital ships like carriers are tremendously vulnerable - even more so now in the days of anti-shipping missiles.

* partly these differences are due to economies of scale... the US has 12 nuclear carrier battle groups so servicing those reactors comes at a cheap unit-cost. The UK only plans to build two carriers so building the vast dedicated maintenance facilities to keep their reactors fueled would not be financially sensible in the long run for us. Above all, the Royal Navy do not agree that nuclear power makes good financial sense in a carrier as many of the advantages of nuclear power are lost on carriers. They do however think nuclear submarines are very effective and of course the first and possibly only nuclear powered ship to ever sink another ship in combat was HMS Conqueror during the Falklands war.

Basically: The RN believe carriers are about operational flexibility, the US believes they are about blue water power projection. In reality, both are probably right a certain extent although I honestly believe the UK view is sensible.

Thing is...

Trams are [42.8 metres long with a capacity of 332 passengers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Trams#Rolling_stock) (a mere 80 seated, and then 252 standing).

Bus (and I'll use the example of the hybrid double decker as used on the number 10 route) is [10.9 metres long, with 78 seats](http://www.alexander-dennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/e400h_spec_sheet.pdf).

So four number 10 buses are 43.6m in total, very close to the tram's length, with a capacity of 312 passengers between them.

So in a given amount of road space, the tram can carry about 6% more people, **if** it's full - although about 75% of its passengers have to stand, as opposed to all-seated on the buses.

And of course four buses have the flexibility of being able to serve four different routes...

&gt; So just get rid of some of the marble ugliness on top of the half empty shopping centre and create a bus station with stopping bays and so on.

While a nice idea in theory, I strongly doubt the roof of the shopping centre's been built with the capacity to take the weight of numerous fully laden buses - you'd probably be looking at a demolish and rebuild, a sadly non-trivial exercise.",0,1404325834,null,0,false,0,cimtpb0,t3_29n6dy,t1_cimtpb0,t1_cimry78,null,1434519299,3,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,3

Ad hominem!  Complete ad hominem!  

You're making a claim that the OP's quite sensible observation could have been made by a bigot even though there is absolutely *nothing* bigoted about the point he/she made.

There's not much difference between your central argument and the logic that because terrorists often express support for Islam then anyone who also expresses support for Islam could well be a terrorist sympathizer.

Don't like bigots?  Well, find some instance of them saying something which is actually bigoted and attack the hell of that.  But accusing people who have made quite sensible statements of bigotry is in itself prejudiced.

true,anagoge,null,null,"I'm pretty disappointed with Holi One.

I had booked my ticket all the way back in December last year and had been really looking forward to it. However, the day before the festival, they started sending out unsolicited mobile advertising. In addition to that, the advertising said that last entry was at 2pm, but nowhere on the ticket or website does it say that.

I wasn't planning to arrive before 2pm and so I needed to know if the 2pm cutoff point was correct or not. I emailed them as soon as I got the text. No answer. In fact, it's now the Wednesday after the event and still no answer.

In addition to that, it wasn't exactly the nicest weather so I wanted to know if it was still on at all. You would think that with an event that big, they'd be good at keeping their Facebook/Twitter pages up to date with more information but instead, it was lots of people asking the same question - ""Is this still going ahead? Please let me know!"". It took until 1:45pm for the organisers to post a message saying it was still on. That, plus the fact that they'd said last entry was 2pm, meant that I just decided to not bother going.

I looked for a phone number too. No phone number listed on their website.

Holi One are incredibly poor at providing communication with people even once they've bought a ticket. I wasn't asking for much. Just some clarification like everyone else.

With Shaqiri, Sterling, Sanchez, Lallana, Sturridge etc, we have many players who can score multiple goals a season. Okay so none will score 30 on their own, but we don't need them to. As I said in response to another comment here, lack of goalscoring wasn't our downfall last season. Don't forget we've also brought in Can who can play as a CM or DM, but often pops up around the box and can offer a few goals and assists per year.

&gt;With Suarez, we could play Henderson/Gerrard/Lucas because we don't need our midfield to be scoring goals

We always need our midfield scoring goals. I'd much rather have 7 or 8 goalscorers on a team scoring 6-10 goals a season than one guy scoring 30 and 4-5 others scoring a couple here and there.

As /u/robbiethegiant said, Henderson is a perfect example. His shooting isn't what I'd like it to be but it's getting better.

Many migrants also speak and read English and a lot of migrant children have it as their primary language, so I was seeing if you want them to be monolingual with English to fit into your ""homogenous community"" or if you're okay with them having other languages. You obviously are, if they're allowed a physical language so long as they can read and write English, so then migrants who can speak English fall into that category.

The reason I'm ""arguing over semantics"" and being nit-picky about this is to try to point out that there's no such thing as a homogenous community unless you set completely arbitrary boundaries for what counts as homogenous and what counts as a community.

What is a homogenous culture? Is it where everyone celebrates the same festivals? Or where everyone sings the same songs? Or where they eat the same food? Are we the same culturally as America? England? Is Belfast homogenous with Derry? Is West Belfast the same as East Belfast culturally? What about comparing the Ormeau Road to the Lisburn Road? How about numbers 20-60 of the Ormeau Road to 60-100? What about if 60-100 are almost completely Polish migrant families, but 20-60 are mainly Northern Irish - does each count as a separate community that is homogenous within itself or do they count as a heterogenous community because they're on the same road?

Yes this is all semantics, because I'm making the point that your statement has **absolutely zero weight** when you look at what it means, other than it promotes the idea that it's okay to be racist because it's ""human nature"" to want something that can't even be pinned down.",1,1404326592,null,0,false,0,cimu3hv,t3_29n3ep,t1_cimu3hv,t1_cimtrjl,null,1434519585,2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2

Because adults need to drive. They have work to go to, or university. Public transport is just not always optimal (I say this as a person who drove to Uni every day for undergraduate, and then used public transportation for postgrad). If we are going to expect people over a certain age to have responsibility, I think the benefits of being an adult should be there too, and one of those is the great freedom that driving provides.

For sure there is a problem with accidents caused by young drivers, but increasing the driving age is a lazy fix that I feel just doesn't take account of modern life. I never really found my own driving test to be a sufficient test of skill to be honest, and I certainly wouldn't be against making it more challenging (or limiting the engine size of cars for new drivers if that is deemed to be a factor in incidents). This would also be helpful regardless of whether we would see a decrease in fatalities if the driving age was raised.

I have no evidence but I do imagine that we would see a decrease in fatalities if the driving age were raised though.

Instead, they mostly just compare their returns against a combination of the FTSE all share, a UK government bond index and a world Ex-UK equity index.

http://www.nutmeg.com/how-we-invest/performance-faq#market-return

When you go into their portfolios, that's not what you see at all.

Picking a risk level of '8' with no timeframe, for example, gets you [a mix](http://i.imgur.com/jfTfZiN.png) that has a much higher ratio of small:large cap than the all-share index, and corporate bonds rather than government bonds, plus a disproportionate weighting towards Italian and Indonesian equities and a small amount of exposure to agriculture and property. Presumably, nutmeg will argue that the diversity in their portfolio means that has the same risk as the comparison [40% UK equity, 40% global equity, 20% UK government bonds 'market'](http://i.imgur.com/HxB3nJR.png), but it's far from obvious that this is the case - to me it just looks like a riskier version of the benchmark. [Comparing the benchmark (without fees)](http://i.imgur.com/xwRc82M.png) to their portfolio (with fees) shows that it hasn't even done particularly well - for the most part, it seems to hug the 'market' pretty closely or even lag behind, pulling ahead a bit in recent months. That seems to suggest that

 1: Their portfolio is basically pretty closely correlated with the simple 3-index benchmark

 2: You're taking on extra risk for the benefit of Nutmeg, not yourself - without fees, their small-cap and corporate bond heavy portfolio would do better than the whole market/government bonds mix, but you could also expect it to be riskier.

The Orange Tree is also a good pub, where North and South Sherwood streets intersect, if a little expensive. North Sherwood Street's also a pretty good place to live; cheap, and as safe as anywhere that close to the city centre. I lived there for two years and never had any bother anyway.

As for who has the stronger squad we are both very biased, even in regards to who we think the neutral would say is stronger. It is a futile argument which I shouldn't have brought up.

If you would like I can come back and remind you when the window closes and zero of Arsenal's key players have left. All are on long term deals which wasn't the case with our high profile departures, none are being underpaid like we have been guilty of in the past and like I said none have given even the slightest hint of wanting to leave nor has there been any credible reports of interest from other clubs.

Nowadays scarcity is pretty much imposed artificially so making sure everyone has the basics would be fairly trivial. 

Building or rebuilding community will be much harder. All sorts of factors are working against community, and many of them aren't going away: more women in the workforce, longer commutes, the decline of the high street, decrease in organised religion, people needing to ""get on their bikes"" to find work. 

Some benefit cuts actively mitigate against community. For example cuts to social care stop elderly people from living in their own homes. Cuts in housing benefit force people to move away from friends and relatives. Cuts to library services threatens the ecosystem of people who use the library. 

Having said that, I'm part of a reasonably cohesive and supportive local community, and I would welcome any ideas for improving and extending this.

He forced teams to go very far our of their way to shut him down, which made life a little easier for our other attackers. His presence was absolutely massive and no one else we have or can get (unless we go utterly ape-shit crazy and use the Suarez money to buy James Rodriguez or Falcao or something like that, which will never happen, and even then James is 2-3 seasons off from approaching Suarez level) will demand that kind of attention from the opposing team on their own. Suarez not being involved will make teams much less scared of us because they will get to pay more attention to everyone. Previously we were good enough to capitalize on what other teams did to try and stop Suarez. Him no longer being there is a big deal. Obviously you have to pay attention to everyone, but to suggest teams came out without specific attention to Suarez seems silly. You can see him being doubled up on and aggressively hacked/kicked/fouled much more than anyone else in many of our games, especially against the top 4.

Pointing out how he rarely scored until we are ahead is fine. But consider that he made the game safe, took the opposition's hearts out by scoring quite a few of the goals that killed off games and put us indomitably ahead. Those goals are really important too, not just some novelty.

Don't try to downplay how significant the loss of Suarez will be. You don't lose the third best player in the world and get better immediately. We'll get to improve a few areas of the pitch but there is no attacking player (or players) we can bring in to create a net gain in our attack right away. We will lose some individual magic and a whole lot of determination up front. We will lose goals, creativity, and consistency.  It is going to hurt a lot.

&gt;__Larne or Lairne__ (from [Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language): *Latharna*, the name of a [Gaelic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_Ireland) territory)    is a seaport and industrial market town, as well as a [civil parish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_parishes_in_Ireland), on the east coast of [County Antrim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Antrim), [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland) with a population of 18,323 people in the 2008 Estimate.  As of 2011, there are about 32,000  residents in the greater Larne area. It has been used as a [seaport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaport) for over 1,000 years, and is today a major passenger and freight [roll-on roll-off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roll-on/roll-off) port.  Larne is twinned with [Clover, South Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clover,_South_Carolina) which has named one of its schools, [Larne Elementary School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larne_Elementary_School),  after Larne. Larne is administered by [Larne Borough Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larne_Borough_Council). Together with the neighbouring district of [Carrickfergus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrickfergus) and part of [Newtownabbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtownabbey), it forms the [East Antrim constituency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Antrim_(UK_Parliament_constituency\)) for elections to the [Westminster Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Parliament) and [Northern Ireland Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Assembly).

Having said that, commanders wouldn't put them in a position where they were likely (on balance) to be lost. Clearly they would be extremely risky assets to even deploy in a major campaign against a developed power... but by the same token the world hasn't really seen a real head to head war between two developed powers for a long time. Carriers of 2014 are not used in the same ways they were in 1944...

There are lots of examples where they have proved decisively useful including in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Looking further backs carriers facilitated any form of victory in the Falklands War, and the loss of a carrier would likely have cost the war and forced the UK to sue for a less preferential diplomatic settlement likely succeeding sovereignty to Argentina. In Vietnam carriers gave the US a crucial strategic advantage, and, when they ultiamtely lost the war carriers facilitated the withdrawal of their own forces and political allies.

I do agree the Chinese are deliberately developing anti-shipping missiles as part of their own pacific strategy which can be broadly described as ""area denial""... i.e. in the future they can try to force the US Navy out of the South China Sea with the threat of saturation assaults with anti-ship missiles (where large volumes of cheap missiles are used simultaneously to overcome the ships point-defenses by brute numerical force). Having said that, if we look at the places we are likely to be involved in conflict in the next 25 years it's places like the Middleast (Syria in particular), Africa or perhaps less likely South-Eastern Europe. In addition our old colonial holdovers like the Falkland islands etc. can always end up throwing a curve ball as they have done in the past... none of those adversaries would necessarily be in a position to use anti-shipping missiles against an aircraft carrier, but they **would** be vulnerable to attack by an aircraft carrier, or carrier born forces.",0,1404329678,null,0,false,0,cimvox8,t3_29n2mk,t1_cimvox8,t1_cimsxld,null,1434520348,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

To be honest, the 'best' solution would be to eat the occasional bit of liver.  Liver is particularly rich in B12, and a large variety of other vitamins - indeed, the discovery of B12 as a fix for pernicious anaemia started with the observation that feeding anaemic dogs on calfs liver was the fastest way for them to recover.  It would also give a boost to the iron, and a large group of other micros, particularly those missing in potatoes and butter.

I'm not a dietician, so I'd be wary of suggesting that it would 'fix' the problem, however.


Engineered diets aside, your approach (plus any corrections) has a certain quantity of infrastructure - pan, fridge, hot plate and power; along with the knowledge on how to prepare the food. From my time helping out at a food bank, many people who are at risk of hunger and malnutrition _don't_ have all of the above.  Comments that the ""leccy was off till they I a new card next week"" were not uncommon.  People who ran out of food because the fridge broke, and they couldn't afford a replacement (or to replace the planned meals in it) also featured.

true,patricles43,null,null,"&gt; but to me this World Cup was about the USA finally starting to pay attention to the beautiful game. The game I've loved for over 20 years.

If it makes you feel any better, this is definitely true.  I lightly paid attention to the world cup when it would come around, but never really followed soccer at all.  Now I can't get enough.  I'm trying to pick up as much as I can as quickly as I can in the MLS and premier league, but my head is spinning.  So many names, tactics, intricacies, I'm on information overload a bit.

That being said, I'm hooked.  I can't get enough.  I'm listening to matches while I'm at work.  Reading articles when I am riding home.  Keeping up with /r/Hammers and /r/Soccer .  I've joined the NYC FC supporters forum.  I'm watching matches and replays.

The fans I've talked to have been unbelievable.  Everyone's been helpful, and happy that I'm finding teams to support and cheer on, even if it's not their team.  It blows me away.  It'd be like a Ravens fan giving me a (a Steelers Fan) a high five for showing up that the game, and saying ""tough luck, really enjoyed watching the Steelers play this year"" after they knocked us out of the playoffs.  WHO DOES THAT?!?!  These fans are simultaneously the most fanatical and most polite sports fans I've ever encountered.

I'm not a youngster.  I'm 33 years old.  I've got both feet firmly planted in adulthood.  My hair is thinning and turning gray.  The metabolism isn't what it used to.  But this World Cup has energized me.  It has me looking at a sport with the wide-eyed wonder of a baby playing peek-a-boo.

If you need some excitement for the coming year, I'd love for you to just talk with me.  My head is spinning from all these rumors flying around.  I have no idea if they are good or bad, plausible or extremely unlikely.  I am still learning the Hammers current players and all these new names are being thrown into the mix.  I have a general understanding of soccer from playing when I was young, playing FIFA on playstation (the original playstation), and watching the World Cup.

I can't wait for the Premier League to Kick off.  I've never watched a live Premier League game.

It's formed a solid backbone to the RAF and will continue to do so for at least another decade to come if not longer.

Defense projects in the UK always seem to be subject to this sort of media hysteria about capability... then when the damn thing turns up nobody gives a shit, because in the real world things like minimum turn radius and maximum angle of attack mean less, and simply having **something** rather than nothing makes all the difference. 

To a nation that has no carrier, having a carrier will mean everything - and the same applies to us.

You will end up being asked about almost all the things you are told not to talk about, and there's only so much mileage you can get out of 'I can't really talk about that'. I certainly ended up talking about alcohol consumption, clubbing, some things about admissions, all of which we were told not to.

Lots of people going round (especially parents!) will have lots of questions, and between that and 'this is the buttery, this is the library' etc., you will have more to say than you have time for: you don't need to worry about what you are talking about. A few people will have very little to say, but after doing it a few times with more engaged people, you'll find you have developed a set of patter already, and you'll be able to fill in most of the time anyway.

Basically, don't worry about not having enough to say, or not telling people what they want to hear: they'll tell you.

It's a good idea to have some interesting facts to bring up about the various places in college you'll visit, just to keep the constant stream of chatter going -- the pool in the fellows' garden at Christ's is one of only three pools in Cambridge colleges, for instance...

true,UndercoverFiretruck,1986,,"I personally think he would be the best replacement for Luiz. Why? Not a lot of people know this, but he was actually played mostly as a defensive midfielder in France (Lens was his club, I believe). So much so, that those who had followed him from his early days were surprised Madrid bought him to play center half. As we all know he turned out to be an absolute revelation in that position, or better yet Mourinho and Zidane saw the potential and were spot on with changing his position. I do think if we were to acquire him it would be primarily for depth in defense, especially since Terry's legs aren't as reliable as 5 years ago, but most importantly he would give us the versatility that Luiz brought to the table. 

If I'm being completely honest though, I don't see it happening. It would be my ideal acquisition of the summer, but I have to be realistic. Yes, Mourinho loves the guy and the rumors are that he's unhappy at Madrid, but since when are Madrid a selling club? Their president only sells when he gets bored with players or they're no longer needed, and I can't remember the last time someone forced their way out. We would have to offer a premium to even get Madrid's attention and I'd be far more comfortable investing in a backup striker should Mourinho plan on selling Lukaku or a backup full back for the sake of depth. 

Unfortunately it just seems like bad timing because he wouldn't start over Terry/Cahill or Matić, and if playing time is really his beef with Madrid, then we wouldn't be much of an upgrade. With Pepe getting older I can see him taking over a starting XI spot just around the same time we'll be needing to replace Terry and I fear by that point he will be indispensable to Madrid and the Varane ship will have sailed.

However, in the modern era, for many [0] we are living in a era of plenty, where we are, on average, going to eat too much, rather than too little.  Potatoes, where they make it easy to fill up on calories, are indicated as something that's contributing to the diseases of plenty; as the flip side of them begin a cure for many diseases of poverty.

Particularly as chips.

Still, they are one reason that scurvy is practically unknown, even in the poorest inner city areas.
