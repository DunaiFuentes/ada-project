false,HashPram,eng-yorkshire,Yaakshur,"Jesus, what an irritating article.
  
[There were 129,584 police officers in the UK as of 2013](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/police-workforce-england-and-wales-31-march-2013/police-workforce-england-and-wales-31-march-2013).  
Of these 32,000 responded to the survey (24.69% of the total).  
Of the respondents 5,000 would like to leave (or 3.86% of the total).  
  
That just sounds like natural wastage to me. Sure 'thousands of police officers' want to leave - that's going to be true at pretty much any time because they employ tens of thousands of people. This %age wastage is equivalent to 4 people wanting to leave a company of 150 people. It's hardly something to write a headline about.
  
  
&gt; The survey, which was released to BBC Radio 5 live Breakfast, found 94% of officers believe morale in the service was low, compared with 62% in the armed forces, who were asked the same question.  

This would be 62% of a survey we know nothing about, and so can't make any kind of fair comparison. How many people are in the ""armed forces"", by which I mean: Is this regular, reserves, or both? How many people were asked to participate in the survey? How many responded? We haven't been told any of this. So is it a fair comparison? Who knows? Not us, which is odd because the article's written like it's actually telling us something informative.
  
&gt; Some 59% of police officers said their own personal morale was low, compared with 28% of people in the armed forces.  

See previous paragraph. Also ""of police officers"" (59% of the total), or ""of respondents"" (14.57% of the total)? There's a bit of difference.  
  
What  the article also fails to mention is what the re-hiring rate is. If 5,000 people leave and 5,000 people are hired then the police force remains the same size and this isn't a calamity but just 'turnover'. But the article doesn't mention that. And 'being pissed off with this shit' is probably the #1 reason anyone voluntarily leaves any job.

What's also missing is follow-up. Of the 5,000 people who said they were going to leave how many actually leave? We don't know. I've had bad days at work and said I was going to leave. I'm still here. Is this 4% of the police force having a bad day, or 4% actually walking out the door?

Finally: The sort of people who volunteer responses to surveys at work - are they a happy bunch of people in general or not? I'm thinking probably not. Unless it's mandatory most people have better things to do, so the people who have a complaint end up being the ones who respond.

All in all then, not impressed with this. Purports to make a case for something: Actually gives you half the facts, adds some conjecture, a touch of ""bollocks comparison"" and slaps a fucking great headline on it. This article, I contend, is a pig in knickers.

I don't know, and although the article is clearly intimating that that's the case, it doesn't back that intimation up with anything concrete.   
      
&gt; The other important thing to note is that previously it was very rare for people to leave once in, almost everyone did their full 30 years and retired (unless they fucked up), with the changes to the pension scheme there's suddenly a lot of coppers thinking ""fuck this"".  

&gt; Whilst you might not consider this to be important, it does point towards a police service in crisis.  

The days when people did their job for 30 years and got early retirement was my dad's generation. He's 70, I'm 45. In my working life (the last 20 or so years) job turnover has been relatively high compared to my dad's generation. I'm not saying I don't think it's important, but the police aren't unique when it comes to increased turnover, and it shouldn't surprise anyone that the same staffing problems that affect employers in general also affect the police.",0,1414574540,null,0,false,0,cln1duz,t3_2knne3,t1_cln1duz,t1_cln132l,null,1426294412,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

This could be the standard leaving rate (retirement and other reasons) and is only noticable because the police haven't been recruiting the last couple of years.

Another bit of maths for you: according to google, there are 134,101 police officers in the UK. Assuming that the distribution of ages in the police force is uniform (ie. there are the same number of 50 year old police officers as 30 year old etc.), and that all police officers work from 24 to 60 (retirement age). That gives a base rate of losing 134,101/36 = 3944 officers through retirement every year, or 2.94%. This may be an underestimate, as I imagine a decent number of officers retire before 60 as it can be quite an active job.

Therefore, the actual value of interest is the 3.6-2.94 = 0.66% of police who are deciding to leave outside of retirement.

Unfortunately, from what I know of it, tax law is rather complicated. Of course, they could change the law, but it would probably have to be something along the lines of taxing companies within the UK based on *income*, not *profit*, which would probably slowly drive away any large businesses, especially considering not (m)any other countries do it, as far as I can tell, or if they do, they're likely suffering based on it. This would probably be rather bad for our economy, though whether it'd be worse than the current tax avoidance or better is something I have no clue about.

Alternatively, we could try making it illegal to withhold tax like this from the government. Problem is, we would have to lay out what ""withholding"" is, and we can't just say ""Paying another (foreign) company lots of money for a product usually not that expensive"" as it could be a novelty product, and would cause potential issues with the understanding of the law. We also couldn't just say ""if a company has the intent to reduce the lawful tax they pay to the government through malicious / back-handed means"" since... we're defining the act/crime that they're committing through what their mental state, and as far as I know for a crime to have been committed, an act has to have occurred and they must have (in the case of harm / murder, at least?) malice or intent, which is either through them actually *wanting* to cause at least grievous bodily harm, and then the person dying from a result of their attempt, or through being reckless with the consequences foreseen. [This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malice_(law) Wikipedia page may explain it better than I have.

I'm not exactly sure how ""attempted [murder/whatever]"" crimes work, since they seem to be lacking the act and only have the mindset, but perhaps that would be a route to try? Then again, might require a concrete, clearly-defined action for them to have at least *attempted* to do.

So... I'd certainly love it if we could somehow change the laws to make it so if a huge company ends up paying a ridiculously low amount of tax, then there's some way to fine them for what they ""should"" pay, but I think it's unlikely. From what I know of it, law is complicated, and tax law even further so, and there are certain requirements on something to be defined a ""crime"" so that if someone just exploits a loophole within our current laws, there's no legal recourse because they haven't technically broken the law. We can change the laws in a way which harms other businesses and drives them away from our economy, or we find a way to define a crime off the intent to deprive the government of tax (pretty sure that's impossible, but I could be wrong), but neither of those seem like they're going to be viable options.

Oh, also, this is based on Starbucks's case. I don't know what Google or Amazon did to avoid tax, though if it was similar then this might apply to them too.

**TL;DR**: They haven't broken the current laws... If we changed the current laws, we'd probably drive away businesses. It would be difficult/impossible to word a law which makes depriving ""rightful"" tax illegal since it's kinda subjective.

Over time the same thing happens. If I borrow Â£9.4bn in 1979, even adjusting for inflation doesn't mean much in todays figures, because our economy is many many times larger than it was then. Thats why this graph isn't useful.

The student age group is the most radical, in pretty much every election ever. More than anything else, that only 5% bothered to vote yes should send massive alarm bells ringing. Queens has a fairly sizeable nationalist majority; well out of proportion to NI's electorate. That only 5% of the most radical portion of the electorate actually voted in favour, when they should be both most likely to vote and most likely to vote yes should be concerning. More people in a majority nationalist institution cared to vote (overwhelmingly) on neutrality than on the constitutional question, where, even though there should have been a theoretical majority, it was defeated.

Extrapolating that up to the NI population in general is also dangerous. As we've seen, there's a fairly sizeable nationalist majority at Queens. This isn't the case with the general electorate. Even though the sectarian headcount demographics are getting closer, more catholics will vote no (by a fair margin) than protestants will vote yes. I doubt very much that the majority of more affluent catholics east of the Bann see themselves as 'under London's thumb'. My (obviously anecdotal) experience is that the majority are pretty happy with the constitutional arrangements as things are, and wish the whole thing would go away, but would vote no. Mrs ny-batteri, her extended family and all her schoolfriends are cases in point. I'm from a protestant background, but she's much more British than I am.

Similarly I went to a mixed school where the catholic population was representative of its proportion in the community (about a third) and I doubt any of them would vote yes. I'm not making a value judgement on whether they have good arguments or not; but those are the type of people any yes campaign is going to have to win over, and it'll be a lot more difficult than somewhere that has an inbuilt nationalist majority.

If you actually mean why, it's because it suits some of us. From this point on it gets a bit ranty. I apologise for that, but I am cross so I'm not sorry.

I get WTD pay in lieu of annual leave (other zero hour workers, under relatively new rules, this must be a *seperate line* on your payslip and *not* part of your basic hourly rate) and can take time off whenever I want at short notice. I get the same training, working conditions, and vaccinations (I work in a hospital) as full time staff. I'm taxed PAYE and am part of the company pension scheme.

I'm a part time student in a long distance relationship who has a long-term sick parent, I need that flexibility to make my life practical and keep me sane. Colleagues on zero hour contracts are single parents, semi-retired, have chronic illnesses, or need the extra cash for their own reasons. Most of us chose this.

From the government's point of view, a lot of the people I work with on zero hour contracts would otherwise be claiming some sort of financial assistance, and/or using state funded services to plug the gaps. Instead, we're paying taxes.

There seems to be this idea that the alternative to zero hour contracts is a fixed hour contract, and it isn't. Few employers are willing to offer that kind of flexibility to a fixed hour employee, and frankly, I don't expect them to keep making allowances for my decision to go back to education, especially considering I'm pretty much planning to abandon their entire industry afterwards. No, the alternative for me is some bullshit ""self employed vacancy"".

I'm not denying that some employers take advantage of zero hour contracts, and to some extent I've got lucky, but I'm very happy with my situation and in no hurry to change it. Banning them outright would make my life unnecessarily difficult.",0,1414578534,null,0,false,0,cln234k,t3_2knok8,t1_cln234k,t3_2knok8,null,1426294084,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3

They believe the Scots should get a say on independence and the British should get a say on electoral reform, but the far bigger political issue of the EU should be decided by politicians.

I don't disagree that you could support the EU and still support a referendum. That said the Liberal Democrats are the most pro-EU of the three (or indeed four) main parties.

Unfortunately they've done a miserably poor job of articulating why the EU is a good thing. Take as an example Clegg claiming (at one of the (humiliating) Clegg Farage debates) that leaving the EU would lose the recovery achieved by the Coalition government. That's not credible when you're talking to a room full of people who all feel considerably poorer than before. ""Recovery, you say? Who benefited from that, Mr. Clegg?""

The problem seems to me to be that the Liberal Democrats are over willing to make promises they would drop in a heartbeat. They won't support an EU referendum, because it's not a sure win right now.

Something like [this,](http://youtu.be/lKS8wl4S_Gs?t=2m40s) for example.

When Lukaku gets passed the ball, sometimes it's a 50/50 whether he'll be able to control it or not. I think it's improving though, I remember [this goal](https://mediacru.sh/VUlV9zN5URst) from last season which showed a bit of promise in that regard, and if he can get on top of that he'll be able to become one of the best strikers in the league.

Apparently Zamora and John Terry are fishing buddies. Being mates, that might give Bobby the nonchalance to really get stuck into physical battles, leaving the noble Englishmen Austin and Cahill to duel it out themselves.

The midfield worries me a little bit here. They can throw so much at us, and we will need absolutely robotic performances from whoever starts from Henry, Barton and Sandro to neutralise them. Not sure where this leaves our distribution to be honest, other than Barton's long balls.

I wouldn't mind seeing a solid bus parking strategy here. A 5 man back line? Variation of the 3-5-2, with the wingbacks playing very conservatively?

Harry must have a proper selection headache on this one. Some of our best performers from the last two games are going to have to settle for bench roles. Maybe play it defensively for the first 70, and if we're hanging on, play a wildcard pace player who might nick something?

Vargas, Hoilett and Yun being on the pitch might draw them into fouls. Those dead ball situations might bag us a sneaky goal.

So if I was dicking around on Football Manager, I'd go with a backline of Dunne in between Caulker and Onuoha, with Yun and Isla as fullbacks. A four man midfield, Sandro and Barton in the middle with Vargas and Hoilett on the wings. Austin as the lone striker - with instructions to not drop too deep and wait on breaks from the wings. I love that he is willing to drop back to put in a defensive shift, but maybe for this one he should gamble with focusing on trying to nick a goal.

We've sold out the away section, and it will probably be more useful if the energy is directed towards positive feedback for the players rather than bollocks at the Chelsea crowd, Terry and Remy. Unless it all goes 4-0 again. In which case you make your own entertainment, eh?

As a football fan I think the FA Cup is a bit special because of how far reaching it is, how far down teams can be and still play a part in it, and so it is a bit more of a romanticised trophy, and still also holds a bit of weight from when it was actually worth playing for.  

I'd change the money rewarded so that there was a slight bit more incentive to go for it, but also so that there'd be more reward for teams from lower league that manage to progress. Bradford getting to the League Cup final a couple of years ago probably barely saw a reward for it, and teams at that level definitely don't have the squad depth to play a full cup run plus their league matches (of which there are more than PL) plus possibly another cup game or two in the other cup.  

I'd like to test our squad depth a little bit, blood a few more youngsters like previous years, and so I wouldn't mind the fixtures, though after November we may be too busy crying and remembering being 2nd to want more cup matches that can sap our team. Everyone seems to think we have more strength in depth this year, and I'd like to see it tested properly because if we can't handle a single cup run (baring in mind this is before the FA Cup starts) we'd never, ever, survive Europe.

I mean, if you were watching a game of football, and decided to swap out Barcelona for Chelsea halfway through only very superficial things would change.  While both teams go about their game a bit differently, their ultimate aims are still the same, the pitch is still the same and the rules of the game remain unchanged and ultimately the system continues on in it's merry way.  I don't even think we'd get massive change if UKIP were voted in, to be honest, only in that case you'd basically be replacing Chelsea with a Sunday pub league team.

This is why I'm frustrated that so much discussion today is about the importance of voting above all else when it comes to political engagement, when really it's just one step in a process.  If you don't have a populace who are actively engaged in politics from the bottom up then voting frankly becomes of less and less worth, and you end up with a highly centralised and distant political body, as we have today.  There are many things that voting alone cannot change, which require bottom-up political action.  The changes brought about by the civil rights movement, for example, weren't achieved by voting.

You are, but you're also making an important point. Some people are going to feel uncomfortable living in a community that differs from the one in which they grew up in. And that does include smells, sounds, sights and more - our whole sensory perspective on the world around us.

And by uncomfortable I don't mean that they're agitated and keeping their hand on their wallet-pocket; just that they're living in a world they're not used to, and that is sufficient, for many, to feel dissociated from their community.

Unfortunately this is often equated with racism when it really isn't. People like what they know, and if they end up living a life that differs from the norm they may not enjoy it so much. And if they don't, then they should feel free to move to somewhere they do feel comfortable, not be pointed at, accused of being a bigot, and feel morally obliged to stay put.

I've never owned a modular helmet, but I have had a few accidents- now my first ever accident was a 60mph lowside. I rubbed the chin guard of my AGV helmet along the ground pretty good, and then gave it a jaw full of crash barrier for good measure. That protected me well; no injury above the shoulders at all.

Now I look at the statistics on the Sharp website (mind you, I am sceptical of their methods of testing) Now, looking at the shoei neotec, probably one of the best modular helmets on the market- in 93% of impacts, the faceguard stayed fully locked. do I want to chance that I'm not in the 7% when I crash? No. Look to other helmets, and just for example, the Viper RS101. 40% of impacts, the faceguard stayed locked. that's a big NO THANK YOU from me. Added to the fact that modular helmets almost always weigh more, are noisier, I have little justification for one. Plus, back on the safety point, there's always the chance that the face guard comes unlocked, snags on something, and it's pivoted you round on your neck, snapping your neck in the process. 

My summary: I wear my helmet to protect me if I crash. Why would I compromise that factor for some added convenience?

Then series 7 being split in two parts was horrible and the fact they were all single episodes made it feel really rushed, then there was also the fact that for no reason whatsoever they teased and teased Clara/11 (I have no idea why. It literally made no sense since there was no pay off or build up considering they killed what should have been the only Clara, the real Clara, the Victorian one). 

Sometimes the show needs to pull itself back. A 13 episode season with 2 or 3 two parters and an overall season arc is fine. That's how it should be. No split in the season, and no overwhelming mess. Have things cross over into new seasons eg the woman in the shop, how did the TARDIS explode, but overall keep it tight and simple.

I pay great attention to the show and have watched it since it came back in 2005 but honestly I've completely forgotten key points between series 5 and 7 because stuff got way too cluttered. Too much to remember, with information being stored in throw off lines.

They're even doing it now. The only indication we had that Danny and Clara have been together for over a year is because of a line of dialogue said by a parent at parents evening.

When we win it back, straight to Bobby, to Charlie, to goal. Then, when we're defending a 1-0 lead and they throw on Costa, we remove Bobby/Charlie and put hoilett on, then drop deeper.

There is no chicken vs egg logic at all, you're just struggling to understand something so simple. If they don't pick names out of a hat how do they go about it? By figuring out who's has the most versatile attributes. The fact that I keep bringing it up is because I'm wondering how exactly you think they choose players to play out of position if it's not for their versatility? Why Did Azpi play games at LB with Marsielle instead of Rod Fanny? Why did Ivanovic get shifted to RB and not Terry? Why did Ramires get played on the wing and not Lampard? Please try and explain to me how these decisions were made if these players weren't versatile until after the changes were made because going by what you've said the only explanation that could possibly make any sense would be for their names to be taken from a hat.

I genuinely can't tell if you're being serious. The whole discussion was about Izzy Brown playing out of position for his debut, so Ake playing out of position on his debut is COMPLETELY RELEVANT AND PROVES MY POINT THAT IT HAPPENS. Also, yes he does play CDM/CM when he plays for the first team but I think that's more to do with his size now, at u21 level he plays at CB and the difference is he plays week in week out for the u21's compared to the 10 times he's played in 3 years for the first team and those 10 apps are spread across 3 positions. Again though, I ask you how Ake playing out of position on his debut is any different to the point at hand that Brown played out of position on his debut.

Did you even pay attention to your own original comment when you wrote it? You never said he played more CM at WBA than he has at Chelsea because that's a given considering he hasn't played there once for us but what you said was;

&gt; More CM at West Brom but now with Chelsea either up top or on the wings

Again, you never said he was more CM at West Brom than Chelsea, just he was more CM at West Brom which he wasn't. Yes he did play there, but he still played up top more.

Historic peak"". Historic since what date? Was there a general upward trend to 2009, or do the numbers bounce around a lot? The peak alone might not tell you much;  

144353 (peak numbers) - 128351 (the headline number) - both reported as 'officer numbers' in the Guardian article - is 16002, not 15995.

Younger officers and staff are therefore less likely to get promotion, as well as not qualifying for the same pension packages etc. The result of this is that if you're young, intelligent and skilled, you will look for another career, leaving mostly the people that are in the job for the wrong reasons (attracted to authority, enjoy a scrap etc).

false,stufstuf,null,null,"Hallo there! Could you let us know what your skin type is and what products you used to use?

There are a few of us (like me!) who import skincare products from Korea, so we might be able to let you know of possible dupes, or comparable products! I'll just give you some general idea.

####Makeup Removal 

- *Micellar water* was the hot new makeup remover item this year. Pretty much every brand in Boots or Superdrug has a version, most are pretty similar. I've only tried the L'Oreal version and it's okay. 

- *Oil Cleansing* has now become the newer trend. Again, I've only tried [L'oreal](http://adoredee.com/2014/10/20/review-loreal-skin-perfection-miracle-cleansing-oil/), but Boots have an own brand and other brands like Sanctuary have their own formulation.

I've found that these are the more gentle way of removing makeup compared to wipes and other liquids.

######Milk Cleansers

I don't know much about milk cleansers. 

*L'Occitane* have the only brand of milk cleanser that I've used and not had any irritation. I bought their [shea butter starter kit](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-twPb14oTSN8/UVifgVKA3sI/AAAAAAAAEa8/L256WRrgIG0/s640/L'Occitane+Shea+Butter+Skin+Care+Starter+Kit.JPG) to try products out which was Â£15. They have taken it down from their website, but I know they still sell it. They always hide it during Christmas (for whatever reason). It came with everything but the serum, and I really enjoy the toner as a plain and simple hydrating and cleansing toner. It isn't special but not irritating.

I wouldn't get sucked into that brand though. They are expensive, but have no active ingredients in their products and are very overpriced for what they do. The only good thing is that they are usually pretty generous with their samples!

######Moisturisers

- *Eucerin* are my go to recommendation brand. I've been using their DermoPurifyer range this year and everything I've used I've loved. They are a brand that's committed to science based skincare and have excellent customer service. They have great cleansers, toners, moisturisers, everything. If you want to start with a brand, I'd start with Eucerin. 

* *Vichy* also have great moisturisers. I've used their [Night Detox moisturiser](http://adoredee.com/2014/10/21/review-vichy-normaderm-night-detox/) and I really like it. They also do okay-ish serums, but I find them a little too fragranced for me.

**Toners**

It really depends what you want the toner to do, refresh, hydrate, exfoliate?

**Sheet Masks**

I would recommend that you buy them from Korea as sheet masks aren't that big here and so are exceptionally expensive. [Muji sell plain sheet masks](http://www.muji.eu/pages/online.asp?Sec=17&amp;Sub=70&amp;PID=1523) that you can then rehydrate.  They also have [under eye patches](http://www.muji.eu/pages/online.asp?Sec=17&amp;Sub=70&amp;PID=1524).

Muji also sells [cotton pads](http://www.muji.eu/pages/online.asp?Sec=17&amp;Sub=70) that are similar to the ones in Asia.

Tips for shopping in the UK! If you haven't already, sign up for a Boots card! The points add up quickly and they are always sending useful coupons and vouchers. 

If they don't have a product you want in store, use their click and collect service online. They do free next day delivery to the store and you still get to collect your points.

Check your supermarkets! They sell skincare too, and often do big discounts. Get a Sainsbury's Nectar card, you can spend the points you accumulate on food and drink on skincare (:",0,1414583825,null,0,false,0,cln376m,t3_2knvbu,t1_cln376m,t3_2knvbu,null,1426293565,1,false,SkincareAddictionUK,t5_32evd,1

Cops don't make the LAW, they are called upon to enforce it.

'Discretion' and 'common sense' with regards to petty offences including basic possess'n of cannabis is a thing of the past and actively discouraged by senior leadership/Gov't who want drones and automatons NOT people willing/able to make decisions.

Cops are part of society , not removed from it- so shit service, shit protection, piss poor numbers and morale affect them and their families.

Whilst there are repeated examples of police incompetence/abuse of power/blah blah blah, given the number of interactions/incidents - it is a drop in the ocean- That does not mean there isn't room for improvement but it equally doesn't mean the sky is falling down.

 Regardless of what Gov't/senior leadership of police/acpo/hmic/ipcc/ Pcc's/ Press and Tv will tell you - most cops weren't around at Hillsborough/miners strike/Brixton/toxteth/ etc  etc... in fact most weren't even born.

 It should also be noted that regardless of what you're told, the cops are forced to chase figures, hence why you end up with thefts from cars getting more resources than sexual exploitation of kids/rape/ etc etc, but no Chief Constable is going to go on TV and risk their knighthood telling you that their force deprioritised such matters- as all too difficult/low reward, might cost them their bonus  etc etc. and thus you have resulting knee jerk reactions by gov't and cops to ever increasing crisis's and loss of support/confidence.


 
If you breathe heavily on your partner- the chances are you will be arrested for domestic violence.
(for reason see previous point)

Putting a trainspotter in charge of police reform , then making him effectively head fubar was the act of a Gov't who for whatever reason don't want an 'effective'/independent (of gov't) police service.

and yes cops are leaving, being replaced by inexperienced and gobby teens who will take years to learn that with power does come responsibility and that yes you can arrest/hit people but there is more than one way to skin a cat.

Increasingly  I am a Mental health nurse/social worker/teacher/relationship guru/streetcleaner/punchbag/ paramedic as every other service gets to walk away/wash their hands until the wheel comes off.

The long-term trend is ""the lowest level since March 2002"" (page 6), and this (page 6, chart) is just above mid-1990s levels of full-time police staff.  
  
So the Guardian is correct that historic peak occurred in 2009 (September, to be precise - the figures are published bi-annually), but the number isn't the one reported in the Guardian, and it's not clear that the number they have reported relates to full-time officers.  
  
Looking at that chart again, the trend since 1979 is upwards, the trend since 2005 is downwards. Take your pick.  ",0,1414585804,null,0,false,0,cln3qeh,t3_2knne3,t1_cln3qeh,t1_cln3euc,null,1426293316,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Westminster covers a large area, some of it nice, some of it not so nice. It's not like we're all living in streets paved with gold in the shadow of the Houses of Parliament here.  Half of the street I live in is made up of social housing and it's been this way for decades. Most of it is being gentrified so private landlords can make absolute fortunes and yeah, social cleansing is happening here whether people ( from an outside perspective ) choose to believe it or not. People are being forced out of their homes so the select few can profit, and they are profiting handsomely from this. No doubt. 

However most of these people have been living here for generations, they're surrounded by their friends and family.  Just because money is moving in and a select few are profiteering though doesn't mean that they don't have a right to live in their homes any more.  

Or maybe it does? 

If you're lucky your place is with a housing association ( for now your safe although they're slowly finding ways around that )  if your not then you're out.  Same is happening with Camden, same with Brent, same with Hackney, same with Tower Hamlets etc. etc. Westminster is just another London borough in the middle of it. 

I'm personally sitting in the middle of this watching it all happen, but there again I've attended the meetings, I've heard the arguments, all I'm seeing is profiteering at the expense of others and it's all being backed and supported by our government mainly because a lot of them are either landlords themselves or involved in some alternative self serving capacity. Some would say it's corruption ( whether legal or not ) and an abuse of power. I would tend to agree. 


People like playing devils advocate through, mainly because it's not happening to them and if ""I can't live there then why should they"" seems to be the rhetoric ( and we're falling for it )  but people's lives are being fucked with here. People who don't deserve it. People who are already down on their luck. That's a fact.

I'm loving NSPA which is exclusive to Asda supermarkets; Superdrug vitamin E, Simple, Eucerin and Olay from Boots or Superdrug all have some decent products. other places to shop around for the common brands at cheaper prices include the discounters Bodycare and Wilko.

Some brands like Olay are almost always on a half price or two for one offer at one of the supermarkets, pharmacies or discounters. Boots pharmacy tends to be more expensive than Superdrug, Tesco supermarket tends to be more expensive than Asda.

For the quality of the ingredients The Body Shop can be pricey but there are a few gems. They also decant free samples of anything into little pots if you ask, and sometimes offer extra discounts at the till. They tries to upsell me three for two yesterday, when I declined I got a second product half price. I got another voucher on my till receipt: they also have a student discount scheme.

You might be able to speculate based on certain aspects of their game, but you wouldn't know that they could do it until they did and performed adequately.

They all have the work rate and dedication to get back and defend, but they also all lack some of the natural ability and comfort in defense that you need.  While it would be really fun to watch the attacks if we can play with a high tempo in possession, we'd be gutted on the counter and on long periods without possession.  While Pardew is a moron, he does have some good players in his side, they're not a pushover.

The second one is interesting, I've wondered about a 4-2-2-2 similar to what City plays at times with our players.  I don't think you can play Gerrard in that formation though, he isn't defensive enough to cover in a 2 man midfield.  You could do it with Henderson/Can sitting deep though, or maybe Henderson/Lucas (but I would worry for Lucas's ability to cover ground there).  I don't think Henderson/Allen would work because there isn't enough physical presence.  It works for teams like City because their deep sitting 2 midfielders are beasts... Yaya, Fernando, and Fernandinho are all big, strong players in addition to their wonderful technique.  They are very imposing, something most of our midfielders are not.  

I'd prefer to see the diamond though, I think if we can stick into something we're somewhat familiar with already it'll help us get going and working better as a team quicker.  Making little tactical shifts and tweaks as BR likes to do is fine to suit the opposition, but it'll be really helpful if we keep things similar until the players know each other better.  Based on last night's performances [this is how I'd line it up](http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=558v).  Or if it's the 4-3-3 again then Sterling and Borini to either side of Balotelli.

Borini over Lallana because he was very good yesterday.  Very bright and full of energy, looked dangerous and came close quite a few times too.  I think there's enough creativity between Sterling and Coutinho that a more direct player like Borini is good to have in there with Balotelli.

Ah, the old 4chan righteous indignation switcheroo.

&gt; He's commenting on this particular story

Yes, he is. Folks like him comment on it a lot. Then they make new accounts and comment a bit more. Then they tell their friends to promote their comments. 

&gt; What's wrong with focusing solely on the exploitation of 1400 young girls in Rotherham in the comments section of an article about Rotherham? 

Because the mere endless posting of these articles is political. It would be no different from a newspaper only choosing to cover e.g. corruption of one political party while ignoring their own favoured groups. It's dishonest, wrong and worthy of criticism. 

&gt; You're not actually responding to the statistics posted 

They aren't ""statistics"", at least not in any meaningful sense. It would be like concluding that 100% of all robberies occur on trains by looking at Ronnie Biggs &amp; Buster Edward's gang. What purpose does it achieve?

&gt; How do these stories of yours make Rotherham any less important? 

There are far far far more of them. All of these cases combined are evidence of a much wider problem of police inaction. When someone implies this is a result of immigration or ""multi-culturalism"" I'll call them out on it. 

A sister of a friend of mine is a victim of child abuse from when she was in a state home and later in foster care. I had little respect for the police in this matter to begin with because I know through personal experience that formal complaints to them during the 80s and 90s were ignored. My friend had to take matters into her own hands, as soon as she turned 18 (iirc) she became the legal guardian for the much younger sister so that she should be taken out of the system &amp; moved to another part of the UK, that was the only way to end the abuse. 

The police simply did not give a fuck. There have been recent stories on this very topic, where the police had clearly stated that they prioritised things like burglaries over child abuse. They claimed it was due to a lack of resources.

&gt; The police and local government didn't care about the Rotherham victims because of the race of the perpetrators.

That is a bald faced lie. The only ""evidence"" of that are the statements from *those who did not care*. They are seeking to blame others for their own inaction. People like that should not be taken at their word, they have an inherent bias in wanting to avoid sacking or even jail time. Would you want this mess on your CV? Easier for them to blame others. 

It's a nonsensical proposal. Pretty much child abuse was ignored in the UK when not promoted by a media scandal. So to argue that this one kind of abuse was ignored for entirely different reasons is either dishonest or stupid. 

&gt; Do you deny that a disproportionate amount of asian men were involved in sexual abuse 

In these specific ""grooming"" cases that seems to be the case. But most child abuse comes from family members &amp; those in positions of authority. Focusing on one specific type is dishonest. Plus it's easy to see why it's the case, ""native"" abusers have opportunities available to them that asian men don't. How many care homes and children's hospitals are ran by asian men? How many children's clubs and media outlets like the BBC? Criminals are opportunistic, they operate on what is available to them. For a taxi driver or kebab shop child abuser that means local troubled kids. They don't have keys to a private ""rape room"" in Stoke Hospital like the likes of Savile had. 

&gt; against almost entirely white girls?

Seems to me that their victim count are rather close to the actual population stats of the regions.

This was your sentence which suggests he played at CM more than any other position at West Brom whereas he plays more up top or on the wings at Chelsea.

Again, the wingers/#10 is a huge difference in United's setup because they play with traditional wingers(Beckham, Giggs, Valencia, Young, Park Ji-Sung) Which is probably why the likes Nani didn't come good for United and why Kagawa couldn't adapt, the only modern Winger who did work really well for United was Ronaldo and well, he's Ronaldo.

&gt; The big thing you're missing is I'm talking about you watching the games. Not how the manager picks the team. 

I'm not missing anything, you may have tried to divert it to that but that wasn't what was originally said. You asked me why Steve Clarke would start Brown in midfield, so why would we be looking at it from a spectators point of view? Surely to answer the question we would need to look at it from a managers/coaches pov, no?

I also remember him putting on Morison on several occasions when we were chasing the game... when we had Sharp and BLOODY ADRYAN on the bench. 

Which brings me to my next point... How can a manager not think Adyran is ready for the championship? I've not seen someone that can control the ball that well for ages. He's passionate, determined and likes going past people. We've been crying out for someone like that for ages. And Darko -- who seemed suspicious of youth -- should have trusted Cook and Mowatt to be able to play with him much earlier than the wolves game.

So when we want to know how much the government is borrowing in comparison to the size of state for which it borrows, removing as much volatility as possible is essential if we are to draw any conclusions.
Put simply, to see how the governments spending has changed, it is essential that I am clearly able to compare this years number to last years number. Using income makes that more difficult.

&gt;How? 

Government income is far more easily controlled by the government than GDP.  Politicians can do things to boost government income on strategically important years, doing this with GDP is far more difficult.

&gt; It's easier. And it would be a more useful comparison in my eyes.

No, its not easier, because numbers would jump around massively from year to year (rendering the metric useless). And again gov debt to income would be more easily manipulated by politicians.

- Trying to contain and seal off riots is the only really viable option. Chasing after rioters for a whole night while wearing riot gear and carrying a riot shield just isn't happening. It would also be downright dangerous too. Following rioters would just create ambush opportunities.

- Tougher riot control wouldn't deter people. With things like plastic bullets and water cannons the riot control here is already considered tough. If we look back to the Troubles were the riot control was arguably more aggressive riots still happened frequently. Tougher riot control would only incense people and lead to more rioting. I mean, in Bloody Sunday 14 people were shot dead during a relatively small riot. What did nationalists do the very next day? Riot en masse.   

- By being more aggressive we would give these people more propaganda. Every little transgression is exploited and held up as examples of police brutality by the fleggers. We don't want to give them more shit for them to spew.

- Where do we draw the line if you don't see police brutality towards violent individuals? If petrol bombs are deadly weapons then why don't we just shoot them with live ammo? Stones and bricks can kill people too, do we want to end up like the Israelis in Palestine shooting hundreds of stone-throwers? The police response has to be proportional.

Drogba has a terrific professional attitude, really sets an example for all the younger players whether its Shrewsbury away, or United at Old Trafford.

Ake is actually really good, like not even rotation good, like any premier league club outside Chelsea, City, Arsenal, United, Liverpool, Everton, Southampton, he is a starting DM. Phenomenal tackler too, not afraid to set the tone.

Salah is fast. That is it. He is an Egyptian Aaron Lennon. (If Salah isn't on loan/sold for Piazon/Thorgan I may cry next year.)

Zouma shuts off now and again, but he's young.

Mikel was abhorrent. When there are 2 central midfielders, and one is 19, and the other has made ~250 appearances, it's both an indicator of how good the 19 year old is and how poor the veteran is, when the veteran is routinely outperformed. He keeps the ball, fantastic, but he doesn't really do anything with it, just kind of keeps things cycling forward, but he's not so efficient at it that it's ultimately that beneficial? He just kinda trots around, fouls people, then fucks up clearances for the other team to score. The human fulltime whistle has been poor of late. 

Luis is a beautiful player to watch. So good going forward, great tackler, always dynamic and looking for it going forward. Maybe too eager to put the ball in the box right away (fantastic crosser too), but lovely signing.

Christensen was really solid. Playing out of position he did a job, even got forward some. He sort of reminds me of Cahill, idk, but he's very solid. 

Schurrle has bundles of quality but dead poor decision making. He's obviously trying to play his way back into the squad after an injury, but he looked really selfish yesterday. Disappointing.

Firstly, I assume you're not talking about the article any more, because 15 years is not a generation. It's nothing. And the kids have only been in school for 5 years which is even less than nothing.

What we are talking about here is someone who owns no property and has very little historical connection to the place. They are only living in London because they were being given enough money to pay for the rent. Rent goes up, the council no longer wants to pay such high rent, so they are told to move somewhere with lower rent. By keeping them there and paying them more government money to cover the rent, all you'd be doing is funnelling *more* government money into the pockets of the landlords.

Chances are even if the Time Lords tried something similar, it would have destroyed them before they could do anything effective, if they could control it enough to do anything.

With Listen, the Doctor said when he first hooked up the TARDIS to Clara, he turned the safeties off and slaved the TARDIS to her. Because she was thinking about Danny when in flight, they ended up in his childhood. When she flew it a second time telepathically, she was thinking of the Doctor and ended up on Gallifrey. As for how they got through, the Time Lock is not absolute. Dalek Caan ended up back in the Time War. And I'd argue that since the TARDIS safeties were off, that's how they ended up there this time. Plus the Doctor did save Gallifrey, it's just trapped in a parallel universe. The TARDIS could have arrived on Gallirey that way. And honestly, there isn't much practical advice Clara could have given the Time Lords, even if she had the chance. 

And for the Daleks, they lured the Doctor in using a mysterious woman who could somehow contact him. The Doctor can't say no to a mystery, and the Daleks would know that.

They all live together and therefore don't integrate properly.

If they refuse to look into it further or insist that there's nothing they can do about it (without offering to look into it, cos some people do that) ask that they record it as an official complaint and that they issue something in writing confirming this as their final decision so that you can take it to the ombudsman.

I don't see how it's more difficult to do than total debt to GDP. Is income harder to arrive at accurately than GDP?

&gt;removing as much volatility as possible is essential if we are to draw any conclusions

How much does income vary? I don't see how drawing conclusions from that comparison would be difficult unless you were looking at a year in isolation. Besides, it's income that matters, not GDP. To use my analogy again, who cares if the company I do commission-based work for is doing better when I'm not making enough myself?

&gt;it is essential that I am clearly able to compare this years number 

The number is the proportion of borrowing compared to income for the previous year. If it went from 10% one year to 50% the next, it doesn't matter how it came about, that's significant.

&gt;Politicians can do things to boost government income on strategically important years

Again, so what? We're supposed to be looking at whether the goverment can afford to borrow. If they boost their income and maintain borrowing amount isn't that a good thing? We can look at the effect on GDP as a separate issue.

The thing is.. if you send a SEPA to their GBP account you will still pay the Â£10 + 2.5% (or whatever it is) to your bank as SEPA transfers always have to be converted to EUR by your bank even if the other end is going to convert them back to GBP. By sending to their GBP account instead of their EUR account you pay an extra 0.19% deposit fee on their end instead of free by using their EUR account.

If you send a SWIFT transfer it can work out better (you avoid your bank's fx fees).. you just pay your bank's SWIFT fee (usually a fixed price like Â£10 per transfer) plus kraken's 0.19% deposit fee on the other end.

kraken has different orderbooks and currently there are no orders on the GBP book so it's kindof useless until people start selling there. btc-e.com and coinfloor.co.uk also have GBP markets that can be accessed by SWIFT but there is no volume there either so somewhat useless.

The best market to access in GBP is anxbtc.com's combined orderbook.. you can send GBP SWIFT transfers to them in hong kong, and they have a merged orderbook for all currencies so there are actually coins to buy there in GBP at a good price.

Eleven spent his time running from his past, and he concealed himself in the guise of a carefree adolescent. He did all he could to hide from the serious adult within. After the resolution of the Time War in the 50th, he was allowed to refocus and stop running from himself. With his regeneration to Twelve, The Doctor dispensed with the guise of the fool, and finds himself in a new phase of his life. In the back of his mind, I believe the Doctor always found solace in that his death was near -- that despite the appearances of immortality -- he would finally have his rest. Now, he must cope with a life so long he can hardly conceive of it's end. The older he gets, the more friends and family he loses, the more alone and less connected to others he feels. That's his greatest challenge now, finding a way to care again. Care, not in the greatest utilitarian sense, but in the smallest, individual life sense.

&gt;__Jonathan Adair__, better known as __Johnny ""Mad Dog"" Adair__ (born 27 October 1963) is an [Ulster loyalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_loyalism) and the former leader of the ""C Company"", 2nd Battalion Shankill Road, [West Belfast Brigade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDA_West_Belfast_Brigade) of the ""Ulster Freedom Fighters"" (UFF). This was a cover name used by the [Ulster Defence Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Defence_Association) (UDA), a loyalist paramilitary organisation. In 2002 Adair was expelled from the organisation following a violent internal power struggle. Since 2003, he, his family and a number of supporters have been forced to leave Northern Ireland by the mainstream UDA.

The continuing sell-off of public-owned assets (although there are precious few of those) also seem very short-termist and while will give brief spikes to the bank account are still but a drop in the ocean. It doesn't help that these assets are probably undervalued as well (e.g. Royal Mail is the best example, the Channel Tunnel potentially so).

Today's story about the Police force is a fantastic example of the failure of the Tory economic policy. By cutting starting wages coppers generally are hacked off, many are threatening to quit. How do you attract new policemen? Well, higher wages might help. But in the interim you will have an overstretched force with low morale and poor resources, which can only get worse. Therefore the government will have to spend even more to get things right again.

This example is just a tiny part of the problem. Without that growth successive chancellors are likely to be fighting a losing battle against a rising debt. Without that growth there can only be more cuts, more austerity. And when we finally balance the books and take a look around we will see that we have no roads, no houses, no teachers, no nurses, etc. Instead we will have an army of security guards and cleaners, all in Serco or Sodexo uniforms.

I think that's how Tory policy will end up, and it will suit them just fine as many of their MPs have a vested interest in these contract firms anyway.

Whether or not the alternatives are any better, I dunno. Maybe, maybe not. I strongly doubt that the Tory long term plan is what's best for thee and me (thee especially: I'm over 40 and currently living and working in Sweden, so it could be argued that I have less to lose) but I've been wrong many times before.

I'd say integration is largely down to us, not Government. To welcome them and not make them feel like outsiders. It's those sorts of attitudes that will largely force any demographic to group together.  When anyone first moves here, it makes sense to move to a community that they identify with, after that, unless they feel as though they are to be welcomed into our community, they are going to stick together and not risk the racism, abuse etc they'd get for moving into a large white British community, who are often the areas most worried about immigration, despite having never really experienced it.

What could the Government do anyway? Other than force them to spread around the country, and that's just going to cause resentment.

I'd also argue that it usually takes 2 or 3 generations for integration and dispersement to happen naturally.  Look at all past large immigrant groups, Irish, Caribbean etc ... now no-one bats and eye lid about them, they are a fully integrated part of society and spread far and wide, yet when they first came over, they were ostracised, they would have been in the same position, poor, grouped together where ever the cheapest working class accommodation is (usually left behind by the native population who have moved on*), and where the work is etc  But after 2 or 3 generations, once they have had kids who go through state schooling, make friends and move away to uni etc etc then they have kids and the cycle continues and the communities spread out and the individuals , especially 3 generations in, identify more closely with British culture than that of their grandparents.

That was a gratuitous insult to the nation, which had its own national and democratic system of education before England ever dreamt of educating her people at all, and if Scotland has not fully maintained her lead during the forty years since that transfer we must attribute it to this attempt to Anglicise Scotland, and that that attempt has largely failed, as it has, is one of the strongest evidences of the vitality of Scottish nationality.""

I suspect that a part of the problem here is that you are attempting to use 'liberal' pejoratively when what you are referring to is people having the intelligence to denounce aspects of British society which are actually ridiculous, unsatisfactory, or unreliable. Has it occurred to you that what you call liberal bias is a reflection of the inadequacies of the establishment?

A real issue with the debt is that there must be a cut off point before you start clawing it back in. The prospect of spending to boost growth is based on the gamble of higher growth being maintained instead of the certainty of cutting the costs of debt. The effects of the economic crisis in 2008 have proved to be extremely costly in the long term and so we need to act now and prevent a more costly future. 

If the books are balanced, we will have less roads, houses, teachers and such, it is inevitable. However the debt interest will decrease over time giving our country more of its own money to spend. It's very much a grey area of not knowing which outcome could come out worse. However, Â£43 billion a year is nothing to sniff at given the shockingly low budgets for other departments. Â£43 into the NHS could do a great deal of good. In the last budget our debt interest was 6% of the total spending on a budget deficit of more than 14% of spending. It's also forecast to rise to almost Â£60 billion in 2016. My point is more than anything, that it is going to get worse even with the Conservatives policies now. Oh deary me.

If the cleaners are being paid minimum wage then they are likely already being paid artificially 'above market'.

I wonder what the effect on the economy would be if we scrapped minimum wage? Would employers continue to pay the amount they do now because of the competition for finding skilled cleaners?

How about we remove equal pay for women? Obviously that skewers the market in terms of competition. Whilst we're at it, let's remove discrimination law for disabilities and race - after all employers should be able to hire who they want for the amount of pay they decide!

If they deem a hard working white man is better than a black person, a woman or a disabled person, then why shouldn't they pay less than the white man gets?

&gt; How can you say that market forces will prevent abuse of wage regulation

I haven't said that, but I consider myself skilled somewhat in the industry I'm in and I'm paid far above minimum wage. I dare say if 1/65th law was introduced it wouldn't affect my pay positive or negative.

&gt; and then say that market forces should be altered out of kindness?

I haven't said that either.

&gt;Firstly, here is what I intended by the term 'ethnic comedian':

&gt;A comedian from a minority background who uses their own ethnicity as a foundation for the whole of their act, rather than looking at wider aspects of society and exploring outside of their own personal experience.

&gt;Now, here is what I intended by the term
'Women-posing-as-comics':

&gt;Director of BBC television Danny Cohen's aggressive diversity politics are well documented.

&gt;Quotas have been introduced, whereby every panel show must book a certain number of female and ethnic comedians, regardless of ability or merit.

&gt;Objectively then, there are comedians on panel shows who are there first and foremost because of their gender or ethnicity.

&gt;Some of these comedians are very good.

&gt;Because there is currently not a sufficiently large enough pool of female comedians with the requisite experience and ability to fill the quota, there are females who've been booked for these shows who are either poor comedians, not comedians at all, or aspiring female comedians that are still learning their craft, but have not yet reached a decent professional standard.

&gt;These females I have described as 'women-posing-as-comedians'.

&gt;The upshot of all that is that there are still many women coming across incredibly badly on panel shows, which is helping to perpetuate the myth that women aren't funny.

&gt;The hope is that women currently on panel shows, will further legitimise stand-up comedy as a career for women and encourage other women to take up comedy. Which is an admirable aim.

&gt;Unfortunately for every female who gets on a panel show, there are very many male comedians with more ability and experience who are not and will never get the opportunity to be on one. I think that's a great shame for TV audiences.

&gt;There are also male comedians who've been doing these shows for far too many years and have become incredibly stale, too lazy to move on to other things.Some of them are fat and balding.

That's interesting, could you say that dispersing the immigration would lower the anti-immigrant outlook? IT could be that people are worried because they see what some of the suburbs of london are like and don't want that to be their home, which is stupid but completely understandable as it's an instinctive reaction. 

I agree too, we should be more welcoming! But, interestingly and to use the Sweden example, their ""stereotype"" is being very cold and unwelcoming. SO couldn't believe how sociable we brits are to random people!

I have copied what appears to be the relevant section for you below, in case your on a mobile.

Basically, provide them with all the information you have, and ask them to reconsider the decision. If you have any evidence that supports your claim, you are more likely to get a favourable outcome. If that doesn't work, appeal.

**What if I donât agree with the decision to stop my benefit payment or end my claim?**



***Provide us with full information*** 

If youâre told your benefit payment may be stopped, or your claim may be ended, you should provide new information straight away about why you havenât attended meetings on time or taken actions. A DWP decision maker, rather than your work coach or employment scheme provider, will decide if you have good reason. If they decide there isn't good reason, they will decide how long to stop your benefit payment for, or whether to end your claim. You can ask why a decision has been made by calling 0345 608 8545. 


***Ask us to reconsider the decision***

If you think the decision is wrong, you can ask for it to be looked at again within one month of your benefit being stopped or your claim being closed. Explain why the decision is wrong and show any evidence you have. The decision will be looked at again and we will send you a letter to tell you what has been decided and why. We call this letter a âMandatory Reconsideration Noticeâ.

***Appeal***

If you disagree with the Mandatory Reconsideration Notice, you can appeal to a tribunal. You must wait for the âMandatory Reconsideration Noticeâ before you start an appeal.

We've had a return to actual character development and there have been consistent more adult philosophical themes running under the silly monster of the week conflicts. 

There were two episodes aimed a bit painfully at kids (Forrest and RoS) and one that was a complete failure (kill the moon). However, the show is about freedom and experimentation and both Kill the Moon and Forrest were at least trying out new experiments. 

I mean, I consider season 5 to be a great one but that included power ranger Daleks beaten by planes in space, way too many Rory deaths, and a completely nonsensical Weeping Angel two parter that shit on one of the coolest monsters.

""The fact is that AceStream contains one big vulnerability.

Acestream absolutely insists that UPnP is enabled. For that single reason alone, there is no way that I will allow it onto any of my machines.

UPnP allows firewall ports to be opened by applications without any confirmation/approval by the user. It bypasses even Administrator approvals. It is like leaving your house with the doors and windows wide open and advertising that fact with signs outside to attract thieves. It is an easy entry point for those that wish to do harm to your computer.

So this is not a question about any streamer being to blame. It is the absolute glaring weakness in the AceStream design.

Having it on your PC puts you at risk of attack. Don't just take my word for it, just search ""UPnP security"" in your search engine.""

Also there is not comeback or accountability for anyone in the House of Lords, indeed, despite election promises to sort it out, there are now MORE Lords in the house prior to when Labour came into power

http://news.sky.com/story/1315266/new-house-of-lords-appointments-confirmed

&gt;The Apprentice star Karren Brady and former Eastenders actor Michael Cashman are among 22 people who are to be appointed to the House of Lords.

&gt;Downing Street said the Queen had ""graciously"" signified ""her intention of conferring Peerages of the United Kingdom for Life"" on the 22.

&gt;It is understood they will receive their appointment in due course.

&gt;Also on the list is Sir Michael Farmer, the Conservatives' co-treasurer, who has donated millions of pounds to the party.

&gt;His appointment has led to accusations that the party is acting improperly by appointing someone to a position of influence after they have provided large amounts of funding.

&gt;Another name on the list, as previously revealed by Sky News, was Ranbir Singh Suri, the founder of Oceanic Jewellers.

&gt;Mr Singh ranks among Britain's richest Asians, with a wealth estimated at as much as Â£40m, and has also donated tens of thousands to the Conservatives.

&gt;Sky News had also revealed that West Ham United boss Ms Brady and former Marks and Spencer chief Sir Stuart Rose would be appointed to the upper chamber for the Conservatives.

&gt;Both were on the list along with another well-known businesswoman, Chief Executive of TalkTalk Dido Harding.

&gt;As also revealed by Sky News, former Facebook executive Joanna Shields is to become Conservative peer.

&gt;The Government confirmed the Chair of East London's Tech City and the Digital Advisor to the Prime Minister had made the list.

&gt;Labour's best-known peer appointee is Mr Cashman, who has been a Member of the European Parliament for the West Midlands since 1999.

&gt;Mr Cashman appeared in Eastenders between 1986 and 198,9 playing Colin Russell, a gay middle class 'yuppie' who became famous for having the UK's first on-screen gay kiss.

&gt;Mr Cashman, who was a founder of the pressure group Stonewall, has been praised for his public support for the gay community and the issues it faces.

&gt;The Conservatives appointed 12 new peers in total, Labour appointed three and the Democratic Unionist Party appointed William Hay, the former Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly, who will sit as a cross bencher.

&gt;Most of the six Liberal Democrat names were elected members of councils or former senior figures within the Lib Dem party.

false,AgentRigby,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"From my experience working in a phone shop, *from what you describe*, it sounds like you've been mis-sold the contract... but there is a lot of information missing here to accurately gauge if that is the case.

Depending whether you bought it in a shop or online/over the phone, there are different laws. There is no 14 day refund policy on in-store purchases, it only applies to distance selling. If this is your first bill, there is also the chance of 'bill shock'... depending on your billing cycle, and if it's been set up as a new contract (which if it was cancelled, would likely be the case), the first bill could in fact cover up to the first 2 months, but from the second bill onwards would be accurate. It is fairly difficult to rack up a bill on EE (capped data/unlimited texts/minutes... you're looking at international calls, roaming or MMS to do that), so I doubt it is due to overuse.

My advice would be to look over your contract, that's the biggest thing here. It should clearly state the tariff, price and everything else related to the deal on it. Does it match what you were told? Did you read over the contract before you signed it? If it states that you're on the tariff you believe, then Orange/EE are at fault, but if it states the Â£54 p/m tariff, then you should have checked the contract before signing it.

Something about this does seem off for me. Even though I didn't work for EE, the Â£54/m tariffs were only on the high-end phones and came bundled with 20 GB of data ([iPhone 6+ for example](http://shop.ee.co.uk/mobile-phones/pay-monthly/iphone-6-plus-16gb-gold/details)), and the most expensive Sim-only tariff is only Â£31 p/m on a 30 day rolling contract. They don't do 2 year Sim-only contracts. EE were VERY strict on their tariffs, and usually preferred an up-front price for the phone than a change in the tariff price, so it is highly unlikely this was a Sim-only deal like you state. (Which, if you did not receive the handset, could imply fraud.) Given that 4G would only really work on 4G capable handsets, it would be pointless to get a Sim-only EE contract using the same phone from a previous 2 year contract, as it is extremely unlikely the handset from 2 years ago would be able to handle the 4G (only ones would be specific LTE versions of some Android phones, or an unlocked [Apple-store bought] iPhone 5)

Either way, if they've mis-sold you the contract, go back into the store and complain. They will have an in-store customer service/fanatical support line who would have the authorisation to change/cancel the contract if the store are unable to do so. If you signed the contract stating the Â£54 p/m price, then they could simply just refuse to do anything.

If you have signed the contract without reading it, I would still go in to complain. While they are not obliged to do anything about it, they may decide to reduce the tariff as a goodwill gesture.

We used to have a lot of issues in the store I worked at where the customers broke the phones they got with their deal, had no insurance and demanded a new phone. When we told them we were unable to do that, they wanted to cancel their contract, not realising that their contract was for the service and not the handset. I'm not sure why, but this feels just like one of those times. If that is the case, you can get a Sim-free 4G capable smartphone for around Â£180, which would be your best bet in this situation. You'd still be able to continue using the contract, as cancelling the contract would require you to either pay for the handset in full, or returning it in full working order.

TL;DR: - Check your contract, go back to the store and complain. Depending on who's at fault, they may change or cancel the contract.",0,1414605839,null,0,false,0,clndo93,t3_2kod4v,t1_clndo93,t3_2kod4v,null,1426288596,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

He comes back on defense because Liverpool's D is shit, too often drifts out to the wings to chase bad balls, and just generally is a recipient of bad service. The only reason people are getting down on him so much is because he's the big name that can carry the bulk of Liverpool's(as a whole) struggles.

I think there is a serious chemistry issue between Skrtel &amp; Lovren, both are trying to be the alpha and it results in some awful cock ups. I prefer Skrtel &amp; Sakho and Lovren &amp; Kolo as a combination because it sort of defuses whatever anti-chemistry they have going on. Their names make nice portmanteaus as well... Sakhrtel and Kolovren. So there's that. 

Lovren has been shockingly poor, and it is not just a matter of settling in. The communication and chemistry could get better over time, but there is a lack of discipline and positioning to his game that I'm not sure will improve with time. 

Come January, it is seriously time for us to think about upgrading defensively. I hear all this talk about which top notch striker we will sign but I think that is absolutely ludicrous.

You must be joking. Do you live in such a bubble that you do not understand what true poverty is? Just 40 years ago children had to work in the mines to ensure their parents had enough money to give them FOOD. Many people didn't have enough money to afford enough coal to heat the water for a weekly bath. People starved to death or died from hypothermia in the winter.

And now you're saying you don't think a satellite dish represents wealth? People used to be too poor to be able to afford a newspaper, let alone a TV.

&gt; When the price of bread goes up and your wages don't, you are getting poorer.

You're thinking on an extremely short-term basis here. When talking about poverty you can't talk about a 5% bread rise in the past year. That's useless. Poverty levels are trends over decades. The recession is just a blip in the grand scheme of things.

I am one of the Conservative candidates for Yorkshire and Humber in this general election. Although we call ourselves Conservatives, we are nothing like the current real life party.

Throughout the last term, The Conservative party in opposition has delivered key promises from our manifesto. We have passed the Rape Anonymity Act Which ended the injustice of the press releasing the names of innocents whilst the case is still ongoing, reformed student finance making student finance more accessible to poorer students, whilst maintaining an internal market of degree courses, and passed a bill which wold give the UK a referendum on EU membership.

Although it's admirable that /u/googolplexbyte is focussed on decentralisation, I would like to point out that we also wish to decentralise from London and bring back power to the people. Me and the Shadow minister for communities and local government were actually discussing the viability of regional parliaments only a week ago.

That being said I would like to raise a few points.  Firstly I'm not actually suggesting we do this just that it is an interesting idea. Secondly as you mentioned taxes are essentially the same thing. Once you have earn a certain amount of money a percentage of the money you earn is given to people with less money. In addition you have the minimum wage which dictates how little you can pay someone. The only difference is this looks at individual organisations as closed systems. Also there isn't a cap on the amount of money someone anyone earns just that others in your organisation also earn more.

Newcastle, Villa, Stoke, and Hull were/are all easy teams for him to gain some run of form in the PL. Instead, its going to be given to Adebayor who is going to exhibit his fuck all mentality and, more than likely, barely contribute. 

I was more than excited about his reemergence last year but he's played 8 of our 9 games and has really only been decent/above average for 1 of them. So right now I would have to disagree with you in saying Ade is our best bet. Right now we think there is a potential striker solution in Kane and until Poch tests that, you can't say anything against him other than hypotheticals.

Again, the 'but' instead of 'than' means you're saying he was a midfielder. 

&gt; If the first team trusted him more as a CM doesn't that tell you something about what he was doing there?

That was your reply to me stating he played mainly as a striker at West Brom too and it insinuates that because he played CM for the first team in that position it must be his position.

&gt; You're not going to play him out of position, even only for 5 minutes.

Again, insinuating he has to be a midfielder because he wouldn't have been played out of position. Just a couple of examples.

&gt; But you, the expert on Izzy Brown's youth career at West Brom and Aficionado of all things Versatile

It's hilarious that you're trying to mock me with this comment but you don't realise you're doing the exact same thing, you are arguing just as I am, idiot.

&gt; You twisted the whole argument and nitpicked things instead of addressing the points I made. 

How did I twist the argument? You're the one who's constantly trying to divert things. You ask me why would Steve Clark play a youngster out of position on his debut and then later claim I'm looking at it the wrong way and not from a viewers pov, yet looking at it from that point of view wouldn't make sense in answering the question. You said various times that a youngster wouldn't get played out of position on his debut yet when I gave you an example like Ake you you decided to talk about a present day Ake and asked me what his debut has to do with anything, when it's completely relevant. Literally every relevant point you made I addressed, and it was you who then diverted away from it. Again, it was you who asked me why Steve Clarke would do this and then told me I should be looking at it from a viewers position. I don't think everyone around me is dumb, I think you're thick. Go and re-read these comments and tell who isn't comprehending what's being said, you're literally so fucking retarded it's almost painful. Btw, I don't actually think you're retarded.

It is rich, I know it's a quote from me. The part that is rich is the fact you're no different yet you try to mock me for it. Just because I came out and said I can't help but reply doesn't mean that you're any different because evidently you can't help it either, just because you haven't said it yourself.

Right, because 19th century trade unionism and chartism was a product of having loads of time on their hands. Come off it. 

This is what my generation tells itself for to excuse the laziness/apathy of so many of its own constituents.

I don't dislike Muslims (I teach in inner-city Leicester schools, some of which are 95% Muslim) but I find that there can be a lot of segregation between Muslim communities and other communities. I believe this is unhealthy for the country in the long run, though it's a difficult and complicated subject. 

I guess this could also be applied to other minorities/religions, though I feel that Sikhs and Hindu's have integrated a lot more easily into British society/culture. I guess a slight part of it is personal prejudice - I'm fine with head scarves (I have a lot of friends who wear them) but I dislike Burkas; I find it unnerving when I'm communicating with parents, etc. and I can't see any facial expressions.

So my reasoning for being worried about figures is my fear of exacerbating this situation. I welcome any discussion on it/anyone willing to change my mind though!

The emissions are due to the mining of uranium, which also releases radioactive dust into the local area. Solar panels have an average lifespan of 25 years... 

The waste is a scientific problem, you can't ""dispose"" of nuclear waste. There is no method of completely removing it. You have to store it at sites where it can be contained securely and without risk of it being released into the environment. Both storing and securing the waste costs a lot of money. I know they're working on fast breeder reactors that produce less waste, but it's still waste regardless. 

A better solution? Burning fucking wood for gods sake. If you burn wood with a CCS module installed, it's carbon negative.

I do. I believe that people should have the freedom to travel and live anywhere they like, through legal means. It's up to the government of their destination to decide how to proceed after that. 

&gt;Do you believe that native peoples are not entitled to homelands?

A native population does have a right to a homeland. But to deny the right for someone else to live there is something that I see as wrong, and rather isolationist.

&gt;Presumably then you're a supporter of colonialism, seeing as no people are truly entitled to any land anyway.

No, actually, I'm not. No government should have the right to invade/annex sovereign nations on the basis of taking control of it.

&gt;What does it mater who lives where or what native people displaced?

So, in relation to the article, what does it matter that she's getting benefits even though she was not born in Britain? Based on what you have said, the native British are not truly entitled to the land we live on. So why would we be more entitled to benefits by virtue of being natives?

&gt;What is so wrong about inflicting on a group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part?

It's funny because it's so fucking true. I've honestly been let down by every big event since they killed off Victorian Clara and introduced this Impossible Girl nonsense. Series 7 was all hype, massively underwhelming finale. The 50th anniversary let me down as did Matt Smith's send off. 

I just really, really wish they just kept with one Clara, which was the Victorian one. Everything worked, they got that Doctor/companion kiss out the way and the chemistry was brilliant. Then for no reason they killed her and oh look it's part of this impossible girl thing. They should have just cast a different actress for the Dalek Asylum and then just kept Clara as this bubbly Victorian lady. 

Instead we've had this let down of an arc (to the point where she even says her DESTINY was to save the Doctor. Give me a fucking break) and the fan theories end up being better than the actual finales. 

Capaldi has been brilliant.

I don't understand though why she thinks broadcasting should be completely devolved, I would have thought that's one of the things that should be kept centralised for efficiency. I can understand devolving some aspects of broadcasting, like giving the welsh assembly control over S4C (the welsh language channel) and likewise giving the Scottish government control over Gaelic broadcasting. In addition to that some more broadcasting powers could reasonably be devolved.

I'm more than happy to enjoy comedians of any race, but when the race, or terms of female stand ups, gender is the basis for 90%+ of your act, it can get kind of tiresome.  I've got no problem with comedy based around cultures different to my own, but when it feels like every punchline is 'because I'm black', it just comes across as lazy and no different to the others plowing that furrow.

Knowing that and therefore being justifiably suspicious of our risk perceptions we might (tongue in cheek) be suspicious that all human judgments of a particular risk as serious is therefore questionable. Or to rephrase; we might consider the risk of people overstating risks is serious... Wait a second :)

Seriously though if the risk being assessed is a low frequency and dramatic we are likely to overstate the threat posed. (You can test this by asking a small sample what the likelihood of dying by terrorism/cancer/road accident/Ebola etc the comparing the average with the stats. Ebola and terrorism overrated and cancer/road underrated) 

Inequality strikes me as a systemic potential risk rather than a one off so this mechanism is unlikely to be at play.

[Red Roaster](http://www.redroaster.co.uk/) is a great coffee shop if you want to stay still for a while. I have met a lot of amazing people there. Some quite strange people too.
If you happen to like rum I highly recommend the [st James](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g186273-d4340651-Reviews-St_James_Tavern-Brighton_East_Sussex_England.html). What perhaps is a bit surprising though is that they also serve really nice, and quite cheep Thai food. 
Another pub near there I really like but is a bit pricy is [the Black Dove](http://blackdovebrighton.com/). If you look at the pictures on the wall facing the bar you should see some framed parrot feathers - Those are from my parrot. 
If you happen to even vaguely like jazz I highly recommend going to the [Hand in Hand](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g186273-d3733945-Reviews-Hand_In_Hand-Brighton_East_Sussex_England.html) on Sunday evening.

Whenever person/society A draws a line in the sand beyond which they declare no one should ever step, there will almost always be a person/society B who will use that as an invitation to transgress. This is not a property of issues of race, by the way, but of language in general - if you make a rule, someone will break it. 'Nigger' would be the first and strongest example of this to spring to mind.

Cunt used to be roughly on a par with nigger (in fact in my youth when casual racism was the norm nigger was heard more frequently than cunt I think), but of course a cursory glance at almost any TRL comment thread will tell you that their impact has shifted and cunts abound but niggers are rarely to be seen.

And simply using the word doesn't make you racist ... but by god you'll get a fuckton of very disapproving looks and accusations of casual racism. I find it interesting that the term is grudgingly allowed to be used by certain black people, as if we can determine whether or not it's racist by first checking the skin colour of the speaker!

Still, it's just not a word I use other than in the context of discussing the word and its usage.

&gt;You've missed the point I was trying to make. Intentionally or otherwise.

So it would seem I have. My mistake.

We're not going through a cultural genocide, we're going through what has happened many times before and will happen again. Change. Cultures change. Cultures influence other cultures. Why do you think so many people can speak English? Because our culture has influenced others.

&gt;the British exist as an ethnic group. Much like the Swedes, or the Germans, or the Russians.

So immigration is diluting these ethnicities? And too much would mean the end of the British as an ethnicity?

What I am getting from this is that you would not want ethnicities to mix. I may be mistaken, but this is what I am seeing it as.

Okay, so the British exist as an ethnic group. Say I have a friend who has an English born father and a Indian born mother. Here you have two different ethnicities combining. Say that they decide to live in the UK. The ethnicity of the UK has now changed. Only a miniscule amount, but its still a change. 

We have different opinions and I appreciate that I will not be able to change yours and you, mine.

This isn't why people don't trust police, people don't trust police because they are manipulative, they lie, they look for any way possible to charge people. People don't ""read about it then make opinions"", people get fucked over by police, or have to deal with aggressive officers who think they have some kind of authority, or get told ""sorry, nothing we can do"" when reporting crimes, then make opinions. 

&gt;Thankfully, as much as you like to think you're smart, the majority of the public can see through that. Joe public is better at putting things into perspective than you...embarrassing.

As an officer living in your own little bubble, you would think that.

false,M2Ys4U,eu,Manchester,"&gt; the very real problem of countries like Peru and Bolivia being turned into war zones because the drugs cartels have become more powerful than the governments, largely funded by Western party goers.

I think the blame lies as much at the feet of the likes of Peter Hitcens as it does Brand.

The fact that drug takers are criminalised, and that governments all around the world have been pressured into prohibition and criminalisation, has also surely fed in to the fact that criminal gangs have become so powerful.

If you force such a huge industry underground, it is any wonder why criminals are the ones to rise to the top? And if you're a criminal just for being part of the industry, where is the incentive to operate within the law (or to behave well within society as a whole) when it comes to other aspects of your business dealings? Violence and intimidation are just as much part of the brands of the cartels as Corporate Social Responsibility is part of major Western corporations'.

I can't help but feel that full legalisation is the only way to tackle the problem in a systemic way. Allow *legal* drug production and supply to compete with the illegal operations. Regulate the market. Protect the legal businesses against recriminations from the illegal ones.

Obviously this is a *lot* easier said than done. We - as Western nations driving the supply - along with the rest of the international community have let the situation in the production countries get out of hand for so long now and as you rightly say, the cartels are more powerful and better funded than most of the governments in those countries. They will resist legalisation and regulation, and they will do so with force as it's just as much about power as it is money.",0,1414617695,null,0,false,0,clnkeyk,t3_2kpce7,t1_clnkeyk,t1_clnj19k,null,1426285413,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25944653

Not sure where you're going with link number two. Wages are down across Europe yes.

In regards to issues with wages and employment in the UK because of immigration, I'll cite the January 2012 report from the governments Migration Advisory Committee, that states:

&gt;âWe carried out our own analysis, examining the association between migration and native employment rates in Great Britain over the period 1975 to 2010. We found a tentative negative association between working-age migrants and native employment when the economy is below full capacity, for non-EU migrants and for the period 1995-2010. As a starting point for analysis, 100 additional non-EU migrants may cautiously be estimated to be associated with a reduction in employment of 23 native workers. But those migrants who have been in the UK for over five years are not associated with displacement of UK born workers. The change in the stock of the non-EU working age population between 2005 and 2010 was approximately 700,000. An associated displacement rate of 0.23 suggests that UK born employment was therefore 160,000 lower. Between 1995 and 2010 employment of non-British born working age people rose by approximately 2.1 million. Any associated displacement of British born workers was around 160,000 of the additional 2.1 million jobs held by migrants, or about 1 in 13. It would not be appropriate to assume the same impact in a time of strong economic growth, and further research and analysis of what to assume in such circumstances would be justified.â

This is an interesting talk on how inequality has harmful outcomes in society. I would contest that the very top super rich are all getting richer very quickly whilst everyone else is stagnating.

&gt; That's how you end up with a Miliband like government getting into power and we have another recession which inevitably hurts the poor more than the rich

It was my understanding that the last recession was caused by irresponsible lending in the USA by the already super rich in order to increase their wealth exponentially?

Think about if the tables were turned. Who is to say that white comedians may not be doing the same in Nigeria, or India? If you grew up in a country as a minority that is going to effect you. Why not play on hilariously caricatured relatives(like first generation emigrants/immigrants can be). I don't see why this material is off limits if it's done well.

Cetaphil does contain a sulphate surfactant which can cause problems for some skin types, SLS is known to thin and dehydrate even healthy skin at concentrations as low as 1%. Alternatives include either of the CeraVe cleansers (from Amazon), Simple Kind To Skin Refreshing Facial Wash or Boots Simply Sensitive Cleansing Wash Gel/ Foaming Cleansing Wash. If you are open to a different style of cleanser altogether I love NSPA skin renewal gel (exclusive to Asda, often 2 for Â£8) which starts as a gel, goes on as an oil and turns into a milk when you add water!

Do also consider the ingredients and effect of any shaving products.

Moisturisers for winter you might try something with ceramides, cholesterol and other skin friendly lipids. Again there are all the CeraVe creams and lotions on Amazon, 

Alternatives to CeraVe are few and far between, only the fairly pricey Boots No.7 Beautiful Skin night cream for very dry skin or the better priced NSPA night repair cream (exclusive to Asda, often 2 for Â£8). Both are a tad girly tho - the jar on the No.7 is, whereas with NSPA the white plastic tub is utilitarian, the scent is neroli (fruity) but the cream itself is pale peach.

To link in with /u/stufstuf/ suggestion of a humectant, the ultimate for dry skin IMO is urea. I know she will concur that Eucerin is a great line and fairly widely available, their 5% urea creams are really effective.

Do check out the sun protection post in the sidebar, our government doesn't blanket recommend sunscreen year round  (depends on the UV index) and dietary vitamin D intake is something you should consider. However if you do still want a suncreen there is the CeraVe AM lotion or Boots No.7 Beautiful Skin day cream for very dry skin.

false,theweltinator,silence,Silence,"I usually am annoyed by the bandwagons (""Clara isn't a real character"", ""the Prequels ruined Star Wars"", etc.) but I haven't liked Season 8 quite as much as I have the other seasons. In particular, Robot of Sherwood and Forest of the Night. 

The main plot point of FoN (trees that suddenly appear, can't be burnt down, and how they stop a solar flare from destroying the Earth) was pretty cool, but I hated the ending. I was thinking towards the end, when we knew the tress were good, ""I wonder if the human race is just going to cut them down afterwards, even though they know the trees saved them."" But no, they turn into space fairies and fly away, and the humans forget about them. I loved how through 9 and 10's seasons they slowly revealed aliens to Earth, and the human race had to accept that they were real. But now humans seem to be back to not knowing about or believing in aliens, even though that seemed to still be a thing back when 11 was still with Amy and Rory (Power of 3, specifically).

Now RoS. Too much tension between Robin and the Doctor. Yes, Robin was hitting on Clara (even though he goes back to Marian happily at the end) and the Doctor was mad at Robin for being real, but the Doctor doesn't usually get this angry at things he doesn't understand. Curious, sure, but not angry. That's more of a BBC's Sherlock characteristic (darn you, Moffat and Gatiss!) But in this episode, it goes way beyond that; he's acting like a jealous idiot, and it's pretty clear he's not interested in Clara in that way. Then of course, there were the obvious physics problems: the whole ""a gold arrow can hit an airborne spaceship hundreds of meters away, lodge into stone, pierce far enough through (or maybe the stone is conductive!) to complete a complex circuit, all the other parts of which had to be meticulously shaped and placed, and have just enough mass to be sufficient to get the spaceship into orbit, then explode before it can do anything else"", not to mention questions like ""how did the peasants with next to no knowledge of trigonometry manage to reflect lasers off of a bunch of plates and blow up heavily armed robots without any of them being killed by robots or each other?"" and ""why did the Sheriff have to blow up the door to get to Robin and the Doctor, who got in without a problem?"". 

I've liked most of the other episodes (Deep Breath and Time Heist come to mind, although Deep Breath has Vastra and Jenny telepathically connected, and the unnecessary slow-mo kiss) and the overall the season had been fine, but I've definitely liked previous seasons better.

This means, instead of being able to take short term jobs and temp work, you're going to have to find something that covers a week of nothing before it's going to be viable to take it.

I look at why we can't break down teams like Newcastle and West Brom at home, is it the midfield? Unlikely. Is is the striker? Yes. The lone striker needs to be leading the line, his position needs to be good, he needs to be available, his touch needs to be good and he needs to be able to pass the ball. These are skills that Adebayor seems to be lacking at the moment and on top of that he's hardly scoring many goals.

Those are your options, eriksen next to capoue probably wouldn't work he's even been quoted saying he doesn't like defense, and I see no reason taking any of them out if Kane can't play as a lone striker he probably won't end up in a pl game this season unless eriksen chadli or Lamela hit poor form.

Not do they feature better defenders in the league, but they each feature well-paid strategists who will clearly be able to identify that Lamela on the right is always going to cut in and look to play centrally. Lamela, despite all his talent, is indeed far too reliant on his left foot. If he can expand his game a bit by offering the threat of getting to the byline, I think this would open up the game considerably for both him and the rest of the team. 

But the point is, I don't think simply swapping Lamela to the left will solve the problem. Once we get more pace in the attacking positions, an actual fullback on his own side, get a more settled midfield that can get the ball forward more quickly, and stop being so damned anxious in our league performances, it shouldn't be so constricted for him playing from the right.
