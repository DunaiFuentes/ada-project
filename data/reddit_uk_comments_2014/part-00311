false,Xhysa,null,null,"First off, I would do some research into the pay for similar jobs in the area. (e.g. [Glassdoor](http://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/index.htm) but there are other ones I've used in the past that give good results.)

Secondly, don't shy away from discussing your compensation - it's a good indicator that you have a healthy self-image and are able to negotiate in a professional manner.

For this negotiation, I would highlight certain aspects of your CV which you believe entitles you to a salary in the upper end of what was advertised. This could be any relevant experience you've done, particularly good exam results, different ideas or approaches you have for the job - anything really which you believe sets you apart from other candidates.

There are other tactics you can use as well. For example if they're offering you a lower salary, and aren't budging, you could request that your salary is reviewed in 3 months, rather than 6 months or 12 months, or suggest a performance-based bonus.

This is all dependant on the interviewers though as they could be having a bad day or anything etc etc. They could alternatively be already planning to offer you what was advertised!

 I've personally never understood the ""Up to £x"" statement as its so ambiguous - A range is more helpful stating what they are looking for (e.g. £xk - £yk dependant on experience).

Good luck OP! Hope it goes well.

If everybody is happy, then we no longer have that variation that makes us human. 

Where there's violence, things can always change, but if there is none, then things may stay that way forever, which is far more terrifying to me.

However whether systems like the one about to pass can leave behind massive gusts of wind reaching up to 100mph that can cause damage to nearby buildings. Since Anfield is surrounded by old derelict homes this could become a safety issue leading to the game to be postponed.

It's odd but my friends who don't support Liverpool always argued that Gerrard was given a free pass in England. From refs, from announcers, and from fellow players. For a long time I think that was an overstatement or something not dissimilar to how other top English players get away with stuff.

false,crucible,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt; The French railways are hugely subsidised by the government. I agree, you can have both, but there's no way we're going to get both on HS2.
&gt; 

I suspect that this will prove to be the case once (if?) HS2 is built.

&gt; The French have another crucial advantage when it comes to trains generally and that's that they have loads of space. The TGV runs on its own tracks, we can't afford to do that (I mean HS2 is 1 train line and look at how many people got pissed off with that going near their house). So our high speed services have to mill around with the slow trains, HS2 will obviously solve this, but its one 1 line, connecting 3 cities, I mean, its hardly something to write home about.

Because we're decades behind Europe, China, Japan on this stuff. New infrastructure takes up space and nobody wants a road or railway built outside their house. Fair enough.

We have plenty of space though. Not as much as France, sure - but play with satellite mapping and zoom out a few clicks. Roads and railways disappear. The solution is finding a route for the new railway or bypass, or a location for the new supermarket that everyone will agree to - and that's the difficult bit.

NIMBYs rarely come up with alternatives to problems it seems.

&gt; Mainly though, we just don't fund railways. You can't have nice things if you don't pay for them

We're more content to sell the train operators off to the French, Germans, Dutch, whoever. Next up is selling our stake in Eurostar. Very short term thinking.

Heh, well if we're going to disagree on our perception of the quality of certain elements of his play, so be it.  And I won't deny being a bit of a Soldado apologist over the last few months, as well as the kind of guy who's happy to allow himself to be swayed based on the likability of a player he follows, and Soldado is certainly a likable guy.  Or, at least, presented as likable via Spurs' social media team.  But the Soldado I see when I watch our play seems to have far more energy and fluidity over the length of the match, when compared to Adebayor, is more likely to make runs and take risks.

Not to the degree or level of quality he should, undoubtedly, but I see the potential there.

I'm not the biggest fan of arguments about players being particularly suited to play in one nation or another; some players are more flexible than others, but I don't really buy that La Liga or Ligue 1 are so different from the Premier League that a player may be uniquely suited for a specific league and only a specific league.  What I do believe in, however, are narrative and confidence, and when a lack of goals - or, in Soldado's case, a lack of goals in conjunction with poor man management and tragic personal loss - persists for a while it's difficult to pull out of and start banging them in again.  I think we saw that confidence return during preseason (if you're the kind of person to put any value on performances during preseason), but then we did nothing with it and left him on the bench for two months of league matches.

Soldado's chances to perform when it counts have been so irregular, so inconsistent, that I don't think he's really had an opportunity to prove his mettle at all this season.  We fucked his style of play when we signed him, then we left him in the lurch at a critical time in our attempts to change his style, and now he's at risk of being labelled a true, unmitigated flop.  What I'd like is to really test the theory that he's a flop by giving him a full and complete shot to prove it wrong.

All that being said, I think Kane's future is *really* bright, and I'd love that future to be with Spurs.  I was looking for us to sell Adebayor this summer, and to see Soldado performing regularly with Kane as his regular backup and another striker brought in for cup appearances.  That wasn't to be, clearly.  If things go the way they've been, frankly, I can see Kane being our regular starter by 2015.  But if that's the way it's going to be, I'd like to know first that we didn't just ruin Soldado and then offload him for peanuts.

Looking forward, I would start Kane against Tripoli, with Ade on the bench, and give Soldado another start against Newcastle, with Kane on the bench.  Against Brighton, probably Kane again.

And the main point to take away is that even if in the long run we decide that medication is wrong, and it may take a long time, for how we absolutely have to listen to doctors. And the reality is they simply don't have a huge budget. They have to give more intense care to those who need it more urgently and less intense for those who don't. When people scaremonger about medication, it can create a culture of fear against it which may make somebody choose not to take it when they otherwise would. Add in the fact that mental illness can make you EXTREMELY paranoid about taking something an authority figure like a doctor has given you, and It means that people will be not getting care for illnesses that frequently end in death from suicide. 
 
I'm not saying you're wrong. There are obviously downsides. But it seems like you're treating it as something where everybody should be treated in the exact same way, and unfortunately mental illness isn't like that. Medication is a fantastic and useful tool. I love it. The best times of my post-diagnosis life have been when I've been on something. Including SSRIs. I'm more productive, happy, and less suicidal. I'm not cured, cos it's something that can be cured. But hey, for me it works better than therapy and regular exercise. And it's significantly easier than both. So fuck it I'll take them.

I stopped reading The Guardian many years ago - Perhaps a decade ago now.  This was long before Farage was a big deal in the way he is now.

Firstly, for at least the last three decades, The Guardian has been an extreme Left wing news source.  On top of this it was a paper that represented the opinions of what in the US would be described as champagne socialists.  The Guardian was never a voice **of** to working class.  Even insofar as it might have been a voice **for** them, it would have been so in the same sense as a wealthy person talking about how the poor should be carefully shepherded.

If you looked at the ads the guardian ran it would be for holidays costing upwards of £2,000 per person and luxury items that were ridiculously expensive.  The affluence of The Guardian's target audience manifests itself in the sort of campaign that leads to better conditions for farmed chickens.  Is keeping animals in better conditions a good thing?  Sure.  Is working toward this in a way that drives up the cost of food socialist?  Not as I see it.  But, hey if you can afford a £15 corn-fed, free-range chicken can't everyone? 

This is *(in my opinion)* why the Guardian's readership has fallen through the floor.  They don't really speak to anyone except their own affluent, extreme Left wing sector.  Couple that with the fact that the internet makes it incredibly easy to dip in and out of a number of news sources and The Guardian's business model ceases to be viable.",0,1413762232,null,0,false,0,cle54fo,t3_2jp0yz,t1_cle54fo,t1_cldshst,null,1426447438,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

If you take that, and add in the fact that doctors are very concerned about being accused of assisting suicides or plain old mercy killings today. Everything is tightly controlled, regulated and investigations are done (especially after Shipman). 50 years ago someone might be able to quietly ask the doctor to do the necessary because they both knew that granny wasn't going to get better and he could quietly give her a larger dose than usual without anyone else knowing. Today even a hint of that and someone is going to prison or at the very least will lose their licence. 

Lastly, as a society we're afraid of death. When it does happen we shy away from it. And because of our medical capabilities we're not really able to accept the words ""nothing can be done"". So there is an expectation that the doctors can do anything, and if they were to suggest that granny is 90, will never wake up and on the off chance she does she will be able to be more than 3m from a power outlet, and won't even be able to take a piss without medical intervention, so maybe it's time people said goodbye then there would be outrage.

I would like him to add more width to his repertoire, and I agree he doesn't use his right foot enough.  Then again, lots of players are tremendously one-footed, including people like Bale and Dembele.  But I do love how two-footed Eriksen and Mason are ... it's a real asset to their play, and for players like Aguero and Suarez, it takes them from ""damn good"" to ""fucking devastating.""

false,RuinAllTheThings,smith,Smith,"Have you ever been married?

I haven't. There was a girl, once. Her name was Brandie. She was sweet and kind - the sort of person who'd give a second chance even when you didn't deserve one. She was hopeful, thoughtful and when things got hard, she'd find a way to be the optimist. As a cynic, let me tell you, it was something amazing. We dated for a while. We were friends before -- friends after. 

Some awful things happened to me. I got sick. Pancreatitis. It was seven days of torture--and the nurses and doctors hardly had to do a thing. Agony was on the menu. My pancreas was essentially scarring over - not all of it, but a hefty portion of it. I had been drinking for three months - not at work? Take a shot. Home from work? Take a shot. Still awake? Take a shot.

That didn't last long. The agony was a horrific thing - something that belongs in a novel, if only the pain medication would let me remember anything beyond the pain and a blur. On the fourth night, Brandie called. We talked for twenty minutes. We'd been dating for a year and a half, and I'd done everything I could to hide the truth, and now she knew.

Now? She knew everything.

I don't know what was worse, honestly. Her knowing, my shame, or the complete torture I was in. I couldn't eat for eight days. Couldn't drink. I could crack ice between my teeth, that was it. Ice chips. That was what I had.

She called me. All I wanted was to hear her voice, you know? That kind of pain, that kind of.. agony. I knew her voice would sooth it. Even if it was just a moment. Anything to stop the pain, her voice was what I needed. She yelled. My voice was gone amidst the screams of pain and anger. Anger toward myself. How had this all happened? I had a woman who loved me, and all I could feel was what had happened in my past.

**Okay.**

This was from my youth. I knew Brandie for a long time--in fact, I still know her. She's my best friend. She's married, I am not. And you know what? That hill isn't so massive. And we dated for two years, that's it. Capaldi's been married **23 years**.

As for his commitment to the material goes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM2bXjs0n2g

It's very London centric. Yeah I know it's the capital but you don't see those busses, phone booths and funny hats outside of London. And how many crowns do you have? Too bloody many. And while we're at it, tone down the tea and pound symbols, it's just very generic. 

Perhaps include some other non-English British things, a picture of Robert Burns or some Welsh vallies. Include some rugby cricket and football, look at some of our cuisine (And not just fish and chips look up where the Balti was made). Get the other landmarks we have like Hadrian's Wall up.

Artwise, it's *okay*, nothing spectacular. Some of the pictures are vanishing behind the logo and it's a tad weird. But what you've depicted is lackluster at best. I'd say be ballsy and do something interesting no one else in class is going to do, maybe depict all English celebrates, musicians, or actors or something. But this just screams that you don't know Britain, or aren't afraid to show off what you know.

false,OnTheMirrorsEdge,eng-westmidlands,West Midlands,"Graphic designer here, here are my thoughts

First of all, you seem to have a good understanding of the software and this layout is a nice idea, well done! But there are a few things that I think you need to consider: 

1) Change it from the British Isles to just Great Britain, it's very incorrect and offensive to use the union flag to represent the Republic of Ireland and (to a lesser extent) the Isle of Mann.

2) The imagery in the background is far too London focused, add some imagery for Wales (The Wales Millennium Centre, a dragon would be a good way to get some more red in there) and Scotland (Unicorn, Thistle, Bagpipes, etc). Considering some non-London English landmarks wouldn't hurt either (Stonehenge, Angel of the North and Blackpool Tower for example)

3) Consctruction wise, this is pretty good, although try making the text around the map a bit smaller and with larger spaces between letters, this stop the eye being drawn away from the centre and give the text a bit more room to breathe.

Small side note: Adobe Illustrator is MUCH better for logo design than Photoshop, when you zoom in on this, the images in the background become blurred, this is because they're made of pixels, which results in fuzzy edges when you stretch it out. Illustrator works with lines, not pixels, and makes it much easier to stretch or resize a shape, you can get by with Photoshop, but try Illustrator if you get a chance.

One thing is certain: Mario is not scoring many goals but, as with Suarez in his first few months at LFC, I feel it's a matter of time before he starts scoring. 

For those who haven't been, Loftus Road is a very small ground (for Premiership standards), so one gets a very good view of what is going on. And, to tell the truth, I thought Balotelli did well. There were a few misplaced passes and some rather wasteful efforts (again, echoes of pre-monster Suarez) but generally, his work rate couldn't be faulted. He was running up and down, putting pressure on players and contributing defensively as much as he did offensively - I'd rate him as one of the better performers this match, although overall it was a dire team effort, this.  

He had some nice moments in terms of our build-up play and also made a few good through balls. Furthermore, he consistently created space for other players to run into. Why no one took advantage of this, particularly in the first half, is only something his fellow players and Rodgers can answer. 

So I'm not sure whether Shearer and I watched the same game, because the lazy uninvolved Balotelli he saw is not the one I was watching. 

Finally, what was a huge encouragement for me, the timing of his runs seems to be improving. There were several moments where a better pass from his team mates would have resulted in a dangerous position (although he was offside once or twice). Considering where his timing was a few weeks back, I was very pleased with what I saw. 

Work in progress, our Mario, but I think he is moving in the right direction. Provided he doesn't budge under media pressure and takes Rodgers' more constructive criticism on board, I'm still confident in what he can do for us. 

Now please do excuse me whilst I take the heart pills I am now required to take after that game... ",0,1413765722,null,0,false,0,cle6p8r,t3_2jqdcf,t1_cle6p8r,t3_2jqdcf,null,1426446701,21,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,21

As with the previously mentioned vapouriser conversation. You can have a lengthy conversation with people regarding bringing in legislation. But their end argument always comes down to ""I don't care anyway, I'm still going to do what I want"".

They don't care how it affects others, or even if legislation like proper labelling of foods could help others. A lot of people will simply ignore it. And because they don't think it should apply to them, they won't vote for it to be applied to others.

If you want a better understanding of the thought process of people like this, take a look at the recent thread on the suggestion of [banning smoking in public parks](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2javn3/ban_smoking_in_public_parks_lord_darzi/). There were a lot of people in there saying ""If you don't like it, then move out of the way"", like they have a right to openly emit poison in a public place and expect other people to move out of the way if they don't want to inhale carcinogens.

If you walked through a park with a spray tank on your back and pumped out cancerous chemicals and told people to move out of the way if they didn't want to get it on them, people would call say you were a god damned moron. But it's totally ok if it's smokers, because somehow it's different.

People like this will vehemently defend their right to do whatever they like, regardless of how it affects others. They'll even try to deflect the issue by saying that other things are worse, even though this is clearly a completely stupid argument.

Koeman has had his eye on Mane for a few years, so not counting Tadic and Pelle, was his main target. Long may not be a prolific striker, but his insane pace really fits well with our team, while the price tag is steep, he is starting to look like a very valuable player indeed.

With gelling,  most importantly Pelle and Tadic have been wanting to play with each other for years, and seem to be in-love with one another. Our midfield core was still there, Schneiderlin/Wanyama and Cork have been together for a couple of years, so no issues there, Koeman has just made them more potent infront of goal. Our back 4 has our captain in, everyone thought Lovren made Fonte look good, but in fact Lovren improved Fonte to his level, and he now runs our back line.

It's not as magical as people like to make out. Pelle is a great goal scorer, fuck the Eredivisie crap, that's rubbish. Same goes for Tadic, a player of his ability doesn't just lose it because he came to England.

It was just smart and educated buying by a very experienced man, and an already proven scouting system.

A species that is born to hate, lives hating and dies full of hate, going around murdering and torturing everything that isn't Dalek, forcibly converting anyone with even a slightly compatible genetic code into a Dalek and so on.

It's not like we're talking about holocausting the Jews here. They're the Daleks, ffs. Genocide is THE ONLY ANSWER.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not against body 'mods'.  I have a few tattoos myself including one that goes from my arm, over my shoulder and down my back. I even got nine piercings when I was younger, six in my ears, one in each nipple and one in my eyebrow.

But I also work as a high school teacher. I can take out the piercings, put on a shirt and blend in anywhere. I haven't excluded myself from 99% of the job market and am therefore far less likely to have to resort to government welfare payments.

If someone is going to have these extreme 'mods' done to their face then they should put some money aside to fix themselves up if they need to. Maybe the dive bar, factory or tattoo shop they work at doesn't care about the giant holes in their face or the Tweetie Pie tat on their cheek, but if that place closes then they need to clean themselves up and get a job doing something different.

I don't mind these 'mods'. Each to his own. Some of them are even interesting. But don't make society pay for your mistakes.",0,1413769229,null,0,1413771723,0,cle8bj4,t3_2jpclv,t1_cle8bj4,t1_cldyia4,null,1426445946,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

Here are the [progression steps](http://i.imgur.com/G0cS8bL.jpg) for this painting: 

I painted this for 3 reasons:
1. Inspiration - I saw the Youtube video of Foxes covering Queen's ""Don't stop me now"" song for the Mummy on the Orient Express episode of Doctor Who. [Source](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FxLR6cP1_Q8) I've always loved Foxes and was really inspired by Clara's beauty in the video clips.
2. I had time - I don't always have a lot of time to do artwork, but when I do, it's usually only a few hours at a time, so I took advantage of a 3-hour window to do a piece that I knew I could finish in that amount of time.
3. I like doing artwork. - It was just for fun. I wasn't trying to reinvent the wheel by doing this piece. I just saw something I liked and drew it, pretty simple really. :)

Tools I used: Cintiq 21ux monitor, stylus and Photoshop CS4. 

My website I use is [My Deviant Art Page](www.ayeri.deviantart.com)
I do Fan art, portraits of both animals and people, original artwork, architecture drawings, tattoo designs, traditional pencil drawings, and pretty much anything else that happens to pop into my head.

The drama was recommissioned for a second series, and the first episode was broadcast on 12 February 2014.  The second series achieved widespread public and critical acclaim,  and, on 8 April 2014, the BBC commissioned two further series.

*Cleanser*: Local, organic honey, or if I have worn makeup, emu oil cleansing with a microfiber cloth. (order online)

*BHA*: Salicylic Acid 2% pads from Garden of Wisdom (order online)

*AHA*: Mandelic Acid 5% no alcohol/no seaweed from Garden of Wisdom (order online)

*Other Acids*: Glycolic Acid Peel every few months through a licensed, certified aesthetician

*Essence/Serum/Ampoule*: Biologique Recherche P50V 1970. A godsend product that contains **niacinamide, salicylic acid and lactic acid** (order online)

*Moisturiser*: If necessary, Emu Oil (order online)

*Sunscreen*: Jan Marini Face Protectant SPF 33 (order online)

*Mask*: Pure **bentonite clay** from Aztec Secret (I think any bentonite clay will suffice - order online)

*Tools*: Microfiber cloth for oil cleansing

*Misc. Tips*: I eat tons of probiotics and fermented foods (pickles, saurkraut, kombucha), drink green tea frequently, and consume at least 2 L of water daily. 

*Regarding my routine*: 

AM: Honey cleanse, followed by Biologique Recherche P50V 1970. Emu oil if needed.

PM: If makeup was worn, I oil cleanse with emu oil, followed by honey. If no makeup was worn, I just cleanse with honey. 

Every 3 days (approx), I use a gentle BHA exfoliant (Salicylic Acid), wait half an hour, then apply my AHA (Mandelic Acid). The evenings that I use BHA/AHA acids, I *do not* use Biologique Recherche P50V 1970.

I use bentonite clay if I start to notice blackheads, which is rare.

4 years ago when I was 15 I was playing AAA hockey. One day in a game, I took a nasty hit and my knee twisted the wrong way. It hurt like a bitch and the moment it happened I knew something went wrong. Turns out I tore my ACL. I had surgery and was out for 9 months. Said I should be glad to walk again, it was a really bad tear. I missed my possible chance to get drafted to the OHL since I was out the whole year with the injury. I was devastated but I wanted to get back into hockey. After getting clearence from my doctor to do physical activity, I started to run again. At first it was minor distances like 1/2 mile to a mile but after about a month or two I managed to get back to my normal 5 mile run. Then I moved to the ice, or in your case the field. Just practice shooting and passing, all the basics. Just run a normal practice w/o the tackling. Finally, after months, I made a AAA midget team. I was never the same player, used to be a second line player but since I had dropped off so much, I was a fourth liner. Was I scared to get back into playing? Terrified. I took short shifts and avoided the hitters. Actually I was placed on a lines with goons to protect me. Could I still do everything that I used to be able to? Yes. Except my speed was never the same. I was much slower but I could still play.

Point is, I took the risk. I just couldn't stand being away from it. Is it going to be scary when a guy comes in for a tackle? Hell fucking yes it will be! Just take it slow at first getting into it, don't come onto the field thinking you have the pace of Bale or the skill. You just came on a big injury. I personally have never heard of too many people re-tearing their ACL, I mean look at all the athletes who have torn their ACL and came back to the sport. 

Man, just take the chance. If it scares you, don't do it. Nerves are guaranteed. Just have to face your fears. I know what you are feeling right now. Good luck man!

But this is because it's still illegal (in most cases).

The ethical standards - the ""power over life and death"" - have derived from Judeao-Christian culture. And yet weirdly they've evolved from ""don't kill"" to ""keep alive at all costs"" - as you point out - which is frankly as much playing-god as upping the morphine more quickly.

I do agree that we are afraid of death.  We just don't see it. Read old novels, when infant mortality was higher, and people's differences in approach were just shocking.  Another child or sibling died, you were expected to just carry on. Today there are months and even years of counselling to cope with it.  

And sure - the loss of one child if you only have one or two children - that's huge, compared to having a dozen and not expecting most to survive.  I also expect people in days gone by were far saddened, if not traumatised, by death that is disclosed by the records we have.

&gt;The __Roman conquest of Britain__ was a gradual process, beginning effectively in AD 43 under Emperor [Claudius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudius), whose general [Aulus Plautius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aulus_Plautius) served as first [governor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governors_of_Roman_Britain) of [Roman Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Britain) ([Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language): *Britannia*). [Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain) had already frequently been the target of invasions, planned and actual, by forces of the [Roman Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic) and [Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire). In common with other regions on the edge of the empire, Britain had enjoyed diplomatic and trading links with the Romans in the century since [Julius Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar)'s expeditions in 55 and 54 BC, and Roman economic and cultural influence was a significant part of the British late pre-Roman [Iron Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Age), especially in the south.

You can imagine how much Chelsea would love to take three points in Old Trafford on Sunday, which is why, despite everything I've wrote above, I believe Costa plays.  If he doesn't, then clearly, there is much more reason for concern, and we may not see Costa until our trip Anfield.

I think the amount of new faces in the squad is what is making our displays a bit......... boring and uninspired. The signings we have made are good, but we shouldn't be trying to shoe-horn them all into the team just because we can. 1 or 2 at a time, then some on as subs etc until they are up to the pace we were at last year.  
We started with Balotelli, Lallana, Can, Lovren. All good players, but not yet in tune with each other or the squad. I know 'you have to play together to get in tune with each other' But so many new faces makes it harder for you.
As soon as Coutinho and Allen came on, Sterling was making his usual runs and being found by Coutinho, Allen was everywhere and other players knew where to expect him.  
This isn't a rip into any player, just what i think is causing our abject displays right now. No-one player particularly bad... except maybe Mario who could have done better on a lot of occasions, but seemed to not care. He definitely needs a strike partner. At City, and to a lesser extent AC Milan he always had someone close to him either dragging defenders away or opening up the space for him, which I think Borini would be quite well given the chance.

What you can't really do is just walze into professional productions and still wear a ring despite your character not supposedly having it. That's either sheer stupidity or just plain disrespect towards fans.

Since I however have some trust remaining that Doctor Who is in fact professionally produced show, I imagine they do have a scripted reason for the Doctor to wear a ring. It may have stemmed from actors request to keep the ring on. But since most people in this thread seem to prefer to pretend that's not the case, that this is just vanity on part of Capaldi, then above point remains: It's either stupidity or disrespect towards their craft and their audiences.

I would react similarly if on-screen Capaldi started talking about his wife and how he loves her. Sure it's endearing that he loves his wife, but Doctor Who episodes are not time or place to demonstrate that love. That's kinda what being professional means, you act like what you do matters.

IT's all fueled by fairly sudden traumatic events themselves creating trauamatic memories, just having a bit of a hard time might hurt someones mental state, but its not going to cause PTSD.

THis is the internet, people threaten to rape and kill as a matter of course, annoymity makes people insufferable assholes. However, even if a person was amazingly unthicked skin, its just not the same as seeing a loved one die or knowning a loved one has died and thinking there was something you could do about it. That's the big driver of PTSD.

&gt;I stated that PTSD was plausible as in 'within the bounds of possibility'. We can't deduce the veracity of her claims over the internet. This the important thing, the ruminations are not likely to come about because someone threatens your life. It's having to play the same set of memories over and over because you felt you could have done something different over and over in some event or set of events that causing you a fair bit of grief.

The same complaint has been being made for around the last two and a half thousand years:

&gt;“Our youth now love luxury. They have bad manners, contempt for authority; they show disrespect for their elders and love chatter in place of exercise; they no longer rise when elders enter the room; they contradict their parents, chatter before company; gobble up their food and tyrannize their teachers.”

&gt;-Socrates

You'd probably approve of Keith Joseph's take on it in 1974 too:

&gt;“A high and rising proportion of children are being born to mothers least fitted to bring children into the world. Some are of low intelligence, most of low educational attainment. They are unlikely to be able to give children the stable emotional background, the consistent combination of love and firmness. They are producing problem children. The balance of our human stock, is threatened.""

Alas, the, *""actual decent people can barely afford the money or time to have kids.""*  It's like the fucking end of times is upon us.  Just like they have been for the last two and a half millenia.

An acute life-threatening traumatic event is the 'classic case' but certainly not the only cause. In fact, symptoms of traumatic stress around found also to arise from an accumulation of ""small"" incidents (bullying, domestic violence, emotional abuse, physical abuse, stalking etc.) - in other words - from chronic events. There's a lot of research done on PTSD in recent years. See below. 

&gt;A general non-specific anxeity disorder maybe, PTSD no. 

You've made up a distinction. To which ""general non-specific anxiety disorders"" you're referring to and how do they differ from PTSD? PTSD itself covers a wide range of symptoms with varying degrees of severity. Would you be comfortable to say that she could have 'Complex PTSD' aka 'developmental trauma disorder'?

&gt;It's just not how the condition forms.

Scientific literature does not agree with your statement.

&gt;The unionist vote is not split in any substantive way in the marginal constituencies where they're discussing pacts.

Well the last election in FST were we both ran candidates, 05, the combined vote was higher, so it's a legitimate concern, the independent candidate in 2010 lost by 4 votes so it's winnable.

&gt; Belfast North as an example, given it's the seat the UUP are offering up.

It may not be a substantial split but it's certainly unhelpful.

&gt; From a quick look at Wikipedia, since 1990 there has never been more than two main 'unionist' parties in the Westminster constituency (UUP &amp; Conservatives, later UUP &amp; DUP), along with the two main nationalist parties and, on some years, a few 'others' (Alliance, Green, Workers party, Rainbow Dream Ticket etc). So the amount of diversity  is pretty much identical on both ends of the spectrum. 

Yes, fair analysis, but we still don't know what the TUV and UKIP are doing, UKIP haven't ruled out any pacts but that still leaves the TUV.

&gt;Indeed, the degree of splitting in the vote is actually greater on the nationalist side than on the unionist side (here roughly defined as the ratio of lead unionist or nationalist party's vote to all votes on that side).

&gt;Running a unionist unity candidate in Belfast North would be an attempt to *create* an unrepresentative situation, not prevent one. The situation is even worse in FST, the seat the UUP want in exchange, where they're trying to paper over an ~8% defecit between unionism and nationalism.

Fair enough there is a deficit in FST, the last election was won by 4 votes and the SF gains was nearly identical to the SDLP loses, and the question is about that 7.6% that still voted SDLP, why didn't they vote tactically against unionism? Is it Sinn Fein's policy of abstention? There was a majority voting on favour of having a sitting MP, and all their (sf) lobbying did nothing to halt welfare reform.

I don't think it's his political leaning, so much as:    
a.  His age.    
b.  The fact that he has money.

Immigration was encouraged after the second world war.  Immigration after WWII was hugely beneficial.  He's in his seventies, so he's old enough to have lived through that period.  

Immigration increases the workforce.  An increased workforce first reduces pressure on employers and then creates a market where excess in the workforce pushes down employment costs.  If you've got a few quid to throw around and you want to hire a cleaner, or get a builder in to build an extension on your house, or hire a nanny...  

Immigration makes these things cheaper.  Even better, there're a bunch of people clamouring for each job.

I observed that at any time of day, year-round, there was a cloud above the power plant, therefore it was always casting a shadow somewhere near the power plant. i.e. the output of the power plant reduced sunlight levels in the local area.

Johnny Ball introduced me to the process of scientific reasoning before school got around to it.  Although I didn't end up working in a scientific field I ended up doing three A-Levels and a degree in that area.  Although I'm not a scientist that model of reasoning serves me well in my job daily.  I genuinely believe that a not insignificant part of how I think and therefore who I am is a result of learning with Johnny Ball as a kid.

At least up to a couple of years ago he was still guest lecturing at venues like universities!

However, a few years ago he came out as a **[climate change denier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-R3-GeQut4)**.  There's a short clip of one of his videos in this.  It's not the one I originally watched, because it doesn't cover his arguing that CO2 emissions aren't an issue.  In the interview he covers this a little.

That said, you have to admire the fact that at 73*(ish)* at the time of that interview he could argue so coherently and with such passion.

* Spyderco UKPK in Black FRN. Plain edge leaf blade (like [this](http://edcforums.com/threads/spyderco-ukpk-frn-knife-review-56k-beware.80547/) but in black) CTS BD1. Older style without tuning fork spring. Spring is a bit soft but maybe that's just because I'm comparing it to my G10 version which is snappy like a crocodile.

* Three working but rusted feuerhand lanterns [like this one](http://www.thebushcraftstore.co.uk/feuerhand-storm-lantern---the-original-german-lantern-and-the-best-3779-p.asp). Postage probably quite pricey. Happy to trade for all sorts of things, try me. One is missing glass globe I think. Also another no-brand smaller red one, working too.

* TAS Tactical rapid access first aid pouch like [this one](http://www.sierraalphasupplies.com/index.php?route=product/product&amp;product_id=321) but in plain khaki. Good item, barely used.

* Maxpedition EDC Organiser. Barely used, but zipper rubs on the inner lining. Fine if you're not opening and closing all the time. I used to use it for a first aid kit pouch.

* Emberlit stove. Heat-discoloured but otherwise in great shape.

&gt;In Denmark, pay and working conditions are typically laid down by collective agreements concluded between trade unions and employers' organisations. This system of labour market regulation is referred to as the Danish Model. 

&gt;The Danish Model is characterised by the fact that it is the social partners themselves that determine the rules of the game on the labour market. The philosophy is that the social partners are in the best position to know what the problems on the labour market might be. This means that they will also be the best at finding quick solutions and adapting to the current challenges on the labour market.

Sorry about the source, but UKIP have removed them from their websites. 

The relevant passage: 

&gt;UKIP would put an end to most legislation regarding matters such as weekly working hours, holidays and holiday, overtime, redundancy or sick pay etc and provide a statuatory, standard, very short employment contract template....

Then a little later: 

&gt; It would be up to each employer to decide whether to offer parental leave and this would be one of the items included in the standard employment contract (see above)

This isn't ancient history, this was published in January 2013. They go on to attack employment tribunals/law (limited liability for discrimination, because yay the 70s or something?), remove protection from pension funds, and a load of tax breaks for pensions saving (which is odd as it would result in double, sometimes *triple* taxation on the same income). Their flat tax proposal (31% flat rate, 20% on pensions, £11.5k threshold). 

That it has been removed from their website may mean that some or all of the policies have been scrapped... but the regularity with which they do this stuff speaks volumes to me.

MYTH - BRITAIN WILL LOSE ALL INFLUENCE IN THE WORLD BY BEING OUTSIDE THE EU

Britain has a substantial ‘portfolio of power’ in its own right, which includes membership of the G20 and G8 Nations, a permanent seat on the UN Security Council (one of only 5 members) and seats on the International Monetary Fund Board of Governors and World Trade Organisation.

The UK also lies at heart of the Commonwealth of 54 nations. Moreover, London is the financial capital of the world and Britain has the sixth largest economy. The UK is also in the top ten manufacturing nations in the world.
Far from increasing British influence in the world, the EU is undermining UK influence. The EU is demanding there is a single voice for the EU in the UN and in the IMF, The UK has already had to give up it's seat at the World Trade Organizaton for the EU. The EU has also made the British economy and City of London less competitive through overregulation, and negotiates more protectionist and less effective trade deals on behalf of the UK.

The new European External Action Service (EEAS) and its EU ‘Foreign Minister’ Baroness Ashton are undermining national diplomatic representation and the furtherance of British political and commercial interests through British embassies, which are being closed or downsized around the world.

The Commonwealth is increasingly discriminated against by the EU policy on visas, so that non-EU Commonwealth citizens face having to obtain visas whilst citizens of even new EU entrants have automatic entry, and bonds with Britain are being lost.",0,1413799185,null,0,false,0,clehdht,t3_2jrl34,t1_clehdht,t3_2jrl34,null,1426441661,-6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-6

We simply do not put humans down because they are retired and a burden or because they have nowhere to go and noone to look after.

You may argue that these are not good enough, immoral, reasons for euthanasia in animals. And you'd have a good point. Its nice to think that most pet owners put their animals down out of compassion but the reality is some don't, some also do it for selfish and ghastly reasons. Some institutions do it for economic and financial reasons.

The point I'm making is the same could happen to people, people could be exploited and pressurised against their will. Old people could be disposed of by family members who don;t care about them and see them as a drain. It is not generally the principle of euthanasia which stops people putting into to law but the safeguards to ensure people are not killed against their will.

false,Patch86UK,,Labour Member,"&gt; Worried about low-paid workers coming to your country? Why not have a EU-wide minimum wage? 

That's an interesting topic, which is discussed in that other article I posted this morning. A single minimum wage across the whole EU wouldn't really be workable (applying the current UK minimum wage to Romania would flat out crash their economy), but in the past the EU Parliament expressed a desire to a) mandate that every member nation had a minimum wage, and b) that the national minimum wages should be tied to a useful benchmark (e.g. ""x% of the median wage""). 

Long story short, it'd be good if the EU mandated that every country/region had a minimum wage tied to the local living wage equivalent. That would do as you say and take the pressure off of immigration (since getting a living wage in Romania should prevent the crushing poverty that makes someone want to uproot and move 1000 miles to scrub foreign toilets).

Sadly, the EU Parliament has rather dropped the subject since the crisis. Wage ""moderation"" is the order of the day now (i.e., real term reductions to make workers ""more productive"" when compared to abroad). Couldn't tell you if that's a good thing or not, but it's sad that the above solution to the immigration issue is now off the table.",0,1413800437,null,0,false,0,clehl9e,t3_2jrrl3,t1_clehl9e,t1_cleh7cq,null,1426441490,2,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,2

You've been on shift for twelve hours and want something to eat now? Too bad. Then be able to do time investigative units and all the rest of it. I really disagree with them having gotten rid of less than 5s because the job are much more willing to take the mick now in a way they weren't before.

What I'm saying is that police officers as a rule work damn hard for the money they're paid. Its not a cop out. Also train drivers earn more than a top whack constable does so there are jobs out there which do have good job security, pay more and don't require a degree. 

Again post winsor we're all going to be put into the same pension scheme which is going to be pay a lot more in to get considerably less out and you don't have a choice.

Make it so investors, not employees, pay the cost for crime. Make the fines so high that even the fear they might get caught will make corporate ethics a required course.

false,gamas,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"That article is so wrong that it gave me an aneurysm.

For starters, uniformitarianism is the idea that the natural laws and processes of the universe that operate now were true in the past and apply everywhere. The reason this is adopted by scientists is because unfortunately we are unable to have physical observations of the past ourselves. (There is also the part where everything we see today was the results of gradual processes that occur on earth, however most scientists now agree that there is periodic catastrophe as well causing radical change)

&gt; For example, when a modern geologist sees a massive canyon with a tiny river running through it, he assumes that this tiny river carved out the canyon, and of course, that would have taken millions of years. This assumption is based on a particular philosophy which has become the predominant one and so the assumptions are taken as facts. They aren’t facts, they are assumptions, based on the philosophy that “the present is the key to the past”.

No that's really not how it works. A geologist *proposes* that the tiny river carved out the canyon.  The reason they make this proposal is because they observed that water is capable of erosion, and logically applying this observation can suggest that the canyon was the result of millions of years of erosion. Another scientist may discover another cause based on other observable factors. The scientific method is considering all possibilities and choosing the most probable based on what is currently known.

&gt; By believing in uniformitarianism, the scientist is presented with a big problem. He has to make the evidence fit the philosophy.

No, again it doesn't work like that. It's not that the evidence has to fit the philosophy.  The philosophy has to fit the evidence. The reason we assume the natural laws and processes of the universe have always been true, is because there is no evidence to suggest that there was a point when they weren't true. If the model doesn't fit the theory, then that means the theory needs reconsidering. That is the scientific method.

&gt; All the information for wings is still in the beetle’s DNA, so that, if some time in the future these wingless beetles were seen to have sprouted wings, it is only because a mutation caused the gene to be switched on again. No amazing, very gradual, process has happened over millions of years to produce these complex wings. The information was there all along.

That's.... simply not how evolution works.  Whenever an offspring is conceived, there is a chance that this offspring will have a mutation. For example you can have a baby born with extra fingers, or a dude with two dicks. Most of these mutations will stay rare as they either offer no survival benefit (what the fuck can you do with an extra finger) or make your chances of survival worse (being born without limbs isn't good).

However, occasionally the mutation will occasionally be something that increases the offspring's survival chances, especially if the environment is changing. If you're a peppered moth in the 18th century, having white wings was more advantageous since when resting on white bark, you would be almost invisible to birds.  However, when the industrial revolution came, pollution meant that most of this bark was covered in soot and was black.  Suddenly the peppered moth lost its evolutionary advantage as their white wings were easily seen amongst the bark.  Some of the offspring had a mutation that made their wings black. Whilst before they were the minority since they were caught easily, now they were invisible against the soot covered bark.  Because the white wings were being killed off, whilst the black wings survived, the black winged peppered moths became the dominant population.  Now that we've started cleaning up the environment, the tables have turned again and once again the white-wings are more dominant.

Cancer is a bad mutation, hereditary diseases are bad mutations.  Double-jointedness is a neutral mutation (i.e. something that doesn't cause problems to a person's survival, but doesn't improve their survival either). A positive mutation is evolution.

To take a more down to earth analogy that people can be familiar with.  At one point both Betamax and CDs were competing mediums for storage.  Eventually CDs won out, and Betamax died.  This is pretty much how evolution works. New mutations are happening all the time, some of them survive and dominate the population, others die out.

But, the British have their own traditional candy (ie 80s/90s candies). When was he born? You could try getting him some traditional American candies from the 90s too. Can't say I see them around very often here. 

And just to humor myself, one thing I know I can't find easily here are freaking paper napkins. I roamed through all of Tesco and Asda and only found napkins at the party supply section. Growing up in two different countries where paper napkins are a norm even for home meals, it's bizarre that they aren't a norm here in the UK. I asked my British boyfriend what he does to clean when he gets something on the outside of his mouth when he's eating his meals, and he just kind of looked at me as if I  just spoke a foreign language. But then he paused and said something like ""I don't know, my sleeve? Or just don't eat wrong."" And I was like ""But when we go to restaurants, they always give us napkins, most of the time it's fancy paper ones."" Then next time we went to a restaurant he was like ""Oh yeah, you're right! They do give us paper napkins."" I didn't understand how he never realized it and I still can't understand why he and his family don't have napkins for meals. Naturally, my mom thought it'd be funny if she packed my dad's luggage with 2 huge packs of paper napkins when he came to visit a few weeks ago. 

And I'm assuming it's the same deal with most of the UK as I went to supermarkets in both the midlands and southern Scotland so far and paper napkins are still rare unless you go to the party supply section. 

I suppose though on the other hand, paper napkins can be quite wasteful if you go crazy with them. But I'd be ok even with fabric napkins. But those aren't really the norm in the US either unless you go to a restaurant.

Edit: And after looking it up, apparently in the UK you call paper napkins: serviette ?

The G8 seems to be largely irrelevant nowadays, particularly now that Russia has been suspended from it.

It is mostly only concerned with economic stability anyway.

&gt; a permanent seat on the UN Security Council (one of only 5 members)

For historical reasons.  It wouldn't surprise me if the Security Council undergoes major reform at some point.

&gt; seats on the International Monetary Fund Board of Governors and World Trade Organisation.

Almost every country in the world has a seat on the IMF Board of Governors and membership of the WTO.

&gt; The UK also lies at heart of the Commonwealth of 54 nations.

The UK doesn't have any more control over the Commonwealth than any other member, and the Commonwealth barely does anything anyway.

&gt; Moreover, London is the financial capital of the world 

Debatable.  It depends how you measure it, but a lot of measures seem to put New York at the top now.

Again, this depends how you measure it.  By some measures the UK is 10th, and it will almost certainly continue to fall down the rankings as some of the bigger developing countries outpace it.

Source?

&gt; The UK has already had to give up it's seat at the World Trade Organizaton for the EU

This is because the EU is a single market and acts as a single bloc when it comes to trade negotiations.

I hear people criticise the government a lot here. Sometimes they do things that seem ridiculous to me. In fact the only way I can rationalise it is by thinking they don't give a shit about poorer people. 

I'm not saying that's the correct rationalisation. Rather, I don't think the government does enough to explain its decisions to the public. Whether that's calculated or not I have no idea.

Unfortunately it seems the media don't, calling persistent harassment and threatening behaviour, ""trolling"" makes light of a real issue.

Threats to kill have been a crime since at least the Offences Against the Person Act 1861.

""A person who without lawful excuse makes to another a threat, intending that that other would fear it would be carried out, to kill that other or a third person shall be guilty of an offence and liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years.""

And the law has been updated with the Protection from Harassment Act 1997.

""A person whose course of conduct causes another to fear, on at least two occasions, that violence will be used against him is guilty of an offence if he knows or ought to know that his course of conduct will cause the other so to fear on each of those occasions.""

The fact that the media has moved from writing letters to tweets hasn't made it anymore socially acceptable, or suddenly made this activity legal.

false,fjrichman,null,null,"Personally this version of the Doctor reminds me a bit of the older Doctors. Specifically he has a stand-offish attitude similar to what we see from Hartnell before the Doctor fully starts caring and ""liking"" companions. 

I also feel like some of his attitude is similar to that of Baker as the 4th Doctor. You get a feeling that he wants to care but at the same time he's dismissive of those around him. 

The mixture of these two attitudes seems to create in my opinion what you see in Capaldi currently. I feel however that once the Doctor moves past this ""uncaring"" which I believe he will at some point, that he could be a lot more like 4 as a Doctor, a mixture of confidence and light heartedness. He has that same sort of confidence that Baker brought to the Doctor and he Capaldi has that potential to bring lighter comedic touches to it similar to many of the other Doctors.

Potential Spoilers beyond this point:

Both Tenant and Smith have these moments where they have the same sort of disconnect. However because they happen in the middle of their time as the Doctor it sort of felt out of character for them. You hoped they'd get over it and return to how they were before.

For Tenant this was more noticeable during the specials peaking with his Time Lord Victorious moment.

For Smith this is seen a bit more spread out over his time as the Doctor. We see a bit of it in the episode The Beast Below where the Doctor questions his ability to continue being the Doctor with the decision he has to make. We see it again when he becomes recluse from the world in the Christmas special The Snowmen.

Capaldi's Doctor just happens to be all this coming to the front of his personality as he's trying to figure out what sort of person he is. Things like asking if he's a good person, of people who are suppose to know him. He's spent thousands of years being the hero, saving the world, etc. However from his time as the War Doctor up until the moments in the 50th where he choose to do otherwise he's lived with the guilt of being the destroyer of not one but two species (though somehow the daleks were far more persistent at coming back than Time Lords?). 

That's a heavy weight to carry, even if he realizes after making the decision to save Gallifrey that he saved his people which would have happened during the Christmas Special, he still has lived with that guilt long enough for him to be tainted by it.

Now he also has to live with the fact that he could have brought his people back and didn't. The fact they give him a new regeneration cycle probably doesn't help that mindset at all. He gets to live, his people who until recently he thought were dead are still trapped. He has no clue where they actually are (the chalk boards are probably him trying to figure it out) yet he knows they saved him.

The darker emotions everything he's felt has come out more in this regeneration. Over time it'll probably be leeched out and he'll become a friendlier and caring version of the Doctor, but for now he really needs a therapist or a really good companion.

Clara hasn't been able to help this Doctor I think because she's suddenly dealing with her own issues. She spent quite some time with the previous regeneration, and I don't think she's adapting as well as previous companions have. She keeps wanting that older version of the Doctor (like many fans maybe?) and the 360 change from the carefree caring Doctor to the serious uncaring Doctor is too much for her ultimately.",0,1413804678,null,0,false,0,cleielr,t3_2jr1ib,t1_cleielr,t1_cledinu,null,1426441109,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

The stage was set the opposition was ripe for the picking (while that might be disrespectful and their performance was exemplary, they really should have had something from the game after all was said and done). We were playing the team which started the season poorly, was missing some of it's starters, Mario had ample time to adapt to his new team and what his manager expects from him was probably drilled into him day after day. I'm not saying that's enough and it clearly was not. I admit I had mixed feelings when I heard we're signing Balo but I genuinely want him to succeed, to prove his talent and realize his potential at the club I've supported for so long.

What upset me the most was his attitude. The early signs were bright, he made a fine run into the box, completely uncharacteristic of his performances up till yesterday's match. Yet after he was (rather easily) dispossessed it all nose-dived. After one failed attempt it looked like his shoulders slumped and he went into a state resembling sulking. When we conceded he had been getting over a poor challenge by Dunne, when Dunne scored the own goal he wasn't 100% present to his surroundings, his missed chance could've put the game to bed for us ffs! Yet in all those moments I found him to be wanting. So far he hasn't proven himself to be a Liverpool player, nobody will convince me he's given it all to the cause on the pitch and tried his hardest, constantly attempting to improve and do better. No way anyone, not even Mario himself can sell that to me. And that's what upsets me.

It's like he's here almost because he has to be and not because he wants to be. Sure he went on about how he wants to return to England and how he's excited to be part of Liverpool, but come on! Don't tell me he's been as present during each match as he could've been. I don't ask for him to go scoring hat-tricks in a CR7 fashion or outplaying defenders in the manner of our most recent #7 but I do fucking want him to at least try to give it his best!

What we've seen from Mario so far is a sad story about a striker who came to a team that doesn't play to his strength, a team that does not want to change even a bit for the striker it has and it feels like Mario isn't liking the situation very much. Sure he's an important figure in football, sure he's achieved a lot in his career so far but he's not bigger than our club and he better accept that quickly. Far too many players in history have tried to be something different to what the Liverpool philosophy is and failed (for a recent example see the case Cole, Joe).

I have respect for Mario and what he potentially brings to any club as a player and a person. I genuinely believe he can be a success at Liverpool. But not if he fucking does not push his ego back for a few weeks and comes to the matches with a healthier attitude. What he presented yesterday is nowhere near good enough (mainly judging his apparent mental approach here) and if he doesn't want to improve on that I'll be very disappointed and upset because I genuinely like the guy.

And yet people aren't all over Fer's back because he was a workhorse all game and did a great job for them despite wasting the opportunities he did. 

Balotelli on the other hand didn't. He was there to maybe provide the final touch if both own goals hadn't gone in, but most of the time he made an appearance in the game it was to put an ambitious shot wide instead of perhaps passing to a player in a better position. On MOTD Shearer was having a go at QPR for switching off and not looking at the ball for the quick free-kick for our first goal, but if you watch Balotelli he wasn't paying attention either. 

I think it's unfair that he's shouldering all the attention and basically being a scapegoat for what was collectively an awful display yesterday, but he's certainly not helping his own cause with the petulant and selfish way he's playing. Bad split-second decisions in the game and poor positioning aren't as easy to blame as a player who really just doesn't seem to have his head in the right place right now in terms of how he's working on the pitch.",0,1413805166,null,0,1413805369,0,cleiigi,t3_2jrmht,t1_cleiigi,t1_clehgf7,null,1426441060,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

You know, so we wouldn't again find ourselves doing something stupid like spending a record fee on Andy Carroll and then playing without orthodox wingers so he hardly ever had a cross to attack in his whole time at the club.

Admittedly it was initially a bit confusing what this 'philosophy' was going to be as possession-is-everything was quickly thrown out of the window and the lightning counter-attack became our key weapon.

Even so, after a season of thrilling success based on the pace of our forward play, it was immediately clear that Balotelli, Lambert and Borini were not the players Rodgers needed to build on last year's model. And we're back to where we were a few years ago, with strikers who don't fit the game plan.

So do we have a 'philosophy' and commitment to buying the players that 'fit the profile' or not?

To change our play to fit the players we have would be an admission that no, we don't have a 'Liverpool style' or a way of playing: we're just another club that it trying to do the best we can with the players we've got. And that's why Rodgers won't do it, because our only chance of competing with clubs like Chelsea and Man City is to focus on one thing and do it so well we are unplayable.

With all respect to Lambert, Balotelli and Borini who seem like ace lads one and all, our strikers are completely unsuited to the way we played last season and we're left in a position where we can either try to hang on until the transfer window, or have Rodgers tear up all the development from the past 18 months and start again from scratch.",0,1413805341,null,0,false,0,cleijvn,t3_2jrvkl,t1_cleijvn,t3_2jrvkl,null,1426441040,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

Then again, we can't forget about the glaring misses that he has had. Furthermore, and most importantly, Pelle and Aguero are very fitting for the teams they play in. Pelle is an upgrade over Lambert and Aguero is the best striker in the league. On the other hand, Balotelli's currently lumbering form deeply contrasts the gameplan that was established last year. Either the team changes, or he changes. Hopefully both.

I am firmly behind Balotelli, to me what these shots show is that it isn't necessarily that he isn't afraid to go for goal like Lambert, but more reminiscent of the shot monster that was Suarez all the way back in the first season. Suarez was similarly frustrating to Balotelli now. You can clearly see his attacking intelligence, he can see the runs and performs them but that simply doesn't occur often enough. His hold up play is absolutely immense. This to me is overlooked, but he has an absolutely remarkable touch when under pressure, not dissimilar to a certain Uruguayan. 

I personally don't put too much meaning in the QPR match, as you could clearly see his frustration at both the low quality of service he got and the lack of support he had when he was finally on the ball. Countless times Balotelli received the ball just inside QPR's half to be faced with their CB and at least 2 others. Not ideal circumstances.

Yeah, it would to an extent. In the event of an exit, a significant number of banks and law firms would not move to Brussels or another EU capital, but significantly increase their offices there. Businesses want to have full access to the EU market - it's one of the biggest in the world. Us excluding ourselves from it isn't going to do anything but reduce the flow of capital through London. 

&gt; We already don't have any global influence outside of being the State's sidekick and no one cares what the leadership of a pokey little island says.

You'd be surprised. In the EU and the UN, Britain is taken fairly seriously. In the Council of Europe, the UK is seen as one of the most competent and influential States. We certainly are not tied to US foreign policy - look at differing attitudes to Palestine as a visible example. At a more nuanced level, the ways in which the UK and USA go about interpreting international law are extremely different, with the UK approach often being much more internationally influential. We have the top two universities in Europe and the brains to match it. We have a respected and powerful foreign and commonwealth office filled with incredibly influential diplomats. 

Our power on the world stage has obviously declined, but we certainly aren't just America's whipping boy, and we certainly aren't remotely insignificant. Still the sixth largest economy in the world, with the international political influence to match.

Then again, that's as open to Fry's lurid point-awarding discretion as decimal places (as the number of non-decimal digits would effectively be transferred to all other scores).

These aren't really compatible. Twitter is an open forum where anyone can easily communicate with everyone else and is specifically used by trolls who aim to get a reaction. Threatening someone on twitter doesn't show the same intent as finding out your address and writing a letter to you. 

&gt;The probability of them carrying it out isn't relevant to whether or not it's a crime. It's a crime if the person intends for the victim to fear it will be carried out.

If the police had to react to every inconsequential threat online it would cost millions and clog up the judicial system. The police should be differentiating between genuine threats that have a likelihood of actually doing someone harm and a troll online who's sole aim is get a rise out their target.

The Tories have actually increased spending, further escalating the precarious nature of our Economy. 

The truth is much more boring. You can't change much in just a few years. It's dangerous to make sudden cuts to current spending, as so much is committed and accounted for. You can impose limits on future spending projections which is what has happened. 

The Coalition- not Tories - were elected and instantly calmed the bond markets by giving clear forward guidance of the route ahead.

Andrew Balls, brother of the village idiot Ed, is a senior exec at Pimco the worlds largest bond trader. Prior to the election he warned on the UKs perilous economy, while his boss commented that the UK economy was lying on a bed of nitroglycerin.

The reason why the coalition were able to calm markets but essentially continue policy, and for Labour to later come out and say they'd do the same as the coalition - is really simple. The coalition are not Labour.

The Labour front bench is a who's who of world leading degenerate, delinquent reprobates. The coalition are FAR from perfect - NOT BY A MILLION MILES.

Net migration into this country has been over 200,000 people every year since 2001 except in 2011. 

Some of them will be criminals. Some of them will be jobless or taking up menial work. Some of them will be highly beneficial members of society. All of them will have required homes or housing (which will unavoidably reduce the available homes and housing to the existing population). 

Point being with figures that large it doesn't seem logical to sweep everything under the carpet and say 'they're an easy target'. They will have had an impact. 

I find myself against the wrong kind of immigration. We've seen big financial cuts across the nation - people put out of work - rising house prices and so on. It's rare that we've had *good* news on those fronts. 

Therefore we're not in a position to throw open the gates to everyone and say 'come on in, there's plenty to go around'. 

Make no mistake, that doesn't mean that all immigrants are bad or a detriment to this country...

...but realistically our resources are finite. They don't go on forever. We can't house the whole planet on our little island. If we can't house the whole planet then how many *can* we house before we're stretched too thin?

What's the argument here? That people who send death threats online should be allowed to since it would cost too much too police? Surely the police cost is irrelevant to any argument, either you think it's a genuine cause for the police or not - cost is utterly irrelevant. This isn't a debate about effective policing.

&gt;Because they're not genuine death threats, that's the point. No ones life is in danger. The only people who take this stuff seriously are the professional victims or those who don't understand the internet.

Someones life doesn't have to be in danger for it to be harmful. What a sweeping statement to say that there are no genuine and informed people who have suffered as a result of death threat that is unlikely to lead to their death.

As for the other parts - I think you are being too harsh. You can see that he is trying and he is frustrated with himself that he isn't doing well. Players cope differently to frustration - Suarez ran even more than before, but he is one player in thousand. And how long has he been here now? Not nearly enough for him to take on all the instructions to copy Sturridge's role. He's not Sturridge. He was played as a centre forward in Euro 2012 and he performed well, but elsewhere  he has played on wing or off the striker. Latter being his favoured position. 

The opposition defence have it very easy - he's the only target for them. Liverpool's midfielders don't offer nearly enough support that they should. Henderson played deeper role in the first half and didn't make many forward runs. Lallana was rather quiet and ineffective. Remember when we played Suarez alone against Chelsea @ home. He was marked out of the game. The same happened in the FA cup final against Chelsea. He was alone in the first half and the game changed when Carroll came on and Suarez dropped a bit deeper. Carroll took on most of the pressure and Suarez had much more freedom to play. I think we have the same problem at the moment. Balotelli has never been very enthusiastic player.

It's hard to take a threat seriously from a 5"" nothing matchstick man for example. You can size people up offline and decide whether your safety is at risk. You can't really do that online most of the time and with ""social media"" taking such an important role in peoples lives these days what's said online tends to leak into IRL most of the time.

There is an argument for simply not using the internet if you can't take lesser threats and/or insults. I've said it before and I'll say it again - I wouldn't walk into a sex shop if I was allergic to plastic or offended by big ol' rubber cocks, and people shouldn't use the internet if you can't take being called a cunt now and again, but there is a line that needs to be drawn when the safety of someone is questioned, whether it's towards some no-mark Z list celeb or Bob/Shirley from down the road.

I ended up going Computer Science. Don't regret it at all. 

The honest fact is that there is huge competition for games programming jobs, and taking a degree of speciality like that will close alot of doors into other types of programming. With so much competition, you need to be the best. Good course and a first, even then they may take you as a free intern and dump you because they can. You are playing a big gamble to get into the industry.

I realised in the middle of my course that I didn't like the style of programming, and didn't really have the head for engine programming. I'm now a web developer. I would have been screwed if I took the games course.

I would say its best to go with Computer Science, and research which universities can offer sandwich years at possibly games companies. Also try to see if they offer modules that are good for that, and write your dissertation involving 3D programming in some way.

Don't get me wrong Computer Science degrees are great, they will expose you to a wide array of topics that you may not have otherwise thought about, however the lack of specialisation will mean that you needing to focus heavily on doing a lot of things outside of the course in order to have greater set of usable skills that game companies look for e.g. graphic programming (like using shaders on the the GPU instead of doing everything off the CPU), game based AI (very different from classical AI techniques), the basic game development process etc.

Doing a Games courses doesn't mean you will become too focused and unable to adapt to other areas, as at their core any GOOD games course is basically a Computer Science degrees which focus on game programming/ development.

Also there are a lot of game related courses at Abertay (Computer Game Technology, Computer Game Design, Game Design &amp; Production Management and Computer Game Applications Development), because of which some of the courses do provide better job prospects than others.

Because it shows the intent to actually carry out the threat is incredibly low. Blurting out some bullshit on twitter for the whole world to see isn't the level of threat the police should actually put resources into in contrast to something like someone throwing a brick through your window late at night with a death treat attached which is. 

&gt;What's the argument here? That people who send death threats online should be allowed to since it would cost too much too police?

The argument is about whether the police should be wasting their time on empty threats. If they look into a threat and feel it could have some real world consequences then fine, do something about it but 99.9% of the time that won't be the case. Do you want a police force acting proportionally and intelligently or one that just pisses away public money by acting like mindless automatons?

 &gt;Someones life doesn't have to be in danger for it to be harmful.

The point is you can disconnect from somewhere like twitter. If you're someone who gets incredibly emotional about trolls online you don't have to subject yourself to it. Most people are able to get over their fragility and become a better person for it, if you're not one of them disengage yourself.

Our extra contributions buy us 0 extra representation, the EU gives us back no where near what we spend and distributes it to countries like Lithuania which we have practically no interest in trading with. 


The separate issue of how much economic activity which occurs between us and the EU is completely orthogonal to that, if we left the EU we would not be locked out of those markets and only estimates can be made of the effect of any potential tarriffs - if the EU can even continue to exist without the UK.

**I can't assess the level of real risk ** .. and so would have to assume it's a serious threat. 

Also consider that there is a subculture of people who will see such threats bandied about and take them seriously as calls to action. This happens.

See but this is exactly what people further up are talking about - temporary problems that can be fixed through the EU. I'm not saying that if these problems were fixed we should help create a federal Europe - that would be a difficult constitutional decision but it certainly doesn't mean we should abandon the preliminary project for the sake of problems we could fix very easily. The EU doesn't depend on a democratic deficit but is weaker for it. Any pro-European wants the deficit to be dealt with as much as UKIP if not more so arguing that we should leave because of that is like arguing that we should end the entire concept of the NHS because of an MRSA outbreak in one hospital. Fundamental problems with the concept are a reason to leave but very few of the issues UKIP raise are anything but temporary easily solvable problems. 

&gt; is that what you want for this country?

If it improved the well-being or standard of living of people in this country and decreased ethnic tensions across our continent then yes. I have a feeling UKIP would oppose federalism even if it improved people's lives because they feel so strongly about adhering to traditional government. If you think 'this country is better than that' would you argue that it was wrong for US states to be 'subsumed' or German states? It seems to have worked out quite well for both of them. 

Of course suggesting that federalist pro-EU people would be happy with a US style solution is not terribly fair. Europe is too diverse to do that. Instead an entirely new system would need to be developed as an evolution of the current one with a constitution which set in stone the individuality and freedom of action of member states while giving them a forum to develop common policies where it's beneficial to do so and a sense of cross-continental solidarity. Ironically a federal constitution would solve many of  UKIPs worries because it would end EU expansionism into non-treaty issues and would give member states a simple way to sue EU institutions for doing so. We wouldn't loose national identity just like Texas never lost its association with cowboys and Bavaria never lost its traditional lederhosen; in fact the more lose version of federalism we would have to invent would require much greater cultural sensitivity and protection because of the diversity already present. Thankfully the EU already funds the preservation of uncommon languages, sports and traditions etc including those in the UK. Scottish and Irish Gaelic are official EU languages. Protection of British traditions and culture would be cemented in a federal constitution achieving a lot of what traditionalists want ironically. 

&gt;i think we can do better.

I don't. Were going to have to come to a realisation - with China and India rising both with economies many times the size of ours, Russia on the offensive in Eastern Europe and Africa increasingly acting together to combat terrorism we are leaving a period of stable US hegemony and entering a world with multiple continent sized superpowers with huge spheres of influence. We can enter this new era on our own under the wing of the US like the cold war or as a leading player in the biggest economic bloc by GDP the world has ever known. I think we are likely to do better taking the latter option. ",0,1413813149,null,0,1413813465,0,clekuo2,t3_2jrl34,t1_clekuo2,t1_clehyor,null,1426439967,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

&gt;The idea is to create a gigantic free-trade zone between the EU and the US, or a TTIP – a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership

You say this as if 'Free Trade' is a good thing... look at the piss poor quality of US Patents, this would hit UK Patents square in the nuts, then the GMO and the trading of chemical laden 'meat' surely would not be detrimental to the UK...

&gt;There is absolutely nothing not to like about the TTIP

This is a double negative... Nothing not to like.. so basically nothing to like about it

&gt;virtually the only commentary we have been offered is absurdly hostile and misinformed

When negotiations are taking place behind closed doors, that will result in US Corporations having more power of EU/UK citizens than it's own govt....

&gt;I do not wish in any way to inflame these numskulls

So calling the people Num*B*skulls is not inflaming them....

&gt;They are talking rubbish. Almost every single objection to the current proposals is based on pure superstition

Oh so Americans being one of the Most Obese nation on the planet is 'superstition'? 

&gt;If we get the TTIP agreed, it will certainly not mean the privatisation of the NHS, and nor will it mean a green light for fracking Sussex

[Oh really?](http://stopttip.net/investor-state-dispute-settlement-isds/)

&gt;At the very most it will mean that there is some protection against government deciding – locally, at state level, or nationally – to legislate in some arbitrary and unexpected way so as to discriminate against foreign companies. That strikes me as a very useful thing for British companies, both large and small. 

Fuck off Boris, it means that the Govt can STOP companies doing things that cause danger and injury to the public, instead the TTIP will allow them to sue when the Govt imposes [plain packaging on cigarettes](http://www.ag.gov.au/tobaccoplainpackaging) or bannign the use of dangerous Pesticides, or implementing new Health Legislation that moves away for 'Private' health care

&gt;America is the home to more affluent households – with disposable income of more than $300,000

&gt;Threatening someone on twitter doesn't show the same intent as finding out your address and writing a letter to you.

I use my real identity on Twitter so if someone started threatening me I would take it seriously.

If it was one nasty comment that would obviously be very different to lots of comments but it would be very disturbing because I would prefer not to be raped or murdered, ya know? If I received a single mysterious bouquet of flowers that would be very strange, but quite different to getting them *every day*.

&gt; Twitter is an open forum where anyone can easily communicate with everyone else and is specifically used by trolls who aim to get a reaction. 

Anyone could walk up to me in the street and make a threat, do you think that's ok? And if I get upset it's just because I'm a ""professional victim""? What if they follow me home? Am I permitted to be upset then?

 What is wrong with you? There are certain things in life you seem to be unaware of, like the reality that lots of people actually do get raped and murdered. It happens. Maybe not after threats online specifically, but often after harassment and threats made to a person.

Well that's a question though isn't it.

It's immature to take what people say online seriously. People with genuine intent to do you harm are very unlikely to openly express it to everyone via twitter. 

&gt;*I can't assess the level of real risk * .. and so would have to assume it's a serious threat.

You can go a long way to assessing the threat based on the medium it's sent to you. If you receive your death openly on twitter you can be about 100% sure nothing will happen. How many millions of death threats do you think they've been on twitter and what percentage of them have lead to an actual real life threat on someone? Probably such a tiny amount it's statistically virtually non-existent. 

I'll say though there is a difference between throwaway threats online and those that do show some kind of intent and that is where the police should use intelligence and discretion after investigating, not just making blanket arrests. If someone for example is showing they know your name, address, phone number etc and how they plan to kill you that should be treated differently to some troll saying ""I'm gonna fucking kill you lol"".",0,1413814102,null,0,false,0,clel7y2,t3_2jrqv8,t1_clel7y2,t1_clektw1,null,1426439796,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

false,Real_Rodriguez,null,null,"We have to give some credit to opposition defences here, they're containing him very well, we use him as a target man and that makes him a very important player in build up, but he's always hustled with and without the ball, they force him into either dropping deeper or moving out wide which basically negates his contribution in any move. He frustrates easily, that's not going to change overnight but with the lack of rewards from persisting with his role we can hardly blame him for not making progress there.

Even last season while Suarez was still out Sturridge suffered a similar fate. He was harried and not really given space, and we really struggled, the difference was of course that Sturridge was a very direct player and he'd take his chances a lot better. Once Suarez came back everything changed, not only did we have another legitimate set-peice threat back but we had another direct player who worked really well with Danno, together they'd push defences back as a duo.

Mario takes a lot of fouls (and tries for so many more) but defenders aren't necessarily afraid to hit him, he's not really making it too hard for them and more often than not his back is to the goal when the challenge comes.

SAS had that great inter-play working for them, on their own they did have their work cut out for them but in tandem they were something else, defenders had to be careful with their challenges because if the over-committed and missed they'd be left for dead and there'd be a huge gap to exploit.

Mario just can't seem to work in that target man role and I really think he ought to be shifted out to the left flank to give him both the space he needs and let him cut in with his stronger foot. I feel like BR wants him in that CF role and kept running with it until Danno's return despite its lack of function to give Mario the time to bed in and learn what runs he can make with our providers but it's been a horrible move for us.

Also yes, sadly. I was never a massive fan of Matt Smith, but some of his Amy/Rory episodes were really great. Even something like The Lodger was a really good departure, and I can't stand James Corden 95% of the time.

Since the introduction of Clara and the production's need to make her the central character, I think the show has suffered a great deal.

You don't need any extra information to appreciate those stories. Be warned, the pacing of the Main Range is very similar to the Classic Who pacing of 4ish 25 minute ""episodes"", but if you start with the standalone Eighth Doctor Adventures they are more like the New series, with each episode being about 50 minutes. Also, there are no cheesy special effects to deal with, so the stories ""look"" a lot better in your head than classic episodes do.


I would recommend starting with the EDAs, because McGann truly is phenomenal (and so is Lucie Miller!), and the pacing will be a much easier transition for you. Once you get through those 4 seasons and the 2 Dark Eyes boxsets, go back and give the Main Range a try. The Eighth Doctor and Charlie have really good chemistry as well, although it took me a while to warm up to her.

As far as the Big Finish ""ranges"" you've pretty much got it figured out. There's the Main Range, and then a number of other ""spin-off"" ranges, that are still Doctor Who stories, but sometimes follow a different format (like the Companion Chronicles being told exclusively by the companion). I would mainly stick with the Main Range and the EDAs until you decide how you feel about Big Finish, and then start branching out from there.

There is absolutely nothing stopping us from working with the US right now. We went to Iraq despite loud objections from our EU partners. The EU did not alter our ability to work with the US and our work with the US did not impact our position within the EU. Indeed this was the period in which the UK had enjoyed our greatest influence on the continent despite our US ties.

The US aren't angry at EU countries in a vacuum. It is a primary US strategic objective to get the EU operating as an equal partner in a world that is increasingly not dominated by people who think as we do. The fact the EU hasn't responded with enthusiasm is not a reason for the US to shut up shop and go isolationist. Indeed the US is just pushing ever harder for this because it sees the EU as a critical partner. If anything the US is mostly angry at us because we are the primary barrier to greater EU military co-operation. It is a touch muted because at the same time we have brought France on board in a way it hasn't been since 1939 (France also want the exact same thing the US want BTW).

The interesting thing in this entanglement is France might alter its position of ""Entente above nothing but EU if possible"" if we are no longer in the EU. If we exit the EU our strategic position relative to France changes dramatically. We could even lose the Entente if the US and France decide that with Britain out of the way they can go ahead with full EU military integration.

There is a possibility of a tripartite US, EU and Britain alliance but guess which one of these does not look like the others?

You've accused Stephan Fry, a mentally ill 57 year old man, of pimping mental illness to sell a book, when he is not the one who wrote the article, or presented it. He doesn't write, present or editorialize any of the articles about him. He has written many best selling books that talk about all aspects of life. His first two books cover periods of his life before he was even diagnosed, and barely feature Hugh Laurie, let alone mental illness. He is asked questions by a journalist, and then they write, editorialize and present everything in the manner that they deem interesting to their readers. 

The result is something you deem to be a ""constant talk"" and ""pimping"" of mental illness, when the vast majority of his books, TV shows, and documentaries works that he is responsible for writing and presenting feature none of these. The exception are his most recent book, and his documentary on BPD which are a tiny fraction of his total creative output.

(1). Pochettino is still trying to find a “partner” for Capoue at the base of his defensive scheme.  Mason has come in for the last two games and has offered something different (more on this later).

(2). The manager is being ridiculously fair in his approach to finding that partner – I don’t think it is a coincidence that Bentaleb, Dembele and Mason have all played around 250 minutes each – I would bet a fair amount that he has a program for them all.

(3) Lots of people continue to spout the Sherwood nonsense that all the tools at the disposal of the manager are much of a muchness.  Or worse still, of similar quality. It is quite clear that they are all very different:

Mason offers the most offensively in terms of running at and shooting at goal (5).  He is also very good positionally and makes more interceptions (7), at the detriment of tackles (although the mugging of Fernando was a beauty).

Bentaleb is a good all rounder – his best talents are his eye for a pass (3 KPs so far this season) – his key passes and assists look very good for a 19 year old. But has a few weaknesses that need to be highlighted, he doesn’t head the ball nearly enough for someone in his position (1 aerial challenge), or dribble (0!!) and his shooting is anaemic (2).

Dembele is an enigma.  Rarely loses the ball (90% pass comp), always plays the ball forward (117) and can carry the ball with ease (13 take ons).  He’s a tackling monster (13!!!). But on the downside, no KPs or Assts and his shooting is just as anaemic as Bentaleb.

Main point, one of these players could emerge as the perfect foil for Capoue’s from the base quarterback-ing. We’ve yet to see Stambouli and that leads me neatly on to…

(4) I know saying the word “Paulinho” around certain Spurs fans is like swearing but I can’t help but think that all roads lead to him. He’s only played 30 mins in the PL this season so there is not much data to compare against. But his 2013/14 numbers: 72 Shots / 6 goals / 2 Assists / 19 Key passes / 768 fwd passes / 32 interceptions (from 30 games / 2374 minutes) while not “elite” they look Ryan Mason-esque but on steroids.",0,1413815043,null,0,false,0,clellx2,t3_2jpi4m,t1_clellx2,t3_2jpi4m,null,1426439615,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

The police should be acting based on what is a genuine threat not on subjective feelings. One person on twitter can be more emotionally harmed by an insult about their weight than another person getting a death threat. 

&gt;Nonsense figure that you just made up, of course.

Give me a percentage of the millions of twitter death threats you think have actually been attempted in real life.

&gt;I'm not talking about what the police should do, I'm talking about what should be legal and illegal, there's a big difference in that.

The police are meant to act based on what's legal and illegal. 

&gt;So are you accepting that it can still be harmful or not?

As I said people are making a active choice to be engage in the twittersphere, if you feel you're being emotionally harmed the onus is on you to get the fuck out not sanitise everyone else because you can't handle it. You're trying to bring real world ideals to somewhere they don't apply.

There was a similar incident later in the game where he _did_ go to ground looking for a foul and ended up missing out on a second chance at a shot on goal.

This also applies to goalkeepers in the dual of a penalty.

And as far as I'm concerned I agree, and I like it when our keepers are bright orange-ish. A big orange blokes has more of a physical presence than a grey one. The contrast side, non patterned bit should be orangey red imo.

Although I think there was a similar study done about red accenting (think our old red collars) and found that this had a negligible effect.

Also, on a more scientific tangent. I think we assume that the organism covered in red or human blood is more dangerous and scary than anything else. There's probably absolutely no evidence to back this and I imagine some smart researchers have actually discovered a reason for red to be so dominant. 

Anyway, the Asian countries seem to understand this psychology from some sociological perspective. Red is deemed lucky in lots of countries, particularly China. It goes some way to explaining Tan's decision.

false,rubygeek,null,null,"&gt; Immigration is about cultural loss in the UK.

The current makeup of the British population is a heavily mixed population based on waves of immigrants that pushed out the earliest populations almost entirely. The English language being a perfect example - it's a West Germanic language, originating with the Angles and Saxon immigrants, full of influences from Old Norse, followed by Norman French, and later again by more modern French, again followed by the importation of loan-words from all over the British Empire.

Current British culture is the *result* of wave after wave of immigration.

What you consider ""cultural loss"" is simply *change*. Change that has happened largely because it has been *willingly embraced* by the population at large.

How do you celebrate christmas, for example? Do you have a christmas tree? Do you see it as part of British culture?

Well, that is a German imported tradition, first popularised in the UK by nobility and particularly by Queen Victoria, in the 1840's onwards.

And how would Britain look without the curry?

But why does character development = soap? I just find her completely bland and the focus on her has been to the detriment of pretty much every other aspect of the show: the plot; the villains; even the Doctor - Capaldi has had no room to prove himself.

Chris Eccleston only had one season but he made a real impact on the series and I was sad to see him go so soon. If Capaldi was to regenerate in the S8 finale, I'd have no strong feelings either way. It's not his fault as he's been given no service by the scripts, but I feel like most of that is because of the focus on Clara.

&gt; Rory and Amy had 2 and a half seasons together and specials to really evolve as characters and as a couple compared to the time Danny and Clara have had.

I agree, they haven't had as much time - but then I think it was a mistake to cram their entire love life into one series. If they knew Jenna was leaving, which they must have done if the series continues in the direction it's heading, they shouldn't have bothered with Danny's character at all. It feels rushed.

&gt; clara and danny are mostly if not entirely separate from the episodes and situations.

And this is partly the reason the episodes and situations suffer so much. They have to make room for Danny and Clara's relationship, so you end up with terrible narratives and villains as with The Caretaker.

&gt; You are being far too critical and subjective here with your comments and if you are the writer of this article. Judge the episode on it's own merit and season, not on the past, especially with the huge hurdles and differences between them.

It is possible to judge something on its own merit and with reference to the past. And with a show like Doctor Who, it's inevitable that those comparisons will occur - and why not? The show's format has changed with each Doctor (less so from Eccleston to Tennant, but it was still finding its feet there), and so it's difficult to avoid comparisons to what's come before.

Even judging Series 8 on its own merits, it falls flat. Flatline was a highlight, but even then, it won't be one I return to with the regularity of past season highlights.",0,1413819437,null,0,false,0,clenm88,t3_2js05j,t1_clenm88,t1_clemzbv,null,1426438678,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

I have enough to cover the mortgage if I go boots up, but in the event I get one of the 300+ illnesses or conditions listed (even if it still lets me work), I can also use it as a kind of salary to get me through it.

Look into it. But if you're paying a lot for Life cover (it should only come to a few quid a month), you're either paying too much, or you have critical illness in there somewhere.

Then it also depends on the number of conditions listed in your policy.

Pretty much every City based business already have substantial presence elsewhere in the EU anyway, and would not hesitate to shift more business out of London for customers that wants their business in the EU.

Personally, if Britain leaves the EU, the only reason I'll stay is because of my son.  It's not the financial situation that worries me, particularly - my skills are in high enough demand - by that if the UK leaves it is because of the influence of political groupings that see persona liberty and workers rights as dirty words.

The fact is that is how the odds are not worked out on your personality traits. This isn't Marie Claire. It's actual figures. If the actual figures show one group is at a lower risk than another. Then they deserve to pay less, regardless of whether it's a gender or a club the belong to or have taken a pass plus program. Because obviously completing a program doesn't mean I'm actually a less reckless driver. Unless you want to then argue that gender obviously makes no difference to anything.

IMO it's actually sexist not refuse allowing Women to pay less if they actually are at a lower risk on the odds.

OK, let's look at this:

Income: £1380

Mortgage required: £115000

Repayment Mortgage 25y@5%: £670

Service charge: £350

Monthly cost of flat: £1020

Remaining money to spend on council tax, all other bills &amp; living expenses: £350 

And that's assuming that your salary is exactly £20k, which isn't right.

&gt; the two spare rooms would meet if not exceed the monthly mortgage repayments in rent

*Assuming that you keep them both filled*

&gt; However, I earn less than 20000 currently, and would therefore essentially be looking at a mortgage over five times my salary, which I don't think I'll find

There is an extremely good reason why they'd be wary of lending you the money.

false,OftenItalic,null,null,"Cahill is a better defender than Luiz was overall. I don't think Luiz is going to be missed, especially since I think a new central defender will be brought in in January. He certainly wasn't worth close to the amount he sold for to the team and it was great business, a better defender can be gotten for less.

However I don't think any CB is going to solve the issue. Ivanovic is the weakest link in the defensive chain. His contributions in attack are often admirable but not enough to make up for the fact that so many of the goals conceded are a direct result of him not playing his position properly. Azpilicueta should be the first choice right-back. He's competent in attack but more importantly he's a much stronger defender than Ivanovic is and would help clean up a lot of the issues happening in the position right now. If Ivanovic is going to play I honestly think it should either be at CB where he isn't free to move forward as much (although this has its own issues since he isn't as consistent as the alternatives) or as a defensive midfielder which is a position he hasn't played before to my knowledge but actually would fit quite well with the way he is currently playing.

If this happened I think your impressions of Cahill would change. He's struggling to deal with attacks because of factors outside of his control. Ivanovic is absent and he hasn't been playing with Courtois for long enough to have a full understanding. The team's style is a new one and he has the rawest deal to adapt to. At his core though he's a pretty consistent and adaptive player, he displaced Luiz for a reason and he was outstanding last season as well as being arguably England's best player at the World Cup (though that doesn't take much, he certainly did better than any other defender).",0,1413820625,null,0,false,0,cleo7nb,t3_2jm4fc,t1_cleo7nb,t1_clekbus,null,1426438400,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

&gt; It's the delusional Cameron I take it?
I say delusional because, who cuts the British Forces and then tries to join every foreign war going?
Who promises a referendum so the public can have a say then, in the same breath informs us that he will fight to stay in the EU?
Who keeps announcing that the National Debt that Labour ran up with their profligate spending and borrowing, is reducing, but in fact is actually more now than it was when he came to power?
Yesterday on the Marr show I saw Barroso refute everything Cameron promised.
I was a Conservative member and voter for eons, then came the Liberal left in the form of the Eton closed shop brigade, now I urge you to vote UKIP before Brussels kills us.

So you think a gay couple kissing is doing this? That still doesn't make sense because that means you're coming from the perspective that this gay couple kissed purely out of ""Hey everyone, we're gay"" rather than, you know, kissing because they're a couple.  

If I took your perspective and flipped it around to hetereosexuality, wouldn't you find it ridiculous if I commented ""As a gay man, I am sick to death of seeing straight couples kissing and holding hands, because they're parading and flaunting their hetereosexuality around as though they think they're better than me""?  

The point is, is that gay couples shouldn't give a shit if there are judgemental people out there and should feel safe and secure enough to kiss. People like you are terrible because your mentality is part of the problem.

&gt;By far the majority of perpetrators were described as 'Asian' by victims, yet throughout the entire period, councillors did not engage directly with the Pakistani-heritage community to discuss how best they could jointly address the issue.

Or would you like to see The Times investigation?

&gt;In September 2012, a series of investigations by The Times based on confidential police and social services documents, stated that the abuse had been much more widespread than acknowledged.[19][20] It said that there was systematic abuse of white girls by some Asian men (mostly of Pakistani origin)[21] in Rotherham for which people were not being prosecuted.[22][23]

Our best shot against Madrid is relying on the counter. For this, I reckon we need Gerrard in the CDM position, quickly and accurately distributing the ball to fast-paced advance players. Gerrard as CAM is flawed (I think) for two reasons: *a)* lack of mobility (neither Gerrard nor Balotelli are pace merchants) and *b)* we would have to shift the responsibility for distribution onto either Can or Lucas, neither of whom I fully trust in that role. 

Hard-working, fast-paced players at the top are a must, so a Gerrard (CDM), Henderson (CM) and Allen midfield (CM) with Balotelli, Sterling and Coutinho in the front three 'hive' makes most sense to me. 

Of course, Rodgers can also try to be more conservative and limit Madrid's midfield options with a CDM duo of Gerrard and Lucas, but we all know how well that usually works out...

I think the only reason people are still so sensitive is because it's so rare and gay couples never make themselves visible in public because they're nervous or don't want to be stared at, I think it's a catch 22 situation and if more people did it, less people would stare; it's because it's still so invisible and uncommon it's perpetuating the unusualness 

I also try to be visible because I think people usually assume I'm not gay because of how I look or walk or whatever, so when they see me with a guy it breaks stereotypes and prejudice as well which is good 

I wish there wasn't still so much fear and it was more common because people are perpetuating sensitivity and invisibility for their own personal comfort. If everyone was visible in some way or another people wouldn't think it was so unusual, because it's not unusual. I think if more people saw gay couples kissing every now and then as apposed to literally never they would stop being so sensitive to it.

And FFS there is nothing unrealistic about expecting a defeat. We were very far from convincing in defeating the bottom team in the league. In fact, we really should have lost that game but were insanely lucky. Where we finished last season means next to nothing. The players on the field right now cannot recreate last season's play or form, because we are a different team since last season, with a very very large void up top and in our attacking DNA. If we don't ourselves call to mind last season's form, why should RM remember it and tremble? 

RM struggled against an extremely well organized and tight Ludogrets defense. Our defense is the furthest thing from tight and well organized.

This operation was actually distributed over a number of European jurisdictions exploiting a specific weakness in each. In the UK that is the ease upon which anybody (resident or not) can form a limited company and use the prestige of such a company overseas to perpetrate fraud. In fact you can go and form a company now online in 15 mins and put Ronald McDonald as the director, there are literally zero checks in place.

In this case they used nominee directors, some poor person who is paid pittance just to put their signature on various documents. The bank accounts were then opened in Latvia where the banking due-diligence is inferior to most other EU states. This is where the real weakness is in my view. You need a bank account to launder money, I don't know of any UK based banks that would provide such account facilities for a company without meeting 
the directors and shareholders in person.

A limited company is not much use on it's own. Although there is a new bill working it's way through parliament now that seeks to ramp up the checks on individuals forming UK Limited Companies. It remains to be seen what exactly this will entail but it's likely to make the company formation process much more bureaucratic. The bottom line is you cannot 100% verify the identity of a foreign individual. So I'm not sure requesting scans of people's passports and proof of address will be sufficient to deter individuals with the presence of mind to commit this type of fraud.

Some ground rules:

- You will not be hired immediately. You just won't. There are lots of people already here struggling to find jobs.

- You will not be hired at all, unless you have skills/experience. If you do, tell us what it is/they are and we might be able to give you more specific advice.

- Housing in Bristol is not cheap.

- Jobs in Bristol are not scarce, but they're **highly** competitive.

- You will not make any money instantly - Even if you find a job, you will not be paid until a month afterwards.

- You will not be able to rent a place, as landlords will not accept someone unemployed/without income.

- You are unlikely to be able to claim state benefits, as you have little to no contribution towards National Insurance. At least not immediately.

- You will definitely need a UK bank account. Strict taxation laws in the UK mean that employers take declarations very seriously and most companies will have an inhouse finance/payroll department. ""Cash in hand"" jobs are scarce. And even if you get one, you'll need to declare your own taxes, which is not easy.

However, if you're in it for the long-term, you can think of the upcoming correction or whatever you want to call it, a prime time to pick up bargain basement deals whilst short-term investors head for the hills.

You see, long-term investors will likely stay-in, knowing that eventually things will pick-up, plus they'll be delighted to bag some bargains along the way by continuing to invest in the interim.

Trying to time the market however, is probably the worst thing you can do, as you'll always time it wrong. If you buy when everyone says it's great, you've probably already missed the boat because the bargains have been had and the prices have gone up.

&gt;As of September 2014, no member state has withdrawn from the EU. However Greenland, as a territory, did so when gaining home rule from a member state (Denmark). The Lisbon Treaty made the first provision of a member state to leave. The procedure for a state to leave is outlined in TEU Article 50 which also makes clear that ""Any Member State may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements"". Although it calls for a negotiated withdrawal between the seceding state and the rest of the EU, if no agreement is reached two years after the seceding state announced its intention to leave, it would cease to be subject to the treaties anyway (thus ensuring a right to unilateral withdrawal).[37]",0,1413824775,null,0,false,0,cleqcfr,t3_2jrl34,t1_cleqcfr,t1_clei4h2,null,1426437333,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

I have no citations that suggest that LGBT people make up experiences of discrimination. I believe it is probably so low that it is negligible. Contrary to discrimination research, such research is very hard to find. I'd say it's probably non-existent. Can you link me to your sources?

I certainly don't have a study comparing the frequencies of the two. But parsimoniously speaking, we know that anti-LGBT discrimination is a phenomenon that occurs fairly frequently. We have no reason to believe that fake LGBT discrimination happens at any sort of high frequency.

And before you try to claim that the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, let me ask you this. How many horses exist? And how many unicorns? Should the lack of research counting the number of unicorns dictate that we should assume we don't know if there are more unicorns than horses?

The examples of general contempt for the UK goes on and on and on...  
  
&gt;* Assurances made by the United States to the United Kingdom that 'extraordinary rendition' flights had never landed on British territory were later shown to be false when official US records proved that such flights had landed at Diego Garcia repeatedly.[234] The revelation was an embarrassment for former British foreign secretary David Miliband, who was obliged to apologise to Parliament, describing the incidents as 'a most serious matter'.  
    
&gt;* In the 1991 Gulf War, nine British soldiers of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers were killed when a USAF A-10 Thunderbolt II attacked a group of two Warrior IFVs. Public controversy arose after US military authorities refused to allow USAF pilots to give evidence at a 1992 British inquest into the deaths, saying that they had already supplied all the relevant information.[221] The inquest jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing. The families of those killed accused the United States of 'double standards' after three US military officers were reprimanded for negligence after a separate incident involving the similar death of a US soldier.  
  
&gt;* In 2003 the United States pressed the United Kingdom to agree to an extradition treaty which, proponents claimed, allowed for equal extradition requirements between the two countries.[240][241] Critics argued that the United Kingdom was obligated to make a strong prima facie case to US courts before extradition would be granted,[242][243] and that, by contrast, extradition from the United Kingdom to the United States was a matter of administrative decision alone, without prima facie evidence.  
  The United States also refused to accede to another priority of the Blair government, the treaty setting-up the International Criminal Court.  
  
&gt;* The United States has been accused of pursuing an aggressive trade policy, using or ignoring WTO rules; the aspects of this causing most difficulty to the United Kingdom have been a successful challenge to the protection of small family banana farmers in the West Indies from large US corporations such as the American Financial Group,[250] and high tariffs on British steel products.[251] In 2002, Blair denounced Bush's imposition of tariffs on steel as 'unacceptable, unjustified and wrong',  
  
&gt;* The ongoing refusal of the US embassy in Grosvenor Square to pay the London congestion charge has also been a minor source of controversy. Embassy officials claimed they did not have to pay the congestion charge because it was a tax, from which diplomats were exempt. London officials asserted that the congestion charge was no different from the toll charges paid by drivers to travel into US cities such as New York City via bridges and roads. US embassies paid similar congestion charges in Singapore and Oslo.

I'm sure any European who reads serious journalistic comments on US foreign policy in US publications gets tired of seeing the US manipulation of European policy and its nexus of relationships in Europe referred to as it's 'European strategy' as if the organisation of 500 million people's lives are just pieces on a ""Risk"" board. European policy is allowed to succeed or fail according to its effect on US interests. The author is right, though, that we would do the same. If you appoint yourself as the controller of the entire world it is sometimes necessary to forcefully marshal some allies so you don't look as aggressive to the world or your own people.

[Bird and Fortune hit the nail on the head](http://youtu.be/nohGiQmOxlc) - it would have been very embarrassing if the US had been the only nation to lose men in the Iraq War - too reminiscent of Vietnam so better to drag the UK into the war so their servicemen die and you can hide behind the fact that it's an international operation. 

And that's just foreign policy - drug laws, copyright laws and mass surveillance are all direct imports from the US that are widely discredited and disliked by the public but enthusiastically embarrassed by politicians who are pleased to bend to the requests of US politicians. In other words US politicians can indirectly overrule the public because they have the ear of the cabinet. It's makes infinitely more sense to participate in a European project which can protect our interests without looking at everything in 'strategic' divide-and-rule terms.

---

&gt;

&gt;The __party ring__ is a British [biscuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biscuit) first made by [Fox's Biscuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox%27s_Biscuits) in 1983. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] It is a circular biscuit with a central finger-sized hole. On top of this is a layer of hard coloured [icing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icing_(food\)) with ""wiggly"" lines in a different colour. The five colour combinations are:

&gt;


&gt;* Orange icing with white lines

&gt;* Pink icing with white lines

&gt;* Pink icing with yellow lines

&gt;* Purple icing with yellow lines

&gt;* Yellow icing with pink lines

&gt;Party rings were a product of the 1980s fashion for the newly developed chemical [food dye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_dye) system that enabled more lavish colours to be incorporated into the manufacture of biscuits. This made them a very popular choice for children's parties.

&gt;The crisp, hard sheen on the icing is because of the use of [carob bean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carob_bean) [gum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carob_gum) — the carob, or locust bean, is also sometimes used as a [chocolate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate) substitute.

&gt;A standard pack of party rings consists of a long plastic tray containing five biscuit wells, each holding four biscuits of the same pattern, making twenty biscuits per pack.

Also, there is no reason you couldn't simply copy EU regulations on your own.  Isn't this what Norway does?

Also, since you are not in the Eurozone, and have control over monetary policy and bank oversite, I think you would be much less effected than say Spain leaving.

The U.S. Congress turned to ""freedom fries"" in its own cafeteria and some elected officials urged boycotts of French goods.

France have Remy and Giroud. Giroud has only just started to play well for Arsenal and is injured now anyway, Remy hasn't ever been a top option for France because he hasn't played for a top team since Lyon and that is back when Benzema was playing well anyway.

'Strikers' better than Benzema; Suarez, Lewandowski, Aguero, Higuain, Ibrahimovic, Tevez, Cavani, Falcao, Rooney, Van Persie, Diego Costa, Remy, Sturridge, Immobile, Muller(when he plays there), Jackson Martinez, Negredo, Jovetic, Dzeko, Mandzukic, Berbatov, Ramos and Bony.

If the team's attacking ideas were built around Suarez and he admits that, he needs some different ideas when Balotelli is playing up top by himself.

I think one thing that would be helpful is playing Sterling as a second striker.  Look at the winning goal from yesterday and where Sterling is when Coutinho plays that ball.  He's right alongside Balotelli as a 2nd striker, and he's got the legs to make central defenders life a living hell.  It's a hell of a pass from Coutinho as well, but it never happens without a player of Sterlings pace being that close to other teams center backs. Also, as good as Sterling is on the defensive side of the ball I hate to see him expelling that much energy tracking back the whole game.

""Holy shit I would love to tie up CelebX and have my way with her"" 

I'm not directly addressing her with this threat. She could very very easily take that as a threat against her person (if she manually searches for her name or her followers are outraged and make her aware of it) and claim ""He broadcasted his method of how he wants to rape me to potentially millions of people"", even though a) I might not have intended it as a threat b) I didn't @mention her so could legitimately claim I was directing my message at my followers, not her and c) I didn't even intend for it to be ""rape"" but consensual roleplay. 

How can a 50 year old judge/policeman know the nuances and the difference and who's camp will he sit in? My guess it the celebs, because the celeb has more power, more followers, can mobilise an army or support group. The celeb is also rich and has an 'image to protect', the defendant is probably some 24 year old guy with no mates and nothing to lose and a bad solicitor.

UK law is heavily based on precedent. It'll only take a few sensitive judges to site with these celebs (it's already happened btw, didn't that Tom Daley troll get arrested for hurting his feelings?) and then future cases will automatically site with the victim. 

edit: Should this crime be subjected to 4 months in jail?

Find people to share hobbies with. For me that's Magic the gathering. The wife could get in on that too. Find a hobby shop nearby, check your library, Google clubs in your area, make friends and take interest in their hobbies.

Netflix is a huge time dump so watch out. Start woodworking (very time consuming with satisfying finished products), martial arts (historically accurate longswords, fencing, whatever suits your fancy), perhaps painting?

They simply front and back him everywhere he goes and he has struggled.

When he plays as part of a 3 with Hendo and Gerrard that's when you see the magic of the Newcastle game. Coutinho is at his best with the whole defense in front of him, which usually means receiving the ball at the midfield line and not in more traditional ""10"" areas. This gives him space to plan his magical runs or spot one of those keymaster passes. And the greatest thing about Coutinho is you just have to tell the other guys ""when you see him get the ball and look up, just start running."" In the Newcastle game Borini Hendo and Studge would just starting sprinting in a direction and Coutinho would more often than not find the right guy.

They're not customers.  Tesco has customers.  A hospital clinic is not a business.  Treating patients the same way you would customers of a business is at the heart of many problems faced by the NHS in 2014, such as increased demand on various services which cannot be met by existing provision.

Patients should expect good, timely care from competent and caring staff.  Clinics always run late because of giant demand caused by waiting time directives, increasing complexity of cases and numbers of multimorbid patients, and more junior staff (and non-medical staff like nurses and physicians' assistants) doing clinics.  It's probably not the receptionist's fault that the clinic is running late, and it's highly unlikely that them having a cup of tea or a coke is slowing things down.  In fact, rigidly adhering to breaks taken at a remote staff room would probably cause more disruption.

I think a more appropriate thing for the trust to do would be to politely reply to complainers saying that the staff are busy and that clinics often go over time, and that they are sorry and are trying to improve.  And make a tea/coffee machine available for patients as they wait!

Looks like he's got overconfident and a reprimand would be in order.

A.K.A you have something that we want. Usually money, or oil which is basically money anyway.

That's what is so wrong with the US political system. Corporations ~~bribe~~ lobby politicians so they get into office to vote on policies or laws that make the corporations even more cash.

Money is at the centre of everything in America: universities exist for the reason of making a profit, a hospital will charge you $45,000 to deliver your wife's baby, and they have huge monopolies where it comes to basics like internet access. Also, I hope you enjoy commercial breaks with your Olympic opening ceremony.

Here in the UK, we're getting dangerously close to adopting the same model. It's already happened to universities.

Luckily, we don't allow lobbying in British politics yet, ~~[or allow religion to be a part of it](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27145915)~~.",0,1413831472,null,0,false,0,cletwyc,t3_2jscwb,t1_cletwyc,t1_cleppij,null,1426435596,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Cycling - I'm by no means an athlete, but after a tiring day a nice gentle cycle by the beach is amazingly calming.

So what to do when a number of immigrants are also criminals? Shut down everything? No. But is it not prudent to review procedures letting people in and keeping a tighter initial reign over these people? 

The premise here is that they are coming here to benefit - be it through jobs or crime or whatever other reason. Immigrants move to where they move because there is some benefit for them. 

Therefore - as a nation - we should expect certain levels of responsibility and appreciation from them.

Libya was not really an issue of significant disagreement and even then the US official stance didn't undermine our interests and vice versa.

When it is not in our interests to support the US we will not, but that doesn't mean that when it is in our interests to support the US we shouldn't do so with gusto.

First off - if you've a titter of wit, you'll be grand for a call centre interview. :) So I'm posting this more for general ref.

Interview specific:

- Make sure you'll be able to confidently talk about what you know about the company
- Prep for questions about 'a time you worked well as a member of a team' or 'a time you showed leadership' or 'a time you dealt with a problem customer' etc [edit, given sales emphasis of this employer, 'a time you outperformed your sales target/best example of up-selling or cross-selling' etc.]. What was the situation, what did you do, what was the outcome, and what did you learn from it? (The 'what did you learn' bit means you can take a more positive angle on something that didn't go so well - 'If I were in a similar situation again, I'd do this instead'.) 'Behavioural Descriptive Interviewing' uses questions like these and give higher scores to answers that show the applicant used the skill in question more recently, and used it more often. So when picking your examples, bear that in mind - and if you've loads of examples, say so, and say 'this is probably the best example I can talk about'.
- Film yourself doing a mock interview (alone if need be! tho' if you can get a mate/family member to help, all the better - maybe harder not to laugh tho'...), answering questions, so you can see your body language and notice any vocal tics you have. If it's going to be a phone interview, or if you don't have video on your phone/a vidcam, record audio
- Focus on the questions, not how nervous you're feeling - if you notice you're feeling nervous, just bring your attention back to the question
- Remember that you're there to convince them why they want you, not why you want the job (even tho' the question's usually asked in terms of why you want it!). Put yourself in their shoes and think why about what they need from you as an employee
- E.g., they're going to be giving you training in the skills you need, so they'll be more interested in attitude - are you going to be confident with customers? Be able to keep your cool? Be proactive? Fit well into the team? I worked with one guy in IT who was great technically, but a 'mare attitude-wise. He worked quickly but was the cause of a lot of waste of time trying to manage him - he actually quit and then re-applied for a job and didn't get re-hired. If an employer thinks a candidate's going to be neurotic, prickly, and potentially causing or being surrounded by work dramas, they'll be loathe to hire them - this is why you should never bitch about past employers etc in an interview. I used to interview candidates in that IT job and would be amazed at the negativity and defensiveness some people display in interviews - almost like it's a therapy session! Punctuality's a biggie for call centres 'cos there are financial penalties for employees not being logged on to the system and ready to take calls as the shift begins)
- They will no doubt ask how you'd deal with an angry customer; key things are active listening (making encouraging sounds whilst customer is talking, acknowledging that they are upset, check to see that you've understood their issues and reassure them that you are going to take action) and keeping your cool. You don't have to take abuse of course, and they'll train you in their specific policies/scripts, but those are the general points (and active listening is key). I did a brief stint in a call centre once and one of the guys who was training me lost the plot with some poor woman on the phone; she'd been rightly annoyed about the issue but his ego did not like the complaint - was hectic!
- As mentioned below; speak confidently and clearly! Imagine you're talking to a friend of your parents you've just been introduced to, or something - i.e. being respectful but not too formal or stiff. Take it just seriously enough and no more
- Having read posts below about them being a sales outfit rather than support - know (i.e. google) sales techniques! Active listening for unspoken needs, up selling, cross-selling, anticipating barriers to purchase and being able to counter them with accurate info, benefits v features - loads of stuff online on effective sales techniques. 
- **Forgot two key ones; been a long few days** Review the job description/application form again before the interview - highlight any key words and use those in your answers. The people scoring the applicants might well be cross-referencing to either document, and you 'mirroring' back the words used in them makes it easy for them to score you positively. And...
- Keep open body language, make eye contact, and smile. But not too much of the latter two. :) It's a positive opportunity to talk about your strengths, not an inquisition (unless you're going for one of those 'cut-throat', Wall Street type interviews or your interviewers a sadist). Enjoy the thing!

Anyway, OP, I'm sure you'll be grand! And saw you're just looking for a stop-gap en route to a Master's - sweet. Just started a Master's after graduating in '99 and 7 years of self-employment; shock to the system but class! Best of luck to you.

Furthermore, rather than simply blaming foreigners for crime if that is the case, perhaps we should ask ourselves why they are more prone to committing crime in the first place then? Is it because, at least in the case of children born to foreigner parents, they aren't receiving a proper education? Is it because they cannot find work? Crime, regardless of who is committing it, does not simply happen for no reason or solely because they are foreigners.

Though it's weird we don't handle them like the [ponc seeimhithe vs. postfixed-h](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_%28diacritic%29#Overdot). Now that unicode is here maybe we should use both marks or neither, it's not like we're somehow economising by reusing other nearby languages' movable type (which will typically have acute accents, but not our consonant diacritic) anymore or something, if we ever were.

Maybe we should double up the vowel as an alternative to the siineadh fada, [vowel duplication was likely an alternative to the latin ""apex"" mark in ancient times, and the siineadh fada likely descends from the latin apex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apex_%28diacritic%29).  I do now suspect some irish spelling standardisers a long time ago were well aware of this and thus arranged for doubled vowels to be not really otherwise used in irish orthography, so that, much like the widely used `ḃ ↔ bh, ċ ↔ ch,` etc. we could, if we wanted, do  `á ↔ aa, é ↔ ee,` etc.

You do also see somewhat similar doubled-vowel-means-long-vowel [usage in romaji systems for japanese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSL_romanization).

60 grand is the top 20% of household incomes in the UK, even in London it's more than enough money to live a comfortable life. Unless OP only associates with exceptionally unlucky people then it's more likely most of his friends are like my friends: buy a coffee from Starbucks and a lunch at Pret every day (35 quid a week, over 1500 quid a year), refuse to live beyond Zone 2 (when the same in Zone 4 might get a bigger flat, or even a bit beyond that getting a 2 bedroom with a garden), go out to the pub all the time (dropping 50 quid every Friday night), go to gigs and don't hesitate at dropping 100 quid on shoes. It's a great life, but unfortunately you have to make lifestyle choices and cut back to have kids or buy a flat.

**Price of product:** £3.39 for 25 wipes

**Where did you purchase:** Exclusive to Boots. Great during the 3-for-2 offer

**Product claims:** These convenient cleansing and toning wipes contain antibacterial Tea Tree and skin calming Witch Hazel to help keep your skin clear and healthy by:

* deep cleansing your skin of dirt, oil and make-up without over-drying
* fighting spot-causing bacteria and helping to unblock pores
* toning your skin and tightening your pores.

**About you:** Dry acne-prone skin. I use these to take off oil from OCM or as a morning cleansing before sunscreen and makeup. These pads can get dry if use them every other day, so I have a small bottle of witch hazel that I use to 'top up' the wipe's moisture before use.

**Your opinion:** I've used about 5 packages (125 wipes). I like it a lot. My face is a little tight after usage but I always put on moisturiser right after. I will continue to buy these as they are the kindest wipes I've used thus far. This product can remove makeup in a breeze.

**Ingredients:** ""Water, cetearyl isononanoate, glycerin, ceteareth-20, glyceryl stearate, Cetearyl alcohol, Ceteareth-12, witch hazel extract, tea tree leaf oil, propylene glycol, Polysorbate 20, parfum, citric acid, sodium citrate, disodium EDTA, phenoxyethanol, benzoic acid, methylparaben, propylparaben, 2-Broo-2-nitropropane-1, 3-diol""

**Product claims:** Your skin is completely cleansed, toned and hydrated, leaving your skin feeling soft and soothed all day long.

Daily Essentials Gentle Facial Cleansing Wipes enriched with natural Almond Oil &amp; Hydra IQ: 
Gently cleanse, removing make-up and waterproof mascara leaving skin feeling hydrated. 
The formula with Almond Oil is mild and caring and is suitable for dry and sensitive skin. 

**About you:** Dry acne-prone skin. I used these as a morning cleansing before sunscreen and makeup. These pads can get dry if use them every other day, so I have a small bottle of witch hazel that I use to 'top up' the wipe's moisture before use.

**Your opinion:** Fuck this product. I've used 2-3 packages (50-75 wipes). I bought four packs because they were on offer. I disliked the product so much that I threw away an entire unopened pack. I had a huge uptick in nodule-style acne. I wasn't sure if it was something environmental or the wipes so I used another pack. One day my face was particularly lousy and I decided not to stick with them. I threw them all out and went back to my old wipes.

The two boys gave the bully a sort of viking funeral, destroying the evidence. That night, Death came to the Doctor and offered to make him her champion, but the Doctor told her, 'no,' and suggested she take the Master as a champion instead. She did so, basically throwing all the Doctor's shame and guilt for the killing and throwing it onto the Master, shaping him into the monster he grew up to be. Much later, the Doctor made a deal with Death, offering her an undisclosed prize to Death in exchange for allowing the Master to finally have peace. Death cheats in the deal, of course, and the Master goes on to be his regular evil self, and the Doctor finds himself owing a debt to Death. How this death is repaid is never elucidated, but it may be that she's come along to claim The Doctor as her champion, since The Master is currently out of the picture."")

The term ""digestive"" is derived from the belief that they had [antacid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antacid) [properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_property) due to the use of [sodium bicarbonate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_bicarbonate) when they were first developed.  Historically, some producers used [diastatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastatic_power) [malt extract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malt) to ""digest"" some of the [starch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starch) that existed in [flour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flour) prior to [baking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baking).

false,Co_meatmeow_bro,null,null,"Lived in China for a few years, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hong Kong and traveled to many other cities there.

* Never met anyone openly racist or anyone hateful at all towards me, racism is different there, it's not as hate driven, it's mostly exclusion driven, ""you're not Chinese"", it's a complex viewpoint of nationalism/culture and identity. Most people there admire westerners as more worldly/intelligent/capable even if they aren't whatsoever. Some others view them as sort of entertainers, because the main position of westerners in their society is in movies, the same way we generalise Chinese in a position of basically kung-fu and Chinese take-away in our society. But it's a cultural identity that you are barred from if you aren't Chinese, and that cultural identity connects with how people treat you.

* Spitting in the street is only by the migrant workers from the countryside, similar to rednecks. I've never seen the average educated city citizen/office worker type ever spit in the street.

* Seen plenty of movies in China, slightly more interruptions than the west, but hardly any difference, maybe one or two incidents where some guy answered his phone. I think its a lot to do with how its normal to talk very loudly on a phone in China, you sort of have to speak loudly to convey tones properly, and there is generally less respect to people outside your guanxi (your network of relationships). It's improving though, it's definitely way more orderly compared with in 2005, as it was this year when I went.

* Lack of care of the environment isn't really a fair viewpoint, the country is trying to catch up to become ""first world"" as it were, it requires a crazy amount of development in a short time, that is undoubtedly going to have both massive positive and negative effects on the country. I mean look at places in the west in our industrial revolution, smog ridden hellholes mostly, way worse. The general populace is fairly educated on the environment, but obviously there's room for improvement. On a side note many streets are ridiculously and religiously cleaned, just because there's always a person to take such a job.

* Cheating at university, I'm not certain about, I've never taught in China, or experienced university there to know first hand.

* They are fairly nationalistic, but the Toyota thing, was more to do with the tension between China and Japan that has existed since WW2, especially because of such horrors as the Nanjing Massacre, which Japan refuses to apologize for( it would be sort of similar to if the German government completely refused to admit the Holocaust ever happened, what do you think the rest of the world would think about them). Because of this, Chinese people generally hold a grudge against the Japanese government, and a small percentage against Japanese people as a whole. But basically Japanese celebrities, products and culture are very well received in China, countless sushi restaurants and most of the cars are Japanese or Korea, electronics etc etc.

* Considering most of Asia theirs isn't true, what they consider is China as a specific historic land, basically at a point in history where it had expanded the most, and from that all that land is forever Chinese to them, because they still essentially see themselves as the Ancient Chinese civilization, I mean Italians don't really see themselves as the Roman civilization still, if you understand it this way, they've kept their cultural identity intact for all these millennia, and because of China's isolation/general weak influence in the world in the past thousand years specifically, they lost various territories and basically want it back.

* Their culture in my opinion isn't poisonous. Greed, hate and ignorance are poisonous, and that is in every corner of the world. It's a symptom of the human condition to fill the hole everyone feels inside, to feed ego and consume without regard to others, to be self-centered and succeed on the suffering of others either with or without the knowledge of it.

Long reply, but I thought I'd try to balance out what I see as flawed opinions if you really have listened to those friends. People exaggerate and are often biased.
