For Lovren it depends on his value, and what he would bring to the team. BR clearly wants leadership at the back and thinks lovren offers it; however, he wasn't exactly dominant at the WC. And he had a history of making mistakes in France I believe. I think it's premature to nail him on as one of the best defenders in the league honestly, he has the potential to be for sure, but I think he is error prone. I also have trouble paying more than sakho for him.

It is the adoption that is the hard part - the initial costs of training, reorganisation and the first five years are costly as they are with virtually any IT project.  However once you take those into account, you end up with a far more frequently updated, likely partially bespoke system which is both far more stable and far cheaper to run than any comparable Windows front end with comparable if not superior user friendliness.

United had a tour when they walked the league the year before. Madrid had a tour when they won the CL last season. Big clubs always tour and they always play a mix of lesser opposition and other touring clubs. 

Are you honestly going to cherry pick a season and blame it on something that happens every year? 

Regarding United, I can maybe think of something more significant that happened last season that could explain their struggles. 

I mean ffs before 2011/2012 we toured in fucking South Africa against garbage sides and we were basically the Harlem Globetrotters for 3/4 that year. 

I fully understand what you're saying and I vehemently disagree with it. The quality of opposition matters very little in preseason, as evidenced by what most successful clubs are doing. It is just as good to play against weaker teams who are at peak fitness than European sides who are just back from holiday.

true,Chapatrap,cnty-uk,United Kingdom (and sometimes Ireland),"&gt;Sweden relies on other countries to bale it out with its defence needs. Denmark, which spends only 0.2 percentage points more of its GDP on defence than Sweden, had to respond to a Russian incursion into Swedish air space because the Swedish one was on Easter Vacation. Denmark, a member of NATO, also happens to be one of the happiest and richest countries in the world. As is Norway, which is even more militaristic than either Sweden or Denmark.

Even so, Denmark spent 4.4 billion on the military in 2012. The UK spent 61 billion in 2012. Why do we need to spend this much? If we're spending any money on the military, it should be for defending mainland Britain (perhaps the various leftover islands we've got across the globe too). It should be for winning wars but not starting them. 61 billion or 56 billion, that's still a lot of money that could be better used somewhere else.

&gt;It's a matter of perspective whether our military is bloated. A lot of people think that its been cut rather too far. The army hasn't been this small since the Crimean War, for example. The Royal Navy has one of the lowest numbers of surface ships in its entire history, though they're significantly more capable than ever. 

I'm still going to argue it's not enough. During the 1800's, we had Pax Britannica, when we were the superpower of the world. To have such a small military at the time was probably due to the 'peace' at the time because we were the superpower of the world. These days, we are not a superpower and even if the military was small during Crimea (when we were a superpower), it needs to be smaller. Most of Europe is past the point of fighting land wars, especially western Europe. The military should be smaller but big enough to defend Britain.

I'll get back to that point in a minute but first a little background on bonfire traditions.

Bonfires were first lit to illuminate the loughs on the east coast of Ulster to allow Williamite forces to dock safely, does you're average loyalist in Belfast know this, your guess is as good as mine. Over the years a bit of competition has built up over which band or society can build the biggest bonfire, in working class areas some of these bands have heavy influence from paramilitaries which doesn't help matters and seldom any Orange influence, especially in Belfast (When a band accompanying an Orange parade to a church service was invited inside by the preacher the reply was, ""we're Loyalists not Protestants."" ). Many districts have opted to have environmentally friendly beacons (made of willow) and have a more family friendly carnival atmosphere than what would be present at some of the controversial bonfires the media focus on.

Presumably burning tricolours on bonfires started sometime after the Easter rising. It could have been as a symbol of defiance against the creation of a home rule parliament in Dublin, or the extension of such a parliament to Ulster. 

When the free state was created the constitution had a couple of points that would be worrying to Unionists and Protestants, it placed the Roman Catholic Church on a pedestal, and it made a territorial claim to the 6 counties of Northern Ireland, burning the flag may have been a protest against either of these points. Both of these points have now been resolved although the territorial claim was only removed as late as 1998.

There is also the slight issue of the Republic of Ireland's support of the IRA's border genocide campaign by naming an army barracks after notable mass murderer Frank Aiken.

However if you were to ask why many loyalists burn tricolour I'd doubt if they point to any of those reasons. Perhaps if any pointing to a symbol of opposition to extension of the republic's borders, however if you ask them if they vote, and use all their transfers the answer could very well be no.

In Newry, on of the most Republican dominated councils (there is not enough unionists to achieve a minority veto): where there are many victims of Republican terror, and where Frank Aiken instigated the Altnaveigh massacre, the council named a children's play park after a terrorist: the bonfire, organised by the local band, does not burn tires or tricolours, there is a small concert and a beacon made of willow is burned, dispite being in the council where unionism is most under threat.

There is no bonfire in my district of Bessbrook, and Armagh county generally have a fun day on the 11th.

If you are burning the flag for any of the reasons I've stated I see very little problem with it, if you don't know why or your excuse is 'themmuns' then its not an action I'd support.",0,1404495766,null,0,false,0,ciojcid,t3_29tcjt,t1_ciojcid,t1_ciog9ob,null,1434550798,-9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-9

true,unbrokenreality,eng-Bristol,Bristol,"not necessarily - you can get a less severe sentence under S2 than you can under S1, but that doesn't mean to say you will.  The guidelines linked go in to more detail about it, but essentially under S2 guielines there are three categories of offender, which are:


Category 1 - where the extreme nature of one or more category 2 factors or the extreme impact caused by a combination of category 2 factors may elevate to category 1 

Category 2 - where there is:
* Severe psychological or physical harm 
* Penetration using large or dangerous object(s) 
* Additional degradation/humiliation 
* Abduction
* Prolonged detention/sustained incident
* Violence or threats of violence (beyond that which is inherent in the offence)
* Forced/uninvited entry into victim’s home 
* Victim is particularly vulnerable due to personal circumstances

Category 3 - where factor(s) in categories 1 and 2 not present

There are then 2 levels of culpability, which are:

Category A - where there is one or more of the following:
* Significant degree of planning
* Offender acts together with others to commit the offence
* Use of alcohol/drugs on victim to facilitate the offence
* Abuse of trust
* Previous violence against victim 
* Offence committed in course of burglary
* Recording of the offence
* Commercial exploitation and/or motivation 
* Offence racially or religiously aggravated
* Offence motivated by, or demonstrating, hostility to the victim based on his or her sexual orientation (or presumed sexual orientation) or transgender identity (or presumed transgender identity)
* Offence motivated by, or demonstrating, hostility to the victim based on his or her disability (or presumed disability)

Category B - where factor(s) in category A not present

If the offence is Category 3B, the starting point is 2 years and this can be reduced to a high level community order depending on mitigating circumstances. 

So yes - while you can get a lessor sentence, you're not going to get that unless there's a very specific set of circumstances. ",0,1404496392,null,0,false,0,ciojlmf,t3_29qae9,t1_ciojlmf,t1_cio9j6v,null,1434550960,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Though often hailed as one, I really don't think that's an unqualified mark on the plus side.

Even our own HoC Defence Committee said ['all the evidence suggests that plans to initiate the air campaign hastened the disaster'](http://www.european-security.com/n_index.php?id=2732), and other evidence suggests our government was aware that the bombing would likely lead to an escalation of such atrocities.

And to say Yorke was never a star in the Messi tier is maybe correct, but he was still their first choice striker the year they won the treble, so I think it's hard to claim he wasn't pretty good - he just never had a particularly glamorous playing style. And Van Nistelrooy was Dutch player of the year before he moved to United (again, for a lot of money for the time), and that was back before the Dutch league turned fairly shit too.

&gt; Exactly my point when I said that the vast majority of 'big name' players are already at clubs like Madrid, Barca, United and clubs owned by billionaires.

And exactly my point (and OP's point I guess) that do we not want to be a club in the same tier as Madrid, Barca and United (until last season)? How do we break into that tier and actually win trophies and try and win them consistently without signing those sorts of big-name players? If your point is that nobody buys the best players except for the very top clubs, do we not want to be one of those very top clubs? I'd agree right now maybe we can't, but you say ""that's just how player recruitment works"" like every club goes for buying the next-big-thing rather than current-big thing, when actually the ones that win things are the ones that tend not to.

I think at the moment our squad depth is a bigger problem then our lack of first XI quality, and I wouldn't be happy with us spending big on a few individuals, but at the same time I don't think it's the best long-term policy for us to consistently be passing up players like Mata and Fabregas and letting our rivals be picking them up instead. Sometimes we want to be the club signing Suarez for £60m+, not the one unable to keep him.

I'm simply replying to your overly personal attacks. Technically this was more of a courtesy than anything as it's the reason your post was being downvoted. That's why I contested your idea of Bosingwa being good. I fear that you're serious. Expressing a thoughtless opinion is usually reserved for trolls. Expressing an opinion is great but you really do have to defend it to hold any weight. Simply your unwillingness to validate yourself makes you come off like a twat. I concede points where they hold water but you're unwilling to engage in a discussion without turning it into a war of words to the point where this is becoming political satire.

Although an entertaining political satire it is. Presumably an American political situation though. I suppose that'd make you republican. (Although I suppose from your point of view this probably now comes off as the Pot calling the Kettle black.)

Flags, arches, murals, everywhere. It's such an eyesore. Now, I know that you think these kinds of displays are great, but I don't, definitely not to this extent. It's so over the top. It makes me feel to some extent a hostage in my own home, but country-wide. 

We all have to share the place. I think our landscape is one of our best features, I think it's a real shame that both sides have taken to these excessive displays of tribalism. Yeah, I get it, you've both got a terrible history together and don't have much respect for each other, so you identify with your families and neighbours and church friends who were all raised in the same culture. 

So the culture is real and it's OK to identify with it, but as usual, the third culture; i.e everyone who is indigenous but doesn't identify with the nationalist or unionist sides, immigrants who come from other cultures etc - is ignored and constantly subjected to a landscape, culture and reality of openly sectarian paramilitary flags/murals/marches/riots on a fairly cyclical basis. That's not on, and that's why I got annoyed at your arch. Because it just sums all that up. 

I know that's not how *you* intend it (or is it, even a little bit?) but some do intend their displays to be aggressive, intimidatory and crass - it's those communities' responsibilities to rein that in, no? No, because as we see, politics here is governed by relative extremists, especially on the Unionist side (and in increasing degrees of absurdity, recently,) so no change is coming soon!

So to me, your expression of culture is kind of a middle-finger, along with all the other middle-fingers given in every flag, mural and march. I guess you have the right to offend people, but you're all over the bloody country, everywhere you look. As I said, it's such an eyesore. Why can't people like yourself have a bit of consideration for other people in the country?

It's really pretty upsetting, to be honest. I know a lot of people who feel kind of under seige - a lot of people.

I'm not denying there are people in our ranks that do not adhere to our ideals and do these things for the wrong reasons.

QUB's flag expert Dr Dominic Bryan has done a lot of work on flags and what they mean, and found that flags symbolise and mean different things to different people, and it incredibly varied what people think of different flags represent and mean. And there are plenty of reasons to burn a flag and some of them reasons are reasons that you should be offended by, but that does not mean all of them are.

For example if you burn an effigy of the Pope, or a monarch, because you are morally, philosophically or religiously opposed to what they represent, whether it be the historical actions of the church of Rome, or the idea of power resting with an unelected official, then that is fine. If you are burning an effigy of the Pope, or the Queen, because you literally want to set that individual on fire because of who they are that's not okay. The two actions look exactly the same but its difficult to see which without further investigation.

You could easily write Quintin Tarantino off as a racist because of his use of the word, 'Nigger' but if you actually look at the context its clear that its not the case.

I can't think of many cases where someone was retroactively prosecuted under a law that had been abolished since the alleged offence.  But certainly those convinced under those laws aren't automatically pardoned.

&gt; What if you commit a crime and its punishable by death, then the death penalty is revoked?

The death penalty (as a sentance) was still available, in theory, for a long time after the practice had been ended.  It just wasn't carried out.

I think the threat of jail time may make them think twice before engaging in illegal activities just to get a story. Besides, if someone knows that at most they will have to resign there is nothing stopping them from arranging a nice golden handshake for if/when they are caught.

Also it will cost us bugger all in the grand scheme of things.

&gt;The __Martini-Henry__ was a [breech-loading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breech-loading) [single-shot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-shot) lever-actuated [rifle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle) adopted by the [British Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army), combining the dropping-block action first developed by Henry O. Peabody (in his [Peabody rifle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peabody_action)) and improved by the Swiss designer Friedrich von Martini, whose work in bringing the cocking and striker mechanism all within the receiver greatly improved the operation of the rifle, which new iteration was combined with the polygonal barrel rifling designed by Scotsman [Alexander Henry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Henry_(gunsmith\)). It first entered service in 1871, eventually replacing the [Snider-Enfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snider-Enfield), a muzzle-loader conversion to the cartridge system. Martini-Henry variants were used throughout the [British Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire) for 30 years. Though the Snider was the first breechloader firing a metallic cartridge in regular British service, the Martini was designed from the outset as a breechloader and was both faster firing and had a longer range.

He's had 9 appearances all of last season, so he's not exactly been playing, first of all.  Reina has also had the highest number of mistakes that have led directly to an opposition goal; because he closes down and sometimes gets it wrong.

Mignolet is match fit, familiar with the squad, and is an excellent shot stopper.  He's made mistakes this season, but no where near as many as Reina has for us previously, and despite these mistakes we still came second in the PL.  WE BOUGHT MIGS BECAUSE REINA WAS LOSING US GAMES.  How can people forget that?

I'd rather have Migs starting, with Reina on the bench for cup matches and other games.

WE LOANED REINA for a reason.  He wasn't good enough then, and I severely doubt that with an entire 9 games over last season that he has gotten any better now.

Migs is younger, so give him the chance to develop with the squad or buy a better keeper, but we can't go back to a formula that doesn't work.  Yeah, Reinas a legend, and was an absolute beast, but now starting him is a massive risk we don't need to take.

I honestly can't see how anyone can say Reina in here with a straight face... Did you see his performances at Napoli?  Lets just say he continued his form from where he left off...

The problem is that his pace makes him invaluable to us because Lambert insists on playing a long-ball/counter-attacking 4-3-3. He's not an outright winger and neither is Weimann. 

He has decent physical strength too, but beyond that he's very poor. He's dumb as a mule in most situations, his passing is unremarkable and his finishing is atrocious.

Once or twice a season he will have a match where he *destroys* the opposition. The rest of the time he's just a bystander.

I would love to take Gabby out of the team and switch to a 4-3-1-2 formation with Benteke and Weimann up top and a good playmaker behind them. I'd like to see if it works.

&gt;Some 90% of our trade by travels by sea

What country has any reason to attack our shipping, seeing as most of it goes to Europe, America and the Commonwealth?

&gt;Protection of Oil, Gas and other key dependent resources

Which is why we should be working on greener energy. Fossil fuels will be gone near the end of this century. Instead of importing oil and coal, we should start working on quick, efficient ways to generate energy without the need of fossil fuels within Britain.

&gt;The ability to influence international events, both diplomatically and militarily

Oh, yeah, because influencing world events militarily has gone great over the last 300 years, hasn't it? No. If we want to influence internationally, we shouldn't have to resort to threats.

&gt;The US is going to move focus more and more on the Pacific and Asian nations as their economies become more and more important.

America wants to go to Asia? Fuck 'em. We're in the EU. Start concentrating on Europe instead.

true,smaclver,null,null,"Lovren.

To expand a bit, what do we all want in a centre half? I don't know about you guys but for me, the perfect centre half ticks all or almost all of these boxes:

-   Concentration and avoidance of error
-   Positional soundness
-   Aggression
-   Comfort on the ball, passing accuracy
-   Reading of the game
-   Ability 1v1
-   A 'love of defending' for want of a better term, centre halves who shy away from challenges but think they're Franz Beckenbaur so never have to get back in defence can fuck off
-   Physical attributes, speed and strength

For me, Lovren has all of these, and has proven he can do it in the Premier League. He's particularly good in 1v1 battles which is what we need to cut out counter attacks. He also has the self-confidence of Kanye West so is unlikely to freeze and shrink into the shadows when he joins a big club like ours. When we were linked to him last year I had my doubts because he was unproven and had some apparent attitude problems, but none of those have surfaced at Southampton and the fact that we're back in for him now suggest our scouts are happy with him (and they make a big thing of looking for players with the right attitude first and foremost).  Worst comes to the worst we could always get Steve Peters to fix his head if needed (I don't think it will be though).",0,1404503166,null,0,1404504266,0,ciom9si,t3_29ukhy,t1_ciom9si,t3_29ukhy,null,1434552195,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8

East Coast shows how it can be done. That is a successful franchise that is currently a net giver to the treasury. All other train operators, apart from one which I think is South West Trains, receive more in subsidies than they pay back in access fees and other payments. We're subsidising these firms that are making huge profits, while also paying huge amounts for tickets. We even pay for the rolling stock. The contract for the new trains on the East Coast mainline is worth billions.

Then these train companies pass off the investments that the taxpayer has made as its own achievements. Just look at First Great Western's current adverts that make a huge deal out of Network Rail's improvements, not their own.

The whole system of Network Rail fighting with TOCs whenever there is a delay is an absolute farce and wastes time and money.

One argument in favour of privatisation is that train users has gone up. But that's probably also down to an increasing population, housing prices in city centres pushing people into suburbs, more disposable income for leisure travel and higher petrol costs and other road charges that dissuade car use. Privatisation can't be responsible for that increase alone.

Most European countries have state run train services and run them efficiently. Governments of The Netherlands (Abellio Greater Anglia), Germany (Arriva Trains Wales, Chiltern, CrossCountry, T&amp;W Metro etc.) and France (SNCF part own Keolis who part run Southern, Southeastern and Transpennine Express) all run their own networks as well as having a stake in ours. The profit they make from our subsidies and fares can then be used on their own networks which don't charge the same high fares. 

If other modern countries can do it, so can we. We could have a similar system to Italy even. Where a private firm (Italo) can run trains alongside the state owned Trenitalia. We already have something very similar with Grand Central and First Hull Trains. 

They should be nationalised or fully privatised but regulated akin to how water is managed. The franchise system doesn't work. ",0,1404503472,null,0,false,0,ciome1u,t3_29u76w,t1_ciome1u,t3_29u76w,null,1434552255,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

Now I know that stat is misleading because if he hadn't been on the pitch, they would've had someone else who would've won or lost them points, so the 23 is irrelevant in that sense....but in terms of game changers they truly were a one-man team.

They also had a manager whose defensive system didn't suit the defenders at all. Who plays a high line with Kaboul and Dawson? Only a maniac.

Also, they finished with 3 fewer points and 1 place lower down. If we can do that next season without Suarez (finish with 81 points in 3rd place) I'll be over the moon. Guaranteed CL football again. So this whole notion of them 'doing a Spurs' is baffling. Their season this past year was defined by managerial uncertainty and bad tactics....neither of which we look likely to have this year unless something disastrous happens.

true,BraveSirRobin,null,null,"&gt;  we don't use religion as a motivation for war

Perhaps not directly but it's used heavily in our propaganda to justify most of our recent wars. It's no accident that there has been so much Muslim-bashing in the press coinciding with our recent batch of wars.

For what it's worth very few people have religion as their motivation; this lie is a core part of our propaganda. In every single case there is an underlying conflict that's not religiously based. The Shia/Sunni situation in Iraq for example is much like the Normans fighting the Anglo-Saxons, they are different people with different cultures having the same conflicts we had centuries ago yet our media portrays their literal fight for control of territory as being religiously motivated. 

Could you please list the leaders that you believe *do* use religion as their motivation for war? Certainly not Saddam or Gaddafi, both were secular dictators among a sea of far more religiously driven nutters we call our allies. The Taliban weren't waging wars when we took them down and those they did once fight in Afghanistan had the same religious background and cultural beliefs as them (yes, rape victims are still stoned under our new ""stable"" government), portraying the Afghan civil war as ""religiously driven"" was another little fib from the BBC. Iran hates us because we back their enemies and have a thing for installing the most vile dictators upon them. So that leaves the select number of terror groups and militants who are fighting against people we like, many of which we once supported because they were attacking someone we disliked (e.g. ISIS). And only a subset of them are religiously driven. 

&gt; Just because Cameron isn't on the bridge for a photoshoot responding to mayday calls, it doesn't mean it's not a concern. 

I'm not calling for that; the RNLI shouldn't need to be a charity, it should be a state service. Maybe a part of the Navy, how it's done I don't care. Until then claiming that we maintain a Navy for sea rescues is pushing the truth a little too far (imho). 

You speak of a huge amount of tradition, is it not an affront to this that mariners working daily jobs at sea don't have a rescue service that doesn't depend upon [goodwill donations](https://rnli.org/donateorbecomeamember)?

&gt; So you see no need to try and encourage stability within and/or control over resource laden areas? 

That is the complete opposite of what we do. We have a long history of ""divide and rule"", where new countries are formed around borders guaranteed to provide ethnic tension. Iraq is the quintessential example of this, today's battle lines correspond remarkably close to the original Ottoman provinces we carved up. We've invaded them four times over the past 100 years and always due to the inaccessibility of oil, not to ""bring stability"". Between us, America and Russia we've been the greatest cause of ""instability"" in the region and it's because we've all been playing the same Great Game for well over a century.

We do police many sea-lanes and that's a worthy and admirable pursuit but as for the actual waging of war we always do it for our own motives. Your support of the our wars seems to come from a belief that we're a force for good in the world. Far far far from it. 

&gt; You seem unhappy that the world requires us to keep some form of military and that weirdly we use assets to help the country out. 

Given the motives and results of our conflicts I feel that being ""unhappy"" is an understatement. Ever get the feeling you are the bad guy?",0,1404506331,null,0,false,0,cionhtx,t3_29tfar,t1_cionhtx,t1_ciohng6,null,1434552797,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I think I could provide enough evidence on mileage/fuel costs plus actual time spent having to go back and forth / having to live in a van in between shifts cos I can't commute every time. I actually think the main problem will be that my company owns loads of houses in London (note - a massive fucking area) and none of them are anywhere vaguely near my mums. Shifts start at 7am sometimes and no way am I doing a 24 hour shift after battling the tube for 90 mins. Also I have no idea if these houses are challenging behaviour (this is what im trying to stop working with as it's not for me) 

How about - my boss puts me on a 'bank' contract? (Zero hours) I'm technically already on a bank contract for Norfolk, as well as having a part time contract with one service. Maybe I could quit the actual contract and just have zero hours? I wonder how much my employer has to tell the job centre about my contract(s) and types etc. Hmmmm

&gt;What country has any reason to attack our shipping, seeing as most of it goes to Europe, America and the Commonwealth?

Probably not us specifically, but nothing is to stop even the smallest nation from disrupting cargo ships and the worlds trade. Who would stop them?

&gt;America wants to go to Asia? Fuck 'em. We're in the EU. Start concentrating on Europe instead.

I agree more European cooperation is important, however lets not forget the EU has a big stake in the world economy and no real means of protecting it.  The US is looking and becoming energy independent soon, you think they will care about protecting the EU energy sources if they don't have a huge stake in it.

&gt;Foreign interventionism, as the past few years have shown, only inflame the situation and make a lot of people hate us.

No offence but that is a very naive view. You ask the millions of Afghan children who are not allowed to go to school what they think of it, or the people from Kurdistan. The media is very bias, bad news sells well, good news, not so much. I agree we have upset and hurt many people, but we have helped many more.

- Aspas had a fantastic season in La Liga and looked like one of the best strikers in that league. It was little wonder that we bought him because most other top clubs were interested, too. He was unlucky in that he has only had a handful of real opportunities to make an impression because both Suarez and Sturridge were in such fantastic form. 

- Cissokho was, at one point, touted as the best LB in the French league and was quite well respected when we loaned him. We needed cover quickly and he seemed like the perfect replacement; fast, strong and confident on the ball. He, for some reason, did not show his Lyon potential with us at all, but he definitely wasn't a shit player when we first loaned him. 

- Llori just needs time. He's young and he needs more experience. When he's on form, he looks very composed and confident, but it's just that his form has been hit-and-miss so far. 

- Assiadi was so bad that Stoke want him permanently? He might not have fit in our system very well, but at least he might get full time football at another club...so he's not much of a flop.

I get the feeling that that is *exactly* what we mean when we say 'Sanchez isn't a dealbreaker.' It's not a dealbreaker, you just gotta activate the full release clause, or maybe to get creative, start saying the word ""Pedro"". If theres two things we learned from last year, our owners negotiate hard and don't give Arsenal any rope.

I mean, we *do* hold the cards. If literally everything fails, then oh well, we keep Suarez. Boo hoo! Maybe the real worst case is they sell Sanchez to Arsenal and activate Suarez's full release clause, in which case we have a gargantuan pile of money to buy our own attackers with. But they'd surely prefer him to come here and save some money, so that could only happen if Sanchez is really put off of joining LFC for some reason.

A prime example would be the uproar about the three young men killed by palestinians which equivocated  to more sectarian attacks - Israel kills nearly 3 children a day from the Palestinian side but yet the mass media upheavals and subjugates one incident making palestine look like the evil heathens killing people like monsters.

Anyway, Cissokho was just a loan. Signing him didn't break the bank at all and he did get better to be fair to him. Quality left backs are like golddust around world football, otherwise United wouldn't have just paid £34m for an 18 yr old in that position. Left backs are probably the most expensive position apart from striker just simply because of the shortage of decent ones. Bringing in a promising LB on loan last year was a smart move from our POV. It was cost effective and we got by just fine with Cissokho given our limited funds at the time.

And Ilori is still only about 20 or 21 and has the qualities we need in a centre-back, none more important than his speed. Having a fast CB is a huge bonus. He's very raw still but I'm sure once he matures a bit he'll be a big coup for us.

Yeah true. Very good point there.

Part of me wishes Real Madrid was still interested. How amazing would it be to have a bidding war develop between two of the richest and fiercest rivals in the world? Not only would the price be driven up (we could probably aim for £90-95m), but we could have our pick of Sanchez, Pedro, Benzema or Di Maria as makeweights and still ask for £60+m. Was thinking about that last night but I had to stop because I was making myself sad haha.

But yeah, I trust we're strong enough negotiators to get it done. All our missed targets over the past couple of years just go to show we're not ones to be pushed over in negotiations.

Really? The Gulf Wars were about a dictatorship and oil. Afghanistan was about terrorism that happened to be Islamic. Give all the dodgy reasons you want for us going there but no one's ever used a Christian crusade against Islam as the reason.


&gt; I'm not calling for that; the RNLI shouldn't need to be a charity, it should be a state service.



The RNLI are an extremely well funded charity. The govt approached them a few years ago offering for them to come under govt control along with other maritime services. The RNLI couldn't provide the offshore service that the govt needed and the RNLI fairly didn't want govt oversight getting in the way (good enough reason in my opinion). The RNLI are a great organisation but they are not underfunded by any means. They also cannot provide the helicopter bound services provided by the forces which are the first option in most scenarios out at sea.

That depends heavily on what you imagined the worst case scenario to be.

seems to me right now though that weed is seen as cool by a lot of people which makes me kind of apprehensive because there's a pretty shitty culture around it, from my own experience weed seems to go hand in hand with people becoming useless degenerates, like hey i smoke weed, this makes me an absolute gangster and therefore i should behave like i live in an american ghetto and consciously reject taking any kind of responsability for myself.

* Next few decades. We win domestic domestic cups and place highly in the league (FA Cup, Division 1 respectively)

* \1978. Relegation

* Skip to early 2000s. West Ham academy effectively bring through one of the best English ""golden generation"" of youth academy graduates in recent years. Exciting times.

* No. 2003. Relegation. We sell the youngsters. The core (barring a few players) of the England team for the next generation are all sold.

* Promotion in 2005. Nice. Get bought by an Icelandic billionaire. Spend big to compete with the big teams. Finish higher and higher up the table until...

* Icelandic owner goes bankrupt. Overnight. A lot of debt. Close to going into Administration, and pulling a Portsmouth (look it up).... before they even did it.

* Relegation again in 2011

* PROMOTED! STRAIGHT BACK!

I may be completely wrong, but it makes sense that there was no evidence of at least the first case where nobody spoke out about it at the time despite there being so many others around.

We're selling him for a number of reasons.

1) He's the best striker in the world and he's 27, which means he's right in his prime and will **never** be worth the astronomical amount we're going to get for him again.

2) He's a complete nutter. He's bitten 3 guys in his career and been banned for the equivalent of 75% of a season. If he bites again, he'll get a year long ban probably. If we are his owners if/when this happens, we'll have an £80m log sitting at home twiddling his thumbs every Saturday.

3) Selling him now allows us to fill out the rest of the squad finally. Our depth last season was appalling. We basically scraped through the season using the first XI + Lucas and Allen. We have no game changers on the bench whatsoever. Getting £80m in (or £40-50m + Sanchez) would finally let us catch up with our rivals in terms of squad depth.

I chose Aurier because no other RB has had a good tournament. I was thinking of putting Lahm there but thought it might be cheating (although he did play there today).

David Luiz I put in purely for the peach of a free kick today (with his weaker foot too). There probably has been better CB's but oh well. For the other CB, Sakho I feel is a must as he's been incredible all tournament.

That is something I would dispute, at least with respect to the major questions. The Earth is warming and human activity is the primary cause - that much is not a cause of controversy within the scientific community. 

Scientific knowledge is fluid, of course; if it wasn't it would be dogma, not science. That does not mean we should sprinkle the reporting of the current state of the science with allusions to major differences of opinion when, in fact, very few actually exist. Numerous studies have quantified the extent of the consensus on anthropogenic global warming now (see [here](http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/2/024024), [here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2009EO030002/abstract) and [here](http://leisureguy.wordpress.com/2007/09/04/the-scientific-consensus-on-global-warming/), for example). Regardless of the methodology used - whether the study was looking at the conclusions of journal articles or at the stated opinions of scientists themselves - every single one that I've laid eyes on came to the conclusion that the consensus position is supported by an overwhelming (97% is a figure which seems to pop up a lot) majority of both scientists and academic papers. 

With this in mind, if it is the broadcasters' intent to present scientific opinion accurately, is it appropriate to be giving equal air time to both positions - to be presenting a debate where one does not really exist? That is only likely to mislead the public, in my view.

On the other hand, if a broadcaster were to decide to host a debate on the minutiae of climate sensitivity, and by extension the rate of the warming we're likely to see, then that's something I wouldn't have much trouble with. It would make for very dry viewing and there wouldn't be much of a conclusion to it, but hey, at least it wouldn't be misrepresenting the current state of the science.",0,1404514169,null,0,false,0,cioqj3m,t3_29tka2,t1_cioqj3m,t1_cioo76w,null,1434554188,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Whilst I agree with the other comments about banning it similar to smoking...

This isn't a universal problem with Cannabis. THC binds to fat. So you can chemically remove the THC from the leaves/bud with extreme ease.

And because of that, you can put it into butter. Or milk. So you can basically put it into thousands of different beverages and meals. There would be no smell and no taste.

This is something which is **literally always** overlooked by the media and politicians. The one and only way to consume Cannabis is via smoking a joint.

Alex Ferguson signed Veron for nearly £30m, and he was utterly shit in the Premiership. Hargreaves for a good chunk of money who barely played a game. £30m on Berbatov, for him to largely be a flop and leave for £4m after a few seasons. Yet I'd find it hard to criticise a manager who has basically won most Premier League titles that have been there to be won, even if he is a massive twat as a human being. 

Wenger, arguably one of the most astute and financially safe managers out there, signed Arshavin, who I'd say wasn't worth close to the £15m they paid for him and later left on a free. £6m on Andre Santos, who played probably less than twenty games and then left on a free after a few seasons. Jose Reyes did OK, but left for about half what Arsenal bought him for.

Benitez had Josemi, Dossena and and Aquilani (but also Alonso, Torres and Mascherano), Houllier had Diouf, Cheyrou and Diao (but also Hamann and Hyypia). There isn't any decent manager out there where you can't go through and selectively pick out some bad buys and good ones, just as for Rodgers I could point at Coutinho, Sturridge and Ibe and say they're some suave bits of business.

In particular FSG are new to all of this and figuring things out, so I'd expect it'll improve. And as a manager Rodgers is young too. I think £25m is overpaying for Lallana personally, and we have wasted a fair bit on bench warmers (though they're young ones at that, and Lucas was shit the first two seasons we had him), but I'd also credit Rodgers for not doing what the likes of Houllier have insisted on doing and putting the shite players into the side because they'd cost so much money, despite the fact they were shite.",0,1404516702,null,0,1404517111,0,ciordlr,t3_29u5d4,t1_ciordlr,t1_cioixqv,null,1434554658,10,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,10

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;Yes the QE's may not have cats and traps, but the decision to go with the B was made using the best information available at the time.

Oh come on, it was the wrong decision then and it's the wrong decision now. It has never not been a bad decision.

&gt;The cost to install EMALS and traps was pretty massive

The cost to **switch** to EMALS was massive, in part because we were wanting to switch half way through building the damn things and in part because the government stupidly said ""We've changed our mind and are going to buy EMALS"" then went to the *only* supplier of EMALS in the world and asked ""How much will that be then?"". If we'd had reactor powered carriers we could have had steam cats or EMALS.

There are very few major decisions one can point to in the procurement process of the QE class which have not been colossal fuck ups.

&gt;and there are several advantages to the B STOVL variant

Not many. Fundamentally for a carrier launched aircraft the C is a superior aircraft (unless your carrier is lacking in fundamental modern requirements such as cats and traps).

&gt;The ability to be used on other helicopter carriers, the higher sea states it can be used in.

True, but we're buying so few of them that we're not even able to properly outfit our carriers with F-35's, let alone buy enough for the RAF to actually use (which they're supposed to be getting). Let's face it, we're not the Americans, we don't have enough money to have a Marine Aviation Corps and we're not going to routinely sticking 35's on Ocean.

&gt;Furthermore, the QE will achieve similar sortie rates to the GRF class, with a crew a fraction of the size, that's pretty impressive.

true,Jlowry13,null,null,"The Orange order developed mostly by itself, started in 1795 it borrowed the lodge structure from the Freemasons but developed in its own way, with a much greater emphasis on the bible, so while there are very few British symbols on the arch in the picture there are far more symbols of biblical representations. While the Order does exist in England and Scotland, it doesn't have the same following in Wales with only one or two lodges. Although modern Orangism started in Ireland it is not uniquely Irish, indeed there are lodges in Togo.

The parading tradition actually came out of the yeomanry influence on early Orange men, and the bands started up around that.

Many Irish Protestants would be ethically Ulster-Scots, and that is evident in many of the music played across Ireland and our own dialect which is very similar to Scots (like how Robbie Burns wrote). There are more pipe bands in Ireland than there is in Scotland, from both communities. Not to mention highlands dancing is getting increasingly popular.

The way in which these influences arrived, via mass immigration to Ulster was pretty much entirely one way. There was way back common crossing back and forth between Ulster and Scotland but the plantations made it a wee bit more permanent, so there is a large common background, which developed separately with added influence from the Irish. Until relatively recently, with the influence of state education and the radio, there was very little cultural crossover either way, except in places like Liverpool, so while the culture is decidedly the same it is also different.

I do feel a connection to Britain, I am British, but I'm my own type of British, just like Pakistani immigrants see themselves as British and a whole manner of other races and creeds can call Britain their home and happily identify as such, it's a tradition that first started in the 17 hundreds when the red first met the blue, people of different creeds coming together, dispute their differences and their own identities they are still the same.

&gt; In **May 1997**, the newly elected Labour government launched the Strategic Defence Review (SDR) which re-evaluated every weapon system (active or in procurement) with the exception of the Eurofighter Typhoon and the Vanguard-class ballistic missile submarines. The report, published in July 1998 identified that aircraft carriers offered the following

...

&gt; As of September 2013 Queen Elizabeth is 80% complete internally[52] and her launch is scheduled for July 2014.[4] She will then be fitted out, with the crew moving aboard in May 2016,[4] sea trials begin in October 2016[4] and she will be handed over to the Royal Navy in ""early 2017"".[84] F-35 operations begin in 2018[84] ahead of **an ""operational military capability"" in 2020.**[84]


OK.. *why the fuck*.. does it take *23 years* from start of planning to *start* of useful service. Even if you go from today, that's *6 years*. I'm sure it's not a simple thing to operate but really? F-35 is a US plane that's been around since 2006. or is this wikipedia page out of date?

edit: ok thanks guys i see now the F35 variant they need is nowhere near ready. the famous ""carrier with no planes"". so no point finishing it quicker then, if there's nothing else it can use? the carrier itself is on schedule?

Also worth noting this:

&gt; The carriers, expected to remain in service for fifty years, were designed for but not with catapults and arrestor wires. The carriers were thus planned to be ""future proof"", allowing them to operate a generation of CATOBAR aircraft beyond the F-35.",0,1404520525,null,0,1404558572,0,ciosnd2,t3_29ui2p,t1_ciosnd2,t3_29ui2p,null,1435481059,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

This guy lives directly below me! I can't stand him, he's been driving me crazy that I'm now at the stage where I know I NEED to do something about him (he's impacting my mental health), but haven't quite yet worked out what I should do! 

As /u/ARushandaPush mentioned, his mental health is definitely an issue!
He repeatedly bangs against something in his flat - it sounds like someone using a hammer. 
He loudly opens and closes doors in his flat over and over again.
I can hear him moving around from room to room and talking - Although he may actually be singing and dancing.
He slams his front door repeatedly (they're heavy doors). Opens and closes it, slamming it multiple times at once, so it's not like he's leaving his flat to go out and slamming it on his way out. The force used to slam the door makes my whole flat shake.
He plays music every now and then, mostly it's the same CD.
He's always using what I think must be a blender. If it's not a blender, who knows what it is.
Definitely some OCD behaviour patterns going on, all of which are noisy!

He doesn't follow a mon-fri 9-5 pattern. He makes these noises in the early hours of the morning/in the day/evening/night, whenever he wants.
Most days I am woken up by him at around 5am but it can be earlier- running a bath between 2am and 3am seems a regular occurrence. I haven't slept properly for so long. I hear him when I'm trying to get so sleep, I get woken up by him. I'm so stressed out because of him! 

It has made me question if I'm hearing noises that aren't there, struggle to separate what's real and what's in my head. I'm not sure what silence is anymore as I am so used to him making noise at bizarre times that when he isn't home my brain creates noise to fill the silence. It's made me get very obsessive so that I could try and work out what's going on - picture me at 4am with my ear pressed against the floor having only slept for an hour, following the noise from room to room like some sort of sleep deprived spy on a mission.


You guys may love him for his moves around town and think he's harmless but it is depressing to have to live right above him.


Sorry if this has turned into bit of a rant, as you can probably tell it's a sore subject for me. Any advice about what I could do would be welcome!

The ramp is a more serious downgrade compared to the ""cats and traps"" that are used to launch and catch aircraft on most modern carriers.  This limits the type and range/loading of fixed-winged aircraft that can be operated from the ship.

Personally, I was really against the signing about a month ago, but now I think Chelsea should just pay the fee. 19 Million pounds for one of the best left backs in europe is not bad at all. I know he's 29, but he still has good years in him. Not to mention that Chelsea have been doing great business in the transfer market, and all premier league clubs are going to see a big increase in tv revenue, so money really isn't a problem.

Luis will upgrade us at LB, RB [azpi will move back there], thus making the job easier for our LW and RW. I think buying Luis would definitely help us win the premier league for the next two seasons at the least.

Everyone is going on about Rodriguez and Shaw. I'm not going to lie, I know very little about those two. From what I've heard they both have sky high potential. But I really think it would be a mistake to buy a young, unproven LB instead of Luis, especially since Mourinho wants to win this year. If we get Rodriguez and he struggles, we will look like idiots.

true,Haleorn,null,null,"Don't take it personally, its just that for energy providers fuel debt is already a major problem to deal with. Something you have not mentioned is that in your situation British Gas will normally ask for a deposit (£200-300 total depending on their assessment of you afaik, but is X amount for gas Y amount for electricity) to hold as security and use to clear your debt should you fail to pay in future. If this was not even offered, it means they consider you a clear and obvious risk for fuel debt and would prefer you on a pay-as-you-go type meter.

If they did offer it with a deposit needed, you need to pay it or they won't take you of course. If they didn't, then based on your description of yourself and your circumstances I'd say it is most likely because you have acquired too much debt, too quickly in recent years. This often throws automated scoring systems particularly hard, but is a good reason to reject someone from a business perspective. It is not normal for someone with a thin credit file (less than 6 years old or with little activity) to have the level of debt you do, even if its mostly secured and/or with a guarantor at your back. Different companies score the same person differently for their own reasons - British Gas (as a utility) prefer long-term stable credit while your history is both short and shows credit rapidly expanding.

true,Thapricorn,lfc-08-09-grey-kit,null,"As a LFC fan living in Seattle, and having played against him myself back in the youth system, I think I could shed some light on him as a player:

Yedlin is fast. I'm sure you saw bursts, but you don't understand. He is FAST. Fucking ridiculously fast. Fastest human being I've ever met. I would bet quite a lot of money that he could beat Sterling and Sturridge in a foot race from what I've seen of all of them. I had the unfortunate pleasure of attempting to beat him with a dribble or two during drills at training camps, but even if I knocked it into space beyond him or caught him wrong footed, his pace would make up for it and he'd be on the ball within seconds. 

He's smart. That's one thing I don't think many people have pointed out from his WC performances. At the Sounders, he would often be far up front and risk getting caught on the break. However, his pace would make up for it, but he'd be fighting a 2 v 1 scenario with an opposing midfielder and striker. He does an excellent job of either closing down and marshalling the man in possession, or takes the 50/50 route and closes down the player attempting to receive the ball. He's only able to do the second because his pace allows him to give the dribbler space, as he knows he's fast enough to beat him if he tries to dribble around him. Any other defender would be absolutely fucked in those scenarios, but Yedlin seems very calm and confident throughout.

On the flip side; he's a little naive. Often times he will be caught too far forward as he tries to make every single overlap a success. He needs to pick his runs better and learn when to drop back instead of wasting energy and positioning by overlapping when it's not on. This, however, is nothing a few months in the gym can't fix. Bulk up a bit and he'll be good to go. 

He's also not the strongest guy. One of the main problems he has with MLS strikers is just how strong they are. They may not be as fast or technically gifted as him, but they are able to shrug Yedlin off the ball with ease. He's conceded quite a few easy crosses due to opponents shoving him aside, and using that space to pass. 

Overall though, if Brendan can get his hands on this 20 year old right back, LFC's outside back position could be solved for YEARS. I can really see him developing into one of the world's best- which is especially important considering how shallow the talent pool is for outside backs these days. He's personally the best player I've ever played against or with at any level in my short and humble career. Do whatever it takes to get him.

true,SteveMallam,null,null,"I did in MBA with the OU finishing about 3 years ago.
The MBA is much more expensive than most of their undergrad courses so not sure how this compares but...

At the start of each module I got a big box in the post containing a stack of A4 books, a couple of ""proper"" textbooks and various CDs / DVDs. The course consisted of working through the course books doing the reading and exercises it suggested and occasionally referring to the other materials.

About once every 4-6 weeks there was a ""TMA"" (tutor marked assessment) to submit. This was your traditional Uni assignment (usually a number of essay questions or a project of some sort).
They are submitted electronically, your tutor marks and returns to you with comments. I found a wide range in quality of tutors - from those who marked within 3-4 days (and apologised if it took a week) and gave comprehensive feedback and those who took several weeks and gave very little. I heard horror stories from people who submitted their third assignment before receiving scores from their first so YMMV.

We also had a group tutorial in person timed to help us prepare for the TMAs and exam (at the end of every module). These were really good - a full Saturday or Sunday - but in my case usually involved a drive from Newcastle to York or Leeds.
For one of my courses the nearest groups were Manchester and Nottingham so I signed up for the online variant. It didn't work at all - tutor was fairly ineffective and the group sessions didn't work/happen so I might as well have been on the standard course and just not gone.
Once a module in most of the courses there was a longer 2–3 day session involving students from multiple groups. These were compulsory and more effort to get to. Most of mine were in Stirling and involved time off work. They were really good though, if you could avoid the trap of late night drinking!

I suspect the undergrad courses probably don't involved quite so much material or face-to-face work -total cost for the MBA was around 15k. At that price it's a lot of money, but much better value than most MBA courses.
I'm now 40 so it falls into the category of ""glad I did it, wouldn't do it again""
You can guarantee if you're working and studying part time, something will come up at work at the same time a big assignment is due so it can get pretty exhausting.

If you're keen to study though, I'd say that on the whole the OU was good value and for the most part effective.

(S.) 61

&gt;The maximum sentence on Count 1 is one of 5 years’ imprisonment, on each of Counts 2 ‐ 9 it is  one of 2 year’s  imprisonment, and on each of Counts 10 ‐ 12 it is one of 10 years’ imprisonment.

&gt;On Counts 3,4,5,7,9&amp;12 the **equivalent offence today is assault by penetration which carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment** and would be likely, to involve a starting point (given the severity of the psychological damage to ‘C’) of around 8 years’ imprisonment on Counts 3,4,5,7, &amp; 9 and a starting point of around 4 years’   imprisonment on Count 12 ",0,1404546966,null,0,false,0,ciozsj8,t3_29tt4a,t1_ciozsj8,t1_ciojmve,null,1434559854,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,collinsl02,null,null,"Historical perspective:

During the reign of Queen Elizabeth I back in the 1600s, there were three Squadrons of ships within the Royal Navy - The Admiral’s squadron wore a red flag, the Vice-Admiral’s wore a white and the Rear-Admiral’s wore a blue. Of course, back then there was no union jack, the upper-left corner would have been empty.

As the fleet grew, each squadron became too large for one Flag Officer (admiral, vice admiral, rear admiral, and now commodore) to handle effectively, so the number of flag ranks was tripled and each squadron got an admiral, a vice-admiral and a rear-admiral. The order of seniority of the squadrons was kept, so that the admiral of the red squadron would have been in overall command of the whole fleet, with the rear-admiral of the blue squadron being the newest flag officer. I say the admiral of the Red squadron would have been in charge of everything, but because of that fact they did not have an admiral of the red squadron - the Admiral of the Fleet held the position of being in charge of everything, and that was an appointment for life.

The promotion of flag officers also happened across the squadrons, so upon promotion from the rear-admiral of the blue squadron, a flag officer would move to be the rear-admiral of the white squadron, then rear-admiral of the red squadron, then vice-admiral of the blue squadron and the whole thing would start again. The only exception was, as mentioned above, that no one could be promoted to Admiral of the Red squadron. That is, until 1805, when the post was created to reward exceptionally good Admirals. 

Then in 1862 provision was made for more than one admiral of the fleet to be appointed, allowing more mobility in the chain of command (previously you would have had to wait for the next officer above you to die or retire before promotion) and for better retention of skills. In 1870 admirals of the fleet were also made to retire at 70, eliminating some of the more doddery candidates and also ensuring better promotion prospects for more junior flag officers. In the 1980s/1990s the post of Admiral of the Fleet was eliminated from the promotion chain and once all the current holders have left it will cease to exist.

And in 1864 the flag squadrons were dropped, as it no longer made any sense at all to have individual vessels assigned to a squadron that they were not sailing with and that they were on the other side of the world from in a lot of cases.

So the white ensign was allocated to the Royal Navy, the red ensign was allocated to the Merchant Vessels and private vessels that were British registered, and the Blue ensign was used for naval auxiliary (RFA - Royal Fleet Auxiliary) vessels.

These days, to distinguish which rank of flag officer is aboard which ship, one of the following flags will be flown from the pennant position - Admirals of the Fleet fly the Union Flag, Admirals fly the St. George Flag, Vice-Admirals the St George Flag with a red sphere in the top left quarter, and Rear-Admirals fly the same but with a red sphere in the top and lower left quarters of the flag.",0,1404547756,null,0,false,0,ciozxpw,t3_29ttif,t1_ciozxpw,t1_cioj9xv,null,1434560258,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

I have more posts on /r/gunners and /r/reddevils than /r/liverpoolfc as a Liverpool fan. They're never really downvoted as they're not really inflammatory or insulting. The club subs are good but one of the only reasons I post is for discussion. I want replies especially if people disagree with me and I find it's much more likely people will hold a different view on other clubs subs. Not everyone has to agree on things or it's boring but there is a right way to doing it and a most definite wrong way.

I don't comment on posts which will clearly blow up but I just hardly find the need to post on here tbh.

Hello. My name is  and I reside at *********************************************.


I am writing to you because I am concerned about the Transatlantic trade and investment partnership.

Specifically I am concerned about the efforts of certain corporations on both sides of the atlantic to include an Investment Arbitration clause.

Such a clause would mean EU member states could soon find domestic laws to protect the public interest challenged in secretive, offshore tribunals where national laws have no weight and politicians no powers to intervene. There is no right of appeal on the merits of the case. Yet they can overthrow the sovereignty of parliaments and the rulings of supreme courts!

So whenever an american corporation finds that laws in the area of public health, environmental or social protection interfere with their profits, they will have the ability to seek reparations from the British Government. The threat of legal action from corporations involved can and WILL have an effect upon our nation's legislation.

Letters from the New York and DC law firms coming up to the Canadian government on virtually every new environmental regulation and proposition in the last five years. They involved dry-cleaning chemicals, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, patent law. Virtually all of the new initiatives were targeted and most of them never saw the light of day.

Here in Britain we need legislation that protects consumers and the environment, and I fear that the threat of huge lawsuits will cause the British government to have to water down any such future legislation to the detriment of the people and consumers.

Furthermore this is in direct contradiction to the wishes of the Transatlantic Consumer Dialogue (supported by consumer groups from the EU and the US) which has said that the TTIP “should not include investor-state dispute resolution. Investors should not be empowered to sue governments to enforce the agreement in secretive private tribunals, and to skirt the well-functioning domestic court systems and robust property rights protections in the United States and European Union.”

So, in conclusion as your constituent I ask that you oppose the inclusion of any Investment Arbitration Clause in the TTIP and indeed to oppose any form of the TTIP that includes such a clause.

PoA and breaks aren't counted as work and the WTD only counts work towards the weekly limits. It is therefore possible to be on duty for 15hrs and only have half of that count as work for the purposes of the WTD due to the amount of time spent on break/PoA. Container drivers and fridge drivers are the two main ones who are likely to be able to do max hours on duty under EU Drivers Hours regs but never come close to the limit of the WTD due to the amount of time in a week they spend sat on loading bays with the tachograph on break or PoA.

The whole industry is stacked top to bottom with dumb arses who seem to think they have to work max hours to earn a living and are happy to park up in laybys so they can pocket their night out money. They seem completely incapable of understanding the concept of supply and demand and that if hours were restricted to 48hrs duty time inclusive of breaks and PoA that the resultant demand for drivers would put up wages meaning they'd earn the same as they do now for fewer hours.

I remember working for an employer in the run up to the WTD being introduced when wage negotiations were ongoing. It was a leading national parcel company and we were the night trunk drivers with us all working 11-12hrs a night, 5 nights a week so doing 55-60hrs. At that point there was no PoA and it was assumed a max 48hr week full stop so the company was going to need to employ more drivers and couldn't afford to lose any as it was obvious there was going to be a massive increase in demand. In the early 2000s there was already a driver shortage and you could actually tell an employer to piss off on Friday and be in a truck working for someone else on Monday. Wage increases being talked about were 20% by the management with the union. Then news of the PoA came to light and the wage increases being offered dropped through the floor.

Edit:  Personally I think the F35s will be pretty damn capable aircraft.  It might take a couple of goes (Harrier FA1s were pretty poor, as were the first generation of F4s) but I think they'll be fine.  I'd be more worried about the expense of maintaining them that their capabilities.  

What really concerns me is that we *still* do not have any real AWACS system for the carriers.

Imagine air combat to be like hide and seek in a field on a very dark night.  Nobody can see anything until they're right in front.  You all have torches, but when you turn it on everyone can see where you are, while you can only see down the beam of your torch.

Some things she has tried:
- Career counselling, mock interviews, ‘bumping into’ valuable people near their place of work, cold calling/cold emailing, treating professionals to coffee for a ‘chat’, professional edits of her cv/applications, and wearing psychologically stimulating colours to interviews.

Though when she gets desperate, she resorts to reed or indeed in order to find admin jobs in the arts. She volunteers when able (though that is getting too expensive now), and is on linked in and is signed up to about 6 temp agencies (3 are arts). She doesn’t go to many events, because she is just very ashamed of her effort:failure ratio. She was particularly stung by a recent experience of volunteering for some time at a museum, being asked to apply for a role (which is what she was already doing as a volunteer), interviewing (and writing a report to go the extra mile) and being rejected two hours later. ‘you are fantastic, we went with the other guy’ She is socially anxious as a result of her regular rejections and doesnt feel comfortable at events anymore.

She is not picky and will take anything to ‘get in.’ Once in, her plan is to move into either education, curating or development -as she has unpaid experience in all of these. She definitely researches the places she applies, as each application I am told is about 10 pages on average.

She is growing concerned that she graduated in 2011 and her relevant experience is buried under temp jobs, but with no cash to volunteer, she thinks she will just be ignored. She’s 30, thinks she's too old for another internship (she’s done two), or to apprentice :/",0,1404555218,null,0,false,0,cip13x1,t3_29td40,t1_cip13x1,t1_ciogw3g,null,1434561061,1,false,UKJobs,t5_2seb3,1

For anyone interested, Fragglemook [made this comment on a thread about the arrest of Harris 10 months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1lbmzb/tv_presenter_rolf_harris_charged_in_uk_with_nine/cbxph5c).

I'll summarise some of the salient quotes:

&gt; ...as a for shagging teens in the seventies and eighties, big deal! Everyone was doing it, it was part of the culture back then, it was a different world back then...    
&gt; ...Guys like Rolf were having young girls with out of control libidos launch their bodies at him on a daily basis back then...      
&gt; ....as for the CPS considering this to be in the public good, well that just says a hell of a lot about how this witch hunt is politically motivated...       
&gt; ...This paedo-dragnet is relatively new... I think we have to tone it down a bit somehow...

Given the nature of that comment - victim blaming and taking the ""hysteria"" angle - [I replied rather curtly](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1lbmzb/tv_presenter_rolf_harris_charged_in_uk_with_nine/cby08pl) and ended up parroting his position back to him in a way that I think most people can understand. I can only surmise he took great umbrage. as the upshot was that he sent me a PM wishing me physical harm:

&gt; [""I hope you're walking alone one night and someone stabs you in the head.""](http://i.imgur.com/41iae8Z.png)

It's always heartening to see your conclusion about someone's mindset be reinforced like this. 

Fragglemook, I can only conclude that you didn't end up going to speak to a rape counsellor (again) about their work in a bid to educate yourself about sexual assault cases etc. and in particular the nature of victim blaming, as I suggested. Your opinion is still fucked-up to high heaven.

Remember when I said: 

&gt; ""I barely even comment when people have been found guilty or not, because it is not my place""?

Given that Harris was found guilty of abusing several girls who were under the age of 13 initially do you see the sense in not drawing conclusions without the full facts? I notice you mention the 8 year old in your comment and dismiss her memory... did you want Harris to be found innocent no matter the evidence presented: is it just a general opinion that women lie about things like this?

Having said all that, now with more information you seem not to have changed your opinion at all. That speaks of a deeper issue you have, really, though I'm no psychologist. I wonder how many more people will have to be found guilty before you consider your position might be slightly on the wrong side of right.",0,1404555888,null,0,false,0,cip17d2,t3_29tlsi,t1_cip17d2,t1_ciod3fk,null,1434561148,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,cstross,null,null,"The jump ramp is a *terrible* design; it means the only fixed-wing aircraft the carrier can fly are STOVL aircraft like the Harrier or F35. The US carriers, thanks to their catapults, can launch heavier, more effective fighters -- the F35 and Harrier sacrifice a chunk of payload capacity in return for the vertical lift capability.

Furthermore, to operate a carrier air wing effectively you need airborn radar support. The US carriers, with their catapults, can field the [Northrup Grumman E-2 Hawkeye](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_E-2_Hawkeye), which provides airborn early warning of attack on the fleet so that fighters can be directed to defend against it. Currently there are no STOVL-capable AEW aircraft. It's conceivable that a version of the V-22 Osprey could be developed to do the job -- at a significant additional cost that nobody is talking about -- but right now the Queen Elizabeth would be dependent on radar-equipped helicopters *or* working as an adjunct an American carrier *or* simply avoiding going near  enemies with 1950s-grade-or-better aviation capability.

The drawbacks to the catapult option:

* It was proposed to fit the QE with a new electromagnetic cat, like the Gerald Ford class. Trouble is, it draws a huge amount of electricity to run these -- power which would end up coming from the gas turbine engines the QE is driven by, eating into its cruise range. (The Ford class, being nuclear powered, don't suffer from this problem.) Also note that the electromagnetic cat hadn't actually been tested at the time of the proposal. **Should have gone with a nuclear carrier design.**

* To match the cat and trap option, the carrier would then have gone with the cheaper naval version of the F-35, the F-35C, rather than the Marine Corps' Harrier-replacement boondoggle, the F-35B. The F-35C has an arrester hook and no vertical lift fan; the fan bay is therefore available for holding additional weapons, fuel, and avionics, making it a more competent aircraft. But RR and BAe Systems are both big contractors for the F-35B, and would lose out big-time if they lost the UK contract.  **Unacceptable for political reasons.**

* An *even better* option would be to shitcan the stupid and pointless F-35 stealth fighter -- stealth technology is built into airframes with a design life of 30 years; radar signal processing tech advances a generation every five years right now: any given stealth generation is obsolete within 15 years of its introduction -- and buy cheap, available-today, proven F/A-18B Hornets. Alternatively, pay BAe to develop the ""Naval Eurofighter"" variant they originally planned for -- the French Rafale was a fork of the naval Eurofighter program back in the late 1980s -- or buy Rafales. **Unacceptable for political reasons.**

TL:DR; if the carrier had a cat, then there'd be a bunch of flexible options for what to put on it and we wouldn't be stuck carrying the can for an insanely expensive and massively overbudget stealth fighter shaped catastrophe (the F-35B).",0,1404555924,null,0,false,0,cip17j6,t3_29ui2p,t1_cip17j6,t1_ciozof2,null,1434561140,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

A cynic may have a general lack of faith or hope in the human species or people motivated by ambition, desire, greed, gratification, materialism, goals, and opinions that a cynic perceives as vain, unobtainable, or ultimately meaningless and therefore deserving of ridicule or admonishment. It is a form of jaded prudence, and other times, realistic criticism or skepticism.

I love my OU courses, and my tutors have been excellent. The work load *is* hard once you hit second year. First year I fitted around my life easily and it wasn't much of a commitment until the very end when the assessments got larger, but in second year the amount of reading just shot up. I would wake up, go to work, come home about 6, have dinner and then study until 10.30 most days. Weekends were all study. April and May were complete write offs this year with two assessments and then study for two June exams and I didn't much leave the house. If you do a full course, be prepared to sacrifice a *lot* of your social life for it.  Also bear in mind that you are entirely self motivated. I really want to do this course and do well in it, but when it got to March this year all I could do was take one look at my books, open to the next module page and think ""Fuck this, I can't be bothered. "" Except I *had* to be bothered, otherwise I'd fail my TMA. That was really, really hard. 

Take advantage of the tutorials and day schools they offer, because they are SO useful and give you so much extra information and really help you enjoy the subject. 

I gained a student loan for my second and third years even though I have a previous degree, because my last degree was Scottish, so I came out with a BA. Because this is a BA (Hons), it's classed as superior so I qualify for a loan. Have a look in to that if you can because it's ridiculously handy.

true,[deleted],null,null,"It is a hard enough thing to run away from home in Cardiff to become a warrior for the caliphate, it is quite another to do it from Melbourne. But in Australia too last week there were stories and photos of local Muslim boys who had somehow managed to travel half the circumference of the globe to take part in a conflict their surfing school-mates had probably never even heard of.

Reading about this in an Aussie paper in a coffee bar in Sydney I found myself wondering how this could have happened. Or, more precisely, why it doesn’t seem to happen for anyone who isn’t a Muslim. Coptic Christians from Ethiopia are not to be found trekking across the intervening desert to take up arms on behalf of their persecuted Egyptian brothers; 17-year-old Huddersfield Catholics and west London Greek Orthodox altarboys are not en route to Ukraine to take part in the struggle for Donetsk. If, God forbid, there were widespread violence in socialist Venezuela, I would not expect the Pilger battalion of British teen leftists to turn up, red-arm-banded, in Caracas. So why, Muslims might ask themselves, echoing Mario Balotelli, is it always us?

This is an awkward question both to pose and to answer, partly because there are so many people who are absolutely and easily convinced that they do know the reason. They assure me on Twitter most weeks that the problem is Islam as a faith. Uniquely among religions, they assert, Islam is literal not interpretative, and that means it is by nature aggressive, violent and fundamentalist.

I don’t believe this for a second. There is now and has always been dispute within Islam as to the meaning and application of texts. It is susceptible to reform and schism just as Christianity, Judaism and other religions and political credos have been. Furthermore, as a religion with 1.2 billion adherents, of whom well over 1.1 billion manage to make it through life without hefting an AK47, attending a training camp in Waziristan or watching a judicial amputation, the generalisation doesn’t tell you about how Islam is actually practised.

And yet the problem remains. In the 1950s and 1960s the insurgencies around the world were ideological or nationalistic. Whether it was by the Shining Path in Peru, the Maoists of Nepal or even the fascist bombers of Italian railway stations, people were being killed by rebels in the name of political ideas. But although killers such as Anders Breivik and Timothy McVeigh suggest the persistent potency of certain far-right ideologies, today’s victims of IEDs, car bombs and mass abductions are most likely to be killed — according to their killers — in the name of the Prophet.

There is no non-Muslim equivalent of what, until a few days ago was Isis but are now the forces of the self-appointed caliph Ibrahim. There isn’t a Christian Boko Haram. Pakistan is not convulsed by militant communists, but by its religious extremists in the local Taliban and other groups, who between them may have killed 50,000 people in the past ten years. There is no country that is not Muslim that attempts to enforce sanctions for apostasy or has the death penalty for blasphemy. Vaccinators are not being assassinated by Jews, nor voters having their fingers chopped off by Baptists.

Again, it’s obvious that most Muslims do none of these things. They want to eat good food, lead decent, peaceful lives and watch their children grow up. And, in fact, ordinary Muslims are by far the biggest casualties of the jihadis and the zealots of apostasy. Pakistani Shia are massacred by Sunni extremists; Sunni civilians are snatched by Iraqi Shia death squads; the Syrian civil war has seen as many as 170,000 deaths in three years. By contrast the past 25 years of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict accounts for just under 10,000.

What is therefore doubly curious about this is the lack of a sense of Muslim outrage about what some other Muslims are doing. Who, for example, protests about the death penalty in many parts of the United States? Well, people in the United States and other western countries do. Judicial execution has been abolished in almost all formerly Christian countries despite its explicit sanction in the Bible.

Who complains about creationism being taught in schools? Among others, many Christians do. Is any campaign against Israeli actions complete without a complement of not-in-my-name Jews? Hardly, and that’s a healthy thing. By far the most effective critics of an action or a policy are those on the inside.

Yet I must have missed the sense of Muslim outrage at, for example, the Sultan of Brunei’s adoption of the most medieval form of Sharia, or at the persecution of religious (including Muslim) minorities in ostensibly Muslim countries.

It isn’t that some Muslim organisations aren’t trying. The two most recent campaigning statements of the Muslim Council of Britain concern condemnation of jihadi recruitment for Isis and female genital mutilation. They deserve credit for that.

But it is obvious that this self-policing isn’t what floats the boat of Muslims politically. There’ll be the occasional good statement, but if, say, Israel bombs Gaza, then suddenly social media will fill up with Islamic outrage, careful commentators will become passionate, marchers will hit the streets. Why is there no Muslim Peace Movement campaigning for an end to violence in Muslim countries, where the victims are Muslims and the perpetrators are Muslims? Where it might make the most difference.

A couple of weeks ago listeners heard a depressing report from Bradford. Sima Kotecha, the BBC correspondent, was interviewing young Pakistani-British boys about Iraq. Would they go and fight for Isis or other groups? “I would go. They’re brothers,” said one. “You’re going to live as a Muslim, die as a Muslim, innit?” said another.

There is at work here what can only be called a victim mentality — paradoxical given the power and size of Islam — which casts Muslims as being eternally oppressed and eternal victims.

This week the supreme leader of Iran, arguably the most powerful Muslim religious leader in the world, tweeted his “analysis of recent events in the region”. Point 1 was: “Main enemy: security and intelligence services of the West.” Point 2 was their tactics: “Sowing sectarian conflicts”, launching proxy wars and “fabricating forged alternatives of Islam”. Neither he nor any other Muslim had any real responsibility for any of it.

A fantasy of victimhood is difficult enough when it enchants just a nation. When it enthrals a world religion it is terrifying. ",0,1404557861,null,0,false,0,cip1hhg,t3_29w2it,t1_cip1hhg,t1_cip1fi3,null,1434561364,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Well to be honest it didn't make much tangible difference. I was already in my mid 30s and in a senior middle management position at a large IT company. There was no promotion or pay increase attached, I was really just preparing for the next promotion.
As it happened I then decided to go back to a more technical role with some sales too. I'm actually getting paid quite a bit more but the MBA is kind of irrelevant.
What it DID do was give me a wider appreciation of business and a bit more confidence in high level meetings. I'm not sure if it made any difference to getting my current job but I'll ask my boss when I see him! As someone who used to do a lot of recruiting and interviewing, I will say that anything you can add to your CV to distinguish yourself and make your CV stand out will help. It's not about being more qualified, it's about being more memorable. As an example I hired a junior developer who had worked as an artisan baker and done his technical qualifications part time. That was enough to make him stand out as someone with initiative and get an interview. To be fair he gave a fantastic interview and several years later he's a principal developer for a consultancy and one of the best engineers I've worked with.

100% agree with you there, but I don't think that is a good line of argument for legalisation. To me it reads we can't control drugs and the problems they bring to society so we will concede and legalise them.

True, but at present due to the means by which weed is acquired it is still a gateway drug. Once it is legalised and in open society this would also perhaps disappear. 


When looking at this issues I think we should to a large extent dismiss the criminal aspects and the whole war on drugs and look at the social and health implications.

So by making weed more legal and more accessible, less people would try it?

This is the same fallacy used to justify barbaric laws in the first place.The fact is... people who want to use drugs simply do. They don't give a damn what the government says or does - they just do. And thats true from Cannabis users right up to Heroin users.

You are overlooking the uncountable percentage of people who don't use precisely because of those reasons. Look how many people drink and smoke knowing the medical implications, it's the law that stops people not the health concerns.

true,ceelo_purple,null,null,"That seems like a pretty good spread of job sites. My background is performing arts, rather than GLAM, so I may be unaware of some specialist sites, but she's got all the ones I'd expect to see listed there.

Career counselling - Good, so long as it's industry-specific  
Mock interviews - Also good  
‘Bumping into’ valuable people near their place of work - Kiiind of sketchy? She probably need to change up her approach here.  
Cold calling/cold emailing - Not verboten or anything, but I've pretty much never known it to work.  
Treating professionals to coffee for a ‘chat’ - This I *have* known to work.  
Professional edits of her cv/applications - Good  
Wearing psychologically stimulating colours to interviews - Aaaand there's the desperation you mentioned...

Don't feel bad about the temping. It's normal for anybody who doesn't get a break straight out of uni and doesn't have wealthy parents to support them. (Those who *do* have wealthy parents can afford to do unpaid internships indefinitely and spend their time networking without worrying about bills, which is why the arts sector is so demographically skewed toward posh people!) I did four years of it before I got my foot in the door and I consider myself lucky.

Volunteering is good and it gets your name out there, but it helps to bounce around a lot. I've seen plenty of former volunteers and interns get hired, but I've *never* seen a volunteer hired straight away at the place they were volunteering. Employers get too used to seeing you as unpaid labour. All the successful volunteers used their volunteer experience at Place A to get short-term paid work at Place B or C, then came back to Place A later having psychologically put themselves in the category of Person-Worth-Paying-For. That's just my subjective experience from observing the career paths of co-workers, though.

When you say she's on LinkedIn do you mean she has a profile or that she's actively involved in discussion groups and using it to interact with people? LinkedIn isn't as crucial in the arts as it is in other industries (IT, B2B sales, etc), but it does provide a place for her to do distance networking.

&gt;She doesn’t go to many events, because she is just very ashamed of her effort:failure ratio. 

You have to help her out of this. This is what's going to kill her dreams. Firstly, that ratio is the exact same ratio that exists for *the industry as a whole*. It is not a personal reflection on her or a sign that she's failed. It's just a sign that the whole sector is *fucking ridiculous* and that nobody gets anywhere without epic tenacity and a lucky break. The number one thing you can do to be a supportive spouse right now is to make her understand that and try to boost her self-esteem, because otherwise her lucky break is going to happen at an event or conference that she's *not attending because she's given up.*

There's a lot of mythology around the arts, some of it helpful, some of it harmful. There's an expectation that it will be the number one driving force in your life, which is amazing if you want to work somewhere with motivated, enthusiastic co-workers, but can be a real bitch when it comes to things like family planning or recent rise of unpaid internships because ""If you *really* loved the job, you'd do it for free."" 

What this means for your wife is that her mindset that she will take any job to 'get in' and then specialise and start attending events when she's got her foot in the door is back-to-front. In the arts you have to act like you're *already* working in the industry in order to *start* working in the industry, because of that mythology that says this isn't just what you do, it's who you *are*. That this is what you'd do if you won the lottery. That it's what you do even if you knew you'd never make a penny from it. That it's what you do, because you're not quite sure how to *not* do it. 

It's an incredibly powerful narrative, both within the industry and in popular culture. The starving artist in a garret. The plucky chorus girl who meticulously learns all the lines and blocking unprompted and is the only one prepared when the leading lady breaks her ankle. These stories have a huge cultural pull. Your wife's failure to attend events may be social anxiety based, but to people who've absorbed those stories it looks like she doesn't *care* enough and that can be poisonous to success.

Okay so practical steps...

Reading the trade press every day and linking to at least one article in an industry LinkedIn group, on her blog or or on Twitter with a short comment. 

Replying to or commenting on other people's comments about industry stuff, starting to have conversations.

Attending as many exhibitions and gallery openings as possible. If possible you should go with her to be her wingman and keep her confidence up. She's an arts attendee and has every right to be there, but she should also be people-watching to get a sense of who the regulars are at these things and so that they get a sense that *she* is a regular and that she ""belongs"".

Go to post-show talks and artist Q&amp;As. Ask intelligent questions. Reference other recent events and the stuff she's been reading in the industry press. Send the message - to both others and herself - that she understands this milieu. That she *belongs* here.

Go to open space and innovation events. They're usually free and she won't be the only person there who's not in paid industry employment. Find people who're in the same position she is. Collaborate. Share ideas. She needs to be on the radar of peers as well as potential empoyers.

Go to full on conferences. I'm saving this till last because there's a cost implication and she won't be able to take a wingman, so it will help if she's done the openings and innovation events first. Going up to people cold is terrifying. Going up to people and saying ""Didn't I see you at Culture Hack Day last spring? You were working on a new way of presenting artifact descriptions in multiple languages, weren't you?"" or ""Hello again, we met at the Grayson Perry opening in Manchester. Nice to see you again. What did you think of the keynote?"" is slightly less excruciating.

&gt;She definitely researches the places she applies, as each application I am told is about 10 pages on average.

Hmm. Might be worth taking a closer look at that. One of the inevitable outcomes of the borked supply and demand  ratio is that even the dullest arts jobs attract a ridiculous number of applications that somebody then has to wade through. Especially since lots of arts orgs can't afford a dedicated HR department, so somebody's having to read all those applications on *top* of doing their regular job. (I've been on both ends of the pile and the level of skim-reading can be utterly brutal.) Succinct is good, provided all the key information's being conveyed. It's harder to say anything more concrete without examples. PM me if you're interested in swapping some.

What I meant was mostly about understanding organisational goals and recent events/exhibitions for the interview phase. Being able to effortlessly reference their recent endeavours (""Oh, yes. I saw the photorealism exhibit. Well worth the entry fee, particularly the diner paintings."") will make her sound more collegial and bolster the sense that she belongs. (As well as providing a small ego-boost for the interviewing org which never hurts!)

&gt; She’s 30, thinks she's too old for another internship (she’s done two), or to apprentice

I think so too, but as you may have noticed, I have some fairly strong political views about the effect internships are having on the arts, so maybe I'm not the best barometer for that.",0,1404560325,null,0,1404560862,0,cip1uvo,t3_29td40,t1_cip1uvo,t1_cip13x1,null,1434561566,1,false,UKJobs,t5_2seb3,1

&gt;

&gt;A __townland__ ([Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language): *baile fearainn*) is a small geographical division of land used in Ireland. The townland system is of [Gaelic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_Ireland) origin, pre-dating the [Norman invasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_invasion_of_Ireland),     and most have names of [Irish Gaelic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language) origin.  However, some townland names and boundaries come from [Norman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiberno-Norman) [manors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manorialism), [plantation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantations_of_Ireland) divisions, or later creations of the [Ordnance Survey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordnance_Survey_Ireland).   The total number of townlands was 60,679 in 1911.

c) The article says a great deal else, asking why Muslims don't appear to condemn that violence as vocally as other groups condemn violence perpetuated by those from their own social, religious or cultural group. You miss this point entirely.

d) Caveat: Personally, I don't agree with the point the article is trying to state, in that perpetual victimhood is the problem. This is a fallacy in my opinion, but I understand why the article writer might view it that way and I don't think it's bigotry to see things that way.

true,ScientificAlligator,null,null,"With your level of finances, I don't think you should be told how to invest by a sorry bunch like us. Instead, I think you should - almost *must* - learn for yourself and join our sorry bunch. I'd expect learning ""how to invest"" would be the most profitable use of your learn/work time. In other words, it would be more worthwhile for you to take the week off, eat out, order a house cleaning service and take a cab to wherever you want to go - and spend all that working, cooking, cleaning and driving time on reading how to invest, playing with spreadsheets and numbers. The resources are all over the Internet, including the sidebar here and at /r/financialindependence. Just don't do it tomorrow, or next week, or in 10 years, do it now. Tuition is cheaper at 27 than at 37.

You will learn very simple principles, many of them I suspect you know. One of them is that you can't afford to be unsure where your money is. Another is that you can't invest without knowing or at least estimating what are you investing for (when/where/why will you need the money). A third is how to do passive management - i.e., buying a certain mixture of assets like stocks or bonds, then *leaving them alone* for a year, then re-balance the mixture (because some assets will go up and some will go down) and leave it alone for another year. Very simple passive passive investment rules have been shown time and again to outperform active management (active means you try to buy and sell ""at the right time"", or even worse, pay someone else to do that for you; you'll fail, they'll fail and take a commission).

It shouldn't take you long to be comfortable with things like interest (and how it works for or against you), safe withdrawal rate, stocks, bonds and indices. Once you feel comfortable in these waters and have goals and a solid plan, you're more than welcome to come back here and/or to an IFA and review it. I'm not into finances myself and I can't say I figured it all out, but I feel like I learned the ropes about how to really manage my money only recently, years after you.

true,BadBoyFTW,eng-derbyshire,Derbyshire,"&gt; So by making weed more legal and more accessible, less people would try it?

In terms of 'hard' drugs. Correct.

Look at Portugal. HIV cases have decreased, and virtually all hard drug use has dropped. Also crime rates have dropped significantly. 

Crime in Colorado has dropped in double digits since legalisation.

And Cannabis use has only increased in the low single digits (in Portugal, jury it out on Colorado).

&gt;You are overlooking the uncountable percentage of people who don't use precisely because of those reasons. Look how many people drink and smoke knowing the medical implications, it's the law that stops people not the health concerns.

I just fundamentally disagree on this point. For a start Cannabis is the second most used drug in the world - so you believe it would become the number 1?

**That would actually be great for public health...** if less people drank and smoked and more people turned to weed... public health would increase overall as it is a MUCH less harmful drug.

&gt;Not all addicts but users.
&gt;Like I stated previously much of Portugal success has been put down to its extensive use of aftercare and drug rehabilitation.

So you believe there *will* be a horde of people who will suddenly become users if the penalties are removed?

And this hasn't happened on Portugal because they've put ""extensive use of aftercare and drug rehabilitation""...

So why not try the same thing here, at least? Isn't it preferable to treat and care for addicts rather than imprison them? 

Also what about the **MASSIVE** savings in law enforcement and refocusing the law? And the massive increase in taxes coming in. What about the reduction in crime? The reduction in people with criminal records and custodial sentences forcing them to the fringes of society struggling to find jobs for non-violent crimes.

There are so many arguments for legalisation (or at least decriminalisation) and virtually zero for keeping it illegal.

The current system has failed in every single count, unless you live in a fantasy world in which everyone would suddenly become hedonistic idiots if it was legal. Use has increased - despite laws getting harsher and harsher. Purity has increased despite ENORMOUS spending on customs. You can't even keep drugs out of prison for christ sake, how can you keep it off the streets?

If your aim is, even vaguely, to reduce harm then keeping it illegal is completely immoral. The only excuse is if your aim is simply a moral crusade.

Yeh I am a council tenant. I'm terrible at communicating by phone but I could get someone to help me out with reporting it. My own mental health issues have caused me to keep putting it off but now I've realised that it's not going to stop if I don't report it. I had wondered what was the most appropriate route to take (council or police).


I've only lived here for about a year and a half. Moving has it's ups and downs. I've just settled in here, have started to spend money to get the place sorted out and make it my home, I know the area, it's close to my family. The stress of having to find a new place, in an area i might be unfamiliar with, possibly having to relocate Drs, bidding on Edindex again, moving all my stuff etc all seems a bit overwhelming. I have thought about it before though!


The trouble is that I can't predict when he's going to make noise. I wouldn't want the council or police to visit while he's not making some noise as I feel that nothing will happen, like I've wasted their time.


And also if he's got mental health problems it might complicate things - it's not like I'm complaining about someone having a party in their flat every weekend (that would probably be easier to deal with). He does need an intervention and some psychiatric help. I have no idea what state of mind he's in. Will he even be able to comprehend that he's causing other people distress or is he on a completely different planet that it won't even register? 
I get really angry when he's woken me up/doing his ocd things that I'm always tempted to go and knock on his door and confront him but I don't think it's a good idea (also I don't think English is his first language so there could be a language barrier).

This morning he woke me up not long after I'd managed to drift off to sleep. He started around 3am - slamming his door and the letterbox repeatedly, moving about a lot, shouting/some sort of vocal noise that was hard to distinguish, running water for a bit. I forgot to say in my original post that he blows his nose loads which makes me wonder if he's snorting drugs or something (maybe he just has bad sinuses). I think he stopped at around 4am.

true,Snoron,cnty-england,Bradford,"This distinction is similar to the species problem and the similar language problem (""a language is a dialect with an army and a navy"" sort of thing). In fact anything that has evolved over time has similar labelling issues. There's really no clear-cut line as to when something becomes a distinct religion.

There are ""sects"" of Islam that are more similar than Catholicism and Protestantism are to each other, yet the majority of Muslims would swear that they are not real Muslims at all and instead practise a distinct (and heretical!) faith. It's all down to perspective and who you choose to listen to.

Another good example would be that Mormonism is no closer to Catholicism than Islam is to Catholicism. Yet look at which ones are both classed as ""Christian"". In this context it makes no sense at all to class .

The actual reason that Islam is seemingly more homogeneous is that Muslims are more militant in outcasting people whose beliefs differ slightly, whereas Christians for whatever reason tend to be okay with a very wide ""Christianity"" label being applied to themselves.

Unfortunately the difference is a lot more complex than semantics.

In reality it should be the divergence of belief and self-imposed importance of said beliefs within that religion that separates them.

I think there's a lot of myth and lore here.  I've really only ever ridden road bikes (or bikes with thin wheels, see below), and I do plenty of riding on things which are not roads.  There definitely are things you *can't* do: deep mud and very steep soft paths are hard, going over really rough terrain is impossible.  But if you just want to hack around on mildly-maintained foot/bike paths, they're fine.

One thing that can matter is frame geometry: a serious road bike will have a very short wheelbase, which means the front wheel will overlap the pedals and there will be minimal clearance between the back wheel and the seat tube.  Both of these can matter when riding off-road: the first can cause you to fall off when moving very slowly, the second means you can't have mudguards and crud can get trapped between the back wheel and frame.

true,blooshamoo,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt; I think we were almost certainly poorer as a nation 66 years ago than we are now

The GDP per person adjusted for inflation is about 4 times greater than 1955.


The average lifespan has increased about 12% in that time. However the range of NHS services and their complexity has increased magnitudes and most of the increased costs comes from that. Between 2001 and 2011 the NHS has spent around £850,000,000 on MRI machines, CT scanners and Linacs. All of which need trained operators, doctors trained in their usage, staff trained in maintenance and repair and actual maintenance and repair costs.

My point is: Technology has changed the world and many parts of our economy are made significantly cheaper, even free because of advanced technology. But the NHS is going to keep getting more expensive because it's not getting more streamlined, technology isn't reducing the workload, it's increasing it. And that's a good thing because we're living longer, better lives as a result. And the increased costs are a small fraction of the countries increased GDP and we should be happy about that! Our increased efficiency and productivity is giving us better lives! Society is working!

If we charge people for things retroactively it can create huge problems. The system is designed to accept moral relativism: that what is wrong today may be seen as okay tomorrow. Or vice versa.

But say society evolved tomorrow into suddenly outlawing chewing gum. It would be unfair to charge people tomorrow for what wasn't a crime today.

true,Alwaysfair,null,null,"&gt;In terms of 'hard' drugs. Correct.

I'm not talking about hard drugs. 

&gt; I just fundamentally disagree on this point. For a start Cannabis is the second most used drug in the world - so you believe it would become the number 1?

No I doubt it would become number 1 or even 2 for that matter, I should  imagine the gulf between alcohol and cannabis use is huge, but that does not mean that usage would not increase. You really can't argue that greater accessibility would not lead to greater use. 

I agree with it perhaps ceasing to be a gateway drug and other drug uses levels falling but not cannabis itself. 

&gt;That would actually be great for public health... if less people drank and smoked and more people turned to weed... public health would increase overall as it is a MUCH less harmful drug.

There are no longer term comprehensive studies on this, it is still very much a unknown. I agree that short term usage health concerns have been proven to be very mild in most cases. 

&gt;So you believe there will be a horde of people who will suddenly become users if the penalties are removed?
And this hasn't happened on Portugal because they've put ""extensive use of aftercare and drug rehabilitation""...


Correct, no doubt what so ever. There is a difference between hard drugs and cannabis,  Portugal's aftercare tackled mostly hard drugs, not cannabis users. By legalising cannabis it ceases to become a gateway drug, hence reducing the likely hood of hard drug use. Which is great, but it does not account for the increased use of cannabis, which like I stated above has it's own problems. 


&gt;Also what about the MASSIVE savings in law enforcement and refocusing the law?

If you don't police something surprisingly enough you save money, this same argument could be made for theft. Just because something is expensive to do doesn't mean we should stop doing it.

&gt;massive increase in taxes coming in. 

Taxes, no argument from me here, it would be sensible to tax it. Would tax revenue cover the potential social and medical problems, it is difficult to predict. 

&gt;What about the reduction in crime?

Again, linked to hard drugs, as you keeping stating cannabis is rarely addictive. 

&gt;The reduction in people with criminal records and custodial sentences forcing them to the fringes of society struggling to find jobs for non-violent crimes.

This is more an issues of decriminalisation, something which I very much support.

&gt;There are so many arguments for legalisation (or at least decriminalisation) and virtually zero for keeping it illegal.

Not true, nobody knows the long term implications both on society and health. 


&gt;The current system has failed in every single count, unless you live in a fantasy world in which everyone would suddenly become hedonistic idiots if it was legal. Use has increased - despite laws getting harsher and harsher. Purity has increased despite ENORMOUS spending on customs. You can't even keep drugs out of prison for christ sake, how can you keep it off the streets?

So give in? I hate this argument, your other points are valid but this is not.

The strategy described in the article is not simply ""choosing stocks"". It's choosing stocks along with both long and short options to limit downside (and upside). This is quite distinct from bonds in several important ways, the most obvious of which is correlation with equity investments.

You're swapping interest rate risk for equity market risk. One of the main purposes (the main purpose, generally) of bonds in a portfolio is to smooth returns due to the low correlation of bonds with equities, combined with rebalancing. A limited-risk equity investment as described is likely to have much higher correlation with equity markets, so even if the risk is comparable (which can't be proved) is likely not a good candidate for this job.

And then there's the fact that you can get a guaranteed (subject to counter-party risk) positive return from bonds if you hold them to maturity, which this approach can't give you because no equity is ever guaranteed to rise in price ever again.

Also there are more practical problems. Let's consider a typical investor who wants a simple strategy they can use in an ISA with minimal intervention. How are they going to use this approach (if it was a good idea)? (I supposed they could take up that limited risk product that Yorkshire Building Society just got fined by the FCA over...)

I suppose you could argue for limited risk equity investments as an alternative to bonds for what otherwise might be a whole-bond portfolio, but that's rather a special case.

Oh, and I don't give advice here. I just discuss things.

true,BadBoyFTW,eng-derbyshire,Derbyshire,"&gt;No I doubt it would become number 1 or even 2 for that matter, I should imagine the gulf between alcohol and cannabis use is huge, but that does not mean that usage would not increase. You really can't argue that greater accessibility would not lead to greater use.

&gt;I agree with it perhaps ceasing to be a gateway drug and other drug uses levels falling but not cannabis itself.

Well yes use will increase. But as I've said in existing cases it has been a very modest increase. Nothing like the flood everyone predicted.

&gt;There are no longer term comprehensive studies on this, it is still very much a unknown. I agree that short term usage health concerns have been proven to be very mild in most cases.

Simply, factually, untrue.

Cannabis **is** less harmful than Tobacco and Alcohol. This is beyond dispute.

&gt;Correct, no doubt what so ever.

It's going to be difficult/impossible to have any kind of discussion then... there is absolutely zero factual basis for this claim.

Why do you believe there is a horde of people just waiting to become Cannabis users? What is your evidence?

Mine is Portugal and MMJ states in America. Factual, scientific, empirical evidence. What is your evidence?

&gt;If you don't police something surprisingly enough you save money, this same argument could be made for theft. Just because something is expensive to do doesn't mean we should stop doing it.

[Reductio ad absurdum.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum) Textbook case.

There are no reasonable arguments I've heard for ceasing to police theft. There are plenty of compelling arguments to legalise/decriminalise drugs - even if you don't agree. Many many people do.

[A quick Google says that the War on Drugs costs the UK £16 billion a year](http://www.politics.co.uk/news/2009/4/7/the-cost-of-drug-laws-16-billion). Just removing Cannabis from this list would likely result in a couple billion saved, without even considering the benefit of things like grow houses no longer existing.

&gt;Taxes, no argument from me here, it would be sensible to tax it. Would tax revenue cover the potential social and medical problems, it is difficult to predict.

And this is where it becomes difficult to debate, because we disagree on the facts.

My point of view, supported by scientific evidence, is that almost everyone who currently wants to use drugs already do. So the social and medical problems they have already exist. It's not some magical unknown which will come into existence, it already exists. The law makes almost no difference.

With that in mind, it would most likely cover the difference with ease.

[The entire NHS budget for 2014 is just shy of £100bn](http://www.england.nhs.uk/allocations-2013-14/). I really doubt that the associated cost of legalisation in terms of medical and social would increase the cost of the NHS by more than 1 or 2%. Even that sounds pretty extreme.

So if it could save £1-2bn in policing costs, you've immediately covered any health costs. And again this ignores any and all secondary or tertiary benefits of legalisation. 

Not to mention this is assuming I'm wrong and you're right - that there is a horde of people waiting to become users overnight.

&gt;Again, linked to hard drugs, as you keeping stating cannabis is rarely addictive.

Now this is what made me want to reply.

The reduction in crime statistics are in for Colorado. All other drug laws remain untouched there.

And they are reporting over a 10% reduction in crime since legalising in comparison to the same time the previous year. That is an enormous reduction in crime. I find it hard to believe anybody could find a negative spin on this statistic.

&gt;Not true, nobody knows the long term implications both on society and health.

Thats beside the point at this stage. We have as good of an idea as we are going to get. The sky has not fallen in Colorado, Washington or Portugal, or Amsterdam.

And it has been proven, time and time again, that the damage to society is **far greater** by keeping it illegal. And in the mean time, it being illegal is having close to zero impact on use, purity or availability. The opposite in fact - all of those have increased since drugs became illegal.

&gt;So give in? I hate this argument, your other points are valid but this is not.

You've just got no counter argument, so you call it invalid.

Why is it invalid?

If you cannot keep drugs out of prisons, how can you ever hope to keep them out of countries? Even if you've got 1 policeman (guard) to every citizen (prisoner) and put every single citizen in a 2x6ft cell with a list of allowed possessions. Even if you monitor every single thing which comes in and goes out. Even if you walk around their room every couple of hours. Even if you build a 20ft wall around them. You STILL cannot keep drugs out. Isn't that a valid comparison? Certainly more valid than saying we should stop policing theft...

Equally use has increased. Availability has increased. Potency has increased. Those are three demonstrable failures of drug policy. The statistics are going in the exact opposite direction to what that £16bn a year is being spent on. We're getting less than nothing for our money.

...unless you believe there is an entire horde of people just waiting to get their hands on drugs but don't at the moment simply because they don't know a dealer or they're afraid of the punishment...",0,1404567078,null,0,1404567398,0,cip34db,t3_29tnma,t1_cip34db,t1_cip2roy,null,1434562317,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I do not know where you live, but I have not found in my experience (I live in Australia and use the public health system) that nurses are without empathy. Could it be that you could find a better standard of service elsewhere? - anyway, I will not go into that kind of thing just because I am sure you are managing that yourself and in any case have a much better understanding of your own situation; it is not like I could provide any helpful advice on this.

It might sound rich for me to say because I do not suffer from cluster headaches and have not perceived that kind of pain before, but I do not think that they are deserving of hate for that reason - it is at the very least useless to expend your energy on hating people that are attempting to do a job that is good in itself (whether they are doing it well is another matter, but if they are not then that deserves something other than hate).

Anyway, triage does involve an assessment that goes beyond the visual perception of physical pain by a nurse or doctor. However, it is certainly possible that the improper treatment of people who have not been diagnosed with this condition is a flaw with the system - as others have said, the NHS is incredible but imperfect - and if it is the case that cases like yours go undiagnosed then that is something that should absolutely be rectified. 

With that being said though, I think that the basis of the NHS, which is free healthcare at the point of use, does not conflict with your needs - there is nothing about the NHS that necessitates waiting periods but insufficient funding from mostly Tory but some Labour governments (and even that does not necessitate waiting periods, just more stringent management being necessary to mitigate waiting periods); waiting periods are not synonymous with public healthcare.",0,1404568421,null,0,false,0,cip3fuj,t3_29w2ud,t1_cip3fuj,t1_cip36z1,null,1434562534,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I agree we have upset and hurt many people, but we have helped many more.

Extremism is still growing. The invasion hasn't worked. Going into Afghanistan and Iraq has only pissed off more people and pushed them to extremism, not destroyed the Taliban or Al Qaeda. If my entire family was killed by a Western drone for no reason other than 'they might be terrorists', I would thirst for revenge. People like that see the Taliban as a way to get their revenge against the people who killed their loved ones.

You also have to realise these extremist groups have a lot more power than we'd think. In certain parts of the Middle East, girls still don't go to school.

true,QALY,null,null,"Just a slight correction, but triage does not extend beyond your local accident and emergency department.

For non-emergency treatment the NHS uses Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) to measure the value of a given medical treatment. This essentially boils down to a quasi-utilitarian cost-benefit analysis of any given treatment. 

Say you have a patient aged 58 with abdominal peritonitis. Treating her would give her 15 more years of life, which for a healthy person would give them 15 QALYS. This patient, however, has an unrelated critical illness that significantly impacts the quality of her life, so each year of her life is only worth 0.6 QALYs. The treatment would provide her with 9 QALYs at a cost for the operation of £147,000, or a cost per QALY gained ratio of £16,333/QALY.

Another patient is a male aged 26 with a particularly unusual congenital heart defect. Treating the defect would give him another 50 years of perfect health, so it's worth 50 QALYs. However, the treatment costs £250,000, yielding cost per QALY gained of £5,000/QALY. The NHS would prioritise this treatment over the 58 year old's.

Advocates of the QALY contend that it's the most effective method of allocating limited resources in a way that maximises their benefit and utility to society.

Opponents of the QALY contend that assigning lower priority to the elderly or unfit is ageist and ableist, and that it's unfair that the elderly who have paid into the system for their whole lives are given lower priority than others. The NHS have been accused of chasing ""easy QALY wins"" and concentrating it's funding on easily treatable and common conditions for otherwise perfectly healthy persons to inflate performance figures.",0,1404568831,null,0,false,0,cip3jki,t3_29w2ud,t1_cip3jki,t1_cip2u10,null,1435480857,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

Suarez and his agent could have brought in the lawyers over the Arsenal move; instead they signed a new contact with a bigger release clause. I'm not suggesting Suarez deserves a medal for loyalty there, he made a ton of money out of the salary rise and got a better move too, but the club got another season of him, time to prepare, and a lot bigger transfer fee.

&gt;Yep, but here name will still be on Google attached to all that 'negative' media.

The name issue can be overcome easily, within a day.

Deed poll... £10 if you are a cheapskate.... under £20 if you go in person to change, get next day delivery. (+ the cost of all the relevant legally required changes to passport, Drivers license etc..)

&gt;Maybe in California, but Norn Iron is so small it's a different story here.

I think the same applies any any small community, town anywhere in the world. The city is a different place. Belfast is big enough to not know who lives next door. You can go into the city center, regularly walk past thousands of people and see no one you know. PDF: [The Metropolitan area has a population of 579,276](http://www.nisra.gov.uk/archive/demography/publications/urban_rural/ur_gaz.pdf)

The issue now is... protection from abuse and negative impact by the ""outraged idiots"". yes?

It's doable in this country. May need to move to belfast, change name and slightly alter physical appearance but it's easily doable. Dublin is also not that far away, the rest of the U.K is only a few hours away too. 

  
   

    
 

  

 
The real place for ""no hope"" is....The Sun etc... will get off without any real punishment for what they have done. 

A girl sucks 24 dicks as a drunken game... how does that affect anyone? It fucking doesn't. Yet they are allowed to pedal hate and so called ""shame"" on someone who willingly done that for fun.  

Don't like people having gay sex.... Don't like people taking drugs.... Don't like a girl having promiscuous fun.... nothing to do with you. You shouldn't even be thinking about it, never mind hate it.


Changing the minds of those idiots who force their ""morality"" on people is where I have less hope. They are the ones that are a disgrace in this story. To avoid the negative impacts they create, the girl may have to move and change her name. They are sick bastards.

true,Alwaysfair,null,null,"&gt;Well yes use will increase. But as I've said in existing cases it has been a very modest increase. Nothing like the flood everyone predicted.

Give it time, it is hard to undo generations of drug persecution and illegality, look at how many people drink and smoke now, both legal both have more direct health implications.

&gt;Simply, factually, untrue.
Cannabis is less harmful than Tobacco and Alcohol. This is beyond dispute.

There are no long term comprehensive studies that I have heard of, that are perhaps based off the average smoking patterns of current users in countries which have has cannabis legalised for say 20 years. 

&gt;Correct, no doubt what so ever.
It's going to be difficult/impossible to have any kind of discussion then... there is absolutely zero factual basis for this claim.
Why do you believe there is a horde of people just waiting to become Cannabis users? What is your evidence?
Mine is Portugal and MMJ states in America. Factual, scientific, empirical evidence. What is your evidence?

I am sorry but I cannot currently concede this point, because as mentioned above there are no long term studies. We would need to do a study on users who were born post legalisation. I agree the short term shows no huge gains but that population has lived with cannabis being illegal and persecuted against for most of their lives. Can you understand the dilemma here?

There is a study that was conducted in Finland I think, where the speed limits in an region were abolished, but the majority of drivers did not move far from the previous speed limit, however new drivers with no preconceived notion of speed limits did. 


We are basing all of our assumption off a current population psyche, a psyche that has been heavily influenced.


&gt;There are no reasonable arguments I've heard for ceasing to police theft. There are plenty of compelling arguments to legalise/decriminalise drugs - even if you don't agree. Many many people do.


Probably because theft doesn't bring with it a host of other criminal problems. Let one go solve three, it's great but not right, better would be to try and stop all.

&gt;My point of view, supported by scientific evidence, is that almost everyone who currently wants to use drugs already do.

Which I have explained is a false notion, or at the very least inaccurate for long term extrapolation. 

&gt;The entire NHS budget for 2014 is just shy of £100bn. I really doubt that the associated cost of legalisation in terms of medical and social would increase the cost of the NHS by more than 1 or 2%. Even that sounds pretty extreme.

It again I think is based of the false notion of limited uptake, what if it is as popular as smoking? or even half as popular? 


&gt;The reduction in crime statistics are in for Colorado. All other drug laws remain untouched there.
And they are reporting over a 10% reduction in crime since legalising in comparison to the same time the previous year. That is an enormous reduction in crime. I find it hard to believe anybody could find a negative spin on this statistic.

Your right I can't argue with that, however I am curious as to why crime fell, a 10% reduction in crime is huge like you state, was it all down to turf wars?

&gt;Thats beside the point at this stage. We have as good of an idea as we are going to get.

It's not, it is my single biggest issue with legalisation, we don't know the long term affects.

&gt;You've just got no counter argument, so you call it invalid.

I find an enjoyable charm in the classic Who episodes, and the core idea of the Doctor is easily enough to carry the shows for me.

The later series do improve in general technique as TV production improved overall, and by the final run with #7 there are special effects that could be in the show today and still look good.

What the girl did wasn't illegal. What the bar and the men did probably was, considering she was extremely drunk and therefore could not legally consent (though I don't know if the law is the same there).

true,forgottenoldusername,eng-manchester,It is indeed grim up north.,"True, very true. But I'm not sure it's in the best interests of the Royal Navy to own a ship purely for humanitarian needs, unfortunately. After all, the navy is part of the armed forces, and the armed forces aren't just there to provide humanitarian support, far from it.

Personally I'm very much for the air craft carriers, we need to be able to project power if we are going to continue to be a world player. There is plenty of room for an argument that we should take a back seat and stop being one of the strongest naval forces on Earth, but personally I believe we should still strive to be able to project power when needed. People can say we wont need an aircraft carrier due to the current 'enemy' mostly being a poorly armed guerrilla kind of force, but air support in areas where it would otherwise be impossible can only be a good thing. And a lot can change in 50 years.
But that's a discussion for another time!

It's just a shame the government has made such a mess of it, and even more of a shame that we've spent all that money on 2 of them and now there are doubts we can even keep 2 of them.

&gt;What does it mean claiming expenses against tax? If a company paid £100 for meals. Does it mean you have now less £100 tax to pay? Or does it mean reduction is applied to taxable income?


For a basic limited company, there are four stages of ""profit"" that the business goes through when doing its accounts:

a. Turnover (sales)

b. Gross profit (sales less cost of materials)

c. Net profit before tax (gross profit less expenses, such as wages, heat light, etc.)

d. Net profit after tax (NPBT less tax paid) It is this figure that dividends can then be taken from and paid to the business owners.

With your example of a meal claimed as a business expense, this would be deducted at stage [c] above. This reduces the business's taxable profits, and therefore it pays less tax. As an easy example, imagine a business with net profits before tax of £1,000. Assuming 20% Corporation Tax, there is £200 tax due, leaving net profit after tax of £800. If I can deduct a business expense of £100, then my NPBT is £900 and I will pay tax of 180, leaving NPAT of £720. My £100 expense has therefore only actually ""cost"" £80.


&gt;What are the advantages for sole trader title over ltd company title? It seems to me that as a sole trader you're liable for everything you do and you pay 40% in taxes for everything which makes the latter choice no-brainer, is this correct?


A sole trader will pay Income Tax and National Insurance on his/her entire profits. They will have a Personal Allowance of £10,000 - so the first £10,000 of income is charged at Nil. The next £31,865 of income is taxed at 20%; the next £118,135 at 40% and anything over that is taxed at 45%. National Insurance works in a similar way and, for a Basic Rate taxpayer, is roughly 12% (however, companies also have to pay NI based on the salaries they pay their staff - more on this later). Therefore a BRT will pay IT and NI at an approximate rate of 32% on their income, ignoring Personal Allowances.

A limited company does not have a Personal Allowance and, assuming it is a small company in terms of profits earned, it pays Corporation Tax at 20% on all taxable net profits. Seems much better, doesn't it? The catch is, if you are the director (owner) of the company, how are you going to get your money out? If you pay yourself wages, the company and you have to pay NI and you will have to pay Income Tax. As salaries are a business expense, this will reduce your company's profits, but you are still paying IT and NI as you were before. It tends to work out about the same in total as for sole traders - hence why sole traders still exist.

One way around this is to pay yourself a wage which is just below the Personal Allowance, so that you pay no NI or IT. You can then take dividends from the company's net prodits after tax and, as long as you remain a Basic Rate Taxpayer, there is nothing more to pay. The company has paid 20% on all its profits, but you've saved all the National Insurance costs. You'll probably need an accountant (which increases admin costs) but it can work out extemely well in terms of saving total tax paid.


&gt;What prevents an owner of company from hiring their family members to reduce income tax?


Nothing, as long as they are actually doing a job. If you're just hiring them to pay them a salary to reduce your company's profits (and therefore its tax bill), that's called Tax Evasion. This is illegal. If HMRC catch you, you're in trouble.


&gt;If ltd company buys a car for CEO of the company, and the company goes under few years later, will the car be sold? And if there are some outstanding loans, does it mean the owner is liable for them?


The car belongs to the company, and is an asset of the business. (Despite the fact that the car would be deemed a benefit in kind, and the CEO would probably have been paying Income Tax based on its value for the benefit of having been given a ""free"" car.) If the company goes under, its assets will need to be sold to pay its liabilities, including the car.

The ""limited"" in limited company means limited liability. The company is deemed a separate legal entity and therefore its debts belong to itself and no-one else. If it folds, the company's assets are gone (including any share capital injected into the business by the owner), but the owner's personal possessions and money are safe. This is not the case with a sole trader, and is generally seen as one of the biggest advantages of using a limited company as a vehicle for a business.",0,1404582328,null,0,1404582594,0,cip820x,t3_29wo8q,t1_cip820x,t3_29wo8q,null,1435480534,8,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,8

1) What does being Brazilian have anything to do with this? We are talking about individuals here.... Since you don't like Brazilians i'll switch up and name 10 more for your ass (none are Brazilian). Mikel, Riquelme, Bojan, Freddy Adu, Alvaro Recoba, J. Dos Santos, Nani, G. Dos Santos, Pennant, and Andres D'Alessandro.

2) Everyone knows the only reason why Ronaldinho ""sucked"" was because the fame got to his head. [There was a documentary about the fame getting to his head.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8absGUSLQx4) He felt bigger than the game itself which caused all of this. That's different than you just sucking. Still at the end of they day, you can't say he ""sucked"" because he revolutionized the game and brought a whole new style to it. Winning various amounts of trophies/awards in the process. Bringing a lot of fans/income for the teams he played for. There wouldn't be as many Barca fans as we have today if it wasn't for him.

3) You just contradicted everything you previously said by saying 
&gt;""Quaresma was never the player everyone expected him to become. He was supposed to become as good as Ronaldo but never got close, so I don't know why you're even mentioning him""

Everyone expected to get better but look what happened. He didn't, the fact that he showed promise at a young age didn't mean that he would get better. So your ENTIRE argument is completely invalid now. You're just gunna pull something out your ass to make up for your idiot ass statements

4) Mutu was doping himself. So i'm PRETTY sure you can't say he was ""amazing"" if he was cheating. Mr. I follow football.

5) You saying 
&gt;Yeah no shit, he's only 25.

In response to 
&gt;Diego Costa will get BETTER at Chelsea insists Diego Simeone 

Implies that you think he will ONLY get better because he is relatively young. AKA guaranteed improvement.

6) I've debunked everything you said. Gave you MORE players that have flopped at a young age. You have no argument here. I'm not going to respond to what your going to say next, because it's probably going to be worse than the comment i'm responding to now. Stop playing FIFA, you probably suck anyways.

Additionally this scene has was roughly ten billion layers to it, but I'll name a few:

1) The ""same device, different case"" has an obvious double meaning referring to the Doctors (the warrior, the man who regrets, and the man who forgets). Same Doctor, different ""case"" both physically and emotionally. 

2) The culmination of this scene is averted, and disguised as a joke. In retrospect this is an act of genius because, most importantly...

Dembele did his job well but didn't do anything super crazy, played it too safe and that's why he was dropped, so probably didn't help his valuation. 5/10

Ricardo Rodriguez is also amazing at tackling, nearly as tall and just as muscular if not more, and can put in a much better cross. I really don't know why you would try and insinuate that Luis is some how much better than Ricardo Rodriguez because he isn't. Both played amazing seasons and both are great all round players. If they were the same age the decision to buy one of them would be pretty difficult, but the fact that one is 29 and the other is 21 gives Ricardo a clear advantage.

Luis is slightly better defensively than Rodriguez, but Ricardo is miles better in attack. You would be hard pressed to find anyone who contributed more to their team going forward then Ricardo. That coupled with the fact that he is only slightly worse in defense than the best LB in the world in defense should tell you all you need to know.

Oh, and I know you like stats (from our Willian debate) so here you go. As you can see very close defensively, but offensively its a whole other story.

Suarez is a temporary custodian of the famous red shirt and to be blunt if he wants out then fuck him because whilst players might think they are irreplaceable the only thing that matters is the shirt, as Owen and Torres found out.

true,Roranicus01,wardr,Hurt,"The classic show is definitely worth it. In my personnal opinion you have to at least watch a few classic episodes to really appreciate Doctor Who. It's very different from one era to another though and I don't recommend starting with the first doctor's run. It's dated, slower in pace and most of the mythology wasn't in the show yet. Some of his stories are great, but you have to forget what you know about the show and it's mythos. 

I'd say Tom Baker and Sylvester McCoy are the two easiest doctors to get into for fans of the new show. They both have a lot of energy and have that funny side that newer doctors have. McCoy also has a darker side that rivals Tennant's. As for Tom Baker, he's had the longuest run and set up a lot of the show's most famous elements. 

Patrick Troughton is another one that's great to watch, but a lot of his stories have missing episodes. Tomb of the Cyberman is an absolute must though. He's also Matt Smith's favorite doctor and the inspiration is fairly Obvious. 

Peter Davison seems to be hit or miss with a lot of people. His performance is a bit more subtle, but that gives the companions more room to take the spotlight. He's also Tennant's favorite doctor and if you enjoy the 10th doctor, you might enjoy his episodes too. 

Pertwee's my personnal favorite doctor but most of his run happens on Earth, with little to no time travel involved. It's different but I find the larger cast of regulars a welcome change. It's a different dynamic. 

Colin Baker is the one I would not recommend starting with. He's not bad at it and if you truly want to enjoy this doctor, check out the big finish audio dramas he's done. As for his episodes, let's just say the writing wasn't at it's best back then. 

Oh, and you can always check out McGann's TV movie. It's pretty bad but McGann himself is fun as the doctor. Like Colin, I'd recommend going towards the audios for this doctor. 

Hopefully that gives you a bit of an idea. All of this is, of course, my opinion. Some might disagree. Best thing is to check out a story or two of each of the doctors and see what you think. Just don't dive in expecting more of what you know from the new show. It was a different time and different people involved in it.

We have a government that is an asset stripping parasite. who see the juicy cancer contracts that their mates can profit from. But you wont see these companies taking up the less profitable areas, the is no money in it.

What we are going to end up with is a patchwork health system that is dictated by private profits. Its already happening.

Trusts are being driven to the wall by interest on ppi projects. Another lie sold to us back in the day.

NEw contracts being entered in to by the people running the service are so punative that should we ever decide to try and find a better deal the penalties again would risk the existence of the service.

What we have here is a corporate fascist arrangement that will ensure that our beloved NHS will pay in to the cartel of health care vultures until it collapses and that will be it. They will walk away with their pockets bulging. like many other government contractors of IT systems schools hospital and other services.

A possible counter to that: the suit could be about 500+ years old. 

Given the fact that 10 was around 900 when he wore it. 11 basically lived around 600 years (If we go by his statements in The Impossible Astronaut that he was 1103, adding 100 when he meets the War Doctor, then add 300 for his time fighting on Trenzalore. For a total of 1500 years. Which of course, the Doctor lies.)

Don't get me wrong, I could fully buy the idea that the Tardis has some kind of stasis storage system that would stop any aging of objects. But odds are in 500+ years (which is basically just under 1/3 of the Doctors life to this point) the suit would have been used and received some further wear and tear if he felt like keeping it around. Not everything we see on the show is the only time the Doctor has adventures.

As for who, we seem to be linked to Shaqiri, Huntelaar, and Markovic lately, so perhaps one (or more) of them.  Earlier we had also reportedly looked at Son and Cuadrado as well.

If I could pick and assuming Sanchez isn't available, I think I might try to get both Volland and Griezmann, plus the requisite defenders.
