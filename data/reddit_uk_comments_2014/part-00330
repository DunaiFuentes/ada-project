He just got back from a stand up tour. He doesn't need the money. I think he genuinely does care, and even if he doesn't, who gives a shit? He's literally the *only* person who is reflecting that side of public opinion in the media or establishment and I'm grateful for it 

His book launch had charitable aspects to it, and as far as celebrities go he's at least somewhat genuine 

And anyway, why exactly do you expect a comedian who spent most of his life as an unemployed heroin addict to have ""solutions""? 

How would he have ""solutions"" to deconstructing an entire political system and building it back up again from scratch?  

No single person would be able to formulate a ""solution"" to such a large problem. It's like you genuinely expect him to have come up with a brand new political system to replace democracy and capitalism have all the answers, as a *comedian* who has no (formal) education in economics or politics 

I don't expect solutions from brand. He is not here to provide the solutions. That's not his job. That's not his goal. 


You don't have a solution either, so does that mean you can't speak or criticise the system? Does it bollocks

according to....you. 

It's good to see traditional *white* 'civilised' British people can condemn people without evidence and break the democratic mandate without basis. But nothing proves the supremacy of 'British democracy' over Bangladeshi third-world despotism like removing those who don't follow the establishment line. Also considering that the establishment press and especially Labour were mobilising to turn any evidence of 'criminality' into generalised smears of the whole Rahman campaign, the fact they actually found no evidence proves how unfounded such claims were considering how hard they wanted Rahman got. That said the press doesn't need to print fact, stating the 'allegations' etc. is enough to make the assumption and corrupt the mind of their irrational persuadable readers and engender the white mock outrage.

&gt;Just because you get elected doesn't mean you can break the law

It's funny how the moralists and democrats only come out of the woodwork when it's people they politically disagree with, or those they're told to get angry about by the press. I don't remember any such collective anger at all the actual rotten boroughs in south London and millions of pounds lost to actual fraud, nor even the Tory's paid by accountancy firms, or those backed by private landlord or paid hundreds of thousands of pounds alongside being MPs, or those ministers who've made a nice couple of million from the council housing sell off, or the Royal Mail underselling organised by businesses in the city to which many politicians have connections to and hundreds of advisers have been at. But ignore all the really serious fraud and corruption that actually **costs billions** and instead attempt a witch-hunt for corruption for if it exists is minor at best, but as the governments own report suggest **no fraud or corruption existed**. They found nothing and they were certainly looking hard and hoping for something.

It's interesting whether this intimation and coup by central government will work the effect hoped for by the establishment, to make Rahman 'one of them' to follow the line and stop undermining the two-party system and especially stop mobilising non-whites to politics, things are best as they are where any non-white dissent is conducted into the Labour Party to be demobilised and ignored.",0,1415129484,null,0,false,0,clswrcs,t3_2l9q70,t1_clswrcs,t1_clsr73a,null,1426193425,-12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-12

Knee jerk reaction? The only knee jerks are those jumping on the Füherage's bandwagon. Let's look at some quotes from UKIP members shall we:

""No self-respecting small businessman with a brain in the right place would ever employ a lady of child-bearing age."" - Godfrey Bloom MEP

""I am here to represent Yorkshire women who always have dinner on the table when you get home.""
- Godfrey Bloom MEP

""Since the passage of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act, the nation has been beset by serious storms and floods. One recent one caused the worst flooding for 60 years. The Christmas floods were the worst for 127 years. Is this just global warming or is there something more serious at work?"" - David Silvester

""I just wish they would keep their ­homosexual nature and practices to ­themselves and stop trying to ram it down my throat telling me they are 'normal' when they are not."" - Douglas Denny

""We seek an amicable divorce from the European Union and its replacement with a genuine free-trade agreement, which is what my parents' generation thought we’d signed up for in the first place."" - Nigel Farage ~ UKIP news, issue 56

""Rather than bring peace and harmony, the EU will cause insurgency and violence."" - Nigel Farage

CeraVe Moisturizing Cream:  5.0-6.0

I have a question that you can maybe help me with... I'm trying to learn more about what pH and % is effective for which ingredient. I found a list of the pH necessary for actives in /r/DIYBeauty but I can't easily find percentages. I might not be looking in the right places. 

Here's what I know:

For vit c - it needs to be at least 10% to be effective but you may need to start lower to get your skin accustomed to it. 20% max is what I think I read somewhere. It tends to irritate skin past 20%.

For niacinamide - I'm seeing 4% in most places but I've also seen 5-10% in a few

For BHA - I've been told that 2% is good for daily use. 

AHA - 8-10% for daily use. I just bought the 10% weekly resurfacing AHA from Paula's Choice. Does this mean that once I'm used to it I can use it daily despite it saying weekly on the label?

What is a good percentage for a retinoid? Is it just the higher (that your skin can tolerate), the better?

[A yacht's keel,](http://i.imgur.com/A7rmsxA.jpg) for example, is a weight placed further from the centre of gravity in order to provide extra leverage. This prevents keelboats from capsizing, as [unballasted  dinghies can,](http://i.imgur.com/6215X2D.jpg) when tilted over too much by the wind in their sails. 

Freighters are designed to be stable at sea when they're fully laden with goods, and if they're under-laden they'll be too light and tossed around by heavy seas. 

I think at this time in the war ships were coming from the US full of goods to help with the war effort (I think the presenter mentions the [lend-lease programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lend-Lease)) and were correctly laden on the way over here.

Presumably the ships were going back empty from Bristol to New York, which is why they required [ballast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballast) (a word he does use in the video, but doesn't explain) to sit their hulls at the right depth to provide stability.

So they used rocks and stuff - the walls of war-demolished buildings - as ballast, and when they got to New York, the ballast was just junk and they just dumped it.

Common decency? Respect for the people that voted their MP in? Full coverage of views and perspectives?

&gt; Why should George Galloway and RESPECT participate when they're not standing in enough seats to win a majority?

Capoue is in for Stambouli because he's hit a patch of bad form and playing some weaker opposition may help him. Stambouli gets to start on Sunday.

Lamela and Eriksen usually take up each other's space so playing them on opposite wings to see if that helps. Get at least one off by 60' to play at the weekend.

The Doctor is terrible at saying goodbye; I could easily see him as a young man responding to the Master's growing instability by just disappearing one day. Which probably didn't do the Master's dubious mental health any favors.

If the Master is the Doctor's crazy ex whom he abandoned suddenly, that could explain a *lot.* Why the Master keeps following him. Why the Doctor feels a sense of responsibility for the Master. Why the Master is so intensely jealous of the earth girls the Doctor spends so much time with.

By vitamin C you presumably mean the L-ascorbic acid form? Percentages between 10% and 20% as you say. Don't bother with lower than 10% because you will still need a (potentially irritating) low-ish pH for it to penetrate. If you are sensitive either apply your serum every other or every third day or try a non acid form (magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, ascorbic acid-2-glucoside, even oil soluble tetra-C). Once skin is saturated L-AA remains in the skin for several days

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11207686

Niacinamide published research is 2% to 5% IIRC, if you want more efficacy try synergistic actives like N-acetyl glucosamine.

http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/wiki/ingredients/niacinamide

Yes 2% salicylic acid.

AHAs it really depends. A low percentage of lactic acid (3%?) has been shown to increase ceramide synthesis and is moisturising, you will need higher for noticeable exfoliation. The skin tends to get accustomed to AHAs after many weeks of daily use so you could take a break and lose your tolerance, cycle onto a different exfoliant (BHA or enzyme) or increase the percentage.

The research on increased photosensitivity uses 10% glycolic acid so by that point you should be vigilant with sunscreen including reapplication. If you are wearing make up and that is impractical, don't go as high as 10% IMO. Effects last a week after ceasing use.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551

Retinoids: again depends what you are trying to achieve, there is a huge range of efficacy. PocketDerm would have you using the highest percentage of a prescription retinoid that you can tolerate for anti ageing, to achieve this they are not advocating either L-AA (they use MAP) nor AHAs.

Stuff on cosmetic retinoids in linky below. *Encapsulated* retinol seems to be really gentle and apparently 'slow releases' over up to eight hours, I am using 1.5% daily without visible irritation and I am at risk of eczema (currently inactive)/ have mild rosacea. I am pretty conservative on acids tho as my skin hates being over exfoliated.

&gt;Because teachers do more than stand at the front of a classroom and talk to students about English, maths and science. We are instrumental in the development of their lives for up to seven years at a time.

You're paid to perform a job: Educate children from a curriculum that your school wants to adhere to. You've chosen to teach in a Catholic school; predominately attended by, one would assume, children from a Catholic background, with a Catholic ethos. What happens when Mr / Mrs GayTeacher comes out, the kids ask another teacher and are hit with a Catholic Morals sermon? Suddenly your position, it could be argued, is untenable. Not from a ""We'll sack them"" POV, but because you will have had another member of staff admonish you, for want of a better phrase.

&gt;Because many of my students come from countries where I would be imprisoned, and they still have those beliefs. **I have the opportunity to eradicate those beliefs.**

You shouldn't be teaching, if you think it your moral mission to eradicate peoples rights. I abhore discrimination against anyone, for any reason, but I don't run around with others in the GUILTBAG community screaming for the eradication of certain rights.

You're supposed to teach children to think for themselves. Teach them to question their beliefs, not attempt to quash them outright.

&gt;Because many of my students are likely to be gay - and will not know a single gay person in their life.

Statistically, one in ten / one in twelve of your students are likely to be gay. Also, it's 2014, not 1984.

&gt;Because it is the job of a school to prepare students for adult life - and they will encounter gay people.

And in said adult life they will likely encounter gay people who go about their lives in the same manner as heterosexual people. The only gay people I know who blather on about it are paid up QUILTBAG activists who spend more time arguing about how many more bloody letters to fit into the acronym, than actually you know, getting on with life.

More that over time society gets more 'liberal' - and this process is inevitably opposed by conservatives (small c) but then eventually it becomes normalised. You can see this process all through the last century or so: extending the franchise to all men, then women, racial equality, tolerance of homosexuality being just four of the high points. Recently gay marriage was the bleeding edge but I think we've now gone past the tipping point on that one. The point is we've actually seen some of these changes take place even within our lifetimes.

If I was feeling particularly uncharitable I could characterise the history of conservatism (again, small c) as one of being flatly wrong about nearly every important social change for 200 years. Fighting a desperate and futile rearguard action against modernity. And each time conveniently forgetting about being on the wrong side the past when the next new 'dangerous radical un British'  thing comes along - which is why I like to use the Chartists as an example.

IS had demonstrated long before they murdered Henning that they were, well, evil. They'd committed mass murder, ethnic cleansing, mass rape and sold people into slavery. Indeed, they'd also beheaded Western hostages before Henning. All of this was widely known and condemned long before Henning's brutal murder. 

I would have hoped that their actions before they killed Henning would have been enough convince anyone that they were wrong.

The Grauniad hardly dominates the world of online news. It's the UK-based general news site which attracts the greatest number of hits - discounting the Daily Mail, because, er, it's the Daily Mail and therefore doesn't count. These hits include huge number of global readers, though, and few advertisers want to pay more than commodity rates to target ""progressives"" worldwide. Comparing its global readers with other global (mainly US) general news brands it looks poor, comparing its UK readers with other UK news sites it loses credibility bcause its readers aren't signed in or paying for their content. Given that there's a vast industry which reckons the worth and reach of media vehicles, adducing similarweb.com as evidence of the Guardian's leadership is a bit dodgy. And why is it any worse to be funded by hypothecated taxation than to be funded by flogging off the Manchester Evening News and Autotrader, only to stick the loot in the Cayman Islands? 

Then, this point: *The frustration here is that search, apps and HTTPS traffic all represent different types of readers arriving at The Guardian for different reasons — and not knowing that data hurts the Guardian's ability to serve those readers relevant content.*

Well, diddums. Readers can find relevant content perfectly well by searching for it and clicking on it. If you mean ""it hurts the Guardian's ability to give away free content and still try to flog ads"", then that's a rather different argument. I don't think I have a moral obligation to a bunch of poorly-dressed Fabians in Kings Cross who have chosen an odd business model for publishing, though, just by virtue of reading their content, so I won't lose sleep over it. 

So what is Business Insider doing with this extraordinary shilling for the Guardian's beleagured digital team?

If you are, the back light from the device will be messing up your brain's cues for sleep, leading to the exhausted feeling you're reporting. Don't use your bedroom for anything other than sleeping (and shagging) - I've found that even reading a paper book messes me up a bit, since my brain thinks ""bed = sleep"", and forcing it to be active in taking in the information from the book means it can't wind down properly and prepare for sleep.

Additionally, your 8.5 hours of sleep a night seems quite a lot. Have you heard of the 90-minute rule? Supposedly the typical sleep cycle last around 90 minutes, and waking up in the middle of a cycle is the culprit for feeling groggy, listless and worn out during the day. By timing your sleep to a multiple of 90 minutes, you can wake up between cycles to feel the maximum benefit of your rest. [Sleepyti.me](http://sleepyti.me/) lets you work out when to go to sleep or when to wake up in order to get the right length of sleep. I have tried to stick to this for the last couple of years and I've actually found that I'm most alert and refreshed if I get exactly 6 hours of sleep - it sounds too little, but it works for me.

As for feeling unsatisfied with your routine, make sure you either do what you love for work, or you do things you love during your own time. It can be one or both, but not neither.

Atleast a couple hundred deposits will be returned.

Their national poll rating is quite good, the problem is that it's evenly spread out, this will probably net them enough votes to keep a lot of deposits but not enough to win many seats.

I expect somewhere between 8-15 seats after the GE for UKIP. Despite this, I think they have a good chance at getting the third highest vote share.

Hopefully UKIP will use this to push for PR hard, using the unrepresentative results as proof that FPTP is not working for Britain.

UKIP can even do a whole ""the establishment wants FPTP to keep us out!"" spin on it.

Did you know that Farage offered to campaign for AV in the referendum on it, but the AV campaign heads refused to let him get involved?

Kolo has possibly been our best player (Wut). Very little has gotten past him.

Markovic is his usual so far, lots of running with no real end product.

Lallana has struggled a bit. They're on his heels every time he gets it.

I actually had to look up our starting 11 to see our striker, because Borini hasn't done ANYTHING. Literally barely even touched the ball. When were in their final third it's Markovic, Lallana, Moreno and Manquillo with the ball. Not Borini.

&gt;__Magennis__, also spelled __Maguiness, Maginnis, McGuinness__ or __[Guinness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinness_family)__, is an [Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people) [surname](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_name), derived from the [Gaelic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language) *Mac Aonghusa*, meaning the ""descendants of Angus"", which in eastern Ulster was commonly pronounced as *Mag Aonghusa*. A prominent branch of the *[Uíbh Eachach Cobha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U%C3%ADbh_Eachach_Cobha)*, the Magennises would become chiefs of the territory of [Iveagh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iveagh), which by the 16th century comprised over half of modern [County Down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Down), [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland). By the end of the 17th century, their territory had been divided up between them and British prospectors.

Indeed there are many documented cases of attempted treatments misfiring and re offending rates increasing in response to 'rehabilitation' as the psychopath learns better how to manipulate people. 

Psychopathy is part of a spectrum of personality disorders, including Borderline Personality Disorder and malignant narcissism that are considered pathological and untreatable. They aren't like an illness that you can treat or cure, they're part of who a person is, you can't change it any more than you can change their gender identity. You can't get them to see the world through a normal moral lens any more than you can teach a colour blind person to see full colours.

Their brains simply do not have the capacity. 

This is why people in abusive relationships with these types of people are advised to just leave, they're not a 'project' to be fixed, they are what they are and the best anyone can do is to keep them from causing too much harm to themselves and others.

Not now, there's not. Thankfully. The government stepped in because people were getting fleeced. Before that, the only way you could get healthcare coverage in the US outside of a job providing one was to pay a company premiums for coverage. 

There was no intervention by a government to say how much they could charge or what minimum service had to be offered (hence [people complaining for political reasons that they couldn't keep their existing plan, even though those plans were proven to be junk ones designed to scam the public](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/11/obamacare-canceled-health-insurance)), the number of companies meant no price-setting monopoly, and there was no other authority dictating it. 

A transaction between consumer and seller, free from any intervention by a government, price-setting monopoly, or other authority ...why, isn't that the description of the free market?

Because it failed as a model of the free market and as a healthcare provider. Number one in the world in costs to people, 37th in the world in ensuring the health of the country's population, and ""coverage"" set up to take people's premiums but provide subpar coverage.

And what is his role exactly? To be an iron wall for us in defense? Because he hasn't exactly been helping us close down games. He isn't anywhere near the best defensive midfielder Chelsea could get.

And as shown by his many performances with us he is not only an extremely limited player but doesn't even do the one thing he is supposed to do very well.

Mikel is a sad story of someone who had the potential to become one of the brightest attacking midfielders but then was pushed into a defensive midfielder purely because of his physical ability. He is nothing more than a average defensive midfielder, you are absolutely kidding yourself if you think he is anything more than that or irreplaceable like you are suggesting.

The only reasons he should stay is because he has been with us for a long time and while there are upgrades available none are soo much better or younger to be worth offloading him yet. But if an amazing (relatively) young defensive midfielder becomes available to us, you can bet Chelsea and Mourinho would offload Mikel in an instant.

For example, ""Don't get a job in a CoE school if you're gay"" would be replied by DM people with the phrase mentioned before. It's unnecessary because you know it's illegal for them to fire you for being gay, so you have nothing to worry about except perhaps legal headache but you'll win in the end.

Pension is part of auto enrolment barebones deal. I pay in 0.8% and get BR tax relief. Employer pays in 1%. Been in for the last 6 months. 

It's with Legal &amp; General in a fund which over time rebalances from high equities low bonds to the reverse as I get closer to retirement. 

The charges L&amp;G have weren't as high as I thought they would be though I forget the exact figure I want to say it's around 0.7%.

My stock and shares ISA was opened last December and based on market value is about £3500. It's with Charles Stanley Direct and is in Vanguard lifestrategy 80% fund. The mini crash last month has already been eliminated as it's value is the highest it's ever been as a percentage. 

I've no idea of the goal of the ISA, maybe it's the start of a ""pension with flexibility"", maybe it's just a place to park some cash for a few years, maybe it's part of a deposit on a first property in London to live in (need someone to buy with first!) or outside of London as a BTL. Maybe in a few years time I'll transfer it into a pension although SIPPs seem far too expensive. 

Consequently, I don't know if I'll need it in the short term or long term so I've kept most of my savings in premium bonds in case I do need it in the short term as Vanguard 80% for the bulk of my savings plus with a potential short term need is too volatile for me. 

The premium bonds add up to £20,500, so my actual investments only make up a small percentage of my total savings. I'm really tempted by a BTL despite the risks it entails hence one reason why I've kept so much as cash or cash equivalent savings.

You're using a personal distaste for homosexuality in order to impose your world view onto other people who have nothing to do with you.

false,domalino,logo,,"Milner isn't that great, and he's not underplayed or underrated.

He's our Park Ji Sung. Really important to the squad, a more than good enough rotation player, and the fact his work rate is so high makes him very good at playing _some games_. But he isn't good enough to be in the starting XI. 

The reason so many people, particularly in this sub, think he is underrated by Pellegrini and Mancini before him  is because we only see him play games that suit him perfectly. A big game that we aren't clear favourites for comes along and Pellegrini puts him in. So he plays and does his job, and he runs all night, tracks back, puts in a shift perfectly and that makes people think, ""why not play him every week?"" And there's a thread saying ""More Milner minutes!"". 

Truth is when given a long stretch in the team, his performances tail off because he can't create, he's not fast enough to stretch defences, and he doesn't score. So when faced with a team which concedes possession to us, or one set up to counter he becomes almost useless on the pitch. 

The fact he has been playing so much says more about his contract negotiations and the general jaded performances in the squad, then it does about his quality. 

Having said all that, I want to point out that I really like James Milner. I think he is a very useful squad player for any CL team, and that every great team needs an engine or workhorse who will run and hustle and bustle all night. On top of that he can cover several positions, and is a great presence in the dressing room - things like learning Spanish to help the Argentine and Spanish players settle in. 

He's a key player in the squad, but he's not a first team player, and as soon as he extends his contract he will go back to being a rotation player and we will see Nasri used to break down teams camped in their box, and Navas used on teams playing a high line.

&gt; You want to know people's salaries in order to get your client the best deal

Yes and no. 

Yes - because I know what my client will realistically pay and if you're about to tell me that you're on £10,000 *more* then I'll want to know why you'd consider a drop in salary or how that all works. I've had my share of people say 'oh, I just thought maybe they could pay a bit more so I'd take a chance with it'. I don't need my time wasted like that - neither does my client. 

No - because my commission is based on the salary you get. The higher your salary, the better my commission based on a percentage. If you want to talk numbers - getting you the best deal is entirely in my interest. 

&gt; or more likely yourself a best deal. 

As above - I get the best deal by getting my job seekers the best deal. But there's a difference between that and wasting everyone's time with a job application that is someone 'taking a chance' or 'assuming they could afford more than was advertised'.

I can understand why you'd want to clarify that with your colleagues, but the students are different. Your sexual and religious identity should be left outside of the classroom. (I know that's a bit contradictory being a Catholic school, but those shouldn't exist.)

Think of your students as customers, rather than colleagues. If you worked in a shop, you'd meet many people everyday -- you don't need to know if they are straight or gay, because it doesn't matter. It's not an appropriate context to know, and that's also an important lesson for kids -- that challenging somebody on their sexual, religious or other identity is acceptable only in certain contexts.

By realz you mean realz realz? Like a Uni? Or self-studying? Both are cool. I wish I had better options, so I could do an Advanced Fiction writing or something along with Engineering.

As for books, lets see. I've been real busy so I haven't read much.

1. Outlander #1 - It took me a while to get into it, couldn't quite burst to my actual speed because of all the scottish slang in it and what not. Once I got accustomed to it, it was unexpectedly gripping though I **hated** the 'sex' scenes. I almost wanted to stop reading. Like author, I get it, those two people are having sex but can you please stop making it so cringe-worthy.

2. Gardens of the Moon - It's a book that reddit loves. Gave up about 100-200 pages in. I may get back into it later but eh.

3. Looking for Alaska by John Green - actually read it a few months back but just came to mind. Terrible, 'feelsporn' type book where the author is making shit happen just so you can feel sad. Would not recommend to a mature reader.

4. The Farseer Trilogy by Robin Hobb - loved the three books right up to the final ending. Very rushed but worth a read.

5. The Blue Sword by Robin McKinley - Someone recommended it to me when I wanted to read something with a romantic sub-plot. Waste of my time, just a chick ogling over some Prince Charming type dude while being a rebel at heart. You know, typical bullshit.

This month I've become very critical of books after my favorite YA author betrayed me by writing the worst book of all time.

Blood of Olympus by Rick Riordan - 9 almost amazing books before this and the 10th one comes across as a thrift store copy. Fuckin' hell.

Maybe because I didn’t expect much coming out of the match due to a variety of reasons (previous match performances, formations used during matches, etc.) but watching this match didn’t give me that sense of dire resignation.

From the get go, the way the defense was able to stymie Real’s attack and the midfield were able to retain possession and get the ball up the field was refreshing. The end product needed work, but I was overall happy with what I saw throughout the match.

Hopefully the players and Rodgers can build off of this and bring about more positive changes in future matches.

Personal highlights

* Mignolet doing a phenomenal job in the box

* The team playing good positive possession football and getting the ball up the field

* Markovic’s solo run up the field

* Lallana’s quick turn and shot that was a yard or so off target

* Holding Real Madrid to 1 goal at the Bernabeu, especially not letting Ronaldo get a goal.

I declined the invitation as politely as I could, stating that I could not attend. I didn't mention a single Qur'an verse, I didn't denounce her lifestyle or decision, I didn't even really go into too much detail at all, but just politely declined, and yet many took it upon themselves to heap abuse on me, to denounce me as a fanatic, to call me and my faith every name under the sun, even when I was not especially making it out to be a religious objection.

Unfortunately, much of what is said about this appears to be fan theory. (If anyone can source interesting claims about them, I'd love to see them.)

Something like a standard account goes like this: The Eye of Harmony is a collapsed star (created by Omega) and is the source of power for all Time Lord temporal technology. With this power, they created the Web of Time, something they impose onto time to keep things orderly and according to their will. The Transduction Barrier protects Gallifrey from all those who would enter physically (and perhaps temporally). And upon becoming masters of time, the Time Lords took Gallifrey out of normal time and space, it now running according to its own Inner Time, which Time Lords synchronize to.

The only parts of the story I can source offhand is the history of the Eye of Harmony and that the Transduction Barrier offers physical protection. Whether it really helps temporally, I can't say. I've seen the Web of Time come up in episodes, but I don't remember much detail about what they do with it. And the Inner Time thing... your guess is as good as mine.

Toure and Skrtel were really solid, except 1 mistake, and were always there in time. I geniually admit that I underestimated Kolo - Kudos to him for such an exceptional performance. Our spanish fullbacks were ok, made some runs later on and did a fairly good job defensive wise.

Emre Can and Lucas did a solid job keeping the midfield tight and gave Madrid as less room as possible - especially Can played really solid today despite being new to the team. 

Of course we did not have any real attacking threats but Borini and Markovic worked their asses off. I can still remember Lazars run around the 60 minute mark - that's the Lazar we want to see, please more of that !

http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/23d8qr/eli5_why_are_jews_treated_more_like_a_race_than/cgvx83p

&gt;Jews were treated like a race because, for centuries, they behaved like a race and were treated like a race. Let me explain. The answer is genetic and has to do with the fact that most Jews originated from one and the same relatively small number of Jews who lived in Israel two-thousand years ago.
For a long time this was mere conjecture but genetic testing now demonstrates this beyond a doubt: an American Jew shares a greater genetic pool with an Ethiopian Jew than they do with their non-Jewish countrymen and this common genetic pool is about two millennia old. Now, obviously, everyone on earth traces their ancestry to some group that lived somewhere 2000 years ago. The difference is that Jews, for religious reasons, remained relatively strict about intermarriage. A variety of rules (such as kosher diet or sabbath observance) kept them together as a closely-knit community, even when they were dispersed from Israel (in what Jews call ""the Diaspora""). So unlike, say, Goths or Huns, who shared the same group of origin but were ""mixed in"" thoroughly with the surrounding population in the centuries that followed their dispersal, Jews even in exile maintained a relatively ""closed"" genetic circle that is still detectable. Some outsiders have joined this group (hence, blonde Jews here and dark skinned Jews there) but that number is very small and intermarriage was, until recently, very small, in part due to exclusiveness (by Jews towards outsiders) and racism (by outsiders towards Jews). Hence: Jews are treated like a race because, for centuries, they were treated like a race.",0,1415137176,null,0,false,0,clt18z7,t3_2lapr8,t1_clt18z7,t1_clt11g7,null,1426191212,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

&gt; Yes, other people did bad things too, but that doesn't mean we didn't do bad things on a large scale.

For the most part, where the British Empire engaged in violence it imposed peace on already warring peoples, albeit through the use of often times severe violence. But overwhelming force is the best strategy in war to keep the conflict brief and minimise suffering.

&gt; There might be that argument, but that doesn't negate the complexity of the issue.

The issue needn't be more complex than the sum of the harm done by the British Empire subtracted by the sum of the good. Of course, such matters remain to some degree subjective but the present day comparisons of neighbouring nations that did and did not become part of the British Empire indicate that regardless of how complex the question may seem the results are almost invariably that the former Imperial colonies are better off than those that were colonised by other nations or not colonised at all.",0,1415137182,null,0,false,0,clt193a,t3_2lab0e,t1_clt193a,t1_clsx6js,null,1426191211,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Although they are clearly a minority of cases, its something to consider. What impacts does gay marriage have on our society and that issue? 

I'm not saying that is fully the case, but it's good to look at the whole issue and see what the impact could be. I support gay marriage, but not because I'm blindly liberal, I just think it's a good step for society to take. It seems like today, many people in my age group and beyond seem to take the view that being liberal is the only way to be. I know many of my friends would never vote conservative, and I imagine they still wouldn't if the conservative manifesto was to change to support a more equal society in someway.

You are looking at it wrong; the wind farms supplement the more traditional power stations when the winds are high and not the other way around.

Inevitably there will be times when wind turbines don't produce enough electricity, but there are also times when they produce way too much; meaning the power can be then sold on to other countries (Denmark already do this, for when Germany's onshore installations are not generating much power). 

The problem we have now is that our capacity in the UK isn't big enough, so even when there is an excess, it barely scratches the surface of our energy needs. As many against wind power keep telling us, it wasn't windy in september therefore this is justification to scrap all investment in wind energy and abandon it as a concept (Which is completely ridiculous). We only have a very small capacity, most of it being onshore where the winds are not as consistent or predictable as they are at offshore installations. This is something that the UK is expanding (Due to more than double our capacity by 2018), and here are a few examples: [(1)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_Bank) [(2)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dudgeon_Offshore_Wind_Farm) [(3)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rampion_Wind_Farm) [(4)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogger_Bank_Wind_Farm) [(5)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatrice_Wind_Farm).",0,1415137363,null,0,1415142897,0,clt1d6k,t3_2l95i3,t1_clt1d6k,t1_clsljnt,null,1426191157,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

It's hard to say what the market would look like without government intervention; I don't know what the statistics would look like if there weren't these involvements. There probably would still be people going bankrupt.

All I am saying is this: you cannot cite numbers from the US and then try to apply them to an argument about the free market. It is not a free market. Get it? So that is one huge portion of your post refuted. 

&gt;I see your response elsewhere was ""So what? The poorest of the poor now are living in relative luxury. All hail capitalism."" 

This statement is verifiably true. I don't see how anyone could find fault with it: we are living like kings, even the poorest of us, compared with our great (great) grandparents.

Let's face it: when someone claims to have watched a doc. on the US healthcare system, it's almost always Sicko.

The highlights for me were:

- Markovic showing why so many people rate him highly. He finally got to show a little cameo of his impressive speed and footwork. He lost a bit of his edge when two players started closing him down, but that run through the middle was exceptional. 

- Lallana proving all the naysayers wrong. Every time he got the ball you had the feeling he could create something -- and that's what you need from your midfielders.

I highly recommend *Midnight's Children*. Quite dense, I took a month to finish it because I found myself having to pause every few chapters to digest everything, but it was *well* worth it. And it was a great exercise in slow reading; I actually enjoyed taking so much time over it.

*If on a Winter's Night a Traveller* is one of the shorter popular meta-fiction books. It's written in the first person, and begins by describing the reader, you, preparing to read *If on a Winter's Night a Traveller*. And then it just keeps beginning, and beginning, and beginning, tantalising you with clichéd and melodramatic but wholly fascinating openings that never come to fruition.

It's like saying I can go up to a stranger and call them a f***** and then get angry when they don't take my meaning as ""a bundle of sticks"" (that analogy may not be perfect, so please don't focus on that ).

Fazio and Chiriches haven't exactly shone in the matches they've had, can't exactly blame Poch for dropping Kaboul for someone who's been playing poorly.  Capoue, except for just recently, had performed excellently in the league.  Lamela has by far the most assists in the squad, and was just dropped this past week after a couple poor showings.

The team defended as a unit for the first time that I've seen in quite some time.  Everyone had an idea of where their teammates were and where the danger was coming from the opposition, and what their responsibilities were.  There was a real discipline I haven't seen before that you usually would associate with a Mourinho side.

We lacked a real attacking edge, but I'd say that was by design.  Borini was playing alone.  Every once in a while Lallana, Markovic, or Allen would join the attack, but most of the game they focused on defense.  We did have a few opportunities where we could have equaled but it didn't happen.

I'd like for us to have this sort of strategy available to use in the premier league, and I'm hoping that was what BR intended this game for.  Kind of an experiment for this sort of play.  We need to be able to have periods of the game where we play organized, soak up pressure, and then are able to keep the ball once we've won it back, rather than giving it away cheaply by pushing to quickly counter every time.

The success we had last year with blowing away teams with this unexpected level of pressure has unfortunately seared itself on the minds of our players where there is the frantic quality to the way we play at times, and we give the ball away cheaply looking for a quick counter-attacking goal.  I still want that to be part of repertoire as well, but I think it requires a faster striker up top than Balotelli to be successful.  And I don't think we can sustain the pressure for a full 90.  In the past it didn't matter because we could consistently get more goals than we gave up.  We need to be bit more intelligent now, in turning this style of play for periods of the game, and then having periods where we are content to play much slower.

We have so many young players that we are relying on.  And they've mostly seen us succeed in a very singular way of playing.  BR needs them all to start having an understanding with each other about other ways to play.  I'd be happy if BR would occasionally play for the 1-0 victory, especially against bigger sides away from home.

Then a couple of days later I got an email to tell me I'd got the job, with a date for my induction. I ignored it, assuming it was sent to me by mistake, but then a week later I got another one with a new induction date, telling me that the job offer would be rescinded if I didn't turn up this time.

As for current job things: I had a really shit day at work yesterday (read: I was in a foul mood for no obvious reason and everything was winding me up) and loudly proclaimed to the supervisor and assistant manager that I'd ""had enough of this fucking shithole"" and that I'd be out of there as soon as I can find a job that doesn't involve dealing with the public face-to-face.

So... yeah, in an ideal world I'd like to go back to working in admin. Or at least something office based, with predictable hours, that doesn't involve too much public interaction. Like what I used to do when I worked for the NHS. Problem is, thanks to university and a spell of unemployment, I've been out of that line of work for over 8 years and everywhere seems to require recent relevant experience.

However, when it comes down to it, it's unlikely that there's any party you'll agree with completely (especially in our 3-5 party system...). The fact is that, were you to vote Green, there would be countless other Green voters who agree with you- I stick with the party in the hope that one day they'll see sense on the nuclear issues etc.- and the best way to change that is to get most members of the party to support nuclear power! It seems that on social/economic issues you agree with the party's policies, and that's what really matters.

In any case, if you look at somewhere like Sweden, one of the only countries to commit to closing its nuclear stations (though it's now gone back on that), they held a referendum on the issue due to its importance- and if the Greens got anywhere on that issue, there's no way the other parties would agree to abolishing nuclear without a referendum. That goes for animal testing as well. As for the alternative medicine thing, the official line is that all medicine should be supported by scientific evidence, so nothing to worry about there.

Overall, I'd strongly encourage you to at the very least vote Green, but please consider joining!

* GUS turns out to be the Celestial Toymaker/Crystal Guardian and ends up becoming the main villain in Series 9. The Mummy was a long tried plan to take over and/or kill the Doctor. Eventually this also draws back the Black Guardian into the universe causing no end of grief for the Doctor

* Over the course of the Series 10 arc, the Doctor experiences many adventures of curious unexplained temporal complexity (including an off screen multi-Doctor story which gets referenced a few times). Eventually the TARDIS breaks down and the Doctor finds it to be the source of the temporal problems. 

 The Doctor is meanwhile called back to Earth by Kate Stewart. It turns out monsters and UNIT/Army Divisions from multiple invasions throughout Earth's history keep appearing in clumps (Cybermen from The Invasion, Autons from Terror of the Autons, Daleks from The Dalek Invasion of Earth and Remembrance of the Daleks, etc.)

 The Doctor tracks the source of TARDIS manipulation to outside the universe and eventually comes face to face with Omega who had been trying to unravel the Web of Time using the Doctor's TARDIS so he could rewrite it for his own purposes.

* (Unfortunately my next idea would no longer work with the current reintroduction of the Master) 

 After the events of Series 10 the Twelfth Doctor is able to rediscover Gallifrey (which had experienced time passing) in Series 11 due to Omega's involvement with the TARDIS. There he finds the Master as Castellan, as well as, a conspiracy to assassinate the Lord President a la The Deadly Assassin which seems to have all the hallmarks of the Master around it. But when he stops the plot, he finds no link back to the Master who swears he has gone straight. 

 The Doctor however is unable to believe the Master and once again turns renegade. Gallifrey has reintroduced a relatively strict non-interventionist policy so the Master dispatches Celestial Intervention Agents to retrieve the Doctor and any remaining renegades. The Master in this case would be an antagonist but not a villain. Slowly as the Master grew more desperate to capture the Doctor he would start sinking back into villainy. This would possibly also force the Doctor to occasionally team up with his fellow renegades to remain free. Or he could plot a way to capture the Rani or the Monk while trying to remain free.

* Series 12 would be Capaldi's last and find the Twelfth Doctor unknowingly meeting the next Doctor early on in the series. This is someone who he had wanted to be a companion, but who declined the offer. In a mid series two parter the Doctor is actually killed in a cliffhanger sacrifice to prevent a new Time War when the Daleks discover that the Time Lords have returned (the Doctor unfortunately finds himself responsible for this).

On the one hand you make perfectly valid points, but I do think you're deliberately underselling him a bit.

""runs all night"", ""tracks back"", ""puts in a shift"", ""engine"", ""workhorse"", ""hustle and bustle"" - these all represent the wider narrative around Milner, but the wider narrative (as far as I'm concerned) is unfair.  He's not the paciest but he's got tricks up his sleeve and has ways of beating his man.  

His versatility often sees him labelled as a ""Jack of all trades, master of none"", but I think that undersells the level of intelligence required to do what he does.  This isn't a pub league where everyone just sort of deals with what's directly in front of them - he's playing at the highest levels of game where anything less than an excellent understanding of your role will be ruthlessly exploited.  You can drop him near enough anywhere on the pitch and he will play *well*, not ""okayish, I suppose"", he legitimately plays *well*.

So no, he doesn't have the pace of Navas, the vision of Silva, or what have you, and when everyone is fit and the top of their game I agree, Milner is going to find himself on the bench, but he really is an extremely talented player and it winds me up a bit when all the praise he gets is *he runs a lot*.

I'd like Torchwood to come back and  I'd love a series just about River and her adventures when she's not with The Doctor.

I would cut all that out for a while. NO traditional bad guys, or at least not the ones we haven't seen half a dozen times since the reboot. It's a big universe out there but this past season I feel like we've seen more of the Tardis interior and Clara's life than we have of anything else. I'm utterly bored. I even took a little break and it just did not really matter. The moment I sat down to catch up with the episodes I'd just saved I felt the same way. 

I have this vague sense of disappointment with this whole season. It's just been a real yawner for me. For the record I've been watching Who religiously since the 1980's. I've seen most of what came before and all of the reboot. I've only once taken a long break, while 6 was in the Tardis, but I think I am about to take another. I just don't like where the show is going anymore. This won't make me popular but at this point I'd revamp the whole thing yet again. New Doctor, new companions, new head, new writers, start it all over again. The main series it needs an overhaul in the worst way. It's gone very stale, I think.

It's generally implied that the Doctor has chosen celibacy over the course of the years apart from earlier in his life with having a child and grand-daughter.  (Apart from River Song of course) I think at the least the Doctor would prefer someone with a similar life span to his own for a relationship.

The second point was more to do with a hypothetical musing, If the Doctor never became female after all his regenerations that he had allotted, but say if after this 13th he becomes female after all the times he was male, does this mean Time Lords all become female but not as much as they become male or do all Time Lords spend much of their lives as one gender so there are equal numbers of males and females then just some times they change to allow them to carry children.

You could ""call"" a drone to you, attach the mail and give the driver an address and the driver could get it there faster than pretty much any other way. Or if you ordered something on Amazon there could be a ""get it now"" option where it will be attached to a drone and delivered straight to your GPS coordinates.

I should like to express the appreciation of countless Germans, who regard me as their spokesman, for the wise and beneficial public support which you have given to a policy that we all hope will contribute to the enduring pacification of Europe. Just as we are fanatically determined to defend ourselves against attack, so do we reject the idea of taking the initiative in bringing about a war. I am convinced that no one who fought in the front trenches during the world war, no matter in what European country, desires another conflict. 

**Lord Rothermere, telegram to Adolf Hitler (1st October, 1938)**
My dear Fuhrer everyone in England is profoundly moved by the bloodless solution to the Czechoslovakian problem. People not so much concerned with territorial readjustment as with dread of another war with its accompanying bloodbath. Frederick the Great was a great popular figure. I salute your Excellency’s star, which rises higher and higher.

In the UK, the very furthest we would go would be to have a state insurance provider which everybody is entitled to use - not breaking the principle of free at the point of use. Some services might be paid for, but only if you can afford it (see dental care). 

We're much closer already, to the American system, you can buy private health care insurance to obtain a different level of care.

First off I would definitely recommend going to a GP or speaking with a pharmacist and really explaining the issue, how it affects you and what you want in the short term and long term. Don't be shy in asking for a referral to a dermatologist or switching GPs if you don't like the one you have at the moment.

Don't be afraid of steroid creams, they're wonderful when used properly. Take a look at your diet, this is something you have to manage for the whole of your life, unfortunately there isn't a cream that will make it go away. 

Oily fish, cutting out over processed white stuff, and vegetables made the biggest difference in my family. It's annoying but it works. Sunlight also helped, as did exercise (stress relief)! Try keeping a skin diary, it's really helpful to see how your skin reacts to the different changes and it will help your doctor too.

From what I understand of SD, be gentle with your skin. Obviously it's important to keep your skin free of sebum and oil, Simple Kind To Skin Refreshing Facial Wash is SLS/SLES free but is very good but not stripping. Lanolin, urea, lactic acid are very good at hydrating sensitive skin. My sister has recently fallen in love with [Eucerin 5% Urea Night Cream](http://www.eucerin.co.uk/products/urea/smoothing-night-creme-5percent-urea) (she uses it in the day). **Also ask for samples!** *Every company I have emailed explaining I have sensitive skin have been happy to send me out samples or told me that if I buy the product and it doesn't work, just return it to them and they'll refund me.*

Her routine is cleanse face with [**konjac sponge**](http://www.superdrug.com/Superdrug/Superdrug-Pebbles-Konjac-Sponge/p/621570) and water (she doesn't wear makeup whislt she's recovering from a flareup) 

[**Rohto Hada Labo Super Hyaluronic Acid Lotion**](http://www.skinandtonics.com/rohto-hada-labo-gokujyn-super-hyaluronic-acid-lotion-review/) (actually a toner)

[**Simple KTS Soothing Toner**](http://www.waitrose.com/shop/DisplayProductFlyout?productId=39931)  (full of soothing niacinamide and panthenol)

[**Eucerin Moisturiser**] (http://www.eucerin.co.uk/products/urea/smoothing-night-creme-5percent-urea) 

Which she mixes with medical grade [**lanolin**](http://www.boots.com/en/Lanolips-101-Ointment-The-Ultra-Pure-Grade-lanolin-ointment-_1132900/) at night and during the day if she needs it.



If the skin is really burning and sensitive to anything you put on there, stick with dampening your skin an just lanolin, or mix together some pure vegetable glycerin with Vaseline and apply that to your face at night.

I mean seriously, it started with *""I like it when you use my name""* and *""Are you asking me out on a date?""*, and progressed to making the Doctor sleep on the floor in a tent with a dog bowl next to it. Not to mention keeping Jack chained up in the basement. Then when he comes back later, makes bitchy comments about how the Doctor *""loves playing with Earth Girls.,""* then proceeds to turn *everyone on earth into copies of himself.* He's jealous of the attention the Doctor gives humans, so he *became* humanity. 

Plus there's his *""I can't decide""* routine with Ten, dancing around with him and singing. Because this is still technically a family show we got the cleaned up version of the song - it cut off the first verse:

&gt; *It's not easy having yourself a good time*
&gt; 
&gt; *Greasing up those bets and betters*
&gt; 
&gt; *Watching out they don't four-letter*

&gt; *Fuck and kiss you both at the same time*
&gt; 
&gt; *Smells-like something I've forgotten*
&gt; 
&gt; *Curled up died and now it's rotten* 


And I think it makes sense. The Master has always been obsessed with the Doctor, and we know they were very close once until something happened that drove them apart. They constantly fight but neither seems to be able to actually bring themselves to kill the other. The Master follows him everywhere, expresses jealousy over the Doctor's companions, and most of his evil plans seem to boil down to *""Do absolutely anything to get the Doctor's attention.""* Some of the Classic!Who episodes with him, he literally gained absolutely nothing except the Doctor's attention (E.g., *The King's Demons*).

false,Snoron,cnty-england,Bradford,"Our trade is ""internal"" except that there are a *lot* of trade deals being made by the EU at the moment.

EU + South Korea already have one.

EU + Japan is on the books.

EU + Canada (CETA) was signed a few months ago and could potentially come into effect in 2016.

EU + USA (TTIP) may very well go ahead too.

Let me tell you one thing with absolute certainty: The EU will get better trading terms for the UK than the UK could ever dream of doing with any of these countries on its own!

""Sovereignty and independence"" is another matter entirely, of course - if you put a lot of stock into those things then it is a legitimate personal opinion for wanting to leave the EU. Personally I'm not too remotely concerned about laws that the EU makes - at least no more than I am about ones the UK makes itself. And I don't really have any strong national feelings either. I'm not a conservative by far, so go figure.

But if you're really arguing on economic grounds then I sincerely believe you are mistaken. Not only would we lose out on so many trade benefits as above but we'd also lose out with the rest of the EU as well. You know one reason why so much trade is internal? Because it's cheap - it's close by, there's no barriers. Sure we could gain some with Japan and the US, but we'd a) lose a lot too, and b) the argument for Japan and the US is likely to disappear entirely in a few years anyway, so that would be *very* short-sighted!

Oh and before I stop typing, let's just throw in the ASEAN trade deal too - Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand.

Now if everyone likes British shit so much, we're about to see our exports go through the roof *thanks to* the EU.

*Edit: I just remembered a nifty map too showing the trade differences that a deal like TTIP will make: http://i.imgur.com/Rj0Re5s.jpg - look how much we're gonna benefit from that one! And Canada loses out pretty big here, but thanks to CETA it will average that out too (and hurt countries not in the EU even more).

So... do you know what this map would look like if the UK wasn't in the EU? :) Let me give you a hint: It'd be brown.

Also notice Japan gets hurt too, and S. Korea actually benefits slightly (due to them already being in a trade agreement with the EU).

The great thing is that this means the EU gets a huge upper hand in negotiating future agreements too because all of the countries negatively affected will be even more desperate to sign up with us!

You probably hear all the time about how being in the EU makes us a strong force in the world, being able to ""bully"" huge countries into accepting our terms that would be otherwise bullying us. You don't often get figures and realistic near-term (1-5 years) examples of exactly the sorts of differences this would make. But well, here you go!

The UK would get absolutely shafted deal after deal outside of the EU, just like poor Norway, Switzerland, etc! Just look at em! That could be us, getting poorer!",0,1415150416,null,0,1415151024,0,clt84ew,t3_2l9n49,t1_clt84ew,t1_clt2yrv,null,1426187971,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

Generally Russell Group unis are worth a look and online university rankings can be helpful for thinning the herd, but don't get bogged down with prestige and snobbery.

2. None particularly. There may be a few cultural differences to the UK (such as our drinking age being 18, so clubbing and getting drunk are massive parts of student culture) but nothing too crazy. The main issue would be funding - as an international student, uni is more expensive for you and you'll need a way to pay for that and your livings costs.

3. Your grades this year count massively on how unis will look at you, as do your predicted grades. Also, some unis may convert American grades to English ones differently - be careful of that. You can apply to 5 unis. Depending on how confident you are, I'd apply to two excellent ones, two decent ones and one lower one.

Kane

Experiment time.  Lamela only played a bit on Sunday, and I want to see Kane play as the lone striker.  I want to see if he can be as effective when he's the sole focus of the CBs.  Even against weak opposition, that will tell us something.  I'd like to have Chadli and Eriksen available, as well as Ade.  If Kane isn't working, try sending Ade to play with him for a bit, and then if it still doesn't work swap Kane for one of Chadli or Eriksen.  I realize that leaves us with just Ade on the pitch as a striker, but on top of being confident that we can get a win in that situation, we need to try and get him back into some kind of form.

Although it is annoying that it takes such a long time to do, I for one don't think we would have anywhere near as much power in the negotiations as we currently do through the EU which is the largest economic bloc the world has ever known when taken together - the US and Japan will treat us as such when negotiating the trade deals.

I see these as serious problem but not so intractable that they couldn't be mostly solved in a matter of weeks if the EU decided to hash out some new treaties.

IIRC when shit was going down with Franco, the Nou Camp was used as a shelter and for other non-football related activities, hence the people of Barcelona gave the club a meaning, something that didn’t happen with Espayol. 

Now a days its fueled because they are two amazing teams and the Ronaldo-Messi rivalry. But it used to be tied with Madrid representing the Capital (Government HQ per say) and the desire for independence was tied to a club. It’s also a reason they call it ¨Mes que un club¨

I’m not gonna lie, I’m a huge Real Madrid fan and Liverpool fan. I get downvoted every time I say it. I don’t care. But I thought I should let you know. Rivalry was tied to other things that were not football related.

The toy originally went from Clara to the young Danny Pink, through the Pink family line to Orson Pink, and then back to Clara.  She in turn gave it to the young Doctor to help him overcome his fears.

Will the Doctor give the toy back to Clara?  Does that now make her the one who passes it on through the Pink family line to Orson Pink?

And if the Doctor gives it back to her it completes the loop wherein she gave it to him to help him overcome his fears.  He gives it back to her for the same ""fear makes companions of us all"" reasons.

Does he know that she gave the toy to Danny before she gave it to him?  Does he give it to her as a memento of Danny, or just to make her feel better and help her overcome her fears?  Or does he acknowledge that she gave it to him in in the first place?

It could happen or I could just be heading off on some alternate time line.  And don’t over-think the use of “it” and “toy”.

Everyone I know was raised supporting the ROI. I'm a Irish republican, I don't want NI to exist as a political entity. Why would I support the team of a state that I don't want to exist? Surely my support of the football team would be a form of flaccid support of the state? I remember watching a documentary about when the GDR played West Germany in the 74 world cup; The people from the GDR were raging that they beat West Germany because they thought it would give the state a political victory, thus helping to perpetuate its existence. Different scenarios I know but it's the same kind of idea.

If you add to that the fact that many, not all, but many NI fans are openly vocal loyalists. (with people like Gregory Campbell, Jamie Bryson and the Zionist Loyalist from Bangor in the video below standing on the terrace).

However, that wound was, itself, part of the Doctor's timestream, so the Doctor entered his timestream and saved Clara from it, guiding her to the wound.

false,hexanaticious,wardr,Hurt,"Depends on if it the series I'd be set to Pen still could have Capaldi or not. I don't think my ideas would write well for him. Assuming we don't get around to the 'seen this face before' plot I'd give my own take on it.

Short version, and it would require a multi-doctor and companion season finale. The season would have two two parters written by me, one for midseason, one for the finale, I would find 7 writers I like for Monster of the week episodes, giving the one with the best script a two part episode, and the one who wrote the 'silly' episode, or didn't need all the screen time a bit of an insert for the beginning of the season to tack onto their episode.

Now having established the running plan here's what I'd do. As we go through the first episode, the doctor getting ready to confront the big bad written by our guest writer, and having gotten everything ready to turn their power against them or otherwise defeat them, the doctor arrives to find the monster already defeated. This leads to a 'what?' moment, and some minor speculation before moving on with the episode. 

We move through the series as normal, hopefully somewhere in the middle one of the writers can pen an episode of the doctor being paranoid (Somewhat inspired by hide) where the who episode has the doctor 'chasing ghosts' so to speak, and running down conspiracy theorists hoaxes. This episode is the first obvious case of the series 'clue' which is two figures walking off screen followed by an off key TARDIS noise, played clearly for the first time when the doctor's TARDIS has already left.

The midseason two part episode isn't something that explains well in a quick bit of text since it's a lot of visual to get the ideas across, but it starts off with the doctor meeting some new aliens we haven't seen before after deciding to try for random. The aliens being something akin to space hippies, except their technology is almost entirely wood based. (Possibly leading to the doctor making a sonic screwdriver that only works on wood ). These aliens are up against a big bad that is likewise unfamiliar, being a robotic type race we haven't seen before (Not cyberman, but not humanoid either). The first two parter ends with the doctor staring, his face shocked upon breaking open one of the alien's shell. The next episode reveals it to be a dalek inside, and focuses on the question of why something so different from a dalek exists while the doctor tries to stop them and save the 'space hippies'. 

We continue on, the season still occasionally slipping in hints of a strange TARDIS noise as the plotline. The trends of this season of the doctor being somewhat uncaring in the face of death becoming more apparent as the season progresses. 

We get to the season finale. Encountering a situation where there are two sides to be chosen from and neither is the right one, but one the Doctor agrees with more (Ideally something that can polarize the audience while not being something as bad as Kill the Moon) What we see is something somewhat expected and unexpected at this point, as the episode builds motivations and moves us towards the climax of the first half of the finale we encounter another Doctor we've seen before, opposing the doctor we know. (Eccleston being my first choice given how pitting him against Capaldi seems fitting) we are shown that this other doctor isn't 'evil' but isn't a past doctor by his choice of companion being someone familiar but who he hadn't traveled with (Karen as Amy perhaps, or Matt Smith paired with Martha Jones, more or less a doctor with a companion in the series we haven't seen work together ). More or less giving us an excuse for a Doctor vs 'Doctor' episode with the fate of two universes (or alternate timelines) hanging in the balance. 

Assuming the above is possible, the 'doctor lite' episode of the season would hopefully focus on the alternate doctor and his companion from an outsider's perspective, showing hints of the two acting separate from each other, without revealing they are working together (in order to provide misdirection into assuming that it's a timeline cross instead of what it really is when leaks get out) ",0,1415161356,null,0,false,0,cltdlyl,t3_2larhj,t1_cltdlyl,t3_2larhj,null,1426185411,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

false,TLKv3,null,null,"Long winded idea incoming...

Men, women, children and alien alike are calling for The Doctor's help. He has no idea how his TARDIS' phone number has reached so many people. He goes to each one and solves their problem for them, while subtle images of a head, then singular portions of a body then finally a tail going into the head are found in each episode in which he encounters one of these callers. Finally after he encounters the last caller in episode 9 he realizes what's going on. Every caller has been testing him on a different attribute. Intelligence, determination, courage, mental fortitude, etc. He's been gauged to see if he is in fact the real Doctor and a Time Lord. And each caller has given him a number to remember in their own unique ways. A house's street number, a number on the back of a jacket, a number attached to a necklace, little things such as this that nobody would recognize but him. On top of that, he realizes the callers have been Clara copies. Two of them eventually meet by accident, touch and create a paradox explosion that nearly blindsides The Doctor outside the TARDIS. He realizes what they were too late.

He then pieces the numbers together and finds a final destination: Trenzalore shortly before 11 traveled there. 12 arrives and is immediately captured by the townsfolk who have no idea who he is (this is before he defended their planet). Its revealed the townsfolk are being controlled by someone... someone with a tattoo on their arm as he wakes up and sees through his blurry vision... the Ouroboros tattoo.

The Corsair has taken The Doctor prisoner with Clara neutralized in a cage. A Corsair post-HOUSE and ""the Doctor's Wife"". She (yes she, she's a ""bad girl"" again) reveals that she did not in fact die in the pocket dimension of HOUSE. Instead she had offered up her then-regeneration's limbs as a toll for HOUSE to allow her exit after HOUSE explained many TARDISes had visited him in years past. The Corsair questioned HOUSE more effectively than The Doctor bothered to do and learned HOUSE existed post-Time Lock Gallifrey events and knows of its location however its unreachable. Only but 2 Time Lords/Ladies had managed to escape that location but ended up on HOUSE's dinner plate. The Corsair bargained with HOUSE. Giving her arm, spine and kidneys to HOUSE's caretakers in exchange for letting her ""die"" and regenerate. She did so, into this regeneration, and was told by HOUSE that upon exit she must send out another distress signal to lure more TARDISes there. This is how The Corsair's distress signal was delivered to The Doctor. On top of that, HOUSE allowed the Corsair to take a ""sample"" of himself to inject into The Corsair to give him all of HOUSE's knowledge. Thus driving Corsair beyond insane.

The Corsair was driven mad as well by the idea that Gallifrey was unreachable had traveled through time and space, venturing all over and learning wise tales of The Doctor killing all the Time Lords and/or sealing it away leaving them alive and hidden. She however was slowly able to work out an approximate location but only the faintest of signals could be intercepted by someone trying to reach out back to her. Over time she additionally became obsessed with going home again and decided to finally seek out The Doctor. She then drew some of The Doctor's ""blood"" which they describe as ""essence of coagulated time energy itself"" which she would then inject into herself giving The Doctor's memories and ""thoughts of his time"" to her. She would then learn Gallifrey's location and travel home. She does so and it works but The Doctor's mind mixed with HOUSE's and The Corsair's is too much for one body and The Corsair begins to establish a way to move through The Doctor's incarnations' lock on Gallifrey. A portal is ripped open and The Corsair dies having her last sight be of Gallifrey is ruin, burning and under siege by ground troop Daleks citing ""what have I awoken"". The Doctor frees himself only for a moment as Clara breaks free of her cage to help.

Its then finally revealed the one sending signals to The Corsair was the Gallifreyan Clara copy. The Doctor asks why as Gallifrey Clara states they demand liberation from this Hell. The Doctor is caught off guard suddenly by a handful of ships exiting the rift which he screams for her to close but she says she cannot. Clara then states they know of a way to close it, a paradox. Something impossible erasing the space in which it began in the first place. She then reaches out after convincing Gallifrey Clara that it needs to close and as their hands touch, a paradox explosion erupts sealing the rift to Gallifrey once more.

However now lamenting the loss of Clara and yet another one of his people, The Corsair, he realizes he has to track down the Time Lock escapees and find out who they are and what to do with them. (The Rani, The Master, Rassilon, etc. could all play into the future now being free of the Time Lock without needing Gallifrey to be shown)

If you talk to Windy or anyone who has watched our youth for years, they will all tell you the same thing about Mason. He was right at the top of the list of our prospects and probably should have been given a chance earlier.

these are among the kind of conditions that cause social dysfunction (which, if cost is all you care about, costs a lot of money), even if we might end out richer, it's going to be a shitty society with a lot of inequality where it's not very good to be rich anyway because you are still living in a shithole with a lot of dysfunctional people. 

immigration obviously isnt the only thing causing that sort of thing but it does play a part. i dont like to use purely materialist means to talk about it, but if you want to make an analogy of the UK as a business, the native youth population is our main capital in the long run, immigration is a very lucrative way to make some money but if you neglect your main capital which you still have to pay upkeep for (and the upkeep gets bigger and bigger the more it's neglected), in the long term you are destroying yourself. immigrants are not likely to stick around when the going gets tough here and if that's what we rely on, should we start to lag behind other economies then we are going to find ourselves up shit creek without a paddle.",0,1415168795,null,0,false,0,cltglfd,t3_2l9n49,t1_cltglfd,t1_clstumr,null,1426183918,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

The way I see it, with things like animal testing and nuclear, is that in an ideal world we wouldn't need this. With a growth in Green support and these policies put forward, it's not going to be a situation where suddenly they're banned. But it's going to alert those in research fields and relevant businesses that it's time to put more effort into finding alternatives to undesirable but necessary practices.

In the episode where Moriarty was strapping bombs to people and Sherlock had to find them before they blew up, the old woman on the phone described Moriarty's voice to be 'soft.' His voice is anything but. Also, why would he have gone through so much effort to hide his identity and blow up an old woman who gave away his voice when he planned to show himself to Sherlock later at the pool.

The Moriarty we got to know also setup Sherlock as a murder by having a really convincing second life as an 'actor.' Probably because he was just that, an actor.

If one of those courses looks interesting you'll need to check what's involved carefully before you apply.

There's a fair bit of info on the site for international students that should help, but one thing to bear in mind is that not all universities are campus based, and even if they are, you'll probably only get to live in for your first year. (And if you're late applying for halls possibly not even then). That means you're probably going to end up spending a couple of years in shared houses or flats with other students, so what the rental market is like where you want to study should be taken into account when you're deciding where to go.

According to the theory, the events that 9 was pictured in (titanic, JFK, etc) were done in the time that the tardis was gone before he comes back for Rose. What appeared to her to be a few seconds could have been any amount of time for 9 to pop around and see some of the sights.

The issue is that in order for a company in the UK to offer visas to people they must be registered with the government to be allowed to apply for visas, and the number and type of companies that can register to apply is restricted.

Then if the company is allowed to apply for visas they must demonstrate that they have advertised the job across the EU without finding a suitable applicant. Then and only then are they allowed to apply for visas.

I'm in favour of a points based immigration system wherein immigrants with desirable skills, roots here, English speaking ability. No criminal record would be able to move here easier than immigrants without those things. This would include prioritising immigrants seeking jobs for industries that we have a shortage of employment in. We could also plan our infrastructure to be built to accommodate how much immigration we'd receive,me hitch we cannot currently do. This would end up having the effect of less immigration overall. So if this is what you mean by ""anti immigration"", then I'm anti immigration.

&gt;It also mentions wages for ""indigenous"" (ugh) Brits being driven down.

Not sure why you're groaning at the idea of indigenous Brits. It's only mass immigration of the modern age that's changed the following.

Of course businesses will always pay as little as possible, but if the pool of available workers is smaller, then theymhave to charge a decent wage, or they'd have no workers, right now they have a near infinite supply of cheap workers, who can often work at or even below the minimum wage, since when they send the money back home it's worth far more, something Brits don't have the luxury of doing.",0,1415177343,null,0,false,0,cltiqzn,t3_2lbpiu,t1_cltiqzn,t1_cltgzos,null,1426182841,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

In the last 8 years I have been up here and out walking the dogs, I have found various animal carcases that have partially eaten.   I have spent a good proportion of my life living in various bits of Africa and although not a naturalist or anything , I can tell the difference between a big cat kill and a dead thing that's been pulled to bits by dogs or something.  According to the local farmers in the pub - its quite common to lose live stock this way and you frequently hear of ""sightings"" which may or may not be bin bags at dawn in the distance.

There is also a story about a localish bloke who had a load of big cats as pets in the 80's before the law changed.  Apparently be couldn't house them after the law change and was seen driving his van up onto the Moor a few times before he killed himself - that much is true because he was done for drink driving late at night outside Camelford.  Just as in all good legends though, no one knows what happened to the cats after he died. 

My take on it?  Yeah I reckon there are animals up here on the moor that aren't indigenous to the UK.  The mad zoo keeper from Tintagel dumped his pets, and in the subsequent years, some have survived and breed.  DEFRA and the police don't want to get involved because its going to cost a fortune to track what ever it is down.  If they ignore the problem, maybe it will go away of its own accord.

Personally I think counties are too small to be ""states"", after all American States are made up of counties (which have a small amount of local power). I do think however that power to raise taxes should be moved away from London to a pre WWI level.

Before the two world wars, if I remember correctly, most county/local councils got their revenue from local taxes and could make local by-laws. Throughout the wars power and revenue income was centralised in London which has never really been de-centralised again. If I remember correctly from ""Union and Disunion"" by Linda Colley.

Ideally this would be what we should be doing, de-centralising power and revenue back to the counties to their pre WWI levels. We've got ourselves into a bit of a pickle though, because of the State level governance we have set up based on old national lines.

No it won't. Positive facts and figures about immigration rarely feature in the debate.

The arguement is always about more nebulous things think 'Integration' , 'Culture' and 'British Values' because unlike the economic argument that's harder to objectively prove either way.

In my view, any 'reform' in immigration policy should look at strengthening local services before they're initially put under the strain of increased population, since as this report shows, they money either is, or will be, there.

Edit:
&gt;It's not about the money. You can't put a price on identity or social cohesion or community which are all things mass immigration threatens. This report is like being told by some bloodthirsty capitalist that it's okay that your family is being sold into slavery because GDP is up. Who cares if they add £5bn? I don't care if they add £20bn.

This is the key point. It doesn't matter to your average voter whether the UK economy is £20bn better off. It sounds like a lot of money but it's miniscule dent in the budget.

What matters to them is seeing their local areas change with vast numbers of immigration causing huge pressure on local services which aren't able to keep up with the influx.

So fair enough we are getting an extra £20bn, great that's good for the economy and good for business. It's not really good for anyone trying to go to the GP or get to the hospital or trying to get their children in a school that isn't full of kids speaking broken English.

Why not an immigration policy that separates the wheat from the chaff? For both EU and non EU citizens that want to move here, we could choose them based on whether they're beneficial to us or not, we could make it easier to move here if you have roots here,mid you speak english, etc.

As far as outgoings are concerned, I would like to see the rot cleared out as well as those who simply bloat the squad removed. For me the squad should be as follows:

                              Soldado(Kane)

                               Lloris(Vorm)



Adebayor: can't leave due to ACON (who would buy him?), so he stays put. 

Bentaleb: can cover any from the double pivot, but excessive depth may see him go on loan. 

Chiriches: Is well off the pace currently and a loan would probably do wonders for him

Paulinho: On the list but I would still like to see him gone, if not in January certainly by the summer. I hope Carroll can kick on in his Swansea loan.

BAE: Try to get him out this window, just soaking up funds

Since I was forced from my 3G T-Mobile contract ( which was great )  and onto EE 4G, tethering my computer to my phone ( which as I'm travelling a lot I do a lot ) has become a complete waste of time in most places. Ringing EE and explaining the problem is like hitting my head against a brick wall. They do not want to know and do not care. They try and blame it on my phone. It's not my phone. 

I'm basically paying double the money for not even half the service. I  never receive 4G unless I'm in a large city ( and even then it's crap ) I do not get HSPA ( never mind HSPA+ ) I don't even get 3G half the time, I get GPRS or EDGE which is useless. 

Now I know ( because I once watched the F1 in HD right the way down the M1 and beyond on 4G the week before they switched me from my T-mobile contract ) that the network does work and it works well. The problem - I think - is that EE are heavily restricting it. 

Don't even get me started on the fact that their bullshit internet age restrictions appear in different parts of the country even though I turned it off by ringing EE ( even reddit is blocked with that )  Luckily I have a Private VPN to deal with that.

I have read that people who want to be actual journalists are better off doing a degree in something else (English for example, or History) then going on to do a masters in journalism or just writing while studying and getting into it that way but I am by no means an expert.

I would just google the University league tables to get an idea of the best ones. Some may be known specifically for journalism, but it is unlikely for a niche subject like that so just go with one as high up as you can.

Because I just don't buy the explanation, and it doesn't jive with what we see in the story.  

Just ponder this:  If souls in the nethersphere still feel everything that happens to their body, why isn't Danny Pink in agony from his corpse being frozen in the morgue?

Truly being frozen is (so I hear) an absolutely hellish experience.  He wouldn't be having a pleasant chat with the intern.  He'd be in ""OHGODMAKEITSTOPMAKEITSTOP"" territory.   Yet he only seems to be a bit chilly, while being told that cremation is the worst thing imaginable.

*The UCL study does find that migrants from outside the EU have cost the country more in public services than the fiscal contribution they have made in taxes and national insurance. The figure, £118bn over the period 1995-2011, is mainly due to their larger family sizes and lower employment levels.*

*However, the authors add that this was true during the early part of the 16-year period, but more recently non-European migrants have also made a positive fiscal contribution – about £5bn more in taxes than the amount they receive in benefits.*

Does this mean over the whole 16 year period we've seen a £118bn cost by non-EU immigrants, but recently the trend has changed and, over some period, they've actually contributed about £5bn?

Immigrants contribute less and take more from the system, as they get older, have families, at about the same rate as the native population.

When immigrants are young and in work, they contribute as much as natives who are young and in work.
When they get older they take as much as older natives.

The only real difference is the higher level of employment among immigrants, which again is no surprise, because people immigrate to work, and if they cannot find work, they can go back home to a country that is often desperately short of skilled labour.

&gt; If he didn't care why did he write the book in the first place and why has he spent the last few years risking his career by rocking the boat in such a way?

Please tell me how hes been ""risking his career"", the media in this country has far more power over MPs and politicians than the fucking politicians do. Give me one instance where a celebrity has written a book about politics criticising ""the establishment"" (what are you 5?) and they have subsequently lost their career. Do you know what IPSO is? Its media **self regulation**, the MPs cant do shit and your assumption that they some how are all knowing all powerful beings is a crock of shit.

&gt; He's literally the only person who is reflecting that side of public opinion in the media or establishment and I'm grateful for it

**NO NO NO**, he is the only person who **YOU** see that is ""reflecting public opinion"" (more like your own misinformed opinion).

There are hundreds of authors that are critical of this government that offer real debate on issues, just because you are not aware of them because of your apathy doesnt mean i am not aware of them.

&gt; His book launch had charitable aspects to it, and as far as celebrities go he's at least somewhat genuine

Debatable, he went on SNL and tried to talk about his book, the host challenged him and brought real evidence to backup his claim. What did your hero Russell Brand do? Made fun of his evidence because it was a graph.

He gave no counter points, he just said ""look everyone its ok now, hes got a graph"".

Oh wow, such a smart individual, please tell me more about how he will lead this country to greatness (more like further into the shitter).

&gt; And anyway, why exactly do you expect a comedian who spent most of his life as an unemployed heroin addict to have ""solutions""?

If he doesnt have solutions why do i want to read his book? There are hundreds of different, more coherent and intelligent authors that discuss and offer solutions to the exact same problems brand does.

But i know you are only aware of Brandy-Wandy because you are too apathetic to do any of your own research but continue to whine about ""the establishment"".

&gt; How would he have ""solutions"" to deconstructing an entire political system and building it back up again from scratch?

haha, oh wait you are serious.

Well whether you like it or not the current system has improved life in this country for the average person immeasurably, and whether you like it or not it works fairly well.

It has problems like any system has problems, but debating and resolving those problems in the public is what politics is all about. Criticism of ""the establishment"" is fine, i enjoy debate about what is currently wrong with the political system; but Brand offers no new points to debate, he offers no solutions to debate but what he does offer is a so called ""revolution"" which is just a marketing ploy to get you to buy his garbage book.

If you actually want to discuss the political system in britain read some political authors like ""Purple Homicide: Fear and Loathing on Knutsford Heath"" by John Sweeney(i doubt youll enjoy it though, not as dumbed down or simplistic as Brandy-Wandys Booky-Wooky).

&gt; No single person would be able to formulate a ""solution"" to such a large problem. It's like you genuinely expect him to have come up with a brand new political system to replace democracy and capitalism

Its like you genuinely believe that democracy and capitalism need replacing when over the last 200 years alone this country has advanced at an immense rate and the general populations lives have improved by a massive amount.

Perhaps we should implement dictatorship and communism because they are such good models of political and economic stability... you are literally the most misinformed person ive ever met.

&gt; You don't have a solution either, so does that mean you can't speak or criticise the system? Does it bollocks

i didnt write a book calling for ""revolution"", btw revolution leads to death and violence so id rather live under the current ""broken"" system than have me or my family/friends killed because some pop star thinks hes being insightful and ""helping"".

&gt; I like him! He's not perfect but he's the best we've got right now. Every other celebrity doesn't dare say what he says because it's such a massive risk to their own career and I respect him for taking that risk, because it is a massive risk.

Its really not, there are hundreds of political authors and writters that criticise the establishment, Britain has one of the best press freedom indexs of any country and you are as apathetic and misinformed just as Brand is.

So while obviously the party you'd be voting for has those stances, there's a lot of variation even within the Green movement and you might find that some of those issues barely received majority within the party. That means that if you wanted to change them, you might actually be able to rally support within the party for it.

I would never advocate joining a political party to change their policies, because that's kind of back-to-front, however if you otherwise agree with their outlook and most of how they aim to get there, I would definitely encourage you to get involved with policymaking in the party, so you can have more influence in that. Also, you could maybe ask around for the evidence that they've based their policies on because the Greens are a very evidence-influenced party, so even on things like nuclear, they won't have made that aim without having evidence that it's not just possible but attainable, probably with some real life examples, so you could ask for some further reading if you wanted. If you email them and say that you're interested in joining and supporting them but would like to know more about what specific evidence they have for x, y and z, they should be able to get back to you with some of what they have.

The village I live in has seen a ton of development, all done in a haphazard manner where the property developer doesn't have to pay a penny towards improving the infrastructure to support the new load.

We have congested roads, overloaded sewers, full schools but no one is expecting the developers to pay to improve that - instead they want more houses, and the county council wants it to happen. In the council's desire to have these houses, they allowed a developer to build all around the school, so it is unable to expand short of building on top of the playground. Good one. We're taxiing children to neighbouring villages' schools, which are now full as well.

It simply isn't sustainable. And there's questions over the suitability of what they are building - at least one new estate appears to be plagued with for sale signs because people move in, realise how small and shit the houses are, and want to move out. Personally I'm wondering if brown envelopes aren't involved somewhere. Developments that were previously denied get approved with the minimum of changes.

We need houses, but we need to make sure they're built properly and with the local infrastructure in mind.

You're right. In fact, some areas of the UK have a negative net migration, because they have so many people emigrating. Although that's less common, migration is less of a contributor to big population changes than, for example, a change in birth rate. The net migration in England in 2012 was 158,000 ([source](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/compendiums/compendium-of-uk-statistics/population-and-migration/index.html)), while there were 729,674 live births in England and Wales in 2012 ([source](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/vsob1/birth-summary-tables--england-and-wales/2012/stb-births-in-england-and-wales-2012.html)) so migration, which includes many adults who go straight into working, only added 1/3 as many people to the population as births which involve the state automatically providing for them to varying degrees until at least 16, with some spending going on until they're 21, so the small population increase is also a population increase that the state benefits from almost immediately.

Just wanted to point that out to you, because that's actually a reasonably common assumption that immigration always means population increase while in my corner of the UK, we had -2000 net migration in 2012 because more people emigrated than immigrated, and overall the increase is of a completely different sort to birth rates increasing.",0,1415188262,null,0,false,0,cltkqb6,t3_2lbzx0,t1_cltkqb6,t3_2lbzx0,null,1426181916,4,false,UKGreens,t5_34166,4

That's a list of the top universities for journalism/publish/PR. Of those, I'd be inclined to apply for Sheffield, Leeds, Kent, Cardiff and one other of your choice (maybe one with lower entrance requirements). But there'll be more than one league table and it's worth looking at 3 or 4 to compare where each university is on them. 

Sheffield, Leeds and Cardiff are russell Group which are the UK equivalent of Ivy League (although not all of them are as prestigious). They'll be reasonably well respected by employers.

2. People will probably find your accent quite irritating, especially if you're a guy. You'll need to learn to keep your voice down. But *don't* fake an accent. Also lots of small but significant adjustments: our weather will be worse, perhaps different foods, football here is real football, not hand-egg. Etc. You'll need to learn not to use your american words because people will get confused by you using college &amp;amp; school when you mean university. 

3. Check the grade requirements for each university. It will be on their website on the course page you want to do. It might say ""for international admissions click here"" or something. You might have to email them and ask about your chances of being admitted with your current scores and such, and they'll be honest.

You'll also find the international student costs on there. I checked it for you for sheffield: £15,410 per year. That's almost $25,000 just for tuition. It's not cheap.

During periods when the UK economy heavily benefited from high immigration figures as there were enough jobs and infrastructure had room to absorb more numbers.

Let's take HS2 as an example. Will cost £50bn-80bn. Without mass immigration this idea wouldn't have got even close to planning.

Exploitation can happen to anyone in any business, and does.

However it's *more likely* to happen in systematically in a business with smaller margins and smaller profits. Anyone who has worked for a failing SME will know the compulsory unpaid overtime, the late pay, the failure to provide workers with the right training or equipment and so on. And whilst lots of staff leave these jobs quickly, for a lot of staff they have no choice, it's that or unemployment/sanctioning in some cases.

Essentially, these low quality businesses don't have the margins to compete *without* exploiting their workers.

Not adequately looking after your staff is a risk as you are open to being sued or worse (criminal liability in some cases). As such it makes bad business sense for a 'good' business with strong growth and profitability to run that risk.

We can argue philosophy and semantics without agreeing, but the reality remains that the disagreement we have is over the subjective issues.

No you aren't. We don't have a ""control"" that we can measure them against. But a measurement of GNP, freedoms or any other quality of life measurement puts former British colonies ahead of their neighbours that either were other colonies or uncolonised in most cases.

&gt;The native population made a negative contribution in 12 years during the period, running to £591 billion in total, as the British economy ran at a deficit.

&gt;Since 2000 European migrants were 43 per cent less likely than native Britons to receive benefits or tax credits, and 7 per cent less likely to live in social housing, the report said.

hmm, you may want reconsider that statement.  I just checked UKIP policy on immigration.  Obviously this would drop immigration to near zero.  Private Education and Health Insurance for 5 years?!  Only the very richest can afford that!

• Immigrants must financially support themselves and their dependents for 5 years. This means private health insurance (except emergency medical care), private education and private housing - they should pay into the pot before they take out of it. 

• A points-based visa system and time-limited work permits. 

• Proof of private health insurance must be a precondition for immigrants and tourists to enter the UK.

The real issue is if construction stabilises when it has picked up the slack. Of course the problem in the UK is even during boom time we weren't building enough properties.

We do not have a construction bubble in the UK. It isn't like Spain and Ireland where people were building more houses than the population could possibly need. Any big increase in construction is a good thing. If anything that market could do with a bit of lubricating.

But a lot of influence comes from soft power - the ability to make other countries stand beside you and build blocks supporting/blocking certain initiatives. Unfortunately UK might have lowered its power to do that in EU by alienating allies with constantly talking about renegotiating and quitting EU. Poland was a country that would back UK fairly often (frequently in opposition to Germany and France), but that carries a risk now. UK might leave the EU but Poland and others will stay and will have to deal with the France and Germany and nobody wants to get branded as an outsider.

I wrote that just to point out that influence is more than just pure number of votes and that it is also a dynamic process even if the numbers themselves do not change. Complex stuff.

It's not strictly an open door, but that's generally the premise behind immigration.

Not sure if you know this but the UK's native population has a real issue with producing enough kids. If you rule out immigration what you see is a very unsustainable population. There are not enough native kids being born to keep up with the ever expanding costs of looking after people into their later years. This is a direct result of our good healthcare system and something we should be both proud of and wary of. Look at countries like Germany or Japan where immigration is not so prevalent. They both have real dangers of having a top-heavy demography.

Originally I think the Doctor who she was supposed to meet for the last time was supposed to be later than Matt Smith and an older man.

Or is he saying that he’s no expert, but that in his amateur opinion it’ll be at least 20 years before Cornick is rehabilitated and no longer a danger to the public, and maybe many more years than that?

She asks the judge to predict the future - then attacks him and passively suggests he's an amateur for not knowing how long it might take another human being (and violent murderer) to be rehabilitated. Medical and law experts can do the best they can to know if and how a murderer can rehabilitate - but it's not an exact science. Why does she expect it to be? 

I'd be in favour of a sentence *review* after a period of time. Find out if the offender has changed and adjust accordingly. 

But despite being a child when committing the crime, Cornick took someone else's life deliberately and violently. It was not accidental. A heavy sentence is deserve if only to protect others from him.

Re wages, I wonder how much BR's hands are tied by the ghosts of Roy and Rafa, which has likely scared off FSG from allowing BR to bring in older players on high wages and low fees, who in FSG's experience have been universally shite. See Dempsey for example - in transfer discussions, such players aren't even on the table anymore (save for Lambert, an exception in many ways)...

--*Non-EU migrants were a net cost, about 120billion until 2012.*


The logical conclusion one should draw from this report is that the EU is beneficial to the UK in fiscal terms and that a strict points-based system for non-EU migrants is also essential.

""The analysis showed that “EU 15” migrants contributed 64 per cent more in taxes to the UK than they received in benefits, and the A10 group – comprising countries such as Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia and Lithuania – contributed 12 per cent more than they received.""

Firstly, I know that Scottish universities, and actually quite a few others nowadays, are a lot more flexible than 'we study our chosen subject and only that subject all the way through'.

In my 2nd year of university, I currently have done only 3 modules in my degree subject, politics, whereas ive done 6 in others, including Geography, History and Philosophy. The idea being that in my third year, when I enter 'honours', I have the flexibility of either keeping my original degree subject or perhaps changing my degree entirely to another subject I have been doing 'on the side'.

This is done in most leading universities now.

Secondly, the Russel Group really does not accurately define the top tier of the UK's universities. There are quite obvious omissions - Bath, St Andrews for example, as well as some universities that aren't necessarily of better teaching quality than other, non-Russel Group Universities. 

On top of that, as you quite rightly pointed out, different universities are better for different subjects, disciplines etc. The Russel Group is way too over-simplified - it focuses too much on research and not enough on teaching.

Why would I support the team of a state that I don't want to exist? Surely my support of the football team would be a form of flaccid support of the state? I remember watching a documentary about when the GDR played West Germany in the 74 world cup; The people from the GDR were raging that they beat West Germany because they thought it would give the state a political victory, thus helping to perpetuate its existence. Different scenarios I know but it's the same kind of idea.

That's why I don't support NI. Like how you ignored that though. The bit about Loyalists is just another reason, it doesn't constitute the entirety of my argument just because you say it does. Let's not forget Neil Lennon got death threats for playing for that team not too long ago. 

I apologise for generalising about all NI fans. I see now I was wrong.

They're quite a good representation of the best universities to study certain subjects.

2) Apart from the cultural differences - which, going to a very American-heavy university - I don't think are as bad as people make out to be, there will probably be smaller challenges you might not have thought of before. Mobile phone contracts, healthcare, insurance, accounting, things like that is always a bit tricky if you're a foreign student. That said, there are plenty of resources to help you with these kinds of things and if you're at a well-organised university they'll help you out plenty.

I don't think there are many challenges for an American in the UK, especially if you find a university with a large community of American students. There are a few.

3) You need to look around [UCAS](http://www.ucas.com/how-it-all-works/international) to answer this question. It's a centralised organisation which deals with all university admissions - we have a very clear system here, unlike in the US where you apply individually (and pay individually) to every college you want to go to (I believe?)

4) [Here's your website.](https://www.gov.uk/browse/visas-immigration/student-visas) I wouldn't worry about it too much - obviously as a Brit i've never done it myself but none of my American friends have said they had any major dramas with it.

You can't join the [Youth Hostel Association](http://www.yha.org.uk/) as your abroad, but the YHA recognises the[ Hostelling International](https://www.hihostels.com/?linkid=980019) membership.

B&amp;Bs used to be cheap, but some have got very expensive. In some places it is cheaper to use the budget hotels (Travel Lodge, Premier Inn, IBIS Budget). But of course, your breakfast may not be included in the room prices, so consider that extra cost.

In terms of Travel, train costs vary massively from provider to provider. But I think bus prices are similar across the country. Most Bus and Train providers have some form of single day/multi-day open ticket.

You can get tickets direct at the station, via the train providers website (Northern Rail, Virgin trains, Trans-Pennine etc) or from [National Rail Enquiries](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/) or from the [Train Line](http://www.thetrainline.com/). I believe that both sites offer on-line purchasing for pick up at the station.

As far as cost goes. That could vary quite alot. If you B&amp;B every-night, eating out for your meals, you would likely need somewhere in the order of £1500 to £2000 (2000 to 3000 USD) plus spending money for a month worth of travel.

To make your accommodation cheaper, you can sign up to sites like [Couch Surfing](https://www.couchsurfing.org/) if you don't mind roughing it.

If your considering visiting Northern England, feel free to send me a message, I could suggest numerous places to visit and possibly cheap accommodation.

Chelsea paid 38m for Costa and 33m for Fabregas. Neither of those transfers are even close to the 60m+ you're talking about. 

They can buy these 40m world class players because they have a wage structure that supports it. We could easily afford the transfer fees for a couple of Costa type players, but they'll ask for very high wages, meaning that we'll have to increase the wages of Gerrard, Sturridge and a host of other senior players. At that point we're paying far, far more than the original 40m.

United's situation is nothing like Chelsea's. They bought Di Maria for 75m because they had no CL (hence no player pressure) and were desperate for a marquee signing, so Madrid could bend them over and demand as much as they wanted. They also loaned Falcao on absurd wages with injury concerns.

Chelsea = quality signings in the 40m range that fit their wage structure.

United = quality signings for insane fees and unsustainable wages. They got a massive once-in-a-lifetime tax break of 125m or something crazy when they floated the club that funded this, so it won't happen again. They'll be reliant on CL qualification and a host of other performance objectives to steady the ship after that, while Chelsea will be fine either way.

I think we'll eventually move towards a wage structure that supports these types of players in 4-5 years. At the moment, increasing the wages of Gerrard, Johnson, etc isn't terrific value. If we can hold onto a CL spot until they retire, though, we'll have players like Sturridge and Sterling as the big earners at the club providing good value for money even with a pay increase.

For immigrants that arrived since 2000, contributions have been positive throughout, and particularly so for immigrants from EEA countries.

This gives me an opportunity most don't as I've gotten to experience another country's take on immigration.Over here once you get accepted as an immigrant you get offered SFI. Svensk för Invandrare or Swedish for Immigrants when translated. There you learn the language and about the Swedish culture. They try and teach you how to integrate into society there and thus become a positive member. To me it's such a great system, plus on my course I've met lots of nice people from places like Iran, Syria, Gambia and the like. Was especially interesting during the Scottish referendum as none of them understood why Scotland wanted independence.Where is the equivalent in the UK?Also a better economy wouldn't automatically affect those points. But immigrants that come here do increase the economy but don't always integrate. We're seeing examples of this more and more in the news.A good one would be the wannabe jihadists leaving here to fight against the West. If they were so integrated why do they want to blow us up? And it only takes a few incidents like this to cause the hate that is becoming more and more prevalent.As the indigenous population sees the groups keeping to themselves and not being party of general society this grows and grows and then impacts on society.One example is the Chinese. How many incidents do you hear about from that community? They do keep to themselves at times but are usually quote integrated into the UK, with the Chinese New Year festivals and parties. And as such you hear very little hate towards them. Have you never wondered why that is?My best friend is of Chinese origin, my parents have been invited to so many events held by the Chinese community in my home town of Barnsley, usually at the town hall.

The last time we were involved in regime change by invasion was 1945; our troops stayed for decades. Also, though the government was changed, the police and other infrastructure was left largely intact (even though it meant leaving former regime members with power).

That worked quite well, over two decades. In Iraq, we went in and then decided to scarper as soon as victory was declared, more or less. The country has predictably gone to shit because we never had a plan of occupation, let alone enough troops to do so even if there had been a plan.

Founded a company while there, now growing at 8 digit valuations and getting stronger. Already employing lots of highly educated Brits etc.

Now would I have been keen to deal with a border drilling me all sorts of demeaning questions as if I would come to slum for fucking benefits? Probably not. I mean it's not huge, but the decision to found the company in the UK was a close one and came down to the fact that I loved living in Oxfordshire at the time. The border annoyance might have chased me off.

It has been shown several times that it yields a significant net economic gain across the country on average.  This IS accounting for an increased use of public services.  The only people who MAYBE have something economically to complain about are people from working class areas in which there is increased competition for low skilled jobs.  Now I am from such an area and I am of the strong belief, having lived there for 18 years, that this is a problem with overall Government policy, particularly when it comes to welfare, and NOT immigration.

This is precisely why you don't hear the economic argument from UKIP anymore.  ""Muh welfare state"" and ""muh strain on public services"" has given way to ""muh British values"" and ""muh integration.""  Now I very much believe that the vast majority of arguments along this vein are indicative of deeply rooted ignorance.  The only reason the cultural argument remains is because it is incredibly subjective and near impossible to prove one way or the other.  Now, if people were given a sense of perspective and overall numbers, rather than being repeatedly spoon narrow statistics, then I think such cultural arguments would go away.  

Every time I go home, I see people campaigning for help for heroes yet no one questioning Government foreign policy.   I see people complaining about their taxes funding  ""scroungers"" down the road yet no one questions how much.  I see people moan about immigrants taking their jobs yet they have not been in employment in the past 20 years.  It is a complete lack of perspective.

If he hadn't basically won them a title it would have been a massive waste of money.

On the other hand if you buy a promising 20 year old for £8m, then in four or five years you've either got a good player worth maybe two or three times as much (Coutinho), or you've got a slight dud who is still probably worth £4-5m just in inherent value. 

Their plan is about building a club and a team which is sustainable and functions with low risk exposure, whilst buying players like Zlatan is very high-risk because any player around 30 or older is going to depreciate massively each season - either they win you some trophies or you've spent tens of millions you'll never see again.

Instead something quite amazing happened. When public services and benefits started to be cut and wages remained stagnant it wasn't the government that was blamed, it was the immigrants.

We're buying youngsters not because we think it'll work now, but because it's the only way we can get world class talent in the prime of their years. It just means we have to wait until they get there.

That's a problem now but if we're clever for the next 5 years until players like Sterling, Markovic, Can and Origi are established then we'll have a team that can actually compete with reinforcements generally not being signed the summer we need them, but years beforehand and trickling into the first team.

A nit-pick; Reus isn't a prospect - he's an established international, accomplished goalscorer and world class footballer. If he didn't have a buyout clause he'd be going for 60m+ when he does eventually leave Dortmund.

At this stage it looks like our squad will only get younger again with Toure and Lucas probably going in the summer, so I think its imperative that we sign some more experienced players. Overall I still think the most important person in the club is Rodgers and we should give him the time and resources to succeed which Rafa didn't get at the end of his tenure when he could have taken us to the next level.

Everyone had figured out their roles and what they needed to bring to the table. When we lost Suarez (and then Sturridge) it shifted everyone's roles. You hear Rodgers saying he wants 10 goals from Hendo. You can tell Coutinho is approaching the season like he'll need to be more influential. It basically put weight on players in areas that even on their best days they might not have been able to carry. 

We need to find our identity again. With so many new people that's twice as hard. 

But I think the thing about how close we came last year is that it forced Gerrard to reach a new level in a way. There was a sense that what the club was fighting for was bigger than just a trophy or bragging rights. It was for Gerrard. After his slip and Henderson's red card I think we really lost our nerve. 

For all the talk of our in-house sports psychologist, I'd say one of the most pressing things this year is the confidence of a number of players. Sterling, Coutinho, Allen, Borini, Balotelli, among others are quite obviously in their heads. They aren't being instinctive, they're questioning themselves.

You can say all you want about Allen and Borini, but they just don't have the end product to be starters for a CL team. And frankly, they don't even have the end product to be reliable off the bench unless we're using them as bodies in matches we should already be winning. 

There are too many fans here who don't realize that the sides winning the league and going far into the CL are not holding onto players for vague reasons like they ""lend balance"" or ""work hard"". Every player performs some function that is vital in their victories. If you look at where Joe Allen has played on the pitch you cannot argue that we don't need someone there who is at least capable of making something happen in the final third. 

Can has played only a handful of matches for us and he has already assembled as many good to very good moments as Joe Allen has in his whole time at the club.

Sure, if you ignore the evidence.

-    100% of workers are paid above the government-mandated minimum wage and all workers are paid according to their skills and years of service.

-    The standard working week is 45 hours, and workers are compensated (at a higher rate of pay) for any overtime worked.

-    There is a high retention of staff and employees are offered training and development.
   
-    An audit into the CMT factory was carried out in October 2014 by an independent not-for-profit organisation and this did not reveal any material concerns on the working conditions, the welfare or the health and safety of workers.

-    Workers are able to join a union and there is a union presence in the factory.

&gt;I'm not advocating Allardyce's (old) approach, but I think we can definitely use more proven, experience alongside Gerrard and Toure, and we shouldn't shy from spending that on a storied defender and/or midfielder in January.

Wholeheartedly agree with this.  I still rate the signing of Gary McAllister, at 36, as one of our most shrewd.  He came in for a season and just knitted it all together.  Similarly, I think Bayern made a wonder move with Xabi, and thought that before he'd played a game for them.  Juventus did this with Pirlo too.  I don't have a suggestion of who this is for us mind.

I have a pessimistic feeling this wouldn't have happened before yesterday, though...

&gt;Toure is still quality at 33 and I would gladly have him develop a partnership with Sakho. Sakho (24) is still relatively young for a CB, as is Lovren (25), so in my view, they need an experienced partner like Toure or Skrtel. Toure is perfect for now given his experience and quality, but he may need to be replaced in the future.

Could you imagine how much we'd be struggling right now if we'd kept Suarez and had to get through his 4 month ban with last season's squad while Sturridge was also out injured? It would be no different if we had Costa, or Falcao or Sanchez - a team that can maybe finish 2nd if he's fit all season but if he has any lengthy injury we're scraping the barrel for cover. Sure we're playing like shit right now but at least we've got five or six new players in who will hopefully start to come good once they've spent a bit more time together. 

A replacement to Suarez would have been good, but what we really needed over the summer was to extend our first team past the 12 or 13 players we had.

Chelsea have Drogba, Terry and Cech. Think about how storied those three names are. They specifically brought back Drogba, Mou brought Terry back into the starting XI. Cech is reserve keeper now, but this is an exception. He is behind the best young goalkeeper (by a country mile) in the world right now. Terry is a sure starter. Drogba and Cech would start for most teams.

City brought in Lampard (36) and Pellegrini said he'd gladly take Gerrard at age 34. Demichelis is 33, Toure and Sagna (brought in this season on a free) are 31. Toure and Demichelis are starting XI. Sagna would be for most teams.  

United have Carrick (31) and Van Persie (33) after losing loads of experience very quickly in Scholes, Ferdinand, Vidic, Evra, and Giggs. See what good it's done them losing that much experience so quickly. They have so many top players, but lack that experienced core. Rooney is 29, Falcao is 28, Di Maria is 26 - their three other most experienced players. With Carrick injured, United can only use RvP as an older more experienced player.

On what basis? On the assumption that the clubs they play for were willing to sell them for an acceptable amount of money? On the assumption that the player would actually want to come to us? On the basis of their current performance not being over-hyped, not being one-season wonders, and actually transferring to the Premier League?

Do you remember when we signed an absolute goal-machine from Feyenoord, who had average of over 25 goals a season across four seasons? And then we ended up with Dirk Kuyt, who was a fantastically industrious player for us and a great signing, but at the same time never came even close to 25 goals in a Premier League season.

It's obvious that BR isn't trying to build a squad that can win or perhaps even challenge for the title this season - he's trying to build one that will challenge for several years in a row in a few years' time. In that sense signings like Balotelli are decent, because for £16m he's unlikely to really drop in value much even if he's a bit of a flop, because he'll still be Balotelli and there'll still be someone looking to buy him for £15-20m in the future.

On the other hand if we go out and chuck £40m on some 27 year old, then best case scenario they're starting to get past it when the likes of Coutinho, Sterling, Henderson all mature to their peak level. And worse case scenario you get what Chelsea had with Torres, we had with Carroll and Spurs had with Soldaldo (who was on 25-30 goals a season before he went to Spurs, and I'm sure would be a ""Suarez replacement"" if we were looking a year ago) where you've spent a huge chunk of money on a player who does nothing for you and is worth hardly anything to sell on. 

The strategy is long-term and low-risk, which also means it tends to be low-return in the short-term. But that just seems to be how FSG want to play it. The average age of our squad right now is already incredibly young, and we spent most of our transfer efforts in the summer making it even younger. Whether what BR is doing is the *right* thing, I think it's way too early to tell, but I think it's pretty obvious he has a plan.
