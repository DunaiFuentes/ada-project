Granted, Lamela and Soldado have been massively overpriced disappointments, but they reflect an underlying issue; we cannot guarentee champions league football and we have comparatively limited funds, so must take gambles which don't always pay off straight away. I'm sure if given time and effort, their investments will start to pay off.

In retrospect, sacking AVB was a foolish move which could have been avoided by a clear and unequivocal backing by Levy that he would remain until the end of the season. Sherwood has done as well as can reasonably be expected by a man with no managerial experiance and should either be backed significantly or sacked.

Watching this team play together has been my favourite time as a Saints fan; youthful, energetic, attacking, possession, fluidity of play can just be something to behold. Some of the interlinking play we get between players, especially Lambert, Lallana and Rodriguez when they were working so well together, was just a joy to see as a Saints fan because we've not had that type of play in my memory, and it tore defenses up sometimes, it was just great.

As for the actual result, second season in the PL and finishing 8th, the top of the table is good enough, the top of the rest just showed how well we did. Although they didn't have a good season, finishing below Man U is not something I thought would happen any time soon, and we were close to European football level of points, which for me is a good goal to aim for, and possibly the best in the next 3(ish) seasons we could get. I'd love a European night out again though, especially as I feel we'd do better this time than our last venture.

Obviously all the worry now is that by being the best of the rest, we now have the undeniable and well documented fun of watching every player in our squad be linked with moves elsewhere, and also every fan of every top 7 team in /r/soccer being positive our players are already as good as gone. It's all about keeping this team together now, which is all dependent on Poch getting the backing he wants I think, and I feel like anything short of a 5 year plan to turn Saints into a Champions League squad might not convince him of the ""project"". Depending on how long the talks take that start on Monday we may know relatively soon about the plan, and therefore whether we have a summer to look forward to, keeping our players, investing and pushing on.... or whether at least 1 of our stars is going to go, and possibly more.

I still don't know what to think in regards to certain players leaving, I can understand the reasons why (especially) Lallana and Shaw, maybe Schniederlin etc might leave, but I honestly think they'd stay if Poch did with the plan of eventually getting CL football. And I'd sincerely, honestly and truly, love for us to just once be able to keep one of our own damn youth players when they start getting noticed, and believe with about 2 - 3 seasons of Â£30m - Â£50m of investment in our squad, and keeping our key players, we could manage to at least pose a threat to CL spots, something like the building Everton have had for the last few seasons, until we at least can be considered as a ""top"" team ourselves.",0,1399843170,null,0,false,0,chfffm5,t3_25ag7d,t1_chfffm5,t3_25ag7d,null,1433752409,10,false,SaintsFC,t5_2tboa,10

true,Darneil,,Protein shake to go.,"Yo, Red Lioners. I actually know something about all this. Big F1 the past few years. Feel free to ask questions but i'll answer this basic topic ELI5 style.

The old engines, the high pitched ones, were V8. There's been a steady decline in engine, from V12, to V10, to V8 and now to a V6 Turbo. The ""hoover"" sound is the turbo in action. It's a very different sound, but honestly, most avid fans are used to it by now. It's even pleasant in its own way. It's more like a real engine. And, despite how it might seem, it's faster. Compared to the old engines, the new ones use an ERS, Energy Recovery System, to recycle airflow back through the engine and turbo to get greater power. Somewhere in the region of 150 extra horsepower over last year.

As for ""level playing field""... it's debatable. These changes are to be more ""green"", but many have argued F1 isn't about being green, but about pushing speed and mechanics to the maximum. I agree mostly. But that direction (If that is the direction, and it's not just hiding *another* form of corruption or something) has led to other changes, like cars only being allowed 100kg of fuel per race, limited numbers of tyres, engines, etc. 

Mercedes are dominating. Their engine was the only engine to, from the start, adapt to the changes brilliantly. The Renault and Ferrari engines struggled heavily at the start of the season, with a lot of jokes that we'd end up with half the cars breaking down halfway through. First race of the season, only 13 cars of 22 finished, actually. But it's gotten a lot better now. Red Bull (Vettel and Riccardo) are back on form, Ferrari have picked up pace, and the fact that Williams were on a Mercedes engine let them *reaaaally* get a good start compared to their shoddy performance last year. Even then, Mercedes hit the ground running so well that they still have over 3x the points of any other team. Every race has been a Mercedes pole, and even a 1/2 finish except the first race (Hamilton's car broke down.)

People with dietary requirements get sick if they eat the wrong thing - sometimes they die. This is nothing like that.

It's a religious dietary requirement, you're not saying anything insightful here, I didn't say it was a health requirement.

&gt;Where did you read that and can you cite it please?

[It's actually 85%](http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/sep/25/halal-food-why-hard-find-britain) 

&gt;I could turn this sentence around and say it right back to any Muslim demanding their Halal meat, couldn't I.
&gt;Fact is you respect what they choose to believe - you don't respect what I choose to believe.

I don't think you've understood anything here. 85% of meat sold in this country isn't halal, so you've got plenty of choice of non-halal meat *if that's what you choose*. Similarly Muslims can buy/consume halal meat *as the choice exists for them*. Businesses are free to tap into the halal market *if they choose to* or buy halal meat if it is cheaper for them. 

You seem to think that you're somehow being oppressed by the existence of these choices by both businesses and consumers. You do realise you don't have to order chicken pizzas from Pizza Express if you don't want to? Nor do you have to buy meat curries from curry houses, meat/chicken from independent fast food shops or kebabs from kebab houses. If you don't want to eat halal meat, you don't have to - plenty of people don't.",0,1399843574,null,0,false,0,chfflh7,t3_25a4rj,t1_chfflh7,t1_chfaoxl,null,1433752487,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Januzaj is a star. Welbeck isn't too shabby himself either. What Man U lacks is a central midfielder. The same thing they lacked last season. Fellaini was a mistake, he is the not type of player that fits Man U. Which obviously comes back to Moyes.

His vision and passing skill was evident when juxtaposed with Chiriches, Dawson, and Veljkovic in the last 20 mins today in which nobody except for Bentaleb could get the ball out of our third. Bentaleb is the kind of guy who can be played alongside Sandro in a B2B role or alongside Paulinho as a holder. He could even be played behind Eriksen, Holtby, Sigurdsson, Chadli, etc as a lone defensive midfielder. I know you don't consider him a DM, but his skillset and versatility make him an easy pick to put in the middle of the park with a more specialized (attacking or defending) midfielder. He can pick up the slack of whatever the other lets down.

I agree that it would be a big mistake to loan out Bentaleb. This season Dembele, Sandro, and Capoue have spent extended periods injured.

De Guzman - price could be an issue but how long is left on his contract now? Surely must be in his penultimate year at Villarreal? Could drive the price down. A lot of people are skeptical of him, but I think his spell on the wing has been a welcome change.

And if we don't sign JDG...

Sigurdsson - Monk knows him from his time here before, never getting a good run in the Spurs team, wages could be an issue.

The mentions of Jonny Williams and Fabio Borini I'd also welcome with open arms.

OUT:

Lita - baffling signing, never showed enough for us

Pozuelo - I like Pozuelo, but he doesn't seem like he'll get a look in now. A little too flimsy for this league IMO.

I like Andreu Fontas to fill that position, but he might not be available.  He just moved to Celta Vigo last season, but is only 24, inexpensive, and Spanish.

On the other side of things, Tiendalli and N'Gog should go. With N'Gog, I get that we don't have a legitimate backup for Bony, but he doesn't belong. Another loaned forward like Emnes would work as a replacement, or perhaps we should just try for Emnes permanently.

**Capitalism** - Where your prize depends on how well you've done in the race, so everyone takes part and runs as fast as they can.

**Socialism** - Like Capitalism, except where you don't have to take part or put in much effort, in order to get a decent prize because everybody is forced to give some of their prize to the losers. 

Some people might not put in much effort or take part in the race because they're either content with the smaller prize, or they know they won't win a prize that's much better anyway, or at least a prize that's worth the extra effort. They'll probably decide focus their effort on trying to bully the biggest winners for a larger portion of their prize, instead.


**Communism** - Where everybody (as long as they took part) gets the same prize, so everybody just walks the race.

It reeks of arrogance that people think they are entitled to luxuries when they are not willing to work for them.   

Minimum wage is for jobs which require pretty much nothing from you, you want to be paid more, do something to make yourself valuable to an employer and you'll find you're able to. 

My job for example pays minimum wage (I'm a care assistant). I needed no qualifications at all to get the job other than proof (via a CRB) that I haven't abused vulnerable adults or children. There is no educational requirements (and some of the people I work with are truly stupid) but there is the opportunity for me to better myself doing it. If I stick around long enough my experience will earn me a pay rise, If I complete a level 2 NVQ in care then I'll get another pay rise and a level 3 NVQ will get me yet another pay rise and a promotion to senior level. 

TL;DR If I work to make my self better I will be paid more, until then I can afford to pay rent, gas+electricty, water, internet, food and the occasional night out on minimum wage, I even save some of it.

As a caveat, I'm ignoring the transfer fee speculation because A. it's not my money and B. I'm not going to be privy to the negotiations anyway. So the only question I care about is, ""Would Luke Shaw be a good fit for Liverpool?""

I think he would.

With the talent he's showing at his age, there's a ton of upside to picking him up. Even if his transfer fee is a little high, like 30m or so, he could be a player who lines up for Liverpool for 10 years or more. Look at Henderson- a player who people were crowing about us overpaying for as recently as this season, is now an indispensable part of the team, and could potentially be captain one day.

Luke Shaw is quick, has remarkable decision-making qualities for an 18 year old, and is a vanishingly rare breed of attacking fullback who can still, you know, *defend*. 

One argument I hear for why he wouldn't work is that service into the box is a significant part of his game, and it wouldn't fit in a team that focuses on quick passes and playing through the middle. To that I say: A. he could learn to play our way, and B. I think it's worth having his particular trick available. We've had a hard time breaking down teams who bunker down and deny us the space to play through the center and find that killer pass, because we don't really have a back up plan. Shaw could give us, if not an ace up the sleeve, then at least an extra tool on the utility belt.

Luke Shaw could be a flop, or at least not as good as advertised. OR, he could be the next Gareth Bale. 

The worst that can happen is the club spends money on a player that doesn't pan out. That happens in football. It's the nature of the business. I respect that a lot of Liverpool fans are wary of spending money on a player that doesn't meet certain criteria because they don't want another Andy Carroll or Stewart Downing, but, with all due respect and affection, they need to chill the fuck out and have faith in the manager.",0,1399850103,null,0,false,0,chfi4oe,t3_25aye0,t1_chfi4oe,t3_25aye0,null,1433753750,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Rich people would earn less because their companies would need to pay higher wages and therefore lower dividends, however that would be balanced out by them having to pay virtually no tax.

The poor would also be no better or worse off, they would be being paid a lot more but their tax would be (massively) increased.

So why bother you may ask?

Levy has the unfortunate habit of costing Spurs in the long term by saving them money in the short term.

Levy put us in the position we are in today by only bringing in Ryan Nelsen and Louis Saha in the January 2012 transfer window. On January 31st, we were in 3rd, 7 points clear of Chelsea and 13 points clear of Arsenal. Instead of bringing in actual players who could help the team, Levy cheaped out with two free transfers. As everyone probably knows, Chelsea won the CL, and the PL season ended with Arsenal 1 point ahead of us, and even on goal differential. One goal could have secured 3rd place. Instead, 4th place got Europa League.

As a result of missing out on Champions League, Modric left for Real Madrid. When it came time to find his replacement, Levy fucked up the deal with Porto for Moutinho by haggling over an amount that was less than 10% of the total transfer fee. The deal didn't get done by midnight, and Spurs are still looking today for a true central midfield playmaker. (Footnote: Haggling cost us Benteke, and we ended up with Soldado. Great choice there Levy)

After Modric left, the plan changed to building around Bale. No player signed after Modric left was older than 25. The plan was to build a squad that could compete for the PL title when those players hit their prime in 2-3 years. In January 2013, we were in 4th place, 4 points clear of Arsenal. In the January window, we brought in Holtby (essentially on a free) and Fryers. Neither were the players we needed, and Bale was forced to continue carrying the team. Once Kyle Walker made that incredibly, incredibly stupid (seriously, so dumb) backpass at Liverpool, the season was essentially over. We finished 5th, 1 point behind Arsenal.

Then, last summer, Levy capitulated to Real Madrid and sold Bale. This move set Tottenham back 20 years. Bale is the 3rd best player in the world. Bale would be irreplaceable for any team, but even moreso for a team like Tottenham, who refuse to/can't pay the wages a World Top 10 player demands. As you saw, even with the money from the Bale sale, we couldn't find players to properly replace him. Oh, and if you've been wondering why Paulinho has been such a fuckhead all season? In an interview before his transfer was official, he talked about how excited he was to move to England and play with Bale, who he said was staying. He was recruited with the promise of playing with a superstar, only to have the player sold before he arrived to the team. Bale's departure has been detrimental to the team, not only competitively, but in regards to locker room morale as well. Bale's departure has had the exact opposite effect on the locker room (and the fans for that matter) that Ozil's transfer to Arsenal had.

Lets take your point that the 30% is taken away from the rich and given to the poor and combine it with the ""everyone gets paid at least Â£35k"" (I'm not sure how you think this is remotely possible mathematically but I'll humour you).

What we (the hypothetical government) would have under the current system is Â£35k tax income, if we change it to your system it immediately drops down to Â£25k after the personal allowance is removed, we then take 20% of the first Â£22k and then 40% of the remaining Â£3k. This gives us a final income tax of Â£5.6k.

We started with Â£35k income, applied your system and now have Â£5.6k, that's an 84% reduction. 

On top of that all these top 1% are still paying the top tax rate but on less income (since you took it all away to give it to the minimum wage workers) so they're still angry and still leave, taking their corporate headquarters with them so we still end up fucked economy-wise. 

Now to another flaw in your plan, Â£35k for all the minimum wage earners? I'm assuming we'll also take the above minimum wage (but under Â£35k) earners up to Â£35k too? Now we have the problem were well qualified people and people with no qualifications are competing for jobs in the same income bracket, teachers and street sweepers for example, now the teachers are pissed off and demand more money, chain reaction all the way up the system until we end up having to make more money. If we're lucky we end up with Â£35k being the ""new"" Â£12k, with the cost of everything to match, minimum wage went up 290% and so did the price of milk, if we're unlucky (and we probably are) we end up with something called hyperinflation, which hasn't worked out so well in the past.

You can see the artifacting around the letters - I'm guessing that you made the sign larger than it was when you originally downloaded it.

It's not a bad Photoshop, but there are a few things I would clean up. The edges are mostly clean, you beveled his hair at the top, left a line tool extension down his right arm, and you missed erasing some of the blue background fill on his right arm and left shoulder.

""take 20% of the first Â£22k and then 40% of the remaining Â£3k""

No, the entire point is no one is paying a % of their income in tax anymore, that is what I'm trying to get away from. Everyone in employment (pro-rate for part time) would pay a fixed amount so that the total adds up to what everyone added together currently pays.

The idea is to rebalance salaries/dividends so that everyone is, after paying that fixed amount of tax, still earning the same amount (except those people that were previously avoiding/evading tax, tough shit for them).

Yes, some industries would be winners and some losers, but why should one industry have to subsidise another? If you have a good answer to that then a subsidy system could still be added at the company level, not the employee level.

Â£35k was just a response to the person that said that was what the minimum would need to be, to me the exact number doesn't matter, it just needs to result in everyone earning the same as they do now after the new fixed amount tax.",0,1399853379,null,0,false,0,chfjdpo,t3_259mdb,t1_chfjdpo,t1_chfj2j9,null,1433754334,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Whereas Sandro actually did a lot more than that today.

I agreed with the part about ""looking deeper and building a future for a football club.""  But ""never burning bridges with a player""?  That's both a dig at AVB and arguably a rather hypocritical statement (depending on your view of the Capoue, Holtby, and Lamela situations).

true,Mulian,null,null,"&gt;How does having money make you inherently more powerful? If I have Â£1 billion but I never spend on ""power"" then I am no more or less powerful than any average man on the street. 

It's not just how you spend it, it's how you acquired it in the first place. Do you pay the wages of thousands of other people? Then you can choose not to. You can make millions from interest, not lifting a finger. At some point, your wealth becomes an institution.

&gt;Again not sure how you came to this conclusion. If I'm loaded and you aren't, I don't see how that's harming your freedom.

Wealth is heavily tied to freedom in this society. If you have enough money, you can buy whatever you want, you can go wherever you want, you can talk to whoever you want. You can buy citizenship of any country you want. You can eat whatever you want, you can sleep with (almost) whoever you want. It is not difficult to equate that with greater liberty; and liberty is interchangeable with power. Yet at some point, the dynamic of financial freedom turns from purely self-empowering, to having power over others.  A lack of, or significant inequality of wealth, leads to a lack of freedom. You are not free at all, if you don't have bread on the table -- you can't think freely, you can't exist, without the spectre of hunger dominating your very existence. You are less free to act if you don't have the money to travel where you want. Freedom comes in degrees, going from absolutely no freedom (slave), to near-absolute (god). The healthy spot lies somewhere in-between those two extremes. Enough freedom to act and think for yourself, but not enough to adversely affect others.

It matters not whether *you* use your fortune in a benign way, it's the potential use of so much money, the same as the potential of a gun; except a fortune is much more potent than a single weapon. Legally, you can buy the loyalty of the best lawyers to successfully overturn any court case against you; you can sue less wealthy people into bankruptcy ;you can put your employees out of a job if you're not happy with their work - taking away their basic freedoms to act as they would like, at least until they find a new job (if they do);you can buy a media company to influence the results of an election or referendum, thus impinging on the agency of others.  Less legally, you can ask for favours from people who make the laws - for instance, a law which takes away the rights of workers, or maybe outlaws gay marriage. You can employ people to ruin another person's reputation. The system is pretty much slanted in your favour. 

Inequality of liberty leads to inequality of power. And unequal power can be used to take away the freedom of others. ",0,1399856223,null,0,1399856859,0,chfkhld,t3_259mdb,t1_chfkhld,t1_chfj9ch,null,1433754856,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

What's pertinent aside from the issue of Scottish independence is the state the NHS is being run into.  When she talks about a hospital deciding it won't do gullet operations because they're unprofitable this is what happens every time a core service is taken over by the private sector.

If your country is not listed just drop us an e-mail and we will add it.  
Please Note: any import taxes are the duty of the customer to pay if and where applicable.

While that applies to orders sent abroad, it does mean that they will accept payment from the US- although they apparently don't accept American Express- Visa and Mastercard are fine.

If you stepped into managing City, you would probably play the same personnel every game, but tweak roles, positions, and formation. I think Tim may have been right when he said he didn't know who his best XI were. That may be because he's inexperienced, but it may also be because this team still doesn't have a lot of history together.  I think he stuck with Lennon and Bentaleb too long, but he had a lot of injuries and probably felt like experimenting with some stability may pay some dividends. 

I also think he's a polarizing, but popular figure. I mean, who wants another boring ass Arsene Wenger?  He's witty and personable. He shifts responsibility, and is really hypocritical but never short on sound bites.

Police deployment is controlled by police staff, police do not generally turn up to anything civil because it's not our area, so why in this case?

There is virtually no chance that the police actually researched the address and contact details of this dude from his twitter account. Those staff members are rushed off their feet as it is without having to hunt down peoples twitter accounts then research addresses etc for that name for civil disputes.

I'd guess that the reporting person was responsible for that and probably knew just what to say to the call handler to actually create a job for this complaint. Technically this should not really have happened as staff and their supervisors do review jobs and try to not resource the ones that are blatantly not a police matter, so there would be something in the initial report that made them attend.

They fucked up big time in my opinion (although i'm prejudiced because I hate ukip) when they asked him to take down the image. That's not on, but at least they clarified that they had no legal power to ask him to anyway.

I hope he does make a complaint, not about the officers individually but just a complaint that police were actually sent out to visit him over something that is completely legal and a civil matter. It is frustrating to be honest, police officers cannot be involved in politics I can't openly support a party because we do need to be impartial.

I've been supporting Everton for a short time (maybe 5 years now?) but this season I watched the most games I ever have - I maybe missed two games (one being when we lost to Sunderland when Howard got the red card and I couldn't fathom wtf had happened!) I've grown to love Everton even more and have so many memorable moments. My absolute favorite moment was Barkley's goal vs Norwich - that absolute screamer he scored outside the box with his opposite foot. That moment gave me goosebumps for the first time in the short amount of time I've been watching footy.

We should sell Vellios...There aren't many I can think of off the top of my head, but it pains me to say maybe it's time for Pienaar to go? Or at least play a more fringe role? Can McGeady play on the left? I think McGeady and Coleman's blistering speed cancel out each other sometimes haha!

I don't want to be pessimistic, but it will be very difficult to get a top 4 spot with all the changes Man United and Tottenham should be making in the summer. With that being said, I really hope we give our all and make our way to Champions League by winning the Europa league! I really think we've got the talent, and I'm excited to see how competitive we are in Europe.

The issue you'll run into, especially while enjoying panel shows, is that unless you live in England, or pay very close attention to the news there, you'll miss out on a lot. For the most part, they are topical, and very UK centric. Jokes about Jordan's Down's syndrome child might fly over your head without knowing her, her cage fighting husband... Same with some of the other characters. You get to know David Mitchell as Mark from Peep Show, and that is basically his onscreen persona in everything else. I'm not saying it will stop you enjoying these things, but you can get more out of it if you immerse yourself. Have I Got News for You would make my list, but again, that is very heavily UK news oriented, so if you don't know which MP got caught in an expenses scandal over some Hobnobs and a toilet seat, you'll miss a lot of the context for the jokes.


And I can't stand the uneducated. If you like it, immerse yourself. The Thick of It's Malcolm Tucker is loosely based on Tony Blair's Spin doctor, Alastair Campbell. So if you don't know why he was in the news or famous, a lot of the actual social/political commentary will be lost on you.

- Â£1.2million paid for every place a club finishes in the league, up to Â£24million for the champions.

- facility fees of Â£750,000 for every time a club appears on a live TV match, with a minimum of Â£7.5million.

- equal share from domestic broadcast deals - not yet confirmed but expected to be around 60% increase to Â£23million per club.

- equal share from overseas broadcast deals - not yet confirmed but expected to be around 70% increase to Â£32million per club.

Â£21.6m for 3rd place. Add Â£7.5 for the facility fee, Â£23m domestic deals, Â£32m for the overseas tv deals and you get about Â£84m. And from my calculations, we earned about Â£22m from being a CL semi-finalist. [Source^2](http://www.sportrichlist.com/articles/uefa-champions-league-prize-money-distribution/) So we have Â£106m in prize money and tv deals alone. Where the other Â£234m comes from, I don't know. Tickets, merchandise, sponsorships and property revenue I imagine comes into this. I don't even know how much we earned on the facility fee, I just used the minimum value.

I explained in another thread, why I don't exactly consider this seasons a success, so I won't rehash that here, but I think you are setting the bar a bit low for a ""pretty good season"".

&gt; We reached the semi-finals of the Champions League

I agree here. I think had we made it to the final we would have been overachieving, but going out earlier would have been disappointing. I always expected to get to the quarters or the semis this year.

&gt;We complied with the FFP rules

Should be a given. I don't consider following the rules a success personally.

&gt;We didn't lose a single match against the top 4 teams+Manchester United (including beating our strongest neighbors 6-0 and 4-0)

That's nice, but all points are equal. Thrashing Arsenal may have given us a new song to sing, but I would gladly have lost that game if it meant would could have beaten the relegation teams last month.

&gt;Hazard won the PFA young player of the year

That is nice, but in my mind, individual awards don't really affect my view of our club season. Regardless, I'm glad for him.

&gt;Cech won the Golden Glove

Unlike Hazard's I think this says something about our club. It shows how much we shored up our defense. Very happy to see us getting back to our old ways.

&gt; We finished 3rd,avoiding that pesky CL play-off match

Yea, I'm glad we finished there, but anything less would have been a failure. I mean, objectively looking at the squads of all the other teams, I can't name another team who should be finishing above us. On paper, City and 'Pool have better attacks, but I think we are at least on par or better than in attack and our defense was the strongest in the league. Any other team finishing above us would have been a disappointment. We finished about where I expected we would.

&gt;We finished higher than all our London neighbors

Same point as above. We are better than them. Finishing below them would have been a massive failure. Maybe it's just me, but beating people I'm better than just doesn't feel like a huge victory to me.

I think we put in a solid C performance this season and that's fine, it happens some seasons. We have a new manager and an mix-matched squad. I don't think we should be disappointed by our season, but let's not pretend our shit don't stink. In 20 years I'm not going to be telling my kids about how I remember exactly where I was when I found out Chelsea complied with the FFP rules in 2014. We did what we needed to do and not much more.

In:

* Emnes - By far the best of the loanees. Looked busy and made himself space when he played.
* DeGuzman if the price is right.
* Right Back - If Spurs go on a spending spree then I think Kyle Naughton could do a job? Rangel's lack of pace showed at times this season.

* Winger - Redmond, Assaidi on loan, Albrighton's contract is up at Villa.
* Bring Ki back as cover for Britton.


Controversial:

* Chico has been very good, but I think Bartley could step up in his place. Alternatively, I thought Caulker was great for the Red Dragons and I'd like to see him back in the right colour shirt.

I think Emnes has earned a permanent transfer here in the second loan spell. His contributions to the wins away at Newcastle and home against Villa were critical in the bid for getting safe early on. He drew two penalties, one in each of those games, setting up Bony goals and he netted one for himself today. Plus, that flow is undeniable. There is a lot of quality that will need to be offloaded from these relegated sides. There's no real interest for anyone Cardiff's got though. There are a few Norwich players that I could see at Swansea though. In terms of players going out, I wouldn't be surprised to see both Pozuelo and CaÃ±as leave South Wales this summer, they clearly aren't a part of Monk's game plan as I don't think either has been utilized since he took over. Looking forward to next season, I think any improvement would be great. Maybe set a goal for 50 points in the league. More than anything I'd just like to see some more consistency. Stringing wins together isn't something the squad was able to do at all this season and I feel like it can bring a lot more confidence to a squad.

You're totally correct in that ""Haters gonna hate"" is truer in art than other fields, but that really isn't what's happening in this thread.

You presented your piece as something you ""digitally painted"" which was a half truth. Many people are being hyper-critical because they feel it was disingenuous. 

People are now pointing out each part of the artwork that *wasn't* painted and you're throwing around as many artsy-fartsy buzzwords as you can with the most ungracious, sarcastic tone possible.

I agree with you that this isn't a ""photoshopped"" piece. I edited one of my previous comments to reflect that. But to imply that it's a painting is *also* false.

It's not hand painted and there are a bunch of mistakes that someone who's a beginner in photoshop would make. That isn't ""hatred"", that's legitimate criticism.

Also, a bit of a nitpick but if you really did ""look up what the font used was, found the consensus was Gill Sans, creat font layers and positioned them, rendered them to a manipulative layer over a background color and then blended it in with a smudge tool and applied a filter to create the brush stroke effects"" then I'll eat my own foot.

If I had to guess, you found a picture of the police call box sign, copied and pasted it, positioned it in place, used a magic wand tool or a lasso tool to select certain parts and used a paint bucket to paint it all in. 

The lettering is crisp and doesn't look *anything* like a smudge tool has touched it. The color of the sign itself is completely flat with no ""brushstrokes"" at all. And the edge of the sign stands out against everything else as if it's been pasted on top of it all.

It's a great piece. Very fun.

But you're having a bit of a meltdown. Stop being hypersensitive and for the love of god stop trying to obfuscate your methods.

-De Guzman permanently. He was pivotal in keeping us afloat this season, absolutely prolific player at times.

-A Centre Back. I'll go into it more in the sold portion, but I feel Chico is a liability. I haven't looked much into the possible signings there yet. Someone to consider is Sergi Gomez in Barca B. He's strong, understands possession football, but not quite Barca quality. He's only valued around 1 mil too.

-Striker. Doesn't have to be a Bony or Michu, just someone with a pulse. Vasquez and Shecter were both horrific and Im not sure Rory is ready for premier league play yet.

-Bony. This one is about keeping him. When someone puts up a season like he has you have to expect some knocks on the door. I think our season rests on keeping him.

Sold:

-Tiendelli, Ngog, Lita. Tiendelli is shit. Ngog non existent. Lita just not quite good enough.

-Lamah. I quite like his pace, however if someone offers the right price, he is quite expendable, especially with the amount of talented wingers out there.

-Chico. He's talented for sure, but he will have at least one asinine error per game and he seems to be an absolute head case. When he maraudes up the field acting like he's Maradona and takes some shitty shot I want to pull my hair out. Additionally, he's talented enough that I could see a team like West Ham pitching some solid cash for him.

Expectations:

-If Monk pulls off a decent offseason, without the stress of European football I think we could make the top half of the table. Our goal should be top 10.

&gt;

&gt;The __2014â15 UEFA Champions League__ will be the 60th season of Europe's premier club [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) tournament organised by [UEFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA), and the 23rd season since it was renamed from the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the [UEFA Champions League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League).

&gt;The [2015 UEFA Champions League Final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_UEFA_Champions_League_Final) will be played at the [Olympiastadion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Stadium_(Berlin\)) in [Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin), Germany. 

&gt;This will be the first season where clubs must comply with [UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Financial_Fair_Play_Regulations) in order to participate.  Moreover, this season will also be the first where a club from [Gibraltar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibraltar) will compete in the tournament, after the [Gibraltar Football Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibraltar_Football_Association) was accepted as the 54th UEFA member at the UEFA Congress in May 2013.  They were granted one spot in the Champions League,  which will be taken by [Lincoln Red Imps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Red_Imps_FC), the champions of the [2013â14 Gibraltar Premier Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013%E2%80%9314_Gibraltar_Premier_Division).

&gt;where Liverpool fans can't even comprehend that fans of other clubs also have pride in their own teams and are fans in the same right

I can understand why United fans have pride in their team- great history, strong tradition of exciting football that captures the imagination. Same with City- personal feelings about Sheikh Mansour aside I have a lot of respect for the club and their fans, and I think them being held up by AMF people as a boogeyman is unfair. I also completely understand why Arsenal fans love their club, both before Wenger and after.

I can even see why a small portion of people love Chelsea. I dated a girl once who was at Wembley with her dad for [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_FA_Cup_Final). When she talked about her club there was a slight quiver in her voice because she loved Chelsea so much it *hurt.* I don't doubt that there are people who truly, completely love their club.

Was that wise?

I can't help you with trendy and fashionable, but I am rather excitable. So perhaps pints on Thursday if some others can be roped in? I'm looking at you Samson, BOT, Mooney, Nutellla and others I can't think of because it's 6:18 and I haven't had coffee yet.

Grub near where you're staying: Shad Thames. La Pont de la Tour (v expensive, VERY good food), the Chop House (less expensive, a bit old fashioned inside) - both owned by Conran. Blueprint Cafe for wonderful views of Tower Bridge and, in my experience, sometimes hit and miss food, but mainly hit.

Tooley Street has some more down to earth restaurants, curry houses etc. 

A bit further up at London Bridge you have Black and Blue if you like trendy (they have cow installations). I've only eaten a steak and chips there so I can't give an opinion other than 'fine' on the food - they also do good cocktails. Roast at London bridge if you want proper meat and veg on a big plate type meal that's GORGEOUS, and not as pricey as the two Conrans. Personally, I'd head for Roast if I wanted some really great grub and La Pont if I was on a date (actually, I was, but it was somewhat sullied by Graham Norton's miserable sulky face when I was there). 

Shad Thames has a lot of restaurants other than the ones I've mentioned, as well as some pubs fronting the Thames. The All Bar One there is decent and has nice views, I had a gorgeous Sunday roast there once; none of your poncey London sized portions, a proper plate that even slightly intimidated me, and I'm no slip of a girl.

Oh - Roast do cocktails to die for (probably with prices to match for you non-London folk). They also have a little stand outside if you want a Roast sandwich. ",0,1399871893,null,0,1399872451,0,chfqm87,t3_25b3kq,t1_chfqm87,t1_chfh11x,null,1433757814,4,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,4

- There no compulsory coursework for the final exams. I did as much as possible, which was a good choice because it gets to be pretty heavy going if you're doing that many!
- 1st year doesn't count; 2nd year exams are 40% of the BA; 3rd year exams are 60% of the BA; 4th year exams are the MA (the 4th year is optional)
- I'm not sure what my MAT was, there is a rumour that I got around 80%, but you don't get told by default.
- The personal statement is not important at all. As long as it demonstrates that you are capable of fluent communication in English, don't sweat it. In particular, only write down books you've read if you enjoyed them and they contributed to your decision to read maths. Do put a hobby or two down on there right in the last sentence (I also enjoy x and y in my spare time). Those two things will likely be the things they ask at the beginning of the interview, first to make sure you wrote it, second to break the ice. Honestly that's all they care about.
- I got a job a couple of months ago as a software developer at a security company.

Just one extra thing to say; if you're interested in pure maths, and have ever been curious about philosophy, I can't recommend highly enough the Maths and Philosophy course. I have a couple of friends who did it and I was extremely jealous.

The duke of westminster just sold off practically his entire [London property portfolio](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/superprime-property-selloff-by-grosvenor-9304010.html)

From April 2015, UK properties owned by non-residents are to be subject to greater taxation (this raises costs of market exit and more investment).

House prices in London have soared by almost 50pc since the economic crisis, and are now 20pc above their pre-crisis peak.

The BoE are predicted to make a 1% interest hike next year.

Just last week the gov'ner of the BoE said that the housing market is a flashing red light on the dashboard.

House prices over most the  south have spiraled out of control to salary amounts. To tackle this, instead of letting the market correct, the government put more coals on the fire by offering buyers of new properties up to the value of Â£600k a 20% loan with help to buy.

You then have clueless Chinese going to expos in Bejing and buying property on print in areas they know nothing about. They have been sold the idea that the market will keep going up and up.

When it happens the government will be out of ideas of how to stop it.

There are many more, but i am typing out oine a time here. I will try and edit and add more in later.

Oh, those in the market will say different. They will talk of 9pc rises each year until 2020 or some bollocks, but this is only because they feed from the frenzy of this bull market with a big government steroid injection in its arse.

The real crap thing about this is all those who are panic buying into the market right now and are going to go through the dire situation of negative equity and reposession.

Get yourself a basic English/French phrase book and learn some helpful words and phrases. A lot of these phrase books will have them split by section - healthcare, directions, food, checking into a hotel. If you choose a smaller pocket sized book you can take it with you and if you get really stuck, point at the phrase in the book.

Maps. Do your research. Know the places you will be going. Know where you will be staying, how you will get there, what time the metro shuts down. Having that knowledge is reassuring. You dont want to be that idiot who sticks out like a sore thumb.

Budgets. As a solo traveller, regular accomodation/hotels are unfortunately a lot more expensive than you might anticipate as you pay for the room not the occupants in it. Check your hotel for single rooms/rates. You will save a lot more money on food as you can eat wherever you want, when you like. Plan your stay, work out how much you will need for the days, and add a little extra in there. 

Paris is beautiful, and is good for a long weekend. Lots to things to do and places to visit. Its easily accessible from London (Eurostar or airports), most larger UK airports should service Paris too. That could be an easier starting point for you.

Rodgers needs to be stronger with the star players especially Suarez. I don't care how good he is Luis can't play in every game. The reason he's been poor the last few games is he's knackered and should have been rested more.

This is one reason I'm apprehensive about Britain leaving the EU.  Yes, the EU is bureaucratic and does a lot of daft things.  It has its problems like any political body.  But I also think many of the EU's laws have protected civil rights.  I've yet to see the Tories or UKIP outline what they would do to replace the *good* laws that the EU has made.

&gt;

&gt;__Rannoch railway station__, on the [West Highland Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Highland_Line), serves the area of [Rannoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rannoch) in [Perth and Kinross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth_and_Kinross), Scotland. Its remote location on [Rannoch Moor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rannoch_Moor) is picturesque and makes it attractive to walkers. The station boasts a [tea room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_room), [gift shop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_shop) and [visitor centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_centre).

&gt;Although the railway links the station with [Glasgow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Queen_Street_railway_station) and [Fort William](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_William,_Scotland) on the [West Highland Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Highland_Line), the station area is otherwise more closely linked, by road, with [central Highland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Highlands) towns and villages on or near the [A9 road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A9_road_(Great_Britain\)). The B846 road meets the A9 between [Pitlochry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitlochry) and [Blair Atholl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blair_Atholl), about 34 miles (55Â km) east of the station.

If you truly don't care about levels of inequality, either you're a very unusual human being or you're into self-deception.  Although, as it often works at a subconscious level there's actually not much need for self-deception.

Anyway, almost all the markers of social malaise manifest more frequently and more seriously, all other things being equal, as inequality increases.  And it's not hard to understand why - a person surrounded by others on equally stupidly small amounts of money doesn't feel particularly poor (and yes, this is assuming they have access to the basics, there's such a thing as absolute poverty too), likewise, if everyone suddenly had a million bajillion quid, ultimately no one would feel particularly well off and many/most prices would rise to reflect the real scarcity of goods and services fairly quickly.  Rich people surrounded by people richer then themselves start to experience jealousy about who has the biggest bestest jet or diamond and will often carry on obsessing about ramping up their wealth long after any conceivable needs they have are met. 

What allows one human being to exploit or abuse another are concentrations and disparities of wealth, whether that be between individuals within a society or between societies.  Unless you have ""fuck-off"" money, you're forced to take a shitty job from the person with capital to keep a roof over your head and food on your plate, likewise working people from the developed world can take a long haul holiday to some developing world economic backwater and play the rich Westerner, having the ordinary souls there dance for them in more or less abusive ways.",0,1399888925,null,0,false,0,chfu58x,t3_259mdb,t1_chfu58x,t1_chftskq,null,1433759476,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"&gt;Was Dawson up to scratch this season? Where his performances of the required calibur (""top 4"")?

The season is probably best viewed in two parts, under AVB and under Sherwood. Under AVB he played every minute in the opening 10 games which saw Spurs claim the best defensive record at the time, showing that he certainly has the ability to compete at the required level. Under AVB only a single goal was conceded in Europe, Dawson was on the bench this game (no goals conceded when he played in Europe under AVB, 5/5 clean sheets).

Under Sherwood he was dropped for 6 games, there was only one clean sheet in these games. As I mentioned in the OP, I don't believe the tactics of either manager suited him and with Sherwood opting for two up front and no defensively minded midfielder I think life couldn't have been much tougher for Dawson. This season he showed himself to be a solid option and granted he was part of a brilliant defensive core at the start of the season I would say he definitely has what it takes.

&gt;How do you rank him in comparison to our other CB options both currently and going forward? Does this change if we drop the high line?

There isn't much doubt that on raw talent alone Vertonghen is our best CB. However, Vertonghen had a very poor season by his previously set standards. Based on this season I would say Chiriches &gt; Vertonghen = Dawson &gt; Kaboul &gt; Capoue. Granted Chiriches/Vertonghen are much younger I can see them pushing on for the starting CB spots in seasons to come.

&gt;Would you like to see Dawson retained this window? Why or why not?

Yes. With Capoue being unsettled and Kaboul being an injury wreck I think we would be silly to throw away CB depth. ",0,1399891293,null,0,false,0,chfuiwy,t3_25ckaz,t1_chfuiwy,t3_25ckaz,null,1433759654,8,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,8

true,cathartis,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,"&gt; If I have Â£1 billion but I never spend on ""power"" then I am no more or less powerful than any average man on the street. 

No, you'd still be powerful. You'd simply be choosing not to use that power. However if you actually spend or invest your money then you would indirectly be exerting power over huge numbers of other people. Businesses would thrive or go bankrupt according to your decisions. This would have very real effects. People would lose jobs, whilst others would gain them. How could you claim, for example, that a decision to move a factory from Wolverhampton to Xiamen was anything other than an exercise of power?

&gt;  If I'm loaded and you aren't, I don't see how that's harming your freedom.

There are many ways you could hurt other people's freedom. A simple example would be for you to use your money to lobby for laws that restricts peoples write to protest. You could buy large amounts of land, and restrict other people's ability to walk over it. You could use your money to provoke wars in far away places, and then use the newspapers you've brought to explain how these wars are all fought in the name of ""freedom"" and that you're killing tens of thousands for their own good. 

Another example would be the laws on areas such as Patents and Copyrights. When these were initially introduced they were quite reasonable. However they've since been corrupted by wealthy elites to server their interests at the expense of the freedom of ordinary people. 

What about all the corruption we've seen in our headlines? Do you honestly think this corruption was prompted by poor people? The more inequality we have in our society, the more corruption you should expect to see - since bribes become (relatively) cheaper for the wealthy, whilst their control over the media and the law, the two avenues that ordinary people can turn to to fight back, will tighten. A corrupt society is not free.

However the true effects of wealth inequality are more insidious. I'd really recommend that you read the book ""The Spirit Level"" for a more thorough investigation, which is backed up by a wealth of statistics. It explains that countries with high levels of inequality statistically fare far worse in areas such as health and education. David Cameron even used to recommend the book back in the days when he was more intellectually honest (i.e. before he became Prime Minister).",0,1399891335,null,0,1399893196,0,chfuj71,t3_259mdb,t1_chfuj71,t1_chfj9ch,null,1433759658,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

It just seems like he's totally forgotten how to play, he takes **far** too long on the ball, to the extent where he can be in absolutely acres of space but by the time he has decided that he does in fact need to to something with the ball other than standing there like a fucking lemon the opposition defender is on his toes and he tries to bundle his way past the player. Every-time we are on a counter attack and the ball finds its way to Johnson he will completely and utterly destroy any sort of momentum by using this strange lemon tactic of his and then deciding to pass the ball backwards, thus giving the other team a chance to re-group and get behind the ball.

Then there is his defending. He has no positional sense whatsoever, but now he's lost a yard of pace which he used use to hide the fact that he was pretty much never in the correct position. I actually blame Johnson for some of our issues at CB this season, with the right sided centre back usually getting dragged out of position because he his covering for Johnson's glaring errors. His tackling is okay at best.

Maybe.  Enough of the underlying detail of the scheme hasn't been released for me to argue conclusively that it's not.  

Taking remuneration through a service company, rather than as pay is legal.  Taking money from that company as a loan, rather than as dividends or pay is legal.

That said even if all the individual steps are legal there's a principle *(Ramsay)* which allows for the whole of the steps to be looked at in terms of whether each of the steps is part of a single scheme whose purpose is the avoidance of tax.  It'd probably be hard to get off the hook for that one.

So the K2 scheme Carr used is more in the grey area where whether it's just inside or outisde the line won't be crystallised until it goes through the courts.  

&gt;That he thought this while himself operating a scheme that paid as little as he could possibly get away with makes him a hypocrite.

Subject to further appeals what they did **isn't** legal, perfectly or otherwise.  The scheme was found not to work.  They therefore self-assessed for tax at an inadequate level.  Doing so isn't legal.

The tax is therefore due and payable *(as I say subject to further appeals)* usually thirty days after the decision to dismiss the appeals is given.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; Yes you can cherry pick but your figures don't actually help your argument but support the point that its not actually stable enough to be used as a valid currency.

Again: I said it's not ready for prime time, yet.  That it isn't stable now is not the same as saying it will never be stable, nor that it is incapable of becoming stable.

&gt; Increasing usage doesn't guarantee a lack of volatility. There's a lot of things that happen with currencies which involve actions of the central bank of the currency, the actions of the governments and the country's economies.

Since bitcoin has no central bank, or government, then usage is all that's left.  And, all other things being equal, it absolutely is the case that the vast majority of stability is conferred by volume of trade.  When bitcoin is traded backward and forward at the same sorts of volumes as currencies on FOREX are traded, then it will be as stable.

It logically has to be the case, as the higher the price, the more of the exchanged currency (say dollars) it takes to move it.  When the total market cap of bitcoin was a million dollars, then any random millionaire could move the whole market.  Now it's market cap is in billions, and the millionaires would struggle to move it.  If it's market cap where in the trillions, the billionaires wouldn't be able to move it.  That's all pretty obvious isn't it?

&gt; Bitcoin is in no way, shape or form a contender due to its massive volatility and the fact that in this country its outside of the remit of the FSA compensation scheme.

FSA is irrelevant -- bitcoin is the equivalent of cash; you hold it yourself.  A stack of Â£50 notes you hold in your pocket is not FSA protected if you get it stolen from you -- just like bitcoin.  If you want an insured account, again the FSA is irrelevant, the private sector will offer that as [a service](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-25680016) -- at your option.

And again: I said it's not ready for prime time.  The only way it gets to prime time though is by increased usage.   People seem to think that ""not ready now"" is the same as ""could never be ready"".  Bitcoin has come from nowhere, and to get from ""nowhere"" to ""stable"" it has to pass through ""volatility"".

To me, this attitude is an abnegation of your democratic rights. You're no longer voicing your own political opinion but expressing the opinion of other people instead, voting for the candidate other people want.

Thinking this way is not democracy, it's puppetry. It's letting other people pull your strings and make you dance the way they want. It's being reduced to the role of a ventriloquist's dummy: you're making all the movements, but it's someone else's voice being heard and not your own.

If your preferred candidate won't win, you should vote for them anyway; because that reduces the winner's majority and lets the winner know that some of you chose someone else.

Thoroughly.  Not one car was bought.  Not one car was sold.

The loses arose from entering into financial contracts which he admitted were set out specifically and only to generate the level of losses he desired.

It was suprising they took it to the Tax Tribunal *(Moyles et al, not HMRC)* because the decision is public and when you look at the mechanics of the scheme it doesn't look like it had a snowflake's chance in Hell.

But regardless of the dodginess of a scheme as long as you can argue that you took specialist advice and you thought it was all hunky dory, you can avoid penalties.  If you admitted you knew you'd get a minimum 35% penalty.  *(Deliberate - Not concealed.)*  

Moyles had losses of about Â£1m.  In extremely rough terms that gives about a quarter of a million quid of tax for each of the two years the scheme was used.

* Bournemouth - Good atmosphere, beautiful surroundings ([new forest](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Beaulieu_river_at_longwater_lawn.jpg/800px-Beaulieu_river_at_longwater_lawn.jpg) and [purbecks](http://www.stevecoombes.f2s.com/images/purbecks%20group%20back%202.JPG) nearby), decent people.

Both have good nightlives and decent work prospects. Cambridge probably edges it but it is a bit flat so Bournemoth is better if you're outdoorsy because its an absolutely smashingly beautiful piece of the country.   
Both cities have the benefit that ""chavs"" are in the minority so don't swag around like they own the place (""standard"" student types occupy the ""majority"" space).

I also hear lots of good things about [Bristol](http://www.bestwestern.co.uk/images/destinations/city/bristol/overview/bristol-city-centre-avon.jpg) and/or [Bath](http://www.timetowander.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Bath.jpg) (more sleepy).  
Brighton isn't bad but I wouldn't put it in my list personally. It has a good atmosphere and some good people but IIRC its always had a bit of a skag problem and its somewhat chavvy..... although I once won a competition there and the cheque bounced... so maybe I'm just biased. :D.  
However its recommended if you want a [creepy super villian looking hideout on your horizon](http://www.folkesphotography.co.uk/photos/brighton_tBVmlRH.jpg) or a poor man's [Taj](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Brighton_Royal_Pavilion.jpg).",0,1399898375,null,0,1399899224,0,chfw0go,t3_25cqdr,t1_chfw0go,t3_25cqdr,null,1433760422,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

DO NOT have it tailored by Magnoli (sadly this advice is too late for OP), Tennant's suit is VERY slim fit, practically skin tight (when I had mine tailored I actually took a few inches off my measurements, one because I was loosing weight and two because I wanted that look). Magnoli is a tool, he outsources all of his tailoring to Thailand to get it cheap and well, you pay through the roof for a cheap job. He pretty much uses a standard 'slim fit' template which as you can see doesn't work for the look. 

I think it's also cheaper, although when Magnoli learned that people were just buying the fabric and tailoring it elsewhere he doubled the price so I'm not sure any more.

Clegg threw himself enthusiastically into his role as Deputy Prime Minister. He has successfully carried out the role of acting in the interests of the Government, but this has been to the detriment of his party.

It would have been in the interests of the party for Nick to explain what the Lib Dems wanted, and why they didn't get it.

Of course, I don't think it was possible for Nick to get this *right*. It would have been impossible for him to please everyone.

selfish - adjective - (of a person, action, or motive) lacking consideration for other people; concerned chiefly with one's own personal profit or pleasure.

Now, if I go out and donate what spare cash i have to the homeless but need to keep the rest so that I am sustainable, does that make me selfish? No, it doesn't. 

If I can't keep myself clothed and housed, I can no longer attend work and consequently can't generate an income which can be used to support others.

&gt;I understand that Britain First may well be far-right lunatics but that doesn't mean *everything* they do is illegal or immoral.

&gt;If we're going to post articles and take the moral high ground, then we should at least be impartial and look at the evidence of what actually happened.

You're being so oblivious to the context here that I'm at a loss for words. 

Something doesn't have to be illegal to be unacceptable. 

The reason Britain First were handing out these bibles, and describing their actions with the language they did, was to incite a reaction. It's passive aggressive in the extreme- the message is, essentially, ""Your kind and creed aren't welcome here.""  

You're trying to analyse a human issue from an abstract position, and *completely* missing the point.

And I think that is going to be bad for Britain. Who is now right? In any case, it's always better to be in what kind of swamp you are in, even if it's smelly and not really nice, rather than jump into the unknown as that is exactly what is going on with Brexit.

&gt;You're stereotyping all anti-eu people, and shutting down the argument by focusing on the ukip-types (the minority) 

Wait, what? I am in the knowledge that UKIP-ers are UKIP-ers and I sincerely doubt majority of them have different approach then the one which the party suggests.

&gt;You seem to be prejudice against any talk of brexit because you benefit from the free movement part of the eu.

To be frank with you I won't be affected personally. I'm going to get a British citizenship this year and I will be both British and EU citizen, so any changes won't affect me much.

&gt;Well my parents were immigrants before the eu existed, it doesn't stop people making a better life for themselves if we left the eu.

Oh yeah, I've heard that argument before. And to make the case more serious I came here on a visa as well (before the EU) so yeah, it can be done....... but, is this the solution we are looking for? Isn't it the whole point to make things better and easier for us - humans? You know, my grandma had to eat soups with grass, does it mean I need to repeat it as she still managed her life?

It's the whole beauty of the EU. Less divisions, less borders, less bureaucracy and plenty of other things which help us, average citizens.

In your case, with only one year's loan, you can expect to pay it off in full and you can consider paying off early to reduce the interest. It's no longer the case that you'd make a profit by putting money in a savings account rather than repaying the loan. However, I'd still probably make it the last thing to do with any spare money when you're sure that you couldn't do anything more useful than repay the loan.

As for UKIP - I doubt when their manifesto is published that it'll be anything like as bad as people are expecting. They know what their image is, they know people will jump on any opportunity to prove that they're racists, so I reckon they'll be very careful about what they write down.


I wouldn't call them all racists, but I think they're close-minded and attract the sort of people who are thinking about their own personal wants on a short term basis, rather than what might be good for the country in the future.

I think everyone is just sort of losing perspective on Sherwood, like he's this idiot terror on the team. It seems to me like he wasn't the right person to take over a struggling team at the midway point of a season--you need a little more clout to impose yourself on the players for that. But that doesn't mean Sherwood is a bad manager; it just means it wasn't the right situation.

In addition, when you know you're going to be losing your job, it only gets worse. Players won't listen because they have longer contracts than you, which makes it hard to build a team identity. If Levy had backed Sherwood more publicly and to the team, maybe Sherwood would have worked out and his lack of clout could have been overcome.

In the end, it didn't really work, so it seems like something needs to change to the benefit of both parties.

Generally speaking however, no.

Your *school* is telling girls that post revealing profile pictures on social media sites that they are ""asking for it""?

I'm guessing it's because you have no idea what you're talking about?

Commercial aircraft already have transponder systems that send their location to ground control. These are in no way secure and rely on the aircraft to ""tell the truth"" about it's current location.

If someone ""owned"" an aircraft, it would not be difficult at all for a somewhat skilled person to re-wire the circuit from the GPS unit to the transponder. Yes, it would require some knowledge of avionics, but not a great deal. 

Certainly you *could not* rely on a such a trust based system for defence purposes.

I just hope this doesn't leave is in limbo for a long time. If we don't strengthen the sqaud we're going to struggle again next season and I don't know how many more seasons we can scrape by avoiding relegation.

On the bright side it seems Lerner has the best interests of the club in mind when it comes to prospective buyers. I just hope it's a quick process.

Edit: On second thoughts maybe I was being too negative earlier. I do trust Randy to look out for the club and overall I think he's been a good chairman.

I read this on Forbes:

""Over the past five seasons, only five English soccer teamsâManchester City, Chelsea, Manchester United, Stoke City and Liverpoolâhave spent more, net, onÂ player transfers, than Aston Villa.""

It really put into perspective that Lerner's heart has always been in the right place, even if some of his choices haven't always been the best, good, or sometimes even understandable (Houllier&gt;McLeish).

We should be a big draw. Large suburban area underrepresented in football, grand history, top facilities, (somewhat) large fan base. We're prime for some sugardaddy to play his Football Manager fantasies with us. But how many of them are there floating around?

There's loads of other successful agencies too with national and global big brand clients and Manchester is a fairly big financial hub. 

In terms of you wanting a small town, it's actually surrounded by nice small towns/villages which have a 'Cheshire' feel but still aren't a million miles away from anywhere else. For what it costs to live in London, you'd find any number of places in Alderley Edge, Wilmslow etc well in budget. Think Marlow etc but a lot closer! 

We're right next to Derbyshire, Cheshire, Wales and the Lakes which between them are probably the most spectacular of English scenery so only a small drive out at the weekend if you want to see really quaint stuff.

I ended up in a place called Didsbury, right on the outskirts of Manchester which has a nice small town/village feel but is only 30 mins into Manchester on the tram. 

But, as with most people, a job opportunity will dictate where you go.

To decide if an investment is viable, you compare against what you would get if your money sat in your bank account, not against what you would get with some other currency, in some other parallel universe.

If the prevailing inflation/deflation rate is `p`, then provided an investment pays more than `p`, then it's a good investment.

It's the appeal to popularity.

I've actually heard people say that a vote for a candidate who won't win is ""a wasted vote"".  
No. A wasted vote is one for something you don't want. Even a spoiled ballot or abstaining would be more honest and less of a waste.  
It makes me suspect that many people have little idea _who_ to vote for, so they simply like to back the winner. Not just in elections, but in TV phone-ins, Grand Nationals and various other events.

Well, a vote for a *true* no-hoper is somewhat wasted, but equally a vote for a candidate you think will definitely win is 'wasted' to precisely the same extent -  either way you're not affecting the outcome, and your influence is confined to *maybe* being seen as endorsing some policies that the winner might adopt from the loser that you voted for (or not, if you gave the winner a slightly greater mandate)

It's a weakness of the voting system that there are quite so many wasted votes. In the absence of a proportional system to really make them all 'count' the ideal vote is one for a candidate who stands a good but not certain chance of winning, and who you think is better than the other major contenders.

As it stands, for some people reading the poster (a lot actually given how large the SME sector is in terms of employment) that statement is 100% accurate. For some people it might now be, but it actually still has an effect on them. And that's before you even consider the perverse distortions it would place on the market to scrap the entitlement for small companies. 

What counts as a small company? What happens when the company outgrows that? Do they have to introduce holiday entitlement for everyone? Do they have to offer the statutory minimum for any new employees? Would you agree that it would act as a disincentive to growth? Do more work, potentially make less profit. Would you agree that it would make it more difficult for SMEs to hire people unless they were offering the same holiday entitlement anyway? In the long run, it wouldn't be tenable to maintain the preferential treatment of small businesses; if they were in control I'd imagine the direction would be towards scrapping holiday entitlement for everyone as opposed to reintroducing the entitlement for everyone. 

Basically, even taking into account the exact nature of the policy, it's a fucking terrible one. More targeted assistance can be provided that doesn't distort the market and start us on a slippery slope and doesn't come at the expense of those most in need of protection.

I don't think so. Pawn shops and gambling shops thrive when rents are low and people are desperate (by virtue of unemployment/real-terms wage drops). That happens during recessions. If they were being entrenched we wouldn't see them close down as the economy recovers. As we are, and I've seen a lot closing down, I think we can assume that it's not becoming entrenched but abating.

Speeding is a tricky issue. If you made it legal to drive at higher speeds, deaths probably wouldn't come down. They might go up, by a little bit. Say if 5 extra people died a year. You now have to convince those 5 peoples families that your change in the law was a good idea.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Commercial aircraft already have transponder systems that send their location to ground control

and ground control is located in geostationary orbit? not very relevant otherwise, considering this is an article about satellites 

GPS doesn't need to rely on anything telling you where it is, it can rely on satellites picking up a a transmitted signal, then triangulating where the source of that signal is. There are ways of using GPS satellites that go beyond what a Â£59 halfords brand sat nav can do. It's also exactly how the system inmarsat already use works currently. 

&gt;if someone ""owned"" an aircraft, it would not be difficult at all for a somewhat skilled person to re-wire the circuit from the GPS unit to the transponder

after they'd landed the plane and managed to break into the unit with tools they couldn't get through security, sure- but they can't tell the plane to transmit the wrong coordinates, they can only disable the system altogether. To be able to turn the system off, you need to land the plane, and it's tracking you all the while. 

&gt;Yes, it would require some knowledge of avionics, but not a great deal.

Why would avionics come into it?

&gt;Curious, what is it you know (or think you know) that makes you think you'd need to be able to break any encryption to do this?

The system I'm envisioning transmits it's in distress unless it's given the right timestamp by the plane itself, to stop hijackers from spoofing that information the timestamp is encrypted on chip before it's given to the transponder. Unless you've found some way of breaking every encryption method known to man (and if you have GCHQ would love a copy of your resume) it would not be possible for hijackers to spoof the timestamp without at *least* taking the chip on the plane apart 

you can have as many chips as you want all over the plane too- one connected to each wingtip, preventing the removal of the wings without setting the distress beacon off, one connected such that it breaks connection if the cockpit door is opened in flight, etc. They make sure it's not possible to remove the transmitter unit or any part of the plane without triggering a distress call.

You're not bothered about the abuse itself, you don't want to comment on the nature of what was said - what bothers you is that someone found it.  You've managed to remove the victim out of the equation. 

If you want to be consistent  then what you should do is when ever someone highlights any crime or abuse - you should immediately tell them that they're just looking for it. 

Let's walk that logic a bit further. So according to you, a crime report is a person just looking for crime to report and it turns them on. A whistle blower at the NHS is just looking for a negligence claim , becuase that's what they do. 

By removing the victim , you remove the abuse. By removing the abuse you remove the importance and the moral culpability of the abuser. Thus you excuse the abuse. 

In effect you end up saying ""they were asking for it""... ""he was asking for it"" .. or ""she was looking for it""..

true,LordAnubis12,eng-sussex,Brighton,"I've never said that renting is better than buying, but I do think that renting has a social stigma, or at least did when I moved out a few years ago, of this useless, pointless venture that only silly people do. 

My issue is more that renting shouldn't always be talked out of the room and that buying is the only solution (I know you're not saying this either) but that renting for a few years may open up doors and offer flexibility that buying doesn't - but people often seem to ignore this, or at least family/friends seemed to shun renting in the S.E even though that's where the jobs/money is, and overall a better quality of life (for me at least). 

The issue (again, for me) is that there's no way currently I can afford a mortgage. Sure, I'd buy in an instant if I could, but there's no way for me to find a Â£50k deposit - but I can afford to rent and until the point at which I can save a big enough deposit there's potentially a lot of shit that might happen due to poor rental laws because a lot of people (again, not you) just don't have enough protection regarding rents but the majority of home owners have probably never had any contact with it, and refuse to think it exists because people that rent are just financially frivolous or whatever - or at least this is the stigma I've come up against in the past. I think this is mostly generational - my parents bought a house at 20, as did my older sisters. 


So I do agree with you that society based on property owner ship is an issue, but it's already happening and unless something changes soon, we'll end up in a situation with no new rental controls/laws/whatever, as well as a lot of BTL property owning-people without a sufficient middle ground because there's a lack of talk about the fact people now **have** to rent.

I agree that some regulation is better than none - but it's just sticking a plaster on the wound - we need to address the disease not the symptoms or our society really will regress a hundred years back to an entrenched class system.

I think there is another issue as well that the modern labour market is a lot more transient than the past so you move from job to job and city to city a lot more. So perhaps home ownership isn't ideal? But something has to be done to prevent what is basically massive exploitation at the moment.

I accept that Levy has done some great off the field work in harnessing the club's potential income but I don't consider him the big success that others on here seem to think.

As for the chart, one of the reasons Spurs tend to finish near the top is because the gap between rich and poor has grown. Spurs as a major London club can generate enormous amounts from ticket sales, merchandise and sponsorship. Most big clubs now take advantage of this.

So perhaps home ownership isn't ideal? But something has to be done to prevent what is basically massive exploitation at the moment.

I think this is the issue, and there's no real modern housing solution that deals with it. Maybe council run rental parks or something where it's fairly low rents but people can move in and out of easily? I dunno, as you say regulation itself isn't going to help, we need more housing - but the issues are where to build it and what kind to build - i.e low cost? Higher end? Council/Social Housing?

THough I guess at this point it's more of a 'just build *something*' problem.

Well, retiring and renting is fine if the pension is enough to cover the rent ;) Which it probably won't be. I guess if you save enough to pay for it you'll be okay, but is in rare situations (there's a video somewhere about renting vs buying and how it's cheaper to rent and save in certain situations). 


Yeah I love renting right now but mostly because I'm young, have no other choice, and have a seemingly nice/understanding landlord and live in a lucky/nice part of town.

Personally, I think that no religions should get charitable status, but I think it's also difficult to have any independent or governmental body decide whether a think-tank is making false claims or not in its literature.  What if it were decided that a left-wing think tank was misrepresenting economics for criticizing capitalism?  

Edit: BTW, the scientific community has a system for working through these problems.  The way they do it is that anyone can say anything they like and anyone can criticize any dogma, no matter how entrenched.  However, that doesn't mean that anyone will respect your ideas.  The reason there's a scientific consensus on GW is not because dissenting opinions have been shut down or punished, but because the community has for the most part found the arguments for GW to be more compelling than those against.

Edit II:  Also, according to the article it seems that this think-tank was trying to put pressure on the LSE for employing someone who had questioned their charitable status.  I find that unacceptable behavior.

From the moment he was appointed, everyone knew it was highly unlikely that heâd last beyond the end of the season, which made it very hard for him to impose his will on the players.

If a short-term coach tells you something you donât like, you make a fuss about it in the press, knowing heâll be sacked at the end of the season. Heâs obviously someone who likes things to be done his way, and found it almost impossible to get players to toe the line when they knew heâd be out soon. 

I disagree about him not progressing the team. Iâd say Kane, Eriksen and Bentaleb are far better players since heâs been in charge, and I am much, much happier seeing Spurs play his brand of attacking football than AVBâs death-through-sterile-possession football.

Did I say it was easy? It wasn't easy, hence the whole change for the current way which is way easier and simpler than what it used to be before the EU's free movement. The argument ""If people really want they can still get it... somehow"" is just idiotic in this context.

I have a few reservations about Maths and Philosophy as a degree, I'm not sure if you would know but do you know if the course is equally split math/phil or is it more like a maths major and a philosophy minor (like at American universities). I would probably only apply if it was at most 20% philosophy because I am very much more interested in maths.

However, personally I'd take the full loan as long as I could trust myself not to spend the money if I don't need it. If it turns out that you didn't need the loan after all and the money sits in an ISA until you graduate then that's a much better situation than if you don't need it but throw it all away on shiny gadgets or beer just because the money is there.

I think that in the cases where you're better off with the loan, you'd really regret not having it. In the cases where with hindsight you'd have been better without the loan, it won't be a great hardship. Taking the money gives you more options, and in my opinion the possible negative effects are outweighed by the possible benefits.

If you walk straight out of university into a well-paid career, then you'll pay the loan off in full and if you never really needed the money then you've paid interest on it for no reason. However, in that case you could pay off the loan early to limit the interest you pay, and you're unlikely to lose sleep over it. Depending on where mortgage rates are then, you could still be better off putting the money towards a house deposit to get a better mortgage deal rather than repaying the student loan.

Yes there is.  You can criticize them.  You can expose their untruths.  You can provide better arguments.

The cynical POV is that the public are gullible and will believe any hogwash that's given them.  But, I don't think that's true.

As long as everyone has the chance to have their say and everyone is allowed to criticize any argument then reason will ultimately win.

However, all the Villa fans that are saying that Lerner needs to sack Lambert before he sells up need a reality check. He might be a rubbish manager but over the summer, any manager is better than no manager. It's not like he can get us relegated again during the Summer. Hold tight and hope a take over happens within the next few months! Cannot see any signings or a new manager over the summer though. Paper work for buying a house takes 3-4 months, a football club worth hundreds of millions will take a little bit longer I suspect. In my opinion I think Lambert will still be there at the start of the season and if he has a few rubbish games he will get the sack. Although a new owner could potentially mean more investment, especially as Lerner is not willing to put any more money in the club, he has been a very very good owner and not interfered with much at all. He gave O'neil millions to splash out and wanted nothing in return. Now take a look at Cardiff. Look at what their owner has done over there. The last thing we want is to have our claret and blue taken away from us and change Villa Park to Nike Arena. I think I speak for all Villa fans when I say we'd rather take our chances with no money than to sell out our rich history.

true,ColdFusion87,null,null,"Cash ISAs are pretty rubbish at the moment because the Bank of England interest rate is so low. However the intestest is free money, so if you've got spare cash to put in, then go for it.

As Leandover said, stocks and shares ISAs aren't fixed interest, so you do need be a little careful. With stocks and shares, you have to remember that while on average values will go up, there is the possibility for things to go down. If you might need your money sooner rather than later (e.g. for a deposit) then a cash ISA may be more suitable. If you are planning on saving long-term then stocks and shares could give you a better return.

Pensions are very useful as your employer should also contribute. With a pension, your money is locked up until you retire, which AFAIK is 55 and over only. So again, if you need to save for a deposit, then bunging cash into a pension may not be an immediate priority. Saying that though, the sooner you start paying into a pension, the bigger then returns will be. [It makes a huge difference just starting a pension  now rather than in 10 years time](http://www.standardlife.co.uk/1/site/uk/financial-education/retirement-planning/start-pension).

Salvaging our season to a 6th place finish was not ideal by any means but after seeing the free-fall we were in under AVB, I would say that Tim did a decent job in taking the helm and providing some damage control.

Let's be honest, the plethora of managers we've had in the past 10 years is staggering and you can't have that kind of instability at a club if you are trying to be a top 4 team, it simply makes us look bad. We like to label Sherwood as an idiot who is tactically inept but it's not like we hired some guy off the streets. I get annoyed sometimes when redditors spew a bunch of garbage like they could do a better job, but this is a public forum where the expression of opinions and ideas make it great so I understand where people are coming from. I would let Sherwood see out the remainder of his contract to see what he could do with a pre-season and a few key additions. Let's not forget what he's been able to get out of players like Adebayor and up-and-comers like Bentaleb, Velkovic and Fryers.

But I am not the chairman and I cannot make those decisions, I can only get behind whatever decisions the club ends up making and hope for the best.

A device that tells you where you are - like your phone, for example, when you use Google Maps - is called a ""GPS *receiver*"", and it doesn't transmit anything.

The orbits of the GPS satellites are fixed and predictable, so your phone knows what those orbits are - the GPS satellites just transmit their ID and the time (to a very precise accuracy), and they broadcast it constantly, like radio 4 transmits the same thing to all listeners.  

The GPS in your phone knows how far it is from each of the satellites by calculating the difference in milliseconds of the timestamps. This allows calculation of how long the signal has taken to travel from the satellite, and thus how far away from the satellite it is; it knows its location by triangulating the distance from multiple satellites.

I don't know anything about the airplane location systems in use, but it wouldn't surprise me if it was indeed unencrypted and ""laughably easy"" to fake - that's certainly the case for boats. Someone just halfway smart with only days preparation could board a ferry or a cruise-liner and tell it a supertanker was on a collision course - hopefully the ferry will have radar and visibility and not act on a ""ghost"" AIS signal, but they'd probably be freaking out at first. I'm sure you could cause a collision or run a boat aground if you picked the right place.

If you look at the season as a whole then it's just nuts to suggest our offense should have done more to make sure we win the league.  We were absolutely incredible going forward scoring 101 goals (1 fewer than City) in 38 matches.  Just as a cheeky point of comparison we've currently scored 2 more league goals than Barcelona has this season and if they score less than 2 against Atletico this weekend we'll end up having only been outscored in repective league play by Manchester City and Real Madrid across the top 5 leagues in Europe.  Conversely, defensively we conceded 50 goals (13 more than City/23 more than Chelsea/7more than Arsenal, 27 more than PSG/20 more than Monaco, 27 more than Juve/26 more than Roma, 27 more than Bayern/12 more than Dortmund).

true,Mr_Jpg,flair5,,"&gt;  Was Dawson up to scratch this season? Where his performances of the required calibur (""top 4"")?

 He did what he could in a system he doesn't suit. Dawson is fairly slow, and prefers to sit back and let the forward run at him and make sure they can't do anything. He played in a system where he was required to be constantly running at the attack and stop it early.

&gt; How do you rank him in comparison to our other CB options both currently and going forward? Does this change if we drop the high line?

If we continue with the high-line then Kaboul/Chiriches are our best bet. They're great attacking, and if anyone plays the ball over then they can get back and defend without Lloris requiring some heroics.

If we come across a team when we're going to be playing more defensively, then Dawson is perfect. He can sit back without being required to run around, and just make sure the attack can't get a shot in.

&gt; Would you like to see Dawson retained this window? Why or why not?

I'd prefer to see him stay. He's loyal, he always gives his best, and he commands the back-line better than anyone else.

Remember the massive contrast in investment, and remember who will end the season with a trophy. Remember who has failed, and remember who has succeeded. We were even only 3 points behind you with our 3 best offensive players injured for 3 months. Laughable, what has happened to Chelsea? 

To go two years without success at clubs with the amount of investment at Chelsea/Real Madrid takes a special one. A specialist in failure.

Wenger will always be superior, because Wenger actually has the ability to achieve in management without huge, huge investment. He also has the knowledge on how to play offensive football, which Mourinho either doesn't possess or doesn't have the guts to. Wenger has never gone a season without failing, because when Arsenal built a new stadium their expectations weren't of a big club because of the financial constraint. We essentially went from Liverpool finances to Everton's, but I'm sure you do not understand this. Now things are different and Wenger is still achieving. One year of investment and he wins a trophy, Mourinho spends 30m on his Willian's and gives Eto'o 100k a week and doesn't win a thing.

true,LordAnubis12,eng-sussex,Brighton,"I'm probably 'the left' but I have no issue with people making profit on housing, as long as it doesn't get to the point currently where it's a massive social issue and likely to go badly for everyone and is essentially giving a few people all of the property, so it's that there's very few people making profit on it, rather than it being everyday home owners who might have saved up and bought a second home. 

Rent caps are pretty stupid idea as it forces stagnation and it's a temporary solution to only one part of the problem. 

I don't think it's a leftist issue to say that we currently have an unstable and inefficient housing market though.  

One of the other issues that is highlighted is large costs to move house incurred by estate agents for very little work - the issue is not the profit aspect per se but more that it hinders social mobility and means a lot of people can't move to where jobs might be and thus progress their life/career - again not sure this is a leftist issue. 

Again in regards to social housing I'm not sure if that is even a left-y issue. From my point of view the main reason to give homeless houses is so that they can rebuild their lives and get jobs. Without a fixed address they can't apply for anything - benefits/jobs/nectar cards etc. 

I think if you put it into context of having someone living on the street vs having a healthy 'hardworking taxpayer' with job and life prospects as well as being a contributor to society, I'm not sure that's a massively left-stance to take. Of course the issues with homelessness are more complex than this, but you get my point.

I would like to see us make a run for Mattia DeSciglio from Milan or Danilo from Porto. DeSciglio is young and can play on both sides really well. He was great at LB for Milan last year and is naturally a RB. Luckily, we're not looking to buy strikers this year. Everyone and their mother wants a new striker, which will make them more expensive. If we do get an attacking player I would like to see us go for Angel Correa out of Argentina. Everyone says he is the next Aguero and the videos I have seen of him look very promising. If we want to make a big signing I would like to see us go after Reus. 

2. I don't think it will be too much of a problem after seeing how PSG was able to work their sanctions down to a fine. To be honest though, I know next to nothing about FFP, only that UEFA wants to keep clubs with lots of money from spending more than they earn. I think they would be better regulating situations like the small clubs in Spain who go bankrupt and sell all their players or like that one club who couldn't afford to pay their players. 

3. Micah Richards and Lescott are gone. I could see Rodwell and Sinclair being sold. I dont expect Barry to come back. I think we will sell one of our strikers for ~20-25m. I could see it being Dzeko or Negredo. I also wouldn't be surprised to see Giudetti being sold. He is 22 and right now is seems to be no more than a cup player. I know his injury last season probably set him back but I don't know if it is worth hanging on to him.

Shaw has not been as good as Baines or Azpilicueta because he's eighteen! I personally think his ceiling is much higher than llalana and he is 7 years younger.

Then Derry.  Plenty of History about there. 

http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/walledcity/ 

Drive on up the North Coast from there. see route below. Spots on the way include Carrick a Rede Rope bridge, Giants Causeway, Bushmills Distillery, Carrickfergus Castle.

http://www.causewaycoastandglens.com/Causeway-Coastal-Route.T186.aspx

Into Belfast, plenty to see. Take a Guided tour, either hop in a taxi and ask him to take you on a tour, or jump on the city tours. You might be able to blag a cheaper, more personalised run in a taxi, depending on luck, and mood of the driver.

~~Head to Newtownards, climb scrabo tower, http://www.scrabotower.com/ decent views of the city from up there, you'll get a few snaps.~~ edit. See below comment. On scrabo.

Head on along the coast to Strangford, get the ferry across 
http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/strangford-ferry-timetable


from there. Seaforde Butterfly House in Downpatrick would be the next thing to see. Gardens are nice on a decent day, but a bit on the over priced side to see a few butterflies. 

Personal note. If your G/F is petrified of Birds. Don't even think it.

Alternative. St. Patrick Centre: http://www.saintpatrickcentre.com/

Newry &gt; Dundalk &gt; Dublin. Who knows you may have time to see stuff on that part of the journey, but I'm not 100% on what to do down there to recommend anything else.

Oh, I agree there. Shaw has an incredible future ahead of him and, should he continue to develop at this pace, he'll be the world's best LB in a couple of years. I'm just a little underwhelmed at how he competed this season when all you hear within the media is how exceptional he is; he wasn't the star that shone brightest within that Saints squad, and that proves that he needs development -- a player that needs development, that needs cultivation, should not be priced at anywhere near Â£27m in my opinion. 

Lallana, on the other hand, doesn't *need* development and has already proved himself good enough to compete with the big boys of the PL. His ceiling is not as high as that of Shaw, but he does have some incredible talent and could improve us as a team undoubtedly. I know people are fast to point to Carroll and Downing to prove that signings can go wrong, but Rodgers seems to understand the culmination of his efforts -- the style of football he wants to play -- more than Daglish did when he purchased the players that were just getting the most attention.",0,1399924457,null,0,false,0,chg7d0x,t3_25chic,t1_chg7d0x,t1_chg5v5u,null,1433765846,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

* heavy investment (check!)

The assumption is that success follows naturally from the expenditure, I think. And when you think about it, in relative terms... we got that too...

* We went to Wembley again for the first time in a decade. 
* European nights returned to Villa Park. 
* Champions League football very nearly came to Villa Park for the first time. 
* There was even a brief moment where we were considered ""dark horse contenders"" for the league title. 
* Villa rose to become the 20th most valuable club in the world
* Perhaps most importantly, were we not entertained?

I understand this isn't the success you think of when you get a billionaire owner, but I think you'd have to be a bit of a stickler to argue that Lerner's stewardship wasn't successful, personally.

Had Lerner been able to invest to the same level as Sheikh Mansour or Abramovich, maybe we'd have won trophies to go on top of our relative success. He wasn't though, not without plunging us into a dangerous situation where we're saddled with unsustainably high costs (which, as a lover of the club, he couldn't do). He was trying to build a self-sustaining, successful club. And very nearly did it. That's the ultimate goal of any owner, and any fan, surely?
