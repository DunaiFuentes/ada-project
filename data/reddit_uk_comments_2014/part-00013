&gt;What accounts for Norway’s success? First and foremost, the state retains control of all aspects of petroleum activity and sets the rules by which the private oil companies play. In Canada, by contrast, the major oil companies are in the driver’s seat in determining oil policy.

&gt;The Norwegian government levies a 28% ordinary tax rate on oil companies. On top of this, it imposes an additional 50% tax to capture the economic rent, or excess profits, for a combined 78% marginal tax rate. Companies, however, can claim reimbursement of the tax value of exploration costs and other development costs. 

&gt;Companies also pay environmental taxes and various fees. But there is no royalty regime.

&gt;Finally, the government owns two-thirds of Statoil, the Norwegian oil giant, from which it collects  a  huge  cash dividend. 

&gt;Petroleum has been integrated with the rest of the economy through active industrial policies that create forward and backward linkages to the capital equipment, oil-rig construction, petrochemicals, and other sectors. 

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19871411

&gt;To be fair, the Norwegians had more money to play with. Their oil production is higher and the proceeds are enormous in comparison to the country's population of just five million.

&gt;Could the British have done it? Well, the Shetland Islands did.

&gt;When oil started arriving at Sullom Voe and ships docked nearby, there was a flood of cash.

&gt;The council set up an oil fund that still stands at £185m today, even after upgrading roads, ferry terminals and local swimming pools.

(This article makes the somewhat ironic observation that a similar scheme was conceived in the 1970s but the immediate pressing concerns of the 70's economic crises meant that money was pissed on that fire instead of being saved into a scheme like Norway's.

Now for comparison here is the government figures on revenue from oil and gas for however many years it is which seems to support his figures, though note that these figures for 2012-2013 only encompass up until April 2013 (tax year based):

&gt;Marginal tax rate
The marginal tax rate is 81% on income from fields paying PRT, 30% on production income from qualifying new fields if that income is wholly covered by field allowance and 62% otherwise.

But there are effects that reduce the income (detailed on that page) like exemptions for newly developed fields, delaying taxable revenue from new fields to later financial years and other things.

On the face of it, his premise is optimistic and as a result of not actually owning the oil companies (or having a majority share) the revenues to the government would be a lot lower; but implementing a similar tax regime would boost revenues a few billion.",0,1389701586,null,0,false,0,cep7yun,t3_1v6jou,t1_cep7yun,t1_cep7sow,null,1431936383,23,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,23

*Police have to act with only a split second to decide sometimes. They're acting for the defence of the public, and in self-defence. When do you draw the line as to confirming whether or not to take the shot? Given that guns can be concealed within bags (or socks) whilst still remaining lethal, how much of a risk should the officer take? Is that object in his hand a gun or something else? Ok, it's shaped like a pistol but is it a real one or a replica? Ok, I think it's a real one, but is it loaded or empty? Ok, it's firing, but are those real rounds or blanks? Ok, my colleague just fell, but was he hit by a bullet from the suspect's gun or did he fall for any other reason?*

It's why the justification works on reasonable belief at the time, and not facts established minutes, hours or years after the event. It's not whether their belief was right or wrong, but whether it was reasonable. The officers have the right to self-defence, including pre-emptive self-defence, just like everyone else in the country, and if they believe lethal force is about to be used against them or someone else, then they can act.

Europa League and goal difference.

Liverpool and Everton aren't distracted by Europe; we almost always drop points after Thursday night games.  We already have a huge injury toll, and more games, on dodgy pitches after long trips, won't help us out there.  Expect to lose more key players before the season is out.

Then there's our goal differential.  It's so bad, there's no way we can make up the difference in less than half a season.  So we can't finish level with anyone else at fourth - it must be outright.

At the moment Liverpool have the best player in the league.  Whatever else their issues, it's way more than we have.  And not only that, they're playing far better than us.  Everton too.  Everton might not keep it up all season, but with our injuries we hardly have a much deeper squad at the moment.  Utd will get RVP back at some point, so I wouldn't even count them out either.  For all their troubles, we all know what Utd look like when they get some momentum going.  They could easily go on a run of 8-10 consecutive wins.

I've given up hope already for this season.  If we make fourth, HUGE bonus.  But fifth or sixth is exactly what I expect.",0,1389702038,null,0,false,0,cep81nd,t3_1v6kss,t1_cep81nd,t3_1v6kss,null,1431936422,6,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,6

""Fibre"" = FTTC = Fibre to the Cabinet. This isn't *true* fibre, but it's the vast majority of UK high-speed services. Your local street cabinet has had a true fibre optic connection (1GB/s or better) run to it. This is then shared between the nearby houses using ordinary copper cable - either BT's way (VDSL) or Virgin's way (coaxial cable). This limits speeds to about 120Mbps at the moment. 

True fibre = FTTP = Fibre to the Premises. The same 1GB/s or better glass cable is run directly into each house, giving another jump in speed. Everyone pretty much agrees this is the future, but hardly anyone's doing it yet because digging up roads and replacing cable to every single house is horrendously expensive. It's madness that this isn't fitted to new building sites as standard - the cable doesn't cost much, it's digging the trench for it that's expensive! 

At the moment unless you're *very* lucky pretty much only businesses can get FTTP. FTTC is sold as 'fibre', although it's not truly all the way to your house.

Johnson is having a bad spell of form, but he should pick up soon, hopefully.

Enrique is back soon.

Skrtel/Sakho/Agger are all great, they just need to be consistent.

Coutinho is a good player, just on bad form. 

Sterling is doing great. Hopefully Ibe can do the same.

Suarez/Sturridge are doing great.

Lucas is upgradeable but he's still doing great, we don't *need* to replace him with another CDM. Same for our CM's also. 

TL;DR: We don't vitally need any new players in the same way Arsenal/United do. If we don't sign anyone then it's no big deal, we've already got a strong starting 11 once everyones back from injury.

We already knew that you could generate a significant amount of energy from renewables. What Germany has done is shown that abandoning nuclear right now is insane. Their brown coal (dirtiest form of coal) usage is up 15%, and they have extremely high energy costs in spite of that.

If you're saying we should be like Germany, do you mean that we should be matching them in increasing our coal usage too?

[BroadbandBuyer have them](http://www.broadbandbuyer.co.uk/Shop/ShopDetail.asp?ProductID=13095) but you can also get them on eBay and Amazon etc.

Unscrew the front part of your master socket, gently pull it forwards. If you have other telephone extensions, there'll be cable running from the front part back into the wall.

That front part comes off to disconnect the extensions and reveal a socket behind it (the ""test socket""). Slide the iPlate in between the front and the back and it'll slot into the test socket. The front plate slots into the iPlate, use the screws that came with the iPlate (they're longer) to screw the whole lot back together. Job done. 

It's worth checking that all the wires look ok and are in firmly when you've got it in bits, but it's probably fine already.

This made me spit out my tea. Have you seen house-prices in London lately? And the reason that the mortgage repayments are low is because interest rates are being kept low to perpetuate high house values.  

Also the source you cite states does indeed list that rent is the only thing higher in London than in Oslo. However, for the poorest people, rent will be as much as 60 or 70% of their income, and going to restaurants will be 0%. Also, because their wages are *so much higher*, it means that the gap between the last pound of their rent, and the final pound of their income is *much larger*, which means that all the other things on that list are comparatively less expensive.

It looks like there were two things specific to shale gas is the 2013 budget. The Shale Gas Field Allowance looks like the same sort of thing as existing allowances for oil and gas fields.

The other thibg was an extension of the Ring Fence Expenditure Supplement from six years to ten. This is a form of enhanced capital allowances that already exists for oil and gas exploration expenditure.

It doesn't really matter if they are new or old forms of renewables, it's 25% in total.

&gt;We already knew that you could generate a significant amount of energy from renewables. What Germany has done is shown that abandoning nuclear right now is insane. Their brown coal (dirtiest form of coal) usage is up 15%, and they have extremely high energy costs in spite of that.

I agree.

&gt;If you're saying we should be like Germany, do you mean that we should be matching them in increasing our coal usage too? Because if you're suggesting instead that we should increase our renewable energy while replacing our coal sources with something cleaner, say, natural gas, then well...that's precisely what the government is aiming to do.

No, I mean what I said. Let me repeat it: We should be looking to match them on renewables and getting most of our other electricity from Nuclear, we shouldn't be aiming to increase the use of any fossil fuels. Germany uses mostly coal as their fossil fuel source for electricity (36%), we use a mix of coal and gas (28% Gas, 39% Coal for a total of 2/3rds of electricity being generated using fossil fuels). We should aim to generate at least half of our electricity using renewables and Nuclear, and reduce our use of fossil fuels. Nothing about this means using more coal, that is a complete straw-man.

true,ninj3,null,null,"Pollution has many components. The biggest one the public worries about these days is CO2, thanks to climate change, but burning fossil fuels produce many other harmful byproducts too. Carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide to name a few. 

These are actually much more harmful than CO2, in terms of climate change and also direct harm to humans. CO is poisonous to animals, as are nitrogen oxides, and sulphur dioxide causes acid rain. CO2 is unavoidable when burning these fuels but the rest are mostly due to incomplete combustion, impurities, and other inefficiencies.

The energy industry has gotten very good at scrubbing these extra harmful products out during the energy production process, so modern plants mostly worry about CO2 more than anything. Gas is also ""purer"" than coal and easier to burn efficiently, so this also helps to reduce the harmful byproducts. 

If we are to go back to old coal fired plants, the pollution would be really terrible. Think of industrial era pollution and the kind of smog that China is dealing with now. But if new plants were made I'm certain that we could make coal power just as ""clean"" as gas. 

Obviously, there's still CO2 to worry about though. And I agree with you that we need to keep pushing hard for renewables and even nuclear (although that's a contentious one) because we need to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels sooner rather than later.

If that company is any good that specification might even be half way reasonable at the time the project kicked off. Then they spend years chasing the specification when both sides know the specification is wrong (either because it was always wrong or because of changing requirements). However the process doesn't allow for changes now. Then at some point somebody calls time on the whole fiasco.

While this is true you won't get cost effective IT from government. Somebody may as well profit from scamming the government while it is mandating that the only system it will work with is a scamming system.

Large departments like the Army, NHS, etc need permanent IT staff with an in sourced, iterative and near focused approach. Delivering only what can be sanely delivered on narrower time scales.

If anything, if America helped fuck up a country in the recent past, then surely it's America's responsibility to do what it can to make the appropriate amends. Not saying they did that, but for an argument against going to war it's a very stupid one.

Yes, you keep saying this, but have no solution to offer. It affects me or you not one iota if the Prince of Wales eats caviar every day, or the Bank of England manager wipes his ass on 50 pound notes. It's downright jealousy, nothing more.

I suggested that even *with* wealth equality it simply wouldn't remain that way for very long. In which case surely we should be focusing on bringing the poorest up to a decent standard of living, instead of playing ""green-eyed monsters"" at those at the very top ?

We *all* want to be rich (or at least not have to worry about the future), I defy anyone to say they don't. If you win the lottery tomorrow, you're not going to donate the lot to the poor, anymore than I am. So why pretend that under similar circumstances to those born with silver spoons in their mouths, you would behave *any* differently?

And really, if we had total equality in all things, then what exactly is there to strive for?

As for restrictions...well, it's a gamble you take. Realistically, it's unlikely that plod are going to bother taking any notice of the 5mph you'll gain on an unrestricted bike. The problem is that if they do, your riding life suddenly becomes a lot more expensive. 

Personally, I'd look for an older bike that's factory output isn't too far above the restricted allowance. A couple of reasons for this: 

1. It's not a stereotypical pedboi bike. A sensible looking older bike is less likely to attract attention than a 4 year old ragged to death Speedfight with race rep decals all over it. 
2. Older bikes have already depreciated. Look after it and you'll get your money back when you come to sell. 
3. There's a chance, albeit not one to rely on, that age will have taken enough toll on the engine to bring the output into compliance even without a restrictor.

If he were born an atheist then he would have not been (as) persecuted, and if he had converted from Judaism to Islam he may have been persecuted for ""abandoning"" his religious beliefs.

It is nothing specifically to do with him being an atheist, more to do with the fact that he is considered a ""traitor"" to the religious group he was born into. Not to say that somebody who converted to Islam probably wouldn't be accepted with open arms in Afghanistan, but technically the specific religious beliefs he now holds are (to my knowledge) not an issue on their own.

true,SecretApe,,"His name is John Carew, he's bigger than the two of you!","I don't know. It's a difficult decision. Red Bull were first linked with a takeover during October/November, now it appears as the rumours are back. 

If Red Bull did buy Aston Villa, we would no longer be known as 'Aston Villa'. Our history, our past would be forgotten by the new generation. Our stadium name would change, our kit colours would change and our badge would be transformed. 

Having said that Red Bull would bring a lot of financial support. Once they join a sport they are in it to win it. They will hire the best staff possible and they will get the best players possible. Aston Villa would be a team fighting for Champions League and Premier League titles. 

I also watch a lot of F1 and Red Bull are devoted to that sport. It brings in a lot of money to the company and a lot of advertisement. They have their own youth development program in F1 and have some of the best engineers out there. Granted many F1 fans aren't happy that a 'Drink Company' have bought their way to success. It would be a similar story with Aston Villa. 

The older fans would certainly be uphappy. However, Red Bull would bring tons of fans into Villa. I'm sure that other fans would also be upset about the take-over.

So it's really down to that. Would you prefer success in the future? Or keep the club heritage and proud history and try to build success through a different method?

Note, Aston Villa have tons of famous fans. The Royal Family have historically been Aston Villa fans due to their unique history. The club has done a lot to English football. 

Many people don't like Lerner and would want him to give Lambert more money. Well, with Red Bull does fans would get their wish. But in a price.

My opinion? I'd be ok with Red Bull buying Aston Villa. I'm not that old and I can't relate to any of proud history, I just wasn't alive to witness it. But, under Red Bull I'd be guaranteed to see some success as an Aston Villa supporter. Maybe Red Bull would keep the name? Red Bull, Aston Villa?

Roads are their for everyone - having a slower vehicle in front is simply tough. That's the joy of sharing a public space. I dare say anyone unable to do that shouldn't get their own way because they have anger issues, they should be removed from the road.

if you don't want cyclists to cycle in the middle of the road, perhaps ask that drivers don't park on the roads, or ask that roads are made wider, or perhaps make sure people understand the concept of sharing, or speed limits are limits not targets....Or not overtake them when you assume its safe todo so.

There is nothing that says there was more than a single instance of overtaking. ""anyone overtaking"" can be any number from 0 to infinity, and is a phrase that can easily be used for hyperbole. Besides, even if there was more than one incident, who's to say that vocal retaliation was unjust?

Anyway, this detracts from my original post which was an attempt to add some insight to the events which led up to the photograph in question.

All I can see from this is a guy on a bike being overtaken in a dangerous manner (seriously, who overtakes when there's an island coming up?), the cyclist expressed his anger at having his well being put in danger and took the middle of the lane to prevent further danger and Clarkson getting up on his high horse because he thought he could make a point out of cyclists' road position.

Effective.

It's just the old ones that are leaking.  (Did you actually read those articles?)

Of course - but when cycling in the gutter you can in many situations be putting your life in danger due to complacency and inconsiderate drivers .

And it only takes one to kill you. Im not sure why I should ask my wife or my child to be considerate when that might put their lives in danger.

You or Clarkson is in no position to say whats ""good reason"" though. The cyclist was not breaking the law, was cycling in a predictable manner, the road is not wide with obstacles on both sides. 

Damned if you do damned if you don't...

&gt;it is perfectly normal to be angry at someone treating the road as their own and showing no consideration.

Be patiant.

The cyclist has no interest in pissing anyone off for the sake of it. Much more likely that he simply didn't want to get doored or run down at a pinch point.

Yes. You say:

&gt;  According to both of those articles, the methane leaks are ... are in any case a temporary release until the well is capped. 

Article says:
&gt; a big part of it is just raw gas that is leaking from the infrastructure.

I.e. The wells were capped ages ago, and have been in production for long enough for sloppy work to start leaking gas. There is also the problem of them leaking after they are out of production, when no-one will be monitoring anymore.

They also have zero information on how the gas migrates from the fracked zone into nearby rock formations and out into the atmosphere over decades. It has simply never been measured as no-one wants to pay for that science to be done.


&gt; [Daily Mail Image]

Thats the test drill site at Balcombe, to verify that enough gas is down there to be worth fracking on a larger scale. Once the tests are done they move to full scale fracking, drilling the fracking wells and fracking a larger area. They then come and sink tap wells into the fracked rock formations and put well heads on them. That would be about 5 well heads per kilometre, plus service roads, over the entire field (I.e. Tens or Hundreds of well heads for the Balcombe area).

I too despair when people label the UKIP or BNP / NF as the only purveyors of racist thought - as long as the older generations support racism then it will remain, i think it is a fact of life that will never go away.

I think a big problem is being set up when discussion of peoples feelings are inhibited or can be shouted down (downvoted here on reddit and other communities), there is certainly a hardcore in here of people who will quickly reply 'i have you tagged as a racist' or 'don't listen to this guy, he posts in /r/niggers', 'don't read this, it is from x'. 

unfortunately the discussion is easily stifled on a smallish sub like r/uk - and of course we see the opposite on /r/worldnews.

The legal status of ganja simply has no relevance to their lives and they grew up under a mindset that demonised it so the issue just stagnates. I have a friend who recently got into it with his parents when they found out he smokes weed. You would not believe the shit-storm his mother kicked up about it. He smokes maybe 2 to 3 times a week, hardly ever drinks, has a job and gets pretty good grades at uni but despite all of this (and all the empirical stuff he showed her) his mother simply could not fathom the notion that his smoking was not having some sort of hellish destructive effect on his life and those around him. Meanwhile his brother is out on the piss every weekend, frequently gets into scraps and has been arrested for drunken disorderly conduct at least twice iirc. His behaviour however she will brush aside with a knowing smile as: ""a young lad enjoying himself, youthful exuberance, a bit of drink never hurt anyone . . .etc"".

true,Pickleburp,null,null,"That's the ""sanitized"" version the LDS church gives. There are court documents from the local legal system in upper state New York where he and his brother were convicted of charging money to find buried treasure using one of the same ""peep stones"" that he later also used to produce the Book of Mormon. They dug in the ground and Smith would claim that the spirits of the Native Americans who put it there were trying to stop them and were moving the treasure around in the ground. He would look through his stone again (very much like a crystal ball use in divination - real crystal balls aren't clear like Hollywood portrays) and tell them where it had moved to, and they would start digging there. This would keep up until people were too exhausted to keep going, at which point he'd announce that it had been moved out of reach for now and they would stop while he pocketed the money.

That was just one story from the court records. There were many other allegations brought up against him. One that sticks out was that Joseph and either Hyrum or Alvin had used blood magic to try and find hidden Native American treasure by sacrificing a stray dog. I don't believe they were actually convicted, but there were multiple witnesses.

On the subject of the ""peep stones,"" JS had several by the time he died, which the LDS church keeps in a lockbox in the granite vault. A lot of Mormons have heard that. He found the first one while digging a well, something that the LDS church also acknowledges. There's a story in LDS lore about a woman named Sally that used a ""green crystal ball"" and ""dark magic"" to try and find the golden plates Smith claimed to have. What they don't tell you is that JS knew Sally and had borrowed this exact same green peep stone to divine the location of one he found and used for ""translating"" the Book of Mormon.

EDIT: If you're curious about my sources, the scanned versions of the court documents can be found online.

There may be something in the county closer to them but I am unaware.  Since the games are all on NBS sports most sports bars should have them available.

Which isn't to say Aspas can't come good. But if we're going to sign someone for depth we've got to believe they can at least come in and regularly put in a shift. Are we there yet? I think its why Rodgers has looked to sign so many players on loan. He knows that in the summer we might be able to attract players who actually improve our first 11 and, in doing so, provide more depth because previous starters move to the bench or rotation. 

At this point in time I think we need depth at DM. Its the one clear depth position. Signing a striker sounds well and good but I'm not sure who we get who can get no minutes and come in at the 78 minute mark and make a difference. Without dropping a lot of cash.

**Davies Rules Out 'Doctor Who' Appearance In 'Torchwood' Bringing the two into the adult universe would be a 'clash of styles'**

by MICHAEL HINMAN, posted Jun-22-2011 Source: NME

Well, it's not like we really expected Russell T. Davies to reverse his long-standing position on this.

**The ""Torchwood"" creator, best known to genre fans for his work in reviving the iconic Doctor Who franchise for BBC, says there's absolutely no chance that you'll see the Tardis pop up in the world of ""Torchwood."" And it has nothing to do with the fact that both shows are now separated by an ocean and Davies is no longer involved with ""Doctor Who.""**

""No, because actually, **The Doctor's never gone into Torchwood,"" Davies told reporters at the American premiere of ""Torchwood: Miracle Day"" on Monday, courtesy of NME. ""It's always been the other way around. Torchwood's gone into 'Doctor Who,' which I think is correct because there's a big child audience for 'Doctor Who,' and I think that would demand if we took The Doctor into Torchwood, it would be a clash of styles.""**

Capt. Jack, the immortal Torchwood leader played by John Barrowman, was actually first introduced in a first season episode of ""Doctor Who"" in 2005 when Christopher Eccleston was playing the title role. His character proved so popular that Davies gave him his own spinoff show, which takes place in the universe of ""Doctor Who,"" but typically has included only hints of the Time Lord, at least during episodes of ""Torchwood.""

Since ""Torchwood"" has premiered, Capt. Jack has appeared in ""Doctor Who,"" in episodes that ultimately are linked back to ""Torchwood."" Barrowman's appearance in ""Utopia"" took place immediately after the first season of ""Torchwood"" where Capt. Jack heard the familiar sounds of the Tardis, and then disappeared.

Barrowman stayed on ""Doctor Who"" through the end of the season -- coming in at the third-to-last episode in the first place.

He would then return in ""The Stolen Earth"" and ""Journey's End"" with Cooper and former ""Torchwood"" star Gareth David-Lloyd, and would make a cameo appearance in David Tennant's final episode, ""The End of Time, Part 2"" on New Year's Day 2010.

That episode, however, was Davies' final episode. He handed the reins over to Steven Moffat, who so far has not really included much from Davies' universe that Moffat hadn't created himself. Because of that, it's unlikely Capt. Jack and Gwen will be paying a visit to The Doctor anyway.

""Torchwood,"" which premieres July 8 on American premium cable channel Starz, moves away from common science-fiction staples like aliens and cool gadgets.

""What I like about this year's version of 'Torchwood' is that it's just a concept,"" Davies said. ""There's some alien fun to come, but it's really taking an idea -- that we all live forever -- [and] dropping it into the middle of society and just watching the waves go out. Watching all of us react. Watching how our society bends, how it falls, how it brings out the best of us and the worst of us.""


I can bold more if need be. But there you go. **The Doctor** has **NEVER** gone into Torchwood, **per the fucking guy that created Torchwood.**",0,1389718465,null,0,false,0,cepd6gw,t3_1v3icy,t1_cepd6gw,t1_cepcv95,null,1431938864,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0

The pps literally picked up the paperwork, and decided not enough evidence.  The guy who hit me, was driven away from the scene, and didnt make him self available for questioning for 3 days.  IN that time, his ""friends and family"" had all statements issued which was a complete mirror image of ""his"" version.

My statement went in literally minutes after i was assulted. I was completly sober at the wedding and genuinly believed things were air tight for me.  Especially since an independent witness spoke to the guy who assulted me straight after the incident to find out why he did it.  His words to him were and i quote "" he had this coming to him for a long time. ""  how can that not be crucial evidence for the pps to consider

In all of these threads the same places always get suggested. If you have a car or your parents are hiring a car and you will have transport then there are some really nice places to eat and drink outside of the city, as well as some good tourist attractions. here are some examples of things to see and do and a couple of restaurants in the county and surrounding areas rather than city centre:


Go to the National Watersports Centre at Gamston  and have a walk around the grounds? (http://www.nwscnotts.com/)

Head over to the Vale of Belvoir (pronounced Beaver) and check out Belvior Castle, which has had the same family and decendants living in it for 500 years (http://www.belvoircastle.com/) - The vale is also a great place to have a walk or drive around, some beautiful villages and scenery, local pubs etc.

Have dinner at Tom Browns restaurant on the Riverside (I love this place) (http://www.tombrowns.co.uk/)
or they have another restaurant at trent bridge by the riverside which is equally lovely (http://www.riverbanknotts.co.uk/)


Visit Belton House and Gardens in Grantham, a Stately home that was built in the 1600's (http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/belton-house)

go to Southwell Minster, where there has been a church on the site for Over 1000 years. (http://www.southwellminster.org/)  - The town/village there is quite nice too. 

Go to Newark and see the Ruins of the Castle in the town centre.

In fact he suggested it was the Irish government who was asking for it.

As usual in Ireland we are stuck with the same issue of people hearing what they want to hear instead of taking an objective look at the situation. People on here are as guilty as anyone else by lambasting Paisley without actually suggesting why they believe he is a bigot (I wouldn't suggest he was a bigot for venomously opposing the RC church, it's well known people of his era didn't hate Roman Catholic people but the actual administration of the church and visa versa) or a fascist (which is even more laughable considering his proposals for the UWC strike was to have an elected government). But as usual people oppose without any substance to their arguments.

If anyone was willing to actually have a proper debate about Paisley without the hate filled bile then let's have it. I'm not in the pro-Paisley camp (I'm an socialist why would I?) but I refuse to go off on hate filled rants ""bigot, fascist, can't wait until he's dead"" or any other of the usual dogmatic crap the pinko liberals in this country have.

cycling in London is fucken horrifying compared to where I live. And where I live I would estimate 1/10-20 don't overtake me correctly. If you think that's not dangerous you're wrong.

Its for this precise reason I bring up my wife and son - I cant expect them to cycle on roads like that - I do because I'm a fast confident cyclist, not every one is, and nor should everyone expect to be.


Roads are there for everyone, biggest and fasted does not get priority past people being considerate. But before I (or my son) can be considerate we need to be safe. 

If taking action to be safe against those who introduce and danger is somehow inconsiderate or wrong I don't know what to say. I doubt anything I could say would change your mind anyway.



&gt;And I can judge what is good reason - I use the roads, I know what cyclists watch out for, it's not rocket science.

I drive and I cycle - I didn't have a clue what cyclists had to look out for before I stated cycling. Anyway. Its a moot point. Bikability teaches you to cycle in the middle of the lane for safety not to inconvenience drivers. That's what I do, and that what (it would seem) the cyclist we are talking about is doing.

&gt;And judging from the comments from more militant cyclists I have seen on road.cc just now, there is plenty of intent to piss off drivers.

Im sure. Militant cyclists no different to militant drivers. Go browse a motoring forum.

Essex on the other hand is well within commuting distance of the capital of the UK and the largest city in Western Europe. I live north of Essex and can still be in central London, from my front door, within 55 minutes by train. The two are not comparable.

That episode was my least favorite. I know, I know, Georgia Moffat is Peter Davison's daughter IRL, but that fact doesn't do anything to redeem the cold hard truth that she can not act. I found her depiction of Jenny to be pretty useless. A combination of Barbie doll meets Catherine Zeta Jones in Entrapment, i.e., the scene where Zeta Jones contorts herself into various suggestive positions to avoid being detected by a laser security system, all while wearing the tightest clothes imaginable. 

It could be that it's all the fault of the script. I just didn't see the character of Jenny as being anything other than something to boost the ""hotness quotient"" of that episode. It was poorly acted making Jenny extremely one dimensional. 

And 1 thing has always bothered me most....so she's ""born"" of the 10th Doctors DNA right? I know that YES, the Doctor regenerates, can look pretty much however he wants &amp;/or ends up, sure he's been a blond in the past...but wouldn't it have made a tiny but more sense for Jenny to LOOK more like the actual 10th Doctor in appearance? He's got dark hair, tall, &amp; from his DNA springs a teeny tiny blonde a foot or more shorter? I'm thinking it's because of his past faces from re-generations that they could explain this away &amp; it would make sense. BUT, so would making Jenny look similar in appearance to the 10th Doctor as he currently looks. 

That, combined with Moffat's terrible acting made the episode seem all the more gratuitous &amp; unneeded. I remember when I first saw this episode actually groaning when Jenny was shown resuscitated &amp; hoping into a ship to fly off. All I could think was ""oh my god I hope this is the end for this character"", for Jenny was well &amp; truly annoying. 

I'll never be able to shake the feeling that Moffat was cast in the role simply because she is IN FACT the actual daughter of 5th doc, Davison. Had to be nepotism, HAD TO BE, bc Moffat brought zero to the performance except a cute ponytail &amp; a few flips. 

Tennant definitely IS a fan of blondes, and dating costars....which has always given me pause...because he dated &amp; broke up with Sophia Myles (Madame de Pompadour- The Girl in the Fireplace, now THAT was a great episode!) less than a year before working w/ Moffat on DW. I can't be the only 1 who thinks Sophia Myles is a 1000 times prettier than Moffat, looks aren't everything, but from what I've seen, Myles appears to be a better actress too.

He is overhyped. When he had his time on the pitch he wasn't nearly as good as any of our other players. I'd rate him on the level of Victor Moses (for camparison) at the highest. Same situation as Kevin De Bruyne. 

&gt;We would of seen some seriously beautiful football to rival MC and Arsenal.

We are already doing that at the moment and we definitely don't need Marin to keep doing this. We're third in the league, 2 points behind Arsenal, 1 point behind City. We are through to the last 16 of the Champions League.

&gt; It pisses me off to see how much potential we had, and what we actually have now, if only Roman didn't sack RDM. 

Seriously? RDM is a legend but he is nowhere near Jose Mourinho concerning football tactics. You are talking about beautiful, attacking football. That's not what RDM did, or did you forget how we won the Champions League? If you did, we won because of a perfect defense system and Drogba. 

We have way more potential today than we had last year or even two years ago. We are only lacking a proper striker and maybe an exrtra CM (which is probably on his way very soon.) 

Building a team around Marin is the worst idea I've ever heard. He hasn't even proven himself to Chelsea, so why would you even change everything to make him comfortable, with the likes of Hazard, Willian and Oscar having no problem to adapt to a new team?

When Napoleon became Emperor he did not just hold power as the French Kings had done, he cleansed the French State of forms of authority that competed against him. His rule was total, hence the name. I'm sure other rulers in history aspired to this, but it wasn't until Napoleon's era that it was practically possible. 

For a modern comparison 


North Korea is a Totalitarian dictatorship because Kim Jung un has the ability to exercise power, even executing people, at will with no checks and balances what so ever. 

Iran by contrast, although in some respects it has a very authoritarian government, is not totalitarian because people have some representation in the political system and their military, religious and secular authorities have the power to challenge each other on some issues.

Another part of what the organization focuses on is not falling into the trap of collecting names just to have them or trying to outbid opponents on high priced assets. That doesn't mean they won't spend money (as they've shown with Suarez), but they won't be dragged into a bad situation out of fear or desperation.

Would it be disappointing to miss out on the top 4 this year and not get to the CL? Very. Does that mean that the ownership group turned their back on us? No way.

But honestly any of the top 4 could win. We have all of them at home and I think if we can make Anfield a fortress then we'll be right up there.

I'm not worried at all about United, Spurs or Everton and here's why:

* **United** - They're currently relying on Giggs and Januzaj. A 40 year old who peaked 13 years ago and an 18 year old who isn't as good as Sterling and has been gaining a reputation for diving. Their two main attacking threats are injured and won't be back until they have CL, when they'll be distracted and their squad thinned and tired. They won last year because it was SAF. Even though he's scum I have to give him credit, he took a mid-table squad with 2 stand out players and got them the title. Moyes can't do that because he's a mediocre manager. They will get 5th if they're lucky.

* **Spurs** - horribly inconsistent. Sherwood is decent and they've looked improved but I still think they'll struggle against top teams, as they did against Arsenal. They have supposedly a very good squad but they just haven't gelled and I don't see them doing it in time. Also Europe will take a lot out of their challenge. 

* **Everton** - Lack of depth and attacking threat will kill their challenge. Lukaku has been off the boil of late and without him they're very very average. Their squad is even thinner than ours and I just don't see them keeping up. 

Not to mention we have the easiest 2nd stretch of any of the top 7 teams.

August 2011-May 2012: Losses of ~£40M (and debt increased to £87M)

August 2010-July 2011: Losses of ~£49M.

August 2009-July 2010: Losses of ~£20M.

I have read that 2013's numbers will be somewhere around £20M to £30M.

Regarding CL and RDM, you either didn't watch any football under RDM, or you're clueless with what you do watch. He came in after AVB ruined our team, we were already in the CL. If you'd like to see how we played under RDM, watch our PL games, not the earlier games.

Beating a prime Barca was quite an achievement with our team, again, we had a poor team and a brand new Manager - We didn't have Hazard, Oscar, Willian - We had Kalou, Bosingwa, Meireles.

I never mentioned building it around Marin, I stated using him with Mata, quite a significant difference.

I get a lot of these replies, and they're just flawed. Comparing our team now to our team under RDM when he was new to the club is a fucking laughable comparison. Watch our games after the CL with RDM and you'll see the beautiful football we played. Rafa used the same style, he didn't change a thing.

That, and wait outside that clump for the ball to squirt out, then tear off down the field with it.  Ever since, I always worked on my weaker left foot to make sure I could play either way, and I always thought that top players did the same.  I scored my first goal outside of the youth leagues with my left foot, beat the keeper at the near post from outside the box, no less...If I had to sit and run a tally, I'd guess maybe 4 in 10 came from my left foot.  I even played left winger for a few seasons, before moving into my more comfortable CM position.  I drilled corner kicks with both feet, and though my accuracy on a cross wasn't great from my left, I picked up plenty of assists.  I never went pro, and I still have 2 seasons of NCAA eligibility (for the non-Yanks, NCAA is the regulatory body for university team sports), and I wasn't a great player - so why the hell can't guys like Bentaleb who came up through an academy not use both feet?

The Russians always assumed we would because we theatened to and aimed weapons at them. Same reason the doctor sat beside the crack at all times he wasn't busy. Think if it as cocking the hammer. 

Also here's the definition of mad note that it specifically says no one will make a first strike. Remember mad is not an offensive plan it's a defensive. 

The doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD) assumes that each side has enough nuclear weaponry to destroy the other side; and that either side, if attacked for any reason by the other, would retaliate without fail with equal or greater force. The expected result is an immediate irreversible escalation of hostilities resulting in both combatants' mutual, total and assured destruction.

The doctrine further assumes that neither side will dare to launch a first strike because the other side will launch on warning (also called fail-deadly) or with secondary forces (a second strike), resulting in unacceptable losses for both parties. The payoff of the MAD doctrine is expected to be a tense but stable global peace.

Shooting and crossing being as difficult to master as it is, I can see the preference for the stronger of the two feet. But passing, no, players should and I think almost all can, play short passes with either foot. Especially, especially, a central midfield player.

We see Gareth Bale types who are obsessed with taking shots on their left, even in obvious situations where they have an easy shot with the right, but that's not common, and again, talking about shooting. In central areas you should be able to pass with one foot and control with the other whichever way you prefer because of your position relative to the players around you.

Bentaleb nearly scored with a shot on the left side of central midfield, being left footed was no issue there, it doesn't become a problem until the angle becomes more extreme the further you move to either touch line.

true,energyi,null,null,"We've got some nasty away fixtures out of the way, those being Man City, Man United, Arsenal, and Everton (may have missed some here). 

On-top of that many of the teams above us have to drop points against each other and we're currently 2 points from 4th (plus our goal difference that we almost certainly won't improve enough to matter for it to be relevant unless we batter a few teams).

We've also got to consider the fact that we're scoring more goals under Sherwood and creating many chances, even when we're not playing very well. 

Perhaps the most important point however is that we've picked up 13 points out of 15 with Sherwood (including a win at Old Trafford) without Sandro and Vertonghen, who in my opinion are two of our most important players. We've also missed Rose, Capoue, Holtby, Townsend, Lamella and Kaboul for much of this period and the rest of the season. We have the return of all of these players, plus the emergence of Bentaleb seemingly out of nowhere, to look forward to and this can only strengthen us and potentially offset the end of a potential honeymoon period with regards to Sherwood.

There's every chance that the lack of depth in the Everton squad could be their undoing, similar to the situation we've been in in recent seasons. This could leave us in a strong top 5 position and then it will IMO be Liverpool that we need to overcome for top 4 making the match at Anfield very important.

**TL:DR** 
We may not be favourites for a top 4 but there are many positives such as injured players returning, our away form, and the difficult fixtures we've got out of the way. Cautious optimism is my take on our chances.

I also mention [Jam Cafe](http://www.jamcafe.info/) in here every other week but it really is a good place for something to eat and live music.

A trip to Southwell might be nice for them. Has a 1000 year old Minster and its a nice place to walk about for a little while. Plenty of pubs and places to eat.

If you want a walk by the river then head over to Gunthorpe (its on your way to Southwell). After your quick walk there are loads of places to eat. I'd recommend [Tom Browns](http://www.tombrowns.co.uk/). They also have a place on Trent Bridge called [The Riverbank](http://www.riverbanknotts.co.uk/)

Now this might be a bit of a stretch for you but if you can why not think about [Warwick Castle](http://www.warwick-castle.com/)? If you do have a car then its only about an hour and a bit way. Not often your parents will be visiting the UK and it is a pretty cool place to visit. Well, it was for me back when I was 10 or 11.

Its important that buyers take more than just price into account.

Local does not simply list the cheapest first, it uses other metrics to put trusted and cheap sellers at the top.

Bitbargain uses the bitrating system and also limits the amount an unverified buyer can buy to try to prevent money laundering.

There are so many horror stories of people having their bank accounts frozen because they have dealt with shady people, cheapest doesnt always mean best and if the price is too good to be true it almost certainly is.

I think you need to add some kind of rating system in.
Also you should show the min/max amount the seller is offering because often they will undercut everyone by 10% because they are selling some ridiculous increment like £5

The concept of the transfer fee does not apply. In general, a player or players are traded straight up for another player or set of players. Or, free agents(the equivalent of a changing teams on a free) can sign with any team at whatever salary they can negotiate.

In addition, when players are traded, their existing salary contract goes with them.

So, that year, the Red Sox traded some of their young up and coming players to the Padres for a star player, Adrian Gonzalez, and then signed Gonzalez to an improved contract, as he would have been able to leave on a free, i.e. become a free agent at the end of that season. That's why the Padres traded him. They couldn't afford a new contract with him, so they traded him for prospects.

Crawford was already a free agent, so he just signed a contract with the team that would pay him the most, the Red Sox.

Gonzalez got about $154 million over 7 years in his new deal, and Crawford got around $142 over 7 years in his deal with the Sox.

So, it was't $300 million all at once. It was about $42 million a year for those two in salary, and some prospects to the Padres at the time of the trade.

true,lbspredh,null,null,"&gt; They are nationalists, most of them. The same applies to BNP and even recent article from the internal UKIP forums said that at least 80% of BNP supporters will most probably join UKIP. I'm sorry, if someone from the party says so, there is something dodgy going on. Cameron wants to reform EU and even quit it if people vote for that. He doesn't behave like a typical nationalist twat, like Farage does. Have you read Farage's manifesto regarding immigrants? 

nationalists is said like a terrible thing but all it really means is that they are primarily interested in what's best for their country. the BNP are undeniably bad but it's not the fault of UKIP if a scant few of their policies happen to align with BNP nonesense.

&gt;EU citizens who have been established in the UK for seven years or more will, depending on their circumstances, be able to apply for permanent leave to remain (provided they fulfil certain criteria and are eligible to apply for work permits).*
Do you know what it means? Not hard to guess it means deporting all who have been in UK for less than 7 years but came LEGALLY under EU law. If that's not racist (deporting someone only because of nationality, whatever his situation is in UK and sole fact he came here legally) is fucking VERY wrong.

exactly why is that fucking very wrong or anything to do with racism? are they citizens? no they are not citizens they currently have a right to work here but nobody promised them the right to stay forever and it would not be unreasonable or in actual fact deportation to discontinue their unconditional right to work here if a new government decided so. they are not saying deport people who are citizens of foreign birth why exactly is that such a fucking terrible thing? 

&gt;All would be fine if at least Farage donated money to charity. At least fucking half of it!!! He makes ""cynical"" protest but uses that money. Would you take free money knowing it came from drug selling? Plenty of people would and wouldn't find any problem with it, no moral compassion. I would probably take... but would donate all of it to a charity helping drug users.

no it would be a good thing if they donated id, like I said self serving,not callign UKIP saints or anything but as it stands there is nothing bad about taking the money, that's all I'm trying to say I know I'm looking like a UKIP lover right now but I just read your posts and think that your argument in this article is unreasonable and not objective.

as for the drug money I would take it simply because I want money and it deprives the drug dealer of his ill gotten gains(unless it was a benign drug dealer with strict rules on what they sell and to whom) 

&gt;Not many in percentage. Many in numbers (like whole cities). The BNP put forward candidates for 338 out of 650 seats for the 2010 general election[148] gaining 563,743 votes
Funnily, BNP doesn't have ""many"" supporters but when 700k Poles come into UK - FUCKING FLOODS OF IMMIGRANTS. Nice rhetoric.

but numbers are irrelevant with as large a population as the uk, 0.8% of the population are racist but that's not unusual in any country some people just are

as for nice rhetoric it's not my rhetoric I agree that blaming immigrants for all of our problems is bad shit, I just don't agree with your take on this issue

&gt;They would probably say so but mainly because they do indeed lack brains.

again you feel this way because of a difference in moral views not because they have done anything stupid.

&gt; My goals are liberal and not liberal-extreme. UKIP is pretty much far right extreme (not as extreme as BNP though - at least officially).

your assumption that liberal views are the only acceptable views is pretty closed minded and not very liberal at all if you dont mind me saying, and your comparison of UKIP to the BNP is pretty much baseless.

&gt;Deporting people just because of their nationality is generally wrong and you have a hint they plan doing so as described above. 

no it's really not generally wrong we do not by any majority moral view owe people of other nationalities citizenship and job rights in our country, and if we left the EU we would be under no obligation morally or otherwise to continue to allow them those rights simply because we allowed them before. and even if you disagree with that it's a huge leap from that policy to the naziism you are implying

&gt;Supporting BNP is even worse as the party is clearly racist and yes, they would also say the same about me (that I must lack brains) but I'm not against people just because of their origin and because British race is the greatest. Some people should do more reading, for example about Nazis or Apartheid and visit some places (like death camps at Poland) so they could feel to their bones what being far right nationalist person is like. I bet most of them stay in their cosy homes and haven't even seen a foreign national personally but have the most to say about them and the whole topic.

UKIP in no way supports or condones the BNP, and I agree that the BNP is just evil but you are using the same arguments against UKIP that just do not match their actions based upon your dislike of their closed minded views on immigration and the EU",0,1389736134,null,0,false,0,ceplnkh,t3_1v14vy,t1_ceplnkh,t1_cep732i,null,1431942928,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

At the end of my lease and choosing to move on, there was some discrepancies about the return of my deposit. The agent said the landlord had a number of issues, I won't bore you with the details but standard ""place not clean"" all nonsense, it was spotless, cleaner than when I had moved in. 

Anyway, short story 

1. Contacted said deposit protection companies, deposit not enrolled.

2. Spoke to agent on the phone ""must be some kind of mistake mate of course it's invested in the protection scheme"" - yeah right.

3. Visited https://www.moneyclaim.gov.uk/ and registered claim for x 3 times amount of deposit in this case £1,800. As per my legal right. Cost £40.00 

4. Left agent voicemail and posted copy of claim form through his office letter box (he would of received an official copy from the court anyway detailing my claim.)

5. Next day got a phone call saying he would be round to give me £600 deposit in cash.

6. Withdrew case via telephone. 

Generally the threat of taking someone or a company to court  the associated hassle and expense is enough to make them cough up. I have done this twice now, once for this tenancy related issue, and one after not being paid final wages for a temporary summer call centre job, both were successful.

If you need any further advice, whilst in no way am I a legal professional I'll endeavour to help a fellow redditor in anyway I can, drop me a PM.

Edit: I forgot to mention something important.

Also, I think that ""impatience"" is supposed to be ""patience"" in that last paragraph.  But he gets at some interesting things, particuarly how much effect Sherwood has on the player moves.

You'd think that Levy and Baldini would limit his influence until they know whether or not he's going to be here.  Don't want to sell off player to please a guy and then let him go.  So the question is, if Holtby goes is it because Sherwood is likely to stay and didn't want him, or was it a business decision on Levy's part.  Of course, Holtby's desires are also relevant.  He wants to play, and could be leaving if he feels he won't get that opportunity here.

Point is there are a lot of explanations for this potential move, and we likely won't know which one(s) played a part anytime soon.

It is only The Time War that is Time Locked. Fixed points just exist. We don't know why, they just do. The Time Lock was more of an artificially induced fixed point. The War wasn't naturally a fixed point but to ensure it ended and *stayed* ended The Doctor Inflicted the Time Lock.

By pure luck Dalek Caan broke through the Doctor's Time Lock. Maybe at a weak point or some pseudo-science mumbo jumbo. However, breaking through it drove him insane and allowed him to see all of the Universe and he saw how insignificant Daleks were. That is why he becomes more anti-dalek.

For a Sci-Fi show I think the explanations are good enough to not be contradictory. However, I still want a logical explanation on how everyone chanting Doctor at some satellites made him grow young again, float and get a force field. (referring to The Last of The Time Lords).

tldr;

Fixed points exist naturally. Impossible to change unless you are River Song in which case all of time collapses in on itself and happens all at once.

true,sacredstones,null,null,"2 reasons I think this way.

First is from a tactical perspective. In most sports, teams touted as ""The best defense"" always win against teams touted as ""the best offense"". This happens in every Superbowl. this happened with Mourinho's inter. This happened with Di Matteos Chelsea against barca. Defense wins games. You might say that getting goals is the most important thing. and it is. But in order to get goals consistently, you need a solid foundation to attack from. The obvious role of the DM is to protect the back four and snuff attacks. But less obvious role is to facilitate play in order to allow fullbacks and fellow midfielders to advance. Lucas constantly does this. distributing the ball into space or making a splitting pass into a pocket of space. This allows the team to reorganize higher up the pitch. Once this happens, an attack starts and the DM's job transitions. Now the DM has to watch the attack and contain any clearances. He's like a Lid on a pressure cooker. If you look at the post, and see his heat map you'll see that when he's above the halfway line, he's covering the ENTIRE width of the pitch. this is because the attack can only come from one side. So he has to read the game and decide the best place to be to contain any potential clearances or outlet passes. Lucas does this well. So all in all, the DM's role has shifted from breaking play and winning the ball to distributing the ball to the attackers and finally containing the ball in the opponents half. Without a good DM, its much more risky for a team to throw numbers forward. Having a good DM means your ENTIRE team is under less pressure and will play more confidently. The Goalie and Back four know they are shielded well, the midfielders know that they can advance when needed, and the attackers benefit from the the advanced midfielders and very often from the DM himself if they decide to drop deep. From a tactical standpoint, Midfield has always been the most important role. Now in modern times I think the DM role has emerged to be even more important as we see a general rise in talent. Midfielders want to get forward more often, and need to get forward in order to contribute to goals. The DM allows this all to happen. 


The second reason has more to do with our squad depth. When Suarez got banned, Sturridge filled in just fine for him. When Sturridge got injured, we still had Suarez. If Sahko gets injured, we have Toure or Agger to choose from. The only good cover we have for Lucas is Allen. he is the only other player on our team that is intelligent enough to play the role. Stevie is learning, but he was pretty horrid against stoke. Allen had a great run of games in the holding spot when Lucas was injured, but it took a toll on him and he eventually got injured. Even now, He got injured while playing a very defensive role. We're going to have to manage him carefully because it seems like he gets injured every time he plays regularly. So we have have no cover for what I think is the most important role and thats why I think Lucas is currently our most important player. 

He's also a great guy and a leader for the team. ",0,1389741048,null,0,false,0,cepo1sl,t3_1v7uoy,t1_cepo1sl,t1_cepmdm0,null,1431944068,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

Regardless, that's besides the point. With Lucas, we do have other players who can do a good job there; Gerrard is learning to play it and Allen looked back in form before his injury. You have to look are the difference between the best player for a position and his replacement. Lucas and Allen, in my opinion, offer different things and are both similar quality in my opinion (although most would argue Lucas is much better I think he has yet to get back to his best). Suarez is the best player in the world on current form, any replacement for him is always going to be a bigger downgrade than previously mentioned, Migs and Jones speaks for itself, Sakho is our best defender by a mile imo, and Sturridge is less so from a depth sense since we have Suarez but still improves the team immeasurably because he combines with Suarez so well.

true,sacredstones,null,null,"Just because suarez is the best player on the pitch doesn't make him the most important. Is messi the most important player for Barca? no. Who is? Many would say Busquets. We did just fine with Sturridge+coutinho. Sturridge gave us a strong start. If Suarez was indeed our most important player, then we would have been suffering in games. I'm sure I'm not the only one that was confident despite suarez's absence. Sturridge had it locked down and got us wins. but when Lucas was still injured beginning of last season? Allen as replacement, but we still struggled. Not even Suarez (who was still really fucking good at that time) could bring us out of that slump. we ended up drawing many of the games and thats when people were complaining that we couldn't get out of our own half. IMO, that was because we were missing Lucas. I don't think its ludacris at all.

Gerrard did not do a good job there. He was too torn between his old role and the new role. he wasn't terrible, but he was much worse than Lucas. Would you really want him in place of Lucas against Everton? The thing about Allen is that every time he gets a run of games he gets injured. His body can't deal with the physicality at the moment, so he's not reliable backup. even then, he has a tendency to advance higher up whereas Lucas is very disciplined. he's our only true DM and as i've explained before, I think the DM role is the most important role in the game.

Theism: Belief in (a) god(dess)(es). Isn't limited to any particular religion. Includes lack of religion, for the minority who believe in a divine person or several, but don't follow any religions.

Agnosticism: Belief that the existence of such cannot be known. Agnosticism is rarely an exact balance, and agnostics usually lean towards either theism or atheism.

Atheism: Belief that there is no such thing as (a) god(dess)(es). Can be part of a religion, though is mostly attributed to a lack thereof.

...and then there's me. I absolutely will not accept the idea of a bearded bloke in the sky who hands out smarties and blue peter badges when you die and likes to touch random American people. To that end, I'm an atheist.

However, I think that the original concept of 'god' was a catch-all term to describe the laws of physics, the forces of nature and everything else that's far more powerful than all of mankind combined. By defining the word 'god' this way, it creates a grey area, because no amount of reasoning can tell me gravity doesn't exist, or that earthquakes aren't something to be feared.

Sterling -------------------------------- Salah

Looks kind of unbalanced -- we'd get crushed in the midfield.
As it stands, our midfield continues to be a problem that needs sorting out. I thought we had our best balance with Lucas holding, Allen/Hendo advanced. Work-rate, passing, pressing, possession were the most sound. But Gerrard still does not look like he's going to be dropped, so as long as he's fit, Rodgers will play him.

I'm starting to become curious as to what a true table-topping Liverpool will look like under BR.

He was fine playing regularly at swansea, but he's still so young and long term fatigue may be setting in. I think the Gerrard drop off is pretty substantial.

a lot of teams can do it, but if you look at the top teams there is always a DM, who usually gets a lot of recognition. Busquets at Barca, Khedira/alonso at RM, Garcia at Bayern, Masch when he was with us, Carrick for Man U, Arteta/flamini for arsenal...the list goes on. I remember watching the CL final last season and I really feel that Schwieni and Garcia won that game for Bayern. The were breaking up all the attacks and recycling possession as well as starting attacks. then you have Arsenal fans dreading when Arteta got hurt and rejoicing when Flamini came in. I don't watch enough of their games, but the fans were gushing about what an impact it made.  A genuine DM is an important role and is becoming more and more important. Lets look at the Brazil team. You have Ramires and Paulinho who are DM's, but both love getting forward. Then you have Lucas. I'm guessing that in the end, Lucas is going to get a majority of starts over both of them because he is an out and out DM.

true,AyCarrumba,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"It's a sensible question, but one that you really need a decent appreciation of what ""A thousand metres underground"" means. And also what frac'ing actually entails.

The fundamental thing to understand is that frac'ing only needs to open up  pathways in the rock the make it *permeable*. The rock is already *porous* - it holds gas that we want to extract. The problem is that these pores are not interconnected in any substantial way, so the gas remains trapped.

When conducting a frac, it's only necessary to ""crack"" tiny pathways into the reservoir rock, and hold them open - hence the addition of propants like sand or manufactured ceramics. This allows the gas to flow out to the collection point.

Many rocks exhibit this kind of cracking already: the bedding and jointing in sandstones, for example, which make them easy to exploit because the rock is all interlinked. We artificially induce this kind of cracking into a rock. The cracks opened up are tiny, but far reaching, to ensure good recovery.

The rock won't end up weakened by any substantial amount. The pressures at the depth we're talking about are huge, and remember rocks are layered and supported by the rocks above and below. We're not opening up large void spaces that the earth above could collapse into. It's like taking a layer of shale (itself not the strongest of rocks) and replacing it with a layer of cracked shale - beneath and above thousands of feet of shales, muds, sandstones, salt layers - every kind of sedimentary rock found locally. The pressure acts to hold it all together, and act through the propants once the pressure used to actually fracture the rock is relieved.

So I understand where you're coming from, because in ""pumping large volumes of water into the rock"" you imagine it opening up big caverns. What we're actually talking about is between 1 and 5 swimming pools worth, acting over a few square kilometers. As for underground erosion/changing the course of underground waterways, you're thinking waaaaayyyyy too shallow! They only exist at the boundary of the water table - literally rivers running underground where the water table is not expressed at the ground surface. That's 10m-a few 100's of metres at most. We're talking 1000m at shallowest for frac'ing. The rock down there is waterlogged if it's porous and permeable, and dry if it's not.

Hope that helps!

true,wrigley2345,eng-dorset,Dorset (Living in USA),"Here's a brief summary of what I submitted -

**Circle 1 - Those who did not settle with mediocrity**

The strive for happiness in England is not really acceptable and as such the ultimate aim is to be merely ok.
Here, any unnecessary show of high spiritedness results in a massive pain down your whole right side. This pain increases exponentially with each offence.

In regards to the question, ‘You alright?’

Some approved replies to this question include, but are not limited to;
""yeah""
""could be better""
""not bad""
""still alive""
“Mustn't grumble”

**Circle 2 - Cyclists**

Designated for Cyclists who commute. They are confined to a cordoned off area of london, around 5 square miles of it.hey have to negotiate the heavy rush of traffic, which is populated by certain members of circle 1 who have been deemed sufficiently de-moralised. The cyclists on this busy dangerous road, with angry and bitter drivers clogging it up have to keep riding for eternity. If they fall off, or are hit, too bad. They have only a few seconds before they have to get up and continue their ride.

**Circle 3 - Queue Jumpers**

For breaking the sacred, unwritten rule of the English queue, they shall be forced to be in a Job Center Plus queue for just a little under eternity. When they come to the front, they are told that the form they filled out was the Blue one, when they are in fact required to hand in the Magenta one. They are then sent back to the start to do it all over again. The tube network is used to contain the massive single-file line.

**Circle 4 - Tabloid Journalists**

In a massive, dark pit in the ground, they find themselfs with a digestive system similar to that of a rabbit, in that you are only able to absorb the proper amount of nutrient for life by sending food through your digestive system multiple times. *(Credit to /u/HohumPole)*

**Circle 5 - Immigrants**

They have a program that they have to start when they come here, where they have to unlearn their foreign tongue, and learn fluent English. They then take a ‘patriation course’ where they learn all of the ins and outs of English culture. Then they are sent here to be shipped off to Spain where they act like English immigrants.

**Circle 6 - The Scottish**

Their punishment is simply having to live in England, without being able to cross any borders or cross any seas. Technically, the 6th circle isn’t in London like the other ones are. They are free to wander around the whole country, to do anything they want. It’s still torture for them though. That’s what they get for wanting to be ‘independent.’’

**Circle 7 - The French**

Circle 7, or the M25, is for the French. Hundreds of thousands of Citroens, Peugeots and Renaults are clogged up on it, with all the exits blocked off by steel-gates. They are stuck in the 177 mile loop for eternity, with the occasional petrol station to break off some of the monotony.

**Circle 8 - Crooked Politicians**

They take up residence in any abandoned house they can find in an abandoned part of town. If they are lucky enough to find a job, they can take it. But they can’t earn more than the minimum wage of the country at the time when they were in office. The majority however cannot find jobs, and are forced to live off Jobseekers allowance money allocated to them every week.

**Circle 9 - Chavs**

This circle is Slough, but cordoned off by armed guards. ‘In Slough, alcohol is banned. The only clothes stores are too expensive so they have to live in their old dirty clothes. Classical music is blared into every street. Education is compulsory. Swearing is banned. They are limited to one child per family, and they are unable to get benefit money. It absolutely destroys their souls.

*Suddenly, a huge deep, satanic roar echoed out from behind a row of houses. The whole ground shook like there was an earthquake. Suddenly, the row of houses collapsed and the origin of the sound made itself known. The top half of a giant man protruded from a huge hole in the road. His head alone was about 7 feet tall. He had a multitude of long hands protruding from his back. With the longest one, he reached down and picked a sobbing chav from a park bench. The giant shrieked, in a terrifying deep bellow, ‘THE DNA TEST RESULTS ARE HERE - YOU ARE THE FATHER’, and then promptly ate the poor youth. Stephen physically recoiled. The face of the beast looked strangely familiar….

‘This, is Jeremy Kyle. The most evil thing that inhabits hell. He spends eternity trapped in slough, picking up dejected chavs and eating them. They land in his stomach, where they are burned by a bile formed of smugness and obnoxiousness.*

true,AyCarrumba,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; I still have concerns about the actual process - i.e. pumping huge amounts of water and chemicals underground and any potential side effects of this.

""Large amounts"" is all relative. A typical frac requires about 1-5 Megalitres, or 5 olympic swimming pools worth. A pretty mediocre drinking water borehole in the UK can sustainably produce that amount in a day - there are many thousands like this across the country. However, you don't use treated potable water to frac! It's wasteful. You can pump water from pretty much anywhere and use that instead. Even saline water if you're near the coast.

&gt; water itself is a scarce resource, despite the UKs high rainfall. Where does the large amount of water needed for fracking come from? Is this going to impact the quality of our rivers? How effective will the treatment of waste water be before it is released?

I'd say the treatment of waste water is a valid concern. Much of the water actually stays down the well, but some is recovered, ad it must be properly treated before release. We do have very strong regulations in the UK about discharge of any water with toxicity. That is one of those things that will simply have to be 'done correctly'. That said, frac'ing fluid isn't the worst stuff in the world. Effluent from gold mining or other mineral processes are WAAAAAY worse (not that something else being worse is a reason to ignore something pretty bad). Point is, we know how to process the fluids used so that they pose no threat to the environment. You've probably thrown worse stuff down the bog without a second though as to how it's dealt with.

As I've already said, the actual volumes of water involved are really not that great. A decent sized factory would get through the same volume of water in a day, day after day. A frac'ing site uses it in a one off event to conduct the frac, then again once it needs to conduct further frac'ing to extend the life of the well.

The political issues are just that - and I'd argue that they're most important. I'm in Australia, and I've seen how the Aussies have squandered the profits from a decade long mineral boom. The UK needs to capture and use Frac'ing revenue to give it a leg up into the next era: Attack debt, invest in future energy resources. Done right, I think it oculd be the kind of windfall we all dream of to give us a march on the future. Done wrong, we'll have good reason to hate Politicians even more.",0,1389752161,null,0,false,0,cept3nn,t3_1v53hs,t1_cept3nn,t1_cep6cfh,null,1431946557,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,DC_Coach,null,null,"Given the name of this thread it's probably important for me to reiterate that I absolutely don't hate the 9th doctor, nor do I hate Chris Eccleston. In fact I love the 9th doctor; I remain, however, disappointed in CE as an actor and person, given his attitude and stance concerning Doctor Who.

I will agree with your second point, that Chris Eccleston (not the 9th doctor, I'm referring to the actor) wouldn't have gelled in the 50th in the War Doctor's stead. But IMHO that's all on CE, as an actor and person. 

For many years now he has had nothing for Doctor Who beyond refraining from publicly slagging it or the people behind it. We all know this, and IMO it would have been awkward to see him there like that, hamming it up, especially if the role was as big as it turned out to be. If somehow the 9th doctor - the character CE plays in the 2005 season - could have been in the 50th, then I believe it could have worked. And therein lies the rub.

A 60 second regen scene with a ""Fantastic!"" thrown in would have helped immensely with many of us who are disappointed in him. Just as a shout-out to the fans to show he cares about them, or to show he cares about the character, if nothing else, right? Assuming he does. Again, the rub.

I can appreciate the viewpoints and thoughts written here, while respectfully disagreeing with the first paragraph. Peter Davison has gone above and beyond, appearing several times, as has Sylvester McCoy. Not just Doctors, how about Elisabeth Sladen? Paul McGann jumped at the chance to be in the mini-episode and I don't think anyone believes he wouldn't have played the War Doctor in the 50th. Tom Baker! And I honestly don't see Matt Smith refusing to talk about his role as The Doctor, or refusing to appear for, or on, the show, so long as it's practical; or demanding that a specific director be used. That one is just beyond me. To me it makes CE look weak or petty, or something.

So CE saw it as just another role. Unfortunately I can agree with that, too, given the evidence, but you must admit that most of the rest of the DW alumni, and I'm not just talking about the doctors, didn't see it as just another role.

Think of other shows you've watched, and old favorite characters that have returned to the show. It is a gift to the fans who love seeing old, beloved characters return. These actors aren't ALL people who've watched a show since they were kids.

Finally, I mentioned this before but it bears repeating: Murray Gold indicated that Chris was over the moon about DW while screen testing for his role as 9, and Chris specifically praised the story of ""Father's Day."" 

It took me a few minutes to find the video of this because it keeps getting blocked :-( ... but I finally found a live one. You should watch the whole thing, seriously it's awesome and of course Murray Gold has become as important to our show as the actors or writers. But for the purposes of this conversation start right around the 12 minute mark, and listen to Murray describe what Chris had to say: http://guru.bafta.org/murray-gold-conversations-with-composers

So. What happened between then and after Chris left?

If he'd been kicked from the show, if there had been a public falling out, if the show had bombed horribly, any of those things or a number of other things might make sense. Sadly, IMO, without knowing more, specifically about the circumstances of the ""bad work environment"" about which, so far as I know, nobody else has ever had anything to say, I'm afraid many of us won't ever be able to give CE much benefit of the doubt. We will therefore naturally hold his refusals against him. 

Not that he cares! Or that it's any of our business, necessarily, don't misunderstand, I can't speak for everyone but I'm not grieving over all of this or anything, I'm just participating in a discussion, and it's just a television show. I'm just saying, as respectfully as I can, that some of us have tried all along to meet CE more than halfway on all this, but at this point in time it has been quite difficult to appreciate his side of things.",0,1389753585,null,0,false,0,ceptqfo,t3_1v4x1v,t1_ceptqfo,t1_cepbem9,null,1431946801,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

English is not a Welsh language; Welsh is the native language of the Welsh people. So do you feel embarrassed when speaking English in Wales? English is also an official language in India. So is India too an exception?

&gt;it is a historic language, and should be kept one

Except that it has about 750,000 speakers today, and that number is growing. Welsh literature is being published daily, Welsh is being spoken daily, and there is a rich cultural history confined to that language. If the Welsh language dies so does much of the Welsh culture, and thus the spirit of the Welsh people. I'm proud of my culture, and I wish for my children to grow up in a world where that culture continues to thrive and is not engulfed through law by another culture which has tried to strangle my culture throughout history. I want it to live side by side with British culture, and it can.

Wales is a bilingual country, and in my experience anyone you come across will be happy to speak with you in English if you don't know the native language of Wales. Simply because someone else doesn't know the language does not restrict your right to use it with other people who do. English speakers are not outcasts in Welsh society; how is the use of my own tongue with other speakers of it rude?

&gt;“The oil industry is correct in saying they have been fracking for some time. What is new is the widespread deployment and possible fracking for shale gas.”

&gt;Prof Davies explained that unlike fracking for conventional oil and gas, fracking for shale gas requires multiple wells and has only happened in Lancashire so far, where it caused a small earthquake. 

And goes on to summarize my position:

&gt; “For me the fracking is not the problem, it is the number of wells and the traffic,” he added. 

Although I'd add that its not just fracking, theres a lot of urbanisation and industrialization of the UK landscape going on right now. Close to me a company bought a woodland, then hollowed it out and put hardstanding down to make a hidden car park out of it.",0,1389754714,null,0,false,0,cepu8dl,t3_1v53hs,t1_cepu8dl,t1_cepsubz,null,1431947036,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

So when Bale was getting sold and there was another player that needed to go to bring some cash in we went for Ozil. Other teams may have come in with bigger bids for him but he had already met with Wenger and been sold his vision. So Bale going there did have a real impact on us getting Ozil.

true,daveime,eng-lancashire,Lancashire / Philippines,"&gt; Does someone who earns £10million 50 times the average UK salary spend 50 times as much in the economy?

And yet that same ONE person earning £10million pays around £4.5million in tax, while not consuming any more services / resources than any other person (in fact one could argue they consume less, you won't find the Earl of Buckley in an NHS ward, or using the Citizens Advice Bureau). 

Does *that* seem ""fair""? That one person pays the same tax by himself as 42 other people combined ... because that's how the figures work out. The top 1% of earners are paying 29.8% of the income tax.

And this isn't ""fat cat millionaires"" ... it's anyone who's earning a 160 grand a year or more. It's the skilled surgeons, doctors, professors, bank managers *also* ... 400,000 people we really don't want to lose to the brain drain just because of some petty jealousy issues.

Well... Yes to both of those. I believe ""clinging on"" to Welsh as a piece of our national heritage is essential. Welsh is the language of Wales. Because it is an old language, because it is a living language, and because of the mass of knowledge and culture in that language; that is why it is worth fighting for, as you said. This is why people still speak different languages today, no? If the preservation of languages is not 'essential' we might as well all start speaking one language and destroy the culture, ideas and history of every nation.

&gt;Welsh is an ancient language, so who decided on the Welsh for Bus, Ambulance, Police officer given that these didn't exist when the Welsh language was mainstream?

Doesn't that also work with every language? I don't see the point. English saw the days when these things didn't exist. English evolved from Proto-Germanic as Welsh was evolving from Brythonic.

Ok... so I decided something a bit wonky.  I'm really a sucker for Matt Jarvis. He has a great work rate and wonderful pace, but Vaz Te found the net. He was a bit of an odd player in the mix, but him and Morrison paired well together.  Since he's been out, Morrison hasn't done very much. 

I think the biggest problem is that Noble doesn't have anyone to split responsibilities with as CDM. He's solid and sorting out the middle of the pitch, but I think MOrrison does a better job of controlling the pace of the game than Diame does. Diame wants to attack... but he never really finds himself in a place to shoot and he doesn't play in that many interesting balls.  I'd maybe even swap Collison for Morrison in this lineup.

I understand why you've chosen MtGox as a price reference (because they're the only one that provides a GBP API); it's just a shame that MtGox's prices are currently about 10% above the other exchanges.  As such, most sellers (even Bittylicious), will always have lower prices.

Personally, when deciding who to buy from, I look at the price (in EUROs) at Kraken, convert to GBP via my bank's exchange rate (which is 1.15 at best), add on a SEPA fee, and then see if anyone at localbitcoins is cheaper (they usually are, which is why I rarely end up actually sending Kraken any money).

It remains to be seen how much Holt's is going to play, though he's definitely going to get some time. I hope Lambert uses Holt to help ease in the younger strikers. Though Holt's getting up in years, physical strength doesn't deteriorate as much as other qualities, and he can definitely wear down opposing center backs.

Overall, I think it's a shrewder signing than some believe it to be.

Lampard can have a little more freedom, or the likes of Mata can come in and do what they do best. Playing an open, fast paced game? Ramires and Matic.
