Did he? How do you know? All the information and quotes from both the manager and player seem to point to it being a very amicable transfer from all sides and for the best of all parties concerned.

I'm pleased for him, he wanted to stay at and play football at a top flight club in England, the club have graciously allowed him to do that for a good transfer fee.

If you want to start conspiritard theories about motives behind the transfer, then at least back it up with something other than ""this is what it was probably like or this is a no brainer"" It's speculative bullshit that goes against and is disrespectful to the statements from all camps.

Juan. -- Hi everyone, As you can imagine this is a very important day in my life, and with these lines I would like to express the memories and emotions that come to me as I write. 

This letter is written from my heart, and first of all I would like to say that I will never forget all the affection given to me by the Chelsea fans. From the very first day until the last. With your support and affection I have grown up as a player and I have had an amazing time both on and off the pitch. I will always feel the gratitude towards you. Always. No words are enough to give back all the things I have received. 

There has been plenty of good moments: the FA Cup, my first trophy as a Blue; the immense happiness of winning titles for the first time in the club's history, such as that magical Champions League night in Munich and the Europa League... 

On the other hand, I have experienced some complicated situations from a personal point of view, mainly during the last six months. Every message I got through the social media, every nice word you have said to me on the street, and of course, your support in the stadium, has made me feel incredibly proud of the Chelsea fans; you deserve a team like the one you've got, with so many fantastic players. I won't forget the faith you put in me when I was given the player of the year award the last two seasons. I feel really proud and I will never forget those nights. Thank you so much for the way you have treated me, you have been unbelievable. 

I hope you understand that after going through a complicated and, for me, new situation in the last few months, I believe this is the best choice in order to carry on with my football career and to keep enjoying this sport. Before last summer, my intention was to stay here for a long time; as long as the club wanted me to, and to keep winning trophies for Chelsea FC. This is how happy I was in the club and in the city. 

However, as you all know, things changed after the preseason. From feeling like an important player, I started to experience some difficult situations and I felt unable to help the team to the extent that I wanted and was used to. Obviously, I fully respect the circumstances. Football is a team sport and it's not easy to play regularly in such a good squad. In sports you may win or lose, but the most important thing is to give everything. I hope you know and feel that I have always done so. In every game, in every training session, without exception. I have always tried my best for the club. 

I would like to emphasise the affection, admiration and respect that I've had for my former team mates since the first day. I want to thank the captains for their help and understanding at all times. They made me feel comfortable when I arrived and they have supported me throughout the difficult times this season. I thank all my former team mates for these two and a half years and I wish them the best, personally and professionally, for the future. 

Of course I have been closer to some of them, but the most important thing is that my years in Chelsea have left me with great friends. Friends forever, football rivalries aside. I also want to highlight the day-to-day job of every member of the Chelsea staff: medical team, kit men, staff at Cobham and Stamford Bridge, media and marketing department, Chelsea TV team... All of them are very important in making this club a great one. Thank you for your treatment and your efforts to make the life of the players easier. 

Furthermore, thanks to every manager (that's a dig) I have had the pleasure to work with during my time here. They have all been a big help for my progression as a player. I have always respected their decisions, whatever they were; they made me more mature and a stronger person. You learn from everything, and certain situations make you think about other team mates who are coping with similar situations more regularly.

 Thank you Andre for giving me the opportunity to join Chelsea FC. Without your support, none of this would have happened. To Robbie and Rafa, for their unlimited trust in me. And to Jose, for making me a stronger player, because in difficult moments, I have learnt to remain positive and to keep working hard. Lastly, I want to thank the Club, and in particular its owner, Roman Abramovich, for trusting me and making an important investment when signing me. 

Also for their understanding regarding my situation over the last months. I'm very glad to have been part of the squad that made his and our dream come true: winning the Champions League on that unforgettable night in Munich. 

Additionally, my years in Chelsea have been profitable for the club, which I'm very pleased about. I want to make clear that the stage that now comes to an end has been extremely important for me, personally and professionally. Although many of you, like myself, never thought this moment would come, this is football and a new chapter is about to begin. I would have liked to say good bye to all of you in the stadium, or in a press conference, but it has not been possible. I'm sure, i will be able to do it in the future, because is what you deserve. 

Evidently, today is a day of mixed feelings, remembering the past and looking forward to the future and what it has to bring. I look forward to being happy and to enjoy what I like the most: play football. I will never forget my time in Chelsea and the affection I take with me, I will keep forever. 

I wish you the best. A big hug to all of you.

true,MrBushido2318,eu,European Union,"McDonalds didn't colonise the planet, it started with a city.

There are tons of useful things we can do in space. Mining asteroids for precious minerals would be a good start:

1) It helps alleviate inhibiting costs for more ambitious projects. Instead of having to fabricate things on earth and launch them, you have the possibility of simply mining an asteroid and using those resources to build larger space stations. All you need to do is get 1 ""industrial"" station in to space that has the facilities to make other stations and after that you have exponential growth.

2) Asteroids are probably the biggest threat to us. If we are actively mining asteroids then we're likely to know what asteroids are close to us, and their composition for their potential profits. Since mining asteroids would require the ability to go to asteroids and come back and potentially alter their orbits, then we'd a significant step closer to being able to save the planet should a dangerous orbit be located.

3) We don't have to go to other planets or systems to benefit from space. I imagine once ""space industry"" kicks off there will be a significant number of people that live in space. Not only is that every childs dream but given the industrialisation of space an actual reality. The reason there are not many long term space programs is because of a lack of gravity (and it's health implications), and the size of structures required to create artificial gravity are simply impractical given the current cost of transporting things in to space. But once you've industrialised space this becomes significantly easier. Need a gigantic hamster wheel to generate the centrifugal force to mimic gravity? Fine, just make one!

I don't think space programs in their current state should be stopped, they generate a lot of useful research even though it might not always be so practical. There should however be a more significant budget set aside to more practical use of space. Any country with the ability to budget such things should focus on asteroid prospecting and mining, zero-gravity forging/machining, and creating sustainable habitats for long term durations in space (5+ years).",0,1390718778,null,0,false,0,cez451k,t3_1w5qka,t1_cez451k,t1_ceyzp2e,null,1432111571,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

IMO, UK should never have banned handguns, and if thinking logically would allow them again. However, laws of that nature almost never get repealed. It is far easier to put in a bad law than it is to remove one. Especially with anything regarding public safety. Even if all the numbers were on the side of the law being useless, it is often political suicide to suggest repealing it.

We saw the same thing with getting rid of the Long Gun Registry in canada. It was objectively, by any measure a complete boondoggle. Ridiculously more expensive than projected(up around 2 billion), nearly totally redundant to our licensing system, absolutely riddled with errors and generally unreliable due to large non compliance. Couldnt be said to have had any positive effect, nor was there ever any credible way for it to have theoretically done what it achieved.

However, since it was put in as a kneejerk reaction to the 1989 polytech shooting(which it would not have stopped) it was touted to be an issue of womens safety, and preventing domestic abuse/murders.(despite the fact that a legally owned gun is no more or less dangerous to someone in the house if it is on a list somewhere)

It did eventually get repealed, but it took several significant efforts to do so, even with the widespread understanding that it was at best a pointless program.


We actually have similar issues whe discussing laws here in canada regarding guns. No one can ever objectively look at canada's laws, they always have to compare it to the USA's. Talking about repealing or changing any law, no matter how minor(even some laws that were never implemented), unless the change involves making things much stricter is viewed as ""turning canada into the USA"" and all the wastelands of dead babies that come with that image.

It would be nice if people could forget about the USA for a bit in this issue. There is a rather large continuum of laws, not just ""our country vs the USA"". For instance, if the UK were to only have the rest of europe, canada and even australia to compare to, it would be much easier to make the argument that slightly looser gun laws wouldnt result in bloodshed.

Here in canada, we would be able to say ""nearly every country in europe including the UK has no problems whatsoever with silencers(used as a safety/courtesy device widely), they shouldnt be banned here in canada for X reasons.""

Instead of that, we get ""why do you want to be american james bond assassins?""


The leaded gas thing i have heard before. It is a very compelling case for causation there, and super interesting. IIRC, plotting out countries by income inequality nearly perfectly lines up with relative murder rates. 

Whereas comparisons like gun ownership have many very big exceptions to the rule(gun laden countries and states with virtually no murder, and some gunless nations with insane murder rates) that make that a very difficult generalization to make.

Fuck the tabloids. I despise them and the English media in general for their treatment of Suarez. Yes, he has made a few mistakes but you can be sure if he was English any mistakes would be quickly forgotten. 

Did the English media talk for months and months about Defoe bite? For me much worse. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzXBSvngRR0). No, that was fine it seems.  Any English players get an easy ride no matter what they do on or off the pitch (often breaking the law).

The English media, particularly the most-read newspapers The Daily Mail and the Sun, is disgusting. Why people continue to buy this shit is beyond me. They love to knock talented or successful people down at the first chance they get. Also love to hype people up just to blow them away. Disgusting fucking cunts.


Anyway, Suarez is still a young lad and has matured a lot in recent times. You just have to watch interviews with him to see he is a genuine and humble guy who is just extremely passionate about the game.  How could anyone watch that video of him interviewed by the little Scouse kid and not see the true nature of his character. http://youtu.be/DN7RPTPdLHU 


It really fucking annoys me how he is treated, the hate against him and how this filters down into the game with the ref decisions. 


He deserves a fuckton of respect for not running away a long time ago. For facing up to the abuse and for working on his game.

Thankfully he is at Liverpool with the loyal fans behind him or he would have been gone long ago. I, for one, cherish every moment of getting to watch one of the best players in the world work his balls off for us every week. Rant over.

Firstly, I didn't like the fact that this assumed that all men are into football. The question about football players I assumed was the smallest number because it felt more market-y to highlight how prostate cancer gets less funding than football players rather than make it look like it gets more. I didn't like the stadium question either, although I can understand it being in there if you look at it in general size.

Secondly, I didn't get the point of this campaign. If it's just to 'raise awareness' I don't think it achieves it's goals. For example, it doesn't tell me whether or not I'm at risk of prostate cancer, what signs I should look for or anything useful. It's just saying largely that black men are more likely to get prostate cancer and that prostate cancer doesn't get as much funding as breast cancer.

Adding this together and I'm quite uncomfortable about handing over my details to an organisation that considers this a valid campaign.

Blair was the elected leader, not the dictator. That means his war crimes were endorsed by the Party as an organization, and we can blame them.

International rhetoric and obvious crimes against humanity were the reasons for invading Iraq, not deliberate packs of lies. At the time, the evidence supported WMDs in Iraq, however in hindsight said this information was incorrect.

Might I also remind you the Tories voted for the war, more than Labour MPs ([139 revolt] (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2862325.stm))

As a kid I actually supported Everton (my Mum is from Liverpool), whilst living in the High Peak. That was in the era of Tony Cottee breaking their club transfer records. Then I was following Stockport for a while (I was born there, what can I say?), before I realised none of it felt right. Somehow, City ""just did"".

I actually remember the moment where I started to really get into City in a big way and football - specifically City football - became a much more important part of my life. I was in my mid-20s, and it was [this game](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/3447235.stm). 

I remember watching it on BBC Choice (remember that?), and was just blown away. I'd been following more and more games, was reading many fanzines and websites, going to the odd game, but that second half was the 45 minutes when I could feel my blood turn to sky blue and calcify. :-)

Oddly, I've not been able to share in the highs as much as I would have liked. For the FA Cup win I was under a general anaesthetic having emergency surgery (I was told of our victory in the recovery room by the porter), and I even missed that last game of 2011/12 because I was in Geneva working and my boss wouldn't give me a few hours off because we had a product launch to do. I learned of that victory via Skype on the corner of my laptop screen with the one message ""KUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" from a mate.

As such, I have been with and watched more City games when we've been shit than I have when we've had the victories.

In fact, I'm in two minds about where to be for when we meet Barcelona. I want to watch it, obviously. But given for the most part when I watched we *were* shit, and when I wasn't able to we pulled off against-the-odds amazing victory (save for that game against Spurs), maybe I need to be ""busy"" somewhere.

That said, I live in London these days - so don't get to the CoMS much (I sometimes find a neutral/away ticket for games down here) - but am hoping I'll be able to see City a couple of times this year at my favourite London ground: Wembley. :-)

**TL; DR:** to many die-hards, I'm a new face, but I'm not a glory hunter. My Dad did not take me to games, I did not support City when I was a kid, I was not at Maine Road for lower league games. But Pellegrini is my 8th manager, and I got into City because of their tenacity under Joe Royle, I remember Helen 'The Bell', and some major life events are defined in my memory by what City were doing on that day. Make of that what you will, but I know that after 15 or so years of unwavering support that deep down I'm a blue.

I also needed to buy out my house mate as they were wanting to get married and frankly I would have been a terrible 3rd wheel.  So I needed this cash, fast.  It's a great situation to be in to have a successful creation of yours enable you to buy (with mortgage!) the outstanding share of a modest 2 bed flat.  I'd been saving a little bit of a rainy day fund in my company to let me expand a bit, but figured I didn't need it any more.

My accountant didn't warn me about what happened, I used an out of date assumption.  I was taxed on a significant part of my bonus dividend over 65%.

This really, really fucked things up.  As you can imagine buying a flat, even if it was just a friends share is stressful.  It doesn't matter if you are earning median or four times median wage, the costs are often proportional, if you are doing a 12 hour day, you can't really manage more than 2 hour commute (well I can't).

When you are making (in retrospect bad!) choices about work and life balance, doing 12 day weeks, telling yourself it's for a simple goal and then suddenly it's slipped just out of reach, it really fucks things up psychologically.

I'd never taken my accounting seriously before then.  I hate accounts, it's boring, needlessly complex.

After that I take everything very seriously.  I wasn't claiming certain expenses I could have been.  I very nearly went for a LBT structure, but decided that was a little too immoral.  I can really understand why someone decides that tax is too much.  Having been their myself I'm a real believer that the laffer curve is real, truth be told, the only reason I didn't go for an LBT is because I know how much my family cost the NHS.  Oh LBTs make you pay about 13-17% 'tax' I used the word tax lightly as it doesn't go the UK.  In the end I stopped working such long hours, changed what I was doing to a less demanding area.  I also make about 30% less gross revenue for my company too.  I have more time for friends and relationships, it's more balanced life overall.

**TLDR**: Used to have 'simple' approach to my company tax, claim nothing, process it all simply.  Hit a very high rate of tax on a chunk of my income, now I claim everything I can possibly and don't bother working so hard.",0,1390731313,null,0,false,0,cez6np2,t3_1w40ei,t1_cez6np2,t1_ceyihj4,null,1432112714,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

For example, here's their choice of first 11 midfielders:

Capoue
Sandro
Paulinho
Dembele
Holtby
Sigurdsson
Eriksen
Chadli
Lennon
Townsend
Lamela

Our midfielders are:

Coutihno, Gerrard, Lucas, Allen, Sterling, (Moses), Hernderson.

Do you see the difference. Apart from Townsend they have 10 full international, first team players. We have 5 (discounting Sterling's cap as I did with Townsend). Moses is on loan.

So we lose Lucas and what do we do?

They lose Sandro, they play Paulinho.

They lose Eriksen, they play Sigurdsson.

We lose Coutinoho with Lucas out, who do we play?

This si why Spurs are more equipped to finish 4th. They start playing well, which they are under Sherwood and they can close on us no problem.

A win for Everton in the derby and they're above us.

I'm not being doom and gloom it's being realistic and not thinking that a goal difference or a points per game means that's how they're going to play for the rest of the season.

It's not irrational, it's logical to suggest that the team with the best squad would be favourites. I'd put our first 11 up against anyone, it's after that that we run into problems and unless we stay injury free we'll be lucky to finish 4th.

Feeling sorry for Rodwell and Richards today: I like and rate them both, and they got the start probably with Pellegrini listening to their need for more starts with it being a World Cup year and their places in the England squad looking a little doubtful. He was doing them a favour.

But subbing them out for Kompany and Zabaleta turned the squad around so quickly, definitively and successfully, they might not get another start this season: it's clear we need to be at full strength all the time and the smallest chink can be exploited. I feel particularly bad for Micah.

It's not even their fault. They weren't terrible, it's just the team gels better when Kompany is there keeping control and Zaba is switched on.

Both the Watford goals were down to not closing them down and giving them too much unchallenged space. It was the classic problem we have of letting opposition have as much of that half of the field as they want without us making them fight for it. We were slow at the back and poor readers of their intentions in the first half. In the second half, that ship got very tight by the looks of it.

Didn't rate too highly what I saw of Demichelis (he needs more situational awareness and Pellegrini pushed him forward to get him into a part of the field where that became easier - he may be a better midfielder than defender), Pants-a-million was beaten too easily, and it would be lovely if Yaya woke up and rubbed the sleep out of his eyes before getting to the ground in future.

Ah well, we're through either way. Today we'll see who we get in the next round. I'll be happy with anybody other than Arsenal. I'd like us to avoid them until the final if we can.

2) United can still challenge for the top 4 this season and they are always seen as a title contender and next season they will still be seen as one. I don't know what counts as direct rival if United ain't one.

3) Well if that's true then it makes the case even worse.

4) NEVER? What make you think Mata would never get into the team? He is a great player and I have faith in him. Even Jose once said maybe in Feb Mata would return to his best form. I don't know why you have even less lack of faith than Jose had.

This was affirmed in another big case of Brooks v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis, where Stephen Lawrence's friend tried to sue the Metropolitan Police.


However they are held to have some accountability, in Kirkham they fucked up by not relaying to the prison service, despite having knowledge, that they are bringing a suicidal man to their custody, and they were held to have a duty because the man was arrested, in their cells etc - it was a special case. **This is also why prisons, courts etc base  mental health nurses to prevent this kind of thing from happening.**

true,FreddyDeus,yorkshire,Ayup,"Tax avoidance is merely an accounting term. It covers a broad range of issues. There are obviously very morally dubious tax avoidance schemes (schemes that operate within the letter of the law, but not the spirit of the law).

But it is, in fact, not actually possible to work for yourself or run a business without indulging in tax avoidance. It's also possible for people on PAYE to indulge in tax avoidance.

If you are on PAYE, you can put a certain amount of money annually into an ISA. This pays you tax free interest. You can buy Premium Bonds, the winnings of which are tax free. You can save money in a National Savings and Investment account, which again pays tax-free interest.

If you do the things I've mentioned above, then welcome to tax avoidance.

If you become, let's say, a self-employed gardener, you're going to need a vehicle. You are now about to do a bit of tax avoidance.

HMRC allow you to define the purpose of that vehicle in two ways. It can be classed as a business vehicle or it can be classed as a personal vehicle.

If you class it as a business vehicle, then all your running costs and maintenance become tax deductible. But when you use it for personal use, you are legally obliged to pay tax on that usage.

If you classify the vehicle as being for personal use, none of the running cost are tax deductible, but you can 'rent out' the vehicle for business use. This means you can charge your business 40 pence per mile to a certain point, then charge 20 pence per mile thereafter. The business miles you do are tax deductible.

So now, as a self-employed gardener, you have a choice. The choice that HMRC *expect* you to make, and the one your accountant will advise you to make, is the one that costs you the least amount in tax.

Because as a gardener you will be using the vehicle for business use the vast majority or the time, it will cost you less in tax to register it as a business vehicle. If you choose the option that costs you less in tax, you have just done tax-avoidance.

This isn't a loophole, or a dodgy con. This is both morally and legally legitimate. In fact these options were specifically designed to suit businesses with different needs, so that one type of business isn't gouged unfairly for tax while another business (that makes no more profit) gets to pay very little.

Like I say, tax avoidance is virtually impossible to avoid when working for yourself or running a business.",0,1390734896,null,0,1390736288,0,cez76f6,t3_1w40ei,t1_cez76f6,t1_cez6qy4,null,1432112956,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"Long and short of it and I apologise for confusion. I've re-written this three times.

When I first moved to Leicester I made a friend and we were very close. He got involved with a girl who's the epitome of gold-digger [I shall know her as X]... he friends are bitchy, arrogant, disgusting wretches.

The start of their relationship was great, but then she and the other-half started butting heads over small things and X decided to start being manipulative and damn right rude to the other-half (Such as turning her back on her when she was talking, not offering her food if she brought some over, ignoring her and contradicting her all the time) to the point where it kicked off and I told her to drop the attitude or leave.

She left, took my friend with her and slowly poisoned his mind against my friends and I. Over the next 2 years my girlfriend and I would only offer the olive branch of peace and nothing more (Tea? Food? A chat... you know the drill) as he was still in my eyes a friend deluded.

Six months ago she broke it off with him because the grass was greener and her friends turned on her and it ruined their friend group. He came back with his tail between his legs and begged forgiveness... I accepted him back and worked with my best friend to keep him on the straight and narrow the past few months. Picking him up when needed, going the pub, man-time, advice as a big brother does.

He started seeing my Little-Big sister around four months ago and they got on really well and he seemed genuinely happy to be with someone who wasn't a sociopathic fruit-cake. Then two weeks ago he fell to pieces for no reason, last tuesday he broke up with my Little-Big Sister (With no remorse, no ""I'm sorry"", not a hint of emotion towards her) and started speaking to his ex-girlfriend again (Who believe it or not... had broken up with the grass is greener fellow)

I had words with both of them and discovered he was lying to the pair of us (Giving us different stories just to keep us off his back, and I **hate** liars.), I ended up having words yesterday and told him that a friendship between Him, Myself and his ex-girlfriend is impossible and a friendship between he and I is mutually-exclusive to a relationship with her (X).

He instead decided to patronise, condemn and even insult my attitude towards him over the past few months, calling me a weak minded idiot who would do anything for my other half given the same situation... After a few bouts of insults between us he left it at ""Friends are friends because they stick together through thick and thin and you'll always be there for me.""

I never responded, he made it all official he is now back seeing X and I removed him from my life. The solidarity part comes from the fact that my friends (including a family member of his) have turned their backs on him, removed him from their lives because of the sheer level of betrayal he has shown us. They've gathered instead on helping my Little-Big Sister who needs the help at the minute and it gave me the view I needed to see I've made the right decision.

Which match do you have in mind? Unless the bus leaves after the ticket office has opened, you'll have to by the ticket beforehand. The ticket you get is allocated a seat, but it's sit anywhere, and there were plenty of free seats on my coaches.

&gt; Does the same bus service that takes you to the game also bring you back to London? Is this included in the fare?

You will indeed be getting the same bus back to London included in the price. This means that you go straight to the coach after the game though, so no opportunity to sight see in whatever post-industrial provincial idyll to which you're headed.

Nope, and it's apparently illegal and can land the (third party) coach company in hot water.

Well that just isn't true is it. There is a pretty big +/- 15% range on most of the Scottish Independence polls. Infact the Sky News commissioned polls on the same day showed the complete opposite. 

Even despite the swing, the figures still show 44% for the no vote - so the title of this post ""End of the UK draws near"" is demonstrably false, despite the swing support for the status quo still remains by far the most likely outcome. To add further to that, even if Scotland did separate from the UK, that doesn't mean and end-of-days for the UK. Hard as it is to believe, the UK isn't propped up by the 10% of people living in Scotland. Infact, historically quite the opposite. Scotland is in something of a golden age at the moment in so much as they are actually solvent - a historical accomplishment.

The reason my original post mentioned pursuing tax evasion rather than avoidance is that you can't actually pursue avoidance because it is legal, and most of the 'loopholes' that people talk of are there for perfectly reasonable and legitimate reasons. But can be and are, as in any system, abused.

Every time the public demands the closure of a tax loophole and the government grants their wish, there is a subsequent outcry about how this is terrible for many business (that now might go under and cost people jobs).

We saw this a year or two ago when people were outraged that charitable donations were tax deductible. So the chancellor changed the tax laws to limit the amount of tax relief that people and business could claim. What happened? Have a guess.

&gt; Alex Ferguson has been mercifully quiet since his retirement, contenting himself in the main with a seat in the stands from which to glare down balefully at the struggles of his hapless and helpless successor, David “Gollum” Moyes.  It’s been a quieter and more peaceful – even saner – game without the rantings of the whisky-nosed old curmudgeon.  Although Moyes’ plight has been pitiful to behold, at least some light has been shed on what was behind the success of virtually the same team last season, which looks so spectacularly inept this time around.  It’s been Fergie all the time it seems; terrifying opponents, refs and FA officials alike into granting his team every advantage they could wish for.  Now that he’s subsided into a brooding and impotent silence, away from the arena itself, the game seems a fairer and cleaner thing, with everyone a lot happier – fans all over Devon and Cornwall and in Milton Keynes who have Man U sympathies always excepted.
&gt; 
&gt; The old tyrant’s broken that silence this weekend though, deigning to pronounce upon the Premier League Title race, for which he sees a wider-than-usual field of maybe as many as six possible contenders.  Pushing the margins of credibility, he includes old charges Man U among these contenders, along with the Arsenal, Man City, Chelsea and even Everton and Spurs.  Notable by their absence from this select group of “Fergie’s Favourites” is Liverpool FC, a name that the Govan Gob studiously avoided mentioning, wary perhaps of bringing on an attack of apoplexy.  Clearly, the purple-nosed Taggart clone still has a problem with a club he vowed to “knock off their perch” when he first slithered south all those years ago.  How he failed to do that, despite all those lies, damned lies and statistics, is detailed below.
&gt; 
&gt; Let’s face it – Man U fans can crow all they want about 20 titles, but the evidence to confound their plastic claims is there for all to see, like some geological stratum separating the dinosaurs from the mammoths.  That schism dividing the game up to ’92, from the showbiz shenanigans of ’93 onwards, stands out like a Tory at a Foodbank, exposing Man U as the wealth-backed, monopolising opportunists that they are.  Seven titles in their history before Uncle Rupert bought the game for them.  Thirteen in the twenty years after the game went mad for money when, aided by more riches than anyone else, combined with the threat of Fergie to cow refs and officials, the Pride of Devon all but cleaned up in what was no more or less than a game of craps played with the dice heavily loaded in their favour.  And it was all done with such bad grace, another indictment of this new and joyless age we’ve been plodding through.  No gentle wisdom of the Bob Paisley variety – instead we had the sour bile of Ferguson himself and now seemingly a Fergie-Lite clone in the newly growly and grouchy David Moyes.  No loveable old-style hard-man Desperate Dan type like Tommy Smith – we just had the manufactured machismo of Roy Keane, a supposed tough-guy with an assumed snarl and trademark glower, whose typical party trick was to sneak up behind wee Jason McAteer and fell that not-exactly-scary individual with a sly elbow.
&gt; 
&gt; The comparisons could go on all day, but the bottom line is that Liverpool at their peak – and it was a hell of a peak – typified all the values of football that some of us remember from a pre-Sky, pre-glitz, pre-greed age when it really was all about a ball.  Now, it’s all about money, and contracts, and egos, and snide bitching to the media if you don’t get all your own way – and lo, we have the champions we deserve – but not, it seems, for very much longer – despite the wishful thinking of a silly and deluded old man.
&gt; 
&gt; To apply a conversion rate which sums up the way our game has been degraded in the Fergie/Murdoch era – let’s say that each Premier League (or Premiership, or whatever else it’s been marketed as) is worth maybe half – at the very most – of each proper Football League Championship, won on a level playing field in the days when the game still belonged to us and the world was a happier and more carefree place.  At that rate, Man U are still a good long distance behind Liverpool, which, on the basis of the history of English football as a whole, is precisely where they belong.
&gt; 
&gt; Ferguson might choose to ignore the challenge of a newly-invigorated Liverpool, but then again, football knowledge was never the strong point of the Demented One.  For bullying and intimidation, he wouldn’t have had much to learn from Torquemada, but his opinions on the game can safely be set aside in favour of those from saner minds – i.e. just about anyone else.  Meanwhile, it should be emphasised once and for all, for the avoidance of doubt and despite the latest nonsense from S’ralex – Liverpool are still very much The Greatest.",0,1390741446,null,0,false,0,cez837u,t3_1w6rqv,t1_cez837u,t3_1w6rqv,null,1432113366,17,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,17

true,EpicFishFingers,eng-Suffolk,Suffolk County,"For the FAC you need an even better reason. The onyl reason they'll give you one over a shotgun license is if you have needs that a shotgun can't fulfill, such as being part of a target practice club. Criminal convictions of any kind can debar you from such a license (sometimes permanently), you need two referees, and the police can simply say ""no"" at any point if they decide it's not right to give you a gun for whatever reason.

Given the strictness of gun regulations in the UK I reckon even the smallest non-vehicle misdemeanor would be enough for the police to say no, such as shoplifting, and especially for burglary, assault, or a mugging.

I honestly think one of the main thigns that keeps people from trying to get guns is the large-scale faff involved. You have to prove you don't want it for self-defence, so if you actually do want the guns for that purpose, you'll have a hard time getting them. If a criminal acquired a gun and shot someone, you know the police would go to his door first as they would look for the few people who they knew owned guns. If everyone had guns they'd have a lot harder time finding out who shot soeone if there was a shooting, especially if the gun had fallen 'off the grid' which could become more likely to happen where loopholes open up when more and more people own guns.

I must admit though, for a while I've considered the idea of having a gun just to say i have one. but if that's the reason for owning a deadly weapon then there's no point, in my eyes. If someone less stable than me knew I had guns, they could just nick one one day, and as such I'm providing someone else with an easy method to cause harm. Yes the gun cases are to be kept locked and the spare keys are to be hidden but what if they find the keys? I know they're meant to be strong so I checked BS 7558 (the one governing gun cabinets). The foreword states: ""In the development of this British Standard it was demonstrated that the specification only of the design and construction features of a gun cabnet was insufficient to provide adequate resistance to sustained forcible attack; cabinets made to the most stringent existing design and construction requirements still provided points of weakness which could be breached in less than 1 minute by the methods of physical attack described in this standard"" (I had to manuallty type that as adobe reader is shit and won't let me highlight, copy or paste text even if it isn't a scanned document)

1 minute of attacking somsone's gun cabinet while they're out seems like a lot less effort than obtaining a FAC, hence why I'm generally against guns anyway. You have to regulate them so carefully to make sure that they're not misused, that you might as well just not bother with them, and in my eyes any risk of people misusing the weapons is completely unacceptable.

Also as a general counter to the stats about murders after the 1997 change (which only really added that you had to have 2 referees and to buy guns over the counter, as well as banning pistols), seeing as it was never easy for people to access guns in the first place, murderers used knives because it's less easy to track them. But what would allowing more guns do to change that stat? Any drop off in knife crime would be made up for by increase in gun crime. With more guns available, some will surely slip off the grid for criminal use, serial numbers scraped off, gun repurposed or destroyed after use etc.

Sorry, my counter: some stats for [homicide in Australia](http://guncontrol.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/1995-2006-1.png) after various gun controls, and also for [suicide in Australia](http://guncontrol.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/1995-2006-2.png) after the same controls, taken from [here](https://theconversation.com/faking-waves-how-the-nra-and-pro-gun-americans-abuse-australian-crime-stats-11678), which also mentions the massacres that plague the US as a result of its gun culture.

Also for the old adage ""don't bring a knife to a gun fight"": well, the knife might win [if you're within 21 feet and haven't drawn your gun](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fPNhWH_Thk) (no danger present so no need to do so)

Also on the subject of silencers: [They don't work as well as films portray them to](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5MrC68udj8). I guess that's a point for you as it makes guns less stealthy, but it also shows that current legislation isn't as much favoured towards people wanting to carry out a shooting with legal weapons and get away with it.

I'm sorry but I really don't think my mind can be changed on this. So many times I hear stories from the US of someone who took their dad's gun into school and offed several students, rather than the stories of how the gun saved the day, and this is on reddit who as a whole is pretty liberal and a bit of a freedom-jerk at times (someone once tried to convince me that censoring racist comments and hate crimes on a private online forum is bad because any kind of censorship is bad), so you'd think they would support guns as an inherent freedom for citizens to indulge in. This is with regular checks to /r/justiceporn in tow, and yes I know there are points I could be missing but reddit jumps on all news stories so I thought I'd hear of the 'good' that guns do too.

Although it's good to have a reasoned debate with someone on the topic of guns. On any other subreddit if I mention my disagreement with the widespread application of guns, I get shouted down and downvoted by the americans who seem to genuinely take offence to the idea of someone questioning their second-amendment right (as though the US in the onyl coutnry in the world or something)

Hell, maybe gund can improve a situation but I honestly think it's luck of the draw whether guns will do more good or bqad, as there seems to be (admittedly) stats for both the pro and anti gun argument ([for example, this source claims worse crime rates after gun ban in Australia](http://www.worldpublicunion.org/2013-04-05-NEWS-australian-gun-ban-resulted-in-higher-crime-rates.html)).

In my mind that only presents two ways it could go, and I just don't think this country should risk the bad side of guns to appease the (in my mind) few instances where a person being attacked wished they had a gun to fend off their attackers (who in their mind would not then also have a gun)

Admittedly my one exception to this is the police. I believe more officers should be armed, however all officers who are armed should carry a camera. The cameras would maintain a oermament upload to secure servers so officers couldn't turn off their cameras to abuse their powers. It's not outside of the realm of our technology to do such a thing, we have BT open zone wifi hotspots pretty much everywhere now, and the terabytes of collected data could be wiped each day or two if nothing comes up. The cameras would prevent the police abusing their powers also (another thing that reddit tells me is a *constant* plague on society and blah blah etc.)

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"Actually what would happen is you'd get some average if improvable players giving up because they thought they could never win. For Kids this is a big problem because they grow at different rates and develop physically at different times. 

What would happen is that the teams with the biggest and strongest players at the time would win. Players that had other skills, such as passing the ball or game awareness/vision wouldn't have a chance to practice it simply because they were overpowered if they weren't man-mountains at the age of 12. 

It also stopped you trying out different positions and skill sets because if you didn't have the right body shape at the time you ended up somewhere were you just didn't operate very well. 

So kids would just hate it. I hated rugby when I started playing. Then I grew, then I loved it because I understood it better by watching it on TV and playing better. However, I'd get lumped into areas where I was less useful with my natural skills because of body shape eg I could pass the ball better than most of my team and control the game but because I was big and strong I ended up in the forwards which was boring and didn't suit me thus I went off the game all together. 

At uni it got better because I had fully grown and wasn't that big/strong compared to average so I could slot in everywhere, but it was too late to make anything of myself in the game and real life intervened.

If you see a flat too good to be true on gumtree, it may be a scam. Will be even more obvious when you get an immediate reply saying to give them money. Never pay a finders fee to a letting agency for a property it's illegal in Scotland but some very shady companies try it on. A box room is a room without windows but some are actually alright and they usually mean significantly cheaper rent. Tenants have to pay council tax (rates) here so keep that in mind for prices. Try to avoid Niddrie and Sighthill, no offence to people that live there but you can do without the hassle. Buses are a flat fare 1.50 for most of the city (and outskirts) and are pretty much always on time (unlike in Aucks). If you can go private landlord do. Letting agents are a pain in the ass.

Because you'll have no history here often you'll have to pay a deposit if you're getting a new mobile contract (unless you go pay as you go), the money goes on as a credit on your account at the end of the 3 months. Banks will be a bit weary of you trying to open a regular account but many have an account for new arrivals (which is a bit shit, has no overdraft and costs you 10quid a month... this is for HSBC though so mileage may vary). Banks also run on a contract basis so you lock yourself in for 18 months (i found this extremely odd). Oh and your NZ drivers license is not always accepted as ID for mobile companies, banks etc.. so if you know you need ID bring your passport (not always the case but i've had hassles).

Be prepared to see a lot more vomit on the streets (i see some every single day). BUT the upside is be prepared for FAR cheaper booze and lots of fantastic bars, gigs (especially in Glasgow!) and lovely people.

Your average police officer knows little more than your average person when it comes to mental health issues. They just have a lot more experience than most other people. My mental health training was little more than a couple hours of quizzes on a computer screen.

The polices role when it comes to mental health is really just about making a risk assessment on how much of a risk a person poses to themselves or others and then arresting if necessary to ensure someone gets the help they need. 

One example I can think of is a person who took several paracetamol tablets to try to kill themselves.

We upgrade the Keeper spot with Mignolet, both now and for the foreseeable future.

Sakho is already a good starting CB who wrestled Aggers starting spot, and should be one of the leagues better CB for the future.

Toure has been quite a good 3rd choice CB for free.

For RB and LB take your pick. I think Cissokho has playing alright recently, and I don't see Rodgers taking him off the first team.

Gerrard can't be all alone in DM, he'll be needing some help, that's why I put Hendo there. 

However I don't know if they'll be able link up with the offense, that's why I put Coutinho, who I believe has not been that great recently, hopefully that will change since I can't think of anyone else to put there instead except for Alberto who's having difficulties breaking into the first team.

When I found out that Allen was injured, I was less than excited for this derby, fortunately for us, Everton have the same amount of players as we do, that's 7 players.

What the hell are they feeding them over there at the Merseyside?

I sincerely hope that Sakho will be ready for the Derby, since Skrtel and Toure have been less than great in our defence, according to Physioroom, Sakho is set for return on the 28th, but I wouldn't get my hopes up.

Teachers are just a few years older than their pupils in some cases, some classrooms have 8 languages to deal with - inner city heads trumpet the success of multiculturism with a fat pay packet.

If you thought things were being dumbed down before, see how it works when you are having to dumb things down across multiple cultures and languages too. Have they done a good job? I don't think so, many pupils are disinterested and distracted.

Is it OFSTEDs fault? Yes, it is - because they sat on their laurels and did nothing to improve teaching, even they know it is a losing battle and guys like this have taken the cash for themselves. If it isn't 'required' now, it will be in the next 10 years for English parents to have their children in private schooling, i bet these peoples kids don't have to worry about shite education.

&gt; but to suggest he could get into Brazil's team is madness.

I don't think so, no. If you look at the current Brazil squad you have Júlio, Victor, Jefferson, Alves, Vidotto and Cavalieri listed as GKs. Now, I don't watch Brazillian football, so I don't really know how good Victor, Jefferson, Vidotto and Cavalieri are.. Alves is in Valencia and from what I gather hasn't really played a lot... Júlio (77 caps) is the most capped and prolific keeper of the bunch and he hasn't had more than 1 appearance since May for QPR. Gomes is actually currently the second most capped keeper with 11 caps. He played alright up until he broke his hand in Hoffenheim and I think he HAS A CHANCE to be included in the squad for the WC in a position that is pretty scarce on top flight quality. 

Right now Júlio is playing on merit, and I don't know how Scolari usually picks his squad.. But if Gomes finds his best form, I don't see why he wouldn't get a call up?

Mata plays VERY well off the right hand side, he did it lots for Chelsea.
 If you look at a front four (left to right) Januzaj, Rooney, RVP and Mata you start to form a picture. Moyes even stated that Mata was the first of ""many big signings to come"" or something similar in the press conference he held yesterday. 

Maybe they'll get a LB and CM before the window shuts? He has been in Italy and Germany the past week to scout/watch players for both the Juve and München games. 

I think the Mata signing is the start of ""the big revival"" at United to be totally honest. It's a big moral boost to the players, and a big statement to both fans and rivals splashing out £37m on a record signing. Rooney is even rumored to be signing a new contract...

Even though Ukip has disassociated itself from that opinion, the very fact that it had to do so suggests it's a party that homophobes are drawn to.

&gt;'far-right' as a shorthand for euroskeptic, free-market, anti-immigration.




Okay, he's clearly predominantly free-market, no controversy or contention there.

--------------------

Eurosceptic being synonymous for right wing...now that's an oddity.  In other countries it is just as likely to be the other way around.  In this country it used to be the other way around.  Old Labour used to be the Eurosceptics, and if you go to the Conservative leaning EUsceptical Bruges Group where under MPWatch they rank MPs according to their Eurosceptical credentials it is the Old Labour guard that rank amongst the very highest.  No2EU was a leftwing unionist campaign backed by UK Communists (presumably all 12 of them).

I know it's not just you, it's a national thing, but at the Carnival of British Politics euroscepticism being linked to far-right the way it is is the equivalent of the freak show meets the hall of mirrors.  Everything is in the wrong place, the wrong way around, and warped in strange ways.  

Again, corporates and big business gain the most out of the EU: that EUscepticism is attributed to the far right is a coup on their behalf.  They can push for corporatocracy and the break up of socialised national jewels and then hold their hands up with the defence 'But we're pro EU'.

-----------------------------------

'Anti-immigration'

I'm surprised Nigel doesn't do a little jig and dance every time this comes up just to keep it fresh.  He gets it from all sides, at all times, the same allegation, and he just repeats the same mantra.

Not anti-immigration, pro-controlled immigration.  

And pro-controlled net immigration at that.  [**Andrew-soon-to-be-kicked-out-of-his-MEP-offices-and-his-salary-ripped-out-of-his-chest-pocket-fucking-Brons**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO22-FW5Qdc) even mentioned in the European Parliament on a blue card question that Farage, when on the Daily Politics show, willingly offered up that if UK industry had a need for workers which the UK for whatever reason couldn't meet then they'd go headhunting.  Another 50 000, or another 100 000, or even 200 000 more work visas?  Fine.  If we need it, bring it in.  He says the same thing about wanting *controlled* immigration time and time again.  He must do it in his sleep.  Every time it crops up elsewhere it's always transmuted somehow into anti-immigration.

That's not anti-immigration.  That's controlled immigration to protect the domicile working classes.

If you subscribe to the strict economic definition, the far-right is actually far-'left' economically.

In particular supporting ""petit-bougoise"" small businesses against big capital (at least in rhetoric) is a classic trait of fascist and nationalist movements.

true,JosephFurguson,null,null,"It did not imply another regeneration. The ~~Fan Fiction~~ Doctor Who Prose novels, the Big Finish Audiobooks and some comic books simply has the 8th Doctor joining the Time War in an unofficial capacity. He did not fight alongside the other Time Lords, but did a lot of the espionage and sabotage stuff. He also went against the Orders of the Time Lord, who dubbed him Renegade instead of Mad Fool. He simply did not refer to himself as Doctor in the fiction. 

The prose also has the 8th Doctor creating the Moment from a Dematerialization gun and using it to prevent Rassilon's scheme from working in the Time War. 

Why the 8th Doctor? Well he was pretty much a blank slate at the time. Sure the Big Finish Audio books fleshed out the 8th Doctor, but so did the prose fiction and the comics. Each one was vastly different from the others. So it was possible to have the 8th be the one to do it. 

The fans, being fans, responded to a list of disparaging facts by making them fit together, even if the pieces do not exactly match up. What little was known about the 9th Doctor pointed to him being incapable of genocide. He allows people to die, aid it along in some cases, but he does not outright kill entire cultures. So, they pinned the burden of genocide onto the 8th Doctor, about whom less is known. 

The fans were so busy forcing the 8th doctor into committing genocide that it did not occur to them to create a Doctor capable of doing the act. ",0,1390752008,null,0,false,0,cezahv8,t3_1w18dw,t1_cezahv8,t1_ceymddh,null,1432114627,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

If you've used your £5760 allowance for your cash ISA then you've still got £5760 to use for the S&amp;S ISA. You have £11520 of ISA allowance, up to £5760 can be used for a cash ISA and whatever is left can be used for your S&amp;S ISA.

&gt; I'm curious about the stocks and shares ISA. How safe are they?

Only as safe as the investments inside them, if you invest in risky stocks then they're not safe at all. Investing in index funds can be much safer, as they track the market as a whole (which, despite drops and crashes, has pretty much always risen over long timescales).

&gt; Is there a benefit to them if I am already not using any of my capital gains tax allowance?

When you sell, yes, as hopefully you will exceed that allowance. There's no reason you'd want to invest outside of an ISA while you still have allowance inside one (except when you want to invest a lot more and you only want to pay for one trade, but even then).",0,1390752180,null,0,false,0,cezajt4,t3_1w72hf,t1_cezajt4,t1_ceza9fo,null,1432114657,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"The number of howlers he had were a lot more than you think, especially as some of them we'rent punished. He made a lot more than a couple of mistakes, he'd make a couple a game if you consider how badly he dealt with corners.
Just because he's nice or w/e shouldn't cover up the fact he was bad for us.

We kept giving him chances to get a run of consistency without errors but they just kept coming back in. It is too dangerous to have a keeper that erratic in front of your back 4, they end up not trusting their keeper because they don't know what he'll do.

In fact I was keen to keep giving him a chance to stop making mistakes, but it never happened and it got to the point where you knew he'd never turn it round here and just needed a fresh start in a different league. But cause of his high wages and reputation for errors we have obviously found it hard to find a suitor, especially with Levy probably hoping to recoup some of his losses.

Some GPs are quick to prescribe antidepressants without offering any kind of talking therapy, and they don't tend to be very effective if you just take them without any other kind of support, so if you want counselling, make sure you say that to your GP.

If you're nervous about talking to your GP or you think they might be awkward or unhelpful (some can be, unfortunately) you can ask your GP practise if there is a doctor or nurse who specialises in mental health, and they will definitely be helpful and understanding.

You can see a counsellor through the charity Mind without going through your GP, but you generally have to be unemployed or on a low income. There are other local charities which offer counselling, usually for people on a low income or based on a ""pay what you can afford"" sliding scale.

Bear in mind that NHS waiting lists are extremely long (months, sometimes even longer), and waiting lists for charities can also be very long. If you feel that you are suicidal or in immediate danger to yourself or anyone else, please tell your GP and you will get an urgent referral and won't have to wait.

I agree with the priority of a central/defensive midfielder, but a (left?).sided attacker who could score goals would be a huge plus, as the squad is over reliant on Suarez and sturridge to score from open play.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"&gt;Virtually all their policies are right wing.

Apart from all the ones I just mentioned, right?

&gt;**For expanded police force**

#1

Not of itself a right-wing policy.  

And not necessarily authoritarian either if that's what you're getting confused with.  I know it's popular amongst some more angsty fringe-protest to think the police are against the common man, but in reality the front line police are the common man.  And the vast, vast, vast majority of them do a very good job.  

I know that if there was a missing child, or if there'd been an accident, or I came across a victim of a crime, I'd have no doubt who to call.  Police=bad, let alone Police=rightwing is just silly.

Visible frontline servicing makes people FEEL safer.  Whether the figures show that that is the most efficient means of attributing services, or if people have a warped perception of how bad crime is, if people are *feeling* less safe then that in itself is real enough.

0/1

-------------------------

&gt;**For increased prison population**

#2

Again, not of itself a right wing policy.  More over it is not a UKIP policy either - the party that wants a referendum on drugs.  

What they have argued for is giving greater autonomy and flexibility to judges when it comes to sentencing, and argued ways to reduce recidivism.  They have argued we need to build new prisons.  Given then we're still using Victorian prisons they kinda have a point even if you don't want to agree with it.

Again:  Not Right Wing policy of itself, and not UKIP policy either.

0/2

-----------------------

&gt;**For a larger military**

#3

Not right wing policy.  Plenty of more left wing countries have considerable militaries.  

UKIP does argue to extend military spending back to mid 90s levels so it can be more independent in its foreign policy and not beholden to other militaries to fill operational gaps.  They argue this is needed so they never have to feel obliged to get involved in things like Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria or any other project neo-conservatives might think of.

Y'up.  I went there.  I flipped it around.  A self-dependent UK military  with mid 1990s spending levels means being able to say nope to neo-Conservative wars for corporate convenience.

Bigger military in this sense means LESS right wing.

-1/3

------------------------------------

&gt;**For a flat tax rate that gives tax cut to the rich**

#4

The really rich don't pay income tax, they pay accountants instead.

Flat rate tax?  Not so much a certain policy at the moment, there's talks that there might be an upper tax but beyond what the vast majority earns.  

As it is, that flat rate tax incorporates National Insurance too, and National Insurance drops off (as in REDUCES in rate) once you've contributed so much.  That wouldn't happen with a 'flat tax', which combined with increased personal allowance to £13k would have meant that your 'tax cut to the rich' actually means everybody working below the national average wage being better off.  

Nil score draw, doesn't count

-1/3

-----------------------------

&gt;**For a smaller welfare state**

#5

You got one!  It is fair to say that they are for a smaller welfare state.

Although they also want to devolve powers to county levels or their equivalent and to give them fiscal powers, so if you want more local services vote in some socialist councillors and raise your own local services and revenue.  

They want *central* government to spend less, they want to allow local government to raise more for local services - that's an important distinction so you're only getting a half point.  Tough, I know, but a taskmaster is ultimately a lovingmaster.

-0.5/4

--------------------------

&gt;**For giving fewer benefits to children and grandchildren of immigrants**

#6

They want to give no benefits to people that aren't entitled to benefits, they argue that by only paying benefits to people that are in need and qualify will there be a future for the welfare state.  They are absolutely not opposed to immigrants not working claiming benefits in their original country.  

They argue that once somebody qualifies for benefits, and needs benefits, then they should receive full benefits and be treated exactly the same.

Of itself not a right-wing argument.  That and what you just described, the way you've described it, isn't a UKIP policy.

-0.5/5

---------------------------

&gt;**Cuts to health and safety regulation**

#7

If I could only get my hands around the throat of that Elf of Safety.  Obviously that of itself doesn't imply far-right wing either.  If you have decades of excessive rules and regulations piled on top of one another you don't suddenly scream over to the far right if you proffer maybe rolling some of it back.

I am going to give you a point however simply because I want you to end in positive figures.

You scored 0.5/6....you can do so much better than this.

--------------------------

&gt;**Decreased workers rights, increased working hours and more pollution.**

true,nberms,lfc12,,"Great analysis, this sub needs more thoughtful and well-researched posts instead of knee-jerk reactions.

I totally see all your points and I agree - how Gerrard at the pivot would mean he has to move less as we press, so having the quicker Hendo + Lucas/Allen/Coutinho at the box to box would allow us to press better.  I also think that it would allow him to build the game from the back well and create attacks with his passing range like we all know he can.

However, there are a few problems with Gerrard at the single pivot. First, to be frank, he is a liability defensively. He has a great slide tackle, but at this point in his career he is very easily dribbled by. Against Bournemouth our midfield was often bypassed with Gerrard always being the man beaten. If he improves his positional sense then perhaps he could improve in this area. I just don't see him able to solidly protect the back four against quality opponents that we are competing near the top of the league with.

The second problem is that the offensive benefits of playing him there can be taken away from us pretty easily. Against ~~Stoke~~ edit: Villa, he was essentially man-marked, and never had any time on the ball to distribute. Because of this, we couldn't build from the back in the first half, and there were numerous turnovers, 2 of which lead to a goal. Bournemouth on the other hand didn't have the capability of effectively pressing us, and so Stevie had all the time in the world to pick out passes. Again, against top teams I just don't see it being able to work.

A third issue is that Lucas is not suited to play box-to-box for us. I love Lucas and I think he does a phenomenal job for us at DM, where his passing responsibilities are simply to keep possession and put others in the positions to excel. While he would be a fantastic part of our press, he isn't creative enough to play in the final third. If this plan were to be successful I don't see Lucas as a part of it. It will also be tough to play a 4-3-3 with SAS, as they prefer to be a strike partnership.

I do trust that BR is doing what he thinks is best for the team, and I will support whatever decisions he makes. I also recognize it's early on in this experiment, and there will be a learning curve. Plus, we are going through a ton of injuries. It has the potential to work, and we could make it happen.",0,1390757052,null,0,1390772921,0,cezc8yl,t3_1w7ab2,t1_cezc8yl,t3_1w7ab2,null,1432115481,70,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,70

I saw a BBC article desciribing him as having an ""eye for a goal"" earlier. I mean I know he's a winger, but is 9 goals in ~50 games in the Swiss Challenge League really good enough to be considered having an ""eye for a goal"" when you're signing for a top-4 challenging Premier League team? Additionally, most his 17 goals for Egypt have come against the likes of Zimbabwe and Swaziland. While he does seem to have a good record against English teams in Europe, even his European stats are a bit misleading. I mean two of his five Champions League goals this season came against Ludogorets Razgrad, a team even Philipp fucking Degen managed to score against!

The new TV  money hasn't been paid yet and may not make it into FY 2013-2014.

The wage bill may have been reduced, but ~50% of the overall wage bill is not spent on first team players, so a 20% reduction (which I doubt we've done that much honestly) is still only 10% overall.

FSG have also never really 'spent', they've instead added expenditures as debt to the club to be repaid.

Interestingly however, that substantial movement has failed, in over 50 years, to cobble together even a token women's party that stands for election to parliament.

Yet feminism has been remarkably influential while having little elected presence in parliament. How can that be?

The answer is that the women's movement, or feminists, do not need to be elected to have substantial political influence. In fact it would probably be disadvantageous for them to expose their politics and ideological beliefs to electoral scrutiny.

What I mean is, feminists don't need to be voted into the tent when they can elect themselves to stand outside it, pissing in.

Now you might criticise me here for picking on one particular area of politics (feminism).

He's playing into the old rhetoric that we are currently in a crime epidemic ( which we are not) in order to scare voters into accepting a tougher approach on crime. I would rather actually be safer due to effective policing measures than think I'm safer due to a load of Policemen driving about aimlessly. We are actually very safe in general but the media pretends we are not.

The other political parties are trying to use more schemes to reduce the prison population through alternative justice measures, but slowly so the media don't tear them apart. Again the old 'I'm gonna be the guy who's tough on crime! Vote for me and I'll keep you safe!' right wing rhetoric. We don't actually want to lock people up for low level crimes.

And a larger military is just dumb because we have the 5th biggest in the world. Again, right wing rhetoric trying to appeal to 'Our Britishness' and implying that we are in immediate danger and need to defend ourselves. Nothing but Shit-Stirring.

It also relies on those voting to be up to speed on what they are voting about.

In an age where companies claim that they're ""suffering"" because they ONLY made a hundred million in profit this year, what fucking dinklebert decides that asking for a little more tax from the one series of organisations most capable of paying for it is in any way ""anti-"" anything?

I propose a new practice. Whenever a company is found to actively postulate such positions while being comfortably profitable (say, making more than ten million a year profit) or actively foregoes tax entirely via offshore havens, loopholes or any other method, they are required to add a symbol to every single one of their logos in the country. Stores, employee uniforms, advertisements, everything. The logo will be a union jack with a red circle with a line through it, think the Ghostbusters logo.

That logo will simply tell people ""We're not going to play fair, so here's our punishment""

Maybe people will continue to shop with them. Maybe they won't. However, maybe then they'll see what it is to be truly anti-business.

Honest, tax-paying companies will probably see boosts in revenue because of decreased competition, smaller companies can get a kickback because they're in no way related to the massive grinning bastards that perpetrate this kind of possum piss, and the country as a whole benefits because, hey, if you're anti-UK, then why the fuck should we buy from you?",1,1390759486,null,0,false,0,cezd7xo,t3_1w71vg,t1_cezd7xo,t3_1w71vg,null,1432116019,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

Henderson can continue to make runs in behind and generally be all over the place and Allen can focus on recycling possession and being an outlet for Gerrard.  If Coutinho's playing on the wing he can drift in to help further pack the midfield.  The only problem with Coutinho doing this so often is that he struggles to mark the other teams RB.

That being said I still like the idea of playing Suarez and Sturridge up front in a Man City esque 4-4-2/4-2-2-2.  City have been using this to crush smaller teams with their superior forwards.  They then seem to switch to a 4-2-3-1 with Navas on the wing against stronger opponents and an extra central midfielder.

Now, I'm not saying that such a party would win, but they could at least put their fucking money where their mouth is and try. Even a lone journalist managed to oust Neil Hamilton at a general election. And if the firebrand Galloway can continue to find a parliamentary seat, then surely it isn't too much to suggest that even those professional women's rights advocates have something to answer for in never, in over half a century, attempting this.

But like I said, they don't need to. They have other methods.

As for women being elected as members of other parties. We can strip away some of the bullshit and lay the truth bare.

First, women themselves are less inclined to vote for women than for men.

Second, to get to parliament generally takes years of time, effort, dedication, networking, and putting up with many failures before finding success. The politically unacceptable truth is that women are far less inclined to spend the same time and effort doing so.

12th - Everton v Palace         
12th - Stoke v Swans

Much easier game leading up for us. Whilst we won't be able to rest many players, we will be able to maybe take some lads off after 60, which is very unlikely for Swansea. This is where things get interesting though.

Cup tie 15th - Swansea vs Everton

EUROPA LEAGUE TIE - 20th Feb - Swansea vs Napoli

22nd - Chelsea v Everton          
23rd - Liverpool v Swansea

Both very tough games, but you would imagine both teams will want a full strength side. With the potential for a relegation battle for Swansea you can think there is absolutely zero chance they will play a strong side in both the Cup and in the Tin Europe. Whilst even Swansea B won't be a walkover, this is very, very opportune for us. 

---

Interestingly Chelsea are going to have insane fixture congestion:

29th Jan - Chelsea v WHU           
3rd Feb - Citeh v Chelsea
8th - Chelsea v Newcastle      
12th - WBA v Chelsea         
15th - Citeh v Chelsea      
22nd - Chelsea v Us          
26th - Galatasaray v Chelsea

Mental month of tough games. I know they piss depth, but it does gives us some real hope going into that tie. ",0,1390760416,null,0,false,0,cezdlt9,t3_1w7dwm,t1_cezdlt9,t1_cezcn1s,null,1432116228,7,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,7

true,smaclver,null,null,"I did say in the post that I was trying to explain Rodgers thinking rather than my own opinion. But I disagree on some of your points here so let me respond.

&gt;at this point in his career he is very easily dribbled by

According to whoscored.com Gerrard gets dribbled 0.7 times per game which is less than Mikel, Phil Jones, Carrick, Lampard, Barry, Lucas, Yaya Toure, Ramsey, Mikel Arteta, Ramires and Fernandinho, all of whom haved played in front of the back four this season for top 7 teams. 

I agree that positional sense has always been a weakness, and I think both he and Brendan Rodgers know this. But game intelligence gets better with age and he like any player he needs to be protected by the players in front of him. The time to judge him in this role, for me, is when he has got 5 or 6 games under his belt in this position and has Allen/Henderson ahead of him. It's worth remembering that Lucas hasn't ""got back to his best"" this season and whilst people question his fitness, you also have to look at the amount of space he's asked to cover by the players ahead of him. Carra made exactly this point about Steven on MNF after the Villa game.

&gt;Against Stoke, he was essentially man-marked, and never had any time on the ball to distribute. Because of this, we couldn't build from the back in the first half, and there were numerous turnovers, 2 of which lead to a goal. 

I disagree here, I thought he played himself out of trouble really well throughout the game vs. Stoke in a way that Lucas couldn't. Our 1st and 4th goals were started by Gerrard passes. And if Steven Gerrard can't play his way out in this position then there's no way Lucas can.

&gt;A third issue is that Lucas is not suited to play box-to-box for us.

I completely agree, and I suspect Rodgers does too. I think he only played Lucas there for the Stoke game because Allen's injury problem has taken longer than expected to go away, I think therefore it might be a few weeks before we see a return to 4-3-3, but the systems we do use have similar patterns of play which will help Gerrard learn the position whether we're playing 4-4-2, 4-2-3-1, 3-5-2 or whatever.

I'm glad to have debates like these on here though. Far more interesting than moaning about Salah.

Gerrard is not a natural holder, he is not defensively sound, as Lucas who can with a standing tackle bring more stability to the team than a rushed last-ditch tackle can. That alone is less energy spent, by the holder and by the players surrounding that rush to aid.

 I agree with the power of distribution, but the tactics are just not there from him. He needs to understand that if he lacks in defense, then he cannot venture forward and leave space behind until the 2 CM's are a more aggressive pair than Henderson/Allen/Coutinho. I hate to make comparisons of the Captain here, but if we look at Xavi, he is slicker on the ball and can dodge an opponent better. Also, Xavi when deployed as CDM (which is unusual) tends to have physically stronger players around him. Now another comparison can be Pirlo who again has more physical players surrounding him and still has the mind to keep behind and guard his central defenders. Also, Pirlo is a player who is seeing less playing time because of age, even with his amazing talent.

I hate to be a realist here, but Gerrard, as well as the fans need to get used to seeing him in a supporting role. Unless there is enough budget to get the Vidals, Marchisios, Ramires', Busquets' and so on to play next to him.

true,UncleIroh626,mcgann,McGann,"""Random character""

The problem with your argument is that Steven Moffat wrote the Curator as a Tom Baker cameo. The point of the scene isn't ""mysterious man drops vague hints"", it's ""Tom Baker makes an appearance in the Fiftieth Anniversary Special of Doctor Who"". 

""To have the longest-standing [and the] oldest Doctor from longest ago make an appearance and be the one who briefs the new Doctor on where to go… well, it's irresistible, isn't it? You get to hear that voice again! It was just wonderful."" - Steven Moffat [\(DS interview\)](http://www.digitalspy.com/british-tv/s7/doctor-who/news/a533678/tom-baker-doctor-who-50th-cameo-was-irresistible-says-steven-moffat.html)

It's a celebratory scene, the whole point is that the iconic Tom Baker meets The Doctor as he is now. It only works with Tom Baker.

Please reconsider your other points, because they don't make any sense. Colin Baker and Peter Capaldi were brought back not because of their past roles, but because actors can play multiple characters. Tom Baker was brought back *because* he had played a past role, that being the Doctor. Telling yourself otherwise is going against the dialogue, Moffat's statements, and common sense.

If you want to have a sport where you shoot, fine. The club owns the guns, and keeps them in a suitably fortified armoury, with alarm systems linked to the Police. People can check guns out of there, and check them back in when they're done. I still don't see the need to have a pistol, but this ruleset would apply there too.

In my mind, people personally owning guns increases the likelyhood that they're going to be used for something other than target shooting. Be it self-defense, or robbery/assault, legally owned or otherwise. And with this increasing likelyhood comes with it a requirement for people breaking the law to arm themselves, and in turn the Police, and in turn the rest of us who don't want a gun, but start to feel that it's necessary ""to be safe"".

This isn't a nanny state issue, guns are designed with a single purpose; killing people, quickly, with minimal training and danger to the aggressor. Any other uses are incidental, or came after that initial design.

Half those you mentioned aren't actually policies since they revoked their 2010 manifesto.

- For scrapping tuition fees: Not a policy at the moment (even if it was, it would only be a left wing policy if they wanted to replace it with government funding, which there is no evidence of). The only way to fund it, of course, is due to the fact they want to drastically cut the number of students going to university (which is definitely not a left wing policy).    
- Introducing student grants: But getting rid of student loans.  We've been here before and it resulted in only the rich being able to afford university.    
- Investing in grammar schools for the poor but academically gifted: This isn't close to being a left wing policy.  More or less the first thing that Labour did was abolish grammar schools. Grammar schools are notorious for causing an elite system that richer parents push their children into   
- A referendum on drugs: no evidence this is even a policy, more an offhand comment made by Farage in one of his many interviews
- Direct democracy: The only evidence of referendums is on the EU.  Not that direct democracy is necessarily a left wing policy.
- Against privatisation of the NHS: But they want to peg the funding to what we currently doing, so with an ageing population will result in a poorer service.     
- Was against privatisation of the Royal Mail.  I'll give you this one (even if it appears to be a Tory policy rather than a right wing one)
- For Glass-Steagall bank regulation.  I'll give you that one, because I know very little about it.
- Against cuts to Legal Aid: Apart from an offhand comment, there doesn't seem to be much to back this up.  But for the purposes of marking, I'll let you have it.
- Against defacto media censorship under Leveson: Against regulation against media, rather than censorship.  I don't believe this is a left wing policy (if I remember correctly, both Clegg and Miliband wanted greater oversight, whereas Cameron didn't).
- Pits himself against corporations but for SMEs: I won't reiterate my distain for this, as you've already seen it.  His 'for SMEs' is actually just against workers rights.
- Devolving power away from central government: But bringing more of it back to central government from the EU, let's not forget.

I'll give you 3/10 of the left wing policies.  Not that we really know what their policies are, given how often they give up on policies and just argue for populist things.",1,1390762187,null,0,false,0,cezecfm,t3_1w6vag,t1_cezecfm,t1_cezbvxs,null,1432116590,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,nberms,lfc12,,"Some great points. I think Gerrard's number is low because he hasn't been playing at the pivot for most of the year, and so isn't having to defend against the dribble as often. I'm mostly basing this off of what I saw vs. Villa and Bournemouth.

Also, I mistakenly said Stoke when I meant Villa was the team that marked Gerrard. You do make a good point when you say that if Gerrard can't play out of a situation, then who will? (probably not Lucas) But I think my point still stands that opponents will know to mark Gerrard and ensure he doesn't have time on the ball, and this could seriously disrupt our ability to possess and attack (at least without Allen in). Plus, they wouldn't pressure Lucas in the same way if he was playing there.

I think the main issue right now is what formation to play. We want to pair SAS up top, but it's not possible currently. We can't play 352, because we don't have the depth at CB, and our injuries at fullback mean there's not enough quality out wide to play such a demanding formation. A 442/4222 doesn't work as we have seen - we are outnumbered in the midfield and have no central presence. A 433 is tough because either Suarez or Sturridge will be on the wing, and having Gerrard at the single pivot wouldn't work well if he was paired in midfield with Hendo and Coutinho. 4231 is similar, because it splits up SAS.

I think 4231 would be best, for right now at least. Coutinho gets to play centrally, which is essential in my eyes. Hendo would just wouldn't be able to get forward as much when next to Gerrard, but that might be alright if we have Coutinho, SAS, and Sterling going at it. We played this against Bournemouth and the issues I saw were that the right back was often isolated against two as Suarez/Sturridge don't track with the necessary focus (their intention is good, but they don't mark as tight as is needed). I also felt like our midfield could be bypassed easily. I would think we stay in this formation, swapping Flanno for Kelly and Sterling for Moses vs. Everton.",0,1390762494,null,0,1390763935,0,cezeh4g,t3_1w7ab2,t1_cezeh4g,t1_cezdo8i,null,1432116656,12,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,12

Nah, seriously, it's going to be all okay.  The UK will be like the UK - a complete and utter melting pot that likes to talk about the weather and to take the proverbial michael out of itself.  We will continue to be a cultural giant whilst simultaneously pointing out our own flaws.

If you're worried about turning into US-lite or 'fucking Canada' (seriously, what was with all the f-bombs on Canada?!) then:

- you might want to question the Single Market which looks to open up national and social programmes to outside competition.  

- you might want to question why ACTA has been slipped undemocratically into the EU-Canadian Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) to manipulate IP rights, just like in NAFTA.

- you might want to question the effect the US-EU Free Trade Agreement will have on the NHS, which will mean that the NHS will have to compete for its own budget with US and overseas healthcare providers.   A few example articles:

But seriously, the whole *'more sovereignty actually means less sovereignty and control, and we'll all slowly turn into lost American tourists with no self-identity''* is a terrible argument to defend -  [**especially when you've got people in Europe arguing for a Post-National Federal Europe!!!**](http://www.spinelligroup.eu/sign-manifesto)",0,1390762846,null,0,false,0,cezemjj,t3_1w6vag,t1_cezemjj,t1_cezd710,null,1432116726,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

true,baycitytroller,cnty-scotland,Shang a lang,"Dennis Healey - Holyrood 19 May, 2013.

&gt;He says that the value of oil to the UK is a prime motivation behind Westminster’s opposition to independence now and in the 1970s.
&gt;
&gt;“I think we did underplay the value of the oil to the country because of the threat of nationalism but that was mainly down to Thatcher. We didn’t actually see the rewards from oil in my period in office because we were investing in the infrastructure rather than getting the returns and really, Thatcher wouldn’t have been able to carry out any of her policies without that additional 5 per cent on GDP from oil. Incredible good luck she had from that.” I ask Healey if he had considered establishing a sovereign wealth fund with the oil revenues to invest in the country’s future when he was in office.
&gt;
&gt;“It’s true that we should have invested the money in things we needed in Britain and I had thought about an oil fund, like in Norway but it wasn’t my responsibility by then.” I explain to him that the oil has become a controversial focus in the current referendum debate and wonder if he thinks Westminster is afraid of the consequences of independence.
&gt;
&gt;“I think there are a lot of problems connected with it that haven’t been faced up to, either by Salmond or by the British and they are mainly to do with oil and the income it provides and yes, I think they [Westminster politicians] are concerned about Scotland taking the oil, I think they are worried stiff about it.
&gt;
&gt;“I think we would suffer enormously if the income from Scottish oil stopped but if the Scots want it [independence] they should have it and we would just need to adjust but I would think Scotland could survive perfectly well, economically, if it was independent. Yes, I would think so… with the oil.” I ask Healey what he thinks about claims that Scotland is subsidised by the rest of the UK given that Joel Barnett, he of the Barnett formula, was his deputy at the Treasury and worked out what share of the national income pot Scotland should receive. He says Scotland “pays its fair share” and that “these myths” are simply perpetuated by those that oppose independence. On Scotland keeping the pound, he says Scotland would gain but adds that so “would the rest of us” and he doesn’t see why Westminster could say the Scots couldn’t have it.

- Flat down image of the texture of the table
- Make sure there's no-one bending over in the background 
- Use the oranges as a focus point and make it a bit more artsy
- Research other successful furniture shops and see what they do
- Frame out the electrical fire in the background (if possible) 
- Create more of a scene on the back wall to provide a good backdrop, or potentially try and get a plain white blanket (ironed) and hang to provide a plain background
- Clean the room a bit

I think it would be worth going to a bit of effort/time/hiring a photographer or studio to get some great shots of the table and chucking that on top of the price. If you're already charging 2.8k for a table, spending £200 on some decent photography and going to £3k with some decent pictures for a portfolio/magazine would be worthwhile and likely to increase likelihood of sale - both because of the value added in terms of listing but also because it's more likely to be used in social media if the images are friendly for it.

A 40% deposit is excellent. However, find a good broker, and seek their advice. You may find, subject to lenders criteria, 2x 20% deposits spread your risk and improve your cash flow. Positive cashflow from day one is key; buying based on the expectation of capital appreciation is speculation!

A good broker will advise you on lenders who will consider your circumstances. You may find yourself restricted if you aren't already a homeowner. Living in the house yourself may also complicate matters, and have tax/cost implications.

You're right that opponents will target Steven, but that's sort of inevitable, and nothing stops them targeting him while he has Lucas alongside him either. The presence of the 2 ahead of him will pin their double pivot back (which most PL sides use), but he didn't have that luxury vs. Villa as we played 4-2-4, which I'd either blame on the manager or the wingers depending on whether it was an intentional decision. Also it'll help Steven to have Sakho and Agger behind him as they can both pick passes through the midfield line much better than Skrtel and Toure. 

I agree the formation is a problem right now and it'll be interesting to see what Rodgers does about it. That said, the actual formation isn't always as important as it's made out, it's more about what the players are doing in transition (ie vs. Bournemouth we used a 4-2-3-1 shape to defend and more of a 4-3-3 in attack) and the principles of play. [This article by Jed Davies on our 3-4-1-2 earlier in the season explains a different example](http://eplindex.com/42126/liverpools-3-4-1-2-not-so-different-after-all-tactical-analysis.html).

I think you're right about playing 4-2-3-1 for the foreseeable future, and I think that's what Rodgers will do. I'm sure Steven will learn a lot from taking the majority of the defensive responsibility in a double pivot alongside Hendo/Allen which'll help him if and when we go back to 4-3-3 (in a similar way that playing 3-4-1-2 earlier in the season has helped us become more dynamic in position, CBs splitting etc). Furthermore, we can always switch during games so that Allen/Hendo push up alongside the 10 (incidentally I'd love to see an inform Coutinho deployed in a similar role to Iniesta for Barca). One of the biggest problems we face now is how to get one of Sturridge and Suarez to be happy to do the defensive stuff outwide though, although DS came here to stop playing out wide I think he'd be happy enough to play there so long as he's still getting a lot of chances and started every week. That said, I think he'll continue asking them to take turns like they did on Saturday. Fwiw, I thought whilst they didn't track their runner in the first half they were much more diligent in the second half (assumably after a stern word at half time from BR).",1,1390765133,null,0,1390766510,0,cezfloz,t3_1w7ab2,t1_cezfloz,t1_cezeh4g,null,1432117040,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

In living memory Hobsbawm was as left leaning as they come, yet he had no problem rationalising gulags and ethnic cleansing.

Surely the question should be expanded from what and in what sense?   Expanding frontline services or prison places and infrastucture needn't be left nor right if they're broken or overstretched.

No he's not.  He's calling the current system broken.   He is also saying we're letting criminals in, dealing with them later, and releasing them early due to infrastructure pressures and it all affects recidivism.  If anybody is genuinely arguing that Farage wants recidivism to go up and  more crime - when he actively wants to allow decriminalisation, then they're not even attempting to sound plausible.

Agreed.

But that doesn't actually change anything.   If a man walks into a doctor's and his issue is psychosomatic and not of a physical cause then she doesn't turn him away, she treats it.

If people are genuinely scared/worried/nervous even if it is not born out in reality and represented in the stats, then that fear/anxiety/stress is still very real.  If that can be fixed by putting a friendly bobby on the street, then great if it makes people feel better, promotes outreach, and brings a community together.

His game is all about deliberately picking up the ball in tight areas and moving it quickly to a team mate, which creates space by drawing the opponent in towards him, and then one of our other players can operate in that space and hurt the opposition. This is the role Xavi plays so well for Barca, hence the Welsh Xavi comparison. 

As for Coutinho, he'd mostly play on the left side of the front 3 (where he tends to play now), and he can play well there coming inside, playing throughballs, dribbling players and so on. As he did in the run of games between Spurs away and Hull at home last month. However, I'd love to see him tried as one of the midfield 3 (this is just me talking here, I haven't seen too much to suggest BR will try this), similar to what Iniesta does for Barca (a slightly more advanced version of the Xavi role, with more dribbling/through balls to provide penetration). If he could cope there physically and tactically then he could be great there alongside Henderson/Allen (although he's probably too raw right now and I wouldn't do it unless he was in good form which he isn't).",0,1390765674,null,0,false,0,cezftyr,t3_1w7ab2,t1_cezftyr,t1_cezf5wo,null,1435516947,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,Kesuke,null,null,"&gt; Tenants have a lot of rights, one is a ""habitable home"" and when Environmental Health are informed of the lack of heating - landlord will incur a fine if not fixed promptly!

I used to think this to, then I ended up in a house with a severe mold problem and the heating died. We jumped through all the hoops - citizens advice, the council, then the environmental health department of the local authority. It actually isn't anywhere near as straightforward as you think (or I thought). You can't just rock up at the council or environmental department of the local authority and have them force your landlord to do anything. 

First of all it depends on exactly what the problem is - and unless it is an immediate threat to life it must not predate the tenancy agreement. i.e. if you sign on for a house with a broken boiler and knew about it then you can't force the landlord to do anything about it. Other common problems like mold and damp are hugely complex. For example unforeseen problems with the structure of the property fall to the landlord to repair only where those exterior issues present a danger to public health - which is subject to interpretation. Some local authorities (and I believe Tower Hamlets are actually surprisingly considered the strictest) enforce this with a pretty firm hand. Others (in my experience the majority) take more of a ""meh"" approach. It then gets even more complicated if the owner of the exterior property (as in a flat block or converted flats) isn't the same person as the owner of your flat within that property. It drags on and on and on and you have very little ability to intervene - because whilst you could theoretically *""take your landlord to court yadayadayada""* if you actually look into it and see what it costs... it'd be cheaper to just buy the property from your landlord and make the repairs yourself... but seriously, you can be looking at tens of thousands of pounds - your annual rent, just to fix a broken boiler. And chances are, if you've got cash like that sat around you probably aren't renting. 

Ultimately, the biggest problem is simply one of time. If you take the legal approach it can take anywhere up to a year to get close to a court - by which time you'll have been served with section 21 notice simply for having the nerve to question your lord and master. This is a flaw in our rental system - in other countries like Germany you can only evict tenants for certain reasons like non-payment of rent... even if you claim you want to use a property for your own uses, you actually have to demonstrate it! For example by providing details that it will be your main residence or is cheaper than your current residence. If you lie, your former tenants can take you to court for it and you are liable to pay their legal expenses. You also have to give between a minimum of 3 and maximum of 9 months notice depending on how long the tenant has lived there! Far cry from the 4 weeks that is standard here. 

----------

&gt; Sorry, your incorrect about tenant rights.

No I'm not. It's endlessly frustrating trying to explain this to people who have not been through this process. I mean at the end of the day you can either believe me or not - but I've rented for 9 years, and had 2 properties in particular that were so bad they needed escalation to the authorities. I can tell you from bitter personal experience that it **is not** straightforward and at just about every step it feels as though things are setup deliberately to protect the landlord... and they are! It is a flaw of our rental laws which are effectively based on centuries old legislation designed for a time when landowners were wealthy aristocrats and pioneering industrialists - and their tenants were illiterate working class nobodies that didn't matter in the eyes of the law. The law in this country needs a radical overhaul - firstly to protect tenants like they have done in Germany, and secondly to give landlords more powers to reclaim money when it is rightfully due - for example for non-payment of rent or for when damage to a property exceeds the damages deposit.",0,1390767194,null,0,1390767539,0,cezghu7,t3_1w448r,t1_cezghu7,t1_cezerds,null,1432117421,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The government is going to need alcoholic drinks for functions.  This is an accepted custom in our society and an inevitable necessity.  

The government is therefore going to need to buy drinks: it will want to buy them cheaply, to avoid wasting the money of taxpayers.  However, it also needs to buy good drinks, to uphold its reputation and prestige (I don't want to overstate this, obviously the state of the government does not depend on the winelist etc but clearly the quality does matter).

Fortunately, the government is able to contact various experts who will happily provide their services.  With their help, they are able to buy drinks that will be expensive, but aren't now.  

Even better, if they buy more drinks than they will eventually need, they can make it sustainable, or even in good years turn a profit, all through the proceeds of selling alcohol.

This both fulfils the obligations of the government to provide drinks at its functions, and totally avoids inconveniencing the taxpayer.  It manages to turn what could be a necessary source of expenditure into a helpful source of mild profit.  Whitehall is doing this because if they didn't, the alcohol they would have to buy would not be essentially free.

But I would implore you to look beyond that and try to understand the current situation. There are certainly some people looking for property in their late 20s/early 30s who are frankly unrealistic. But there are also other people who by traditional standards ought to be able to afford reasonable property - teachers, lawyers, doctors, engineers. David Cameron used the example of a married Nurse and Teacher in his help to buy speech. These are young professionals earning upwards of £35K... These guys ought to be able to afford property, but it is staggeringly difficult if they don't have parents to front them the deposit. The extension of the help to buy scheme is a step in the right direction, but there simply isn't the availability of that sort of property and what is available has simply been pushed up in price. One of the factors that is helping push up the price is that those kind of ""fixer-upper"" starter properties also make good rental prospects. 

&gt; You can get on the ladder but you refuse to compromise which is why you're still living at home with mummy and daddy sponging off them like the child you are.

I rent. I haven't lived with my parents since I was 18. 

What I will concede is that part of this misunderstanding may be coming from the fact you are in East Yorkshire and I am in the South East where I suspect the differences in the property and rental markets are night and day. But pick up a newspaper... this isn't some madeup bullshit, real human beings are caught up in a rental trap. It also puts them in a very vulnerable position if they have children.

&gt;The Times on Friday reported that Policy Exchange - which was set up by the education secretary - and Civitas were preparing to call for a radical overhaul of the Ofsted inspection regime, claiming it was trapped by 1960s ""progressive"" approaches to learning.

Which is a right wing criticism from right wing think tanks.

true,lithaborn,null,null,"&gt; if the 4th doctor was aware of the Time War, don't you think he or the 5th or 6th would have tried to stop it from ever happening?

For the same reasons the 3rd, 4th, 5th or 6th did nothing to stop the events depicted in ""The two doctors"" perhaps?

For the same reasons the 6th, 7th, 8th or 9th did nothing to warn #10 of the ""Time crash"" incident, maybe?

Maybe, even, we could rolll out the old trope of it being a fixed point in time and space and that it *must* happen...

&gt; And if the 4th Doctor knew that Gallifrey was saved, then why did the 9th and 10th claim they destroyed it?

Well, I do happen to remember some very pointed references to why 10 and 11 don't remember anything about the Time War conclusion, or the War Doctor in general, so there's that reason. Also, The Curator very clearly stated, in reply to 11's suggestion that Gallifrey didn't burn...""Who nose"".

And I don't think I'm overanalysing at all. I think I'm taking the simplest possible explanation and running with it. I think I'm taking all the nudge nudge wink wink undertones of the scene at face value for what they were - a none too subtle breaking of the fourth wall to telegraph that Moffatt deliberately wrote the scene to appear ambiguous while in actual fact, it's really not.

Here's the simplest interpretation: While travelling alone, No.4 gets wind of this strangely familar painting - ""Gallifrey falls"". He investigates and learns exactly what it is. In the process, he leanrs of Kate L.S's collection at the Tower and decides that's the safes t place for it, where he can keep an eye on it. He spends some significant amount of time looking after it, growing artificially old so as to better fit in over the years with the humans around him. When the time comes, he disappears, returns to his more usual appearance and continues with his televised adventures. Simple, elegant, possible. Why not? It's a lot more poignant and in keeping with the spirit of the scene and the 50th anniversary than having yet another future Doctor randomly pop up for three minutes. We'd already had Capaldi's eyes.

I suspect it's always going to be easier for men to sacrifice their family lives for politics, because men have a smaller biological investment in raising their children.  Men don't have to endure pregnancy and once the child is born men are probably biologically predisposed to be on average less interested in nurturing.  

Nature isn't fair when it comes to sex discrimination, because nature discriminates quite a lot when it comes to which gender has to do most of the work.

It may be that men should be encouraged to do more to help in raising their children and that women should be given help to minimize the cost to their careers from giving birth and raising kids.  That's something that society has to decide, but whatever we choose it's not doing anyone any favors to ignore the fact that men are different from women and likely have different interests and goals in life.

If only I hadn't been listening to their new policy discussions, their official policy spokespeople, and the 2013 Local Manifestos and policy which IS on their site  - then you might have had a point.  But no.

&gt;**Not a policy at the moment**

Actually, since they have since said it is, then it is.   Farage said that he wouldn't be beholden to the 2010 manifesto and it's not particularly strange that this story has popped up now when their own website was saying it *back in September!*

The reason why it is coming out now is because going into the Wythenshawe &amp; Sale East by election it has come out that Labour intends to run an attack campaign on UKIP's 2010 policy.   So Farage simply replied that he wasn't leader at the time, and they're releasing new manifestos all the time (last year we had locals, there's a European one coming for May, and they've pushed the General one back to later in the year).  I was laughing the other day when the story was breaking because I knew the context.  Farage went on air and shot the Labour by-election strategy fox.  

None of that means that they have zero policy now and everything is cancelled.  They have policy spokespeople announcing current policy and Farage is always talking about what we should do - he's never off Question Time for heaven's sake.  We're not in a 2010 timewarp.  There have been other years since then and now!!!

&gt;**Introducing student grants: But getting rid of student loans. We've been here before and it resulted in only the rich being able to afford university.**

It's a private company.  If you're getting free education, free grants, and you don't want to take out a loan, get a job like plenty of students do.  

The sense of entitlement you are showing when in response to a policy to scrap tuition fees and encourage grants you say, but *I want a government loan too!*

&gt;**Investing in grammar schools for the poor but academically gifted: This isn't close to being a left wing policy.**

Why do you associate being academic with right wing?

Are we not talking about the state putting up funding for academically geared state schools in every town, so children of parents that can't afford to move to catchment areas of better schools, can still cultivate their ambitions.


&gt;**A referendum on drugs: no evidence this is even a policy, more an offhand comment made by Farage in one of his many interviews**

Well he said it in a radio panel-interview but you not knowing where else it is backed up is not an argument against the policy.

Let me tell you that Direct Democracy and Localism, with binding local and national referendums, is very much a cornerstone.  [Patrick O'Flynn the new UKIP media chappy was talking about it only last week when Conservative Zac Goldsmith MP raised up the issue of Direct Democracy.](https://twitter.com/ZacGoldsmith/status/423452518648000512/photo/1)

&gt;**Direct democracy: The only evidence of referendums is on the EU. Not that direct democracy is necessarily a left wing policy.**

Evidently not so.  Currently on their site, page one, section one, of 'What We Stand For':
     
          ""Give the public power to require binding local and 
           national referenda on major issues.""

http://ukip.org/issues/policy-pages/what-we-stand-for

&gt;**Against privatisation of the NHS: But they want to peg the funding to what we currently doing, so with an ageing population will result in a poorer service.**

Let's get one thing straight, you're saying that I'm arguing for something which will ultimately lead to more stress on the NHS, and you're arguing for just giving up and accepting privatisation.   

Of course I do have the argument going for me that they have a former consultant and radiographer for the NHS making and speaking UKIP policy.  That they want to change procurement to save money, as argued by an NHS oncologist at their conference.  They argue for devolving more powers to local government so it can be more tailored to meet demands.  That by having controls on immigration, there'll be less stress now and not on a never-never argument some time in the future - but if they need to bring more people in later, then they have that control and option.  Let's not get into how they'll be getting a smaller percentage but of a much bigger share as tax avoidance companies start coming to the UK instead of funneling money out.

&gt;**For Glass-Steagall bank regulation. I'll give you that one, because I know very little about it.**

Thank you, but to be fair you've displayed poor understanding of the actual UKIP position and recent events up until now.  I don't blame you, but you've clearly been talking out of unqualified assumption.

&gt;**Against cuts to Legal Aid: Apart from an offhand comment, there doesn't seem to be much to back this up. But for the purposes of marking, I'll let you have it.**

It comes up quite often.

Not much to back it up?   It's been in the news only recently.   
It's on their website.  You simply mustn't have looked!

http://www.ukip.org/newsroom/news/658-why-ukip-supports-the-lawyers-against-planned-cuts-to-legal-aid

&gt;**Against defacto media censorship under Leveson: Against regulation against media, rather than censorship. I don't believe this is a left wing policy (if I remember correctly, both Clegg and Miliband wanted greater oversight, whereas Cameron didn't).**

On face value it isn't a right or a leftwing policy.

When you look at it, and that it means small publishers being eligible for court costs even if they're found to be in the right then it very much is a left-right issue in that it practically creates a corporate  media cartel hitting the small and local news sources disproportionately.   Even if they are completely in the right for publishing a story it could still end up costing them.  It would effectively take big business out of the league of local press on threat of court fees alone. 

Farage I'll remind you was himself a victim of phone hacking.  He took the Hislop line.  It was already illegal what happened.  Punish it with the existing laws - don't punish innocent publishers with costs larger corporations can deal with because they'll go out of business.

&gt;**His 'for SMEs' is actually just against workers rights.**

Which is transparently not true.   Example?  Fighting against quotas over meritocracy.  That's actually arguing for a worker to be promoted according to their ability and their effort.  Another example?  Allowing open and flexible contract discussion.  Worker's rights won't disappear just as company cars and other perks haven't disappeared despite not being regulated.  There will still be contract law, obviously, and rights, but there will be an emphasis on smaller companies competing with bigger companies by using their flexibilty.

Over 85% of business is non EU related yet 100% of UK business comes under EU regulations.  Excessive regulation: take the rocks of the lawn instead of trying to teach the grass to grow.

Oh, and that Direct Democracy thing you didn't think existed but is on their site?  Get 10% of the electorate to sign a petition and we'll be writing a new Bill of Rights for the 21st Century, complete with worker rights tailored for the UK.

That's how Direct Democracy works.  

&gt;**Devolving power away from central government: But bringing more of it back to central government from the EU, let's not forget.**

Not more of it.        
All of it.       

All of it from Brussels to Westminster, a massive share of it from Wesminster to Local Authorities.

It actually means MORE devolution and more power to local government, not less.   You're making my point.

&gt;**I'll give you 3/10 of the left wing policies. Not that we really know what their policies are, given how often they give up on policies and just argue for populist things.**

I think I just picked up my other 7.

Moreover, Arsenal had a good, solid team that took more points than anyone else in the prem over the second half of last year. They didn't need to be picked up out of the mid-table.

United do. They've been beaten at home already this year more often than any two years under Ferguson, they look a shambles in defense quite often, and they struggle to put the ball in the net when van Persie and Rooney aren't playing. Mata only solves one of those issues, AND United are likely losing Vidic and Evra this summer, two veteran players who ""know how to win"". They're also negotiating a contract with Rooney, and you have to think he'll be looking at the Mata purchase as stepping on his toes.

My point is, the Ozil transfer was a statement of intent from a team that ended last season on a high note, with a young squad that had finally managed to come together, and have since been very healthy.

The Mata transfer is an attempt to salvage a season that looks increasingly lost; out of the League Cup, no real shot at winning the Champion's League, 6 points from the Champion's League places, much less the title, and their two best players have been in and out of the physio's room all year.

I don't know whether it's because Farage is far better at PR than anyone else in the party (Lord Pearson wasn't exactly great at it when he was their leader), or whether he just wants to hog all the attention for himself, but if they made an effort to put several other reasonable, mainstream spokespeople in the spotlight, it would be a lot harder to paint the party as consisting of just Nigel Farage and an army of nutters.

Secondly, even if you completely reject the idea that UKIP is xenophobic, racist, misogynistic and homophobic, you have to admit that they sail pretty close to the wind on these subjects with their opposition to same-sex marriage, scepticism about gender equality in the workplace, support for banning headscarves, constant complaining about ""political correctness"" and human rights/equality law, and so on.

It's going to cost a fair bit to do all of this in one chunk do you have enough money set aside to do all of this? I can't remember howmuch my CBT was but it cost about £600(6, 3 hour blocks) in lessons to get my A2 licence. Plus you have all your driving lessons and theorys.

In terms of how long it takes it depends on your situation, where I went you could do an intensive 3 day period, doing 3 hours a day over 3 days then take your MOD1 then do the same for your MOD2 or space them out to say one lesson a week. 

I'd say pass your CBT and give it a few months to get used to it all and to be confident on the road, it's all fine and dandy being able to practice in a car park but you will learn a lot more on the roads. Then book your lessons for your A2. All I will say is don't book your MOD1 and MOD2 at the same time, wait until you pass your MOD1 then book your MOD2, I've seen plenty of people fail their MOD1 then waste £90 because then then can't sit their MOD2.

Gulags and ethnic cleansing wouldn't really apply in this discussion, as methods of dealing with crime have to obey the U.N. charter on Human Rights to be legitimate. Being an authoritarian, oppressive cunt is separate from left and right.

An example of a right wing system in Criminology would be the U.S.A. e.g. 3 strikes and we sentence them to a life time of rape in prison.

An example of a Left wing system would be Norway where [they try to rehabilitate rather than punish where possible](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1384308/Norways-controversial-cushy-prison-experiment--catch-UK.html)

Criminology, in general (regardless of other political views), massively favors the left wing approach because, frankly, the right wing approach is stupid and doesn't work. So when Farage advocates harsher sentences and extra police, *criminologically* it would be right wing. EDIT: If you believe in strict punishment rather than rehabilitation right wing is probably the system for you.

true,wherearemyfeet,null,null,"&gt;They're sports, sure. Big is a subjective term

With over a million people owning guns in the UK, that's a pretty big number.

&gt;If you want to have a sport where you shoot, fine. The club owns the guns, and keeps them in a suitably fortified armoury, with alarm systems linked to the Police. People can check guns out of there, and check them back in when they're done.

This is impractical for people who attend numerous clubs, or regularly go to different events. Also, the sheer lack of any crime coming from legally held guns makes this impractical suggestion unnecessary. It's nothing more than an attempt to pacify people's fears with no gain towards public safety. You're trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist.

&gt;I still don't see the need to have a pistol.

Target and practical shooting. Is that not a good enough ""need""? Why are you the person to decide ""need""?

&gt;In my mind, people personally owning guns increases the likelyhood that they're going to be used for something other than target shooting.

An assertion that is simply not supported by evidence.

&gt;Be it self-defence

The idea that someone would go through all the rigmarole of getting a FAC to only have it for self defence makes no sense.

&gt;or robbery/assault.

That makes literally no sense whatsoever. You really think that a criminal would sign up to a gun club (where his details are accessible by the police and the Home Office) for a minimum of 6 months to begin with (plus remain a member of at least one club indefinitely as long as they hold the certificate), be identified as ""good character"" by other members and the club secretary who want to keep criminals out of their club, get an independent professional to verify them, then give all their private details to the police and agree to an interview and home inspection by the police, not to mention pay inflated sums for each gun that will be individually marked on their FAC and registered, plus buy a safe (another regular home by the police) in order to get hold of firearms..... when they can speak to this guy they know down the pub?

I really don't mean to come across as dismissive, but if you think a criminal is going to get an FAC and get legal guns to commit crimes, then I suspect you don't understand the endless hoops you have to jump through in order to obtain one.

&gt;guns are designed with a single purpose; killing people, quickly, with minimal training and danger to the aggressor. Any other uses are incidental, or came after that initial design.

You know, I could make exactly the same claim for baseball bats and cricket bats, right? Especially as they are the 2nd most frequently used weapons in assaults and homicide in the UK behind knives, and legally held firearms don't even appear on the figures. You don't need me to point out that when humans first started using bats, it wasn't for sporting purposes.

This is a ""nanny-state"" issue, because your fear of legally held guns doesn't come from any facts or statistics relating to the threat they pose to you. They pose practically zero threat to you, yet you fear them. Baseball bats pose a comparitavely larger threat to you (especially as anyone can go into a sports shop and buy one, no questions asked, no records kept) and yet this doesn't seem to phase you?

&gt;People I meet day to day in cars are arrogant, quick to anger, and above all really fucking stupid. I'd prefer not to give them another tool to fuck things up with, especially one that is so effective.

That's not a valid comparison. People get angry in cars as someone else's balls-up on the roads can lead to an expensive and long process in sorting things out, or could kill them, hence why it irritates people so much. A better analogy would be people walking on the street, and 99.9% of the people I walk past on the street are ordinary folks who don't give me any cause for concern.

Also, we're not talking about people having guns next to them in the car, so I don't know what you're trying to lead to there.",0,1390773156,null,0,false,0,cezj340,t3_1w1kdt,t1_cezj340,t1_ceze487,null,1432118739,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,deadgreystar,null,null,"I worked in mortgages until recently with a major lender, and while making riskier borrowers pay higher rates is industry standard -- more borrowing inherently means more risk -- this seems a bit strange.

I'm not familiar with Santander's policies but ours were that the 'deal' the customer was on could be switched to a new deal at the end of the term so they wouldn't need to go onto the standard variable rate. This prevents clients leaving for another lender to remortgage and provided a way to change onto what could be a favourable rate for the customer without having to go through the application process or any form of credit scoring.

What seems strange about the cases mentioned in the article is that they all waited until after their deals ceased to look for new ones and that Santander was deeming some unable to transfer due to credit scoring. However, maybe that is Santander policy, it's tough to say without knowledge of how they work.

That being said, they are basically stuck in that situation because if they move to another lender, they will have to apply for a remortgage, and this includes credit scoring. This will highlight the default and in most cases mean their applications will be declined; I know my company wouldn't proceed with a client with any form or size of default unless it was registered on their credit file in error.

true,whencanistop,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt; None of that means that they have zero policy now and everything is cancelled. They have policy spokespeople announcing current policy and Farage is always talking about what we should do - he's never off Question Time for heaven's sake. We're not in a 2010 timewarp. There have been other years since then and now!!!

It shows a bit of a weakness in policy when you completely disavow your policies less than three years later.   How can we be sure that the ones stated now are going to be in place in any meaningful time period.  A period of government is 5 years.  They can't even agree to keep them for four.  Why are we believing anything they are saying now.  Especially when they're not really announcing them as policies, it is just while Farage is chatting away on Question Time.

&gt; &gt; Introducing student grants: But getting rid of student loans. We've been here before and it resulted in only the rich being able to afford university.

&gt; It's a private company. If you're getting free education, free grants, and you don't want to take out a loan, get a job like plenty of students do.

&gt; The sense of entitlement you are showing when in response to a policy to scrap tuition fees and encourage grants you say, but I want a government loan too!

I thought you were trying to say that these were left wing policies and not right wing policies.  In the old days, you only got to go to university if you were rich, because you couldn't afford to do so otherwise.  A weak grant system that barely covered a month of living costs meant that university was elitist.  Moving from grants to student loans meant that each young adult started from a much leveller playing field.  God forbidden the entitlement of want a cheap, government backed loan though.

&gt; Why do you associate being academic with right wing?

Did I say I did?  I suggested that grammar schools were elitist (I should know, I went to one).  Why do you insist on making up arguments for the opposition.

&gt; Well he said it in a radio panel-interview but you not knowing where else it is backed up is not an argument against the policy.

Of course, because that's where you announce your policies in a way that means the electorate knows you are going to stick to them and not dump them after 3 years when someone starts questioning them.

&gt; Let's get one thing straight, you're saying that I'm arguing for something which will ultimately lead to more stress on the NHS, and you're arguing for just giving up and accepting privatisation.

I'm not arguing for either.  I would be spending more money on the NHS and looking at doing preventative health first and foremost to cut our spending. Not simply pegging it to some arbitary spending limit and making it so that your health care professionals aren't trained properly.

&gt; &gt; His 'for SMEs' is actually just against workers rights.

&gt;Which is transparently not true. Example?

You mean apart from the ones I already mentioned?  Like getting rid of the working time directive that means that employers can make workers work longer under the guise of better negotiation (because we know who has the balance of power in that relationship)?  Like removing health and safety regulations so that employers can cut back on making people safer.  Like removing 'green' regulations that allow workers a better working environment.  

&gt; It's clear that you're not informed on this, which is fine. Just don't try lecturing somebody that has a bit of a sturdier handle on it. Or do, but it turns it into more of an exhibition game.

It's clear to me that you are so far into this, you don't know where to stop.  You can't even see what is staring you in front of your own eyes.  UKIP are a right wing party.

true,sacredstones,null,null,"good post, but it won't work in game unless Gerrard ups his defensive ability. you mentioned a bunch of stats in your last comment reply. But if you actually watched the Bournemouth game, he missed a lot tackles and there were multiple moments when he was caught watching. He was very late to help Kelly on the right. Lots of moments when he would spot the danger too late and end up missing the tackle. He's best used as a pure penetrator, but defensively, he's a liability. Bournemouth didn't get many shots but thats largely due to their general lack of quality and Martin Skrtel. If you focus on Gerrard for the entirety of the match you'll see a few things :

1. Bournemouth didn't press the middle. This makes Gerrard seem a better passer than he really is. And by that i'm not talking about his technique, but in the speed of his decision making. He had loads to time to pick his pass, whereas against Villa, he was under heavy pressure and gave away a lot of passes in the first half as the holding mid. The Pivot role is all about moving the ball on quickly to keep possession. When Lucas plays holding, he's able to recycle with the back four and then Find Steven to start a play. This works so well because Gerrard has time to settle, find space, and decide before hand what his passing options are. When Lucas came on against Villa, Gerrards passing was much more accurate and much smarter. I don't have stats to back it up, but if you watch the first half, and then the first 20 min of the second half, the difference is quite obvious. 

2. His defensive positioning and general reading of the game is poor. ",0,1390774343,null,0,false,0,cezjlmy,t3_1w7ab2,t1_cezjlmy,t3_1w7ab2,null,1432118984,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

&gt;MPs don't earn 1% wages (they'd need to earn roughly another £100K or 2.5x their salary to reach that). Even David Cameron in the 'top' job would need another £20K.

I know and I never said they did. I was replying to the now deleted comment that roughly said why do we envy those who have busted their balls and studied/worked hard at unsociable hours to earn a 1% salary. I'd prefer MPs got paid more with the expenses system tightened

&gt;Whether they're in a party that makes it so that benefits can sustain you as long as you need or to design the benefits system around prodding you to get back into work, both parties are sticking to what they feel makes a country and its people successful.

That is true but it's a poor implementation. Both parties have worked to ensure the sick and disabled suffer under ESA assessments. Also which party is the former? I'd like to vote for them but they don't exist

&gt; most Tory MPs still want to make the country a better place. When you consider just how little of a gap their is between Labour and the Tories in terms of where they stand in the political spectrum, that kind of cartoonish portrayal of them is even more farcical

It says a lot more about Labour than the Tories. At least we've always known what the latter stand for. I'll agree that most MPs want to make the country a better place but you should add ""for whom?"" to the end of that sentence because the Tories have done very little to help the poorest and actively campaigned against AV

I would really just move that Cash ISA into a stocks and shares ISA. You aren't even offsetting inflation with that miserable 1.1%, and its going to be some time before the interest rate allows you to even preserve capital

You have a reasonable emergency pot in your current account and savings, so there's probably no reason to be accepting ultra-conservative risk on the ISA. Commit to locking it away for a decent amount of time and suddenly you can be getting an average of 5-7% compounded annual growth on it.

For the £1k surplus you want to invest, think about increasing your pension contributions to take advantage of the employer matching, but personally I'd only do this once you are maxing your ISA each year.

Also see if your employer has an employee share option scheme. Usually these offer share options in your company at a discounted rate. Im not sure you can put options in an ISA, but once the option matures you could transfer them (or just sell them for profit to use elsewhere).

&gt;

&gt;The **Maginot Line** (French: Ligne Maginot, IPA: [liɲ maʒino]), named after the French Minister of War André Maginot, was a line of concrete fortifications, obstacles, and weapons installations that France constructed along its borders with Germany during the 1930s. The line was a response to France's experience in World War I and was constructed during the run-up to World War II. A similar line of defenses, called the Alpine Line, faced Italy.

&gt;The French established the fortification to provide time for their army to mobilize in the event of attack, allowing French forces to move into Belgium for a decisive confrontation with Germany. The success of static, defensive combat in World War I was a key influence on French thinking. Military experts extolled the Maginot Line as a work of genius, believing it would prevent any further invasions from the east.

&gt;While the fortification system did prevent a direct attack, it was strategically ineffective, as the Germans invaded through  ...

&gt;It's clear to me that you are so far into this, you don't know where to stop. You can't even see what is staring you in front of your own eyes. UKIP are a right wing party. Here is some independent analysis. Of course you won't believe that because you're too blinkered.

Nope.  

I said they weren't a far-right party and the left-right model is utterly broken.  It was in my very first line of my first post:

       ""When people refer to him as far-right it goes some way 
        to explain just how broken both the model and perceptions 
        are when you consider this 'far-right' leader argues:""

My argument is that on various policies they appear at different places across the spectrum and they don't fit well into the left-right dynamic at all, which is when I went on to provide some counter-examples, and is why I finished the first comment with:

        ""Far-right is a misnomer. 
         Populist arguably is not - but of course he just 
         rebrands the pejorative as 'common sense'.""

And where does 'populist' sit on the spectrum?  It doesn't sit in one place. It isn't a single point, rather more like a wave across the spectrum.  Do some populist movements have more predominantly right wing policies than left, or vice-versa?  Yes, but if they have a mixture, as I've shown, then fixing them to an averaged point is subjective at best - if not outright crude- but one thing they are certainly not is 'far-right'.",0,1390777395,null,0,1390777717,0,cezkwu4,t3_1w6vag,t1_cezkwu4,t1_cezjexu,null,1432119673,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3

true,m1dn1ght5un,cnty-england,England,"I'd vote Conservative, though given I live in a staunch Labour area I am really just wasting my time. Reasons?

1. I agree with the Conservative approach on the economy more than Labour's. It's all very well and good to talk about spending your way out of a recession, but that argument relies upon you having put money aside during the boom years. Given that Brown/Balls decided the best course of events in a boom was to go on a spending binge, it didn't really leave the government a lot of options. Other countries had mended the roof while the sun was shining (e.g. Australia) but having ended boom and bust, Brown didn't really see that as a priority.

2. Much more important than my opinion on the Tories is my feelings on the current Labour leadership. I don't want Ed Balls anywhere near No. 11. Having him in charge of the UK budget fills me with dread. Ed Miliband doesn't appear to embody any of the characteristics I look for in a leader. It's not so much that I love the Tories, but I despise many on the Labour front bench (Miliband, Balls, Harman, Alexander, Cooper etc)

3. I like Gove's 'free school' policy. 

4. I trust the Tories *marginally* more on civil liberties.

5. I tend to support the Government more on foreign policy. For instance their approach to the EU and their stance on Syria. I felt like the government was right to take a hard line on Syria's use of chemical weapons and believe that it was only the threat of the US taking military action which forced Syria to dismantle their stockpiles.

true,rough_outline,lfc68,,"I think we're at the stage where Gerrard needs to be phased out of the team. This defensive midfielder experiment seems to be about finding any way to fit Gerrard in the team, he is not suited to the role at all.

You mention Lucas slows our attacks, however our best football this season has been when we've had Lucas, Allen and Henderson in midfield. Comparing Lucas and Gerrard isn't as simple as saying Gerrard is better than Lucas either. I'm afraid that Rodgers has looked at Gerrard and thought 'he's a more attacking Lucas' when Gerrard doesn't do the simple things that Lucas does. Lucas is far, far better at standing tackles, interceptions and heading, crucial qualities for a defensive midfielder.

Back to Gerrard though, the comparisons with Pirlo are way off, just because he is statistically similar, it does not mean he can play the same role or play like Pirlo. The best holding midfielders are thinkers. Pirlo, Alonso, Busquets are all thinking a million different thoughts ([this pic sums up that type of midfielder](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-c5PxR42S54s/TgDL3rQB2QI/AAAAAAAABE8/-wq8f192NW8/s1600/playmaker.png)). Gerrard has always been blood and thunder, a real roy of the rovers midfielder, his mentality does not suit the role.

Pirlo/Alonso/Busquets can all cope with pressure, they can use their to shield the ball, use their quick feet to evade danger but Gerrard panics in our third. Against Villa, there was a few times where found himself with the ball facing our goal and he didn't know what to do, same thing against Stoke.

There are so many reasons why I think playing Gerrard in this role is a terrible idea, both for him and more importantly the team. Even if he could one day be perfect for this role, how long will we have to carry Gerrard in this role as he adapts? This season is unbelievably crucial, getting top four is so important, yet we're messing about with the midfield are finding a winning combination.

With Lucas' injury, unless we buy an actual defensive midfielder, then we're pretty much forced to play Gerrard there but I do not think it suits him at all and our midfield will suffer because of it.",0,1390778856,null,0,false,0,cezlixm,t3_1w7ab2,t1_cezlixm,t3_1w7ab2,null,1432119975,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

So do.you think it would have been right for them to publish that report which may have encouraged a tenth of that population to selfishly keep the oil for themselves and get rich while the rest of us struggle without? I don't at all blame you for wanting the best for scotland and speaking up where it's not receiving fair benefits (eg oil.money in proportion to population) but don't act like the rest of us don't matter.

I agree the current political setup is too centralised and many parts of the country are suffering. Scotland is by no means the worst affected im that regard - it has its own government and own voice. Unlike parts of england that have no voice at all with which to demand fairer treatment, or government to arrange spending. Fixing that is going to require a lot of time, effort and money.

Why doesn't alex salmond aim to become pm of the uk and actually deal with the problems he complains about, helping significantly more people in the process? It would have been easier and less painful to achieve than independence I'm sure.

I just don't get nationalism of any kind, or all of the anger and hostility you seem to be displaying. We're all human beings, whether we're scottish or not doesn't matter because being scottish means absolutely nothing, just like any other nationality.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"No, that's a fair concern.  I'll give you that.

What they have said to address it is two fold.  First you have to appreciate that they also propose devolving much of the powers down to local government.   To give you an example around 70% of the public spend in the UK goes through and is broadly controlled the central government, Westminster, with the rough 30% remainder going through local government.  In Germany however the opposite is true in that around 70% of the public spend goes its states, and ~30% from the central government.  What UKIP has proposed (and also to some greater and lesser extent so have Labour and Conservative backbenchers) is that much more should be controlled locally even to the point of allowing local fiscal powers (to raise and lower taxes within certain percentage margins, and to keep more of the revenue).  How this relates to Direct Democracy is UKIP has proposed both local and national binding referendums, but if they're devolving most of the power to local levels then nothing is really cast in stone.   If one county has a local referendum on x and votes yes, then another county has a local referendum on y and votes no, then it will be easier to see which policy is working best and for counties to self-correct.  Nothing really is fixed, it just allows issues and topics and agendas which aren't necessarily politically expedient to be addressed.

The second argument relates to national referendums.  Here UKIP is Royal Commission happy (we hardly ever have Royal Commissions).  A Royal Commission is an independent body, made up by a host of experts, that reviews the situation and provides findings.  So on matter of a national referendum you'd have an independent body whose objective would be provide a case study, to provide alternatives and potential policies, to show the risks, how much it will cost, and then you can go forward and establish a referendum question and lay out the options.   Nobody is going to be voting for free weekly tourist rocket trips to the moon once a Royal Commission has cost appraised it, run it past the engineers, the lawyers, the economists - nor will such silly referendums come about because they set the petition requirement at 10% which is actually quite high.  So you're only going to get the most pressing matters through, it will be quite sober because you'll have a Royal Commission to direct the direction of the debate - and then any bill will still have to go through the Commons, the Lords, back again - and then possibly back to referendum.  The arguments will be annoyingly pragmatic - and nothing like previous referendums if the Royal Commission can  assure impartiality, but that is what our legal system is based on and does.  It is also what our political system is not and doesn't.

It is by no means going to encourage rash decisions.  It will if anything be frustratingly slow for all but the most clear cut decisions but it will empower an informed debate and revitalise the political apathy that has begun to consume the LibLabCon dynamic.

You get the same benefits whether you're first, second, third generation or whatever.  They've not proposed any different.  

The vast majority of Afro Caribbean/South Asians in London have been here for generations.  Race doesn't even come into it.  If you have family links in a locality then that is taken into consideration when prioritising social housing.  This would apply to them so they are less likely to have to leave neighbourhoods against  their wishes and where they have grown up!

Why would you bring race into it?

If you have family links in a location then you have priority over somebody that has no preexisting links and is much easier for them to settle where there's less demand on services.

There is no race aspect to it.  There is no box to tick in that regard.  If you have family links in a town or borough you will receive priority because they are looking to build *COMMUNITY* and *INTEGRATION*.  If you have no long term links but now qualify for housing benefit then you'll get it but you may have to move to somewhere where there is less demand for social housing.

On the ranges point, why is it wrong for someone to set up a private range on their property if they can do it safely? I recognise i'm in a minority but I also think that self defense is a valid reason to own a gun, so there's that.

Not meaning to be rude but I think your last paragraph is quite naive. Lawmakers act in their own best interest, not in the best interest of the population. This means that populist laws get passed when they are supported by shoddy arguments, because even if lawmakers know they're silly, they also know that lots of voters don't. Drug laws are a great example of this, completely ineffective, but only now becoming somewhat unpopular. The idea of drugs being illegal making less people take them doesn't hold water, but a lot of people think it does.

As another aspect on that, the burden of proof should always be on the side of those wishing to prohibit something. If we want a free society, people should be free to engage in behavior unless there is strong evidence of harm to others as a result. When the course of action your proposing involves locking people in cages for breaking the rules, I do think you need better reasoning than ""I'm sure someone else has thought of this""

And who didn't offer the slightest bit of resistance when 30,000 german troops marched towards them? France. And what impact did that have on how it all played out afterwards?

Here's some interesting reading:

&gt;Heinz Guderian, a German general interviewed by French officers after the Second World War, claimed: ""If you French had intervened in the Rhineland in 1936 we should have been sunk and Hitler would have fallen"".[24] A German officer assigned to the Bendlerstrasse during the crisis told H. R. Knickerbocker during the Spanish Civil War: ""I can tell you that for five days and five nights not one of us closed an eye. We knew that if the French marched, we were done. We had no fortifications, and no army to match the French. If the French had even mobilized, we should have been compelled to retire."" The general staff, the officer said, considered Hitler's action suicidal.[25]:26 Hitler himself said:

&gt;The forty-eight hours after the march into the Rhineland were the most nerve-racking in my life. If the French had then marched into the Rhineland we would have had to withdraw with our tails between our legs, for the military resources at our disposal would have been wholly inadequate for even a moderate resistance.[26]",0,1390784239,null,0,false,0,ceznt3q,t3_1w6sz0,t1_ceznt3q,t1_ceznbag,null,1432120975,7,false,INGLIN,t5_2v1ve,7

If you think you'll be able to handle everything, then cool, go for it, but could make things a bit harder as you'll be taking in a lot of new information. I'd almost suggest having some lessons in a car before doing your CBT, as then you will get some tuition on what to do on the roads. The CBT should teach you that anyway, but having a guy next to you telling you what to do while you're learning is bound to be better than having to remember or figure it out yourself on a 125 with L plates.

It's a good idea to rent or buy a 125 for a few months to get used to the bike controls and what to do on the road, seeing you don't have much prior experience. I was the same and it took me a while to get used some concepts I'd never really had to think about before, like doing different things with my hands and feet. If you can motivate yourself to get out as often as you can, though do be careful in colder weather, go round some quiet roads and get used to cornering and general control, then build up to getting out into traffic, you should be good. I spent a few weeks just tootling round some roads near me at night when it was quiet, which helped as I didn't have to worry about other cars so much.

Find a school that'll do CBT and further lessons on larger bikes if you intend to do your A2, so you can get extra tuition on a bigger bike before your test. Ring them up and ask them about what training the provide for A2 and hopefully they'll help you understand what you'll need to do. I found the bigger bike I took my A license on was easier to deal with than a 125 when you got the hang of it, so having a few days riding on a bigger bike with an instructor before your tests will make things much easier.

&gt;HM Revenue and Customs [HMRC] says it will sue US-based services supplier EDS unless the supplier steps up compensation payments for failures in its IT support for tax credits, which led to tens of millions of pounds in incorrect payments to claimants.

&gt;. . .

&gt;EDS agreed to compensate HMRC over tax credits by paying £71.25m with £26.5m of this contingent on EDS winning new UK government contracts.

&gt;By the end of 2006 EDS had paid less than £250,000 of the £26.5m – and at that rate it would have taken more than 100 years to pay off the full amount.

**[Later news](http://ukcampaign4change.com/2011/11/16/what-exactly-is-hmrc-paying-capgemini-billions-for/)**

&gt;What was little noticed was that auditors were unable to get a breakdown of what HMRC is paying its “Aspire” systems suppliers Capgemini and Fujitsu for online filing.

**[Recent'ish news](http://blogs.computerworlduk.com/the-tony-collins-blog/2013/08/has-two-decades-of-outsourcing-cut-costs-at-hmrc/index.htm)**

&gt;If HMRC’s experience is anything to go by, outsourcing can, in the long-term, at least triple an organisation’s IT costs.

&gt;When Inland Revenue contracted out its 2,000-strong IT department to EDS, now HP, in 1994 it was the first major outsourcing deal in central government.

&gt;Costing a projected £1.03bn over 10 years the outsourcing was a success, according to the National Audit Office in a report in March 2000. The deal enabled Inland Revenue to bring about changes in tax policy to a tight timetable, said the NAO’s Inland Revenue/EDS Strategic Partnership - Award of New Work.

&gt;But costs soared for vague reasons. Something called “post-contract verification” added £203m to the £1.03bn projected cost over 10 years. A further increase of £533m was because of “workload increases including new work”. Another increase of £248m was put down to inflation.

&gt;By now the deal with HP had risen from £1.03bn to about £2bn.

Thus, with them in power, we can expect them to deregulate the free market further and get lower public spending in favour of privatisation - that's practically the only ideological point UKIP's bastardisation of ""libertarianism"" has retained from the original political philosophy.

This can, of course, be seen in **cutting company taxation and inheritance taxation**, desiring increasing class disparities, in favour of **a flat tax over a progressive tax**, for starters.

Your NHS comment is garbage, as UKIP seeks in reality to **cutback the Department of Health**, and **remove national regulation of healthcare in favour of local standards**, meaning some areas will be patchier than others.

Walker. He's only in competition with Stalteri, Chimbonda and Hutton. Chimbonda was good for a while but Walker started better and keeps getting better. 
Vertonghen. The worst thing about him is he never got to play alongside Ledley King. 
King. Captain. Legend. 
Assou-Ekotto. This is the most disappointing position to fill. There's only Y.P. Lee, Erik Edman and half a season of Rose that I can remember. I could also put Vertonghen LB and play Dawson and King. 
Carrick. My first transfer heart-ache. 
Sandro. Love the man. I also worked in his house but that's an aside. I never met him. 
Modric. Because he's Luka fucking Modric. 
Bale. Yeah. 
Keane. The Keane-Berbatov partnership was my favourite partnership. 
Berbatov. I'd say the best striker we've had in my years.

It is just factually incorrect to say we went on a spending binge, in fact we had one of the lowest deficits in the G20 until the banking crisis (and some government deficit is actually good for the economy), and there was no political alternative to bailing out the banks. Even now our spending on debt is no problem and totally manageable (3% of GDP per year) without any cuts. When will people realize the Tories are not cutting for economic reasons but ideological ones. They hate the welfare state for the poor and love it when the state gives incentives to its mates in the fracking industry, private health care industry and so on.  

What the government is doing now is shifting debt from the government, which is at a manageable level for us to pay, to households which are in debt over 400 times more than the government and with higher interest rates and are struggling to pay.

It is madness that we are not borrowing money now at such low interest rates to build infrastructure and a green economy and to put hundreds of thousands back to work. Money is cheap, unemployment high, the need to green the economy is urgent a government that believed in society and strong government would be borrowing to invest. This government does not believe in society or a strong welfare government, it only believes in giving money to the private sector which bank-rolls the party.

""Populist"" is a means rather than an end; if something is populist, it just means that they use a rhetoric of speaking in layman's terms and repeating their relationship with ""the people"" alot.

Nope. That's the real-time interest rate. /u/32Mbit asked for the APR.

What is the APR? Not sure, because I stopped calculating it when the figure reached the tens of millions of %.

Don't forget, the A in APR stands for *annual*, so to calculate it, you need to assume OP doesn't pay back his £4 for a year, and the £50 over 18 hours is a constant over a whole year on that timescale. This is why looking at the APR on Wonga loans is pointless, because the APR assumes the loan is over a year, when it's normally a week or two, and thus it totally distorts the figure.

If there's no compounding, OP would pay £24,455 interest on his £4. If there is compounding?

First of all the policy of ""family links"" is defined how? Is this same definition as ""native"". How many generations do I have to find in my family to connect myself to a local area - one, two , three? 

Are you really blind to the implications? Do you not understand where this came from and who started talking about this? 

Honestly? Truthfully ask yourself who would find it useful to argue in places like Dagenham and East London that people who are ""historically"" british should be entitled to housing. 

&gt;""The BNP’s housing policy is:

 

- Make all benefits and social housing only available to British citizens;

- Make length of residency in an area the key criterion for council house allocation;

- Preserve the ‘right to buy’ of individual tenants, but with the money from sales being used to build more council houses;

- Take all privatised social housing stock back under local democratically controlled council ownership;

- Ensure that the billions being spent on the utterly bogus asylum seeker and immigration swindles is redeployed to alleviate the appalling conditions under which many of Britain’s old people are forced to live.

- A BNP government will restore the earnings link with pensions and ensure that elderly people who have paid a lifetime of taxes and reared families should not have to sell their homes to pay for care in their old age.

Only the British National Party has the answer to the crisis in which the welfare state finds itself after years of misrule.

Funny, we don't use this basis for anything else, normally. Should we apply this logic to baseball bats? Blunt objects like baseball bats rank second behind knives when it comes to murder and serious assault in the UK (legally held guns are so low they don't even appear in the figures), and yet not a single person has any problem with the fact that literally anyone can go into a sports shop and buy a metre-long steel bat with no questions asked, no records kept, nothing.

If we were to suggest baseball bats or cricket bats were kept at a police station until you wanted to play in the park, then to be returned at the end, there would be an outcry! People would be disgusted at such a notion, despite them being so prevalent in violent crime in this country.

Yet with legally registered guns, which pose as-near-as-makes-no-difference to zero threat to you or anyone, people demand they be treated like a piece of radioactive waste.

These demands stem from fear, not reason or the facts.

&gt;but I want to hear ""why"".

Because target/practical shooting are legitimate sports, and the people taking part in those sports pose no threat to you. The concerns based around it are based on fear, rather than any actual threats arising from the sport.

&gt;Exactly how does the lawmakers' best interests differ from the publics when it comes to guns anyway?

If it will win them votes, politicians would much prefer to *look like* they're doing something constructive over actually doing something constructive. They refuse to even entertain any discussion over our current drug laws, despite how nonsensical and damaging they are, because ""looking tough"" is a big vote-winner, so they stick with it.

After Dunblane in 1997, the conclusions by the Home Office was that the sharing of information with the Police and mental health services, plus the particular constabulary actually doing their jobs right, would have prevented the incident ever happening. The report actually made a point of saying the current gun laws were perfectly adequate, and changing them would do nothing whatsoever.

But, instead of admitting the Government and the Police dropped the ball on a preventable tragedy and actually amending their policies as recommended, they decided to ban pistols and went on a big PR gig about how they were ""getting guns off the streets"", and patted themselves on the back publicly about ""doing something.

As we know, [it didn't do anything whatsoever to gun crime](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eN0pWxjTxxc/UNZrbE0PbwI/AAAAAAAAFHo/FfPFqiKroio/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2012-12-22%2Bat%2B%2BSaturday,%2BDecember%2B22,%2B9.22%2BPM.png), but that didn't stop them from trying to make it out like they've made everyone safer when they did no such thing.",0,1390791936,null,0,false,0,cezr8zg,t3_1w1kdt,t1_cezr8zg,t1_cezphv0,null,1432122670,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Brendan Rodgers is a very good coach, but he fucking hung Stevie out to dry against Villa with that setup. Too many dickheads then jumped to conclusions about Stevie and you got the feeling they were just itching to twist their knives in.

You either play Gerrard in a 3 man midfield, or you don't play him.

West Brom at home was one of those rare games where he was playing as the side CM on the right in that 1-2, and it worked a treat. It's likely a one off and we won't see it on a regular basis. So playing him at the base is the only solution, which is ok against about 12-13 teams in the league. Against teams that are likely to outplay us and play 3 in midfield, it'd probably look bad.

Bamford has impressed so much, never outshined by lukaku or piazon during reserves games. Scoring regularly in league 1 and now championship. If he finishes the season with a good goal to game ratio I think vitesse would be a better option then the championship for him. His style of play also works better for that league.

If you've got family in the area, regardless of race, they'd rather keep the family unit together or in close proximity than shuttling off one generation to another part of the country becaue there's a lack of social housing.

A first generation immigrant that now has children or grandchildren reliant on social housing who they'd like to stay in close contact with - or even ANYBODY in that situation.  They'd like their children or grandchildren to be able to stay in the area.

moffat hints at the fact that the doctor can choose his appearance, citing precedent for the 2nd doctor's regeneration in *the war games*. if they run with this, then i suppose the explanation will likely be that the doctor fancies capaldi's features (after having met him in pompeii) and took them for himself, or something along those lines, and they'll use the colin baker appearance in *arc of infinity* to retcon this idea.

It would be easy to assume from that graph(to pick an obvious example) that switzerland has a really high murder rate. Except that it actually has one of the lowest murder rates in europe and the entire world. Just of the few murders that actually happen they seem to be done by guns, because they are available. Gun ownership has not made that country more dangerous than any other country.

It also seems that this is including suicide rates, which is somewhat disengenuous. As overall suicide rate does not seem at all related to gun availability on an international scale. Even the USA, with guns practically falling out of every cupboard in comparison to europe is about middle of the pack for suicides, well behind many relatively unarmed countries.

Again, focusing on gun suicides specifically is pointless, as that only shows what people prefer to use to kill themselves, not if any more actually do try or succeed to kill themselves in that area.

To point to my earlier example again, Switzerland has an even lower rate of suicide than the USA, UK, Canada, and many of the others on your graph. So despite actually being one of the safest countries in the world to live in by many different metrics, it is rates high on your graph because the few people that actually die in that country get shot instead of stabbed. Not very insightful.

Overall murder or suicide rate does not line up very well overall with gun ownership levels.


And back to the original topic, there is still no reason to assume the UK will explode in violence by going back to how it was in 1996, joining the parts of the UK that still allow handguns. The ban did not seem to actually improve violence in the UK. Allowing handguns on the FAC is a pretty low risk idea, and certainly not reason to assume it would result in people with .44 mags strapped on their hip at the grocery store, as carrying a pistol would remain as illegal as it was in 1996.",0,1390805058,null,0,1390805441,0,cezwb50,t3_1w1kdt,t1_cezwb50,t1_cezw4tt,null,1432125068,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Also in January when the transfer window opened everyone knows a lot of clubs were going for Mata and Mata might want to leave, but still Mata didn't get a minute playtime in the whole month. Certainly it would make Mata felt insecure and wanted to leave.

Jose said Mata was in his plan, but all the things he did was to make Mata wanted to leave further. He said Hazard is ""no for sale"" but said if Mata wanted to ask for leaving ""the door is always open"". Didn't it just give the signal to other clubs and the player that Mata is sellable?

Yes Mata hadn't appeared to be fit in Jose's system and he hadn't been best in his form. But IMO Mata had given out his best and he was professional so in time he would return to his best form and get back to the first team. If we had given so much time to Torres but couldn't we give more time and chance to Mata? And even Jose didn't really put effort to make Mata stay he keeps saying how Mata would have this and that. If he really thinks Mata is in his plan then he shouldn't have let him leave and if he thinks Mata isn't really his kind of player why doesn't he be frank as Carlo did on Ozil?

Yes, players come and leave from time to time but this time I think the club had handle it very badly to let one of the best players in the world to leave, esp to United. Deal has been done and nothing we can do now and I will support Jose and the club like I have always done. But the fans think the manager and the club have done a mistake there's nothing wrong to point that out, esp he says things like this when everything can't be redone.

I'm unsure what you're asking for. This graph is gun deaths vs. gun ownership. Why would we plot gun deaths vs. car ownership or plant ownership or anything else? 

&gt; which is somewhat disengenuous ... Again, focusing on gun suicides specifically is pointless

This is a common misconception. The facts are that 90% of people don't attempt suicide twice. If they attempt the first time with a gun they are very very likely to die. Most suicides are impulsive acts, not planned and having a gun in the house is much more likely to end in death. Plenty more info (and supporting studies) here: http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/

If two neighboring countries with the same population were being compared, Country #1 had 5 gun murders and 1 stabbing, and Country #2 had 25 stabbings and 1 gun murder, country 1 would appear to be the more violent one if plotted on your graph as gun specific deaths. Never mind that the other country has many more murders overall.

That is because gun murders do not matter. For instance, if Country #1 changes its gun laws and all of a sudden has only one gun murder and 5 knife murders, nothing has been achieved. The country would still be just as violent, just as many people would die, but it would be a statistical ""win"" going by that chart, because less would be gun related. The point is to look at how it affects the overall murder rate.

Like I pointed out, Switzerland being a prime example is high on that graph despite being one of the safest countries in the world by a large margin. All you have shown is method choice, not actual overall effect on society. 

Try plotting out overall murder rates vs gun ownership and see how that changes.


So why exactly is the suicide rate not super high in the USA? It iss about the same as countries like canada, norway, ireland and the UK, despite having orders of magnitude more guns and handguns. I guess UK people must just be super depressed to kill themselves enough to keep up with the americans without the benefit of guns to speed things along. Or other countries that make the UK look like a gun loving paradise, like China, Japan and South Korea, which have around 2-3 times the suicide rate of the USA.

When Canada introduced further gun laws, we did indeed see gun suicides drop. However, method substitution occurred, and shortly other methods of suicide filled the gap. Canada's suicide rate did not overall change for the better we just started hanging ourselves instead of blowing our brains out(those two methods are actually pretty close in terms of effectiveness too, btw).

Sure it is linearly grouped. It is also meaningless, as I showed you with the example I gave above of switzerland. That graph does not actually show that a country becomes more dangerous as it has more guns, it just shows how(not how many) people die.
It also includes suicides to further inflate the numbers.

Another fairly specific example to show what I am talking about. Using combined gun suicide and homicide rates puts the USA at the top of the graph and Japan at the bottom.

However, the overall Suicide rate alone in Japan(21.7 per 100k) outright dwarfs both the USA's suicide rate (12.0) and murder rate(4.7) combined(total of 16.7 per 100k commit suicide or are murdered in the USA). The USA's murder rate could even be twice what it is currently and that would still hold true.

true,ianrush88,null,null,"Good addition to the OP's excellent work.

The OP makes a good explanation of why we used a 1-2 midfield of G-LH against Stoke with Allen out injured, rather than L-GH or a deeper double pivot of Lucas-Gerrard. Because Rodgers values pressing and saw how effective we were when we were able to mount a coordinated press high up the pitch.

I think he probably made the right decision for that match. I thought Gerrard's performance was uneven but for most of the first half our pressing stifled Stoke and we looked solid. (Then Toure forgets that all you have to do with crouch is stay tight and nudge him as he heads the ball and things start to go downhill).

So probably the stoke formation was making the best of what we had at the time. My question is what happens if all 4 CMs are available. We've established that Gerrard doesn't suit the high energy requirements of the pressing 2, and that some parts of his game suit the single pivot position. But I don't agree that overall we'd be a better team with Gerrard in this position rather than Lucas.

If we look at the performances of the L-AH midfield starting from Gerrard getting injured against west ham through to Allen getting injued against chelsea we weren't short of speed, precision and variety in our attacking play. If there was a weakness maybe it was that the two top teams opened us up through the middle at times and we werent compact enough while leading. In my opinion the last thing the midfield needed was more ambitious passing at the expense of defensive solidity, which is what switching Gerrard for Lucas brings.

Even considering Gerrard's deficiencies defensively, I'm not convinced he's an improvement on the ball either. Theoretically yes he has a much better passing range than Lucas and the quality on the ball to play himself out of tight situations. On the other hand Lucas has better and quicker decision making and a more reliable first touch. When did you last see Lucas caught in possession? It doesn't happen because he knows where the ball is going before he receives it and plays it simple. There's no reason in theory why Gerrard can't also do this, but always his first thought is the amibitious pass and if that's not on he can play himself into trouble. In the later phases of the stoke game every time Gerrard got the ball the stoke players would retreat to their goal ready to intercept the long pass - in the end it made our attacking play more predictable.

So if we were a side that looked solid but stale going forward, and very slow (say Villas-Boas spurs) then Gerrard as a single pivot might be a good thing. Even with Lucas in that position we're quite the opposite - dynamic going forward but sometimes open defensively. Tipping that balance even further doesn't seem like a good idea.",0,1390811982,null,0,1390812187,0,cezxw9n,t3_1w7ab2,t1_cezxw9n,t1_cezc8yl,null,1432125964,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

I'm not sure when the best time to fly in from a price point of view is. Our summer holidays are late July to early September so everything is generally more expensive then, whereas the best weather tends to be June-July time. Regardless, you're going to want to fly in to Heathrow in London - it's probably going to be cheapest, and it's the nearest to Cornwall anyway.

London has awesome public transport, even if the locals start to complain if they have to wait five minutes for a train. You could get the London underground tube map, but if you've got a smartphone I'd just download one of the apps to find your way around.

Moving on to Cornwall (where I grew up and got married), public transport sucks. You'll be able to get down here easily enough - there are trains every two hours pretty much all day, or you could take a coach which will be very slow but cheaper. Once you're down here though, I would strongly recommend hiring a car. Most of the good places you'll want to go are rural and will either require a long walk from an infrequent bus or won't have a bus at all.

You don't say where abouts in the county your photographer is based - it takes about two hours to drive from one end to the other. There are probably three things people like to see and take pictures of in Cornwall - beaches, castles, and pretty villages.

For beaches, Cornwall can pretty much be divided into north and south. The north coast beaches are rugged and wild with lots of cliffs and rocks. It's where all the surfing goes on. The south coast is more tranquil and tamed, so it depends what you'd prefer. My personal recommendations would be St Ives (pretty coves), various places around the Lizard (which is the sticky out bit at the bottom around Helston), and Falmouth (picturesque). I've always lived towards the west of Cornwall though so there may well be some equally nice beaches at the other end. You will want a sunny day though, for some reason Cornish beaches look really grim when it's cloudy.

Castles-wise you can take your pick. Pendennis Castle in Falmouth is nice, but there are lots of others. I got married in a place called Tregenna Castle in St Ives - it's a hotel that looks like a castle but it does have some nice gardens with views over St Ives that you can steal.

Villages - Fowey (pronounced Foye), St Agnes, Mousehole (pronounced Mao-zull, we're weird) are all nice. One of my favourite places is the church at [St-Just-In-Roseland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Just_in_Roseland) which is a 13th century building set on a river with loads of subtropical gardens. 

Cornwall is full of bed and breakfasts, especially in the tourist places like Falmouth and St Ives. I don't know much about hostels though unfortunately.

My first thought would be that European placement would be good because the team would be at a higher profile and higher regard (we haven't gotten European placement in forever) and this means more sponsorships / money to get those better players. No team winning major cups / trophies is going to stay poor for long. And I mean there is really not much other alternative, if we breach top four we get european placement. If we stay at 5th / 6th like we have been we stay stagnant, which we don't want. 

The discrepancy between the amount of funding we have and the level at which we must perform is going to be inevitable as we improve, but the former eventually follows the latter and we want it to happen eventually, so why not now? It seems like we have an amazing new coach, who is doing better than anyone could have expected with the team, and we have an amazing prospect in barkley because he is a star player who grew up as a blue and wants to stay that way.

The opportunist did not go out to steal bikes, but happened to see one that was unlocked and thought ""hmm, I could probably steal this"" and steals it.

2) The dodgy dealer

These guys will drive down a street in the middle of the night with a flatbed truck. They scope out all the bikes in the street and cut the locks on any bike they think they can sell on quickly. They typically target bikes that are currently being sold (at shitty bike shops like cycleking) so that they have more perceived value. They won't steal bikes that are older, or cosmetically damaged. I had my bike locked to my gfs a few years ago, they cut the lock and stole hers, left mine, even though mine was a nicer bike.

3) The pro

These guys know what bikes are worth big money, and they will target anything that is more than £800. They will steal a bike in broad daylight in front of a building, even if it is locked with a D-lock to a bike rack. If you have a bike worth this much, never ever leave it outside. Keep it in the house.

Basically what I'm trying to say is that if you have a bike that's cosmetically a bit scuffed up, isn't on sale in a shitty bike shop like cycleking, and isn't worth more than £100, and is locked (even to itself) with a D-lock... it's probably not going to get stolen.",0,1390813160,null,0,1390813360,0,cezy3yi,t3_1w7qnr,t1_cezy3yi,t3_1w7qnr,null,1432126016,4,false,oxford,t5_2rc7b,4

One criticism I always had of David Moyes was that he never built a squad. We had a solid starting 11 of players that would pretty much play ever single game under Moyes (Moyes Boys) who were impervious to being dropped or rotated, no matter how bad they played. Martinez doesn't strike me as that type of manager. He's very squad orientated which has shown this year. He's not afraid to give youngsters a chance and he will rest and rotate players. One aspect of Euro Cup football I'd be looking forward to, if we qualify, would be Martinez's inclusion of the younger players in games against some of the lesser-known European teams. I think it would be a great platform to give them first team experience in games that really have an impact on the club.

Martinez is a shrewd and intelligent man. I'm sure he would make significant changes and additions to the team to match the expansion of our fixture list.

Also, I've travelled to Europe to watch Everton beat teams and I want to do it again. We shall not be moved.",0,1390813850,null,0,false,0,cezy81w,t3_1w9m7m,t1_cezy81w,t3_1w9m7m,null,1432126072,2,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,2

I'll answer as many points as I can, but this is all IMO.

&gt;Fly in at a fairly low cost time. Actual season is less important.

Your best bet is to look at the sites of the airlines you want to fly with and see when they are cheaper. If they don't have next year's prices this years should have roughly the same fluctuation.

October though is likely to be a good bet as the school holidays will have finished and you will be flying before Christmas.

If you want to get a good idea of the school holiday dates here, look at the British Airways website - they base a lot of their ticket cost on school holiday dates.

&gt; Hang out at the beach. Not necessarily swim, but chill by the ocean since we're from the Mid-West ;)

In October you will likely be cold and/or rained out of this idea most of the time.

Sorry to burst your bubble, but the seaside in the UK was never that great.

&gt;Eat really good food

Plenty of that in the UK! Try and have an Indian and a full Sunday Lunch

&gt;Drink really good wine/beer
You can get excellent French wines here, as well as very good ones from Australia and Chile and California etc. Beer wise, Belgian stuff is reputed to be good. (I don't drink so I'm basing this response on what my parents have told me)

&gt;Which airport should we fly into?
You're probably going to be stuck with Heathrow or possibly Gatwick, so London area.

&gt;What modes of mass-transportation are available? 

Depends how much you want to spend and where you want to go. Bus services are fairly cheap but they take a while to get to places. The railways are more expensive and only go to the larger towns/cities but are normally faster and are arguably more comfortable. 

London-wise you have the Transport for London (TfL) system that covers buses and the London Underground. The buses are cheap and go pretty much everywhere, whereas the tube (underground) is more expensive but is faster and goes to a lot of places as well.

&gt;Are there resources for us to get to know the systems before we arrive? 

For London, have a look around [here](http://www.tfl.gov.uk/). For intercity travel, look [here](http://www.nationalexpress.com/home.aspx) for coaches and [here](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/) for trains. The trains link I have provided is the national network page so covers all train operators but the coach link is just one of many operators so have a look for other coach providers as well.

&gt;Is there a particular map that you would recommend we print out and hang on our wall for a few months before we go to get the hang of the city?

If you look [here (PDF)](http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/standard-tube-map.pdf) This is a map of the London Underground which I would recommend.

Otherwise, just have fun and congratulations on your engagement!
