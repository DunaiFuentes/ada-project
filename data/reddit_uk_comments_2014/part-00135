Personally, I think go for it. But I really highly recommend building up your profile by setting up a blog. Customise it, setup a domain and then blog your experience. What you think of the procceses, what have you learnt, try and showcase this.


Make all your contributions/learnings open source on Github to build up your profile, do not expect a job or a chance at the end of it. Just make it a chance, an experience.

 Making everything open source will stand out a lot on your resumé/CV. This is so that developers/recruiters are able to look at your code style, how you're using git. Are the commit messages correct? That kind of thing, examples of real world applications and features can look good because these will be the features your might need to write daily.

Can't help but have the reaction: Well, to be honest that's what you should have been doing for years. SOme might claim it's rhetoric, but Christian folks are able to use the bible to be against mixed-race marriage. Given it's the same justification, highlighting it is always fun.

By the by:

&gt; Children at **state funded** Church of England schools must be taught to “revere” and “honour” gay and lesbian people...

Always worth making that point.

Something else to note:

&gt; But it adds that church schools already have teachers who live with same-sex partners and that pupils will have gay friends and parents.

Given various religious exemptions from the Equality Act 2010, those church schools still have the legal right to not-employ/sack those teachers if they so wish. Trebles all around!

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"I think you should really argue the points I made rather than ghost ones you seem to want to argue with people who defend Muslims. 

&gt;Your problem is that you are defining Islam as the quran.

Actually my first comment was this:

&gt;&gt;A good example is his inability to separate hadith from Quran, or different Madhabs from the idea of ""shariah law""

As you can see, I'm not saying the Quran is Islam. I'm actually arguing that Hitchens fails to understand or explore the nuance when it comes to the idea of ""Shariah law"" by conflating at least four schools of theology - Madhabs- into a monolithic entity. 

which makes this criticism:

&gt;Aren't you doing that? You ignore the religious views of most muslims, the ""diversity"", and insist that your view alone is the one true valid view.

Redundant because my criticism is very different. Which is why you don't really understand what I mean when I say this: 

&gt;&gt;No its not. If you're a critic the responsibility is youra to know what are you are criticising. I criticise Marx because I've read Marx. My criticism is legitmate becuase I have read Marx.

Which is why you respond with this:

&gt;""Marx"" (one man's political views) isn't comparable to Islam (an entire religion practised by billions of people). The comparison is false.

The comparison is an apt one because I'm comparing the role of CRITIC not the ideology itself.  You've not understood the way the metaphor is constructed.  The metaphor isn't comparing Islam to Marx, it's comparing the artefact of ""Criticism"". Thus the thing we are comparing is ""criticism"" not ""Islam versus Marx""

The point I'm making is that the legitimacy of criticism should be connected to the understanding of a thing and a presentation of it's nature, structure, scope, depth, context and language.

If I decide to critique Marx, but I don't know the difference between Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft, then I'm not really providing an analysis. I'm just talking. 

A good example is the treatment of Shia and Sunni under Hitchens, who fails to go beyond a surface analysis that it's a conflict solely understood in succession of the Prophet's role as leader. It's not, it's also rooted in the socio-political movements of the last 1400 years - a good example being the rise of Safavid Iran which is the most important influence on current Shi'ism. Even then, he completely fails to understand that modern Shi'ism in Iran in 1979 in Iran actually comes from a completely new tradition within Shia Islam which overturned centuries of quietism and disinterest from the political realm from the clerical establishment. Let's not go into the differences between Iraqi or Lebanese based Shi'ism versus Iran or even South Asia. 

So Hitchens role as ""critic"" is severely limited in usefulness or depth.

My last point, which you fail to tackle, is that Hitchens undertook the role of public intellectual and professional writer. That puts him in a totally different category than the average person, and subsequently the average muslim. 

Hitchens, by nature of his career, his platform, his networks, and the impact of his words is cannot be classed as an average person. Thus it's a bit silly to then compare him to the average muslim person and say ""he knows better"". It's meaningless. 

In fact, it is more plausible to argue that a public intellectual has more of a moral responsibility to present criticism with depth and analysis because of those advantages that he or she holds. 

Edit: for those of you who don't know , Hitch made his name taking on Pinochet and the CIA backed anti-communism operations in Latin America. I've been reading him for a very long time, before he became famous as one of the ""four horsemen"". It's instructive to read his earlier work and his later work.

So you admit that what it originally said ""Abolishing laws to protect your human rights"" is wrong? If one set of laws are simply being replaced by a different set, that's hardly ""abolishing"" the laws, is it?

Britain has a long history of human rights laws long before the ECHR. I fail to see why a british bill of rights would protect from overreach any less than the ECHR would.

Now here's a question for you and your pals - 

Is that interpretation wrong. If so , then why?

I know its fashionable amongst the reddit ""anti=pc"" crowd to whine about ""looking for offence"" when anyone points out anything like this.

But there is offence. There is abuse - why is the reporting of abuse wrong? Why is the identification of abuse wrong? 

Why do you take agency from the person who causes the offence or the abuse and then pin it on the person who identifies it? 

Prove me wrong , tell me it's more morally acceptable to complain about the person who causes harm than the person who reports it.

Certainly there seems to be some raw element there when working with youth players, and the results on the field have (in all honesty) been pretty good for an untested premier league manager taking his first job.

The problem is he couldn't handle the pressure and the media frenzy. For every potentially good thing he did, someone can point to a ""clown episode."" He introduced Bentaleb which many of us regarded early on as an ""ok"" move. Then he went on to pick the poor bastard time and time again despite him getting ""schooled"" by experienced teams. He didn't play rumours of his job going to someone else with a cool and calm comeback, or brush them off as non-stories. He took the bait, he actually didn't just take the bait, he invented more and played up to it.

My honest take on the guy is that he has confidence issues. I'm not even joking. I think the bravado, blame game, acting up, acting like a smartass are all covers for the fact he felt in over his head. In all fairness he was in over his head, his first swimming lesson was in the deep end of the pool. The same deep end of the pool that he watched the previous guy flounder in before being pulled out barely alive.

If he wants to learn manage, he needs to head down a few leagues. He needs to build up experience, especially when it comes to dealing with pressure and journalists.

What I meant by that is that to you, Islam is some theoretical idea defined by some books like the quran or the hadiths, but to others it is the religion practised by actual muslims.  That's why you see not separating the hadiths from the quran as somehow invalidating his criticism.  Whereas, for many what most muslims actually believe is exactly what Hitchens is criticising.  Imagine if all christians stopped believing in creationism and accepted evolution.  Would it make sense for a critic to have to criticise genesis in order to be taken seriously as a critic?  You keep side stepping this issue or misrepresenting it, even though this is the main point I made and keep making.

It's why the comparison with Marx isn't valid.  Criticism of the works of Marx is going to be different to that for a religion.  Because, here, **Marx is given one single definition**, whereas with religion, **it can have multiple definitions**.  I have given you ample opportunities to realise this and directly asked you what your definition of Islam is.  You have continually failed to do so.  No debate can continue unless you're willing to define the basic terms used.  This isn't complicated at all.  It's as I said earlier, you are playing semantics.

**So, I ask you again, what is Islam?  Is it the contents of a book or books or is it the actual religious practises of the adherents of that religion?**

&gt;Hitchens, by nature of his career, his platform, his networks, and the impact of his words is cannot be classed as an average person. Thus it's a bit silly to then compare him to the average muslim person and say ""he knows better"". It's meaningless.

You completely misunderstand yet again even though I've provided very simple and clear explanations.  I was showing that Hitchens criticisms are relevant to most muslims, because that's what they actually believe!  That is islam from one definition.  Try reading more slowly this time.

They might be able to offer you something better. Even their online CS agents have the power to make such offers :). But don't jump to another network without seeing their signal coverage in places like your house first. Go into a shop like WHSmith, and just buy every networks SIM to give it a shot. Avoid duplicating using MVNO's as they piggy back on others networks so won't prove anything. Check Three, O2/GG/Tesco/Lycra, EE/Tmo/Orange.

I've had EE for a couple of years. Business support is a whole new kind of customer service hell, can't speak for the consumer side. They're unhelpful, often quite rude, and incompetent. This is just my experience however.

Signal varies. I find it quite strong in town centers. But it's near unusable while on a train (compared to O2). I guess this could have something to do with the frequency they operate at. And I have a lot of issues with their data signal when in heavily crowded places like London train terminals.

The consumer plans do have very nice roaming boltons though which often makes the necessity to buy a foreign SIM untenable.

No, not as far as geysers and volcanoes go. 

However, most of our countryside is beautiful. Obviously due to the size of the Uk huge swathes of untamed land are pretty rare. We do have National Parks, although the terminology here is a little different; they're not managed/owned by the government and they do include settlements. There are [13 in total.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_parks_of_England_and_Wales)
Some famous ones are the [Lake District](http://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/visiting/placestogo/exploreullswater/ullswaterinformationcentre/hd_view-from-gowbarrow-aug.jpg), the [Peak District](http://fc02.deviantart.net/images3/i/2004/171/0/e/Peak_district_4_mountain_range.jpg) and [Snowdonia](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/North_snowdonia_panorama.jpg), and they are run by their own authorities. 

However we've plenty of rural areas that are not national parks that are still beautiful. Some are designated as Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and are protected to some degree. The [Shropshire Hills](http://www.shropshirehillsaonb.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Titterstone-looking-towards-Ludlow-by-Claire-Carter-low-res3.jpg) and the [North Devon Coast](http://www.northdevon-aonb.org.uk/pagegallery/48_View%20from%20Hartland%20Quay%20East%20(Medium).jpg ) are a couple of random examples of the 33 AONB.

Also the [Scottish Highlands](http://www.inverglenphotography.com/imgs/home/lrg_21596_175740852050a368153d538.jpg) are beautiful. It might not look like much compared to Yellowstone but I love it all anyway.

José Mourinho began the process of reshaping his Chelsea squad for next season when David Luiz agreed terms with Barcelona yesterday over a move likely to be worth almost £30 million after the World Cup finals.  
  
There is a desire from both clubs and the player for the deal to happen, but it is likely to be subject to the approval of the next coach at the Catalan club. Gerardo Martino could depart Barcelona, to be replaced by Luis Enrique, even if he lifts the Spanish title by beating Atlético Madrid in a winner-takes-all match on Sunday.  
  
Mourinho is not short of targets for the proceeds of the Luiz sale. It was reported last night that the club had agreed a £32 million deal with Atlético Madrid for Diego Costa, their striker. Chelsea had previously been linked with Mario Mandzukic, of Bayern Munich.  
  
Luiz, who has three years left on his contract, will generate Chelsea a profit on the player who they signed for an initial £17 million, rising to £21.2 million, as part of a deal that also involved Nemanja Matic moving to Benfica in 2011. Luiz did not rule out taking up interest from Paris Saint-Germain, when asked on Sunday, but he would prefer to move to Spain. He is already in Brazil for the World Cup finals in his home country. “We’ll see, you never know,” Luiz said when asked about PSG.  
  
Brazil have forbidden their players from entering transfer negotiations once their squad has met up on May 26, leaving little time for Barcelona to push through a deal for Luiz. Chelsea have twice rejected an approach from Barcelona for Luiz, arguing that they did not want to sell to a European rival, but Mourinho has never considered him a regular in his back four and economic realities have hit home.  
  
Chelsea have already changed their transfer policy to adapt to Uefa’s Financial Fair Play rules. In January, they sold Juan Mata and Kevin de Bruyne for a total of £55 million, which allowed them to buy Matic, Kurt Zouma, from Saint-Étienne, and Mohamed Salah, from Basle, and still make a profit.  
  
This time, Chelsea are looking to raise cash to bring in a left back — Alberto Moreno, of Seville, is favoured — a centre back and a striker. Chelsea are monitoring José Callejón, the Napoli winger who came through the ranks at Real Madrid.  
  
Barcelona consider Luiz a replacement for Carles Puyol, who is leaving the club this summer, and hope to recoup some of the outlay from selling Alexandre Song, the former Arsenal midfielder. Andoni Zubizarreta, the Barcelona sporting director, met Enrique last week and the expectation is that the Celta Vigo coach will return to his former club.  
  
Liverpool are favourites to sign Adam Lallana after making an offer for the Southampton midfielder, who came through the club’s academy after being spotted playing for Bournemouth’s centre of excellence. Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur had also registered an interest in the player, who made his England debut against Chile in November. He was named in the PFA Premier League team of the year, along with Luke Shaw, who seems destined for Manchester United. Shaw will cost United a £27 million transfer fee and is expected to be offered a weekly wage of £100,000 over five years.  
  
The future of his manager remains uncertain. Southampton have offered Mauricio Pochettino a new deal but he has concerns about the club’s spending and future ownership.

&gt;Initially, the entire blame for the incident was laid on the fans of Liverpool FC. On 30 May official [UEFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA) observer Gunter Schneider said, ""Only the English fans were responsible. Of that there is no doubt."" UEFA, the organiser of the event, the owners of Heysel Stadium and the Belgian police were investigated for culpability. After an 18-month investigation, the dossier of top Belgian judge Marina Coppieters was finally published. It concluded that blame should not rest solely with the English fans, and that some culpability lay with the police and authorities. Several top officials were incriminated by some of the dossier’s findings, including police captain Johan Mahieu, who had been in charge of security on 29 May 1985 and was now charged with involuntary manslaughter.

But when has he been played consistently? Never, Torres has been used time and time again.

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"I don't think my reading is the issue. The problem is you want to have an argument about two things you seem to know nothing about. One is Islam and the other is the role of the public intellectual. 

You seem to deliberately understand the point - because I'm guessing you have more experience with people who don't read philosophy or widely in terms of social science. 

Let's take this :

&gt;What I meant by that is that to you, Islam is some theoretical idea defined by some books like the quran or the hadiths, but to others it is the religion practised by actual muslims. That's why you see not separating the hadiths from the quran as somehow invalidating his criticism. Whereas, for many what most muslims actually believe is exactly what Hitchens is criticising. 

You're making two claims there:

a) that I have defined Islam as just the Quran and Hadith, and have not understood ""but to others it is the religion practised by actual muslims.""

I'll get to the whole legitimacy of ""but to others it is the religion practised by actual muslims."" In a minute. 

But at no point have I said that Islam is X, what I have said is that Hitchens's understanding of Islam is flawed because of it's lack of nuance and complexity. 

&gt; Imagine if all christians stopped believing in creationism and accepted evolution. Would it make sense for a critic to have to criticise genesis in order to be taken seriously as a critic? 

But that's exactly what Hitchens does. South Asian Islam , sufi, shia , Hanafi, Zaidi and all the other flavours of Islam are treated exactly the same. 

Let's take the role of women in Islam, in many of works on Islam he doesn't even mention the role of Fatima ( Mohammad's daugher)  and Zainab (his grand daughter) in Shi'ism. So he's written all this stuff on Islam and what it means to women in Iran, but has very little on the role that Fatima and Zainab play in religious lives of Muslims and the symbology employed by both critics of Iran and supporters around these women.

That Islam is the lived Islam of 150 million shia muslims around the world and is totally diverse from the other muslim traditions in many ways. BUT because of the influence and cross pollination of ideas in South Asia you get a lot of the symbology of Fatima crossing into the lived experience of Muslims in India. 

This world doesn't really exist in Hitchen's interrogation of Islam. He seems to be unaware of the great sufi mystical traditions, in both Africa and Asia that underpin LIVED understanding of what Islam is. 

Which is where you claim b) that 

&gt;..Whereas, for many what most muslims actually believe is exactly what Hitchens is criticising... 

and

&gt; I was showing that Hitchens criticisms are relevant to most muslims, because that's what they actually believe! 

But are they? Does Hitchen's interpretation have anything to do with the great Ashura procession in Tehran? Does it understand the great Sufi poetry read on the day of the Prophet's birthday. Does it explain why Rumi's poetry is  part of the religious discussions in Turkey. Or why during the sermons on Friday, people read Iqbal's  work? 

No it doesn't , because he assumes that Islam is an experience that is only guided by those strict criteria that he observes. It has nothing to do with how Islam's diverse nature is lived by Muslims.. but what he interprets it as. 

Which brings me back to the point that to criticise a thing one should know a thing, and he doesn't know the thing. 

So this point:

&gt; Criticism of the works of Marx is going to be different to that for a religion.

But it's only going to be criticism if I can identify what Marx is and form a framework valid enough to form criticism. This is the same PROCESS as criticising anything else. One needs a frame of reference. A structure where claims can be tested. 

Even if Islam is a religion and it is complex, nuanced and very diverse. You need to understand HOW the frames of reference work to be able to differentiate what those complexities are. 

The point I have been making is that Hitchens lacked so much in his understanding that those frames of reference aren't really good enough to be considered ""criticism"" , they were polemics about what HE thought was Islam and nothing more with little weight beyond opinion. 

The issue is that as a public intellectual his responsibility is to either admit he didn't know enough , or actually tackle the knowledge deficit. However, what he did do was build a platform of misunderstanding from which others have been attacking Muslims ever since.

Rodgers did an incredible job turning us from a mid-table team to a top 2 attack in the league (with much less fashionable players than City have). If we had held on to win the title, Rodgers would have deserved the awards, bar none.

true,pajammin,null,null,"i enjoyed it a lot. the way i see it, the first series is about how you want to be remembered when you die. you can see that with the mirror impressions and the eulogies, apart from the obvious link to the romantics that they keep portraying.

i think if the first season was coogan's, this is brydon's though. in the same way that i think the first season reflecting coogan's northern brooding nature, i think brydon's sunny disposition is reflected by going to italy (and lets not forget that its him who invites steve in this season).

i thought the last couple of scenes were basically lifted out of the godfather 2. there's light on rob's face like there is with michael in the finale of that film, and rob notices it and mentions it. also they are overlooking the lake with the boat in. further similarities are that they are good friends (or brothers, in the the godfather II's case) but kind of despise eachother. on top of this they do the brando impression and bring up how they can still do godfather without siciliy. 

i think if you try and loop it round to what this season's been trying to say, it's that rob perhaps is becoming less of a family man and is starting to fall into the perks of the showbusiness hedonism lifestyle - he's having sex with strangers, he gets on great with the PA, he says that he likes the simple things but he's in italy in 5 star restaurants. he's getting sucked into the world he mocked and pushed away from in the first season in the same way that godfather 2 shows michael at the beginning resisting joining 'the family'.

Sinn Fein aren't known for their short term strategy, it locks in their two party system, where they can take down Northern Ireland from the inside or simply let the DUP run it into the ground themselves, at which point Westminster could get quite miffed and reinstate direct rule, the Northern Irish public could get quite miffed and reconsider what the economic benefits of Northern Ireland are.

The [PePiPoo](http://forums.pepipoo.com/) forums may be able to help you.

My understanding is that UKPC need authority from the landowner to actually stand any chance of charging you, so if you can get the college to tell them to back down you should be fine.

Edit: 

I should point out that private companies have **no** power to fine you, ever. The council can.

They can, however, charge you if they can show that you formed a contract with them. Their argument is that by driving past a sign with the car park rules on, you have implicitly agreed to their contract. There is *plenty* of room to dispute this fact. Other than that, they can claim for damages - which in this case would almost certainly be zero. They would have to take you to court to force you to do this. There is a non-binding appeals process called POPLA outside of the legal system.

Similar companies have been taking people to (civil) court recently (ParkingEye being particularly notorious). I don't believe UKPC have ever been very litigous, though I don't keep up with these things. I don't believe any companies have been very successful - except at pissing off the magistrates for wasting their time with frivolous cases.

true,Quartzish,null,null,"He was given the job and it was his to lose... As for tactics, I can understand complaints about the high line as I am against it too, but offensively the switch to 4-4-2 using Chadli in the CM and Eriksen in space on the wings were great decisions. We don't have a dominant lone striker, so we needed to use 2. Using 2 leaves us a man down in the midfield. Eriksen's great passes and use of space would be null in a 2v3 midfield match up and look at what he has done in that role. He really broke out after that change in position. Getting defenders to not make mistakes is not a managers job. No one wants to make an errant pass or make a shit clearance, what would a manager say to a guy to prevent that from happening? ""Next time don't slip on the pitch"". 

Keeping possesion is a double edged sword. It is almost like time wasting. If your CB's and fullbacks pass it back and forth for 10 min, you are both eliminating your opponent's chances as well as your own to score a goal. This might be great if you can score goals, but if can't you are shooting yourself in the foot. 

For example, if a team scores 5% of the time and gets an average of 100 chances at possession per game, they will score 5 goals on average. If you time waste by playing keep away, they may only get 60 times in possession. This would mean an average of 3 goals per game. This is what you see as ""good"" defense. But you have to see that goal reduction as a ratio compared to the rest of the game. That also means we only get 60 vs 100 times to score, and if we only score 4% of the time instead of 6% because we are less risky with passing, we are going to lose. Good defense to me is reducing the % of times they score once in possession vs 
reducing the # of total possessions. 

So back to the double edged sword comparison, yes you concede less goals, but you also score less and possibly hurt your offensive flow(as shown by our scoring being compared with relegation teams).

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"See , you then let yourself down by posting this drivel, which I didn't have time to write a reponse. But I have now. Let's get a few things out of the way. 

&gt;You can load your words with a lot of social/economica/cultural/queer theory concepts you want. 

This is not how you debate political philosophy. I mean we were doing so well with Hobbes but we had to have this, it's a shame.  Why, because we are in the realms of debating concepts and theories. Now either you're going to debate them , or you're not. When we debate like adults we accept that all theories have a teleology and framework that can be debated and compared - not liking doesn't really factor. 


Also it's self defeating on your part. If you don't want to debate theory and philosophy - then don't use Locke or Mill as a basis for your classically liberal / ultilitarian arguments. 

There's no point arguing good old Freedom from and Freedom to in any meaningful way if your attitude to everything is ""nananana I'm not listening because you have queer arguments"". 

LAstly don't accuse people of mental gymnastcs and ""emotional arguments"" when the entire length of interaction with me has been amply demonstrated by both - one does not make comments like this 

&gt;You're the worst kind of oppressor or 

&gt;is the oppression as hard as thousand exploding suns. 

Also, I never asked for Clarkson to be sacked. My point has always been , the word nigger is offensive and people who are defending his alleged use of it are basically excusing it. Secondly, the BBC shouldn't be operating an environment where no one intervened to stop it or to remind Clarkson that it was not on. 

So let's start with this idea that I'm the oppressor. 

Firstly, I've established using peer -reviewed publication , that words can be abusive. They can be used in bullying. They can cause hurt and offence that psychologically and personally damaging. You haven't contested this. 

Thus my argument that Nigger is offensive is not that was offensive in the past - it's that it is abuse NOW, and in LIVING MEMORY. Now there are reasons it carries this and these reasons are context. Context affects how people see themselves and how they perceive identity. Here is a good start for you: 

http://dtserv2.compsy.uni-jena.de/ss2011/sozpsy_uj/41345313/content.nsf/pages/e330395d55c4adfbc125789200466f57/$file/1994%20pspb%20self%20and%20cognition.pdf

The word nigger used against me , means that that person doesn't consider me a human being, he doesn't consider me to be part of an identify that includes him and indeed is less than him. It's not just calling someone an idiot - it's actually saying ""you are born to an inferior race and are not human so I may treat you as if you have no rights"".

This book deals with the meaning of Nigger and other slurs including their effects :

http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2004-18646-000


So where is the oppression? Is it in the abuse that is being directed towards the person called a Nigger or the other way round? 

Any sane person would say that abuser is the oppressor. It's that simple.Even under the tests proposed by JS Mill and Jeremy Bentham, that of ""harm"", this abuse is causing harm. 

So let's recap - by most philosophical tests abuse is harm, We have scientific evidence that verbal abuse is harm. Therefore using the word Nigger is harmful in the general context. 

In this context, if you agree that abuse is harm then the degree to which harm is prevented by society is the debate - not whether you have an inalienable right to abuse people. 

Here's a reference: 

http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/indilr29&amp;div=16&amp;id=&amp;page=

and another:

and another: 

http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/20685022?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103759650401

So now that we've established that a) nigger is abuse and b) that that abuse can be considered oppression because of both extant and historical context, we need to consider some other concepts that your construction of society seems to ignore. 

Let us begin with the idea of legitimacy. In all your discussion you seem to operate under this assumption that ideas and morals are fixed. That our norms don't develop over time. This is a problem because the norms that you have now have to be accepted by society somehow - and that mechanism is legitimacy. 

Why is this important, because the ideas that are codified into law have to have legitmacy ie. you have to accept the body makes them can make them In your case it's a democratically elected government that codifies them. 

That government has written laws that make the human rights as decided by the EHRC as the basis for the norms of our governing society. Which in turn means that the discrimination and abuse of a person is considered wrong and morally unjustifiable. It is identified as harm. Thus it's legislated against. 

So this means, ultimately, we accept the idea of harm in speech. Our democratic government gives that legitimacy because we give our government legitimacy. This is why Socrates famously takes the hemlock - to symbolise that the decision of Athenian senate was legitimate = though he ultimately suffered as a result. 

This is also why the BBC has a duty of care to be responsible for the same standards, because it derives its legitimacy from Charter, which means it derives its legitimacy from parliament - the same place that the Government does and parliament has passed the EHRC into law. 

Thus the BBC should not be presiding over an environment that confers the abuse of anyone's rights under the EHCR. If they let bullying, physical violence, intimidation happen under their watch - they are culpable under law. The same goes for verbal abuse. 

Now you're entitled to have your opinion but you have to ask yourself -  if the legitimacy lies with parliament, and the EHR; the norms that we have accepted as a society accept that words can be abuse and bullying;  under the test of the harm principle we can prove that verbal abuse is oppression; and ultimately can lead to the dehumanisation of an entire people - then you defence of the word might be something you may want to think about.

Except that there's almost no way that could be the case. That's besides the point. For some people, a hell of a lot, perhaps even the majority, it would severely compromise their holiday entitlements. On balance, the statement is correct. For most people who read it, the statement is 100% correct. For some, the effects will only be tangential. Perhaps you're employed by a big company but your spouse is employed by a corner shop. In that case, organizing joint time off to take a vacation together might be nigh-on impossible. Or, perhaps more sinisterly, it's the beginning of a slipper slope. (And have you considered that beginning to scrap statutory entitlements might return us to the bad old days of militant unionism? If the government won't do it then (vigorous) collective bargaining will be the first and last resort for people). 

&gt;So you admit that what it originally said...

No, I admit no such thing. The way it was written was incorrect. In the poster it said that UKIP was abolishing laws in order to protect our rights. That's not what they wanted to say. They wanted to say that they will abolish laws that are protecting our human rights. The part in the square brackets was a disambiguation. 

&gt;If one set of laws are simply being replaced by a different set, that's hardly ""abolishing"" the laws, is it

Yes. It is. They have to abolish the HRA to replace it with a British Bill of Rights. The British Bill of Rights can in no way, as a matter of our constitution, be as far reaching or as entrenched. A BBoR will not be equivalent to the HRA; some protections are being abolished. Exactly what they said in the poster.

&gt;Britain has a long history of human rights laws long before the ECHR

That as it may be, our record in recent years has been one of the worst amongst Western European nations. The ECHR has been one of the main drivers of protecting the rights we enjoy. Withdrawal from that leaves us at the whim of our parliament. Our parliament, being sovereign, can do what it wants. Unless it entrenches rights, the only gurantee on our rights is that they respect them. Time and time again they've shown that they don't. 

The only way that the BBoR can be a functional equivalent (really this would make it more robust but hey) of the HRA would be a complete constitutional overhaul and a written constitution. 

Let me boil that down for you: At the moment, overreach is prevented by the HRA and ECHR. In order to remove that prevention, the UK must withdraw from the ECHR and, thus, the EU. The British Government do not want to do that as the former would be an international cluster fuck and the latter, on their analysis, an economic disaster (I gather you would disagree). Outwith the ECHR's jurisdiction, they only thing preventing overreach is a motion scrapping the bill. Without entrenchment, which the international treaties represent, the rights are barely worth the paper they're written on.

My point is not to bash on people for using ISAs, everyone uses the system that is there. But we have a failure of ideology. People can't know with any clarity what is ethical and what isn't.

No Cahill: I thought Terry's resurgence was more notable than Cahill's form this season and Terry is the captain, therefore I attributed the success of the back four to Terry.

Why Matic: I picked Matic over Azpi (he was the obvious other choice) because I felt that even though Azpi played so well at LB and unseated Cole, he didn't offer as much elsewhere on the pitch and didn't break into the team until later (kind of like Matic). Meanwhile, we were struggling to asset ourselves in games and found ourselves leaking goals late in the first half of the season. Matic came in and along with Jose's new tactics, completely resolved those issue by being essentially a 3rd CB *and* a midfielder. Matic provided so much cover for the back four and you could find him all over place recovering the ball. On top of that, he still found a way to be one of our most important assisting players since his arrival. I felt that given Matic just brought more to the table in a very tangible way not just defensively, but in retaining possession in the midfield, *AND* providing creation in the attacking phase.

true,Denswend,null,null,"&gt;Now either you're going to debate them , or you're not. When we debate like adults we accept that all theories have a teleology and framework that can be debated and compared - not liking doesn't really factor.

I agree. When you say that they can be debated then you agree with the notion of debate taking place. I stand against the fact that using a racial slur (an insult meant to be offensive) is equivalent of  "" Abuse them with all the words that you now they hate. Remind them of all their inadequacies and failures, in detail. Tell them they are worthless and you're going to beat them round the head. Do that for hours and hours, loud as you can.""

If we're going to debate this like adults, then you have to take my stance in consideration. Prove to me that usage of a racial slur, not directed towards anyone, is the same as instant (not distant mind you, lest we fall once again on the slippery slope) dehumanization of entire people which would instantly result in credible oppression. Prove to me that *one man recited an old nursery rhyme, mumbled the evil and oppressive word* will lead into every white person killing and raping the minorities. Furthermore, prove to me that crimalizing a word when said by a member of a certain word will not lead to more oppression. We talk then.

&gt;LAstly don't accuse people of mental gymnastcs and ""emotional arguments"" when the entire length of interaction with me has been amply demonstrated by both - one does not make comments like this

You opened a discussion with an emotionally charged (don't make me copy paste it again) argument of ""When you"". I've made two comments of you being the worst kind of oppressor (emotionally charged?) and thousand exploding suns is can hardly compete with yours. And you even pull out Niemoller. I accuse you of emotional arguments because you've overdid yourself on them.

&gt;Also, I never asked for Clarkson to be sacked. 

You support those who would have him sacked. Not only that, but you actively defend him. See below

&gt;My point has always been , the word nigger is offensive and people who are defending his alleged use of it are basically excusing it. 

I support Clarkson, so I'm defending him, and by proxy I'm excusing the usage of an offensive word. But then you support those who would have him sacked, are you then not guilty of excusing them?

&gt;Firstly, I've established using peer -reviewed publication , that words can be abusive. They can be used in bullying. They can cause hurt and offence that psychologically and personally damaging. You haven't contested this.

I agree. Words can certainly be abusive. They can also be offensive. 

&gt;Thus my argument that Nigger is offensive is not that was offensive in the past - it's that it is abuse NOW, and in LIVING MEMORY. Now there are reasons it carries this and these reasons are context.

The word nigger will *always* carry an offensive contexts (regardless of when it's used). I've never said that it won't. 

&gt;The word nigger used against me , means that that person doesn't consider me a human being, he doesn't consider me to be part of an identify that includes him and indeed is less than him. It's not just calling someone an idiot - it's actually saying ""you are born to an inferior race and are not human so I may treat you as if you have no rights"".

The word nigger is not used against you, it's not used against anyone.  Furthermore, if you can prove that Clarkson does not consider you a human being (which you, from the *textual context* of him saying that, **can't**) , then I agree that he may be bad person - but that is an opinion which he alone must have on his conscience, it is not for society to punish thoughts. If he, however, abuses you physically or mentally (saying nigger to your face for everytime he sees you) in a manner which would bring you to your mental breaking point (certified by proffesional psychologists, of course), then it's another story. 


&gt;nigger is abuse
Yes
&gt;abuse can be considered oppression
Yes. But not in this instance. *One man mumbling something reminiscent of nigger*. Your very argument resides on your ability to load a word divorced from its textual context to be the equivalent of ""the worst things said in an eternity, lakes of fire, and other bad stuff"" (I really don't want to c/p it for the second time) You can load it with context, I agree. You might even be considered specially insulted by it. But you do not have the right to make it extrea abuse . One word will never be equivalent of verbal abuse that can be done under a prolonged period of time (""Do that for hours and hours, loud as you can."") with mass number of words (""Remind them of all their inadequacies and failures, in detail.""). You might cite every unbiased citation there is to prove that people are insulted when you use insults against them, and some might even consider a specific form of insult extra hard, but it will still not be equal to the verbal abuse I outlined above. If we take the matter further, and step away from victim complex of the black race in general, we might find that some mentally unstable people might shatter under a specific insult. Would you then prohibit that insult too.

&gt;In all your discussion you seem to operate under this assumption that ideas and morals are fixed. 

Yes and no. Certain degree of fixation of morality is necessary. 

This is a problem because the norms that you have now have to be accepted by society somehow - and that mechanism is legitimacy.

No. If you put up a law that says that killing black men should be fined, and not penalized with jail time, and the law sticks for the next hundred years, would the legitimacy of the change of social norm be moral? 

&gt;That government has written laws that make the human rights as decided by the EHRC as the basis for the norms of our governing society. Which in turn means that the discrimination and abuse of a person is considered wrong and morally unjustifiable. It is identified as harm. Thus it's legislated against.


Furthermore, I denounce your claim that single usage of the word divorced from its textual context (a simple word : ""Nigger."" and nothing more) is verbal abuse of the highest degree. 

EHRC guarantees equality under law. If a black person says nigger (regardless of his justification) and does not get penalized, but a white person says nigger, but gets penalized, you endager equality under law. How does it go again, contravene to the whole spirit of EHRc?


Now you're entitled to have your opinion but you have to ask yourself - if the legitimacy lies with parliament, and the EHR; the norms that we have accepted as a society accept that equality under law is the very foundation of our societies; under the test of the legal inequality principle we can prove that an insult coming from a member of specific group is considered oppression, therefore it is legislated against to limit the rights of this specific group ; and ultimately can lead to the abolishment of the rights of an entire people and finally lead to the dehumanisation of an entire people - then you defence of the word might be something you may want to think about.



EDIT : I'm just going to stop here. Your tactics bore me to death. Your systematic ignoring of troubling parts and selective blindness and amnesia are annoying. We'll achieve no consensus here, I think we can both agree on that. I'll just give you some food for thought :
You might be fairly educated, but if your tactics are this childish you won't persuade a goldfish, let alone someone intelligent. So let me give you some partially empirically proven, partially theoretically valid observation - when prohibition against certain something when aversion to that certain something isn't quite innate yet occurs, people will react to it. They'll react hard to counter prohibition, and when this prohibition stops the zeal of people won't dissapear. This is why rights of minorities went from - ""P-p-lease stop this slavery thing, it's kinda evil"" to ""Stop beating us like we're dogs"" to finally ""You using these words is bad because your people were bad and you're still bad and me using that is empowering because I falsely appeal to authority and can't quite tell you why a word is essentially holocaust"". It can go left, it can go right. When it goes right, it goes bloody. I might have enough tolerance for you, but an average Briton won't. He'll ask himself ""Why is when black people say nigger empowering but when I use it I'm jailed""? He'll take a look at his favourite show and wonder what this whole witchhunt was about. The very fact that you are downvoted, when I would be blasted into downvote hell for opinions contrary to yours, proves this. Then he'll ask himself ""Why are these people here? In our country, telling us what not to say and what not to think because they **feel** it dehumanizes them?"". He'll ask himself ""Okay, their methods might be crude, but is their presence [beneficial to us](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9477.2007.00176.x/abstract)?"". Then he'll take a closer look at crime statistics. He'll take a closer look at multi cultural and multi ethnic neighbourhoods. He might even take a closer look at the country they came from. And he might (or his loved one) be hurt by one of those ""dehumanized"" minority.

Then comes anger. Then comes desire for justice. And then it start to be all about bloodshed. I've seen it happen. British conquered the most of the world, they gave birth to most ferocious of bloodthirsty soldiers, they were a superforce with their military power, they gave birth to the only superforce currently existing. All it takes is for one man too many to piss at their barbaric system of oppression (or if you want to be less PC, their culture) which ended slavery, ended race discrimination (legal one, the current Chinese colonization of Africa and genocide against whites in South Africa are still ongoing there),  and gave you everything that you have.

I don't know what games you have been watching but having to endure Dawsons long hoof to ade isn't an effective means to play out the back. Chadli did a great job of being comfortable on the ball and being mobile enough to work it up to the likes of Erikson, Ade, Paulinho and other offensive playmakers. He wasn't expected to be a goal threat from that position and he did a much better job there than most of midfield all year. At the start we kept trying to force it up a sideline and you would consistently see the winger fullback and 2 CM's within 20 feet. Using Chadli for a few games and Sandro in the last game really helped develop play from the center to then be played out wide so the players had space. 

As for Ade yes he is great goal threat but inconsistant to be relied on. He looks much more in his element with a second striker taking away another CB. Also that season he had double digit goals and assists he had the likes of Bale Modric and VdV feeding him and controlling the game. No need to be condescending... everyone has different opinions on how well they think players will do in different situations. 

I understand holding possession is good for retaining a lead, but you are also assuming we score that 1 to make it 1-0. We had what 4 early games with a 1-0 from a late penalty and all but 1 were questionable at best. We lucked out at the start of the season. If the other team scored first we were helpless on offense cause we still played the possession game. Look at Norwich, Arsenal, West Ham, Newcastle all games where we conceded first and couldn't do shit about it.

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"Really, is this the best you can come up with? No actual references,  no interrogation on Mill or Bentham. No understanding of the harm principle. No actual journal articles. I'm disappointed. 

Listen up, equality under the law is covered by the harm principle. That's why I gave you those articles to read. You know, the ones that actually discuss the use of the word versus freedom of speech. Equality under the law means a balance of harms. Thus the harm caused by oppression is balanced against the harm caused by preventing free speech - it's covered in the EHRC rulings and it's very well covered by people like Rawls. 

If you're going to bandy about liberal principles please understand them. You have no idea what the founding principles of our society are because you do not understand the parameter and limits of liberal thought ( and I mean liberal as we use it not as per the US).

And you don't seem to understand the wider social science point about norms and keep conflating it with the idea of ""inalienable rights"". The concept of norms just describes the process of accepting ""inalienable rights"" as part of our society.

This point.. 

&gt;the norms that we have accepted as a society accept that equality under law is the very foundation of our societies; under the test of the legal inequality principle we can prove that an insult coming from a member of specific group is considered oppression, therefore it is legislated against to limit the rights of this specific group ; and ultimately can lead to the abolishment of the rights of an entire people and finally lead to the dehumanisation of an entire people - then you defence of the word might be something you may want to think about.

Is really badly worded so I'm going to guess what it means - you're basically describing a fantasy that I've seen on far right and libertarian bulletin boards that goes something along the lines of - if you let a minority legislate to protect itself then eventually they will abolish the majority's rights. 

This doesn't work in a liberal democratic system because the people who think like that a) don't understand liberalism and b) don't understand structural power of a majority in a liberal democracy. 

Firstly , the way a liberal democracy works is a balance - liberalism against democracy. So the rights of the individual always balance the rights of the majority. This means that there will always be a space where the individual , regardless of whether they are majority of minority is protected against harm but the opposite is also true - that the majority ie .. everyone not the individual ... will also be able to manifest its collective decision. 

This is why you have anti-democratic elements of a liberal democratic system like separation of judicial power and elements of bureaucracy ( more obvious in the US with parliament/executive/judiciary). 

This is why liberal democracies eventually led to non-discrimination laws - because the rights of the individual were being crushed by the rights of the majority. It became intellectually untenable to justify such practices as apartheid or Jim Crow laws and still be able to maintain that balance. 

Secondly this is why we have a normative statement such as the EHCR or the Us constitution which is set aside as a central part of the legal framework of a liberal democracy. Without accepting the NORMATIVE nature of the EHCR you cannot guarantee the balance of harms that liberal democracy functions on. 

Thus without the EHRC you cannot have that balance between the tyranny of the majority and the rights of the individual. This also means that a) you also can't have total freedom of individual rights as you always have to have a balance against that of others and b) it makes it very difficult for an individual to completely over-ride the majority outside the remit of the EHRC. 

Short version - the EHRC is what makes your fanstasist nightmare of the ""white majority"" being somehow overuled by a minority very very difficult to achieve without a major breakdown in the balance of laws that exist in the EHRC - ie someone like the UKIP would have to take us out of the EHRC or something. 

As for this:

&gt; urthermore, if you can prove that Clarkson does not consider you a human being (which you, from the textual context of him saying that, can't) , then I agree that he may be bad person - but that is an opinion which he alone must have on his conscience, it is not for society to punish thoughts. If he, however, abuses you physically or mentally (saying nigger to your face for every time he sees you) in a manner which would bring you to your mental breaking point (certified by professional psychologists, of course), then it's another story. 

Only in a private context. The context in public. He's at work for the BBC. It's the same offence as abuse in a work context. It isn't private thought. He's doing it while I pay for his job. 

As public corporation he's expected to adhere to the standards set out by the non-discrimination legislation in this country.  Here it's the BBC's responsibility it needs to explain why this was an acceptable practice at work, why they took the action / or lack of action they did. 

It's not calling for his sacking, it's a question for the BBC because I would like to know why a public corporation that I pay for through my licence fee is happy to allow that to happen. 

And asking for that is my right, as it is my right ot be offended and to ask for that. 

And yes defending Clarkson EVEN when I point all that out makes you an apologist for his actions. It's funny as a liberal you're not big on individuals taking responsibility for their actions. 

Clarkson needs to take responsibility for being an idiot in this case.

This is going to be last post on this topic, feel free to respond but I will take my time to get back to you even if I'm active on reddit.  I suggest you reread all the stuff by Bentham, Berlin , Rawls and all the liberal writers. I also suggest you make yourself familiar with the European and UK intellectual tradition on these matters because I think you have way too much exposure to the reddit libertarian wing. 

Last point, as someone from the post-soviet era, denying people of colour their rights and acknowledging their oppression doesn't make you less freedom loving or less liberal. I hazard that the role of the western left in championing anti-racism and non-discrimination in our countries has left you with the impression that helping out people of colour is somehow helping ""the left"". It isn't.

But the first document you linked says cost of the common agricultural policy is £398 per person. Does this translate into the statement ""EU membership adds £400 per year to household food bills"" - nope. This is why he has to include the point about it blocking cheaper imports, so people make the connection in their heads that if the food cost less then it would cost me less. I think the point about blocking cheaper imports is that the CAP as a policy helps farmers compete against cheaper imports. 

Seems like the statement is a lie. the £398 is not a direct tax accumulated from your shopping so getting rid of the CAP (which we would then have to compete with and pay our own farmers more subsidies) wouldn't reduce shopping costs by £398.

Sig likes to play farther up and it rarely involved in the build up play maybe because of who he is always paired with in the midfield. Mousa plays an entirely different style and is far more useful further up the pitch but I think his distribution is his weakness. Capoue started off the season so well with precise passing but his later appearances coming back from injury looked very off. His passing was not on point and he would just clatter into people instead of winning the ball. Benteleb has a problem with forward distribution. Sandro on his good days I would rate above Chadli and when he decides to dive in everywhere, he is a liability. However that being said I would take Holtby or Paulinho 100% over Chadli. 

Chadli may not be a superstar, (jack of all trades master of none type thing) but his link up play through the center was something that was not a consistent feature since Modric left.

As for the 4-4-2, I personally think it helped. We probably just the situation in different light and disagree on the subject.

true,Verify_Password_Btch,1905,Ashley Cole,"Sturridge was young and selfish, he knew he had practically zero chance of breaking into the first team which led to his erratic, selfish play and botched shots. He was lucky though. Unlike so many failed english prospects who never lose sight of the dream and forget reality, he realised his mistake (trying to break into a team that had no faith in the boy) packed up, made the right call, and managed to get into Liverpool. He would have never made it here, props to him for realising that. 

Ba is a centre forward much like Andy Carroll, gangly, awkward, but great at hold up play because of his physical presence. Simply put he's the guy you want to hoof the ball to, which is exactly what Chelsea DON'T want to do, he doesn't fit the system. Ba was an emergency signing no one thought we would actually have to make. 

Lukaku is inexperienced and I would hazard a guess that he won't ever make it at Chelsea given that the club is not patient enough to wait for the youngsters. I would dearly love to see him at Chelsea but he'll only make it here as a substitute striker, perhaps for the next two years, making 15-20 or so appearances a season before breaking into the first team on the third. Lukaku will take some time to get better. His style of play supposedly does not suit Chelsea, but we have not seen any effort from the club to mould him into the striker we want. Have they given him direction? Or have they told him to piss off numerous times? Who knows. What we do know is that the way he plays now is not the way Chelsea would like him to play.

Torres was a disaster from day one. He peaked and flourished at Liverpool and then injury ridden and in pain came to Chelsea. He looks stiff and old, even though his good looks tell a different story. Torres still wants to score, I know it, you know it, every fan should know it. You see it every time he manages to score a goal, (something which is so excruciating for him to do) and regains that little bit of confidence. But he lacks the desire and confidence, he's a shadow of his former self. Plus he's won everything there is to be won. There is no more motivation for him to do better. He being paid 300 thousand pounds a week. He would have, could have, should have fit the system perfectly but things didn't go that way, they took a darker route and here we are.

So we have Sturridge - The club had no faith in him. (He was too young and inexperienced)
Ba - The striker we never wanted. (Our befitting saviour)
Lukaku - The club does not have much faith in him from what we've seen. He does not fit the system with his current play style. (But the fans love him)
Torres - Old, in pain and unfit. The club CLEARLY has no faith in him. No one has any faith in him, just a few deluded fans.

The problems I see are that:
a) The club needs a very good striker to play the fast attacking play style Chelsea is shaping up to have.
b) We don't know if such a striker exists that can cope with the way Chelsea play, because no club in recent memory have played the way Chelsea play.
c) The club has a huge lack of faith in its strikers which is severely affecting their confidence in front of goal.

The solutions to these problems are (given we buy Diego Costa):
a) Mourinho is not an idiot, he knows how Costa plays and will change the system to suit him better.
b) Costa is a fucking good player who is miles ahead of all of the strikers we've had in recent memory (bar our god Drogba who has been elevated to legendary status)
c) The club will have and should have faith in Diego Costa because anything short of that would just be idiotic from the club. I hope my club is not run by morons with no faith in the team!

FSG took over a team that was disturbing close to administration and they stabilized our finances. With the strength of our youth system, our veterans and Brendan Rodgers we have quickly advanced to second in league and the Champions League.

The result is an additional 22.8m pounds for finishing second in the League and 77m pounds in TV revenue. (There's a thread about it on /r/LiverpoolFC right [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/25dpi7/liverpool_earn_premier_league_high_of_99m_for/))

Now with the added revenue, plus whatever we had budgeted for this summer window, we have the opportunity to get one of the Premier League's most exciting players, a player who seems to be Premier League (and England!) ready. It's time to get players that appear to be ready to contribute **now** and the 26-year-old Adam Lallana seems to be the kind of player who is entering his prime (Suarez, by comparison, is 27).

Is it a gamble? Sure. Every transfer is, isn't it? But now these are gambles we can afford to make. And, frankly, I don't think it's that much of a gamble.",0,1399947926,null,0,false,0,chgicad,t3_25e7k3,t1_chgicad,t3_25e7k3,null,1433771086,10,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,10

This is something that most of the knee-jerkers in this sub refuse to accept. That the playstyle of our young midfielders is a strong contributer to the lacklustre success of our strikers.

Our current younger midfielders (Willian, Oscar, Hazard in particular) do not play in a fashion that benefits strikers.

Their style of play is to combine between each other at the edge of the box, and try to create space for their own shots.
It does work for them, which is why it goes somewhat unnoticed - but strikers simply cannot thrive in that system.

They do not routinely look for the early balls to a through-running attacker.
I can even remember in games where Schurrle was briefly tried up front - he would make great runs behind, but Willian and co. would never see him.

I think Costa will be more successful at creating his own chances than our current Strikers... but I highly doubt he'll be a 20+ goal beast, when that kind of season relies so much on getting consistently good supply",0,1399949246,null,0,false,0,chgiyqk,t3_25dwek,t1_chgiyqk,t1_chgcvee,null,1433771445,6,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,6

Prolific attacker is a bit of a stretch.  He's got the same number of goals as Sterling who's played nearly 1,000 less minutes and I wouldn't call Sterling 'prolific' necessarily.  Last season Lallana only had 3 goals, taking his Premier League career total to all of 12.  

Lallana's only got like what, 3 caps?  I suppose that makes him an England international, but not by much really.  He is versatile though, that is certainly true.

I think he's good, but I don't think he's better (or not substantially so) than what we have already.  Is he better than Coutinho?  Perhaps, but I don't think he's much better and Coutinho has time on his side.  Is he better playing wide than Sterling?  I'd say no, personally.  In a box-to-box CM role, is he better than Henderson?  Again, I'd say no.  

Let me ask a different way- England international with 2 caps, scored 9 goals and had 5 assists.  Also creates a chance every 42 minutes and a tackle every 69 minutes.  Would you say that's a £25M player?  If so, those are Sterling's stats and they're largely better than or similar to Lallana's and he's only 19.

So £20M+ (guessing closer to £25M is what Soton will want) for a player marginally better than kids we already have?  For me personally, it wouldn't be the deal I would be looking to do is all.  I'm not going to protest the lad if he comes in or anything stupid as he is a good player and I don't see anyone saying he's not, I just don't think he's worth what is likely being asked for him, that's all.",0,1399955476,null,0,false,0,chgljzz,t3_25e7k3,t1_chgljzz,t1_chgkvn6,null,1433772676,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Taking the train almost the whole length of the country is going to cost you pretty harshly, but maybe less than hiring a car for several weeks. It might be better to prebook off-peak-time trains (and be willing to change and take routes that meander around a bit rather than a direct line) for the travel up to Scotland and then hire a car for your time there doing whatever you're doing. 

There's also nothing worse I can think of than driving for hours at a time in a car that's not your own, in a country with unfamiliar traffic rules, staring at the tarmac or the back end of an Eddie Stobarts for the duration of your trip up north, after experiencing the joy of escaping central London on four wheels.

**PVA** (not English but considered homegrown even for Champions League. Would be a decent backup LB option)

**Chalobah** (Could be place at 4th choice DM and CB, ease him into it.)

**Bamford** (Everywhere he's been on loan he's scored plenty, despite him being on loan at League 1 and Championship levels. He's done well and some people who watch him consider him to be better than Lukaku. So he is an option for being a 3rd striker.)

**Rooney** (I still think he might be an option. Because players sometimes transfer after a new contract, it just makes it a little more difficult. Furthermore, if Van Gaal takes over Man Utd and makes RVP his main man, Rooney might want out.)

**Shaw** (doesn't represent value for me, but a young player on the rise, apparently a Chelsea fan.)

**Barkley** (a little hit and miss. People tend to judge him from his highlights but it's important to recognise how players play over the 90 minutes.)

**Lallana** (seems a pretty good player, but not really what we need atm.)

**Jay Rodriguez** (could be a decent 2nd striker option, depending on how his recovery pans out. He was playing pretty well before his injury.)

Our English core (Cole, Terry, Lampard and mayber Cahill) is getting old and may start to break off with Cole leaving and Lampard the year later. So as you claimed, we should replace these players with other Englishmen, the problem is there isn't a wealth of talent available who are English.

My point is though that in London, should the tube be on strike there are other, viable, options for a non-driver getting too/from work.  True they might be heavily over subscribed with one of the other services not working... but they are there.

I totally agree about companies not moving. My company tried to move its zone 6 office to Reading, so not exactly far (and on nice high speed quick trains from London). They had to abandon it because the Londoners threatened to resign if forced to move.

The result is that instead some of their SE offices are being moved to zone 6 (fucking expensive lease and the assinine internal accounting means they can palm the cost off onto every department that moves in) and it's a huge pain in the arse to get to.

So? People were complaining even when the EU was founded and will always complain about something. At the moment UK does the most of complain.

&gt;You could go to work anywhere you wanted before the EU existed, so long as there was a need (and there always was).

Have you experienced it yourself? I don't think so. The ""there was need"" is completely rubbish. I originally wanted to migrate to the US. Good luck with that. In the yearly visa lottery from the USA I didn't even get a confirmation that I wasn't selected. How else could I do it? Especially just after finishing high school, having no proper skill and no money? Well, there are obviously desperate people who jump the lorry..... but do it for yourself you smart ass.

&gt;You're using small, personal experiences to combat what are extremely serious problems in the EU.

And you're using arguments which are not really fully thought off. How many different things the UK government started doing and these happened to be rubbish? What is wrong with trying to change things, for example by setting out this MAS service? I think it's a very good idea and you know why? It's because people too often lack common sense and need to be told things which are terribly obvious. Don't ask me why, they are probably very stupid and you have to admit it. That service is a good idea, especially when the global recession hit. Whether it works, that's a different question but we won't know until we try.

The 80mln spent is nothing compared to the budget. Have you seen the new type of tax summaries when it shows you how much was spent on what? See where the overseas aid is, when the EU money is and all the rest. Let me know how really expensive some things are to the taxpayer, especially things like the EU.

In the first five months of the season prior to joining us in January he made 7 appearances in the league mostly from the bench. There were plenty of doubts about his ability, all you'd have to do it go back to reddit at the time of the transfer to see that.

I agree with you that Rodwell has never really set the world alight. However I'd also say that he's never been allowed to reach his potential. He has had hamstring problems which alone could be a good reason to steer clear of him but City obviously saw some potential in him. 

I'm not suggesting that he'd be a marquee player. This isn't Fifa though and if we were able to pick him up for a good price (like £8mill or less) then I think it could be good business. We have a serious lack of defensive mid options and we really need to bolster our squad for both league and Champions League duties next season. Picking up players who have PL experience is important and we cannot afford to buy 5 or 6 players at the £20million mark.

Would love keeping him in for this season but being 3rd choice would seriously hurt his development.

&gt; Rooney (I still think he might be an option. Because players sometimes transfer after a new contract, it just makes it a little more difficult. Furthermore, if Van Gaal takes over Man Utd and makes RVP his main man, Rooney might want out.)

I agree, if not Costa / Cavani, we might be after him . Rooney+Lukaku seems decent enough

One of the reasons Waterboarding was used was that many terrorist and insurgent groups have a cultural and religious obligation to not inform on their counterparts, but this is forgiven if evidence is given up after torture because it was obviously not free or fair.

Obviously torture on its own or stupid torture doesn't work, but it can be effective in gathering, comparing and contrasting pre-existing evidence.

This previously was used to uncover terrorist cells. However, getting wise to this the structure of these cells evolved to avoid this, with smaller self-sufficient groups where no one knows too much or their allies elsewhere.

It also could be used short term in the 'ticking bomb' scenario which is the strongest principled example whereby almost everyone if forced to accept the actual scenario would support torture, but fortunately that scenario is bullshit, never happens and never would happen for obvious reasons.

Work remains regarding this small and technical constitutional detail of the rule of law. I believe it to be the only vehicle of our liberty. The people unite to form a single body directed towards its common good. This is the body politic.  For it to be free, this body, just like individuals, must be capable of forming and executing a single will. The body politic forms its will through the political process, declares it through the legislature, and executes it through the impartial application of law by the executive branch of government. At least, this is what it should and must do if we are to be free as a people. How else do you propose we should or could be?

A few flops? Understatement of the century. David Cornell, Jake Caprice, Stephane Bahoken, Gary Harkins and Danny Grainger were all signed in the summer only to be punted by January. Then he brought in Djemba-Djemba, when central midfield was the one area that didn't need improving, and Adam Campbell, who Lennon raved about when he signed but almost never played. Lennon was an absolute disaster in the transfer market. People sometimes give him credit for playing young players, but he was actually forced to because his signings were so awful. Sean Kelly and Jason Naismith had to play because there was no-one else to try. Releasing Graham Carey seemed a particularly bizarre decision in the summer also. And letting Mair go to Thistle and then not replacing him, leaving us with two centre backs at the club. The list goes on and on.

true,Hydron8,null,null,"&gt;On balance, the statement is correct.

No, I guess we'll have to agree to disagree on this point. As far as I understood the policy proposal was allowing small employers to negotiate a more flexible contract with the employee. i.e. if they only want 2 weeks holiday in exchange for every wednesday off, etc. then they should be allowed to do so. I don't think ""scrapping your holiday entitlement"" reflects that honestly personally, but you clearly do. 

There's no point discussing the rights and wrongs of the proposal because it's not even current policy- we have to wait until the 2015 manifesto is released. 

&gt;The British Bill of Rights can in no way, as a matter of our constitution, be as far reaching or as entrenched

Ok, having done a bit more research you may have a point here, although the statement on the poster is still misleading. 

Although I am still in favour of pulling out of the ECHR. Unaccountable judges making decisions that often endanger the public are not in the national interest. I'd be willing to relax the interpretation of ""right to a family life"" for example, if it means people who are a serious danger can be removed from the country. The alternative is worse. 

&gt;they only thing preventing overreach is a motion scrapping the bill

And do you think people would accept that? If a future government scrapped all our human rights laws, I don't think they'd last more than a few days. And if such a government did come to power and was really determined, they could just pull out of the ECHR anyway... 

On a separate point it was in the last conservative manifesto to enact a british bill of rights, but it seems to be dead in the water. 

Anyway 1/10 is pretty poor for accuracy.

There had also been a more exciting near miss between a Herc and Tornado in the same place a few months earlier, so he was likely particularly suspicious of Tornados possibly being sent into the area without knowing he was there.

Although the Tornado wasn't closer than was safe, he was certainly closer than was necessary, and that's the gist of the USAF comments on the incident - the sky's a big place, you knew we were there, why did you choose to be there too even if it was safe?",0,1399982107,null,0,false,0,chgr9j3,t3_25fflj,t1_chgr9j3,t1_chgp5a3,null,1433775365,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

CB I'd like Caulker.

LB, Moreno or Rodriguez would be great, but they're in demand

CM, Kovacic or Clasie, someone young who is happy with a pressing game. 

W/CAM, Lallana seems to be who we're going for.

Both we and they have switched allegiances around the world many times in the last 100 years. Don't make me list them. Just because we have been allies throughout this period that doesn't mean we always will be. 

&gt; Since when does ""allies"" connote that any given county has a remit to wade into any random dispute it has no actual stake in? 

Because that's what allies do. We even had specific mutual defence agreements with them that they would step in if attacked by a third-party. 

Had this ""special relationship"" existed they would have completely turned their back on their friendly military junta in South America. I'm not demanding full military support, as you say we didn't need it. But normally when someone attacks your friend you aren't supposed to remain on fantastic terms with the aggressor. Argentina was seen as America's greatest ally against socialism in South America and this remained constant before and after the invasion of the Falklands.

Prohibition, astonishingly, isn't doing much good.  Who'da'funk'it?

However, criminalising it most definitely *is* stopping people use it.  Me for example.  I'd take a hell of a lot more cocaine if I could just walk into a shop and pick up a gram, then stroll around town boshing keys as openly as smoking cigarettes.  

To pretend it is as easy to get cocaine now as it would be if it was actually legal, is quite frankly just plain wrong.  For you personally, maybe, but for the population as a whole - obviously not.

Also, it seems to be a very vogue opinion nowadays to pretend drugs are all a ""*health issue*"", and everybody taking drugs needs help.  It's such a bullshit passive aggressive attitude, and wrong, of course.  If taking drugs meant you needed medical help, then every single human in the world would technically need to be in rehab - which would suggest the terms on which people need to be in rehab are a bit off.

And coming back to the idea of freeing up Police time by legalising.  Alcohol is legal, and I don't think anything takes up *more* police time on Friday and Saturday nights.

In the landlord / agency / tenant relationship, the property owner is the one with all the power, because there's a limited number of them.

Whereas an advert in the paper will attract a number of potential tenants to select from, it's landlords that agencies court in order to increase their revenue.

Pissing off a tenant only affects an agency's revenue for a month or two, at most - retaining a landlord is *years* of income.

Proprietor landlords can be arseholes about things like this, because £100 spent on the property is literally £100 less in their own pocket - and a new fridge, a carpet cleaning service or repainting the living room is rarely so little as £100.

If landlords kick up enough fuss, employees of agencies will tend to side with them for an easy life - they can get away with shouting and abuse in a way that tenants cannot. ",0,1399983149,null,0,false,0,chgrii9,t3_25fsjf,t1_chgrii9,t1_chgr5yv,null,1433775481,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

It's probably in ""everyones"" interest that he leaves Liverpool, he is at a stage in his career where he has shown he can perform at a high level, and he needs to play games, preferably as a central striker.

He wont get to do that at Liverpool next season. Sure he'll get some games, but not as many as he would like. He also doesn't strike me as the ""super-sub"" kind of player. 

So we need someone who can progress whilst sitting on the bench whilst getting the odd game here and there and games off the bench, primarely out wide. Borini in my opinion needs to play games. So for sporting reasons it doesn't make sense for either side for him to stay at Liverpool.

However, I think we might keep him, because we need squad depth. I don't think we would get enough for him to replace him.

With that said, I have been to a few smaller festivals around the South/South West of England as well as Reading and have to say that smaller festivals are by far the best things in the world. Here's a run down of the better ones I've been to:

**2000 Trees**

[Website](http://www.twothousandtreesfestival.co.uk/)

[Promo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3K8RFDdI64)

This beautiful little festival is only 7 years old. Its just outside Cheltenham so hopefully not miles from you and has a capacity of 5000 people, so shouldn't be too overwhelming. Tickets are about £80 for the weekend which is pretty good value. I went for the first time when I was 16 and it was the first festival I'd ever been to. I've been back every year for the last 6 years. Their tagline is ""new underground British music"" and they have a pretty good record of getting bands to play who later turn out to be pretty famous, I've seen Frank Turner and Twin Atlantic play there to crowds of only a hundred people or so. I think that almost all of my favourite bands are ones that I first heard here. I can not recommend this festival highly enough.


**Greenman**

[Website](http://www.greenman.net/)

[Promo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXhXeMEqlYk)

Slightly bigger festival, I think around 15,000 people, so still tiny compared to Reading/Glastonbury etc. Tickets are slightly more expensive at around £140 if I remember correctly. With its bigger size it can attract some more famous bands, when I went I saw Noah and the Whale, Laura Marling, Explosions In The Sky and Tim Minchin to name a few. I've only been once and it is probably the least festivaly festival I've been to. It was less getting drunk in a field and then seeing some bands and more of an ""experience"". They have a bunch of activities other than bands such as poetry readings, a cinema and fair ground rides. Its main demographic is definitely shifted from the normal early twenties students to mid thirties Guardian readers. I really loved it and it is a bit different to your standard getting hammered every night experience that you often get at other festivals. The line-up this year is fantastic too!


**Arc Tan Gent**

[Website](http://arctangent.co.uk/)

[Promo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkvDl2QCBg)

This little festival is just South of Bristol. Last year was the first year it existed. Its run by the same people who do 2000 Trees, but focusses on the more rock-y type bands, mostly post-rock and math-rock which isn't necessarily my cup of tea. I worked on the bar last year in exchange for a free ticket and really enjoyed myself. Although its not music I listen to a lot of, I still saw plently of bands I really enjoyed, and met lots of great people there. If that kind of music is your thing, its definitely worth a try.

**Larmar Tree**

[Website](http://larmertreefestival.co.uk/)

I've never been to this festival but its been on my radar for a couple of years and the line-up this year looks great. It is just outside Salisbury, so if you're around the Isle of White, this shouldn't be too far for you either. 


That's about it for my experience, I have also been to Reading and a few smaller festivals further North, as well as one in Holland so feel free to ask about them if you're interested. But my recomendation would be, evberyone should at least try going to a festival and I think a great place to start would be one of the smaller ones. Although I enjoyed seeing all the big bands at Reading and had a good time, due to there being so many people, it is not really a very pleasant place to be.

Hardly. The point of what she is saying is that there is no magical entity called ""society"" or ""government"" which is forced to do anything. That responsibility for looking after oneself relies first and foremost on the individual, then family &amp; friends and it is that relationship between individuals and families and neighbours that forms what society is. 

From her quote, it should be the job of the person to first ask ""What can I do to find a home"" not ""Government give me a home"".

Framed another way what is trade off betwee entitlement and responsibility. Should we absolve individuals from all behavioural issue because it is not their fault?

Er nah, I think it needs to be done: Please list the ""many times"" the U.S. and UK have suspended relations, ending up on opposite sides of a conflict.

&gt; Just because we have been allies throughout this period that doesn't mean we always will be. 

This is just a truism. I asked for something a bit more solid than that. What are the specific precedents or warnings you're citing for your view?

&gt; We even had specific mutual defence agreements with them that they would step in if attacked by a third-party. 

Leaving aside that (by necessity) you're focusing exclusively on one hardly representative episode - in the case of Argentina actually no: There was no agreement requiring the US to step in in the side of the UK in that situation.

&gt; Had this ""special relationship"" existed

...that I never actually mentioned or cited...

&gt; they would have completely turned their back on their friendly military junta in South America.

Except that they had even better reasons for not antagonizing Latin America than they did the UK (who they were at least on good terms with on every other issue). I also note you're eager to cite the supposed NATO agreement that required the US to support the UK, but ignoring the Rio pact, that required the US to support Latin counties if they were attacked (though in the event, neither was valid in that situation).

&gt; Argentina was seen as America's greatest ally against socialism in South America and this remained constant before and after the invasion of the Falklands.

1) We are paid due to how valuable our skills are in a marketplace. That is the basis of capitalism. It has nothing to do with rewarding skills, skills which are valuable put you in a better bargaining position.

2) Pay of Nurses. To quote 'Prospects':

&gt;Salaries for Band 5 under the NHS Agenda for Change Pay Rates  (the entry point for graduate nurses) start at £21,388, rising to £27,901. Salaries in London attract a high-cost area supplement.
Salaries at senior level (Bands 7-9 in the NHS) range from £30,764 - £98,453.
Comparable rates of pay exist in the private sector. Contact individual providers for details.

They are comparing one of the best businessman in the country at the height of his earning potential to an average nurse. The best nurses are earning £98,000. 

3) The biggest misconception imaginable. They say that most people in poverty are those in work, and that 'growing numbers are resorting to using foodbanks to survive'. The overwhelming majority of people using foodbanks (80%) do not do so because of low pay in work and the majority of uses are repeat individuals who are being refered. Note, they are showing three people in work and then six people in the line for the foodbank, the inference being that the overwhelming majority of people in work are waiting for foodbanks. Which is bullshit and what the Mail frequently does with crappy Immigration stories. Furthermore, the overwhelming majority of issues associated with foodbanks are due to benefit changes, not issues in work and even if they were, those are not the people the clip is talking about (http://www.trusselltrust.org/stats)

4) The tangental link between the amount average people are being paid and income inequality. Never explained, linked or justified. Just purely asserted. But it goes straight to a rich guy. Which is entirely out of the Mail 'Look at these immigrants in a rich house from benefits! All benefits are bad!' school of propaganda.

5) Higher income for some means lower incomes for others. No. It doesn't. We have this thing called capitalism, efficiency, trade, economic growth. They are just blankly asserting that poor British people are being robbed by rich British people. Considering the largest companies in the UK get the majority of their money selling goods and services to other countries you need to have some link between those people selling stuff to other people and people on the street getting poorer.",0,1399986115,null,0,false,0,chgsct7,t3_25fu15,t1_chgsct7,t1_chgrqnr,null,1433775879,19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,19

However, I think it's time to move on. He doesn't fit anywhere in our midfield unfortunately. I believe Brendan tried him in a more attacking role in the final games this season to see how he fared. If he could be a Henderson/Allen type of player. Unfortunately he seemed to lack the quality and fitness needed for that role.

If we swap Gerrard for Lucas, or any ""pure"" DM in our system, we lose way to much and almost have to restructure our entire midfield. We need a player in that position to dictate the tempo and controll play. Lucas is not that player, Lucas plays next to that player and lets him do his thing as effectively as possible. 

In my opinion we need to look for the next Alonso, someone who can dictate play and pass it around but who can also get stuck in and fight for possession.

true,lepusfelix,null,null,"My take on inequality is that we're supposed to be all in it together (thanks, Dave).

While it makes sense for people who do higher risk, harder, more stressful and high education demand jobs get paid more than those who do other jobs, I believe that this should be approached from a background of everyone being equally a part of one entity (the UK).

For simplification purposes, I'm going to reduce the entire UK to two people. Richard Branson and me (jobseeker). If we were the only two people in the UK, we'd have to rely on each other to survive. I sincerely doubt Richard is actually the best example, because he wasn't exactly born into wealth, and also gives a hell of a lot anyway, but still... merely talking about income levels and inequality, not so much background and attitudes. We'd have to rely on each other to survive. I'd not be his personal skivvy, and he'd not be mine.

However, there are more than 2 people in the UK. We still all rely on each other to survive. It's still a two-way relationship like that. Even people without jobs play a part in it. Unlike the DM stereotype of people sitting around drinking beer and playing video games in designer clothes, the unemployed serve the country on two fronts. Firstly, many of us take part in other activities, such as volunteering, being active members of the community, helping our own families and such. We also drive the economy by spending money locally, which helps small businesses. We keep other people employed. Not entirely useless at all. The richest also aren't useless. They pay more tax (well... the ones who actually pay tax do), they pump money into things that help others, plus they're probably just as much active community members as anyone else.

My point is that we all rely on each other, and it's senseless to point fingers at people and degrade them by questioning their value. What I believe the solution to growing inequality is is to try to ensure that people start from the same level. To establish a basic minimum and maximum from which all people inside the group (UK) have a somewhat similar chance to develop the same prospects from. Whether they achieve similar results is entirely on them, at that point.

Someone who starts off with almost nothing right now has very limited options in life, while someone who had mega-rich grandparents and super-rich parents is not really likely to have to work very hard to create opportunities. I think one answer to this is a Universal Basic Income. Everybody gets it, so it's not a support for poor people, but it does at least mean that nobody's starting at zero. I would also recommend closing tax loopholes (why isn't this done already?). Also, we need to find ways in which people who are currently unemployed, unskilled and such can get access to better training for jobs that exist. It makes no sense to me that entry level jobs are badly oversubscribed while anything that takes a certain level of qualification struggles to fill vacancies. Employment is a big issue, and it seems to be one that, while they're always trying to handle it, they're always trying the stuff that'll never work rather than analysing supply and demand and matching the two.

Demonizing 'scroungers' and immigrants is a side effect of a failed system. Through objective analysis, skill matching and relevant training, I think it's plausible that very low rates of unemployment can be achieved. Through effective housing management, overpopulation need not be a problem. While we can't feasibly continue to grow in population infinitely, it is nowhere near at breaking point when one person can have 10 or more homes, and there are people living in shop doorways. It's just unintelligently managed.

Speaking of growing infinitely.. I think it's about time someone addressed the problem of the very hungry caterpitalism. Many good ideas, but the reliance on infinite growth, which is impossible with finite resources, is not one of them. Again, I'd recommend intelligent management. We need an economy that isn't going to drastically affect millions when there's a recession. One that grows and shrinks just like any other, but doesn't force the entire country to rely on infinite growth. It needs to be made sustainable.

I'm the other way, I'm 20 something and would never ever take a job in London. I don't want to live there. ever.

Absolutely this.  I was on a graduate program which placed fuckloads of people in London.

They were *all* house sharing (or still living at home if home was a sensible commute), they were very coy on their finances which made me honestly believe most of them were skint, they were just as ambivalent about their jobs and general lifestyles as anyone else... and really, they weren't out partying every single night at all.  Plenty of people would spend the occasional weekend with their parents or old school friends well out of London.

So why be in London?  I feel like I should ""do a stint"", but at 26 I'm probably too old and would arrive just in time to see at least some of them leaving.  Why bother?

It looks like the MOTD guys were informed enough to know about this, but not informed enough to know that part of this debt was due to a new training ground development and part of this fee will be made up from the sale of Osvaldo.

Also we have seen that Katharina Liebherr is taking more of an interest in Saints (attending games, reshuffling the board), which will hopefully lead to sustained investment in the club.

I suspect that we might lose Shaw this summer, it is frustrating for us but it looks like teams that can offer him champions league next season have identified him as a target. Also £27m+ is a lot of money for a LB.

3) No. And when the Mail is showing pictures of immigrant criminals and benefit scroungers they are not explicitly making the case against welfare and immigration. You would have to be an idiot to make the same conclusion that they are leading to...

Recently most of the shelter's guests are easten european men who came looking for work, found it much harder than they expected and ran out of money 'between jobs'. They usually move town to find work fairly quickly.

The point she makes is that the default expectation should not be for the state to wade in and wave its fairy wand and make things better. In the small government view of the world the state should simply not be in this area. The Left tends to take a maternalistic view of the Government, it should be there for every eventualilty and to distribute wealth. In many right-wingers view the state should be as small as possible and leave people to form their own support mechanisms, charities for example, many of which pre-dated the State.

EDIT: The reason for this can be sen in the Little Englander view of the world. If you depend on others for support you have a responsibility to those people on a personal level.

true,sittingonahillside,null,null,"no snow. We'll get a few days of moderate snow at most, or if we're 'lucky' then a couple weeks worth but it'll still be moderate. UK weather is moderate, it just changes fast. Usually overcast, but it can be warm (seldom _hot_), windy, grey, bright and wet all in one day. This week especially. If you're hoping for nice weather, just forget that now.

Depending on where you live, public transport may be worth it. Nottingham has brilliant public transport for the most part and it's fairly cheap. £50 a month (bus pass) will get you just about everywhere within Nottingham and a few places a little further out. If you have to pay to park (a lot of city centre offices) then it adds up really fast and it isn't cheap. Have fun spending all your time getting out of those mulit-stories day in day out and then getting stuck in inner city traffic. The areas outside of Nottingham can be a complete grid lock, usually Wednesday's for some reason. My girlfriend can walk to the city centre (4 miles) from where she works, quicker than most buses will get her there, sometimes.

schools can depend. Unless you're going private, it's much harder (near impossible) to put your kids in schools that aren't in your catchment area. I was lucky enough to attend a decent state school due the area I lived. So research that first and if the schools in your area aren't what you'd like then consider private if you can afford it. Keep in mind, a public school in the UK is a private school. We do have private places though, worry not.

Where to live? Well, that depends on your income and what you're willing to shell out. The Park &amp; Mapperly Park are your two upper choices for city centre and just outside the city centre. Very, very nice places, especially Mapperly Park, but also very expensive. A bit further out you're looking at Wollaton and Beeston Fields Drive, Attenborough and Chilwell have some really nice places as well. Housing is weird in Nottingham, you need to come check it out. Stapleford for example is an average area, some streets better than others, but then you get a few streets / roads with incredibly nice and expensive houses. That goes for just about every suburb of Nottingham, it's very hit and miss. Carrington has some really nice streets with beautiful houses, as does Woodthorpe. All are walking distance to the centre, within reason. 

You might be better off buying a car while here. Long term leasing will cost you, but again if you can afford it. Beware, our car insurance costs will probably make you want to vomit, regardless of income. Perhaps you can get a company car?

Honestly, so much depends on your income, if you're considering private schooling then I have little doubt you have better choices than most, so don't fret too much. 

Boots / BCM by any chance? If so, you're working outside the city centre, so look into Beeston / Chilwell / Wollaton / Stapleford / Breaston (a little further out, but some really nice places). It'll save you driving around and through the city centre everyday, and they'll be considerably cheaper. 

Also wroth noting that Nottingham is about as central as you can get, you're just a few miles from the motorway and a couple of hours away from most of the major cities in the country. Brilliant rail connections as well, National Express (you'd probably not use) and close to the Peak District. 

If you're used to really long commutes then you could always consider some of the smaller villages, all depends on what you're looking for though.

PM for any more details, more than happy to help anyway I can. Looking to move myself (within Nottingham) and I know how daunting it is, already knowing the place. Let alone a foreigner with a family.

I recently finished my [8th wheel build](https://www.flickr.com/photos/zzpza/sets/72157644068527830) and have two more lined up for a friend. The hardest part is getting the spoke length right, but you can use an online calculator to work out the length(s) required for the pattern you wish to have depending on your hubs &amp; rims. Lacing is straight forward, but you might get the alignment wrong (mostly cosmetic, but can effect access to the valve with a pump) so you may need to take it apart and start again. Truing and tensioning is fairly easy, if time consuming. I prefer a truing stand, but it can be done without one using the bike upside down to hold the new wheels as you true them. I would whole heartedly recommend getting a tensiometer though.

However, if you need to keep cost to a minimum, or can't be without your bike for any length of time, I would just buy a replacement wheelset. Building your own wheels is enormously satisfying, and hand built wheels are (usually) much stronger than machine built ones.

Edit: I would also recommend adding a dynamo hub to your front wheel build so you don't have to worry about batteries for your lights any more. It would mean changing to dynamo lights though.

It's really laid back and I've never seen anyone there causing trouble.

If you're going alone, be sure to check out the [forums](http://www.greenman.net/forums/general-discussion) as there's a meetup every year at one of the bar/beer-tents. It'll likely be arranged in the [Flying Solo 2014](http://www.greenman.net/forum/flying-solo-2014) thread. Anyone can go to the meetup of course, whether they're on their own or not, it's just so people have someone to hang out with.

Also, remember to bring wellies. Some years the weather is amazing but other times it can rain heavily causing a fair amount of mud. (That probably applies to any festival, but the mud at Green Man is like clay.)

**Communism** - Doesn't matter who runs, nobody wins, nobody loses. Everyone wears the same boots. Everyone gets the same prize. The joy of having taken part.

**Resource Based Economy** - All race participants are bundled into a computer-controlled bus and everyone inside gets some input into how it drives, while the computer disregards inefficient inputs. By coordinating with each other, they all cross the finish line together.

Where do you draw the line. Physical violence? I would draw the line at Assault. In law an assault is any action which makes the victim feel like they are in danger of physical violence. You don't actually have to be physically attacked to be assaulted.

 I think a screaming crowd of people getting in your face, a group of people who obviously hate you and everything you might believe, who believe you are as bad a a Nazi would be quite an intimidating presence, no matter what your age. And it would not take much to feel like you were in danger.

If they were standing across the street, away from you just making their opinions know to passers by then there would be no feeling of danger. That is not how most UKIP protesters behave though. There is a difference between protest and intimidation, and many of these protest groups cross it. 

&gt;""I fought the Nazis so I can't be fascist"" isn't an argument that holds water.

Nor is you vote UKIP so you are a Nazi. The difference is if you lived through WW2 you would probably have a right to claim you have a better idea of what a Nazi is. 

I'd be pretty upset if I had seen my friends and family killed by Nazis during the war, if I had risked my life to fight against those ideas.

When you do watch Costa, you'll notice how much he resembles Drogba at Marseille. Pace, power, likes to beat his defender, excellent header of the ball, can hold up the ball, brings other players in to play beautifully, creates space in the opposition box with his movement and strength. 

As for his attitude, its come on leaps and bounds. He has 7 yellow cards as opposed to 11 last season. And 0 red cards. I don't care if he tries to ruffle the CBs by being a thug on the pitch as long as he doesn't get sent off.

true,B4mf0rth,null,null,"quick run down of the academic debate on whether torture can be justified, or more importantly, whether or not it should be legalised. 

The third of Britons are loosely correct - torture can be justified. You can easily think of any number of philosophical hypotheticals where torture would be a morally justified activity. Save entire world by torturing one known violent criminal for example. And once you break your principle against torture, all that is left is to haggle over the price (as said by Solis, 2010).

Now of course there are more realistic examples where most people would be happy for torture to take place. These are classically referred to as the Ticking Bomb scenarios - Example:

Nuclear bomb placed somewhere in a city, going to go off in 24 hours. you have the guy, you have sufficiently good information to know that he knows where it is. He's not phased by normal interrogation techniques and time is running out - 

Most people would agree if this scenario was the case, torture is justified. The main point of contention comes with the example itself,  as it is ultimately unlikely that such a situation with such perfect information would ever arise. If the example is unrealistic, torture can't be justified using it.

However people still use this scenario to argue torture should be legally institutionalised, such as [Alan Dershowitz's torture warrants](http://www.alandershowitz.com/publications/docs/torturewarrants.html). Countries like Israel, Indonesia etc also use it to justify their *cough 'enhanced interrogation' techniques.

However many scholars find the ""unrealistic"" argument to be insufficient against the Ticking Bomb Example, as such a situation or one similar to it is not that implausible, and given many people are convinced by it as shown by polls in the UK and in America. We need a better argument against torture.

Scholars first redefined the debate from whether or not torture can be justified, because clearly it is theoretically possible that it can be. The debate is now whether or not it should be legally institutionalised - ie should our police, armed forces and security services be able to legitimately torture suspects in situations like a Ticking Bomb Scenario. This is what Dershowitz was arguing for, a judge could give a torture warrant just like a search warrant, legitimising the process. 

There are advantages to this - it would make the process more accountable, less clandestine. A series of techniques could be researched and implemented to make the process more efficient, hygienic and lessen long term impacts on the suspect. 

However, it falls to the slippery slope argument. If we legalise torture because of a ticking bomb hypothetical, you can then remove the judge and warrant process by making a hypothetical where there isn't time to seek a warrant. It also isn't hard to imagine that torture would become a widespread technique, as the lower limit to which a suspect can be tortured would be completely arbitrary? Do we set it at 1000 possible casualties? 100 people about to die? Why not 99? Why not 50? How about 10 kids? how about 5 kids? There are other arguments too, all which show legally institutionalising torture is a profoundly bad idea.

Most scholars have settled on what is the best option (not perfect, but if we lived in a perfect world, there wouldn't be any terrorists in the first place). This is called the Dirty Harry case -

 It basically involves torture being absolutely illegal, not institutionalised at all. And if such a scenario like the dirty bomb scenario came up, and a security service operative needed to torture a suspect for certain information, he would do so acting completely as an individual, without any institutional or legal backing. Therefore regardless of consequences, he will be tried as a criminal before a court. If he has saved an entire city, one would imagine a jury would take that into account and offer a reduced sentence. If he hasn't, then he would face the long prison sentence. 

This is the best decision. Dirty bomb scenarios are too rare and unrealistic to legalise torture, and if we did, the effect on society would be profoundly evil. However we need a contingency for  when those scenarios do arise. So under Dirty Harry, the operative who chooses to torture knows he will face prison for his actions, so there is an incentive to only torture when information is perfect and the risk is very high. The decision to torture is down to his discretion, and he knows a court will judge his actions. 

This isn't the perfect option, there are many problems with it. But it is the best option available to us as a modern society.

**EDIT** - *if any of you ever feel too happy, and feel a need to bring yourself down a bit, read the Sussman and Steinhoff papers. They are exceptionally engaging and really convey the true horrors of torture whilst retaining the academic distance needed to discuss political necessity. Excerpt from Sussman* - 

&gt; ""...torture forces its victim into the position of colluding against himself through his own affects and emotions, so that he experiences himself as simultaneously powerless and yet actively complicit in his own violation. So construed, torture turns out to be not just an extreme form of cruelty, but the pre-eminent
instance of a kind of forced self-betrayal, more akin to rape than other kinds of
violence characteristic of warfare or police action.""

 He elaborates:

&gt; ""What the torturer does is to take his victim’s pain, and through it his victim’s body, and make it begin to express the torturer’s will.... Torture does not merely insult or damage its victim’s agency, but rather turns such agency against itself, forcing the victim to experience herself as helpless yet complicit in her own violation. This is not just an assault on or violation of the victim’s autonomy but also a perversion of it, a kind of systematic mockery of the basic moral relations that an individual bears both to others and to herself.

The trams will have wi-fi in due course, it's being fitted to them though only something like three units will have wi-fi enabled when it launches.

No, I don't know why it takes so long to fit wi-fi either.

Honestly, the original justification for the trams (supporting the waterfront development) is out the window, logic and sense are no longer required, just smile and nod as the news comes in.

So what if it's more expensive than the existing comfy airport buses.. it's competing with taxis, and it's cheaper than them!

Every single country was, at some point, made up of smaller independent states and prior to that individual tribes. All now unified into singular entities. From Tribe to County, from County to Country, from Country to continent, eventually culminating in a unified Earth. 

Obviously you have flux where segregation does occur, but overall the trend is, and always has been, pro union. 

Lets use a bit of a far-fetched example. When we eventually encounter other sentient life, do you really think Earth will be divided into separate nations? Do you honestly think the US could be at war with another planet, without every other country being involved in that War? 

This is the basic principal of human societal progression; when your range of travel expands (Mostly due to invention, i.e. Boats, Planes etc), as do your borders. When it takes two hours to get from London to Hong Kong it'll be pretty hard to argue against having 1 unified state for ease of trade and economic development.

- Bring in a new manager to stabilize the team. FdB has the credentials and Pochettino seems to play a style that works well with Tottenham's typical playing style.
- Sell Adebayor. a) he is an expensive player to keep b) he has been an inconsistent performer for many years c) seemed to work well with Sherwood so may not perform in the same way under a different manager d) at 30, he's not very likely to get better and be someone we want in the long run
- Replace Ade. with someone like Jackson Martínez. Bony may also fit the bill if we can take him away from Swansea who unsurprisingly want to keep him. Lukaku is young and has great promise so wold be brilliant if we were to somehow drag him away from Everton's cutches following the new arrival of Costa
- Use the money saved by selling Ade. to make sure Lloris doesn't leave. 
- Bring in a new left back. Personally don't rate Danny Rose after this season (although that may have had more to do with Sherwood's lack of defensive cohesion), Not sure who to replace him with though
- Not make too many other changes. Last season showed us what can happen if you bring in too many players and try and do too much

e.g. ""QED have invested over £900,000 in the development"". 

How much of the £900,000 is the purchasing of the land ro buying the containers? Both will still have value when the container go and another hotel gets built there. How much of this cost is clearing the land or other works that will save money on later developments? 

Is a temporary solution better than a more permanent solution? How about putting the energy into building the desperately needed permanent low cost one bedroom flats in Brighton. Which would not only be good for the homeless but also help bring down the rental prices a bit too. 

It does all smack of making money off the land while waiting for the prices to raise and then trash it and build something more profitable.

Decriminalisation is how Amsterdam dealt with weed, and it's a brilliant system.  You can smoke it, everyone knows, there's no problems, but it's not legal.  If you walk about town smoking a fatty, acting like a gangster and being an arsehole, you'll get nicked for possession - just like you deserve.  Decriminalisation allows for the leniency necessary when dealing with a group of people that range from sensible dudes, to fucking morons.  The sort of range of people you get when you're dealing with an entire country.


Cocaine is good fun, that's no secret.  I'm just aware that I know how to go about doing it 'sensibly', whilst many do not.  That is something I absolutely believe.

Which statistics are you referring to? Again, you seem to be ignoring the fact that knives are used for a plethora of useful things. Guns are made to be shot, that's their sole purpose. They have no other use in society but to be shot. So we can restrict knives all we want, but we're still going to need them. Guns however...nope, we don't gain anything.

However, I think the caliber of player we can realistically sign has changed a lot.  We don't have to look for players to help us get to the champion's league now, we get to look for players who will help us run as deep as possible.  Yes, those are 2 different levels of player in my opinion.

As for Lallana/Kono... I think Lallana is a better player.  You're right that he has proven prem experience and that means a lot. You're also right that Kono is faster and younger. Lallana, however, has better versatility: he's able to play across the front 3 and put in a shift as a CM when needed.  I think he's a harder worker, better defensively/able to play higher pressing, and a more creative player too.  He's the sort of player who isn't afraid to run himself into the ground for his team without a second thought and he makes those around him look good. That kind of player usually ends up becoming even better when he's around higher quality players.  It doesn't particularly matter that he was in L1 4 years ago (2 season EPL, 1 season championship in the past 3 seasons).  Look at Ricky Lambert for my reasoning there.  Or Diego Costa... he was nothing noteworthy until last season and now look at him, he's one of the most feared forward in the world.  Late bloomers happen from time to time and that doesn't diminish their ability when they peak.  Now, I do think we're overpaying for Lallana a bit and I think we could do better than him as well (which I don't like admitting because I like Lallana a lot).  I also agree that we should be looking to fix our fullback situation as our top priority, but I think there's a plan for this summer and if the Lallana bid is true then that's just the beginning of it.

I wouldn't believe for a second that there's a set in stone number that we're allowed to spend this summer.  FSG has never really operated like that when it comes to transfers and has always been adamant that the money is available for the right players. I'm sure they have some amount in mind but if the right deal arises I don't think they'd hesitate to go a bit above it (as we saw with the Willian bid last summer... our reported bid amount would have broken what our suggested budget for the summer was).

I don't see it.

Cahill has been our rock this Season, can you name one game in which he has played poorly? I can't, but I can remember a few games in which Azpi has. Cahill interceps a phenomonal amount of potential goals/crosses, sometimes I'm surprised he even manages to get back and stick a leg out (Terry does the same, but no where near the level Cahill does).

You're right that he has replaced Cole, but that isn't down to perforance alone. Cole was injured and Azpi replaced him (we have no one else who can do the job, not even Kalas, he's said that himself, he's a CB). 

Very rarely does a defender come back from injury to replace another defender that has taken their position and played well, it doesn't happen often at all and it's surprisingly a great way reserve players get their oppurtunity to shine (If you follow the Lower Leagues, it happens quite a bit).

Azpi's been great, but I don't rate him higher than Cole (as a Player, not this Season's performance) and would rather have him playing as a RB.

I'd like to see a proven Champions League CB come if any of our current four go, and definitely one to replace Toure next year when his contract expires. 

The attacking portion of the squad, oddly enough, is where we lack depth most. Having Borini back will be great as he came on leaps and bounds with you over the course of the season. We need a winger and a box-to-box midfielder. We're linked to so many names for both that I don't think it's worth repeating them.

Next year we'll have José Enrique back from his season-long injury. He was sorely missed this season, and resulted in Flanagan having a baptism of fire most weeks. Flanagan will improve with time, and he's a good squad option since he is competent at both full-back roles.

This isn't even close to making anyone rich.  From a purely financial point of view, this is a terrible move.

If you invested £900k in a standard vanguard account, you'd conservatively expect to get approximately 4% return above inflation.

So after 10 years, you'd have a total of:

£900k * 1.04^10 = £1332k

So that's our baseline for comparison.  Any financial scheme that makes less than this is not worth it.

So, let's generously say that 50% of the money invested is in the land, and 50% in consumables.  We'll use their value of £35k profit per year, and say that it grows in line with inflation.  Let's generously say that the land value increases by 5% above inflation. 

So after 10 years you'd have a total of:

£900k * (0.5 * 1.05^10) + £35k * 10 = £1083k

So it's not even close.  If this was a business, I'd shut it down.

&gt; Is a temporary solution better than a more permanent solution?

Do you have a permanent solution that can be done for £900k by a charity?  Or are we just in fantasy land now?

&gt; How about putting the energy into building the desperately needed permanent low cost one bedroom flats in Brighton.

I certainly don't advocate this as a long term solution - but if the only other viable/realistic option was going to be leave the land empty for a few years then I'm glad someone is making a profit out of it as well as helping address the homeless issue. 

I'd love for there to be a more long term fix to the issues faced in Brighton regarding housing, but there really isn't one likely to appear soon and if the option is containers - a fairly bold and innovotive solution that is likely to encounter teething issues - or a fear of doing something wrong and gaining bad press so just leaving the land empty for a few years, then I'd much rather go for the risky but potentially beneficial option.

We wiped out Iraq's air force in a few days, Afghanistan didn't even have one. AWACS, live satellite feeds, and really fucking clever ammunition make it rare that we're within visual range before engaging... these games are more about learning each other's capabilities, learning how to operate together more effectively and technology improvements than Us vs Them engagements.

There are tools that make the stealth capability not-quite-meaningless. Our Typhoons (Eurofighters) have kit on them which can spot the heat of an F22 within ~50Km... now the F22 has missiles it can launch beyond that envelope, unseen, but we'll know about them coming and have time to deal with it. 

Essentially the trade off in air-to-air engagement is this: the closer you get before you fire, the more chance there is of a hit (range depends on weapon type, obviously). So the F22's stealth let's them get pretty close before they're noticed by MOST other aircraft... but the Eurofighter is actually a very nice piece of kit, so we've negated some of that advantage.

Other things result in more death, in aggregate, because they're simply far more common than firearms. That could be seen as a sign that gun control in the UK is a roaring success.

Eh, having said that I'm not hugely against loosening some of the rules, either. If I were to design the gun control laws from scratch, I would likely not make them as restrictive as they are now. My only reason for arguing for the status quo is that at least we know this works and is stable. Any changes have the risk of breaking the current laws and making things significantly worse.

Gun crime has indeed risen slightly since the handgun ban, partially because they changed the way they counter gun crimes. Partially because our borders with the rest of Europe are not as tightly controlled as they once were. Gun crime is rising despite the gun control laws being tightened, that implies that without the tightened gun control they would be even worse than they are now.

Banning guns does not only affect the law abiding, it also severely restricts criminal access to firearms as there are fewer places they can get them. They can no longer steal them from legal owners, for example.

But that isn't what they're complaining about - they're complaining about being called facists - specifically: *“call our supporters fascists, hurl other abuse or any physical assault”*.  Agreed on the physical assault, everything else is just name-calling. 

&gt;Where are the UKIP supporters protesting labour conferences, intimidating those who attend, throwing eggs?

You act like there's no precedent set for this kind of thing, Prescott was egged not too many years ago.  Ignoring that for a second, why do you think other political parties don't attract this kind of thing as much?  UKIP can't be bullish about free speech when they're talking about the ""immigrants""; and then turn around and cry that someone's said nasty things to them.  Live by the sword die by the sword.  

UKIP have no more respect for their opponents than their opponents do for them: *Ahead of the showdown, Ms Atkinson described Brighton as a “hotspot” for anti-fascist activist groups, which “tap into the [Socialist Worker] types that live around there”.*  That's what this type of politics always has been, and always will be, because it's politics of exclusion and blame, not inclusion.  You're always going to be pissing someone off.

I did The Restless Earth, Water On The Land, and The Coastal Zone. 

The Restless Earth was actually quite nice, but the 8 mark question about earthquake preparation was a bit weird, and the first two questions about the link between the deadliest and largest earthquakes was strange.
Water On The Land was just really boring. They just kept asking about levées and there wasn't anything about waterfalls and gorges or meanders or even any kind of erosion in the river. 
The Coastal Zone wasn't too bad either, but a few of the questions, like 'Describe this beach' and 'What is cliff collapse?' and a couple of others were just a bit strange.

true,rydleo,null,null,"For me:

- Sell Enrique.  Supposedly there are few PL sides interested in him.  Won't get much of a fee since he's hardly played, but I'd be okay with that.

- Bring in Erkin as starting LB.  Available on a free and appears a quality player.  I'd bring in Brad Smith as the second choice LB, although obviously Flannagan could always cover there as well if necessary.

- Sell Skrtel.  Seems to be split opinion between he's brilliant and he's awful, but for me he's simply not good enough.

- Bring in a new RCB.  I'd suggest Howedes or Benatia and this is probably where I'd spend a fair amount of coin if I were BR.  Another one I like who wouldn't cost a fortune would be Perrin who's had a very good year although he normally plays on the left.  Added bonus is both Benatia and Perrin speak French.

- For winger/midfielder, I'd bring in Tadic althouugh I'd be okay with Konoplyanka as well.

- Attacking midfielder, I'd get Max Meyer.  The kid will be world class some day I have no doubt and in the mean time he's still pretty damn good.

- I'd keep Johnson for another year until his contract run out, simply because I don't think we could sell him to anyone.  Give Flannagan many run-outs on the right and see how he does.  If he's good enough, then he takes the spot next season full time, if not then we buy another RB next summer.

- Mignolet gets another year as keeper, but I'd bring in a new keeper coach as I don't think Achterberg is very good.

- Borini comes back and is 3rd choice striker, occasional winger.  He would get significant game time for me rotating with Sturridge nearer the end of games as Sturridge's fitness needs to be managed a bit.

End result would be something like:
     
     Mignolet

     Flannagan Benatia Sakho Erkin

First things first, we don't lack width, it just isn't a massive feature of our system. There were times this year, like Chelsea at home, where a player like Konoplyanka would have made a huge difference out wide but saying that, I don't know if he would have won us the game. Unlikely. It's not a concern as you say but I feel now that we have to build for the CL, BR will probably bring in a wide player just to have an option to go that way if needed.

I think we may be forced into playing Flanagan next season again, as much as I'm against it. The RB market is just incredibly dry right now while the LB market has a lot more options. So for LB anyone like Ricardo Rodriguez, Alberto Moreno, Luke Shaw or Fabio Coentrao would be ideal! Johnson has to go, he doesn't offer much more than Flanno but his wages are probably 10 times higher. Either Agger or Skrtel will go too, not sure which one. Hopefully Skrtel goes but it doesn't look like BR is too keen on the Agger-Sakho partnership. Not sure what CB we'll bring in, maybe Caulker. I also can't wait to see Ilori next year, he looks very good and his style matches up with Sakho's so well. Btw, Sakho is fucking boss.

When it comes to midfield I still think we need a DM, some absolutely tough as nails hard bastard. Saw Mascherano rumours today which I would absolutely love but it has to be taken with a pinch of salt. Someone like Lars Bender or Yann M'Vila would also be fantastic. There were links to Javi Martinez the last day too but I don't believe it...would be a sensational signing though! It would be great to get Lallana in. Of course he's overpriced but he would be a good signing nonetheless. I find it funny that Liverpool fans are complaining about us splashing out on an attacker...compare this to last summer!

Up front is more or less sorted. I hope Aspas goes because he isn't doing himself or us any favours by sticking around. I would loooove to get Borini back. I've always liked this guy and he'd be a great guy off the bench which is something we lacked this year. Sturridge does get injured quite frequently so we need an extra option. Rodgers said a couple of months ago he wanted Borini back but that statement seemed to slip under the radar.

All in all, it's a great time to be a Liverpool fan, our squad is only going to get better and our manager just won LMA Manager of the Year AND he's close to signing a new contract.

If they provide a good or service people value and desire, their jobs will still exist. Demand creates jobs, not corporations. 

I daresay it would be nice if there were more, ahem, 'British companies for British people', founded, headquartered and paying tax in the UK. In that event they might be a little more interested in what happens to people here rather than the money that floods out of the country into the pockets of shareholders. Employing people, building and maintaining infrastructure, investment in technology; nothing that Vodafone or Starbucks or any of these other companies do is motivated by generosity. It's all based on expected returns. If Starbucks didn't expect to win back customers by moving their European HQ to the UK, they sure as hell wouldn't be doing it.

&gt; for the glory of the revolution.

Gratuitous ad hominem.

That said, it's  ""One point awarded for every £4 spent in each purchase transaction (£4min)"" - so the more you use it, the more you make. (1 point = 1p). 

Then there are the bonuses for insurance etc... I guess it depends how much you spend monthly and what you're after. 

Personally, I'm not that well off, so I save the vouchers for when I'm really skint (normally around Dec. tbh, madam's birthday is right before xmas) and it's a tank or two of petrol, or some presents, or.... whatever.

 [**Time dilation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time%20dilation): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;In the [theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity), __time dilation__ is an actual difference of elapsed time between two [events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_(relativity\)) as measured by [observers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_(special_relativity\)) either moving relative to each other or differently situated from gravitational masses.

&gt;An accurate clock at rest with respect to one observer may be measured to tick at a different rate when compared to a second observer's own equally accurate clocks. This effect arises neither from technical aspects of the clocks nor from the fact that signals need time to propagate, but from the nature of [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime) itself.


&gt;====

&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/wdOLtQ0.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Soyuz_TMA-1_at_the_ISS.jpg) - *Time dilation explains why two working clocks will report different times after different accelerations. For example, ISS astronauts return from missions having aged slightly less than they would have been if they had remained on Earth, and GPS satellites work because they adjust for similar bending of spacetime to coordinate with systems on Earth.

true,Roods,England,Hertfordshire - '07 GSXR 600,"Rest assured your confidence will increase after a crash, it just takes time and miles. 

Saying that, I found that being analytical about why I crashed helped immensely. If you can pick apart what went wrong you can start to learn how to avoid crashing in future. A few pointers:

* Relax and don't tense up - being tense &amp; tight on the throttle doesn't help the bike corner (quite the opposite in fact). Nervousness is natural after having a crash but just keep reminding yourself that the more nervous and tense you are, the more likely you'll have an accident!

* Look as far through the corner as possible - is there gravel/diesel/potholes on the approach? Does the road tighten up? Are there any hidden side roads? I remember someone here saying that 'looking up the road is like seeing into the future'; the further you can see, the earlier you can anticipate any potential problems and the more confidence that provides.

Ultimately being critical (but not negative) of your riding technique will help you overcome your fear after coming off, and in the long run will make you a better rider.

The main thing is you've already taken the hardest step which is getting back on the bike. Good luck!

Tiredbusy day. Woke up at 3.30am, got back to sleep at 4.30am, somehow made it into work in super quick time (for me anyway) and even early; had a gazillion deadlines of uber urgent work, most of which are things my boss should be doing but is not. Nouser is discovering that whilst not being forced to share an office with a burpy annoying thing is nice, being situated opposite my boss is NOT.

Dinner's cooking and then I've got a couple of hours of work to do :(

A friend is miscarrying which makes me really sad because it took quite a lot of effort to find a donor and she's just turned 40 so she's kinda desperate. Saw her yesterday and she looked awful. I know so little about pregnancy that there's not much I can say to reassure her, and if I tell her what another mate has said she may be even more freaked out... so. I've been feeling kind of down for her.

Another bad thing: one of my BFFs is going fucking crazy on Ambien again. He scares me when he's on it. I don't know how to get him to stop. He lives in the States so distance is a bit of a problem.

We live in a democratic society. Our form of government is a constitutional monarchy, they are not mutually exclusive concepts. 

&gt;it is not democratic that people are silenced for publicly stating what they think is the truth

I didn't say they should be. If they stand across the street, away from the people trying to get into the meetings, there is no problem. When they try to barge into the meeting, or insult and shout at the people trying to get in to an intimidating level, then they are no longer protesting, they are preventing people from having the freedom to go about their business, and hold whatever political view they wish. 


&gt;How come the only people protected from 'intimidation' are UKIP supporters?

They are not.

&gt;some people see the rise of far right nationalist groups in this country as a threat, and find their rhetoric and promises very intimidating, should UKIP members be arrested for assault for saying things I don't like?

That is not the definition of assault.

We are not talking about a right to not be offended.

From http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/policy/army/fm/fm34-52/chapter1.htm

&gt;PROHIBITION AGAINST USE OF FORCE
The use of force, mental torture, threats, insults, or exposure to unpleasant and inhumane treatment of any kind is prohibited by law and is neither authorized nor. condoned by the US Government. Experience indicates that the use of force is not necessary to gain the cooperation of sources for interrogation. Therefore, the use of force is a poor technique, as it yields unreliable results, may damage subsequent collection efforts, and can induce the source to say whatever he thinks the interrogator wants to hear. However, the use of force is not to be confused with psychological ploys, verbal trickery, or other nonviolent and noncoercive ruses used by the interrogator in questioning hesitant or uncooperative sources.

http://www.sagepub.com/press/2012/march/SAGE_InterrogationalTorture.sp

&gt;John W. Schiemann, author of the study and a political scientist at Fairleigh Dickinson University, found that information gleaned from interrogational torture is very likely to be unreliable, and when torture techniques are employed, they are likely to be used too frequently and too harshly. Furthermore, he found that for torture to generate even small amounts of valuable information in practice, the State must make the rational calculation to torture innocent detainees for telling the truth in order to maintain torture as a threat against those who withhold information.

http://www.cgu.edu/pdffiles/sbos/costanzo_effects_of_interrogation.pdf

&gt;many survivors of torture report that the truthful information they revealed was intentionally incomplete or mixed with false information (Harbury, 2005). The goal was to appease the torturer, not to reveal the truth.

&gt;there is irrefutable evidence from the civilian criminal justice system that techniques much less coercive than torture have produced verifiably false confessions in a surprising number of cases.
