My post

&gt; It could also be suggested that

Now my point is that is undeniably true.  If you don't have a flap of skin, there is no way things can get trapped there.  Things will get trapped, it requires a significant amount of water to clean, I can certainly shower a lot faster.  However, there is more the CDC for instance:

&gt;[Several types of research have documented that male circumcision significantly reduces the risk of men contracting HIV through penile-vaginal sex.](http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/prevention/research/malecircumcision/)

Now myself, I don't consider that a reason, as the probability of contracting HIV that way is so tiny, it's a change in a tiny chance, there are downsides after all.  But the point still remains, there are some undeniable benefits.  They might not be worth the price, I'm not saying it should be done on mass.  Just compared to FGM.

When you consider that over 1% of the male population (according to my consultant) have to have surgical measures for phimosis, I consider that to be by far the biggest plus.  Then again, I'm biased, thanks to the awful NHS by the time I had surgery it was so bad I had to have three more operations, including effectively a pee-hole enlargement, that was painful enough, and left me addicted to painkillers for about a year.

I fully expect that my outlying experiences should not mandate anyone has such procedures routinely.

But my point is compare and contrast this to FGM, which AFIAK has absolutely no medical benefits to anything, only downsides.

You understand that comparing such things to chopping off an ear, is incredibly rude to someone who has suffered through such an illness, because it simply isn't the same.  The purpose a foreskin serves?  What have I lost having it removed?  I suffered a secondary infection which would be less likely to happen if I had been an infant, the follow on surgeries also would not have been needed had surgery been used sooner, the effect on an infant is less than as an adult.

So this is why, loosing a foot, a lung, that's absurd because the difference is huge.  I can tell you graphically about the differences if you want.  I can also talk about the effects of the scar tissue too.  One big problem I've been left with is that unless it's a high end brand of condom, I will most probably not climax during sex.  So I am well, well aware of these issues, probably far more so than you are.  I also think it would be disingenuous to compare it to say appendix removal, as the downsides of that, in my mind anyway, are less than that of circumcision.

&gt;You had an issue with a body part and got medical attention

So if my girl friend told me she is pregnant with a boy, do you think I should consider circumcision?  There is a lot of research that says the chances are higher genetically.  It's hard for me to weigh the downsides of a babies experience, but I can tell you, I would happily give up the sexual pleasure loss, for the 6 months of agony.  This is decision I might one day have to try and make.  FGM never has such choices, this is the point I've been trying to make.  In all honesty, I will defer that decision to the best expert I can get some time with, I am in no way qualified to make such a decision, but you know what, I don't want some ignorant people on reddit limiting what my expert can suggest.",0,1406058957,null,0,false,0,cj4rd2y,t3_2bdn6w,t1_cj4rd2y,t1_cj4qqna,null,1434845799,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Up to half of the locally-trained players must be from the club itself, with the others being either from the club itself or from other clubs in the same association.

So Rekik will have been with us for 5 years upon turning 21 and Lopes will have been with us for 4 years upon turning 21.  This means that **both** of them qualify as both homegrown and locally-trained.",0,1406059453,null,0,false,0,cj4rngk,t3_2bf61u,t1_cj4rngk,t1_cj4qds4,null,1434845920,11,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,11

My insurance is approximately 2 and a half grand though I'm paying it monthly. You'll also have to consider breakdown cover (some insurance policies may have this included, MOT, road tax, and petrol (my 1.0l engine can get filled up for about £30-40 but  drive long distances to work so a full tank doesn't always last a month).

This, adjusted for inflation is now £99.18 (approx 168 USD). And I'll be honest, it wasn't the best game in the world. It only had 5 levels. I can now download that game for an emulator in less than two seconds for free, and I'll tell you this much, I would never have paid that much had I known what the game was like beforehand. 

Despite that, the company still went bust in 1991, because their games weren't good enough, and I feel like I was raped by Michael Jackson too. 

Fast-forward a few years and the PS1 came around, and those lucky few knew how to get 'chipped games'. That's when I got my first copies of GTA, Tekken, Abe's exodus, MGS and more. Don't get me wrong, I got some crap games too. all for the princely sum of £5 a piece. (3 for £10). Without piracy I would have never played those games, and become attached to their mythos, characters and style of play. Now that I'm older, and I know what I like with regards to older franchises. I know to look beyond flashy marketing or a gimmick, because it doesn't mean a damn thing. And if I'm unconvinced by the demo, then I'll absolutely pirate it and have a proper go. 

I had a pirated copy of morrowind for PC (didn't have an xbox original), but when Oblivion came out for the 360, I bought it legit. then when the GOTY came out, I got that too, same with skyrim (collectors and legendary, then legendary for PC), and fallout (original and GOTY, 360 and PC), FNV (original and Ultimate for xbox and PC) and Dishonored (not as good, 360 only). I estimate that all in, I've paid easily over £500 on bethesda games alone. Because Bethesda make awesome games.

true,Snoron,cnty-england,Bradford,"Thanks for the well measured response, but you're still erring on the side of saying something that is absolutely inhumane when done for religious and cultural reasons is okay because of unrelated things such as cleanliness and other possible conditions.

First let us consider: Even if there were no cleanliness issues or possible medical issues, these religious people would *still* want to do this for the same reason they do it for now: because ""God told them to"". Keep that in mind when you consider the actual reasons and purposes behind this.

Sorry to use more perhaps ridiculous examples, but when you bring up the genetic part, again I just feel like you're taking your personal situation and trying to apply it to everyone in an illogical way.

People have breasts removed to pre-empt a genetic disposition to breast cancer. And yet again no one today would a) use that to justify pre-empting this in a baby, or b) use it to justify that other people do this for religious reasons because ""there are positive aspects to it"".

And hell, this chance is a lot higher than 1% for some people! Breast cancer is an order of magnitude more likely, and more deadly.

If you think you're using statistics and logic to come to your conclusion then you are fooling yourself - your personal experience has warped your view of the issue entirely, I can promise you that. Hell, if this had never happened to you, but you knew it was a 1% probability for your son, I can pretty much guarantee that you wouldn't even be considering this at all right now. So turn that over in your mind for a moment. And think how someone who isn't you will view this. Hell, even how your son would view this if not through parent-tinted-spectacles.

Medical issues are apart and aside to all of this entirely - if medical issues exist or extremely high genetic predispositions exist, causing this procedure to be heavily recommended (or even mandated!) by a specialist then that is fine.

But the problem with this is that it's a procedure that you are *legally* allowed to have carried out even when it's not necessary... this automatically makes the discussion possible at times when it shouldn't even be possible to speak to a specialist about it in the first place. I will explain.

Consider: If circumcision had no cultural or religious backing and if it wasn't a practise that was acceptable to people already, then it would be illegal. And you would not even be able to go and speak to a specialist about this in the first place with all medical aspects being *exactly* as they are right now. If there was no historic acceptance of this, you would probably be paid a visit from social services and perhaps face a police investigation for even bringing up this idea with a doctor.

The only reason this isn't the case is due to the history and religious protections. It does not mesh in any way whatsoever with any other regulations and ways of thinking we have today about medical issues in the developed world.

But we live in a world that has an absolutely skewed perspective on this issue due to it being so widely carried out. If that wasn't the case it would NEVER become the case any more than any of the ridiculous examples and analogies I have proposed thus far would ever spontaneously become popular. So you are making all these decisions inside a culture bubble where you begin with a choice that is legally acceptable, when the reality should be that you do not.

I understand the want for risk-aversion, and issues you've had with the NHS. But given the probability in the first place, the irreversibility, and the chance of issues *due* to it being done, it is not an acceptable thing to be doing to a baby any more than any other forced body modification for any similar reasons.

You believe it to be within your right to make this decision. I believe that the law should absolutely prevent you from it without medical necessity.

You believe that it is a right you should have because of religious and cultural precedent that has kept it legal. I believe that we should be ethically consistent with our approach to medicine and that we should ignore the religious and cultural aspects - if we did, then this would not be legal.

Also, I don't mean to be rude, but perhaps I am being almost on purpose, if it came across that way. I am quite literally telling you that something you would do to your offspring should be illegal. There's not really much way to say this to someone without it sounding rude, I suppose?",0,1406060807,null,0,false,0,cj4sfxx,t3_2bdn6w,t1_cj4sfxx,t1_cj4rd2y,null,1434846475,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

For me that's the problem. I'm not much of a music person (never have been) but I like TV content. I'm not a fan of streaming (bandwidth bottlenecks, lousy experiences with crap software) and even then I'm told that what Netflix offers in the UK is pretty sub-par compared to across the pond.

So for the moment I tend to download TV content. I'm not too concerned about when I watch things, with the exception of hugely high profile shows (to avoid the entire internet spoiling key plot points - ugh). From what I've seen TV shows are still offered on DVDs. I don't own anything that can even play DVDs any more and as such find the notion of paying for content that way to be laughably silly.

I'd love to build a library of content in the style of a Steam library - along with the bundles and sales that one finds in a system that embraces the notion of near-zero marginal cost. According to Steam I have 364 games. The last game I pirated was a Windows version of Guitar Hero. Even then that was just to see if a second hand controller I bought works! (I'm saving up for an Xbox 360 but peripherals are the trickier thing to get hold of - gotta grab 'em when they appear on the second hand shelf!)

Before Steam's rise to prominence I would pirate games left and right. Keeping track of the files, cracks, ISOs, discs, and patches was a constant hassle. I'm overjoyed to be able to pay a reasonable sum and have all that stuff handled for me.

I think that fairly illustrates my willingness to pay for content - assuming it's delivered in a way that actually works for me. My point was mostly that a lot of piracy, I'd hazard an unsourced guess at the majority, is of TV content. It's not currently available in a way that suits people apparently. Streaming works for some people but for others, especially those of us who like building collections of content, streaming doesn't fit.",0,1406061235,null,0,false,0,cj4sotl,t3_2bdnb2,t1_cj4sotl,t1_cj4kuz4,null,1434846642,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

If someone under 18 (and not married to their partner) takes an ""indecent photograph"" of themselves and send it to their partner, both can potentially be prosecuted for the manufacture of indecent images of children.

If they're married, only the person in the photo can be prosecuted - the other is safe unless they are going to show the image to someone else.

There's also case law that says that it is the *image* that has to be indecent, not the child. So an indecent image that happens to have someone under 18 in it (in the background, for example), could be illegal.

And there's no statutory definition or guide for what counts as ""indecent.""

And in a recent case the CPS assumed the person in the photo was under 18 because they looked it, and that the jury would get to decide, rather than taking any steps to verify that the person was over 18 (which they were, and the defence managed to prove shortly before the case when to trial, leading to it being dropped).",0,1406061557,null,0,false,0,cj4svix,t3_2bfg42,t1_cj4svix,t3_2bfg42,null,1434846680,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

We're talking about all creativity because that's what your assertion covered:

&gt;You do realise that if we were to apply this logic more rigorously, people would just not make anything

People would make things because the urge to be creative is a strong one. They might not do it as much as if they were getting paid for it but money is not what fuels creativity it merely enables it.

&gt;If someone makes something to be enjoyed and doesn't want money for it

That's not what either of us were saying. Money is a factor but it isn't the underlying cause of creativity.

&gt;If you want compensation from those who enjoy and use your creation, you deserve that.

I get a bit hazy when we start using words like ""deserve"" and ""morally right/morally wrong"". It's all really, really subjective.

If you'd phrased it like this then we wouldn't have that issue:

&gt;It seems like everyone wins if you can negotiate a business model wherein those who enjoy and use your creation pay you a mutually agreed sum.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt; Thanks for the well measured response, but you're still erring on the side of saying something that is absolutely inhumane when done for religious and cultural reasons is okay because of unrelated things such as cleanliness and other possible conditions.

Woh!  I'm not saying it's ok for religious reasons!  I hope I'm not coming off that way.  Seriously, I understand that 2000 years ago having pork might be a health hazard, but today I've Waitrose and a love my bacon!

&gt; And hell, this chance is a lot higher than 1% for some people! Breast cancer is an order of magnitude more likely, and more deadly.

The problem is, by trying to draw an anology, you miss the point entirely.  Whilst my glorious nob is in some medical books, I can tell you it was horrific.  I've broken bones, spent months in braces, had a tooth pulled sans anesthetic, attempted to put stitches in a wound I cut out myself (spider bite, plus I was drunk) hell last year I fractured my arm and I didn't realise it until I just couldn't eat with chopsticks.  I've a high pain threshold, so the poly nurse politely put it.  I hope my candidness is taken for what it is, this isn't some bragging bullshit, I became an addict to painkillers.  I would pass out frequently.  The pain was so bad.  Most peoples 10, I don't think is really a 10.  I've taken a scaple to my arm and not winced, this would make my body give up.  You can't compare that.

Now let's continue comparing what we can't compare.  Take a famous actress not so long ago, she had a double mastectomy because of the risk of something happening.  I'm not saying to do it on mass, just that medical professionals should really consider it.  This is important because consider it in the context of your remark

&gt;But the problem with this is that it's a procedure that you are legally allowed to have carried out even when it's not necessary

Who decides.  That is the issue I have there.

&gt;You believe that it is a right you should have because of religious and cultural precedent that has kept it legal. I believe that we should be ethically consistent with our approach to medicine and that we should ignore the religious and cultural aspects - if we did, then this would not be legal.

No not at all, because I'm a libertarian, I believe everything should be legal until we realise it's dangerous.  At uni a house mates friend was putting in ear lobe embiggeners, these I thought were stupid, but it's his right to injure himself, one day, when having a BBQ, I noticed one of his lobes was badly, badly infected.  He had a bit of a problem, but doing so is his choice.  I don't think we need to legislate against it.  Mutilating your child for religious beliefs, it's a tough one, because there are some benefits, what happens to future me?  I get the best expert I think I can find, but someone disagrees, someone I've never met says *oh you could be doing this because you are a religious idiot* and so suddenly another expert, one I consider less qualified, says it's not required.  What happens?  Who has the say?

For me, as I'll say again, I'm uniquely aware of the impact it's had on me, if anyone is curious, I can try and explain in detail, but there have been some, but they are so minor, they don't really effect me.  I've known perfectly healthy girls who can only cum under specific positions etc, having such downsides isn't really a big deal.  I had sex before (very, very poorly, as I was young!) and I've had a lot later, hell the psychological factor probably pushed me to do so, I stopped counting after 30 different partners, which I accept given my only one long term relationship, not a healthy point, but anyway, I'm functional to say the least.  The downside really, really isn't that bad.  Compared to FGM, all I can say is what's wrong with people, it's nothing alike. 

So given the fact there are some upsides, I worry about how people rally against it, I also worry, maybe because of my age, that we don't teach boys enough about this.  When I was in primary school only the girls got any real sex ed.

This to me is the point, if you have someone say not committing murder because its a 10 commandment, that's fine by me, granted I don't murder people because I have self defined ethics, but whatever, the outcome is the same.  This is why I find FGM to be a good order of magnitude worse than male, I've been through it at possibly the worst age, the outcome wasn't *that* bad, read a report on FGM and fuck, I'd rather be circumcised over and over than face that.  I worry so many people lack the perspective on the difference.  It's important.  Because we can start on FGM then look at religious ideology around males, it's more important to stop FGM than male circumcision in my book, by far.

Also have a check of [this site](http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Leicester_City/Leicester_City.htm) where you can see every kit the team has played in, as well as how our badge evolved throughout the years.

Secondly I'd say to keep an eye on the [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/LCFCOfficial) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/lcfcofficial) pages to keep up to date with official things. The YouTube channel is great for interaction with the players.

Also a few videos I've found if you have time:

[Glory Days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T800Ters31M) - Our Martin O'Neill era. 

[Between the wars 1919-1939](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJzCqnbOy9w)

[Tour of the King Power Stadium from 2008](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZBPqVH7YWI)

I'm sure there's millions more I've missed but those are interesting. I'll keep adding when I see some more.

Where to watch us play: 

Most games will now be on TV, due to the popularity of the Premier League. There is an exception of League Cup and FA Cup games, unless we get quite far in it. 

The best site to use is Wiziwig in my opinion, there should be multiple websites streaming the games in decent quality. We should also have Match Threads in /r/soccer and someone will post a link or two! I am aware that in America you can watch every game in the premiership?

As you probably remember, in 2006 Nadia Eweida was placed on unpaid leave by BA after refusing to cover up her cross. She lost in her Employment Tribunal, Employment Tribunal Appeal, and at the Court of Appeal, leading to weeks of front page stories criticising the rulings, with lots of stuff along the lines of 'I bet if she was a foreign religion she would have been fine'. 

She ended up taking the case to the European Court of Human Rights, and won! However, after that, there was essentially crickets from the media. Surely the ECHR had stood up for British culture, yet the media largely ignored it for your typical 'ECHR erodes British values' baloney. 

And that's what we're dealing with. Many people who oppose the ECHR don't oppose it for any sane reasons, they seems to ignore the multitude of reasonable cases even the most ardent Telegraph reader couldn't shout down, they'd rather hear the minority of scare stories and use it as justification to remove Human Rights.

I tip at a sit down restaurant if the service is quality, if it is not, no tip.

my cabbie's always get tipped, but that's simply so that when I'm on the last train back, all of them want me over whoever else is at the station - I don't even have to tell them where to go, which is excellent some times.

Then the shop put their price up to £9. Of course, almost nobody is going to carry on tipping £1.50, it would just be odd. In fact, they started giving people the change as two 50p coins, I guess previously some people tipped 50p rather than £1.50.

England was generally OK, but their perception of our country was skewed. Most of them seemed to think it was some sort of war-torn hellhole like Afghanistan. I was honestly asked by an English teacher if we feared for our lives while we were out shopping over here.

Scotland has an inferiority complex with England, or at least the people I met living near Edinburgh did. This could also be due to Braveheart coming out around that time. I specifically remember being told that ""England owned Northern Ireland, but didn't own Scotland"" as well as ""I hate the English more than you do"" and then a long set of follow up questions when I revealed I didn't hate the English as such.

Can't really comment on Wales. The guys I did meet from there seemed pretty chill but I guess I may as well dislike them along with the rest of the UK.

For the record I identify as ""Northern Irish Only"" and I would guess I am technically Unionist but only because I feel that being part of the UK is the safer bet in terms of Economy plus I like knowing the NHS has my back.

I'm happy to go in to detail if it educates and will reduce the risk of other people suffering, but alas my GF and her ring flash are not here tonight, so best I can do is a phone pic, I will however, dedicate it to you if you wish.

Interesting bit to also note is the old pee hole that had to be recute, due to the intensity of the condition whilst the alternatives were being tried.

I was an asthmatic already taking a prednisolone too much, so they simply tried using a series of topical steroid creama, I can't recall which ones, but I can recall the awkwardness of being told to wank more.  In front of my parents...

They tried some laser thing too but that did jack shit.

So eventually I ended up getting cut.  Then It was infected, the surgen who did it, didn't do it well, so I went under agian.  That time it was the chief consultant of a major hospital doing it, he noticed something he didn't like, a camera confirmed, there was internal issues created by the pressure.

So I went under a third time to get a larger hole made, this was horrifically painful, it was about 6 months until I could pee without fainting.  To give you an idea of my pain threshold, so you know I'm not a pansy, I've fractured my elbow (radial head) and not realised (couldn't use chopsticks, was out with an ex for dinner, she and her new partner are boths quacks and realised immediately), I've given myself a stitch after cutting away effected skin on my arm.

true,Snoron,cnty-england,Bradford,"&gt;&gt;Thanks for the well measured response, but you're still erring on the side of saying something that is absolutely inhumane when done for religious and cultural reasons is okay because of unrelated things such as cleanliness and other possible conditions.
&gt;
&gt;Woh! I'm not saying it's ok for religious reasons! I hope I'm not coming off that way. Seriously, I understand that 2000 years ago having pork might be a health hazard, but today I've Waitrose and a love my bacon!

I think you're misunderstanding what I mean about this a bit - and similarly with the bit later, here:

&gt; You believe that it is a right you should have because of religious and cultural precedent that has kept it legal. I believe that we should be ethically consistent with our approach to medicine and that we should ignore the religious and cultural aspects - if we did, then this would not be legal.

I'm not saying that you are justifying it due to religious protections or reasons. But I am making a (bold) claim that if it wasn't for those factors being in existence, there would be almost no probability that you would be supporting it now. *Even after* what you've been through. And yes it sounds absolutely horrific, I doubt I can even imagine how bad it was, and maybe I don't really want to either!

But absolutely everything about the world today suggests that I am right - no one would ever allow something like this to *become* legal, it only is for historic reasons, and following that it's the only reason people such as you are able to have formed an opinion like this when you wouldn't agree with the other examples. I'd even go as far as to say that that would be the case if you'd had a similar issue with another body part.

To address everything else, anyway:

The libertarian argument is kind of irrelevant. We're not talking about people doing things with consent here. I'm all for people doing whatever the hell they want *to themselves* or to others with proper consent. But we're talking about doing something to a defenseless baby. Now I would *guess* that you wouldn't support some libertarian right of any parents to be allowed to do whatever they want to their baby? I mean, if you do then that's fine and another argument entirely and we'll just stop this discussion right there, because it's completely encircled within another set of beliefs entirely. But that doesn't seem to be the case, anyway!

The argument about FGM is also irrelevant. One crime being worse than another doesn't mean you shouldn't tackle that crime. If both were illegal then both should be fought. Sure there should be more money and effort put into the worse ones, but you take them up as they are being committed. You don't stop working on rape cases or dismiss it as unimportant simply because there's murders and murderers out there!

So if someone wants a double mastectomy as you mentioned that's fine for them to elect to have that operation. But what if she decided to have that operation carried out on her infant daughter who also carried the same risk? Would people be praising her as a hero and inspiration like when she had it done herself? No, she'd be considered an absolutely barbaric monster - and rightly so!

So looping back again, I'm simply claiming that you would see this situation as being similar to that one if it wasn't for the historic aspect. I don't know if you've spent time trying to think out of our culture bubble, but just consider logically all of the laws we have about these sorts of things, and if this had never been legal at any point in history what would happen if someone just suggested this today based on the arguments you have put forward.

It depends what that ""just starting out"" person is doing. If it's just photography/photo editing then you're right, £9 a month is nothing and even with Illustrator added on it's less than you'd spend on cigarettes a month.

As for me - I'm essentially starting out, as I haven't done any series design-related work for a good few years now. I use Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign regularly, and am now branching out in to video - which means I also use After Effects and Premiere Pro. Really I need the full suite. I get by just fine for the most part with CS4 - but, particularly with video editing, CS6 is much more powerful and versatile. I haven't upgraded yet because my PC can't handle it; when I do, though, I really doubt I'm going to be able to justify the cost of upgrading to CC.

Forgive me for picking out one such strand, but seriously, not it shouldn't.

I run a small firm, we have to choose wisely how to allocate our resources.  You have to prioritise things, we had to endure horrific temps because we didn't have the cash flow for an AC unit.  You would never expect a multi-million pound company to ever have to make such simply choices, but I did.

FGM for me, is an order of magnitude, a deviation away, from the issues that male circumcision has.

This is mostly what I want to emphasis.  Men get some benefit from it.  It's minor and not worth doing to all (in my mind!) but there is at least the room for debate..

FGM, from what I know, lacks any merit.  No *good* at all.

This is why I really dislike relating the two.  It isn't due to history, it isn't due to one religious pratice being more mainstream than the other.

You can also look at the veins  if they are green you'll be warmer toned, blue means cooler toned.

It's not a foolproof method and the best way is to read up on undertones. Do also remember if you struggle with self help methods that you could also be neutral/olive which means you are in the middle.

I think a good place to start would be YSL - they do 3 ranges of their Teint Touche Eclat - B - neutral, BR - pink tones, BG - yellow tones. It also runs fairly pale. If you go to a YSL counter, I find the John Lewis ladies are a little more generous with samples.

Now, when picking a team, it depends what you're looking for. My favorite team is the Chicago Bulls (I live in Missouri, which isn't really ""close"" to any major NBA teams, Chicago is near and I have family there). The NBA is similar to the EPL in the way that big teams seem to win every year, but there're underdog winners occasionally which makes the game so fun to watch.

Here's my list when introducing someone to New Who, along with the sidenotes and bonuses:


""Hello, and welcome to my Doctor Who introduction! \o/

I tried to find 5 episodes that you could watch without any major spoiler, in chronological order so that you don't get mixed up in the regenerations, and interesting enough to make you want to see more.
Give it a try.
If after 5 episodes you're still around, chances are we'll be having geeky and *very* cool conversations pretty soon!


* The Empty Child / The Doctor dances 
(this will introduce you to the general ambiance of the show, and is a good mix of how this show can be both scary and very funny at the same time)
* New Earth
(for a lot of aliens, space travel, and generally cool stuff)
* The Shakespeare Code
(so that you can discover the past, after the future, and discover why sometimes a little kitsch is okay. Bonus points for some cool crossover... I'll buy you a drink if you can mention in to me in one word afterwards!)
* Blink
(This is seriously one of the best episodes EVER. It will show you that even without the main character, the series still has a soul. And it is very, very cool.)
* The Eleventh hour
(so that you can understand the ""regeneration"" process better, and have fun while the ""new"" doctor is cooking!)


Also included in this file, are three ""bonus"" episodes:

* Dalek (where you can understand that this show has a lot of history, and get a glimpse of its past, as well as a revival of old monsters and a little drama, it adds depth to the characters but I couldn't include it as a ""must-see"" in just 5 episodes)
*  The girl in the Fireplace (so you can discover cool monsters, and get to see that Time Travel can be pretty cool!)
* Silence in the Library / Forest of the dead (so you can discover other cool monsters, and that Time Travel can also be pretty messy.) 



Normally, if after watching the five first episodes, you're not that into it, then no worry, I don't think you have to endure anymore, it's not a show for you. Which is still cool, we'll have loads of other stuff to talk about, maybe that show that we both fangirl about isn't out yet? Also, thank you for taking the time to watch this, it means a lot to me. Thanks a lot.

If you're still here, great! If those five episodes gave you a little hunger for more, watch the bonuses included by yours truly.


... And if you're still here.... AWESOME! \o/
Congratulations, you might just have what it takes to become a Whovian! &lt;3
Come over, let's watch some Who, I'll bake a little treat (with custard!), and we'll have some fun!
(Also if you're really into it I have the whole 30ish seasons, so... Just gimme a call and I'll come over with my external Hard drive.)

In the town itself you have the old walls which are worth a good walk around, they have information boards up explaining everything. 

Nearby are Berwick Barracks, I'm a bit of a bore when it comes to stuff like this but it's not all about the military as they have a really cool room on what Berwick was like through the years with a model street. The military history behind Berwick is fascinating and with the Scottish Referendum coming up it adds a bit of a different dimension to it. 

You have two old bridges connecting the two sides of Berwick and one is a train line with a few castle ruins at one end.

Lowry painted a lot of Berwick, though these aren't his most famous works, so there's a trail you can go on to see the sights he painted. Think small cobbled streets and the like. 

If you head upstream there is the Union Bridge, also known as the Chain Bridge. Crossing that bridge crosses the border and has a walk that leads you back into Berwick. Near here is Paxton Hall which is great and in the immediate area the West of Berwick are ruined castles like Norham and Etal. Flodden is nearby also.

The Scottish economy has a number of challenging constraining factors and so if their GDP is higher than the economically efficient south of England in particular, then how are the accomplishing it... They might argue with oil - but as many people have said the nature of oil profitability and ownership is far from certain.   

It also stands to reason, that whilst independence might open up new areas for economic expansion in Scotland **in the mid-long term**, in the short term it will probably cause a hit to Scottish GDP as some companies relocate their registered tax base and main operations to the rUK... Plus the inevitable battle over currency and borrowing rates.

He spoke about the new signings as well. I've added some excerpts below.

On Rickie Lambert:
&gt;He's a proper man, a good guy. He's 32, but he's very fit and is going to really offer us something in the games this season, both when he plays and coming off the bench - something different that we don't have. He's really strong in the air, but he's got a great touch and has a lovely feel for the ball. He's someone I'm really looking forward to working with. He's fitted into the group really well.

On Adam Lallana:
&gt;Adam Lallana, as you'd expect, is a wonderful talent and we've seen that over the last couple of years in the Premier League.

&gt;I've watched him since he was a young player and I've seen his progression. In this very short period of time of working with him, I've realised what a good man he is. We do our homework on the players, on their character, before they come in. He's a great human being, he's here because he's hungry and wants to fight for Liverpool.

On Emre Can:
&gt;Emre Can is again another exciting young player. I watched him quite a bit last year in Germany and he played in a number of positions. I think the only positions he didn't play for Bayer Leverkusen were in goal and centre forward!

On Lazar Markovic:
&gt;Young Markovic is a really exciting talent. He's the kind of player I like, who can beat people in one versus one [situations]. He's good in the duel, but he also works hard - so he doesn't just run forward quickly, he runs back even quicker, which is important.",0,1406068516,null,0,false,0,cj4womu,t3_2bftf8,t1_cj4womu,t3_2bftf8,null,1434848510,10,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,10

I read the judgement from the cases, from my recollection, I believe they noted that basically no other developed country, including the typically harsh American system, had whole life sentences with no possibility of reform. They also noted that those who had whole-life tariffs previously had a right to have their case reviewed in the UK. It was a tweaking of the system which removed that right, almost by accident. Further, they noted that it left no incentive for the prisoner to reform ppm their ways; if you can never be released, why would you change or improve yourself? These reasons, and many others, were the basis of the ruling. 

In the grand scheme of things, this only effects tens of prisoners. It's such a minor thing I don't understand why it became such a ridiculous issue. ",0,1406068572,null,0,false,0,cj4wpo0,t3_2bfhm0,t1_cj4wpo0,t1_cj4uh6u,null,1434848522,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

And I do not think we are trading away the team. Michu gone is probably better in the long run, his ankles probably wont hold up long term. So any cash we can get out of him is great. Pablo has been wildly inconsistent. Vorm's form has been slipping since his first season and I don't think he's as good as everyone thinks he is. I know everyone likes Davies because he's a local lad and showed a lot of potential, but there's a chance he might not develop into a first team quality player. He very well might, but £10m now is a lot safer than gambling on his development.

true,coffpet,null,null,"Hmmm. Well, I'm a huge Bulls fan so I'll tell you about them first. They were amazing in the 90's (they had Michael Jordan, arguably the best player ever, won 6 titles). After he left the franchise had almost a decade of sub par play until they miraculously got their hometown hero Derrick Rose in the draft (Chicago is known for some terrible neighborhoods, lots of murder and whatnot, Rose grew up in that area and is a really modest and humble guy). He's been out two years now with injury. Between Rose and Joakim Noah, the team is built around defense, hard work, and a no nonsense style of play. They're one of the top teams who is somehow an underdog every year being in the East (the easier conference at the moment for whatever reason). 
Now, another team you might like is the Portland Trailblazers. They're known for terrible luck as they've had two of the biggest flops in draft histroy taken a pick before world class players (they could have had Michael Jordan way back when, and could have gotten Kevin Durant). It's almost looked at as a curse. They have only had one Championship, and they mean a lot to their city as they're the only major sports team in Portland and the city fucking loves them. They're two best players are Damian Lillard (one of the better Point Guards in the league, he was somewhat of a no name coming out of college and he's really young) and Lamarcus Aldrige who is really good and plays a really old style of game being a big man who can shoot. They're definitely an underdog, probably will finish 4th or so in the West, but they have a slight outside chance of making noise as a team. 
Some other teams to maybe research are The Clippers (one of the best teams in the league, but was TERRIBLE for a long time and were always little brother to the LA Lakers who they share an arena with). They're really good, but they've never won a championship so if they did that'd be pretty cool. The Oklahoma City Thunder are a cool team, a really small market in a pretty small city but they have some of the best players in the league in Durant and Westbrook. They're pretty new however, as the franchise used to be located in Seattle and only just moved to OKC and changed names about 5 years ago. 
The Golden State Warriors are a really fun team to watch. Really young, lots of good shooters, really hard working team that everyone would like to see succeed. Out of Oakland so a pretty small market, but not the smallest. Curry is like 25 years old and on pace to be the best shooter of all time statistically. They're a bit of a long shot for a title as well, but it could happen if things go right. 
Maybe you'll like the Washington Wizards, they're kinda fun and really young.

true,withabeard,,Pint of best - with a top if it's hot.,"&gt; this is one of the most ironic comments I've ever seen

I disagree, as I'm sure you already knew I would. There is a difference between enjoying beer, and preaching about it. Or even just being pretentious about it.

I've seen a lot come through recently that's really bugging me:

* People who believe that good beer can only come from America. 
* People who don't like their beer ""bitter"" but love Punk IPA.
* As mentioned above, apparently I'm not a real beer drinker because I don't adore the term craft beer.
* People who feel we need a new term to describe what every country in Europe has been doing for centuries.
* Marketing over quality. See brew dog for that one in the UK.
* Being fascinated by a handful of specific beers, and preaching them as the best thing ever.

I enjoy beer, and actually I enjoy drinking lots of what is coming out of the US. Lots of what is happening in the UK. But I'm not enjoying this wave of people who think the whole thing is new. Is something that needs to be pushed to the limits. That wants to categorise and label every beer with meaningless titles.

If you like your beer carbonated, or with ginger, or hopped to within an inch of its life. Then great, and fine. But it's not amazing, and it certainly isn't new. It's not something that needs ""protecting"".

And ironically, it's demolishing the very foundations of what it stands on. Small breweries in the UK are currently being battered by ""micro"" breweries such as brew dog hammering the whole scene with as much marketing and ""try hard"" as they can. It's fun and all, but I'll take a pint of whatever is on tap.

Weatherspoons, the showman of good beer. Proprietor of choice for CAMRA and the saviour of Englands poor indefencible micro-breweries. Fucking bollocks. Cheap ripp-off merchants screwing every penny they can out of the actually small breweries.

""Here sir. would you like some fine imported american craft beer""

No, I'll take a local brew and support someone who actually needs the money. Not some company big enough to fill hundreds of pubs thousands of miles away.

I'll accept I run with a certain pretentiousness over beer. You sure as shit wont see me drinking stella, I might stoop as low as Guinness if I'm pissed and there is nothing else on pump. But this ""craft beer"" thing that's appeared can fuck off.

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"&gt; At the end of a 'life' sentence, the people will be released regardless. After a life-sentence-length incarceration, those on a whole-life tariff can be reviewed and subsequently released or kept incarcerated dependent on the review. That's a key difference. 

I'm no expert, but I think you have that part a little wrong.

On a normal sentence, you will be sentenced to X amount of years. This means that, at X years, you are released.

On a life sentence, you will be sentenced to life, with Y years without parole. This means that you are guaranteed to be in prison for Y years, but after Y years, you can apply for parole. Where people and the media often trip up on this is assuming a 'life' sentence means you are imprisoned for your entire life, whereas it only means you *can* be imprisoned for life, but can still apply for parole after Y years. So, when people complain that 'life sentences no longer mean life', they are wrong, because they never did, at it has nothing to do with the government being softer on criminals, or the ECHR eroding victims rights.

You would likely get a mortgage on a BTL basis (interest only rather than capital and interest) and you would pick one that has no early repayment charges for clearing it otherwise bye bye profit. Also factor in estate agents costs for selling (1.5% plus vat would be normal). These mortgages usually need a 25% deposit minimum. You would want that plus cash savings to do up the property and avoid using a loan for home improvements. If not possible, you take the loan out after you get keys to the property. And ensure it too has no early repayment charges. 

The BTL is usually not dependent on personal income but expected rent recieved from property. 

Questions 1 and 2 depends, something like Croydon might not be a bad idea as it's commuting distance to London and getting a Westfields shopping centre. However prices gone up crazy fast there so hard to say if much profit to be made even if a fixer upper. Maybe something like Aldershot or Reading or Woking as commutable to London too but haven't risen as fast as inside M25 prices.

The bartender replies: ""Tell you what, mate. Don't go getting your knuckles bruised. See that big bloke over there? His name's Artie. Give him a quid and he'll do it for you.""

So the angry man goes over to Artie, gives him a quid, and explains the situation. Angry man says that this mate is currently at the supermarket over the road. Artie agrees to the proposition and heads over to the supermarket.

Artie walks around the car park for a bit until he sees this mate of angry man's. Artie grabs the man and starts throttling him. There's a security guard who sees this happening and runs over to help, but Artie lays into him too. Eventually the police arrive and manage to subdue Artie and take him into custody.

true,coffpet,null,null,"Franchise is sort of a synonym for team, and I guess for club. In America sometimes teams relocate or completely dismantle if they lose their fan base or run out of money. If the owner sells the team, the new owner might decide to move the team or the ""franchise"" and everything about them to a new city in a different arena. This happens a lot in American sports. 
""Small Market"" is I guess an American term. It's based around the idea that there are teams located in large cities where there's a big market for sports (Los Angeles, New York, Boston, Chicago). In America you'd call someone like the Houston Rockets a ""Mid Market"" because they're in a pretty big city, but not a huge one. Whereas a team like Oklahoma City Thunder are kinda weird cause they've got a lot of fans and therefore sell a lot of merchandise and whatnot, but they're in a really small city so they could be considered a small market team. A comparisson would be Manchester United is a big market team (like the LA Lakers), Spurs are the lower end of a big market (Like the Chicago Bulls), and a team like Golden State is probably similar to someone like Newcastle in market size. 
The ""draft"", something that exists in all American sports, is definitely a foreign concept to European sports. In America you can play sports for club teams, but you always play sports for your school. If you're good enough, you'll get a scholarship to a major university and play sports for a college and then after 1-4 years of school you can leave college and declare for the draft. Every team gets a slot based on their standings to pick their ""rights"" to a player who's eligible to be drafted. Then the draft happens, and after it the teams have to sign the players to a contract for an allotted amount of time and money.  America likes the idea that all teams have an equal chance to get better each year through the draft. It works in theory, but obviously like in soccer players can force transfers, pick big cities with big teams, as they have a lot of control since they're the ones with the skills.

Growing up I never really encountered these sorts of things (hey, I grew up in the Highlands, I was sheltered, sue me) - but when I went to uni and moved to a big city I also joined an organisation which has first aid training as a critical component of its training. Since then I've so far encountered two diabetics having seizures, one person passed out from heat exhaustion, and one drunk - all having hit the deck from their various conditions. In each case there have generally been people standing around but not once has anyone actually done anything, and in each case before beginning first aid I've had to tell someone (depending on the location) to either go get the medic or to call an ambo.

I truly don't understand it. It seems obvious to me that if someone has hit the deck they're broken and need medical attention, yet, your average person on the street seems just to either walk on by or to stare looking about as confused as a sheep running in front of a car.

So, to re-iterate what OP has said, if you don't know how to react to these things and you don't have first aid training, call 999 and tell them that someone is in distress and needs an ambo.

Yes, sometimes it turns out to be something silly - the time I got people to call an ambo for the drunk the paramedics knew him by name, but ultimately that's why we have the NHS and these guys are happy to turn up 9 times out of 10 to something not serious so long as the turn up to that 1/10 which is serious.

The teams with the best record have the fewest balls, the teams with the worst records have the most balls. There's a few more details to the system, but that's essentially how it works. And college and youth teams are definitely similar except the only difference is that there's no direct link from one to another.

To address the points you made, I was trying to avoid youth players because they aren't real depth IMO. More an emergency plan to cover significant injuries. They typically get put into the team very gradually and shouldn't be thrown in the deep end like Sterling was. 

For central defense we are adequately covered for numbers. Let's assume Lovren gets signed, (he plays on the right?). 

At LCB we have Sakho, Agger and Kolo can play there too. RCB we have Skrtel, Ilori, Kolo and Lovren. Plenty of bodies; 3 in each position minimum, and 5 in total. You can argue some aren't good enough, or Ilori needs another loan but as it stands we need to be replacing the players, rather than adding to them. You could maybe throw in Coates too but not sure I'd want to rely on him. 

If we get rid of Kolo, then we could be in trouble at LCB, especially considering Agger and Sakho's injury history. Unless Lovren can play there. I've heard mixed opinions. Apparently he is actually left footed but has never played on the left. (Can that be true?)

Unfortunately, most teams we come up against these days set up very deep and defend in numbers (especially at WHL), which limits the opportunities for someone like Griezmann to really open up into space.

Our greatest problem over the last two years has been an inability to consistently break down a packed, well organised defense.  That's where I think Valbuena is better - he's a much more crafty player with a more inventive passing ability.  But he also has pace, so he can play on the wing an break at speed too.

EDIT: And on Townsend, his end product for us has been wasteful, but his main opportunity in our first team was arguably when we were playing our worst in terms of attacking play.  For most games at the start of last season he looked like our only dangerous player.  That he failed to effectively link up with anyone else I think is as much a problem with his teammates as him.  The majority of the time he actually ran through a player or two, there was very little on other than a hopeful shot from range.

It is not a theory - it is common knowledge in coaching and playing circles. This is now ingrained in every level of the FA youth setup. What level of FA certificate do you hold? 

Technical skills provide the foundation for every other aspect of a player's development. Passing, ball control, heading, shooting, dribbling and more are skills that sets a player up. It is absurd to think players learn technical skills in his twenties. 

Why do you think Spanish, Brazilian and Argentinian players have superb technical skills? Did they learn that in their twenties, or was the foundation set up at a young age? 

Unlike Championship Manager, you can't select specific skill training for your first team players and see results coming within weeks. It doesn't work that way.

Edit: A couple of links you wanted - though all of this should have been covered in your coaching sessions.

The difference with BR is that he rates versatility very highly to the common x2 rule. He has played Downing as LB and Enrique as LM in his first season and then Sterling as a wide forward and then a center attacking mid this season (or even Lucas as our highest attacking mid).  

You could blame this on the depth in the past (which was true), but now it is apparent that BR looks for highly athletic, versatile team players that can occupy more than 1 given position, while still retaining the traditional squad players (reminds me of the ethos of Total Football, which I believe is partially reflected in BR's footballing philosophy). 

It is why Sahin (a very talented player) and Assaidi (a good mid-table player) didn't mesh well with BR. They wouldn't be flexible in how they played. 

Players that reflect BR's versatility policy: 

Johnson (RB/LB), 
Flanno (RB/LB), 
Allen (CDM/CM/CAM),
CP10 (CAM/LW/RW),
Sturridge (LW/RW/ST), 
Sterling (RW/LW/CAM),
Hendo (CDM/CM, or even that advanced midfield position he was always in outside the box, linking up with Surez), 
Lallana (CAM/LW/RW) and  
Markovic (LW/RW) 

Can can play LB and Sturridge can play as a wide forward but I agree that we need an additional LB (which we are linked with every day). I have a feeling that Ibe will go out on loan. His situation is similar to Sterling 2 years ago, but unlike then, we can afford to ship him out for experience (but I wouldn't mind him staying either-- CL will be great experience for him). Definitely still think Borini will be leaving us, so that leaves us with Sturridge, Remy and Lambert as ST depth, which isn't bad. 

I personally love all the recruitments that BR is making because of the versatility and creativity this team will undoubtedly display. But I agree, we still need depth in certain areas (CB, LB and maybe a ST), but the common ""x2"" in every position is different with BR in my opinion.

true,coffpet,null,null,"I'll give you the absolute basics. The rest will be pretty easy to pick up from watching. 
Scoring: Shots within the three point arc (the big half circle) are worth 2 points. Shots outside are worth 3 points. If you're fouled while you're shooting you get to shoot ""free throws"" (each shot worth just one point). The number of free throws depends on the shot you take (if it's a 2 pointer or 3 pointer) and if you made your original shot or not. If you missed it, you get to take the same number of shots as your original shot was worth, so either 2 or 3. If you made your original shot you get to take one free throw no matter what. 
Positions: There's 5 players on the court at the same time. Traditionally, you play with a Point Guard, Shooting Guard, Small Forward, Power Forward, and Center (they generally get bigger in size from Point Guard to Center). These roles can change a little bit and sometimes teams will sub in different players and will have two of one position based on strategy. There's unlimited subs so teams use this to their advantage. 
Fouls: In the NBA each player is allowed 4 fouls, after their 5 they are ejected from the game. 
Games: Each game is made up of four periods called ""quarters"". There's no ties. If it's tied there's an Overtime period and these exist until there's a winner.
Season format: there's an 82 game season. Each team belongs to a ""conference"". The top 8 teams from each conference go to the playoffs. In the playoffs each conference has a bracket to decide who plays the best team from the opposite conference in the NBA Finals. In the playoffs teams play each other in a ""best of seven"" series, meaning that they'll play their opposing team in up to 7 games (the first team to win 4 games takes the series and moves on in the bracket). These games aren't played on the same day by the way, there's like a day or two between each game.

I've heard of that before. Many people talk about the need for two players per position, but to me that always seemed slightly inadequate.

To me, I've always felt like three players per position was closer to what a Champions League team would need. But obviously you can't go around buying 3 players per position. Not only would 33 players cost too much but playing time for the out of favour players would be atrocious. 

On the other hand you can't rely solely on versatility. Looking at the extreme example of having 11 players, all capable of playing any of 11 positions would be false depth in each position. 

So there has to be a balance between these two extremes, and to quantify that balance isn't easy, but I think I've managed to come close to achieving that balance in my post.

I agree with your comments about Rodgers too. He definitely relies on versatility, and that's a great observation regarding Assaidi and Sahin.

The Court of Appeal (of England and Wales) can't overturn rulings by the European Court of Human Rights.  You have to bear in mind that the Court of Appeal and the ECtHR have very different jobs.  The ECtHR is there to interpret the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and decide whether it has been violated - it doesn't have any direct ability to ensure its rulings are enforced.  The Court of Appeal is there to interpret English law, and its rulings are binding unless they are successfully appealed.  Much of the ECHR forms part of English law (and Scots law, and Northern Irish law) as a result of the Human Rights Act, and domestic courts are supposed to take into account ECtHR rulings when interpreting it, but they aren't necessarily required to follow ECtHR rulings exactly, and the ECHR doesn't necessarily trump other laws.  Ultimately, the onus is on the UK government to ensure that ECtHR rulings are followed - in some cases, this happens automatically through the courts, but in other cases it requires new legislation.

Also, the actual dispute in this case between the UK government and the ECtHR was much narrower than a lot of people seem to think.  The ECtHR says that all prisoners serving a whole-life sentence have to have at least a theoretical possibility of having their sentences reduced.  Prior to 2003, these sentences could be reviewed by ministers after 25 years.  Since then, ministers still have a power that allows them to release prisoners serving whole-life tariffs, but the [ECtHR judgment](http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/fra/pages/search.aspx?i=001-122664#{%22itemid%22:[%22001-122664%22]}) says that it is not clear whether this power can be used in all cases, so it isn't quite good enough.  The Court of Appeal later disagreed with this assessment and allowed some whole-life sentences to go ahead under the current rules.  I don't know if the case is being appealed to the Supreme Court - if not, the government will presumably have to step in if it wants to uphold its treaty obligations.",0,1406077054,null,0,false,0,cj50v08,t3_2bfhm0,t1_cj50v08,t1_cj4tzup,null,1434850632,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,Hetys,null,null,"I think the idea that people should pay for an education in a subject which does not qualify them for a job has dangerous implications. It's not just the general, non-specific skills that such degrees provide that are good for society, but the content of the degrees themselves.

I think everyone in society benefits when people's social networks contain people who are educated in a whole variety of subjects to an undergraduate level: this situation allows people to more easily acquire information and follow-up reading on many subjects they might be interested in beyond the superficial analysis of internet blogs and Wikipedia articles. One might argue that researching a topic is as simple as picking up a book, but I would disagree from my own experience: this sort of independent research was required for my AS level Extended Project, and I quickly found I had no idea what sort of academic resources were available on my subject, how broad or precise an investigation should be in order that the research is actually manageable, etc.

If you were to insist that people pay for an education in a field that employers don't require, then I think this would have a dreadful impact on the working class: you'd effectively be saying that only the wealthy classes should have a thorough understanding of philosophy, and history, and politics, and psychology. It would be a perverse society wherein, say, only the wealthy could seriously study the history and politics of working class struggle, for example. Removing nodes of such information from working class social networks would eliminate one of the significant opportunities by which they can access the specific knowledge that one needs in order to be a democratic citizen in any meaningful and conscientious way. 

I'm fairly convinced by Robert Hutchins' ideas about the structure of education up to undergraduate level that he lays out in his University of Utopia, where all students are trained in the same prescribed liberal arts tradition, in order that everyone has the same extensive base of knowledge that is essential to meaningful democratic citizenship, and forms a base for active lifelong learning, and the state does not train a business' employees for them. Even with the highly specialized degrees that we have in the UK, though, I still think that it's beneficial to society simply to have people educated in a whole variety of subjects out there, able to share their knowledge with the rest of society.",0,1406081123,null,0,false,0,cj52rrz,t3_2bdxrb,t1_cj52rrz,t1_cj4snby,null,1434851501,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I would actually recommend that you start with college basketball (because they care more in the regular season than NBA teams) and then watch March Madness, which is always great, and then watch the NBA playoffs.

Right now we simply have the best assembly of English talent. We've got people in attack, in midfield, and in defense. Having a British core is only a benefit if the players are good. Look no further than our signings a few summers back to know that signing British for the sake of it doesn't always work out.

Adam Lallana is the best attacking English player that would have been available this window. Lambert is the best back up/second option striker we could have signed. Both are exceptionally solid individuals.

All the other players we're signing (or about to sign) have come from abroad or aren't English. Having PL proven players is invaluable when your side cannot afford to fuck up like City and Chelsea can in the transfer market. 

We can't make mistakes and just throw cash at another big dick signing the next summer. So signing PL proven players takes a huge transition out of the equation. The transition to the PL game. Signing English players takes a cultural transition out of the equation. Signing players who all play together on a single international side takes a lot of the ""gelling"" issue out of the equation.


You're clearly new because no one thinks English players ""are the best"". That doesn't mean certain English players aren't the best for us right now. Brendan has identified a few and brought them into the fold.

It helps for clubs to have a unifying international factor. You see this at all clubs. They don't just sign one German, they sign three. It makes the transition easier for everyone.

Madrid is a great example of a club that has basically bought the international flavor of the month for every few summer windows. A while back it was Dutch players (Robben, Sneidjer, Huntellafhdkad...) and then it was Germans (there two CBs were German, Ozil, Kheidira, etc).

Arsenal have some Germans. Newcastle's best season coincided with an influx of French talent. United had a Portuguese pipeline for a while.


I'm very happy with our summer so far. Transfers are never sure bets but when you remove a lot of the transition facets out of the equation you're getting closer to something that should work out.

LOL. Come on. Don't be naive.

Do you think those communities give two shits about empowering women? 

&gt;Make sure children in these communities are in our school system. Make sure pregnant women from these communities are told of the dangers to their daughters' health that arise from something they may see as being merely a benign adherence to their culture.

That's fair enough. But honestly, I think many of them don't care about the health risks. Culture/tradition/religion often outweighs common sense.

&gt;only increases the 'Us vs Them' mentality and prevents any form of discussion taking place. 

I'm really fine with that. I don't want to discuss anything with them, other than to repeatedly say ""stop doing that, you cunts""

&gt;what do you think would be more effective in changing the viewpoint of an adolescent boy who has been raised in an über-male-chauvinist culture? Telling him he's wrong and that if he doesn't change that he'll be thrown in prison?

Yes. Some things just simply ARE wrong. I don't believe those people are open to reason, or willing to listen. But the threat of harsh punishments might deter people. 

&gt;Or telling him that women who have their clitorises and labias intact not only have a more aesthetically pleasing body, but are far more likely to enjoy sexual intercourse?

This is really naive. Of course those people know that already. That is precisely WHY they carry out FGM in the first place - because they don't WANT the girl to have any sexual pleasure. These people aren't actually stupid. They are just disgusting and place too much value on tradition/religion.

They already know it is dangerous. They already know it is wrong too. That's why it is done in secret by unlicensed old women in the UK who they contact through their community, or they send the girls abroad to have it done. 

The ONLY solution is massive punishments for anybody and everybody associated with this. We need to send a very clear message that this will not be tolerated in the UK in any way.

true,Melberger,1972crest,,"It isn't as simple as that, but that's what it boiled down to.

Our interest was long standing and firm, Isco was keen on joining Pellegrini and had apparently given him assurances he'd sign.

Real's interest only materialised after his performances at the U21 tournament.

Isco was still unsure because he'd given us his word, and was unsure about the amount of playing time he'd receive. But at the same time there were rumours he wanted a contract bigger than what City were offering, and City had (and still do) have a policy of not being taken for a ride by agents.

So, along came Real with Zidane travelling to Israel and the U21 tournament to commence Real's underhand tactics.

He promised him that he'd be given regular playing time, and that he was a big part of their plans. That was a turning point in which Real became an attraction option for him whereas previously he was sceptical.

But he'd given City his word, and old quotes of his surfaced of him saying he disliked Real and was an Antimadridista. That's when things were 50/50. City were adamant he'd sign however, and didn't make any further offers to Isco or his agent.

Real then offered the apparent €8m sum to his father, Isco's agent, in a panic to push through the transfer.

The underhand tactics were complete and Isco went back on his word to City and joined Real against all logic.

I suppose you could say that he was somewhat of a victim because he allowed himself to be fooled by the courtship of Zidane about playing time, and the pressure of effective bribery of his father would've been hugely significant, but make no mistake, he led us down the garden path. We were the right move at the right time and he chose against it.

I still remember how even the players were expecting him to arrive and were excited about the prospect, certainly Pellegrini was shocked when he went to Real.

What I REALLY loved about the classic series is that it sort of drove home for me what I think is the show's biggest strength. This counts for the new series too. Each Doctor's run is almost like a whole new show. A new adventure. And they're all amazing. I love every Doctor/Era, but im one of those guys that doesn't vocally dislike a ton of stuff. I just think its amazing that this show has lasted as long as it has after reinventing itself so many times. 

I loved watching the classics from start to finish and reccomend it to anyone who thinks they might want to do it. I think its important to be patient and watch everything without skipping ahead, but I'm a bit of a completionist. If you're more interested in just sampling each Doctor, this sub or the r/gallifrey one are great places to ask for suggestions.


Overall, the old series is definitely on par with the new (assuming the obvious difference in production quality and style of a show from the 60s isnt going to put you off). There are tendencies of the new series that I prefer as well as ones where I prefer the way classic who handled itself.

Overspend on 1-2 ridiculous strikers who are almost guaranteed to get lots of goals, grab a couple of great midfielders and then pack the defence and rest of midfield with players who play for a low-mid table team who will play every single week.

true,beyondReturn,null,null,"Liverpool is in England, the management wants to bring through youth players who again are mostly English, having a first team full of foreigners and then wanting to promote young English players is very odd and doesn't work out well (Look at City and Chelsea for example, although their problems run deeper). 
  
When you want to establish team chemistry, nationality and language (culture mostly, i.e they hang around in their free time) allows this to great extent, which is why you see clubs who buy multiple players from the same market. Arsenal had huge French group and now turned into Germany, not because Arsene lost his knowledge of French league, but because one player pulls another and so on. Liverpool had Spanish players which still continues to this day. Players like environment they can settle inn easy without having problems adapting in their personal life and their professional life.
  
Which brings us back to point 1. If we have plan of making a team consisting of youth players we develop most of them will be English. If that is the case they should be integrating into a team that shares both their nationality and language/culture. In our club the SA/Spanish/Portuguese hang out, the English (huge group divided by age + priorities (family/kids)) hang out etc.  If tomorrow someone is promoted from the academy they will still hang out with academy players but they will also start hanging out with the other senior players they share nationality and language with.
  
If BR goes to a German team he would do the same and put ""too much trust in German players"" same with Spanish or French as long as he is in their league.

Arsene Wenger wasted a decade of his career trying to pull this off (both youth products and chemistry) as he had already seen what chemistry does from his French imports. Look at RM with Portuguese and Spanish players, Ozil left and they got Kroos, there are multiple players who have played in PL. From France they have Benzema and Varane. Only one who seems to be from country or culture of his own is Bale and there are 4 players who have played in the league he just moved from for multiple years.
  
I'm glad we got Lovren, he should get along with Sakho and Markovic (see how much Lucas did for Coutinho when he first arrived and the social circle he is part of now). For Sakho he will help greatly with in-game chemistry (Coutinho/Sturridge, Sterling/Suarez etc.) and for Markovic hopefully given he has played in PL a season he will help him settle.

This is all some general behavior it's not always the case, such as Sahin connecting with younger and Spanish Suso (doubt Sahin knew Spanish that well after a year) and Borini.",0,1406085758,null,0,false,0,cj54xxf,t3_2bgf5z,t1_cj54xxf,t3_2bgf5z,null,1434852592,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

It's as much about attitude and team identity/style as it is about whether the team is successful, and teams seem to be fairly fluid in terms of success in the NBA; my team, the Celtics, are one of the winningest in league history (well over a dozen titles to their name), and were in the finals just three or four years ago, but are currently going through a serious rebuilding period and haven't even made the playoffs recently.

The Spurs are definitely going to challenge again this year, but it's no guarantee.  If you start watching though, I think you'll find they're a really respectable team that plays attractive, attacking basketball.  Keep an eye on Tim Duncan, who's a veteran all-star known for serious technical brilliance and all-around fantastic accuracy and leadership.  He's their star, but compared to, say, Lebron James, he's way more low-key.  When James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh were all at the Miami Heat for the past few seasons, the Heat saw a SERIOUS upswing in bandwagon fans who I suspect are all going to jump ship now that James is off to Cleveland.  The Heat were definitely a team for glory-hunting fans.  The Spurs, not so much.

That said... support the Celtics.  Rajon Rondo is a beast of a point guard.  Other options might be the Phoenix Suns (where Tottenham supporter Steve Nash, shown above, spent most of his career) and the aforementioned Washington Wizards (just signed Paul Pierce, a former Celtic and future Hall-of-Famer with serious skill).",0,1406090532,null,0,false,0,cj570b8,t3_2bf2l5,t1_cj570b8,t1_cj4z2dl,null,1434853537,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

&gt;

&gt;__Mateja Kežman__ ([Serbian Cyrillic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_Cyrillic_alphabet): Матеја Кежман; born 12 April 1979) is a retired [Serbian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia) professional [footballer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) who played as a [striker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(association_football\)#Striker).

&gt;Upon playing in his homeland, Kežman went on to play top-flight football in the Netherlands, England, Spain, Turkey, France, Russia, Hong Kong and Belarus. Arguably, he is most known for his career at [PSV Eindhoven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven), where he amassed numerous awards and world wide recognition as having the potential to be one of the greatest strikers of his generation; he was named [Dutch Footballer of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Footballer_of_the_Year) in 2003, and a year later he became the [UEFA Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Cup) joint top scorer. He was subsequently labeled as a flop after his spell at [Chelsea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.), as there were extremely high expectations of him.  By the end of his illustrious career, he had amassed a record amount of championship medals in the top-tier competitions of five different countries.  On the international scene, Kežman represented [FR Yugoslavia / Serbia and Montenegro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia_and_Montenegro_national_football_team) at the [UEFA Euro 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2000) and [2006 FIFA World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_FIFA_World_Cup).

&gt;After finishing his professional playing career, Kežman became a [sports agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_agent).  He also served as a [director of football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_football) at [Vojvodina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FK_Vojvodina) in 2013.

Nasty got a lot of plaudits when he first joined City because he was so young and he was a bazillion times better looking than Stefan Savic, the player he replaced.   

However time has proven a few things;  most damaging is that he is not the quickest, both of natural pace or of footballing brain.   He makes mistakes under pressure and is often caught out of position.  

He is quiet on the pitch, even timid, despite having the frame to handle more.  Is this youth?  Potentially.  

I am afraid that hype still rules peoples perceptions of Nastasic.   In the long run he looks to be pretty average.   

In a time where Pellegrini has really brought out the best in many players, Nastasic regressed (and maybe injuries played their part.)

It may be blasphemous to say it, but after the season he just had in Italy, Savic may be the better player.   ",0,1406094154,null,0,false,0,cj58cd5,t3_2bdu3s,t1_cj58cd5,t3_2bdu3s,null,1434854154,1,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,1

I would say our best chant is the one we nicked from German St Pauli, that every PL seemed to nick from us, We Love You (after we score or after the game).

Other good ones are ""Pride of South London"" ""Here's To You"" and ""When I Was a Young Boy""

Generally in top level football in England the home sides fans don't really sing or create an atmosphere. Its a strange phenomenon because you would expect outnumbering the away fans significantly would make you louder by default. Palace are also regarded as specifically having the best atmosphere. The only time I remember the fans not being louder than the away fans when we lost to Newcastle (they have good fans) when it was 3-0 and when we losing to Fulham at 3-1 which we eventually lost 4-1 and there was a lot of frustration that essentially got the manager sacked / resigned. 


Palace were involved in the best game of the PL last season. Liverpool were in 2nd battling for the title, Palace were safe and couldn't go down or threat a Europe place. Arguably we had nothing to play for with 2 games to go. Liverpool were 3-0 with 12 mins to go. Our fans as ever didnt give up and we all witnessed our greatest comeback when we got back to 3-3, which ruined Liverpool's chances of the title and made Luis Suarez cry on the pitch.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"Rather than talking about how many games he should be playing this season, lets talk about what he's bringing to the table that Rodgers and Liverpool will need to replace:

- **Excellent passing range and creativity, enabling us to transition rapidly from attack to defence**

- Physicality and good defensive technique

- Set piece delivery

- Intangibles (leadership, experience, vocal organisation)

Physicality and good defensive technique - Probably the most easy to replace, but rule out Joe Allen as a long-term candidate for the role. His best position is the one he'll be combating Henderson for.

Set pieces - we're not going to buy someone just for their set pieces (sigh, Charlie Adam), and guys like Coutinho and Lallana will have to step up. 

Intangibles - Again, most likely that other players will have to step up here. Henderson and Lallana are candidates, while if Lovren offers the defensive command he's supposed to, that reduces the burden there.

So the first one is probably the most difficult to replace, and quite frankly I doubt whoever takes over as DM from Gerrard will play in the Pirlo-Alonso-Gerrard mould. They'll instead be more of a standard DM. Can is a contender, we know Lucas can play the role, and depending on his development Rossiter might come into the picture. 

But if we're not getting that creativity from the DM, that means we'll need more from the CM's - especially Henderson and Allen, whose relatively low creative output has thus far been OK due to Gerrard and Coutinho.

But if you are already requiring them to watch a few episodes, it's a bit irrelevant as a starting point and the scary villains of the show may discourage a mother and children from watching the show, actually.

All of Series 1 is incredibly interesting and covers its explanations and episode themes/types pretty well by the end, but the effects are a little dated and can be a no-go.

The Eleventh Hour is good, but the theme of it is unlike everything else in the show. It was actually a bit racey especially with the ""Kiss-O-Gram"" outfit. They were clearly targeting teenage audiences, but as a high school student I think it was in poor taste. 

Maybe if you do the first two one right after the other, the Eleventh Hour and the one on the Starship U.K and the space whale?

I would hate to start with Smith's Doctor, because Tennant's Doctor is so much better and I think that regeneration holds more power when you see the good man die and a stranger with big hair and a bigger chin take his place, but do whatever you want there.

But then encourage them to go back and watch the older episodes before Smith, my personal favorite era. Tennant is of course the best Doctor but Eccleston introduces the series quite well, and his episodes are either fantastic stories worth experiencing OR essential to the plot save the finale.

Oh dear. You sound like a retarded Mr T. Are you sure you are on the right forum? 'Crass American Idiots Talking Shite' is over there---&gt;

Anyway, the fantastic success of Atletico is what is known as an outlier. An unsustainable aberration. They have little money, and sell their best player to a big club every season. Their La Liga success was indeed admirable and I was delighted they won. 

But they won't win it this year. Guaranteed. That amazing alchemy when a driven talented manager cobbles together a team of young unknowns, castoffs and aging players will not work for more than one or two years.

There is always an AM, or even a Dortmund having unlikely and unsustained success. And then the usual order is restored. The biggest, richest clubs plunder their players and win. Bayern, Barca, Real. And in France, the influx of Arab cash has meant that Lyon and Marseilles and previous Champions have no chance of beating Arab owned Monaco or PSG.

Because money is what wins trophies consistently. We had our big 'outlier' chance last season. We all know it. We blew it. And we won't be winning it this year either.

Even in the new series, there are transition companions. Rose started out as a full time companion, but also took over the dual role of transition when she introduced us to 10. She left the show shortly afterwards.

Clara appears to have been set up in the same way as previous transition companions, only brought in in Matt's last series to ease the transition to a new Doctor after losing Amy and Rory. 

Going by previous history of the show, I'll be highly surprised if she makes it to series 9. I give her until Christmas, to be honest; unless she turns out like Tegan, which I doubt.

&gt;
&gt; When an adult man was prosecuted for “buggery” after having consensual sex with a 16-year-old during the period when the age of consent for homosexual intercourse was 18 years of age, the ECHR ruled that his right to a private life (article 8) had been violated.

So we're encouraging lawbreaking and adults having homosexual sex with young boys. Yay human rights!

true,ltadman,null,null,"Well it depends what sorts of things you like doing but here are a few ideas:

 There's a board game cafe called Thirsty Meeples in the centre (by the coach station I think) which is supposed to be pretty fun. 

If you wanna play pool, one of the last pool tables in central Ox is at The Wheatsheaf, a heavy metal/rock pub. Some of the patrons look a lil scary but they're all super friendly. 

One of my best dates was to buy a burrito from Mission Burrito (there's 2 in town) and then walk around either Christ Church college ground or University Parks (I've done both) the amount of beautiful parks right in the centre is awesome.
 
In terms of fun and interesting places to drink; the Cowley Road is your best bet. Big Society is kinda expensive but has cool cocktails and a foosball table and a ping pong table. There's also a couple other very coolly decorated bars along that road.
You also have to hit up Hi Lo, it's a very grungy Jamaican bar (we're still on Cowley Road) but it stays open really late and when it's busy it has a great atmosphere.

You should also get ice cream at one of the G&amp;D's, they're sprinkled around the city and their super chocolate flavour is the best chocolate ice cream I've had in the UK/US. 

Oxford is also great just for going on an explore, particularly at night as the city is so safe. If you walk under the bridge of sighs copy (the left of the Sheldonian if you're facing it) then there's a very pretty alleyway you can wander down and end up nearer to the Cowley side of town. You should also go to the Turf Tavern which is down a little alleyway right under the bridge of sighs.

Also, do the touristy stuff like climbing the University Church of St Mary the Virgin - personally I think it's worth it.

To have a full 25 man CL squad we need 8 homegrown players, of which 4 must be club trained. At the moment we have three club trained players in the squad (JT, McEachran and Aké), and 5 association trained players (Cahill, Lukaku, Fabregas, Bertrand, and Moses).  

Considering that 3 of those are likely to be sold we need U21 players to take their places. Christensen is the most likely candidate in my opinion. 

Chalobah won't count as club trained but will be association trained.

true,damphoussed,,,"I'm an American supporter as well and the decision I made to support Celtic was a fairly arbitrary one. When I was thirteen, I got my hands on a catalog of soccer merchandise that my cousin had. Each major European club team had a section of a page and the one I was instantly drawn to was the Celtic section. I fell in love with Celtic after doing some research on the club's history and the support culture, but the initial thing that drew me to the club was literally the aesthetics of the ad I saw in that catalog 8 years ago. I did try following some EPL teams on for size, but I just didn't feel as attached to them as I did Celtic.

The point I'm trying to make is that you should just go with your gut feeling and support who you want to support. If you were to ask most sports fans to rationalize their love of their favorite clubs/teams outside of geographic proximity or family influence or arbitrary reasons like my own they probably couldn't. 

The only kind of shitty thing about being a Celtic fan at the moment is that there's no real competition in the Scottish Premiership for Celtic to face. Imagine if your favorite MLB team was forced to play in AAA or your favorite NFL team forced to play in the NCAA. That's what it's like for Celtic right now.

My advice to you is to see if there's a [Celtic supporters club](http://www.nafcsc.com/) near you where you can watch matches and meet other Celtic supporters.

The way Real operate is a joke, I agree. But we were punished because we fell foul, marginally, of the [bullshit] FFP rules on acceptable losses over a certain period.

Real and United can spend so much because their overall revenue is much greater than ours, they're still meeting the FFP criteria.

But in a year or two we'll have increased our revenue and the playing field will be less uneven in that respect.

Just goes to show though how FFP undermines competition and serves even further to create a monopoly among the top clubs with the greatest revenue.

Don't agree on Isco. I think he's a marginally superior player to Nasri at present, with the potential to develop even further. Pace isn't a huge issue, he's a similar athlete to Nasri, and neither have an abundance of pace.

I agree though about our abundance of forwards and Jovetic needing playing time. That's why we'd need to sell one of them, IMO, if we were serious about signing Isco.

If he did arrive we'd likely cease playing 2 up front, so 4 top strikers would be excessive. Either that, or we'd have to sell a midfielder to accommodate him.

Hypothetical, but if he had signed last summer I think he'd be regarded as one of the best midfielders in the league right now, and Nasri probably wouldn't have got a new contract and moved to another club.

But he didn't sign, and Nasri's raised his game and earned a new contract, so it's more complicated now.

That's nice. Oh, we're casting the net wider instead of addressing the priorities of first-world, game-playing children? What's the point of that, exactly? Does it make a difference to the priorities of the children I was talking about?

&gt;Head down to the most impoverished countries in the world, approach a child holding a loaf of bread in one have and a video game in the other, see which hand is empty first.

Now head over to the first-world areas where the games companies have made their money in the past thirty years to become bigger than the movie and music industry combined purely based on the price of the games, because that's what is being discussed, and has been since the beginning (this thread is about game playing *in Britain*, remember?).

I could take you to the north pole and insist that because kids there eat fish and don't have mobiles, the rest of the world doesn't need meat or phones. But that would be silly, because I'd be using an extreme example rather than providing a genuine response.

&gt;It's obvious to me that you're conditioned to think that the entire world is living to a first world standard

It's more obvious that you've reached the disingenuous stage, if you've expanded your examples to the impoverished when that's obviously far outside the group being discussed.

&gt;For you to say that food and water is not a concern for a child is grossly narrow minded.

Good job that wasn't what I was saying, isn't it?

true,pking8786,null,null,"If I could play devil's advocate and just say that I am for internet pirating, but I don't pirate games anymore (did as a kid). Now that the facility exists to buy games cheaply online (via steam) then I don't feel the need to. 

The issue is more complex, as the video game industry is heavily reliant on quality trust. If you bought a game back in the day, you expect that game to be fun, enjoyable and worth the money, but what if it isn't? You can't return a game because it isn't fun. You're out of pocket, and the game developer reputation takes a hit, vis a vis, you don't buy their games again. 

Since the advent of large gaming companies, such as EA, 2k, Bioware, etc. The portfolio of games are so wide ranging that it's impossible to tell if the game is good before you play it. Misleading game trailers ^^Not ^^actual ^^gameplay ^^footage , and buying good reviews, social media manipulation, misleading demos and shady marketing means that there's no way to know if a game is good, or just has clever gimmicks. I, for one, don't like the idea of paying to take a gamble with my £50. 

So if a game had mixed reviews, I'd pirate it, play it and if I liked it, I'd buy it. At the moment, for whatever reason, I have 5 copies of Fallout 3, 3 copies of FNV, 4 copies of XCOM, 3 copies of skyrim and 4 copies of oblivion. (between xbox versions, pc versions, game of the year editions, collectors editions). HOWEVER, that wouldn't be the case if I hadn't pirated morrowind back when I was a kid. 

When it came down for it for me, it wasn't that I couldn't afford it, it was that I don't want to support developers that make bad games and try to mislead me, so if the game is good, then I'd support them. 

That said, if the facility exists to get something for free, then of course people will use it. A lot of the time it's quicker and easier to pirate a game than deal with the bullshit that comes with buying a game these days, Uplay, origin, season passes and online passes are bullshit. 

But if you don't like something for nothing, then don't listen to the radio, and buy your music randomly. Also, if you don't have sky or cable, only watch BBC, and pay your TV license. And if somebody offers you a sample of something in CostCo, run away, they are the devil.

I have had a word with a co-worker of mine and you can infact catch Taxi at the rank at Malton station. It might be worth still booking in advanced though, then you can ask for an idea on how much it will cost.

On top of the Abby and walking around the town, here's a few more details on the things I mentioned:

 * The Magpie Cafe (I forgot to mention this, if you're gonna eat anywhere, eat here. Whether it's fish and chips or any of the food it is fantastic and the probably the most famous restaurant in North Yorkshire. Keep in mind there are often queues to get in though) - [Website](http://www.magpiecafe.co.uk/) - [Google Maps](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Magpie/@54.489101,-0.614962,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x487f176fb6b27909:0x2fc97357f980f603)

Where are you from? If you're not used to the UK keep in mind that if you're going on the beach we have some of the biggest tide changes in the world. You might have seen [this reddit post showing them](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1yw7w9/low_tide_and_high_tide_in_great_britain/) (it's been reposted a few times too). So check the [tide times](http://www.tidetimes.org.uk/) if you're going to walk along the beach!

The North Sea is rather cold. Doesn't stop us a few hardy locals and British holiday makers from swimming in it though! Myself included. There is even a surf school at the other end of Whitby beach at Sandsend (a small coastal village). August/September is when the North Sea is at it's warmest as it's been warmed up all summer. It might not be your thing, but I make a point to paddle in the sea whenever I'm near it. :-)

true,DukePPUk,null,null,"On the whole life tariffs (which was reported badly - as usual), it is worth remembering that the [ECtHR ruling](http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/2013/645.html) was very narrow - as was the Court of Appeal's response.

The ECtHR's position was that indefinite prison sentences with no possibility of review are wrong (Judge Power-Forde's concurring opinion sets out a neat argument for why they should be). The UK Government pointed out that there was a mechanism for review (by ministers). The ECtHR found that there was confusion about it; there had been a Court of Appeal case that had listed the circumstances when this power would be used, but there was a subsequent ""Prisons Order"" (secondary legislation) the Government had issued that set out much narrower grounds. The ECtHR found that this meant the law was unclear and couldn't be relied upon - thus there was no appropriate mechanism for review.

The news reported that the Court of Appeal overturned this and disagreed with the ECtRH - which is technically true, but they disagreed on only a narrow point. In their [ruling](http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2014/188.html) (in a different set of cases), the CoA found that the law wasn't unclear; the Government was wrong. It didn't matter how many Prisons Orders or secondary legislation the Government passed saying how it would exercise this power, they'd have to exercise it according to the Court of Appeal's rules.

So the Government won the case by successfully arguing that it was talking nonsense and could be ignored. But that wasn't reported in the press...

On whole life tariffs replacing capital punishment, that's not quite right. The mandatory life sentence for murder replaced capital punishment (over the objections of the Law Commission, iirc, who wanted a maximum life sentence). Whole life tariffs are a consequence of having a mandatory sentence; judges can't lower the sentence, so instead rely on tariffs for dealing with the severity of the crimes.

The whole life tariff used to be imposed by the Government, but that had to be changed to the courts as the Government was bad at not imposing them for political reasons.",0,1406107115,null,0,false,0,cj5bn6f,t3_2bfhm0,t1_cj5bn6f,t1_cj4tzup,null,1434855820,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

&gt; All of which are important to an adult, not a child.

This is exactly what you said. 

&gt;Oh, we're casting the net wider instead of addressing the priorities of first-world, game-playing children? What's the point of that, exactly? Does it make a difference to the priorities of the children I was talking about?

We absolutely are. Just because a child lives in a first world country doesn't mean they are well off, look at the statistics for the poverty line in the UK and US, and you'll see that a shocking percentage of children have parents who can't afford to feed them. 

Not to mention the social pressures that exist, due to the juxtaposition of middle class and poverty stricken children in the educational system. Not to mention the ostracism that poorer children can face through being excluded from the schoolyard zeitgeist. 

&gt;Now head over to the first-world areas where the games companies have made their money in the past thirty years to become bigger than the movie and music industry combined purely based on the price of the games, because that's what is being discussed, and has been since the beginning (this thread is about game playing in Britain, remember?).

Erm, I'd like to see some statistics on that, as last time I checked, the largest budget for a video game was $265 mil (GTA V), the largest budget movie is still $300 mil (Pirates of the Carribbean). Also, Avatar grossed $2.8 billion, whereas COD black ops grossed $1.5 billion. 

&gt;It's more obvious that you've reached the disingenuous stage, if you've expanded your examples to the impoverished when that's obviously far outside the group being discussed.

If you don't believe that there are impoverished people in the UK, then you've got your head buried in the sand. 

&gt;do you want to give examples of first-world children that have the same priorities as an adult? 

Yeah, okay, how about children IN THE UK who are being married off to relatives in Pakistan, or children of drug addicts and alcoholics who don't get fed outside of free school meals? What about victims of abuse who grow up really fucking quick. 

Of course I know of some children who have different priorities, but I also know of children who don't. You're the one making blanket statements about what children want, and what I'm saying is that people's priorities are different. You can't just make accurate blanket statements about what is right and what is wrong. It's just arrogant

A diploma of higher education, or just DipHE can be awarded if you successfully pass 240 credits of study over two years. If you have over 120 credits over one year it's worth a certificate of higher education, or CertHE. (edit: these are for honours degrees, i don't deal with ordinary degrees much but i think the numbers are 200/100 respectively) 

The uni i work at will happily award you one of these awards if you don't complete the course for whatever reason, but every uni is different and i can easily see other institutions not wanting to advertise that you can still get some sort of award if you don't finish. Remember, once you get any type of award it precludes any opportunity to complete later on. 

Make no mistake though, many consider these awards the booby prize compared to a degree. In today's world of everyone getting pushed through university you can imagine how much clout it will carry against even a third class Bachelors Degree. Still, for a lot of jobs it may be enough, and at the very least should make it easier to get on another course in the future.

If we are comparing the two via possession stats there is no comparison. The stats don't lie. Arsenal are always near the top for possession % in the Prem. There are many other teams around Europe that dominate possession better and thus by your reckoning induce comparison to Barca.

The same goes for short passing and slow buildup. As to fluidity in role I don't see that from Arsenal. It's not as if they play 'Total Football'. 

Don't embarrass yourself. Flamini or Arteta collect the ball from the CB's and distribute it to attacking players thereby being an obvious pivot.

Released on November 9, 2010, the game quickly smashed sales records, racking up more than 7 million worldwide sales in its first 24 hours. Current sales of the game are estimated at between 18 and 20 million copies - not bad for a game that's been on shelves for less than 2 months.
Call of Duty: Black Ops isn't just successful in terms of sales, however. According to torrent-centric blog TorrentFreak, it's also 2010's most pirated PC game.  TorrentFreak estimates that over 4.2 million copies of the game have been downloaded.

People play the pirated game and enjoy it = then go out and buy it.

E: 

&gt; People who have a culture of relying on ethnicity rather than the quality of application letters for university applications would be less successful because quality of application letters is what admits a person - not ethnicity. 

The primary criterion is academic achievement, which the authors controlled for. The personal statement is a pretty brief appended section, and is not that heavily weighted by admission. Besides, the claim that an ethnic minority candidate is going to have significantly worse personal statement when they are otherwise academically identical to a non-minority candidate is a strong one. Do you have any evidence whatsoever for that claim?

Go read a few historical documents. The land called Palestine was a Jewish state when the Romans were about and the Muslim faith had not yet come into existence. It has been called many things; and Palestine is taken from what the Greeks called it. 

People who call themselves Palestinians today are not of that area for the most part. They were from all over the Ottoman Empire. 

Those little bits of no-mans land where Palestinians set up refugee camps after Arabs attacked Israel after it was set up in 48 are not ""Palestine"". They're no mans land. And no one gave a shit about them until the 60s when Israel started expanding into that no-man's land filled by refugees from the war when the Arabs tried to destroy Israel but lost.  

The plight of those people is awful. But to be honest; they shouldn't fucking be there. 

The Arabs lost their Ottoman Empire, became nation states, and wanted only Arab controlled nation states in the area. But Palestine (or whatever you want to call the area depending on what era of history we're talking about) has changed hands many times and the descendents of the Ottomans who are in the West Bank or Gaza strip have no more right to the land than the Jews living in a nationstate on part of the land. 

So basically its revisionist lefty nonsense to say Palestinians have a longer history in that land than the Jews simply because they took on the name of what the Greeks called that land before Muslims existed.

Why are **you** allowed to play something for free, and then only pay for it if you happen to like it? Why do you get to use it for free, then decide if its worthy of your money? THats not how the world works. You might want it to work like that. But it doesn't (yet).

Can you go into a cinema, but only pay for the ticket retrospectively if you like it? Can you use DVDs, watch box sets, but only buy them if you like them? Using your same analogies, I can't watch all the (EDIT - Live) BBC I want, then pay the TV license after the fact if I happen to like what I see. The radio is funded by ads and fees...its **already paid for**. You don't *need* a tv license to listen to the radio, and non BBC stations are advert/investor/sponsor funded. Again. Its paid for. Its not the same.

You admit yourself, you don't do it now that sales are so prevalent. SO it was just a case of ""I'm not paying that much, I'll just pirate it"". Again, I ask, why are **you** allowed to do that? Just say it how it is, you did it because you *can* not because its *right*. These are luxury entertainment products, not utilities guaranteed to us by our human rights.

And anyway...

&gt; But if you don't like something for nothing, then don't listen to the radio, and buy your music randomly. Also, if you don't have sky or cable, only watch BBC, and pay your TV license. And if somebody offers you a sample of something in CostCo, run away, they are the devil.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;This is exactly what you said.

Correct. I was illustrating how children will make childish decisions.

&gt;We absolutely are.

For no real reason, considering the subject being discussed.

&gt;Just because a child lives in a first world country doesn't mean they are well off, look at the statistics for the poverty line in the UK and US, and you'll see that a shocking percentage of children have parents who can't afford to feed them.

Shocking if it wasn't already widely-known. And ultimately, beside the point (unless you're suggesting that the console-owning, gaming kids are far outnumbered). Alternatively, for your point to have any weight, you'd be inferring that poor kids in the UK won't have a console in the first place, and won't be exposed to the same adverts for stuff they can't afford, leading to piracy....which (because that's obviously not true) kind of enforces my point.

&gt;Not to mention the social pressures that exist, due to the juxtaposition of middle class and poverty stricken children in the educational system. Not to mention the ostracism that poorer children can face through being excluded from the schoolyard zeitgeist.

Again, these things reinforce the desire-aspect I was touching on in relation to kids not making adult decisions and actually reinforces my point.

&gt;Erm, I'd like to see some statistics on that

[This is not news](http://www.stratoserve.com/2011/06/entertainment-video-game-industry-three-times-music-and-double-movie-industry.html). I got that from googling 'movie music industries combined gaming'. You really need to do more research.

&gt;If you don't believe that there are impoverished people in the UK, then you've got your head buried in the sand.

Where did I say there were no impoverished people in the UK? 

&gt;Yeah, okay, how about children IN THE UK who are being married off to relatives in Pakistan, or children of drug addicts and alcoholics who don't get fed outside of free school meals? What about victims of abuse who grow up really fucking quick.

And that's the norm, is it? This isn't an issue where if you can give any kind of example, the rest don't count. You really need to do more research.

&gt;Of course I know of some children who have different priorities, but I also know of children who don't.

Sure, I know of boys that don't play football, but it would be silly to say that most boys don't play football, despite the fact that they do. That's the logic you're using. You really need to do more research.

&gt;You're the one making blanket statements about what children want

Blanket statements to you, common knowledge to the advertising, gaming, music and movie industries. And a lot of parents. You really need to do more research.

&gt;but I also know of children who don't. 

Until my link, you didn't even know the size of the industry being discussed and even argued against it. You really need to do more research.

&gt;You can't just make accurate blanket statements about what is right and what is wrong.

So far, your examples to the contrary haven't changed that. And they're not statements unique to me, either - why do you think no shops have any dresses from Disney's Frozen? Are the reasons behind that changed by poor children existing elsewhere in the world? You really need to do more research.

&gt; It's just arrogant

Arrogant is equating that poor kids in the UK have anything like the hardship that poor kids have elsewhere in the world - especially when it has nothing to do with the gaming kids we're talking about....and yet despite obvious evidence to the contrary, you're still using them to dispute a successful business model of gaming and advertising that's thirty years old - despite my original point being that the said business model is morally wrong.

And nothing new.

The central tackling issue regarding Stam is apocryphal. Jaap Stam made very few tackles at *any* stage of his United career. He was so quick and strong that he didn't need to. 

Ferguson had the arse about him for non-football reasons, so when he came back from his achilles injury and Ferguson thought he had lost some of that infamous pace (which he had) he made the rash - and incorrect - decision to sell him. 

The whole idea that Ferguson made his decision based on ""less"" involvement due to Stam making less tackles is TOTAL fucking bollocks. 

Especially when you consider he replaced Stam - one of the greatest defenders to ever play for United - with the clearly-past-his-best Laurent Blanc, who even at his peak hardly ever tackled, and had no pace, and was entirely about using his experience to move into space and intercept danger before it happened.

And Liverpool's greatest central defender couldn't tackle his way out of a wet Echo. And wasn't the quickest or strongest. He didn't like heading much either.

So good managers and knowledgable fans know that tackling isn't a pre-requisite. But to claim it is somehow an outmoded neanderthal skill is also total rubbish. Hansen didn't do any of the ""dirty work"" because he knew Lawro would.

And equally, most great teams have someone who can do it brilliantly. I don't recall anyone saying Javier Mascherano should play more like Xabi Alonso when he was with us. And ""bark"" less. Or indeed when he was making so many amazing tackles and interceptions at the World Cup, in which he was one of the best players out there.

As for ""In top-level football, a clean sheet or zero goals conceded is more valuable than scoring a single goal"", erm. No. You can't win if you don't score at least one goal.

Machine learning also uses many generative models, but I'm not sure if traditional statistics has purely discriminative models. 

It depends on the size of your training set too - as even if you are only interested in classification, although discriminative models have a lower asymptotic error (that is, they are better in the limit of infinite data) the generative models approach their asymptotic error much faster, and so may out perform discriminative models at classification tasks when you have 'small data'.

true,ikkleste,eng-yorkshire,Something like Yorkshire,"&gt; If I was starting out now I'd sit back, rent, and wait. Sooner or later this bubble will burst. It should have in 2008 but it didn't. However, it will.

People have been saying the same thing for 10+ years though. And it just keeps getting bigger, and harder to buy. There are people who've been waiting tall their adult lives for this bubble to burst, and are now in their mid 30s. And your advice is keep waiting how long for? What if we get another partial burst like 2008? Keep waiting for the reinflation of a new bubble and third burst? Will that be another 5 years? More?

It's alright saying wait, the prices will come down, but life is short, and the time scales we are talking about are significant in terms of peoples lives.
 At some point you've got to have sympathy for them saying fuck it, I need a home, I want a place where i can raise a family, it might not be the sensible financial situation but people have lives to lead, and you can't blame them for wanting to lead them.

I'm not saying your wrong. But this is a horrific situation for a lot of people. The south can't afford to buy, the north can't afford to sell (I'm in negative equity already, there is no sign of this new bubble here, but you can bet when it bursts we'll still feel the fall out and that scares the shit out of me).",0,1406113925,null,0,1406114572,0,cj5cyyr,t3_2bdsde,t1_cj5cyyr,t1_cj4licq,null,1434856489,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

""We are ready"". 

The journalists stop their chatter, and a few begin rummaging through laptop bags to find their dictaphones, others just load up an app. A moment later, Bobby emerges from behind a curtain wearing nothing but his legendary brown shoes and a black pair of Speedo's. He bends down, and begins untying his laces.

""Ladies and Gentleman of the press, I am no longer Bobby Brown shoes"". Roberto removes those wonderful shoes, and places them on the table. 

""I am now Bobby Black Shirt"". With a puff of smoke and a flash of a strobe light, Bobby is wearing a beautiful, full black Everton kit, with matching black shoes and shades. The sharp contours of the shirt shows off his abs, and his strongly, gentlemanly package is still visible under the well fitting shorts. The gaffer is looking boss. 

""To celebrate, I brought some friends along""

Lukaku, Bony, Konoplyanka, Besic, That Belgian Kid, Adama Traore, Bacca, Atsu, Galloway, Cerci and Adriano all walk out in the same black kit, and present Bobby with a beautiful pair of hand crafted brown shoes, with Lukaku saying ""You will always be Bobby Brown Shoes, even with a black shirt- we are your brown shoe army and will fight to the death for your honor"".

The crowd of journalists, many in tears, begin to applaud at the beautiful, sentimental presentation. When the applause reaches its peak Bill shows his face and says loudly:

So only one of us is apparently allowed to indulge in pointless speculation, it would seem.

&gt;your literacy (or lack thereof) is the issue here. Also there us no such thing as a degree in comprehension

One of us has quoted the other all the way through. The other has made statements at odds with the reply, without quoting. Enough times that it's apparent what's going on.

&gt;Also there us no such a thing as a degree in child psychology. Nice try, alas.

If you're daft enough to insist on a child psychology degree for describing something as basic as advertising, you need a degree in comprehension created especially for you. Bonus literacy points for 'Also there us no' - what was that you were saying about literacy?

&gt;You said earlier that children are forced to watch adverts

Correct.

&gt;now you say that they choose to watch the adverts because its interesting to them and more convenient than going to do something else while the ads are on.

No, I didn't and don't say that. There is no 'now', nothing has changed. Quote, it'll save you so much time. 

&gt;So which is it? Do they watch the adverts because they want to, or because they are forced to?

Which part of 'advertising is forced' is puzzling to you? Do you think forced-ads at the start of DVD's are there specifically (and only) for you to go do something else? Do you think that anyone in that situation will *always* decide to do something else? This is how advertising works, and for kids it's even worse - there will be adverts for toys and stuff that they *want to see*, even though they'd have rather carried on watching Scooby Doo, which is why the BBC is such a godsend - it offers the only kids channels with no advertising, no tie-ins and so on. The problems start once they want to watch non-BBC content, like Ben 10 or My Little Pony, which have banner ads for websites and such *within the program* (The Simpsons movie even made fun of the banner ads) - and, of course, the break-ads which, for your suggestion to have any weight, every child would have to walk away from. Every single time. Everywhere. Does that sound like the norm?

&gt;:^) helps if you're consistent if you want to sound clever, mate.

Why not quote, then you'll actually have to address the replies and not somehow misinterpret each reply so that I have to keep correcting you. To do otherwise comes across as distinctly not-clever and is a trick that's older than reddit. Mate :-)

The southern part of the county is pretty rural, touching Herefordshire &amp; Gloucestershire, and has beautiful scenery and great walking. The north of Worcestershire is slowly becoming a suburb of Birmingham, Bromsgrove &amp; Redditch are both basically commuter towns for Brum itself.

Music Scene is actually really good; there's a huge amount of local bands playing local pubs somewhere around; being a University City Worcester has a large number of students and therefore a lot of diverse clubs/music venues (Marrs Bar &amp; Heroes used to be my favourite). 

Again if you are living near to the City itself biking is definitely an option and there are cycle paths that litter the County, however there's a decent enough bus &amp; train service if you have to venture a little further. Basically if you are within cycling distance of a railway station you will be fine without a Car for 90% of your needs.

Secondly, getting those grades shows that you'll have the prerequisite knowledge for the course when you arrive, but says little about how you'll perform on the course, where the style of teaching is rather different. The interview tends to present you with some problems more in the style of university tutorials, to see how you approach that, and they might also give you a written test more in the style of university exams to see how that goes too.

Admittedly there's probably also some tendency for interviewing to spread downwards through the league tables, as universities who probably could infer more from the information on the application form think ""well Cambridge interviews everyone, so we will too because that's how people will know we're good"".

Some very over-subscribed courses are starting to experiment with allocating places randomly among the applicants who are otherwise equally qualified.

That being said, a declining Gerrard is still phenomenal. Probably better than most holding midfielders last year, and he was getting used to a new position. Hi passing is still great and he still has the quality for the starting XI. Still had plenty of quality last season, and I expect nothing less than that this season. The signings of Lallana and Can, in my opinion, are perfect because they are reminiscent of the best of what Stevie has to offer in two players. Quality attacking and scoring ability from Lallana, and great defensive play, and amazing work rate and stamina from Can.

If we talk about government before 1900, do we talk about 'super-super-right' and 'super-kinda-right', or do we use Left and Right to refer to the general attitude of the population.  Much like the terms 'liberal' and 'conservative', the meaning changes depending on the time.  19th century liberals were far more conservative than even the most hardcore conservatives today, but they were liberal for the time, so we still refer to them that way.  A 'liberal' in Saudi Arabia might be a hardline 'conservative' in the UK.

true,deskamess,null,null,"On your last sentence I do not disagree with what you have said, but it got me thinking. What if you look at it like this:



1) If a team does not concede a goal there are two possible outcomes:

- A draw [0-0] (1 point)

- A win [1-0] (3 points)

Average: [1 * 0.5 + 3 * 0.5] = 2 points /game if you do not concede. The assumption I have made here, and am open to criticism on this, is that each outcome is equally likely [0.5]). 

In an imaginary 30 game season that is 60 points.



2) If a team scores a goal, there are three possible outcomes:

- A loss [the other team scores more than you, say 1-2 ]  (0 points)

- A draw [1-1] (1 point)

- A win [1-0] (3 points)

Average: [0.33 * 0 + 0.33 * 1 + 3 * 0.33] =&gt; 1.33 pts/game. Again, please note the previous stated assumption. 

In an imaginary 30 game season that is 40 points.


So you can lose a game even if you score, but you can never lose a game if you do not concede (=&gt; guaranteed points). Clean sheets get you a point; scoring may not always do that.


I think a better model would be to weight the point based on non-equal outcomes. Perhaps team data shows that historically (or the last two seasons) if you score at least 1, then there is a 40% chance of winning (instead of the 33.3% I used). Or from the other side, if you did not concede there was 60% chance of winning the game. Each team would have their own ""weight"" profile based on their history.

I worked for a temporary work agency for a while where young lads and middle aged men recently made redundant would all do manual labour jobs around factories and companies. Out of my few months rotating in I worked with in excess of 20 different white British workers and 1 Serbian.
There was no discernable difference between the work ethic of the British workers and the Serbian (despite the man being a 6'5 monster). Bare in mind this was jobs such as unloading lorries and sweeping floors for weeks on end.

The problem was that the mass influx of workers from abroad made permanent roles far harder to get. They probably pay the same wage to the migrants but they have the added bonus of the factors I mentioned below.

Forget the tired, out-of-touch and posh view that 'working class Brits are lazy'. These guys worked hard in shit jobs. Remember that these Brits cannot move to Germany or Romania for work, they dont have the money.

Perhaps it shouldn't be ""stealing our jobs"" but rather ""immigrants have made unskilled labour jobs more scarce and with higher competition"". It is simple to fix it.

&gt; the law is quite clear that it refers to a person who ""is, or appears to be"" under the age of 18

The key bit that you're missing is that it is someone who appears to be under 18 ""[from the evidence as a whole](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1978/37/section/2)."" The defence's position was that the vast majority of the evidence pointed to the people being over 18 (i.e. it was a perfectly normal site, using standard terms for people over 18 and so on), and that the prosecution had little evidence to the contrary (I'm not sure if they even identified specific images or performers/models).

Further, the defence argued that it should be fairly easy for the CPS or police (and a lot harder for the defence, due to not having the same resources or authority) to check how old the performers were - as the defence were eventually able to do.

It concludes:

&gt;'In relation to the probability of an application yielding an offer, this study 
confirms that some black and minority groups appear to be disadvantaged in 
the allocation of higher education offers. Applications made by candidates 
from Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Black African, Indian, Black Caribbean, Chinese 
and various ‘other’ groups were all found to be less likely to yield an offer than 
those made by white British candidates, controlling for a range of relevant 
variables including academic attainment. There was, however, no evidence 
that any apparent biases are stronger in higher status than lower status 
institutions. 

The evidence seems to point that many ethnic minority groups are less likely to be made an offer despite controlling for academic attainment, type of schooling, family background etc. Quite simply, if a white british national applied to a university, and a black person applied to a university, if they had exactly the same CV's, schooling, academic success etc, the white person would statistically be more likely to get an offer. It makes sense given the context of this sort of research, it's been shown 'foreign sounding' names do less well in job applications than names typical for a British national.

From a production stand point the Time War was written in as a convenient plot point to deal with all to discontinuity of the old series.  In order to make a Sci-Fi show these days you need continuity, or your fan base rejects it.  This wasn't something they necessarily did in the old series.

true,LimitlessLTD,eng-Surrey,Surreeh,"&gt; That's fine but then we shouldn't give free care to people in car crashes - drivers know the risks and why should non-drivers have their tax pounds.

Using a car is an extremely efficient use of time compared to a bicycle or walking for a large percentage of the population. The risks of actually being injured in a crash are negligible and the economic benefits to society from using cars far outweigh the cost of health care.

&gt; Or smoking?

Smoking is an addiction as well as being ingrained within our culture. The government does spend large amounts of money on both drinking and smoking awareness campaigns. If you havent noticed the government has banned smoking in public places, banned smoking advertisements, placed large noticeable health warnings on packets and now has ordered them to be kept out of site in super markets.

Drinking on the other hand (being the second most expensive thing for the NHS to cover) has not been hit so hard, this is mainly because culturally and historically drinking has been part of who we are as people for a long time and discouraging that is seen as detrimental to our heritage. (or something along those lines)


Also please dont make silly points about you playing water polo, it is not even in the same league cost wise. As well as, this doing exercise actually REDUCES your burden on the NHS, so your point is entirely redundant.

&gt; Overeating and being obese isn't my choice of hobby, but then I expect the NHS to bail me out when my like choices have health impacts.

I would to, if your life choices where un-informed or the risks small and the rewards of doing those choices are worth it. But when people are told repeatedly that their habits are killing them and those warnings are ignored that is where i draw the line. If you expect to be covered but dont do as your doctor says then you dont deserve the health care.

If someone started cutting off their limbs would you expect the NHS to pay for multi million pound prosthetics? Because that is what you are advocating here, Obesity is (in almost all cases) not an addiction, im not denying it doesnt exist as an addiction, but those cases are few and far between. It is laziness or lack of understanding or a mixture of both.

&gt; Congrats by the way, I imagine it feels a lot better to have dumped the weight!

true,beyondReturn,null,null,"BR is someone who will probably go on for years before he truly receives the respect he deserves. People always resort to calling him Brent, but he is a guy that is always looking to improve so he doesn't bring with him experience in everything. He was pretty much excluded from football at highest level for decades after his injury and had to study and learn from youths.  
He doesn't have much experience in boardroom politics or ""culture"". He is the kind of guy who probably read a lot of self improvement books when he was younger, always trying to get ahead and when he finally arrives he does everything to remain. People expect charismatic and witty manager, or boring and lacking manager that should be somewhere midtable. 
  
He got backslash from ""being: liverpool"" and decided to change his approach to talking, he talks less about himself and his ideas and just assumed they are correct these days. He is confident in his style of play and management that he doesn't feel the need to justify it anymore. I mean after decades of preparations he was fired from the job he coveted the most and from that shock he grew and learned a lot in terms of beings honest with yourself. His ideals were proven wrong and he changed and became better manager for it.
  
At Swansea he saw his ideas work in a club that was already playing with that style, and when he moved to Liverpool he again had to prove himself, it wasn't enough to just improve the style, he had to feed the media and fans to buy time. So he got a lot of shit for talking too much (you have presumably seen that people talk a lot more when they are nervous than when they are comfortable in their silence). Now that he has shown results with LFC his confidence is up there again and he can work without sounding like a salesman. 
  
If you imagine Brendan as a guy who ended his career when he was 20 and had to do everything the hard way in order to get here, then his lack of experience, his first real realization of how football works after being fired from the club he loved, writing a huge dossier to sell his ideas, his salesman speak all make sense. Now below all that there is the guy who genuinely wants to improve players and not always because they profit him, he talks to younger players like they were his kids and is very soft on them (read the interview with Roy H. when Liverpool lost after he started bunch of young players).
 
He is also self improving, some will call him superficial for fixing his teeth, but the same ones wouldn't mind it if he was some average guy. He puts in a lot of work to run marathons and work out in general, and all of this is lost to people. Can you imagine finding time for those things when you have millions of people on your back and more wanting you to fail?

Wrong. Chalobah was at Chelsea since he was 11, and only went out on loan when he was 18. Three years between the ages of 15 and 21 there, so he's HG once he turns 21.

So... we found that the UK price of a Samsung 65H8000 TV is £3299, compared to the US price of £2544.

 but I first heard it 20 odd years ago. Always makes me laugh.


It's business as usual for a bartender, and one day as he is cleaning his bar when an unusual customer walks in. The man is dressed in an expensive suit, has a beautiful supermodel hanging off each arm, and has a limo parked outside. Furthermore, the man has an orange for a head.
The customer sits down at the bar and orders everyone a drink. He pays for it from a roll of hundreds and manages to get the attention of every woman in the joint, despite having an orange for a head.
The bartender is not a man to pry, but he feels compelled to ask about this man's life.
""Excuse me,"" says the bartender, ""I can't help but notice that you're obviously fabulously wealthy and irresistable to women, but you have an orange for a head. How did that happen?""
So the man told his story.
""A while back, when I was penniless, I was walking along the beach and saw an old lamp, half buried in the sand. I picked it up and gave it a clean, and POOF! out popped a genie. The genie explained that he had been trapped in that lamp for two hundred years, and that he was so grateful to me for freeing him that he would give me three wishes.
""For my first wish I asked for an unlimited fortune. The genie said 'It is done!' and from then on, whenever I needed money, it was there.
""For my second wish I asked for the attention of all the most beautiful women in the world. The genie said it was done, and since then I have been able to get any woman I wanted.

Because MS Office is expensive. I resent paying £100 just so I can read that thing someone sent me in MS Publisher format; or nearly £300 so I can work with your Visio diagram.

It's an open format with proprietary extensions. Some of it still has to be reverse-engineered or guessed.  
It's readable, mostly; but not so easily writable.

Libre Office has made cross-compatibility improvements with the word processor, but passing OOXML spreadsheets between Libre Office and MS Office is still broken for all but the simplest spreadsheets.

Whereas the older .doc and .xls formats have been around long enough for most of the problems to have been fixed.

Anyone who couldn't figure that out from the Tweet should be jailed. I honestly don't think 'offended' actually exists. It's a news narrative for views, I don't mean in the ""zomg evil corporations maaan!' sense, just literally.

Have you ever actually talked to someone who got offended? Have you read the comment section on any site reporting this type of bullshit? The comments are ALWAYS supportive of the speaker, telling imaginary people to stop being offended by everything they read. If everyone is telling each other to stop being offended, who is actually offended? No one.

Technically pay as you go (meaning you put credit on and are charged for every text / phone call / megabyte)

However they have one-month [deals](http://giffgaff.com/goodybags) where you pay up front for *much* cheaper service.  e.g. £12 per months gets you unlimited data and texts, and generous minutes.  The one problem is the ""unlimited data"" deals aren't supposed to be used for tethering, and I know they try to detect it

Assuming tethering isn't an issue, that has the advantages of a very good base price, plus no contract lock-in

In general, there's no fees for roaming, but calls and texts are likely to cost more (and you won't be able to use your free allowances), and data is likely to bankrupt you.

The can and this is exactly what the EU offers. They would have trouble moving to ""expensive"" countries, but I imagine they would easily move to Romania and last there for much longer with only some savings.

&gt;The problem was that the mass influx of workers from abroad made permanent roles far harder to get

The problem I see is that the EU group (Poles) increased UK's population by around 1%. It's quite a number when you say 600k more people but is 1% such a big increase? Especially taking into account the fact that their numbers pretty settled (not that they increase all the time and by large numbers).

Certainly 1% doesn't seem massive but you are forgetting the impact on low population density areas like East Anglia where increase in unskilled labour will impact more than Birmingham.

Immigration debate is Healthy! Especially when we are living in a period of massive youth unemployment and job uncertainty where zero hour contracts are on the rise. The answer to cure unemployment is not to label everyone as workshy. It is not to label everyone as shit workers. And the media need to recognise that debate on immigration doesn't mean that racists want to kick every Eastern European out the country.

Their methodology is to predict rejection rates based academic and social backgrounds and then compare that to the ""raw difference"" in rates students from different ethnic groups experience. They show that while these models do predicted a higher rate of rejection than that experienced by white British students, they're still lower than those experienced by students of other ethnicities.

My argument was, for students with similar academic backgrounds, those students who made more ambitious applications would receive more rejections, and if the distribution of applications was associated with ethnicity, then this could explain some of the ethnic differences in rejection rates.

Reading the briefing, they've run their models for each group of university, and for each group, their models still aren't explaining the differences in rejection rates each ethnic group experiences, it hints that the differences are similar for all groups.

They also show a breakdown of applications to each group of universities from each ethnic group, and it shows that Bangladeshi and Pakistani students actually make fewer applications to elite universities, while also receiving a higher rate of rejections.

At some point, perhaps the Jews were.  But today, Islam, and radical Islam in particular, seems to threaten Western civilization most of all.

true,MHaaskivi,null,null,"I think there are lots of problems when it comes to trying to incorporate a ""Moneyball""-esque philosophy into football.

First, baseball has so few players involved in each play. On a typical line-out, there are really only three people: pitcher, hitter, and fielder. Basemen are in there too, of course, and some plays involve more, but it's much easier to track data when everything starts at the same point and (generally) ends at the same point.

There really is no such thing in football, and there are legitimate things that players can do that can impact the game without them ever touching the ball. Further, every player is in play at all times, and little changes to position way off the ball can effect things later on. And unlike basketball (where you can single out things like Shane Battier being on the court correlating to other players being ""less good""), there are only three subs; there's no way to even pick out trends without excessivley complicated metrics.

Further, the positions in soccer are incredibly fluid when compared to baseball and basketball. Look at all the ways you can play on the wing: you can cut in on your inside foot, you can sit and distribute, you can get to the byline, you can cross it from the top of the box, you can track back...how do you account for all of those variations effectively? And just because a player hasn't done something in the past, does that mean that he can?

Add into it the fact that, for the most part, you're trying to find value by going to leagues that aren't set up to keep advanced statistics because of the costs involved. In Moneyball, they identify talent based on their college stats, which are kept by the NCAA; there's no equivalent system here, so you may not have great stats on the second tier of the Croatian league or Ghana's first division.

You also run into a data collection issue. Data collection in soccer is incredibly expensive and time consuming, and without good data on a massive scale Moneyball falls apart. It's one thing to keep data on all thirty MLB teams and their AAA affiliates; that's doable, and the statistics actually tell a story if you know where to look. The stats can much more easily lie in soccer, and when you base your entire transfer policy around stats it confuses things.

Frankly, I'm not even sure what currency they evaluate players in soccer on. In baseball, the only finite number is outs, so they have things ranked based on how many outs each play is worth, and they have set numbers of runs each player is worth over the course of a season. In soccer, the finite number is just time, and the scoring is so low that goals aren't a good measure (fractions of goals become fluky and not predictive, I'd imagine).",0,1406126598,null,0,false,0,cj5hab6,t3_2bhg6j,t1_cj5hab6,t3_2bhg6j,null,1435465935,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

It IS discriminatory but where I said I back it up? I've only said that when discussing a problem we should take into account ALL the facts. Even if only 1% of Brits are ""lazy"" that is still a 1% too much or such at least should be taken into account when talking about other possible issues.

&gt;It is said to be closer to 800,000 in 2008 by the 'The Polish Migrants' website.

According to [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poles_in_the_United_Kingdom#cite_note-2010_estimates-22) and the fact they've based it on ONS report, there were 515k Poles in UK in 2010, although unofficial sources indicate the number may be even 1mln.... but that is unofficial. Even though, the numbers are 1-1.5% of UK's population.

&gt;Certainly 1% doesn't seem massive but you are forgetting the impact on low population density areas like East Anglia where increase in unskilled labour will impact more than Birmingham.

[EU migrants 'settling across UK'](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7373552.stm) - *Eastern European nationals have settled more widely throughout the UK than has happened during previous waves of migration, research suggests.*

It seems too often people forget about free market laws. If there aren't good job prospects in an area, then that areas will simply NOT attract as many migrants as other places. After all, they just moved a country, so why would they bother staying in certain place where it's hard to find a job?

&gt;The answer to cure unemployment is not to label everyone as workshy. It is not to label everyone as shit workers.

Exactly BUT also not to brand all migrants as ""taking our jobs"", ""working below NMW"", ""reducing wages"".

Some migrants can very well do the above but what is their actual number and how does this affect the rest of the population. The same can be said about ""lazy"" Brits, some certainly exist but how many of them there are and how is this relevant with the discussion on immigration.

P.S. The unemployment is already at pretty low level and decreases all the time, even though there are so ""many"" EU and non-EU migrants.",0,1406127198,null,0,false,0,cj5hkvz,t3_2bhhe0,t1_cj5hkvz,t1_cj5h1vo,null,1434858682,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It sounds like she expects to be scheduling you for 17.5 hours of work, but reserves the right to not schedule you at all if work is slack.  On the upside, this also makes it easy to shift your work around depending on what's going on in your life (just ask to not be scheduled on a certain date). On the downside, you might not have a reliable money source.

I used to work in McDonalds; nearly everyone was technically on a zero-hours contract because they changed their availability all the damn time.  During term-time they might be available some nights and only want to work 2, then it's holiday time and they can work any time on 3 specific days and any mornings the other 4 and want 5 shifts, then it's the new term and their timetable has changed so they want one long shift on a specific day, etc. etc. etc.

This worked because *the store was perpetually busy*.

Also, make sure you check what's available to you AFTER whatever college course you are looking at. I spent 8 months doing an access course that the college told me would feed directly into the one of the local uni's programmes only for the university to tell me that there was no way that the two were compatible and that I had to do another year of their own introduction programme.

Another option might be to look at Open University courses. You are completely in charge of your study schedule, so if you have a part time job it can work out really well and you can keep earning, and they do courses at different levels so you aren't necessarily committing to a full degree just by dipping your toe into the water.

It's unlikely, bar a miracle - that Vorm will be first choice. He's not been signed for that purpose. He's been signed as a Lloris ''lite'' for backup. So no, it's basically the fact our 2nd GK is 43 for fucksakes, and I doubt will be playing much at all apart from those marketing/friendly games boosting our rep in the States (lots of potential fans to tap into after the WC) - so just an ambassadorial role. I doubt he'd play competitive, if at all - which is fine, as he's probably lost some relfexes and agility. Probably since the US/World Cup business more fans might be looking for a club to support - Friedel is perfect to have in and around the team. So our real ''2nd choice'' keeper, is Jordan Archer who has played 0 First Team games, and has had medicore loans at Bishops Stortford and Wycombe. So he's not near a 2nd keeper either. 

Vorms PoV --- Swansea just signed a new GK. Yes, he's a great GK who I thought at one stage was one of the most solid keepers in the prem, but is likely to play much more with us during our early Cup/Europa games than he will if Swansea rotated him a bit. Plus, more cash is always nice. So it's win win for him &amp; us.

These guys will probably be our most exciting players. Expect them to run at/past the defense and then play someone through on goal. They all have good pace and ball control and can turn away from their marker and set up the next attack. Excited for me is an understatement, I think we're really well set up in this part of the pitch for next season.

But like everyone else has said, as it's a friendly, the result doesn't matter too much. Rodgers uses these games to get the players fitness up to where it should be after the summer break.

true,LFCCalgary,null,null,"This is a good point and I wanted to touch on alternative formations in my original post but it was getting long. 

Just to touch on a couple of points you mentioned, I think you need to look at the two strikers in a 4-4-2 a little differently than the lone striker in a 4-3-3. 

The way I see it, the two striker positions aren't the same. In the first position I'd have Sturidge, Lambert and Remy as you suggested, but for the second striker position I'd include Sterling and maybe Markovic in addition to those three. My reasoning is that as a lone striker, Sterling and Markovic would be considered out of position. But along side a striker they would be far more comfortable (definitely Sterling, I'm assuming Markovic is similar).  

In a two striker system, you'd definitely want one of your actual strikers to fill up one of the positions, hence why I only listed the three for the first position. But the second striker position is far more flexible IMO. 

With this reasoning we would still have 5 players for those two positions. So depth is there. 

But having said that, you obviously can't plan for everything. The 3-5-2 for example. I would never suggest we need 7 CBs just in case we want to switch to 3 at the back. 

In the end it is down to the manager to decide what formation is likely to be used the majority of the time. If, like last season we want to play two or three games with 3 at the back we are still capable of doing so with the current squad. You don't need depth for every position in a formation that will hardly be used. 

I'd imagine Rodgers would prioritize formations, with 4-4-2 diamond being second and 3-5-2 a distant third. As formations are lower priority, the depth required is diminished. ",0,1406130050,null,0,false,0,cj5j2ng,t3_2bfv8l,t1_cj5j2ng,t1_cj5ca9g,null,1434859468,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

It's not like the world is becoming smaller and we should be increasingly looking to prepare our children for a world with fewer boundaries and borders where communicating in *globally used languages* would be useful or anything like that. 

This article has some moments of comedy gold though. Thanks OP.

&gt; “People still speak Welsh?” is a common refrain all Cymrys living in England are accustomed to hearing

Is it though? Who doesn't know that the Welsh have their own language? Probably people who are not worth talking to.

&gt; Welsh evolved from Brittonic (meaning indigenous Breton, as opposed to Anglo-Saxon), and until the Romans came along, it was spoken in England too. The Welsh language is not a backwards, insignificant thing; it is a fundamental part of Britain’s collective history. 

Love that she fitted in that little dig about Anglo-Saxons as well. Gotta remind those English that they're not as British as the Welsh. 

&gt; Many will write this off as a ludicrous proposal, but in doing so they reveal, to quote Ramsay again, “something fascinating about the nature of British nationalism – how it is so ubiquitous as to be unnoticed; so hegemonic, as to go unchallenged.” After all, nobody would find it ludicrous to expect Welsh and Scottish schoolchildren to learn the English language and English history, and to imbibe English culture as a necessary result of its dominance.

Uhhh... this is going to sound provocative but that's a big part of what being a conquered people entails in the medieval age. To be brutally honest, compared to a lot of other geographically small European populations, Wales are fortunate that anything of their original culture survived that period of history. Something to be proud of.

&gt; If the British government really wants a United Kingdom, as it claims to, then it needs to give the other countries currently in the union an equal place. 

So we teach all the kids to speak English, Gaelic, Welsh and Scots Gaelic? This seems rather 'pie in the sky' to me. They're probably better off with German, Spanish or Mandarin. Even Russian.

&gt; To take a trivial example: the book and Twitter account Very British Problems portrays the British as socially awkward, Earl Grey-sipping Hugh Grant caricatures. But that’s not an image I recognise from Wales – it’s not even an image I recognise in a lot of England (try looking for a stiff upper-lip on a night bus in Liverpool). 

That's because the British aristocrats of the 19th and early 20th century (many of whom weren't even English - like the Irish Wellesley family) were out there in the world ordering people about and that's an image that stuck in the collective minds of other cultures.

The irony of you saying *I'm* on a high horse while telling me what my views are and how I'm personally damaging society with them is pretty rich. Dial down the hyperbole a notch, please.

This is a person who knew first hand what heroin could do to ravage a family, who was also a mother with small children to take care of, from an affluent family, who didn't want for anything and lived in luxury most of her life, choosing to take heroin. That is pretty much the definition of idiotic behaviour, don't you think? Or does the fact she was an addict mean that she is invulnerable to criticism of her choices? 

The idea that she wouldn't get treatment because people 'like me' would make her feel ashamed, despite *being the mother to two small children* is not a great argument in her defence. You don't think that kind of selfish behaviour is worthy of judgement? It's entirely acceptable to judge people on the choices they make, and while you don't choose to be addicted you absolutely choose whether to take the drug in the first place, and whether or not to get treatment.

*Plus let's face it*, your scenario in which she was coerced to take it is entirely unfounded in evidence but is very unlikely given her background, the friends she kept and the fact that she wasn't exactly living below the poverty line.

True, maybe it's to get more out of a Monaco switch (the only real other club I've seen linked heavilly after James left) and the agent will love dealing with sugardaddies. But I just don't see him wanting to move there. Sure they're french, but hardly a club are they? If he wants to play in front of like 15,000 people then meh.

I don't know the kid, and if hes' the type to go for the cash - but I could be wrong. At least this shows we are interested and judging from the Draxler/Depay rumours it suggests we're looking at that position heavily with a great player.

Torres simply isnt good enough, he fluffs chances so often i get nervous when a chance lands to him. i would rather it land to anyone else on the pitch really. He makes poor decisions, times when he could play someone in and just blazed it wide instead, because his so hungry for a goal it stops him making the right decision. The guy scores a pitiful amount of goals, he has been a curse on Chelsea since his arrival.

Torres has had plenty of chances to prove himself, plenty of minutes on the pitch when judging by his performances he hasn't really deserved them.
