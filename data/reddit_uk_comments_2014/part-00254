[Edit:  But for those who don't mind a bit of cherry picking.](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/quran/women/long.html)

We're talking about a religion where women aren't even protected from having their genitals cut off.  [One estimate is that 137,000 women in the UK have been subjected to the procedure.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-politics/10980268/FGM-affects-137000-women-in-England-and-Wales-reveals-shocking-new-study.html)

Also, Muslim culture often seems to treat non-believers with contempt.  White girls are seen as disposable sluts, not like the chaste pure women of Islam (who are still treated as second class citizens).

Sorry, but I think religion *is* a factor.  In the same way that Catholic dogma doesn't promote pedophilia and yet it produced a culture in which pedophiles were shielded, I think Islam has produced cultures in which women and non-believers can be treated like dirt with impunity.  How much of this can be traced directly back to the Quran and how much is due to standard religious tribalism and ignorance, I don't really care.

I don't think it's immutable though.  I actually have hope that Islam can be reformed and made more compatible with secular societies.  But it's going to require mammoth changes.

We too have a sporting rivalry within the city, although ours is between football (soccer) teams.

We 3 teams within 5 miles of each other, two of which play in the English Premiership, West Bromwich Albion (who technically are not in Birmingham but close enough) and Aston Villa. Sadly neither of these are anywhere near dominating on a national level, despite playing top flight football. And Birmingham City FC who now play in a lower league. 

The close proximity of the clubs result in some interesting conversations at work the morning after a local derby and even families can have split allegiances between the teams.

Thanks for the link to the Stephen Fry video, I recall seeing it when it was broadcast over here.

As for the term Brummies, due to Birmingham being the centre of a larger conurbation, The West Midlands. The name can only be used for around half the inhabitants of the area.

Neighbouring Birmingham is The Black Country. This is an area that includes towns such as Wolverhampton, Walsall, West Bromwich and Dudley and is the birthplace of the industrial revolution. I myself was born and raised in Walsall(5 miles from Birmingham).  

People from the Black Country can take great offence to being called Brummies, yet to the untrained ear we all sound alike (think Ozzy Osbourne) however there is actually a  huge difference in the accent. 

Folk from the Black Country are called 'Yam Yams' by Brummies due to the way that we talk... ""am yam gewin down the shop?"" is Black country for ""Are you going to the shop"" 

The accent is very sing song and amongst the older generations very thick, it has been hypothesised that it is probably the closest accent to that of William Shakespeare, however in the UK it is often the accent used to portray someone as a bit slow or thick in TV or film.

FGM is an African cultural issue, dating to back before Islam even existed.

The scum who are doing this to these girls would do the same to Pakistani or Asian girls if they had the chance, they just don't have the same opportunity to do so. My sister has been called by guys in cars whilst walking down the street with her scarf on. 

They take young impressionable girls and treat them the way they do because they can. They're disgusting opportunists. They don't do it because they think the religion allows them to. They 100% know what they're doing is wrong. Anybody who is brought up Muslim knows what's Halal and Haraam. It's what we're taught when we're growing up.

If they think the religion allows them to treat non-believers like dirt then why would they think the same religion allows them to have sex with them? 

The reason nobody speaks about it is because nobody knows about it until the media reports it. 

The guy in the video made the point about nobody reporting it when these girls are passed around, but if nobody is even aware it's happening how would they report it? The people they pass these girls on to aren't going to report it because they're just as guilty.

It doesn't make sense that it's turned into a religious issue when the perpetrators are so disconnected from their religion.

Why do I think this is credibly connected to Islam?  Because we see similar practices all over the Islamic world.  It's not just in (edit typo) Pakistan.  Women are treated abysmally and 'Kuffirs' are treated with contempt in many many distinct Islamic populations.

BTW, that doesn't mean I think all Muslims are misogynists or hate non-Muslims.  I'm well aware there are many many Muslims who are decent respectful people.  However, I think religion produces cultures which have a tendency for these things to happen.

&gt;If they think the religion allows them to treat non-believers like dirt then why would they think the same religion allows them to have sex with them?

Wut?  They were raping them.

&gt;if nobody is even aware it's happening how would they report it?

Because everyone knew.  This isn't like Jimmy Saville where many people (including me) had simply not heard the rumors.  In this case, everyone had heard the stories about Muslim rape gangs.  Everyone knew it was going on.  I imagine that practically every Muslim in Rotherham had some inkling.  To be honest, I think that practically every Muslim in the nation had heard something about sexual abuse committed by Muslims. 

Did everyone know precisely what was transpiring?  No, but that's not how these things work.  People learn not to ask questions and not to put their nose where it doesn't belong.  Can't be held responsible if you don't know for sure, right?

The train gives you quick and easy access to major historic / touristy cities like Edinburgh, Durham and York.  Hardly hidden gems but they would nonetheless be around the top of the list for day trips / weekends.  I believe Durham Cathedral was used as a location in Harry Potter, not that it needs such associations to be worth your visit!  As for less obvious historical sites there are far too many to list here really, perhaps check out organisations like the National Trust and English Heritage / Historic Scotland / Cadw.

For nature and hiking the surrounding coast and countryside of the NE (Northumbria, Teesdale etc) is very nice and rather underrated - it might actually quality as a genuine ""hidden gem"" (there aren't many in a country this old and densely and heavily touristed, to be honest).  However without a car it will not be very easy to explore.

They likely see it as an embarrassment and they want to protect their religion.  Are they angry?  Probably, but they're not going to give outsiders the satisfaction of admitting to them that there's something deeply wrong with the state of Islam.

British Muslims have cultivated a deep victimization complex.  They fret endlessly about 'Islamophobia' and the possible racist motivations of those who criticize them.  They think that they're unfairly treated by the government and by the West in general.  They think that what's going on in Israel is an assault on Islam akin to a genocide or a holocaust.

And the Left is supporting them!  I'm left of center myself, but I find it truly scary how Muslims are being encouraged by the Guardian and others to act like they're perpetual victims of a racist society.

So yeah.  I think that many many Muslims are truly appalled by what's been going on in Rotherham.  But, does that mean any great soul searching is going to go on?  I doubt it.  I think that British Muslims are going to do what they normally do and claim that it's got nothing to do with Islam and that the real problem are the racists who want to use this incident as an excuse to bash their belief.

Of course it'd be an embarrassment to them. I agree that they won't give outsides the satisfaction.

I personally think that there have been too many provisions for multiculturalism. It was a good idea, but poorly executed. Everyone should have been on a level playing field. To someone, there are many conflicting things: too many things going on that piling this on adds to a backlog of things. 

It's unfortunate that there isn't a more mainstream and centralised (read vocal) voice; but that's not going to be possible with the complete decentralisation.

&gt; I don't know. That's up to UK Muslims to work out. I recommend defenestration.

I'm going to be careful with the word Imam. An Imam is usually one who leads a prayer (in a congregation), but can also (but may always be) a community leader and representative. The majority of Imams are able to do the former but not the latter (or they don't do it very well). The lack of cohesion here is concerning.

true,backtowriting,null,null,"Right.  The argument that bad people don't exist in religion because religion forbids people to do bad things.

But, religion manifestly *does* give rise to cultures where incredibly bad things become the norm.  ISIS is on the extreme end, but it is an example of what can go wrong when religion gets out of hand.

So how does it happen?  Well, firstly because religion tells people to abdicate thinking for themselves and to avoid asking too many difficult questions.  Secondly, it's based on nonsense.  And sometimes that nonsense can be harmless, but other times it can be incredibly dangerous.  Religion also creates a dangerous tribalism.  You're either part of the group or an outsider not to be trusted.  

Yes, religious texts have rules about doing the right thing, but *everyone* thinks they're doing the right thing!   Everyone can find justification for their actions within the pages of the Quran or the Bible.  

So why pick on Islam?  Why aren't I criticizing all religions equally?  Well, because it's Islam which is currently causing most of these problems.  Christianity used to suffer from practically all of the problems we see in Islam, but much of the Christian world went through a scientific enlightenment, such that nowadays, you'd be hard pressed to find a Christian redditor who claims to take his/her religious texts literally.

Now, I know when I write comments like this that I run a good risk of incurring bullying comments about fedoras and am told that I should scurry back to /r/atheism (a subreddit I don't post to BTW).  But, whatever.  I want to give my honest opinion.

&gt;We have consciences and we know the difference between right and wrong.

But you don't!  You may have a conscience, but, assuming you're religious, you have to rely on a religious text to tell you what's right and what's wrong.

But, neither do I always know what's right!  Would that we could all just look into our hearts and automatically always know the morally correct side to take, but it doesn't work like that.  I have to use *reason*.  I have to look at the arguments made for and against and think for myself which arguments I find most convincing.

You don't play an Number 10, AMC at MC (despite him insisting otherwise) and then judge him based on that. He was doing things in the German league, arguably tougher than in Holland that Eriksen was doing at Ajax. But lets put him at CM, then ridicule him for not being good enough, when some of the assists he's picked up for us from the AMC position are out of this world.

You have a *conscience* and you certainly have a consciousness.  But I think that religion *is* at odds with reason.  It's a different method for trying to get at the truth and I happen to think it's an inferior one.

Actually, I'm sure you *do* use reason.  You clearly use it in your comments.  But, to the extent that you rely on religious teachings you are abdicating thinking for yourself.

Edit:  I'm off to bed, but I'd like to sincerely thank /u/go-now- for debating me and explaining his/her perspective on things. 

I hope that my comments didn't come off as arrogant.  Yes, I try to rely on reason, but that doesn't mean I think I'm particularly good at it!  And yes, religious people can also use reason in addition to their religious teachings.  My point , somewhat clumsily made, is that reason and religion are two alternative ways of getting at the truth.  And I mean alternative.  I don't think that they compliment each-other.

Looks very much like Agger is being sold. We accepted an offer for Kolo and he turned it down, fair play to him. Couple of injuries and we'll need him desperately too. By the way, historically, centreback rotation has proven itself to be a horrible idea. You're much better off finding a partnership that works and sticking to it wherever possible.

Assaidi is on very low wages and not likely to get any gametime, he'll be sold as soon as someone meets our valuation. Stoke on deadline day looking very likely to me.

Coates was not bought with any thought of Suarez at all. At the time he seemed like one of the most promising CBs in the world, and he put in some great performances with us near the start of his time. Development wrecked by injuries, similarly to Kelly. We have no particular need to sell him, but again, he'll be gone once our valuation is met or his contract runs out.

I though this might have been interesting

But no. It was uniformed, boring drivel

Makes the major mistake of assuming rising number of catholics means rising number of nationalists (wrong), thinking that Ireland may want a unity (wrong) , calling Derry a 'former unionist citadel (so wrong and tell the unionists of that citadel he called it Derry). Also the phrase 'gerrymandered border' is used passively, feeling no need for explanation?

There was a lot of truth in it... but anything truthful was boring. the rest was England Centred UK drivel.

It imagines that if we decided to leave, we might just slip away into Ireland, ignoring any political context or implication Northern Ireland is involved in.

It is the worst piece of journalism I have ever read on Northern Ireland. Perhaps it is true that Northern Ireland could be let go much more easily than Scotland but a glance at a newspaper or history book shows that it's position in the UK is by no means as simple as put across in this article.

Northern Ireland and its position is difficult to write about. If you can't do it, please spare us.""

true,earlgrey1989,tardis,TARDIS,"I love Doctor Who and I'll never stop watching because it's the Doctor and his whole story is amazing.  With that in mind, I can say that Soren made a lot of true statements about Doctor Who in this video, summed up almost perfectly with the statement, ""You just want to write a wild west episode so that the Doctor can wear a cowboy hat."" It hits the nail right on.  It feels like they're writing Doctor Who now by saying, ""we want cyborgs, cowboys, the wild west, some stoic sayings, and a plot twist.  A Town Called Mercy!""  Times change and right now, it seems like Doctor Who is more about hype and superfanning than it is about the writing.  I've noticed people are waaaaaaay more interested in repeating certain catchphrases and antics (certain friends of mine can't stop repeating, ""bowties are cool,"" but can't talk to me about the episodes they liked, the best moments of the season, positives and negatives about a certain character, etc).  It seems a lot of episodes have been based solely on belabored buzz words, sayings, and tropes whereas the story takes a back seat. You'll find that my favorite part of Doctor Who is the story telling nature and how I feel it's become absent in recent episodes.

Having said that, there are a few arguments made by Soren and naysayers that I feel aren't valid.  The big one in my mind is continuity.  For all the episodes of Doctor Who I've seen, past and present, continuity was never an integral part of the show.  It's always been a show about exciting places around the universe or in history and elaborate adventures that challenge the Doctor's companions.  It's only been recently that continuity has now become a central focus of Doctor Who and people are aggravated when the sonic screwdriver sometimes can and/or can't do wood, or [a controversial event from season 6] (#s ""the Teselecta can apparently regenerate"") even though no cares (I certainly don't care) that the Doctor has apparently met Shakespeare for the first time twice or more (in the 1970s, Tom Baker offhandedly told Sarah Jane he's met Shakespeare, but then David Tennant acts as if he's never met Shakespeare before if I'm remembering correctly).  So I don't agree that a lack of continuity is a fault of Doctor Who – I consider part of its charm!

In my mind, the, erm, magic of Doctor Who is in the story telling of each episode.  Old episodes of Doctor Who are all about exploring the planets and people the Doctor and his companions encounter but currant Doctor Who is all about complex and twisting overarching plot lines.  Earlier, I said that times change and that's because right now, we have a head writer (Moffat) who doesn't seem to agree with me but I hope that the focus on story telling comes back in the decades to come.

So, as I said, I'll never stop watching the Doctor and his companions.  I'm more excited than I've been in YEARS for Peter Capaldi and Jenna Coleman, and I'm super excited to see what Season 8 brings.  I think Soren is right, though, and that the show is currently way more about hype and special effects, it's still a decent show at worst and a great one at best so regardless of the positives and negatives of Doctor Who, long may he live and long live Doctor Who.",0,1409371984,null,0,false,0,ck4e6o9,t3_2ewxlm,t1_ck4e6o9,t3_2ewxlm,null,1427287673,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

But on the youth development comment, it's a delicate balance. Chelsea still have to win trophies in order to stay at the top and bring money to operate at the top. As far as Bamford goes, he's 20 years old and nowhere near ready to lead our line. Adding to that, we only play one striker up top, so even if he stays, he'd likely get very few minutes and what he needs now more than anything is playing time and experience. Perhaps after a few years, he'll be good enough. Then again, perhaps not. You have to remember that Chelsea are in the top 5 to 10 clubs in the world right now and if you want to be in that 25-man squad, you have to be the best of the best. Not just good. These players get sold because they are simply not good enough for Chelsea. 

On a broader youth development note though, we are just beginning to see the products of our investment in the youth programs. Chelsea have not been at the top for as long as Arsenal, United, and Liverpool. Their youth programs have had a lot of time to recruit and development youngsters, where we are fairly new to this. Add that to name recognition. I'd say give it another 5 to 10 years before we truly have some top quality talent coming through the youth ranks and can start to fill our first time with them. That's been one of Jose's biggest ambitions since coming back, to build a real club, instead of one that buys all the time.

&gt; In 1981, the Moss Side area was one of England's inner city areas affected by a series of riots. Analysts trace the 1970s origins of Manchester's gang crime to social deprivation in the south-central part of the city — Hulme, Longsight and Moss Side — where the activity of the underground economy encouraged a trade in illegal narcotics and firearms contributing to Manchester's later nickname of ""Gunchester"".[6] ""Turf wars"" between rival drugs 'gangs', resulted in a high number of fatal shootings.[5] During what has been termed the Madchester phase of the history of Manchester, narcotic trade in the city became ""extremely lucrative"" and in the early 1990s a gang war started between two groups vying for control of the market inManchester city centre — the 'Cheetham Hill Gang' and The 'Gooch Close Gang', inCheetham Hill and Moss Side, respectively.[7]There were several high profile shootings associated with gangs and drugs in this area during the 1990s and into the 21st century.[6][8] The last gang related gun fatality in Moss Side was in 2006.[5] Aided by the work of Xcalibre, the Greater Manchester Police's task force, founded in 2004, and the multiagency Integrated Gang Management Unit, gang related shootings in the area have fallen by about 90% in recent years.

Stan Lee is usually around $80. So Matt Smith at $110 is very strange, it's way over the average, Patrick Stewart is there on Sunday, and I feel is a much bigger and accomplished and well known actor than Matt Smith, and he's charging (I believe) $80.

For me, that price is too high, I can purchase so many things with that. Last year I just did some quick shots of the celebs at their signing tables. Technically this is a no-no, but others were doing it, and it appeared no big deal... that was until I tried to take one of Stan Lee. This was apparently the line that was drawn in the sand.

This line itself is ironic; Miranda was raised for most of her life on an isolated island, and the only people she ever knew were her father and his servants, an enslaved savage, and spirits, notably Ariel. When she sees other people for the first time, she is understandably overcome with excitement, and utters, among other praise, the famous line above. However, what she is actually observing is not men acting in a refined or civilized manner, but rather representatives of the worst of humanity, who betrayed or tried to betray their brothers or leaders to get ahead. Huxley employs the same irony when the ""savage"" John refers to what he sees as a ""brave new world""

true,Soul_Doubt,Scotland,'06 ER6N,"I suggest doing your CBT, buying a 125cc and riding that on L plates for at least 6 months to a year until you get the hang of it and are very confident in your ability.

Then do the DAS (Full A entitlement, as you are over 24 the A1 and A2 are not worth your time they are just there to help younger riders get a bigger bike as they can't do the full test).  The experience on the smaller bike will really help you and make you a better/safer rider long term.

On a smaller bike you have to take everything out of each gear which I find helps you learn how to use gears properly.  It also will allow you to make mistakes that a larger bike would not forgive.. i.e. a blip of the throttle at the wrong time on a smaller bike may result in a minor lose of traction where as on a 600cc+ it may put you on the ground.

Also I'd advise against the 50cc route just because they are slow as hell.. unless you are doing a lot of city traffic I don't think it's worth it and even then I would think twice.

So the long and short of it is, start with the CBT and take it from there.

Hope that helps.

The city centre is lots of fun. The tram gives you great transport links. There's a fantastic independent cinema that's big enough to have a solid mix of big films and small films. If you like video games then there is a yearly event called GameCity which celebrates the culture of video games. It's the best games event I've ever been to in the UK. There are also monthly GameCity nights that have interesting talks and games to play. All the usual restaurants or cafes, I can't recall anything particularly special. I didn't try many of the bars.

If you want to go hiking and you're going to be based in Newcastle you've got good walking in either the Yorkshire Dales (catch the train to Leeds and then connect to local trains or buses) or the Lake District (which might be a bit trickier to get to with public transport). Malham Cove which another commenter recommended is in the Yorkshire Dales. 

Around Newcastle you'd probably like Durham, Dunstanburgh castle and Lindisfarne (Holy Island) for history and gorgeous surroundings. I wouldn't want to miss Lindisfarne actually.

If you're not likely to come back to the UK for a while and want to pack lots in it's worth bearing in mind that the budget airlines offer flights from Newcastle to Dublin, Belfast and Exeter that are really cheap (like £40-60ish). So you could get over to Northern Ireland and Ireland easily and also get down to Devon without enduring an expensive full day of train travel. To check dates/fares use http://www.skyscanner.net, set the departure airport as Newcastle, destination as 'everywhere' and when you select dates you can set it to check a whole month to find the lowest priced options.

If you have any pictures of that night that are gruesome injury photos, add those.

Here are a couple places where I'd put those flyers:

1. Next to the entrances of the huge residential complexes on the south portion of Essex road.

1. At all bus shelters on Essex Road And on upper street

2. At Pubs and Bars (Essex road and Upper street). If you have lots of time, I would hit up every restaurant on upper street.

3. Essex Rail Station, Angel Tube Station

3. I would also place a notice at the Sainsbury's, Waitrose, and M&amp;S in Angel (They're all next to each other). Lots of locals get their groceries there, if your witnesses are local they will probably see it here.

Don't just place flyers were the accident happened. We're assuming the people that saw the flyer are local, or enjoy spending time in Angel. So place them where locals would eventually see them. Place other flyers in places where people congregate (bars/ restaurants then eventually bus stops).

The ‘forced’ conversion narrative illustrates the power of fantasty in which a vision of a nebulous threat has been established, this story helps Sikhs become Sikhs, it enables them to identify themselves and is thus used to negotiate the various anomalies experienced in the somewhat unsettled diasporic condition. These ‘forced’ conversion narratives seem to echo the ‘white slavery’ scares and the role they played in articulating and representing Anti-Semitism. The focus in the ‘forced’ conversion narratives on the ‘predatory’ Muslim males allows these stories to be inserted as a Sikh chapter in the development of current Islamophobia.

Fundamentally it cannot be if Independence is being sold, yet more policy powers will be required from the member applicant state to remain/admit as a member of the EU...

&gt; We're in the EU. By remaining so, we're not giving them any more powers than they currently have. We are simply removing a layer of bureaucracy and having a direct link to the EU ourselves.

This is not factual assertion. By saying this you believe Scotland will accede via Article 48 TEU Lisbon Treaty. My belief at the present time is that it will have to be via Article 49 TEU Lisbon Treaty.

The implications of the history of the EU and of the above formal processes will lead to additional stipulations of membership during neogitations and setting up for future Treaties.

This is 100% consistent with the last 40+ years of the EU.

&gt;No one is offering this.

And more importantly why? I would suggest that the political momentum of Independence by Salmond has created it's own rationale independent of the optimal outcome.

And this is the fundamental flaw attributed to Salmond's method to achieve Independence as evidence by the currency questions eg:

&gt;*Is it an ""exchange of value"" or ""an asset"" Mr. Salmond?*

If you want to get into a longer philosophical debate about how 'freedom of speech' does not imply 'freedom from the consequences of that speech when given in a public setting'. Sure. Obviously assault, battery and the like are illegal. But its not instantly clear either that the state having a prohibition from censoring certain speech acts (so including publications) really boils down to the state or society as a whole having an obligation not to hit someone in the face. Nor that a punch to the face is the same as a direct threat to life and limb which it would appear the state and society do have an obligation to prevent.

Hell its a general problem with liberalism as a school of theories anyway. Central to it is the notion of freedom of speech, derived from earlier ideas of 'republics of letters' - notion being public debate should be driven by open discussions and the truth. 

But is that really the same as positions that are inherently divisive, that might reject political pluralism out of hand. Seems to be something that attacks the core of what liberalism is about anyway (that is allowing societal and political pluralism).

The only reason I can see why there's any value in staying in the UK is that they're financially propping us up. Opportunities are scarce enough in this place without Britain's support. Would I be sad if there less British culture in my immediate vicinity? No. I'm sick of staring at flags. The monarchy is a pile of wank and the increasing popularity of right-wing attitudes in the UK is tiring. 

The South have their fair share of problems too, what with their stupid attitudes to abortion, small-scale corruption and economic stagnation (at least anywhere outside Dublin, which is a great place.) 

Either way, it doesn't really matter to me. I know some people have extremely strident views that NO SURRENDER or *Oh begorrah we should be one country one island just like Fionn mac Cumhaill would have wanted,* but for me the real issues are about getting myself and my loved ones out. 

I don't really care what happens to Northern Ireland; it's a pretty place, for sure, but the weather is crap, opportunities are thin to non existent, and most importantly, the majority of people's attitudes on both tribal 'sides' are reason enough to consign the place to the dustbin. A lot of people here have a really ugly tribalism running through their veins that I cannot and will not relate with. Or tolerate for much longer. Nationalism of any kind is pointless. 

Australia, Canada, the USA, France, Italy, Spain - there all places I'd prefer to live once I've built up a bit of a fund. Sure, they all have their problems, some very similiar to our own (look at the lunacy that is US patriotism,) but the overall benefits outweigh staying in this little puritanical hole.

What powers? 

&gt; This is not factual assertion. By saying this you believe Scotland will accede via Article 48 TEU Lisbon Treaty. My belief at the present time is that it will have to be via Article 49 TEU Lisbon Treaty.

That's a lot of words into my mouth. That's not what I was getting at at all, in the slightest. I was not referring to the process by which Scotland will join as a member state. It is factual to say that Scotland is in the EU. That is a fact. My passport says ""European Union"" on it, all of the Scottish Parliament's laws must be compatible with the EU's laws. We are in the EU. We are not a member state, but we are in it. 

We will not be moving from one political union to another. We are currently in two, and we will be leaving one of them. 

We are in the EU. 

&gt; And more importantly why? I would suggest that the political momentum of Independence by Salmond has created it's own rationale independent of the optimal outcome.

Errrr no. A fine theory, but not based on what's happening on the ground at all. The Scottish Government asked the other parties within the Parliament if they wished a second question, one on Devo-Max, but they said no.

Is it going to be ICT, Aberdeen or Motherwell for example? Do any of the teams below Celtic possess the depth that they do?

And I am not even a Celtic fan!! 

Celtic are able to spend £12 million on a player if they feel the need to. Can any of the other clubs spend that much? 

The gulf in talent, finance and success is so far apart it beggars belief. Put it this way, Rangers (the most successful side in terms of title wins) have won the title 54 times and Celtic have won it 45 times. The third joint placed sides of Hearts, Aberdeen and Hibernian  have won only 4 times in their entire history. There have only been 11 sides to have ever won the league title (a hand full before the SPL set up out of those 11) and the latest to win was by Aberdeen in the 80s (Sir Alex Ferguson period). 

Really though, I have never seen a league so astronomically skewed in favour of a side.

http://www.thesalarycalculator.co.uk/salary.php

Shows that on 25k your income before tax should have been £2,083 per month. I've always found this site to be right to within a couple of quid -- matches up with what you reported.

Every time I've gotten a payrise, the new salary has taken effect at the beginning of a month.

Your payslip should now show a gross pay per month (i.e. before tax) of £3,250. 

Your after tax should be £2,456 (depending on your tax code -- with no other income i think this shuold be 1000L nowadays).

So long as that is right, then tax is complicated. Basically you're always taxed as if you're going to receive that income for the entire year -- when you get a payrise mid financial year, it knocks that into a cocked hat, so yes, there are a couple of months where a ""balancing act"" has to happen to make sure that over the 12 tax months you pay the total tax appropriate.

So long as it returns to £2,456 within a couple of months i wouldn't worry -- just use an income tax calculator at the end of the year with the total amount you've *actually* been paid that year (it'll be on your P60), and compare it to what you've actually paid in tax (also on your P60). If you're worried, compare that to the deductions on your payslip.",0,1409394267,null,0,false,0,ck4j69r,t3_2ezub9,t1_ck4j69r,t3_2ezub9,null,1427285276,38,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,38

Just do the maths! 4.5% compound growth is impossible on a finite planet, it is really rather simple. I have quoted and I will quote again;

&gt; Let us imagine that in 3030BC the total possessions of the people of Egypt filled one cubic metre. Let us propose that these possessions grew by 4.5% a year. How big would that stash have been by the Battle of Actium in 30BC? This is the calculation performed by the investment banker Jeremy Grantham(1).

&gt; Go on, take a guess. Ten times the size of the pyramids? All the sand in the Sahara? The Atlantic ocean? The volume of the planet? A little more? It’s 2.5 billion billion solar systems(2).

&gt; The trajectory of compound growth shows that the scouring of the planet has only just begun. As the volume of the global economy expands, everywhere that contains something concentrated, unusual, precious will be sought out and exploited, its resources extracted and dispersed, the world’s diverse and differentiated marvels reduced to the same grey stubble.

&gt; Some people try to solve the impossible equation with the myth of dematerialisation: the claim that as processes become more efficient and gadgets are miniaturised, we use, in aggregate, fewer materials. There is no sign that this is happening. Iron ore production has risen 180% in ten years(12). The trade body Forest Industries tell us that “global paper consumption is at a record high level and it will continue to grow.”(13) If, in the digital age, we won’t reduce even our consumption of paper, what hope is there for other commodities?

&gt; Look at the lives of the super-rich, who set the pace for global consumption. Are their yachts getting smaller? Their houses? Their artworks? Their purchase of rare woods, rare fish, rare stone? Those with the means buy ever bigger houses to store the growing stash of stuff they will not live long enough to use. By unremarked accretions, ever more of the surface of the planet is used to extract, manufacture and store things we don’t need. Perhaps it’s unsurprising that fantasies about the colonisation of space – which tell us we can export our problems instead of solving them – have resurfaced(14).

&gt; As the philosopher Michael Rowan points out, the inevitabilities of compound growth mean that if last year’s predicted global growth rate for 2014 (3.1%) is sustained, even if we were miraculously to reduce the consumption of raw materials by 90% we delay the inevitable by just 75 years(15). Efficiency solves nothing while growth continues.

I love FSG and Rodgers but one has to wonder why we bought two expensive left sided centre backs when we had one of the most talented ball playing centre backs in the world at the club. 

Granted he's injury prone but Sakho is young and gets injured too so they could have easily shared the spot with all the games this year. 

Instead of this we keep Skrtel as a starter who, while competent and statistically in most areas is one of the weakest team players in the squad. He doesn't lead, he drags the defence back to the six yard box at every opportunity, his concentration lapses are so bad we think he is a gear last ditch defender (with all the practice he gives himself it's no surprise), and he is average at best with the ball.

Both have their flaws but there is no doubt on my eyes that if a veteran left sided CB (instead of kolo) and an excellent young right sided CB (instead of Sakho) had been available or bought our defence would be a lot stronger.

Most players are loyal because the club (we haven't exactly torn it up for recent periods) is successful or because better offers (Barca, Man city) didn't come along, Agger was loyal because he loved the club, the fans and everything that went with it.

Everyone will tell you how vibrant the culture is, and it's really true. You CONSTANTLY meet people from absolutely everywhere, and it really broadens your experiences. There's always tons of random cultural events going on. Nightlife is pretty decent, with some really cool pubs and a couple of big clubs. There's a great live music scene. Some pretty big cultural attractions in and around Leicestershire. And you're not far from Manchester/Liverpool or London if you want to visit somewhere else.

Overall a pretty decent place.

Ultimately it is the responsibility of you as an individual to know what you are being paid and why. If only for the reason that if your employer accidentally overpays you beyond what you've agreed on your contract then they are, within reason, entitled to ask for that money to be returned.

OP - I strongly suggest setting up a comprehensive excel spreadsheet to figure this out for you, or download one. Don't use all these websites people are posting except to get a rough idea. Use the proper formulas for calculating National Insurance, Student loan contributions, Lower rate and Higher rate income tax as well as your personal tax allowance. Since you work in software development I doubt this is beyond your capability, in terms of IT or mathematics. Then each month you can simply plug the details from your payslip in to keep track of what they are giving you vs what you think you should be getting.

Who gives a shit? What did you want, data from today? 3 years ago the world was pretty much the same as it is now. Jesus, the way he goes on there, you'd think it was 50 years old.

&gt;""WHY NOT - Czech Republic? Latvia? Lithuania? Slovakia? They're in the EU AND NORTH OF AUSTRIA! PLUS THE DATA IS GIVEN IN THE REPORT"" - The only reason they're not included is because the author wanted to manipulate it to bits. 

WHY NOT INCLUDE THE WHOLE WORLD!? It was pretty clear which areas the report covered. As has already been mentioned by the post you replied to.

&gt;BTW NOTE it's INNER LONDON NOT LONDON ITSELF SO ONLY ZONE 1-2 (or 3? not sure).

We know what the City of London is. Again, he's gone on an all-caps bender to tell us what was clear from the first report.

&gt;Well because most of us commute. Not just within London but outside of London. This is also the case in many parts of the UK. Many many people from as far as Nottingham commute to London to work. Not everyday, but frequently, for clients, business deals, etc. The figures aren't a very good measure of income nor of any well being! The only thing that this can be used for is comparing economic activity within a region. I.E. How developed that region is.

I don't know about anyone else, but I understand that people commute. I could work in The City from my home on Tyneside if I wanted to. What is he disproving here?

&gt;Surprise, surprise! Most of these ""northern"" countries were included in the original link. Except Czech Republic. Know why? because ALL of their regions except Praha are 73 or under. Praha is 171, which basically means almost all are Czechs commute for their work.

So the Czechs aren't in the report. The report isn't the full world, it isn't all of Europe. You might as well ask why Peru isn't on there.",0,1409406067,null,0,false,0,ck4lo2g,t3_2ewxdx,t1_ck4lo2g,t1_ck3tuz7,null,1427284112,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Cleverly to Villa is pretty much on, he wasn't in the match day squad against Burnley and that's usually a good sign.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"Depends a lot on the field. I had a pay rise from £33 to £45K this year which is fairly typical in my field, for people to get fairly large pay rises in their early years as they rapidly gain experience (and thus increase in value). However over time this value-added approach levels out as their experience levels out.  

In other professions people start at a fairly high salary and then move up in very small increments.... or alternatively there are unfortunately just some jobs where people start very low and their pay rises are also very low. 

It's a shame people don't tend to consider these things when they choose careers or apply for jobs. Two examples that spring to mind are office administrators and a fast food chain staff... 

* The fast food chain employee starts as a dogsbody and only earns minimum wage. However, with the right attitude within as little as 10 years in a job like that (which tend to have fast employee turnovers) it's possible to have moved through the ranks of team leader/shift leader to general manager and be on a respectable £35k.

* On the flip side, you might choose to work in an offices admin department at a starting salary of £16k... sounds respectable for a college leaver. But what you don't realize at the time is that those kind of jobs tend to have a glass ceiling of about £18k so the room for pay progression is incredibly limited. Usually it's because ""admin"" are considered the bottom rung of the office hierarchy, so their pay is effectively capped by the pay of other departments like sales/marketing who have to be paid more to reflect the hierarchy. 

Another example would be someone in the Army. A newly qualified 2nd Lieutenant fresh out of Sandhurst might be well trained BUT they are inexperienced and their value to the army is limited. In some senses, having them around is little more than a burden. On the flip side, the Captain with 3-4 years experience in the army who has probably done at least 1 or 2 tours is very productive/useful... and that is reflected in their pay. A newly qualified 2nd Lieutenant only earns about £25k. By contrast a captain earns about £40k, even though in practice they may only have been in the army 3-4 years longer.",0,1409406338,null,0,1409406885,0,ck4lr8f,t3_2ezub9,t1_ck4lr8f,t1_ck4jqfd,null,1427284071,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

A loan would be nice as it provides insurance if one of our strikes goes down to injury. He can also provide some depth we lack on the left. We may also need a striker if Togo qualifies for the Africa Cup of Nations from mid-January to early-February.

If the price is right (£11 million-ish), I wouldn't mind a permanent move. However, if the asking price is too high, I'd rather allocate that money into fortifying our wings or attacking mids, especially if Holtby to Hamburger is going to happen.

It's not exceptionally rare. Since an `A*` in Mathematics is required for Computer Science, I can't imagine that it's a big advantage when it comes to applying since *everyone* will have `A*` in Mathematics (whether it's at the end of year 12/13) but a high UMS can only help show that your capable I suppose. I personally think that the route you are taking is the better route for yourself since you will not have to worry about fulfilling the `A*` requirement during year 13 exam time (since you would have already bagged it last year) and you won't have to begin learning the more difficult calculus in a single year (it'll be spread out over two years with C3,C4 in year 12 and FP2/FP3 in year 13).

I'm just going to begin the first year as a Computer Science student in October, which is why all the application nonsense is still stuck in my head - I've just gone through it all. In fact, considering I have to choose my NatSci module once I arrive, I'm still going through it. Physics is said to be a significant step up from A-level and one of the most conceptually challenging courses, which is why I hesitate to select it. I have no particular interest in any of the choices, if I'm honest.

I have to ask why you've begun to think about applying to Cambridge at such an early stage.

The basic rate band is where the first £31,865 of your earnings are taxed at 20%, which equates to £6,373.

The next band is the higher rate, which is where earnings between £31,865 up to £150,000 is taxed at 40%. So far, we've received £10,000 tax-free and the first £31,865 has been taxed at the basic rate. This leaves £18,135 of your earnings to be taxed at 40%. This equates to £7,254.

Their scorer will be Sturridge is he plays. 


I would be okay with a draw seeing Liverpool might find their way. We should be getting the win, as I stated above, but a draw wouldn't upset me. But I wouldn't be happy what-so-ever either. I'd be content.

ETA description backed by links to published studies

*""Niacinamide has been extensively studied and proven to increase the rate of collagen synthesis, lighten and even skin tone, reduce and eliminate acne as well as improve the skin's own production of Hyaluronic acid. Niacinamide also reduces sebum production thereby reducing the appearance of pore size [effective at 2% in clinical trials].*

*Niacimamide aids in the increase of ceramide production in the skin and improves skin barrier function. Trans epidermal water loss is reduced. Vitamin B3 has also been shown to increase the production of NADPH in older skin to that of levels as once produced in youth.*

*DNA is the rare biomolecule that is not discarded when it is damaged, but rather is repaired. Human cells have developed two fundamental repair strategies to restore DNA to its native sequence and conformation.*

*More than 20 different proteins participate in this multistep process, and many of these proteins also participate in RNA transcription and/or DNA synthesis.  The process of DNA repaid relies on the presence of Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) which is rapidly depleted during the repair process. Niacinamide is member of the the vitamin B family and is crucial that it is in reserve for dermal cells to replenish NAD.*

*Niacinamide is a multi functional and clinically effective active with multiple studies on various aspects of effects on the improved health of the skin. In combination with N-acetyl D glucosamine, the synergy is magnified several fold. ""*

* Very interested to see how we handle Lukaku today. It's fairly obvious that he will get the start and will want to make an impression. I think we will shut him down, but I wouldn't be surprised if he grabbed one against the run of play.
* Hazard, Schurrle and their respective fullbacks will be crucial in this game. The extent to which they are able to exploit Baines and Coleman will likely determine how effective we are in this game.
* Really looking for Fabregas to spread the play today. Everton looks least comfortable when they get spread out on the counter.
* Very interested to see Drogba's fitness if he is chosen. So much has been said about his inability to play a full 90 minutes, but this game will really show exactly what kind of stamina he still has. He could very well grab a couple off of crosses if we play effectively out wide.
* Hopefully Ivanovic keeps up his blistering form, especially in defense. I don't like match-ups for him in this match.
* A win here would be a perfect statement game for us at this early stage in the campaign.

2-1 Chels.

&gt;

&gt;__Tongue-in-cheek__ is a [figure of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_of_speech) used to imply that a statement or other production is humorously or otherwise not seriously intended, and it should not be taken at face value. The facial expression typically indicates that one is joking or making a mental effort.  In the past, it may also have indicated contempt, but that is no longer common. 

&gt;By 1842, the phrase had acquired its contemporary meaning, indicating that a statement was not meant to be taken seriously.    Early users of the phrase include [Sir Walter Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Walter_Scott) in his 1828 *[The Fair Maid of Perth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fair_Maid_of_Perth)*.

I'm not talking about what you are thinking. I'm trying to criticise a misleading ""briefing"" that was linked in the subreddit.

They've basically picked and chose the countries to make the UK and London look bad as possible.

Secondly, what do you mean I think ""it's okay because I say it's not about wealth and that it's about development?"" That I think the underdevelopment in Cornwall is okay? Where the hell did I say that? All I did was criticise the blatant bias of the ""briefing"" and also how stupid it was to use GDP per Capita per region to measure inequality, wealth and how 'rich' a region is compared to another.

Jovetic was too quiet, I don't think both Aguero and Jovetic should play at the same time, too much dropping back and playing it in midfield, nobody in the box.

Navas was decent when he came on, made some nice passes (that back heel was lovely).

Fernando was pretty solid before his injury, I hope he's alright because when Fernandinho came on, he was poor. When Kompany pushes forwards Fernando drops back, but when Fernandinho is on the pitch his instinct is to go forwards, I can see Fernando being used again tougher opponents this year.

Dzeko was alright, got a couple of decent headers, we finally had a player who could benefit from crosses.

If Zaba is fit, play him. Sagna was ok, but kept floating in crosses to Aguero and Silva, two of our smallest players. I don't think he had as much of an attacking role at Arsenal, so maybe he has to adapt.

Disappointing result, but we can't win them all. I hope Pellegrini kicks them up the arse in the dressing room and get's them fired up, we need to play better in our next tough run of games for sure.

Why not include the world? Have you read the title of the previous post? It says - ""The UK is the most financially unequal country in Northern Europe with 9 of the top 10 poorest regions... but it's also home to the richest - London""

NOTE THE ""Northern Europe"" part. If it said the world then it would be even more ridiculous don't you think so?

And why shouldn't Latvia, Czech Rep, Lithuania, Latvia and Norway be included? They're more 'North' than freaking Germany, France and Austria. 

If they had called the title instead of Northern Europe; within 10 EU countries - Germany, France, Ireland, etc, then I would have had less of a problem.


Also the Inner London bit wasn't so clear. The post before clearly states London and not Inner London, also in the bloody picture of the ""briefing"" it states ""This is because the UK is much more unequal than other countries, where there is nowhere as rich as London, but nowhere as poor as our poorest regions."" Which is clearly false and again it doesn't specify that it's Inner London. Even though in the list it puts Inner London and below it says Inner London is the richest region in the EU, many will take this as the whole of London. 


What am I disproving here? That the data can be very dependent on commuters. Have you read the Eurostat website I've linked or quoted? They clearly say that their data is affected greatly by commuters.

This is why I repeat time and time again that the data cannot be used to measure Inequality, wealth and 'richness' so purposefully.

It's obviously not great when you don't score but when a team defends as deep and as well as Stoke does it's very difficult. You can sometimes expect a few lucky ricochets to give you a chance but we didn't get that today. I don't think failing to score is a massive issue.

The defending on the other hand was criminal. I don't think I've seen a team dominate us in the air like Stoke managed to today. Demichelis and Kolarov had very poor defensive displays. Toure and the two Fernas lost the ball in bad positions way too frequently and Hart did a very poor job when it came to the goal. I always say when a team is content with parking the bus, *never* give them something to hang on to. I think if Stoke hadn't have scored we would have had more chances than we did.

true,Antsonfire,num18,,"Thanks for putting this up. 

I've said before here that we need another attacking mid, but not neccesarily one that'll start. Holtby filling in on the middle makes sense, considering it's a fluid front three, and the sheer number assists from Eriksen and him to Lamela and Ade/Soldado would be ridiculous. 

We did see what he can do at center mid, and it was impressive in the athletic sense. He ran fucking everywhere, filling in gaps and all that. Only problem with that is that it's not done in a measured tempo. He doesn't have the composure of Bentaleb or Schneiderlin there.

There was a horrendous tackle attempt in preseason, and I'm pretty sure he could've ended the guy's regular season if Holtby was on target. So that kind of rules out his defensive duties. 

I really put a lot more faith in Holtby over Paulinho, particularly because I don't think that Paulinho can rotate as effectively with the front three like Holtby can, and Pauli's not a creator that Holtby was in the Bundesliga or Eriksen in the Eredivisie. Yes, he bags in goals, but why not just put Kane in the hole if Holtby or Eriksen is injured? Then there's an obvious quality gap between the Brasileirao (World Football Phone In's Tim Vickery basically sums up a Rio or Paulista club's thinking: long-term is twelve hours, a little less than that is six, and short term is pay me now. All the clubs are in massive debt and the technical talent that Brazil is famous for producing is a dying phenomenon. The situation is dire over there.) 

If nothing else, he at least deserves a chance. Holtby loves the club in a way I think only Sandro does, and it'd be a shame to lose him just for the personality side of things. He shouldn't go. He loves us and we love him. Hamburg would be a massive step down for the guy, who was playing in the CL with the 3rd or fourth best team in Germany, now moved down to a side fighting for midtable.

However, I am a (soon to be former!) property insurance underwriter (dealing with people like your landlord, via insurance brokers).

I have also had to address my own issues as a long term tenant under an AST with a private landlord.

If you have been asked to pay anything as a deposit, as defined in the tenancy, then it should be protected. Simple.

Referencing, etc fees do not count as part of the deposit.

Check you tenancy agreement, it should state something along the lines of 'The tenant(s) will pay £xxxx to the landlord on commencement of this tenancy which will placed in a deposit scheme' - that is the new version, previously it just stated that the landlord would hold the deposit in a bank account whereby interest would not be owed to the tenant.

Seriously - if you have concerns, go the CAB, if you need to move due to the landlord being dodgy its better you know what you are/are not allowed to do beforehand, as it will allow you to raise a case with your local authorities housing dept in the first instance, or take out a County Court hearing against the agency or landlord (as applicable).

I'm not a solicitor, and please don't take this as legal advice, its just based on personal experience - any legal advice should come from a registered agency (CAB, Shelter, Etc) for it to carry any weight.

Murphy makes a very convincing case here. I still feel he's pleased that he's able to make a song and dance of it all but I'm far more worried about the widespread acceptance of the intimidation tactics.

Murphy's message seems to be the usual Better Together cheap shots at Salmond and tactical scaremongering - but the important thing is it's not up to me to judge if his content is worthwhile.

We had a long discussion here that ended fairly fruitlessly. The crux of it is that I don't like counter-protests and feel it's incredibly anti-democratic to organise people to turn up to heckle/abuse/intimidate/block/etc. The yes supporters are turning up to prevent Jim Murphy trying to get his message across. That's utterly wrong and indefensible. I'm pretty much alone with that sentiment and I don't know why.

Down in England we had George Galloway, a hateful racist bigot attacked in the street. It is fair to say I'm no fan of that pompous demagogue but I'm just as concerned that people think it's ok to silence politicians. It turns out his injuries are less serious than expected but that isn't the point.

The thing I'm least concerned out of all of this is eggs. An egg gets thrown, it's a bit messy. The police usually lift whoever threw it and that's it. The important thing though is that throwing eggs doesn't prevent someone speaking - of course that's different if you organise 40 people to turn up and constantly throw eggs to stop someone.

Mirallas and Howard both lucky to stay on the pitch. Howard handball stopped Hazard scoring. Mirallas stomped on Fabregas' hand after fouling him. 

Brilliant header from Lukaku, rightly offside for Distin. 

Brilliant ball from Fabregas to put Costa through. 

I won't say ivanovic was lucky to not be given offside because that's impossible to call with everyone coming out as he goes in. Great finish. 

Good header from Mirallas, no chance for Courtois.

To show you what I mean, here's J-Rod's [heat map](http://i.imgur.com/imJTn0O.png) against Fulham last season. Now [here's](http://i.imgur.com/si6BZ9O.jpg) Lamela's. The major similarity is that J-Rod tends to get deeper into the box, but I think it's a matter of time and confidence before Lamela can start getting into the same positions. For the most part though, they were cutting in and maybe even switching flanks for the full 90. 

Just because Eriksen would be moved out left doesn't imply that he'll hug the touchlines like Townsend or Lennon would normally do. Lamela and Eriksen are already stepping on each other's toes as it is. 

EDIT: Shit, I should've read clearly. You didn't mention J-Rod at all! My point still stands though that since Lamela and Eriksen are fundamentally central players, there's no real conflict of interest if Holtby gets slotted into the middle.

true,modernafrican,null,null,"To be honest I have never understood the devotion to Holtby as he has never performed outstandingly on a consistent basis to warrant it. In regards to him staying or going I am not terribly bothered either way due for couple of reasons.

1. Eriksen starts there and he is a better AMC than Holtby. In a disappointing season last season he was often the one bright spot .

2. Mauricio Pochettino's system for attacking players is about movement and flexibility. If you watched Southampton last season or spurs against QPR, the front 4 (striker, AM, LM &amp; RM) swap, drop, drift, etc. It is not the same role he played for Shalke.

3. Chadli, Kane and Lamela can play through the middle behind the the striker, which is the position you are advocating for holtby.
If a player does not fit the system being played and coached by the manager and cannot adapt to it, do you change the system to fit the player in, or let him move on? It may be a bit harsh but that is how I think of it, Holtby's mediocre performances outside his preferred position show me that maybe he should move on. Don't get me wrong I like him but I see him as second choice behind Eriksen and Pochettino has shown with his substitutions and squad selections so far that he thinks Kane plays well in that no10 position behind the striker. 

I don't think it would be a disaster if he moved on

Now, from the Articles when he was at Schalke. 

&gt;He can also switch positions with the other midfielders, so we’re not caught off-guard without the ball. 

&gt;However, he can also be relied upon to drop in and rotate with the other midfielders, so we are not caught off balance if we loose the ball.

I think that answers your second point. There's plenty more out there to back that up, but he's a VERY versatile AMC that can do everything you said he couldn't in your original point. Your third point..

&gt;Chadli, Kane and Lamela can play through the middle behind the the striker, which is the position you are advocating for holtby.

&gt;he thinks Kane plays well in that no10 position behind the striker.

Lamela is likely to play as much as Eriksen, and will be burnt out. Holtby is literally twice as talented as both Chadli and Kane at AMC. It's not even close. Just look at the quotes from the articles, and the stats that he was picking up. 80% completion playing vertical passes? The assists? The fact he easily could have doubled that if Huntelaar could finish (check out the Scout report video on Holtby - you'll see him put so many players through, mainly The Hunter, and he'll fluff it. 

&gt;If a player does not fit the system being played and coached by the manager and cannot adapt to it, do you change the system to fit the player in, or let him move on? It may be a bit harsh but that is how I think of it, Holtby's mediocre performances outside his preferred position show me that maybe he should move on.

Play Eriksen at AML. Holtby at AMC. We played so narrow in our attacking midfield that if you look at the average positions, our AML on the day, Chadli - was ONTOP of Eriksen and Lamela in central positions. Eriksen can actually cross, unlike Townsend and Lamela, and he will also find plenty periods where he's in a central position as the average player position's showed. 

What do you think?

EDIT : Your first point.

&gt;Eriksen starts there and he is a better AMC than Holtby. In a disappointing season last season he was often the one bright spot .

Is he? Have you seen Holtby consistantly at AMC for us, and Holtby at Schalke compared to Eriksen in the Eredivisie? ",0,1409420566,null,0,1409421214,0,ck4rdn9,t3_2f0ir4,t1_ck4rdn9,t1_ck4r6rc,null,1427281426,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

How much discussion about ""Well I see what they're saying but I don't think it's worth it"" or ""To be honest it doesn't even matter if I lose a bit of money it's worth it in the long run"" or any other discussion at all that people weren't having before.

The question that we won't know until later is if the damage done by 1) has been offset by the positive results of 2)

Ozil is a player that very vocally favours the nr.10 role and is one of the best in the world at it yet Wenger has him on the left wing to try and fit his best players into the system, I really haven't been a fan of Ozil's play this season on that wing I think he should be in the nr.10 role and the team should be moulded around him.

I feel the same way about Eriksen, he's our AMC that's his favoured position and a player of his talent should always be played in his strongest position the rest of the team should be moulded around accommodating that.

When it came to our letting agent contract it said ""no animals"", we protested and they said they knew the landlady said that it was fine but it was their policy to have it in the contract. We were fuming. There were a whole bunch of things wrong with that contract (compared to what had been advertised and what we had been told). It was also supposed to be sent to us a week before signing (so we could check it) but they had 'difficulty sending it' then 'difficulty emailing it' but assured us it was all fine. So when it came to the day of signing and lots of it was wrong there was nothing we could do! We'd gave up rent on our place and had to sign and move and they knew it. They were also sending a gardener to our property (never sent but still charged our landlady, she was fuming)... God we have an arm length list of things that went badly with them. To the point that our landlady has finished contract with them and is contracting us herself. From what I last heard I'm sure she was taking them legally for fees they'd charged her for which they shouldn't have.

Basically what I'm saying is Eriksen will not be isolated as a AML. He will find as much space moving into the AMC position, if not more with his off the ball movement.

Or surely even if they didn't prosecute, one of them should have suggested she go to the hospital to get checked over for vaginal trauma or AIDs or something. Passed-out rapist guy doesn't exactly seem the most considerate sexual partner.


I think that's generally what official rape hotlines advise - first hospital for a rape kit, then police.

That doesn't mean the supposed victim shouldn't be treated humanely in all instances throughout the process. 

But it does mean we should always seek proof and certainty rather than locking up anyone who is even accused of sexual crimes (or any crime for that matter). 

Unfortunately that means that when a girl is drunk it adds an extra problem and issue in successfully proving and convicting the alleged rapist. This means that some may get away with it - but the flip side of that two edged sword would be locking up innocent people simply because of an accusation. 

Without emotion - that's something we can't afford - not because we don't care about rape victims but because we *must* have proof before conviction.

true,grogipher,eu,Bu Chòir!,"&gt; As an Englishman, I would respect the ""yes"" vote far more if independence actually means independent. Being independent but being dependent on currency isn't actually independent at all is it?

You've missed the point of self determination. 

If we vote yes we will have governments and parliaments that have all the powers of an independent nation. Governments that reflect our political desires *and* have the tools to implement them. We could elect a government hell bent on keeping the pound, we could elect a government that wants to set up a new currency, we could elect a government that wants to use the euro, or the yen, or whatever. That's the bottom line, and that's what independence means. 

Independence doesn't mean whatever the SNP or Alex Salmond want. It means moving powers from London to Edinburgh and **then** we can have the grown up discussions about what to do with those powers. Do we want Trident? Probably naw. Do we want to stay in the EU? Probably ayes. Our decisions, our rights, our responsibilities. 

As for 'cutting ties with the UK', I've never met anyone who would want such a thing. Just because we don't want to share a Parliament does not mean we want to cast ourselves adrift. I am sure we can continue to work together in our mutual best interests through the British-Irish Council, the EU, NATO, the UN, whatever..",0,1409421371,null,0,false,0,ck4rpvw,t3_2ewosy,t1_ck4rpvw,t1_ck3nc4a,null,1427281260,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Second half was nearly all them. Attack after attack. We gave them too much time and space, which seems to be a problem of ours with whoever we face. Boden somehow caught a ball destined to trickle out for a goalkick and scored from a tight angle. 

Halifax are a physical side and pretty dirty but it was dealt with well. We brought on Sinclair and Harrison but the game didn't change much. They had pace and strength at the back to deal with Harrison. Sinclair is amazing, though. He worked a half chance for us, crossed it in and Harrison headed but their keeper could only push it to Harrison and it bounced off him into the net. 

So there was only 30 seconds of normal time left and 4 minutes of added. They were filthy. Should have had a sending off, McManus pushed and went in stronger than he needed too in quick succession. We saw it out and it was a glorious feeling.

Things look to be on the up. 7 points in the last 3 games is great.",0,1409421680,null,0,false,0,ck4rutw,t3_2f0qqf,t1_ck4rutw,t3_2f0qqf,null,1427281196,5,false,conferencefootball,t5_2xoai,5

And yes I'm being nitpicky about the whole Northern European country and Inner London thing, but that's because people will inherently take on a distorted view just because of it. Some people will now actually believe that the UK has 9 out of 10 poorest regions in Northern Europe, which isn't the case at all.

Also I completely agree that London is over developed than other parts of the UK, but that's not what this thread is about. It's about the misuse of data and the sensaltionalist reports that are being done with it. I'll repeat again, it's about the inappropriate usage of data to adhere to an agenda, not about trying to leg up London or the UK.

&gt;There are a number of __alternative names__ used for ___[Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland)___.  Northern Ireland consists of six [historic counties of Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_Ireland), and remains part of the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) following the [secession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secession) of the other twenty-six counties to form the [Irish Free State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Free_State) in 1922 (now the ""[Republic of Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland)"", officially named ""Ireland""). In addition to, and sometimes instead of, its official name, several other names are used for the region. Significant differences in political views between [unionists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unionism_in_Ireland), [nationalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_nationalism) and [republicans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_republicanism) are reflected in the variations of names they use for the region. A proposal to change Northern Ireland's name was seriously considered by the UK and Northern Ireland Governments in 1949 but in the end the name ""Northern Ireland"" was retained.

true,grogipher,eu,Bu Chòir!,"&gt; Can the Scottish govt turn around and say 'these conditions are not acceptable to us, therefore we will not go for independence'?

First of all a few caveats - I don't think this will ever happen. I think a messy negotiations would hurt both nations, and the Edinburgh Agreement and such exists to bring both sides to the table. The person above you says that the UK gets to ""chose who it negotiates"" with, but in realpolitik that's crazy, as it would be the Scottish Government negotiating with the UK Government. Both might want to bring in other parties though, to make it less partisan. 

If agreement can't be reached, there are a few options, they can abandon the timescales and keep trying (most likely). They can have referenda on proposals to gauge public opinion (not so likely). They can bring in outside help through the UN or another independent body to chair the negotiations (the UK probably wouldn't go for this option). 

Alternatively, Scotland could declare itself independent without agreement of the rest of the UK. This is a very awkward position for all to be in, and I don't think any govt would go for it. It would severely damage Scotland's chances of getting into the EU for example, as the UK could refuse to recognise it and thus veto its membership. It would mean that Scotland wouldn't get any of the assets currently outwith its own borders, but then also would mean it wouldn't get any of the debt either. Diplomatic links with other countries would be exceptionally awkward. 

The current Scottish Government is run by the SNP; they're unlikely to say ""no"" to independence, it's kinda their thing! They're not up for re-election until 2016, so if it does take longer than the indicative 18month period, then there *could* potentially be a change of Scottish Government which would obviously change how negotiations work. There's also a possibility of a change of UK Government in 2015 which could alter things too if things have come to an impasse. 

As for Scotland's bargaining chips, I wouldn't completely talk them out. Both sides will have their red lines that they'll refuse to budge over, but there's a fair amount of wiggle room in the middle. The Scottish Govt will be pushing for the smallest debt possible I would imagine, trading in its shares of aircraft carriers or the like. It would probably have a red line on Trident being moved, then there's oil and water and other such things.

* Goal at half time

* That's 5 goals in 10 minutes (5-3)

* World class fucking save by Courtois

* Felipe Luis (last year's best left back) joins Azpilicueta (world class) on the same side of the pitch

* Drogba comes on to make it two African legends on the pitch. Replaced Fabregas playing for Chelsea, obviously the novelty of this circumstance hasn't worn off for me yet.

""Only be sure that you do not eat the blood, for the blood is the life, and you shall not eat the life with the flesh.""

""For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay on you no greater burden than these requirements: that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well.""

The main verse is this:

**For the life of every creature is its blood: its blood is its life. Therefore I have said to the people of Israel, You shall not eat the blood of any creature, for the life of every creature is its blood. Whoever eats it shall be cut off.**

- Hazard was defensively solid and boring for most of the game, and then one moment of sheer brilliance. 

- Ivanovic. What amazing form he's in. Great defensively, and great positioning when in counter attack.

- Not only does Costa score goals, also manages to rile up opponent players. Good movement throughout the match

- Can't blame Courtois for the goals, great save against Mirallas at 2-3

- I'm starting to worry about the Terry-Cahill partnership. Not sure why Naismith's runs behind the defense weren't properly tracked. Look vulnerable when Matic isn't present to cover them.

- Ramires, Willian and Matic were very good

true,BestFriendWatermelon,null,null,"When I read these articles, I find myself conflicted. I was falsely accused of rape (even typing that fills me with irritation at comparing myself to the kind of reprehensible, abusive chancers you'd expect to claim to have been ""falsely accused"" after someone they coerced and cajoled into a compromised position subsequently makes an accusation) by a woman desperate to hide her fully consensual infidelity from her boyfriend. 

I was shocked by the fact that I was arrested and dragged through the system, humiliated and left to face the judgement of all my family and friends, work colleagues, etc, over the questionable word of a woman clearly grasping desperately for an explanation for why she'd come home to her partner at 5am covered in obvious signs of sexual activity.

I wondered how the police officers must have felt, proceeding with an arrest they surely knew in their minds was spurious. I'd gone into shock, shaking and crying uncontrollably, and as they led me out my housemates were frantically trying to tell them they'd been awake in the next room at the time and what they heard wasn't rape. Even her friends witnessed us flirting and kissing each other, there was even a used vibrator that'd been cast aside during the throws of passion that I hadn't put away beside me while they were putting cuffs on me.

Obvious questions such as what was she doing back at a stranger's house hours after she was supposed to go home to her boyfriend who was waiting for her, having ignored his calls and texts all night.

But despite all of this, I agree with the way the police dealt with it, treating the report as serious regardless of their personal instincts. The only fault I can find in what they did is that as far as I can see, they didn't investigate her for perjury.

But my experience was this.

She made the report within 1 hour of having left me. I was arrested within another hour. Although her claim was that I had used force, rather than alcohol on her, they took samples and blood tests from me, and presumably her, to establish how much each of us had had to drink.

The rate at which alcohol breaks down in the human body is well enough understood to be able to calculate how drunk someone was hours earlier. Furthermore there were witnesses to how drunk the girl in the article was, from which they could clearly deduce that the woman in this article was raped. The police should have pursued this.

There is one thing I would take issue with, though. The author complains that the police insisted on talking to her alone despite her wanting her friend there for moral support. In my situation, I don't know how the police proceeded while interviewing my accuser. But I would have hoped they would have spoken to her alone, without her boyfriend there to support her, so that she could speak freely when asked by police ""Are you aware that as a result of your report we will be making an arrest, depriving someone of their liberty, a very serious situation if it turns out that for any reason it was unwarranted?"" or words to that effect, to give her the opportunity to take back the report before it landed me in a police cell, and her in a position where she couldn't confess to lying without risking being charged with perjury herself.

true,modernafrican,null,null,"I watched Holtby at Schalke and I really liked him, when we bought him. I thought at the time, he was exactly what we needed. Connective tissue, another attacking pivot (a new Modric) so that we didn't rely so much on Bale, i thought he was very similar to Kagawa at Dortmund who linked the play between midfeild and attack and gave those killer passes to put Goetze and Lewandoski through. 

He has never fullfilled that potential. Furthermore we bought Eriksen who plays that exact same position and his first season was very productive and versatile, being played through the middle and off the left by Sherwood and now in an ever changing adaptable front 4 by Pochettino

&gt; Holtby is literally twice as talented as both Chadli and Kane at AMC. It's not even close.

That is entirely subjective (my view of Eriksen being better included), even with the stats. I do not deny Holtby is talented but to say 'twice as talented as Chadli and Kane' is a bit of a stretch. They are both quality players and anyone twice as talented would have distinguished themselves. 

&gt; Play Eriksen at AML. Holtby at AMC. We played so narrow in our attacking midfield that if you look at the average positions, our AML on the day, Chadli - was ONTOP of Eriksen and Lamela in central positions. Eriksen can actually cross, unlike Townsend and Lamela, and he will also find plenty periods where he's in a central position as the average player position's showed. 

* [This is Eriksen's overview from the QPR game](http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszone/8-2014/matches/755322/player-stats/80607/OVERALL_02#tabs-wrapper-anchor)

Other than Chadli who stuck to the flanks, they were all over the the middle and final thirds of the pitch, which means,

1.  We weren't narrow at all 
1. The ability to drop deep (to positions that would generally be regarded as CM rather than AMC) and win the ball or start a move is crucial, that for me is Holtby's weakness and something that Eriksen has shown he can do. 

&gt; Is he? Have you seen Holtby consistantly at AMC for us

I haven't. In my view Eriksen does the job fantasticly. Secondly 3 managers (whatever your thoughts of them) have seen Eriksen as the starting AMC not Holtby which probably means that difference shows through in training.

&gt; and Holtby at Schalke compared to Eriksen in the Eredivisie?

To be brutally honest I don't care that much, i do care how they play for spurs and Eriksen was our player of the season last season and it looks like that form may continue. However i watched Holtby at Schalke as i said, unfortunately i don't watch much Eridivisie and I only really get watch Ajax in Europe. It is also worth noting that Eriksen has been very highly rated for a long time and has stated previously that he had offers from big clubs like Man city, Chelsea etc. He didn't take them because he didnt think he was at the right stage of his career, I would say he was at least as highly rated as Holtby was at Schalke probably more so.

I f he moves on i don't mind. I think Holtby, Dembele and Paulinho are players who all play in that middle area and have never really reached their potential, and I like them all a lot as players. Holtby moving on will not be a disaster, and if he hasnt put his hand up and and shown he deserves a run in the first team (which AVB gave him btw) then i have no reason to believe he shall do so.

He is great for depth and is a talented player and in that sense i hope he stays. ",0,1409424658,null,0,false,0,ck4t5v1,t3_2f0ir4,t1_ck4t5v1,t1_ck4rdn9,null,1427280520,8,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,8

true,kierdoyle,null,null,"My thoughts on the match:
Courtois very very good again, but his distribution was very poor. Made the phenomenal stop off Mirallas, but doesn't need to make the save if he sorts out his ball out. So useful on corners, just a beast in the air.

Ivanovic was quite good, especially with Baines and Mirallas being very tricky. 

JT and Gaz were solid, but a few issues. On the first Everton goal, Rambo loses his runner from midfield, but neither recognizes and steps to win the header or pick him up. Seemed a little frantic on the ball in our end too, maybe comes with the higher press from Everton but has to be better, early days.

Dave worked really hard, but that's about it. He got burned time after time by Coleman and McGeady (Yes I know Hazard didn't help much, but still). Today showcased my main issue with a right footed player at left back. Once in the second half him in Cesc were in the corner, and he got it on his left foot (our defensive third) and he refused to smash it up the line with his left foot, tried to force a right footed pass inside and lost it. Seemed to struggle today, guess in 2 years he's allowed make a few mistakes.

Matic and Rambo as a pairing was much better than I expected. Ramires was a lot more responsible than usual, and his energy going forward really caused problems. Phenomenal finish too. Matic the usual powerhouse he is, dictates play so well, cleans up, gets toes in, great stuff. My one criticism is I find he gets caught chasing a lot, Ramires too. The team has to press as a whole to win the ball back, one of them can't just go by themselves or they get passed apart. 

Hazard needs to get more involved. Great dribble for the goal, calms things down when he has to, but NEEDS to get on the ball more and push things. Up the tempo more often. 

Willian looked alright I guess, I saw a comment about Willian once saying Willian has mastered the art of doing nothing but making it look like hard work. 

Cesc: Statisticians are currently extrapolating his assist total at the end of the season to an outstanding ""all of them"". So good on the ball, calm, composed, always looking for the killer pass. Think he needs to be more willing to have a pop though, would just add an extra threat in terms of closing down.

Costa was his usual self today. Puts himself about very well, makes great runs, pisses off everyone who doesn't support Chelsea, scores goals. Both scrubby finishes through Howard's legs, but his movement is incredible. Just peels off and abused the fact that Distin has less than no clue about the offside trap. Should've probably had a hat-trick, but I'll forgive him. 

Overall: Good stuff going forward, phenomenal, very clinical. Look like City last year, so cut throat and incisive. Defensively work to be done. Very good Everton side, would take 3 points any way they came. Should've been easier with Howard probably deserving to go off, and Costa not being offside on the one but not a big deal.

I'd love to keep him and start him at CAM in every cup match, plus fill-in if Eriksen gets injured.

EDIT: I'm also not convinced that he's not in Pochettino's plans.  He played a lot in pre-season and played very well, whereas a bunch of our midfielders did not play in pre-season at all, so Pochettino may have been using these first 2 weeks to make sure he's had a real look at *all* of our players before making final decisions about selling/loaining players.  So Holtby may have been on the bench because Pochettino felt he  already had a good handle on Holtby's quality and needed to use the time to test out some other players.

* The Mirallas goal, if you watch the replay, he jogs back diagonally, leaving acres of space for Mirallas to step in to the whole infront of Cahill and Terry (who were tracking back towards goal to prevent Lukaku from getting a head on the eventually ball). I would say that he could have done more to mark Mirallas.
* On the Naismith goal, he lunges in at McGeady, letting him easily side step, opening up a massive whole to run at the defense. This leads to Ivanovic having to over-compensate by tracking too far inward, leaving Naismith alone at the back post.
* Aside from that, I counted at least three other times where he gave the ball away in the middle of the park, leading to an Everton attack. On top of that, he seems unsure of where/when Fabregas is going to help cover in their defensive third. Granted, part of that may just be a lack of chemistry given it is early in the season.

We weren't narrow at all
The ability to drop deep (to positions that would generally be regarded as CM rather than AMC) and win the ball or start a move is crucial, that for me is Holtby's weakness and something that Eriksen has shown he can do.

I can't find the post - it was only recent too. But I showed (someone will remember) that our front 3 were literally narrow as fuck based on their average positions - almost stepping on eachothers toes, including Chadli. I would much rather have Holtby in that situation in and around the box.  

I've quickly tried to dig up the thread - it's recent, so i'm sure i'll find it. You may have even seen it yourself. 


&gt;The ability to drop deep (to positions that would generally be regarded as CM rather than AMC) and win the ball or start a move is crucial, that for me is Holtby's weakness and something that Eriksen has shown he can do.

For this point I'll refer back to one of the Articles - 

&gt;The most important part of his game is his ability to make vertical, defence-splitting passes. However, he can also be relied upon to **drop in and rotate with the other midfielders, so we are not caught off balance if we loose the ball.**

Seems like it wouldn't be such an issue at all for Lewis. Problem is, he's only ever been played out of position for us and if HAS been AMC, it's here and there. So you can't really judge how well Eriksen can drop deep compared to Holtby when Holtby hasn't even been given a chance whereas Eriksen has. Yet when he was at Schalke, like in the article - it was actaully one of his strengths. One page had the views of multiple Schalke fans - and they feel not only is he creatively gifted, agile as fuck and the whole lot - he's also good enough to drop back and play a Gerrard type role. I can dig that article up too if you want. 

&gt;If he moves on i don't mind. 

That's fine - but then what do we do for depth considering we're playing 50 60 odd games? Regardless of if you think that he's not good enough to ever challenge for the AMC spot contrary to me, we're fucking screwed if that happens. Townsend nor Lennon is good enough. Holtby arguably is the much better player - he hasn't shown it yet, but naturally he is. So what is the point in buying ANOTHER player, and integrating ANOTHER player who may possess zero charisma or energy/workrate when we picked up Holtby up for pennies? It makes no sense. 

If you're basing this JUST from his Spurs performances - then sure, I see your point. But I know what he's capable off personally after watching him at Schalke and used the stats and articles to back that up so people can't claim I was just fanboying him and talking shit cuz ''he has an instagram account'' or whatever. I just feel he's more than good enough to be a fantastic AMC for us at the end of the day. He's proven it in a harder league than Eriksen, a similar league to the EPL too and also he's half English so adapted super easy. It's win/win.

EDIT : I'm also confused, why am I being downvoted in seconds for every detailed post I make on Holtby? Are people really hating on him that much? We've RUINED him. We have.

true,Baggzio,newcr-1,You Signed Lambert We Signed No One At All!!,"I've said it since Leicester, Jags and Distin need sorting and let's be honest Roberto is not going to drop his perfectly fit uninjured captain no matter how bad he is playing. We need Stones in for Distin immediately. I've seen us linked with Alderweireld and lets just throw a blank cheque at Atletico because he's desperately needed. It's not entirely negative though aside from our CBs we're quite a good team. 

I didn't think I'd need to say this, this early into the season but Besic needs to be starting with McCarthy to show Barry he can't play however way he feels like. He's been inconsistent so far good 1st game alright last game a liability this game. Also to those slating Besic it was more Jags ( I think it was that side) not being there to receive the ball off of him. 

Our attacking midfield is superb, I think McGeady despite what people are saying has been fantastic even though he does lose the ball quite a bit, it's because he always takes people on which obviously he'll lose the ball from. Mirallas has been great too, my MOTM today. Seems much more of a team player since last year and much more of a work horse. Naisy, what do I have to say? He's been honestly phenomenal and easily been one of our best players in the last 3 games and will deservedly get our player of the month. As for Rom, you can tell he's trying harder every time and was unlucky not to score today but he does have to push on a bit and open his scoring soon to give him the extra confidence boost. Eto'o when he came on was great for a 40 year old, haha joking he could be a massive player for us this season especially since he'll take the burden off Rom if he's not really scoring.

All and all I think if we can sort out our defence we can be a real force this year. Also just as a kind of I told you so moment, if we don't sort it out and Duffy becomes a really good CB I will be here saying maybe he could've made it here because I believe if Roberto gave him a chance he'd have impressed and especially in the form that our current backs are in.

They were lucky they had Meyer and Draxler coming through, then Advaj (sp) coming in. Their academy is stacked. But check the articles - they were devastated he left, and the general theme from Pundits was ''how will they replace him?''. Not, ''he's medicore - so it's no real loss''. Says a lot, doesn't it? If he's as bad as we all think - why would that be the case? 

&gt;If Holtby were of similar quality to Eriksen there would be a line of clubs all over Europe biting our hands off for his signature right now knowing that he is not one of our starters.

Because we've ruined him. He had the world at his feet - Schalkes tailisman at 21/22, number 10, German u21 captain potentially looking to step up the full NT (unluckily they're STACKED at AMC) to coming to us, where we've ruined him. He's not a CM, and his performances have reflected that and now he just seems like some mediocre player. Why would anyone be interested in that? 

&gt;I guess when we boil it down the crux of your argument is that you think Holtby is comparable in quality to Eriksen which is something I just can't agree with.

It's not. I've stated a few times I don't think Holtby is better than Eriksen. My argument is I would rather have Holtby on the pitch, WITH Eriksen and not Townsend or Lennon. Looking at our opening 2 games, our attacking 3 have played very narrow - and I would have Holtby in 99/100 times over those 2. If that makes sense. However, I do stand by the fact that given a run of games Holtby could produce performances just as good as Eriksen. I truly believe that. If you've basing this off Tottenham Holtby? It's laughable. But Schalke Holtby, in his AMC slot in a 4-2-3-1 which Poch plays? Then yes, for sure. Eriksen played as AML IIRC for Ajax's 4-3-3 system - he's not bad at AML. 

Also, I don't think it's fair to judge the 2. Holtby hasn't had the same run of games in the EPL like Eriksen in his ideal position - so it's unfair to compare I think.

Yup..

&gt;When he has started at CAM, I always thought he looked quite good. He never looked fantastic, but again, he never had a run of games to get into a flow with his teammates. Eriksen didn't look fantastic to start with, either.

Exactly this. He had his moments, like Eriksen. Instantly the goal v Anzhi comes to mind (great control, great finish in the box and great run off the ball) and the assist to Defoe was BEAUTIFUL vs Villa. He also seemed to be forming a nice relationship with Lamela on the field (check Lamela v Villa on Youtube)

&gt; I'm also not convinced that he's not in Pochettino's plans

Which is weird, because Schalke Holtby is literally the perfect AMC for him and the system. Schalke and Spurs now play 4-2-3-1 (not 4-3-3 with 2 CM's like AVB, hence the CM issue).

I watched a ton of Newcastle matches with him last season and I can tell you from first hand experience that Remy is very bad at holdup play, linking up with the midfield and with his back to goal. He uses his strengths, which are his legs (speed) and loves to run in behind and run into space.

true,modernafrican,null,null,"&gt; Problem is, he's only ever been played out of position for us and if HAS been AMC, it's here and there.

For multiple games under Sherwood, Eriksen was played as the left sided midfielder in a 4-4-2 which is definitely not his preferred position. he still managed to be the creative center of the team. To me that is real quality being played out of position and still being able to shine through. 

&gt; he's also good enough to drop back and play a Gerrard type role. I can dig that article up too if you want.

I distinctly remember him being played a CM for spurs on a few occasions and this was not the case. Furthermore you later state ""*and we threw him in at CM and rip the shit out of him.*"" Gerrard is a box to box CM who under Rodgers has morphed into a deep lying play maker.  If he can play the Gerrard role CM should have been a cakewalk. 

&gt;but then what do we do for depth considering we're playing 50 60 odd games?

Thats why I said I hope he stays and provides our depth, but tomorrow afternoon when I see the starting sheet to play liverpool I want to see Eriksen at AMC not Holtby.

&gt; So what is the point in buying ANOTHER player, and integrating ANOTHER player who may possess zero charisma or energy/workrate when we picked up Holtby up for pennies? It makes no sense.  

In modern football it makes complete sense. If a player you currently have is not providing the level or type of performance you want, you sell him and go find someone else. We did buy Holtby for pennies which makes it easier to sell him, the club does not feel (nor should it) that they must invest in the player past what is reasonable. If we had bought him for 30 million pounds it would be a different story. 

&gt; I just feel he's more than good enough to be a fantastic AMC for us at the end of the day. He's proven it in a harder league than Eriksen, a similar league to the EPL too and also he's half English so adapted super easy. It's win/win.

That may be the case, however I would say Eriksen showed last year, in a spurs shirt under somewhat difficult circumstances, in the premier league (where Holtby is yet to prove himself) that he is a fantastic player 


&gt; We've RUINED him. We have. A team, with CL football, lost their talisman to a team without CL football, and we threw him in at CM and rip the shit out of him. It's almost sad.

Sometimes players don't work out it happens everywhere. Kagawa at united (where a lot fans have a similar argument to yours), Torres at Chelsea etc. Maybe its the system that doesn't suit him, his relationships in the side or with the manager(s). I think you may be overreacting, we havent ruined him he just hasnt made the position his own

true,JimmyImpersonator,dalek,Dalek,"Thoughts on the episode:


“The Doctor is old now! Quick, introduce a romantic interest!”

Cue the most awkward first meeting between two romantic interests in history.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Oh, I’ve got to go inside of this Dalek. There’s only one thing to do now. Bring along the ONE girl in the universe who should absolutely never end up inside a Dalek under any circumstances EVER!”

BRILLIANT.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Gather round, children – this here is the center of all evil inside a Dalek’s mind!”

GREAT! You’ve got weapons and explosives, so-

“It is purified evil, it is what deprives them of mercy and all goodness, it is pure concentrated malice all in one place!”

Uh...nice. Fry it. Perform an Evilobotomy. Nuke the fluke. Slap the crap. 

“This single thing is responsible for the Dalek’s inability to feel compassion or any kind of kindness imaginable.”

Uuuhhh...weapons? Explosives? Evil box of evil goes boom?

“Right then, let’s move along!”

WHAT. 

Y’ALL BETTER NOT END UP CLIMBING BACK TO THAT THING LATER TO DESTROY IT AFTER RUSTY INVARIABLY TURNS ON YOU!

(Called the turning against them bit, not the climbing back to destroy the thing bit. Still, they ended up messing with his brain anyways so I wasn’t too far off)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“THE MALFUNCTION HAS BEEN REPAIRED! EXTERMINATE! EXTERMINATE!”

WHAT DID I SAY? 

On a different note: Rusty, dude, they are literally still inside of you with weapons, explosives and shit. Do you REALLY think it’s a good idea to go exterminating bloody immediately? 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“I AM NOT A GOOD DALEK, YOU ARE A GOOD DALEK!”

That is amazing. No joke, just my favorite part of the episode.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MISSY, YOU ARE CREEPING ME THE MATH OUT!

...............

...........................

......................................well, don’t *stop*.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Overall: I liked this one. That moment when Rusty saw hatred in the Doctor was powerful and terrifying, especially after the Doctor sacrificed that soldier earlier without so much as a second thought. 12 is turning out brutal and that thing Clara said about ‘shooting people then crying about it’ definitely applies to him too. 

Capaldi’s Doctor is so good. I love that he’s so unpredictable. This episode I’ve constantly been on the edge of my seat, terrified that he’s going to make me hate a character I love, not due to poor portrayal but because that’s just the way 12 is now.

I will probably flesh these ideas out more in the analysis thread but here are my impressions:

I am getting the feeling that Missy might put the Doctor on trial or something to that effect. By saving the people he kills or lets die she may be setting up to confront him later. Or maybe she is trying to save him from the judgement of someone else since she claims she loves him.

Journey Blue and Danny Pink. Is there any connection there?

I think that the Doctor is spending a lot of time on his own which we know from the past with Seven, War, and Ten that this is not a good idea. I also think the Doctor is spending a lot of time in his own head as he seems to misremember when he is supposed be and forgets names and is seriously questioning whether or not he is a good man.

The Doctor obviously has an issue with soldiers especially in this incarnation. I am sure Clara dating Danny will not sit well with him at all, especially as Clara decides to spend more time with him and less with the Doctor.

Now that the Doctor knows that Daleks can be relatively good sans insanity, external meddling, and time breaking events, how will this effect his future interactions with the Daleks?

I am definitely getting the feeling that he doesn't like doors. I mean appearing in a supplies cupboard, kicking in the TARDIS door, and appearing smoothly and nonchalantly as to surprise people. He really doesn't want to be noticed unless he makes himself known.

I will probably have more come Wednesday.

I always want Coutinho to play but he was invisible vs City so I put Sterling at the tip of the diamond. Lallana and Hendo have the energy to do all the running for Gerrard. Can for Lallana could also work, even though he may offer slightly less going forward, as I think the front three are perfectly capable of getting goals by themselves.

The [first memory that Clara brings back](https://i.imgur.com/EfgYC1V.png) to the Dalek is of one of Van Statten's men being shot by a Dalek ([around 21:00 in S01E06](https://i.imgur.com/EKbI9yY.png)).",0,1409428222,null,0,false,0,ck4unql,t3_2f113q,t1_ck4unql,t3_2f113q,null,1427279822,346,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,346

true,[deleted],null,null,"This will sound really fucked up, but fuck it I'll say what I'm thinking anyway. 

Imagine being a police officer.

A girl walks into the station, says she's been raped. You sit her down, give her a cup of tea, tell her you can reassure her that you'll protect her and the police are fully behind any citizen who has had a crime committed against them and that not just as your job, but beyond your uniform and badge number and as a human being you will do absolutely everything to help her. 

She says she was at a house party, sniffing cocaine and taking ecstasy and when she ran out of cigarettes... as I'm sure if you've partaken in this lifestyle that running out of cigarettes, there is really nothing worse.. so she decided to suck a lads dick for 5cigarettes. After this happened, she had smoked 3 of those cigarettes and gave away 2 to her friends, who also felt the same addictive feeling of needing a cigarette. 

She then said to one guy 'I'll let you fuck me for 15cigarettes', as she heard he had a sleeve at home he was smoking off. She was then fucked by this lad, who gave her 15 cigarettes. As the night wore on she had about 2 cigarettes left. The lad who previously had fucked her felt her tits on his way out of the house, which she objected to at all costs. He got really agitated saying he'd just fucked her, has her number, wants to speak to her again, and only an hr ago was fucking her so why is she so full of hate against him?

She explained it was only for cigarettes, but he proceeded to push her into a room saying why are you shouting me. She continued shouting at him, but at this point she gasping for drugs. He had 3 half gram bags of cocaine on him that she could have one, for another shag. So she shagged him again. After he gave her the bag, she had a good line off it and he leant in, as she was still naked, and began to fuck her again as she was saying 'STOP', although slightly muted and not as strongly as she felt when he felt her tits. That is rape. 

Now if a policeman heard all that and said 'so you've been raped', after learning she gave her body up 2times before this for cigarettes and drugs, me in that situation mate I wouldn't think that's the same level of rape as just somebody in a taxi with a taxi driver who pulls off onto a road that leads onto a farmers house.

What I'm saying is, is basically we don't know the full picture such as you are but putting it from the perspective of those whos jobs it is to make sure it all makes sense, in certain situations would have had me thinking, on a personal and not professional level.. I'd be thinking 'you asked for it', not knowing how great the need of a cigarette really is in that situation if I'd never smoked a cigarette, or done drugs.

The episode its self certainly does mirror ""Dalek"" in quite a few more ways than one, up to and including footage from the episode itself. However this does not tarnish the episode or script because if nothing else it was a fantastic re telling of a great what i would call a classic (its been 9 years) Doctor Who episode. The way it mirrors the end of the episode i was almost expecting the doctor to say hes seen this situation before and that's why he declines not because shes a solider but never mind, he could remember the madame De pompadour so what are the chances he remembers van Stattons museum.

All in all it was one of the best episodes i have seen and is certainly up there with some of the most gut wrenching finales, but then again i feel this entire series will be one of the best if not for the amazing cinematic scenes and quality of the script but for the incredible acting from every character.

Oh man I really enjoyed that episode.

I’m completely sold on Peter Capaldi as the Doctor at this point. I had very little doubt that he wouldn’t be fantastic as the Doctor but his performance in these past two episodes has exceeded my expectations. In addition, Capaldi and Clara have very good chemistry. I didn’t really think Eleventh and Clara were as bad as people said it was, but it’s really noticeable how much a better fit Clara is with Capaldi’s Doctor.

I think they could have spent a bit more time on increasing the tension when the kid asks Danny if he’s killed a civilian, but that’s just my opinion.

As for the music, I love what Murray Gold is doing. When the soldiers are waiting for the Daleks to enter their ship the first time, I’m reminded a bit of John Williams with the horns in his Star Wars scores.

One thing I didn't get was how they went through the Dalek's eyepiece.

true,Halk,scot-lanarkshire,Lanarkshire,"&gt; Is there a realistic possibility of Balkan style ethnic/religious pogroms?

That's what I said. A pogrom is not ethnic cleansing. Although you could call ethnic cleansing a pogrom.

&gt;A pogrom is a violent riot aimed at massacre or persecution of an ethnic or religious group, particularly one aimed at Jews. The term originally entered the English language to describe 19th- and 20th-century attacks on Jews in the Russian Empire (mostly within the Pale of Settlement in present-day Ukraine and Belarus). Similar attacks against Jews at other times and places also became retrospectively known as pogroms. The word is now also sometimes used to describe publicly sanctioned purgative attacks against non-Jewish ethnic or religious groups

Think EDL marches but going further. Going into predominately Muslim areas to attack and cause property damage. There may be murders and there will certainly be serious injuries and destroyed homes. Think the London riots but instead of shops being attacked homes being attacked.",0,1409428754,null,0,false,0,ck4uvp5,t3_2eugo3,t1_ck4uvp5,t1_ck4uixr,null,1427279718,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

 [**Gerrymandering**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;In the process of setting [electoral districts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district), __gerrymandering__ is a practice that attempts to establish a political advantage for a particular party or group by [manipulating district boundaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_delimitation) to create partisan advantaged districts. The resulting district apportionment is known as a __gerrymander__ (/ˈdʒɛriˌmændər/); however, that word can also refer to the process. When used to allege that a given party is gaining disproportionate power, the term *gerrymandering* has negative connotations.

I'm skeptical. The HRA is based on the ECHR which says 

&gt; Article 4: 3. For the purpose of this Article the term “forced or compulsory labour” shall not include: ... (b) any service of a military character or, in case of conscientious objectors in countries where they are recognised, service exacted instead of compulsory military service;

There's a second question: does Poland actually have a positive right to extradite for this? They'd be doing this with an EAW. It seems from wikipedia that:

* the general rule is that the offence for which you are to be extradited has to be a crime in both countries.

* there are exceptions to this - rape, arson, computer crime, selling nuclear weapons. Dodging military service doesn't appear to be on that list.

- Stoke set up with 3 very tight banks of 2, keeping the middle of the park very tight. They were organized and disciplined in their defense. This meant our tempo was really slow, made Jovetic ineffective as all his flicks and one twos were picked up on and generally made us struggle through the middle.


- As a result, the wings were more open. Sagna and Kolarov did not do well enough to take advantage. Zaba may have done better and changed the game. When Navas came on this was obviously exposed. Watch it back, there were like 10 minutes of pure dominance down the wing before Hughes subbed on a left sided player to sure it up.

- Their tactic was defend, set pieces and counter attack. It was actually *very* similar to how Hughes set up QPR in the famous 3-2. Their goal was very reminiscent of their goals in that game, a quick break.

Definitely need some extra cover for midfield in light of Faurlin's tragedy - I like what I saw from Mutch, but I think he'll pick up a few cards this season. Guess that justifies Harry's man coming in.

Good to see Phillips and Hoilett in their appropriate roles, both of whom look sharp against the likes of Sunderland. Goes without saying that it's home games against teams like these where we need the gooey core of survival points. I really wish Traoré had got that goal, and I still think he can be useful for us this season. 

Relieved for Austin's first Premier League goal, and hopefully getting off the mark is a monkey off of his back. Thought Zamora was effective at doing his job when he came on too.

Bringing on Taarabt at the end was a bit of a strange decision for me when we were only up by one.

true,quantumpenguins,tennant,Tennant,"Well well well. Gotta say, so many elements of this episode were unexpected, and they did a good job on the ""*Next Time*"" section last week on not revealing what was happening. I will admit, I was saying that I was sick of the past few series's *constant* use of superlatives, (""the doctor's darkest hour"", for example was used *a lot*) but really, the inside of a Dalek is a pretty good candidate for the ""most dangerous place in the universe"".

I can't get over how dark Capaldi's Doctor is. Unlike Eleven, he doesn't seem to show *any* obvious remorse over individual deaths. He tells Journey to just get over her brother's death and stop crying, and he mentioned that the other soldier was ""doomed"" anyway and did nothing to prevent his death. This is totally different to his last incarnation, who took every individual so seriously and risked everything on a regular basis to save one stranger, even when we all knew he was being stupid. What we have here is someone who seems to have swung far too much to other way, and can only see the big picture. Either that, or he is in fact far more sensitive to these things so is making more of an effort to suppress his emotions.

I really really like Danny Pink. Understated, awkward, yet with a presumably brilliant back story.  I think the series will benefit from a slightly subtler character for a while, don't you? As a companion I can see him really balancing up well alongside Twelve and Clara. Plus, his reaction to Clara's onslaught of flirting was excellently done, and we all suffered with him a little bit I think.

And that schoolboy was a total prick by the way.

The premise I thought was very interesting. I thought it odd though how they took a Dalek seeking to destroy his entire race as ""good"". He said nothing about helping the weak, protecting the innocent or regret for his species's actions - only a wish to destroy the Dalek race. I think this was sloppy writing really. For me, it just screamed ""malfunction"" to me rather than ""morality"". That said, it did serve to display the Doctor's hate for the Daleks - he automatically assumes someone who harbours hate towards the Daleks as ""moral"" and ""good"".

For me, the inside of the Dalek was interesting, although I don't understand why they didn't deal with the ""hate center"" immediately. If that is the reason behind a Dalek's ""evil-ness""... shouldn't you find it more important?

I did really love the scene where the Doctor is trying to re-programme the Dalek. I thought the visuals were a little cheap, but the dialogue made up for it in my mind. And the bit where Rusty went from seeing all the beauty to all the hate in the Doctor's mind was inevitable but still brilliant to watch.

I think that most viewers' feelings were mixed when Rusty went on the killing spree. The horror of realising it's all gone wrong and he's embraced all the hate to, well, the relief of knowing he's helping the team. Yes he's neglected the point of the re-programming but, surely the hate is well directed, yeah? As brilliantly as the situation turned out in the end, it still seems oddly dissatisfying.

As for the ""you are a good Dalek"" line. It could have killed me.

Overall, I am loving the way the series is going so far. Unlike Eleven who always had an idea of what was ""good"" and ""evil"", Twelve wants to be good whilst also trying to be practical and is finding that not everything is black and white, and he hates himself for it. I think he's really going to find some comfort in Danny, even if he doesn't want to.

Also, extra thought here. Anyone think that Danny might be an ex-UNIT soldier? Would really spice some things up.

true,Ledley_Kingslayer,null,null,"Some thoughts:

The overarching theme for this season seems to be ""whether the ends justify the means."" In this episode, and its predecessor, the Doctor has been perfectly happy to sacrifice (or murder depending on how you look at it) characters without much hesitation. But in his downtime he struggles with whether he's allowed to be this new man of action and still be ""a good man."" Other people have speculated about Missy's meetings with the Doctor's sacrifices, and I wager they're all going to play a large part in the resolution of the question at the end of this series: ""Am I a good man?""

As for the episode itself, I think it's incredibly difficult to do the Daleks justice in a single episode. I appreciate the attempt, but unfortunately this one fell short of the mark for me. Peter Capaldi and Jenna Coleman were both excellent but I think the script let them down. It just made no sense to me why the Doctor would adamantly hold to the maxim: ""All Daleks are inherently evil,"" and then agree to fix one up. I know he isn't supposed to be Sherlock, but I expect the Doctor to be at least smart enough to see why this wouldn't be such a good idea.

Also, really excited to see more of Mr. Pink. The presence of a PTSD sufferer signals to me that Moffat's ready to write some more complex and mature characters. I just hope he's capable of doing a good job with it.

So overall alright episode. Excited to see where the rest of the series goes, but I felt all of the good things in this episode were good for the overall series, and not this particular episode.

He has more space to run at players and make crosses, which he is fantastic at. And he won't have to run as much to play the high press, as Holtby will cover half the width of the field. Holtby in the center would allow Lamela and Eriksen to conserve energy while allowing us to better execute the high press.

My only issue comes with the interchanging of the attacking midfield 3.

Joe simply doesn't make the grade anymore.

He had nothing to do all game, and rarely does. All he has to do is keep the ball ticking over when we're in possession, and clear up a few loose balls. The only thing that's required of him is to keep his concentration for the rare occasion he's called upon.

He rarely does it.

The one time he was called upon today, he failed. Then, as he often does, he later steamed out and cleared a Stoke player out on the edge of the penalty area contesting a lose high ball. It's his stupid way of trying to compensate for when he gets things wrong or feels he's not playing well.

But it's counter productive, it just makes him even more error prone and a liability.

If he got that challenge wrong Stoke tap the ball into an empty net, or get a penalty.

He just doesn't inspire confidence at all, quite the opposite in fact.

He played 13 matches from the end of January to the end of the season. That's more than halfway through his loan. And he fell out with Magath (his ex-manager from Schalke), who is psychotic and more likely than not had it out for Holtby (who he slagged off to the media several times).

I'm seeing widespread praise for this episode here and on /r/Gallifrey and its script was fucking appalling! 

All the characters were inexplicably idiots! 

Why didn't they take the daleks gun away?

Why didn't the doctor warn them about the antibodies before going inside? If he had then no one would have died and he clearly had knowledge of their existence prior to entry.

Did they have any kind of mission briefing before shrinking themselves and heading into the dalek? It doesn't seem like it because then half the things that did go wrong wouldn't have.

How have these rebels been fighting daleks all this time with weapons that appear to be completely ineffective against daleks? 

And on that note, what are they rebelling against? If they're fighting daleks surely that's just a war, unless they're like freelance dalek hunters or something, which would again bring up the question of how they can be so fucking bad at their jobs.

And what the fuck was up with the Doctor denying that soldier girl at the end because she's a soldier? 

Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge Stewart is the Doctor's oldest and arguably best friend, and he was also A FUCKING SOLDIER! Where has this sudden hate for soldiers just randomly appeared from?

Seems to me like it was just to tie in a single fucking line to Clara's new boyfriend story line, which I would qualify as piss poor writing. 

The reaction in here blows my mind because last week we've got an episode with no plot holes, no blatant lapses in character, and self contained plot that actually made sense and everyone shit all over it and then had the gall to blame the writing.

I liked the direction, noticed some continuity errors but it was so poorly done from a writing standpoint that it just ruined everything.

Not the first.

&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal

&gt;The Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal refers to the existence of widespread child sexual abuse in the town of Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England, between 1997 and 2013, and its alleged cover-up.

&gt;In 2010, five men of Pakistani heritage were found guilty of a series of sexual offences against girls as young as twelve.

&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochdale_sex_trafficking_gang

&gt;The Rochdale sex trafficking gang was a group of men who preyed on under-age teenage girls in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, England. They were convicted of sex trafficking on 8 May 2012; other offences included rape, trafficking girls for sex and conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with a child.[1] 47 girls were identified as victims of child sexual exploitation during the police investigation.[2][3][4] The men were all British Pakistanis (except for one from Afghanistan) and from Muslim backgrounds, and the girls were White; this has led to national discussion of whether the crimes were racially motivated, or, conversely, whether the early failure to investigate them was linked to the authorities' fear of being accused of racism.

&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby_sex_gang

&gt;The Derby sex gang was a group of men who sexually abused up to a hundred girls in Derby, England,[1][2] in one of the most severe cases of sexual abuse in recent times.[3] In 2010, after an undercover investigation by Derbyshire police, members of the group were charged with 75 offences relating to 26 girls.

&gt;The gang of thirteen men, most of whom were from South Asian backgrounds, lived throughout Derby and the police believed they met through a shared attraction for young girls.

&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_sex_gang

&gt;The Oxford sex gang was a group of seven men who preyed extensively on pre-teen and under-age teenage girls in Oxford, England, from 2006 before their belated arrest and prosecution. In May 2013, they were convicted of sexual offences including rape, conspiracy to commit rape, arranging or facilitating child prostitution, trafficking for sexual exploitation, and procuring a miscarriage.

&gt;The gang comprised two sets of brothers, Mohammed Karrar, 38, and Bassam Karrar, 33, and Akhtar Dogar, 32, and Anjum Dogar, 31, with Kamar Jamil, 27, Assad Hussain, 32, and Zeeshan Ahmed, 27. Five were of Pakistani Muslim heritage and two, the Karrar brothers, of Eritrean Muslim heritage.


&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telford_sex_gang

&gt;The Telford Sex Gang was a group of seven men who preyed extensively on pre-teen and under-age teenage girls in Telford, England before their arrest and prosecution. In cases stretching over two years to late 2012,[1] they were convicted of sexual offences including rape, controlling child prostitution, causing child prostitution and trafficking for the purpose of prostitution.

&gt;Gang members

&gt;Ahdel Ali, 25, was given a 26-year sentence including 18 years in prison.

&gt;His brother Mubarek Ali, 29, received a 22-year sentence including 14 years in prison. 

&gt;The two brothers were put on the sex offenders register for life.

In my own experience this cold, dispassionate question is delivered to all victims of crime in the same way and I have also been told to same (for a lesser offence that had taken place in a family dispute) I was given the option there and then to press charges, but told that I had to decide now - I suppose it makes sense if you've got several other incidents/victims to deal with - it's not like your ordering food at a restaurant and can decide later.

She was given the option to press charges, if she felt that justice needed to be done then she should have answered ""Yes"" and to hell with it.

Sadly, if she wants to blame some people for letting her down, I think she's really pointing the finger at the wrong party. The people who are responsible for not having her back are these so-called friends she had at her party. If she was completely passed out and they were still coherent enough to take photos and get her to her bed, then someone should have noticed the absence of this guy, or noticed him creeping to/from her room.

As for Judge Mowat’s comments, it's a sad fact I have observed firsthand in town centers, sober men frequent the high streets at 2-4pm walking around not dressed for clubbing and with no intent of revelling. Instead, they look for an inebriated girl who has gotten separated from her group and is stumbling away from the town center towards home, they will either stalk or even brazenly come alongside them like a friend ""helping"" her to walk and get home. The police do not seem to be aware of this activity, as they are concentrating more on preventing violence. I have stopped a number of guys to ask how they know this girl and having gotten a shady answer I've stuck around, and waited for her friends to turn up, or until the ""friend"" simply walks away realising that they're out of luck.

I have never seen this kind of behavior the other way round.

www.lawteacher.net/criminal-law/intent-specific-basic.php

Therefore, 'recklessness' can substitute actual intent to fulfil the mental aspect of the crime. (This isn't the same for Murder, for example.) 

Director of Public Prosecutions v Majewski [1977] A.C. 443

There is evidence that the girl was incapable of giving consent, and the lad cannot use intoxication as a defence, except to possibly argue that his inebriation made it harder for him to tell that full consent wasn't given, and that to his mind, she wanted intercourse.

Unless you arseholes for jurors, the girl, from what she says, was perfectly within her rights to go to court, and a good judge would be able to make sure the jury deliberated on the correct points of law.  

Edit: My apologies. Re-read my law notes :P Ignore the part about 'recklessness'. Rape has 'intent' as part of the statutory definition. However, it is seen to be 'no defence', unless you were completely wasted. However, the fact that someone could actually get himself into a position to actually commit the crime whilst in that state would likely rebut that argument.

&gt;Why didn't they take the daleks gun away?

Maybe because they didn't want the good dalek to suddenly turn bad, you saw how easy it was for the dalek to alert the fleet.

&gt;Why didn't the doctor warn them about the antibodies before going inside? If he had then no one would have died and he clearly had knowledge of their existence prior to entry.

Perhaps because people dying makes the episode interesting, we'd all love everyone in every episode to live. Also, perhaps the antibodies were at the back of the Doctor's mind. This new Doctor is different to others, his attitude to death has clearly changed. We could see this in is comments made about the deceased soldier when they entered the protein goo.

&gt;Did they have any kind of mission briefing before shrinking themselves and heading into the dalek? It doesn't seem like it because then half the things that did go wrong wouldn't have.

You're over thinking. I'm sure a mission briefing and nothing going wrong would make a really interesting episode..

&gt;How have these rebels been fighting daleks all this time with weapons that appear to be completely ineffective against daleks?

A dalek was killed by a human laser in the fight, maybe it requires a well placed shot. The rebels were fighting a loosing war as well. Perhaps their advantage was not in gun battles but in space attacks. See the Halo series as an example, the Covenant were effective against the humans in space but bad in gun fights. The humans were fighting for a pyrrhic victory.

&gt;And on that note, what are they rebelling against? If they're fighting daleks surely that's just a war, unless they're like freelance dalek hunters or something, which would again bring up the question of how they can be so fucking bad at their jobs.

Again a stupid point really. How do you know they were bad at their jobs? We just got a snippet of a larger conflict, in which the humans were hiding.

&gt;And what the fuck was up with the Doctor denying that soldier girl at the end because she's a soldier?

Because that's the Doctors new character. He's been through so many wars now he sees soldiers simply as a facilitator for ongoing death. Perhaps it's a one dimentional view of soldiers, but that just shows how troubled his past has been. Clara's attitude may also proove that humans are just as intelligent as time lords in terms of emotion.

&gt;Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge Stewart is the Doctor's oldest and arguably best friend, and he was also A FUCKING SOLDIER! Where has this sudden hate for soldiers just randomly appeared from?

The Doctor's character has clearly changed after the huge war he went through, doesn't surprise me really.

I tried to address all your queries, all my points are just theories, but theories that seem rather obvious to me.

I'm glad we've got that firmly established. Now you might want to try to convince your fellow rape apologists of that simple fact, because they sure as hell are not acting accordingly.

&gt; What I am saying is being drunk does not mean you are unable to consent. You can be drunk and still be able to consent. 

Well, that is what you are saying *now*. But you've conveniently moved the goalpost. At first you said, and I quote (again), emphasis mine: ""*Losing your capacity to consent* does not provide evidence that rape actually occurred."" Which is falsified by your own citation.

Anyone in a state of ""extreme inebriation"" is obviously in no shape to consent to anything. We're talking about extreme inebriation here, not just having had a few drinks. Which also proves that the article's statement that you're so up in arms about:

""… that a state of extreme inebriation is **not** one where a person can give **valid consent** for sex and that **this in itself is evidence of rape.**""

…is completely correct as well as consistent with your citation.

Look, it's not as if this is rocket science. If someone has manifestly lost the capacity to make a rational decision, *you do not fuck them*.

The reason the score is what it was was the 2-0 within 3 minutes. That sunk you. You were always chasing the game and Martinez's style meant he was going to go gung ho. McGeady for Eto'o basically meant that by the end you had a 2-4-4.

Distin and Jagielka compounded this by looking very nervy and constantly not having space. In addition you can't really play Naismith where he is because he's playing as a false nine or a second striker and not linking between Barry/McCarthy to Lukaku, he plays far too forward for that. This mean there was a massive hole in the centre of midfield that was exploited this. To make it even *worse* Chelsea quickly realised that Coleman and Baines' bombing forward consistently left space on the flanks and poor positioning meant that people were constantly caught out.

People are going to slate Lukaku but he's looking sharp IMO, hit the crossbar and his positioning constantly exposed space for Naismith which led to the first goal. He's playing up by himself and the lack of solidity at midfield meant he was constantly just getting headers. Unlucky and he'll take some stick but I thought he was playing well. As a Scot Naismith is something else. I don't know what Martinez has put in his Irn-Bru but wow. Mirallas as well looks so sharp. McGeady was good on the wing. Just collectively the team lost their head at 3-2 and just all bombed forward to score, schoolboy stuff. West Brom is a necessary 3 points as is a shakier looking Crystal Palace.

You cannot chase Chelsea from 2 goals down going gung ho. You cannot forsake the centre of the park against Terry/Matic/Fabregas/Costa spine. It is pure folly. Arsenal tried it and were humped. Everton gave it a bloody bloody good go and if Eto'o had made it 5-4 when he did then who knows but you need defensive solidity in the centre and that is what was lacking today.

If you backtrack on the classics, there's William Hartnell who is on the surface an old, wise doctor, but still has that sense of adventure and curiosity. Another classic Doctor, Colin Baker, was very unpredictable and a bit of an egomania (according to Wikipedia) and sees himself superior. 

The current season, Peter Capaldi's doctor seems to be going back to a darker, all-business Doctor, much like the classics. It's a complete turnaround from David Tennant and Matt Smith and a different take of ""dark"" from Eccleston. Personally, I find him an effective one!

One thing is for sure: though he appears human, he is still an alien, an outsider from Earth so he has different quirks that makes him more endearing.

true,Greaseball01,pertwee,Pertwee,"Your explanations are poor. Let me show you why. I don't feel like quoting though so I'm just going to have numbers correspond to your points, sorry if it's confusing but I think we'll be okay.

1) If they trusted the Dalek enough to bring it on board their super secret ship hidden in an asteroid belt with no sufficient method of imprisoning it and then were okay with shrinking themselves down to a microscopic level so they could go inside it and give it medical attention then I think it's fair to say that they trusted it enough to not try and kill them for doing something as sensible as taking it's gun away. Plus, how is it going to do anything to them if it has no gun? I know it can do the face sucker thing but the simple solution then is to shut the door, or even better, remove the sucker too.

2) You can't just throw death into the plot to make it interesting if it doesn't make sense within the fictional universe of the show. We need to be able to maintain suspension of disbelief and expecting us to accept dumb choices by the characters because it makes the episode more interesting is not good writing. On the second point, you're speculating that the Doctor was feeling forgetful at the time? So forgetful that from the moment he was pitched the idea of going inside the dalek to thinking it over, going back to get Clara, coming back, and the pitching the idea to her that it never crossed his mind, once in that time, to bring up the only risk that they would be facing when entering the dalek? Conflict is not acceptable if it has to be forced in this way. Good writing is finding reasonable ways to introduce conflict into a story, if you just shoe horn it in because it's what the story needs then you have failed as a writer.

3) A mission briefing would be a great time to, y'know, actually introduce to the characters who are going on the mission, actually tell us what the mission is so that the Doctor didn't have to stop constantly and explain the plot to people who should probably have already known because they need to because they're on the goddamn mission. 

4) You're assuming things that aren't even alluded to in the episode in order to patch up plot breaking holes. My point, which I could have sworn I brough up in the actual comment but whatever, is why didn't they use the same technology that daleks use in their guns? We see in the episode that it's hugely more effective than their own weapons and if they've ever managed to scrap a single dalek then they have no reason not to be using that technology. The fact that nobody in this fictional universe has noticed this issue and brought it up is a massive lapse in logic both for the plot and the characters.

5) I know they were bad at their jobs because of the completely ineffective resistance they put up against what turned out to actually be a very small number of daleks.

6) Regenerations don't change fundamental beliefs held by a character for centuries, I'll grant you they can change attitudes perhaps but as I pointed out in the next part, The Doctor has had so many very good friends who were soldiers that it seems difficult for me to believe that this single regeneration would change all that, based on no real experience, because if it was based on the time war and all the other conflicts he's been involved in which you allude to then it would probably have been a bit more gradual than not at all.

7) I assume the huge war you're referring to is The Time War. Captain Jack was a soldier, he met him after the time war and had no issue with him. Let's go for a more recent example, remember the soldiers in Nightmare in Silver? He cooperated with them and seemed to rather like them as long as they weren't planning on blowing up the planet, which is perfectly reasonable. The reason for that is of course because Nightmare in Silver was well written, this episode was not.

- I don't know, use your imagination. They could be rebelling against some kind of Dalek occupation. That's not a plot hole its just not mentioned. 

- He's never been too keen on soldiers in the new series, maybe since he was a soldier in the time war and did some stuff he's not proud of.

&gt;That attitude has been promoted by religious leaders, he believes. “On one level, most imams in the UK are simply using their puritanical sermons to promote the wearing of the hijab and even the burka among their female adherents. But the dire result can be the brutish misogyny we see in the Oxford sex ring.”

4) they didn't have Dalek technology, yeah they had a Dalek but not the tools and resources to mass produce guns based on it's own.

5) They tried their best against the Daleks, they were retreating and managed to knock out one of them. Daleks are tough to destroy with ineffective weapons which was all they had.

6) They kinda do. 

7) The Doctor didn't like Captain Jack straight off, plus he wasn't a soldier, he was a time agent at the point posing as a soldier. Plus your example of him liking the soldiers in Nightmare in Silver further proves the points of each regeneration having different attitudes.

First she was the Impossible Girl (Ugh) saving the Doctor and the Universe, but now, she'll enter a whole new universe; dating!

The parts I actually wanted to see were totally ignored. Where were they? When were they? In previous seasons we'd get a brief synopsis from the Doctor or a secondary character explaining where they were and what was going on. In this episode we got ""We're on the ship Aristotle, and we're fighting Daleks"". Anything else we need to know? No? Really?! The Daleks could be starting a second Great Time War, and the Doctor is content with leaving right after they convert ""Rusty"" the Dalek to the cause. Riiight.

And finally, the characters doing stupid things. Wow. The Doctor linking minds with the ""Rusty"", even though all the Daleks are connected through a hive mind, as seen in Asylum of the Daleks. So, ""Rusty"", being evil for a bit, can then transmit all of the Daleks losses throughout time to the Dalek fleet, which is exactly what the Doctor didn't want in ""Genesis of the Daleks"", prior knowledge of the future. However, we don't know if this is the future, considering we have no idea when thid takes place. Also, the Daleks show no signs of superior technology. Why didn't they teleport Rusty home? Why didn't they just blow up the ship, and pick Rusty up later, because we've seen Daleks survive worse than that. Also, Rusty is perfectly fine with rolling around with his GREATEST ENEMY, explosives and weapons inside of him. What. I thought Daleks were intelligent?! 

Edit 1: Also, the gun. Man, that was efficient. It'd be great if all Daleks had one of those. Wait, why don't they?

Edit 2: The varying effectiveness of the human weaponry. In the big fight scene, with Daleks and humans duking it out, we see at least one Dalek get destroyed be a few lazer rounds. Cool. So how the hell could the 5+ soldiers not take out Rusty in his initial breakout then?! They had one target. One. Uno.

Edit 3: Rusty's interior (or should I say inferior) defenses. When the poor unfortunate redshir-I mean-soldier gets vapourised by the Dalek antibodies, the Doctor goes on about how the Dalek cannot control them, just like humans can't control theirs. But humans aren't robotic killing machines. You're telling me that the Daleks have no control over their antibodies? Gee, that seems like quite a weakness, that somehow hasn't been exploited. Ever. Like, in a war. Where all of creation hangs in the balance. Seems like the Time Lords didn't try everything.

true,intangible-tangerine,eng-Bristol,Brizzlefoshizzle,"Unfortunately this level of callousness doesn't surprise me. I know personally of a case of a family of a man with quite severe Down's syndrome being threatened with an end to his disability benefits because he could pass a basic fitness test and was therefore judged 'fit to work' 

He had been doing simple tasks at the care home where he stayed part time, such as sweeping the floor or folding the laundry, but this was supervised, the idea that he would be able to fill out an application form or get to an interview on his own is just absurd. 

I'm all for getting disabled people in to work where it's feasible, such as the work which is being done by this [inspiring Hotel company in India](http://ibnlive.in.com/videos/449081/veer-lemon-tree-hotels-encourages-employment-of-people-with-disabilities.html) but taking support away from people who genuinely need support isn't going to help with that at all. 

What would help is more engagement with employers to show them how they can accommodate people with disabilities without losing competitiveness, simple things like making sure new offices are built to be wheelchair accessible makes a huge difference. 

On the same page I'm all for a sensible immigration policy where the rights of people to remain long term in the country if they don't have citizenship, family support or work is up for consideration, but it must be nuanced, it must take account of individual needs.

It's really blatant that the government is just trying to get Daily-Mail pleasing Headlines 'Benefits bill cut by X amount' 'X no of immigrants deported' and that they only give a damn about the individuals affected by poor, target driven decisions when the media and the public kick up a fuss.

The caricature you're using has been surprisingly effective at shutting people up, but sorry, it's not going to wash any more.

We know from the report that fears over appearing racist really was a factor in the failure to act over the Rotherham rapes.  As far as I can tell, this is an uncontested fact.

I fully understand that political correctness was intended to help fight casual racism, but in this case it provided a shield for unspeakable acts of evil.

Nobody reasonable wants a return to the days where people could casually use slurs like 'Paki', but political correctness is also impeding criticism of completely fair-game topics like Islam.  This has to stop.

And this isn't the only time it happened.  Look back to the Islamic takeover of Birmingham schools.  An official report concluded that [""Fears of Islamophobia gave activists free rein in Birmingham schools""](http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jul/18/trojan-horse-birmingham-scathing-report-islamophobia).   Also look at how tens of thousands of British women were subject to genital mutilation with no prosecutions.

These are all serious issues where people felt intimidated from speaking out and part of the problem has been the overzealous use of political correctness.

My point is, we can objectively judge the quality of the writing to a certain extent and that's where, I would say, it is perfectly okay for me to have disagreement with people.",0,1409436497,null,0,false,0,ck4y4bl,t3_2f113q,t1_ck4y4bl,t1_ck4x8yt,null,1427278136,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

true,MatthewWilkes,eng-Bristol,Brizzle,"Burglary isn't a level of theft in the UK. It's entering a home with intent to perform one of a list of offences, including theft and GBH. It's the same offence as ""breaking and entering"", so it's an aggravated form of trespass. That kind-of makes sense, as trespass is such a low-level offence, but personally I don't think the limitation of offences makes sense. It's not breaking and entering if you enter someone's home to damage property, for example.

Armed robbery isn't an offence in the UK. Robbery, which need not be armed or even involve injury, is a combination of theft and common assault. The punishment for robbery is approximately equal to rape. Rape has assault as part of the core of the crime. It's not possible to rape without assault.

I think perhaps rather than worry about what offences are bundled together is to remember that people can commit more than one crime at once. It's entirely possible for someone to be guilty of burglary, GBH and  rape from the same act.

Rape isn't analogous to theft, a crime that varies so much it can involve a victim that's not even present and that doesn't feel a victim, all the way up to having a gun stuck in the back of your head and your wallet demanded.

Yes, I know it's perpetually funny for some to paint a picture Daily Mail readers foaming at the mouth over 'PC gone mad', but the facts appear to be that people really have been intimidated and that this is a significant problem.

BTW, I'm not coming at this from a right or left wing angle (although I am left of center).  I'm an atheist who's been critical of religion for decades.  People called me an anti-Catholic bigot for writing about the Catholic church during the Catholic child-abuse scandals, but the taboos erected  against criticizing Islam are on a whole other level. 

I suppose I should also admit to being quite libertarian (in the dictionary sense of the word) in my views on free-speech.  I worry that creating strong taboos regarding discussion on Islam, immigration, religion and race is playing straight into the hands of extremists.  If reasonable people don't allow discussion on these things, then the far-right may take up the slack.

Nothing in this episode was even slightly realistic.  Miniaturization?  Silly, and the idea that it would be a routine medical technique is beyond ludicrous when you consider how incredibly risky it would be.  Then the idea that the breathing air wouldn't be miniaturized along with the people, but presumably the dissolved and intestinal gases would be?  Utterly ludicrous.  Then the idea that the Dalek vehicle would have little levitating bits flying around inside of it, that detected ""threats"" but conveniently didn't mind whole little people just wandering around?  How about the idea that the brain supercomputer thingy would somehow consist of a literal series of tubes, and have power buttons for individual memory bank sections, which were large enough and few enough that Clara could navigate through them?

Then we might get into the actual logistics of this battle.  How are humans ever able to offer *any* meaningful resistance against Daleks?  And why would the Daleks bother invading the ship at all, when they could just blow it out of the sky after locating it?  Why would they care to save one of their own, especially one who was obviously behaving so erratically and damaged enough to get captured in the first place?  And finally, once the one odd Dalek does come out shooting, how is it able to take out an entire invading Dalek force on its own without a single enemy Dalek figuring out what's up and destroying it, using the same weapon tech?  

None of this is on any level even slightly realistic.

true,AluminumFalcon3,lfc12,,"As other people have mentioned Gerrard is being utilized as a deep playmaker than straight DM. His responsibilities include defending, but the main point is that he distributes the ball, helps play it out from back, and has some great passes in him. 

But you could still ask why not play him further up and let him distribute there? That's where I think there's a few things going on. 

Gerrard does not have it in him to play the pressing game we require of most of our midfielders and forwards. His role currently as a ""DM"" is a static one, while the other players surrounding him do more energetic work on and off the ball. Gerrard didn't do as well higher up as he aged because he didn't have the energy to track back, he would be caught high up the pitch, and his declining speed made it harder for him to be incisive and keep possession up the pitch. Playing him deeper, in this static role allows our side to press fluidly and keep Gerrard's stamina up without worrying about our shape getting pulled around too much. However the problem that arises here is that a static defensive role requires great defensive positioning and awareness which is something Stevie still has to and is working on. He is actually a good defender in terms of tackles and dispossessing I would say, but because he slips up on positioning in his static role we suffer at times. Worth it IMO.

This question lands of a few nuances of law. 

The first is capacity to consent. Under the law, people generally have, but can lose, capacity to consent. Once they have lost that capacity, they cannot give their consent to anything. Drunkenness is one way you can lose your capacity to consent, but drunkenness doesn't automatically mean there is no consent. It's a matter of degrees - the more drunk you are, the more likely you are to have lost capacity. 

When it comes to rape, the law accepts that drunk people can consent to sex. People who are too drunk to stand, who are on the verge of losing consciousness can't. If two people are so drunk that they both lack capacity, generally they'll lack the awareness and physical ability to have sex. 

The second is the difference between 'consent' and 'the lack of a reasonable belief in consent'. S1 (1) (C) of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 includes the requirement that '**A does not reasonably believe that B consents**'. That means that even if one, or indeed both, parties are technically unable to consent (lack capacity) then the presence of a reasonable belief in consent negates the lack of consent.  

If two people were drunk and were giving each other a reasonable impression that they consented they would not be committing the offence. Likewise, if one were 'non-capacity' drunk but the other reasonable believed she consented, the sober one would not have committed the offence.",0,1409439247,null,0,false,0,ck4z9gn,t3_2f0n7z,t1_ck4z9gn,t1_ck4y941,null,1427277603,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

true,NotRoryWilliams,null,null,"&gt; I thought it odd though how they took a Dalek seeking to destroy his entire race as ""good"". He said nothing about helping the weak, protecting the innocent or regret for his species's actions - only a wish to destroy the Dalek race. I think this was sloppy writing really. For me, it just screamed ""malfunction"" to me rather than ""morality"". That said, it did serve to display the Doctor's hate for the Daleks - he automatically assumes someone who harbours hate towards the Daleks as ""moral"" and ""good"".

I disagree with your assessment here.

Doc made it quite clear at that moment that he was not satisfied - that wanting to destroy was still not ""good"".  When Rusty had his religious experience at the end, the Doctor plainly expressed that his transference of hate back to the Daleks instead of its original target was not goodness.  Doc doesn't want the Daleks to simply commit suicide as a race - he wants them to be fully redeemed.  

This actually ties back in to the ""Doctor as messiah"" theme that I periodically see expressed and discussed (although it's not very popular around here, as Reddit hates religion).  It's borrowed from Christian theology, the idea that redemption means more than just renouncing evil, but also embracing something better.  The Dalek who is ""saved"" only to go on being hateful, merely changing the object of his hate, is akin to the unsuccessful religious penitent who genuinely tries to embrace the message, but is inherently incapable of grasping it.  The Doctor is of course dissatisfied with this outcome, but realistically, it may be the best he could hope for; perhaps Daleks really are beyond true redemption.  

Suspension of disbelief and oversimplification are essential to scifi/fantasy storytelling, so it's probably silly to get into the broader psychological, sociological, and philosophical implications, but I think it would be fun anyway.  True redemption of the Daleks is probably not possible in a single generation, any more than humans have been able to eradicate racial injustice in a single generation.  To redeem the Daleks, a good first step would be to get them to stop killing everyone else; and as brutal as it would be, a Dalek civil war would be a great way to do that.  It would also be a phenomenal plot arc that, if initiated, could literally last an entire generation of the show.  Perhaps Rusty finds a way to secretly indoctrinate other Daleks with his newfound enlightenment.  It would look like a slow insurrection, or a religious movement.  And perhaps it would spread quickly until reaching a tipping point.  As that happened, there would be periodic flare-ups before the war truly began in earnest; little Dalek terrorist cells taking out chunks of Dalek infrastructure, and engaging in guerrilla warfare before growing strong enough to take on the majority.  

Members of the new Dalek religion would probably find a way to reach out to the Time Lords for help, through the Doctor.  There would be a great plot arc of the Doctor and Rusty (or one of Rusty's disciples) approaching the High Council about forming an alliance between the Time Lords and the New Kaled Republic.  And then we could see Galifrey restored, but with the Doctor agonizing over whether he's done the right thing in essentially renewing the Time War.  

Anyway, I digress; that's the plot points that could happen for the next few seasons if the writers chose to pursue the matter, which I doubt they will.  Sociologically, suppose that the new Daleks (probably best to just call them Kaleds) triumph; what happens next?  We now have a society of self-loathing Kaleds who don't know how to do anything but hate and destroy.  Where would they go from there?  How would they build a society?  Would they become democratic?  Would they learn art?  Would they seek ways to apply their technology for good?  Would a new Kaled philosophy emerge as they strive to learn again what ""goodness"" means?  All of this could be an incredibly exciting set of themes to explore.  

I don't think the writers will go that direction, but I think it would be awesome.  It's probably good fodder for an alternate universe fan fic.  I might just go ahead and write some myself.

But what really stands out is the way this ep and the last have been shot. So cinematic, with longer scenes, longer takes, unusual camera angles - and that ‘piercing the stalk’ moment - reminiscent of Under the Skin, (and the Deep Breath walk last week); so beautiful and eerie - it’s showing what’s possible with televised entertainment which is exciting.

4) Just one would have done the trick, and I find it hard to believe they hadn't found at least one to retrofit into a working super gun that they could pull out and take out every single dalek, one shot each, with far fewer casualties and issues than the guns they were already using. 

5) The only reason they didn't have any effective weapons was because they didn't take Rusty's, which would have helped in several ways.

6) If you're going to reply to that at least have an example, otherwise this will just descend into a ""Yes they do."" ""No they don't."" thing, which would just be childish.

7) Or it shows a massive lapse in character due to poor writing. If you'd like I can find examples from probably every regeneration where the Doctor befriends one or several soldiers, maybe then you'll see that him hating on her for being a soldier makes no sense for the character.

Parents generally consent for their children.  The legal situation is that doctors and parents have to act in the best interests of the child.  This is usually done through good communication and explanation to bring the parents along with you; occasionally that is not possible and in extreme cases the medical team can apply to the court to allow treatment which a judge decides on.

It seems that the medical details are - grade 4 medulloblastoma, neurosurgery to remove the tumour, discussion about ongoing treatment protocol and the balance of chemotherapy vs radiotherapy.  Sadly that tumour has a very poor outcome, spreads fairly easily and often has already spread at the time of diagnosis.  Whole-brain radiotherapy is generally given to kill small tumours that have already spread; it is a pretty devastating treatment but gives the best chance of long term survival.

I don't know much about proton therapy, however it would be unlikely to be useful in this kind of treatment as the whole idea is to prevent spread of tumours you can't see.

true,intangible-tangerine,eng-Bristol,Brizzlefoshizzle,"I would be more inclined to believe his NHS doctors rather than a worried parent who's been reading who-knows-what websites. There's a LOT of pseudo-science and misinformation on the internet. 

You can purchase lots of cancer treatments in the US and other countries which are inappropriate for the particular cancer type or are just not effective at all. 

One of the benefits of having a regulated national health service is that treatments usually need to be proven to be effective before they are approved (we still need to totally phase out pre science-based medicine hang overs like homoeopathy clinics, but much progress has been made on that front.) 

[This article](http://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2014/04/15/modern-healthcare-despite-lack-of-evidence-more-proton-beam-centers-on-the-way)  is on Protean-Beam use for Prostate cancer but it gives an indication of how experimental this treatment is. We must not assume that it's better just because it's more expensive. 

And [This article](http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2013/09/16/proton-therapy-is-coming-to-the-uk-but-what-does-it-mean-for-patients/) from Cancer Research UK cites that just 1 in 100 cancer patients are suited to protean beam therapy and there's a lack of evidence that it is more effective or has less side effects than old-fashioned radiotherapy. 

It also mentions that the NHS has paid for cancer patients to get treatment in the US in the few cases where it has been judged appropriate and for some eye cancers NHS proton-bean therapy is currently available here.

Yes proton-beam therapy is used clinically for some cancers in some patients in some hospitals, but that doesn't mean it's the right answer for this boy's brain tumour as the oncologist stated. 



I don't blame the parents for wanting what they believe is the best treatment, the misinformation on the internet ranges from overstating the benefits and applicability of genuine therapies like proton-beam to out and out scams like  [Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski and his 'antineoplastons'](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/stanislaw-burzynski-antineoplastons-and-the-orphan-drug-sodium-phenyl-butyrate/) where he's been putting cancer patients through very expensive 'experimental' treatments since the 1970s with no indication that they work and with lots of evidence that they can be harmful. 

Just keep in mind if you ever find yourself in a situation where you have to make important choices about your own health or someone else's - there's a lot of misinformation out there and you need to be sceptical and look for what the scientific evidence really says.  

That means controlled trials, not anecdotes or marketing. 

Sites like [Science based medicine](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/) and [bad science](http://www.badscience.net/) have good information, but your first port of call should be your GP and any specialists assigned to you.  

With all that said, /r/atheism jumping to conclusions about the parents just because of their faith was shitty, it looks to me like they have probably been misinformed about the effectiveness of proton-beam therapy for this boy's cancer (I'm assuming the NHS oncologists know more than the websites they've been googling) but that doesn't mean they aren't caring parents, they were clearly trying to do the right thing.

at least i think they should create a hugely evil and dark story for them, especially with how 12 is supposed to be, they could take it into an even deeper realm of evil which would be nice imo.

2) I mean, sure maybe, but if it's apparently good then it shouldn't try to kill them, and if they trust it enough to fix it's wounds then I should think they trust it enough not to shoot them when they take a perfectly reasonable precaution.

As for the theatrics, Doctor Who is a family show with a lot of comedy. Slapstick is a quick way to achieve a funny moment. I don't blame the writer, but the genre there. I equate Strax throwing the newspaper to Donna smacking the Sontaran on the neck and exclaiming ""Back of the neck!"" or the Doctor and Donna talking through a window in sign language while the villain watches.

As for overused monsters, the angels were a mistake in Manhattan. The theory that the Statue of Liberty is an angel is better then seeing it as an angel. On the flip side, I felt today's episode did a good job of making the Dalek's scary for the first time in years.

The club that had stood by him through thick and thin? He tried to force a move to Arsenal, our direct rivals for a top 4 spot and a club that was barely a step up.

It was ludicrous that he would show such a lack of respect to the club. We would quite happily have sold him abroad but the fact was he was bad news and nobody else wanted him. Instead of sitting tight though, trying to right his wrongs and repay the club for their faith he took a great big shit on us from a very great height. That is what I am saying about Suarez, when it didn't suit him to be here he didn't hesitate in looking for the exit and that is why his greatness is tarnished. I have no issue with him going to Barce, we got a decent fee for him and we're probably best rid of him. But to sell him to Arsenal for a measly £40m would have been daylight robbery, not that he gave a shit.

Michael Owen is in the same boat. He did some legendary stuff for us but the lack of respect he showed the club after has cast a shadow over all of that. Owen should be up there with Gerrard and Carragher in terms of modern LFC legends but he isn't.

As others have said, there are undoubtedly 2 sides of the story.  Unfortunately for the doctors he has named in the video, there is no right of reply to his claims.  To do so would be a grave breach of confidentiality so please don't be surprised if the other side to the story is never known.

What strikes me is the breakdown in communication between the hospital (+staff) and the family seen in this case.  Both sides are likely culpable, especially since the parents are determined that their child is going to recover from what may be a very aggressive cancer.

From the video alone - I am concerned regarding the NG feed - NG tubes are fickle beasts and are potentially dangerous since we don't know where the end of the tube is - either in the stomach, or in the lungs (feed into the lungs = v.v.v. bad...)

Problems such as the tube clogging (from improper flushing and care of the tube - or just by being unlucky) necessate removal and reinsertion of a new tube.  In hospitals, national procedure is to try and draw some stomach contents before each feed (or after insertion of a new tube) and test it.  If you can't get any, or the test turns up inconclusive - a Chest X-ray is needed to guarentee that the tube in in the correct position before we start pushing fluids/feed through it...

There's a mythical case that I've heard of whereby someone has regurgitated/coughed their NG tube up, and it then going down the windpipe - all without the postion marker changing - with the change only being caught on a repeat Chest X-Ray.

None of this is obvious to the parents (and who can blame them? Why would you know that as a layperson?)

1) Damage it in a firefight and then transport it back in whatever ship brought their troops back. I don't see how it makes more sense that the dalek would have just been randomnly on the ship that's apparently their base of operations. Maybe they explained why, if they did then I missed it.

3) Did we not spend the whole last episode establishing that he's the same man? I think we did, and I think that means that the most basic tenants of the character survived the regeneration process.

4/5) Well not all of them are in charge of flying the ship surely, so at least some of them could do some retrofitting. If they don't have any engineers on board then I'd say they're pretty fucked next time anything goes wrong with the ship. 

6) I'm still not seeing any examples. I can't agree with vague claims that I can't find justifications for by myself.

Ever midfielder who was once box to box like Gerrard becomes three things; finished at 32/33 because their body can't keep up with their play. Become a CDM like Roy Keane did for United but their career probably won't be that much longer than if they stayed as a box to box player. Or become a deep lying playmaker like Paul Scholes and be able to play at a high level over 35. 

So Rodgers has realised you either mould the team to suit Gerrard's game (luckily he's a fantastic passer) or he should just retire because there's no way he can be as effective as he was from 2005-2009.

Manchester United are going to have to fight to get into the top 10 this year, which will cause their club's value and image to both collapse. They may be able to rebuild, but the disfunction of the club has been showcased on virtually every level (owners, manager, players, fans, etc), and it seems insurmountable for them to escape it, at least for the next few years. 

Liverpool are going to have a fine season this year, playing good, high pressing, attacking football. What this season is going to be seen as a few years from now will be the foundation of a dynasty being built. Markovic, Can, Balotelli, Moreno, Manquillo, and others will find this adjustment period to be difficult, but if the team makes it into the top 4 this year, then the foundation will have been properly laid, and anything will be possible over the next 10 years.

I *don't* think people should be prosecuted for expressing their opinions, no matter how bigoted, but I do think that if and when people accost others in the street with those opinions that it can become harassment.

But I think you're essentially right.  Bad speech is an *unavoidable* side effect of allowing free speech, but the potential harm that bad speech does is outweighed by the benefits of allowing anyone to express any opinion or  criticize any idea, no matter how sacrosanct.  Yes it's horrible to have racists rant on the internet, but it's far more dangerous to place ideologies above questioning.

true,jaded_gal05,null,null,"I'm torn too. I live in a HUGE SEC state, home of the biggest, most bitter rivalry in college football...but I love Doctor Who. 

And the SEC. Auburn specifically, so ideally I don't want to miss the original broadcast of either in my area. It wouldn't have been an issue today, the Auburn vs Arkansas game SHOULD have been over by now but was delayed due to lightning from the storms on The Plains. 

9:55 left in the 4th, auburn 38 arkansas 21 when they stopped game play. It starts again at 7:20, a mere 40 minutes BEFORE DOCTOR WHO STARTS!!!!

As to this being a ""circlejerky"" post, your entitled to think so. But if you reside in certain areas of the US College Football is like religion. Rivalries are born on the playing field, allegiances designated when we leave the womb. And those allegiances last FOR LIFE. No matter where I live I will ALWAYS be an Auburn Tiger. I guess you need to live in an SEC state, if you don't, you wouldn't get it, if you do, football is HUGE. It's a matter of state pride. In Alabama, where I live, we have won more SEC Championships, a total of 31 between Alabama &amp; Auburn, with a combined total of 17 National Championship wins. That 19 more SEC championships than the next highest state in the SEC &amp; 11 more combined National Championships than any other state. 

People may think the South is full of nothing but rednecks, however that's not true. Engineers in Alabama played a crucial role in sending the 1st man to the moon. In the 60's. No Lie. So yeah, back then we weren't barefoot rednecks either. Don't believe me? Google it. 

And it just so happens, in Alabama we also know how to play some god damn football. So I get where the OP is coming from...choosing something besides SEC play is akin to blasphemy depending on where you live. 

I'm going to DVR DW, but I still prefer watching the 1st broadcast:( 

Damn lightning. 

But still....

true,Jamaicaman90,swans1995,1912,"**Looking back:**

* I think we all expected Siggy to do a job coming back. However, I don't think anyone expected *this* much of an impact so far. I remembered him for being a goalscorer. What I wasn't really thinking as much is that he'd be a creative powerhouse. Literally everything is coming from him at the moment. Michu who?

* Bony hasn't scored yet. That's not *too* concerning, because he's getting in all the right places; he doesn't look like he's lost his ability, just that he's swiping at them a bit too enthusiastically at the moment, perhaps just eager to get the first one in. It's also worth noting that he was unlucky not to get a penalty today from the indirect free kick block. I stupidly missed MOTD so I can't say for certain but from where I was stood it looked like a fair shout. The great thing is that so far we've been able to afford a dry run, and he can work on it without pressure and with even the most fickle fan's support.

* We've put out the same team in all three league games, and our bench is fairly stacked. Fernández, Montero and Gomis especially are certainly first XI quality, but it's actually difficult to justify putting them in right now because the players we are picking are doing admirably. Britton will eventually be fit again as well, who is always in with a shout.

* On the subject of Montero, he is, to quote a famous manager gaffe, 'raping' fullbacks when he comes onto the pitch. The stats won't back it up but he deserved at least two assists from crosses from his time on the pitch today.

* Fabianski hasn't had a massive test yet, but he fills me with more confidence than Vorm did last year. He has been absolutely textbook so far, and I think part of the reason that we've only conceded a goal, other than a great defence, has been that he has commanded his box perfectly.

**Going forward:**

* Looking at Manchester United and Everton, I want us to finish at least 7th this year. It might be early days but I honestly think we've already done enough for safety, in terms of the fact that we don't even need a point per game from here to get the magic 40. Top 7 might be pushing it, but I think this year is the best opportunity to do so. While we haven't actually done it yet, I can't help but think the 'best of the rest' finish (8th) is a bit hollow, because in all honesty there's not much in it between 8th and 14th, and to be honest other than getting relegated all of those positions are a bit... hollow.

* The cups. Carrying on from the above point, there is something I'd value more than breaking the top 7: a trophy. We aren't going to win the league (Chelsea will pip us on goal difference), but I think we're more than capable of putting up a fight for the two cups this year, on the basis that I think we've got our strongest overall squad we've had and have already taken a lot of league pressure off ourselves. I don't buy this 'league is everything' crap. Let's win a fucking title that we can talk about for years to come and get back into Europe as well.

This is all extremely optimistic, but I think we're looking at the best Swansea team in our century of history. Even if we've been lucky in playing teams at the right time, the fact is we've made a massive dent in our initial league target and confidence is sky high. I wouldn't expect any malaise - the players may well be thinking the same things too.

Change to a 4-1-2-1-2 and you basically sacrifice that width for a central playmaker and a second option up front, as well as leaving fullbacks exposed. It just doesn't make sense to me.

I'm not saying it can't work, I just don't see why we'd spend 8m on Cleverley considering the current players and system. I'd get it if it was a lower fee (like Cole for free) but in our current state that kind of money on a player that doesn't seem to fit just doesn't sit right, you know?

That part actually felt consistent to me. I mean, yeah - a genuinely lethal and ruthless fighting force motivated by pure evil wouldn't hesitate, but the idea of a Dalek acting contrary to *the way a Dalek is supposed to act* has always been utterly horrifying and shockingly perverse to Daleks. They were stunned for long enough that Rusty could take them all out.

I agree with all your points, and I can let them slide to a certain degree. This episode gets a pass, but it's not a *great* episode.

One thing that bothers me is the *context* here. Ever since ""The Asylum Of The Daleks"", the state of the Dalek regime has been in question.

Prior to that, they were constantly trying to re-assert themselves - lost factions and splinter groups in ragtag groups, scattered by the time war, trying to rebuild the Dalek empire.

But now they seem established. The have a parliament. Skaaro is somehow restored (I suppose ""The Day Of The Doctor"" somewhat ameliorates that - though you'd think he'd have noticed that everything touched by the Time War was *not* time-locked), though abandoned.

So, was ""Victory Of The Daleks"" supposed to be the restoration of the Daleks as a great force in the universe?

And who were these humans on the Aristotle? They called themselves rebels. Rebelling against what? Daleks don't oppress, they *exterminate*, absent some ulterior motive for keeping people alive.

They really have felt like this flexible foe - pop them into a story without any wider context, and just twist them this way and that without any qualifying plot.

Actually, so have the Cybermen lately, though at least they're a tad more consistent.",0,1409446825,null,0,false,0,ck52ba4,t3_2f113q,t1_ck52ba4,t1_ck4yvm2,null,1427276180,61,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,61

1. You shouldn't get annoyed/sarcastic when I'm asking you a legitimate question in a friendly environment. (Also, down votes? Really?)

2. It's a legitimate question because there are infinitely many ways to convey the same idea. You can use any number of constructions to indicate that Naismith shot and Courtois saved. I'm asking what preposition you would use in the construction you're criticizing, and then you're giving me a different construction, thereby not answering my question. I'd think this was clear to someone who feels secure enough in their knowledge of grammar to criticize others.

3. More generally: my wife is British. I live in England. I watch football on British television. I was asking you because I honestly can't think of what would be said here, and even after years of this, I still find such subtle differences interesting.

4. Since we seem to be confrontational now, you shouldn't presume to teach others their native language because, as a wise 20 year-old, you know yours is the only acceptable dialect.

Clara said the doctor had gone to get coffee three (six?) weeks ago. So she's drinking...weeks old coffee? 

I loved the Doctor lampshading the Body Wars/Honey I Shrunk the Kids plot. ""Bad idea for a proctologist.""

I think Danny Pink is already awesome. I can't wait to see more of him.

I think I remember somebody (maybe the Doctor) actually tapping the glass in the eyestalk at some point. So that's just gone? I mean it looked cool, but it made me think.

A lot of people are saying the episode reminded them of Dalek. Which it did! But it also reminded me of Let's Kill Hitler, with the nano-shrinking and the antibodies (sadly these didn't warn their victims about the tingling sensation preceding death).

That said, I'm trying really hard to like the 12th Doctor. Nothing against Capaldi, whom I think is a great actor and he's really giving it his all. I don't know exactly where the problem lies, but it seems like something crucial to the Doctor is just gone.
