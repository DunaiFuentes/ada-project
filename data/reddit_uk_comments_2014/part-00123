I mean compare Scotlands performance last year to this year and there's been pretty dramatic changes (though they're obviously still the strongest region, but not by the same margin).

Likewise if you went back a few more years you'd find the West region doing really well (Exeter were really strong 2009-2010 for example) but only scraped into Div 2 this year.

I think the important thing is that the top 8 teams in the country make it through, after that if it remains in a tournament format rather than a league you're going to struggle to get an effective ranking outside of the top 4.

For example if a teams knocked out at the quarter finals by the eventual winners, does that mean they should be forced into a maximum of 5th place? Definitely not.

true,epicJoeShow,esl,ESL UK Tournament Admin,"Thought i'd just wack a quick post here. It's super tough getting into casting and it's definitely something that if your intent on doing it then be prepared for an uphill fight. 

By all means this isn't too put you off. I personally am all for new people to help showcase the UKDota talent but it takes work to get to where you want to be. As some people have touched on before it's not just about Casting loads of games. Part of my (very minor) success involved alot of volunteer work and just being trustworthy.  

For example just a small selection of the volunteer roles that I do within the gaming industry:  
. epic.LAN host / video guy / event team / minion / radio - Have done this for going on 4 years now.  
. Admin for Dota2 at ESL.UK  
. Radio host at Hive365 (Gaming Radio)   

Plus various other roles and stuff.  

The next part is luck.  

For i50 durka mentioned he didn't have a co-caster for the event. So I offered my services and volunteered to do that. This was my big break for me. Managed to get a small following within the UK Dota community. 

So as a TLDR for this. Think about the bigger picture as well. It's not just casting loads of games (Though practice is very important) but also everything that goes with it.  

From that just a few tips which helped me along.  
* Don't be weird  
* Be available (You may have to make sacrifices sometimes)  
* Respect those who help you
* Be mutual on all UK Dota politics (Otherwise the Autism will take over your mind)  

That's it from me for now.

Around 15% of the population of Brighton is gay, and there's an active LGBT scene at Sussex. Plenty of music going on in the city, with gigs most nights. http://www.resident-music.com/tickets is probably your best list.

There is an art house cinema in Brighton with three screens split over two venues. One of which is the oldest cinema in the country. http://www.brightonculture.co.uk/cinema-in-brighton/. There are two more cinemas in the city, but why would you go to them.

There's around 325 pubs in the city. Tonnes of coffee shops, many of them independent. There's a rock climbing place in Worthing, which is 20-30 minutes by train. There's sea kayaking, but a lack of rivers or lakes limits non-sea kayaking. You have the south downs for hiking and mountain biking. 

I presume you're doing your masters at IDS? My girlfriend graduated from there last year, so I'll point her at this thread for some IR specific information if you want.

Criminals will always be anti, that's a fact of life.  People also increasingly don't like to be told they're out of line and increasingly refuse to accept that their actions may sometimes have consequences.

Where my faith in the Police falters a little is where rank is concerned.  As a rule, albeit not 100% of course, those 'ambitious' ones on the promotion trail don't share the same admirable sense of public service or desire to help others.  These individuals' decisions often hamper the Constables' ability to do their jobs and are responsible for the bureaucracy that is often reported.

I know why they didn't, and that they made the decision well before 1819. TJ deciding not to is therefore pretty cool in my opinion, but doesn't reflect negatively on those other institutions.

Also, the way I understand it the UVA honor code has nothing to do with Jefferson. It's a completely student-run system initiated later on in the school's history (1842, TJ died in 1826).

I'm pretty sure that most members of the IRA believed they were fighting a just war for the freedom of their country. You can say they were wrong, but labelling them terrorist scumbags is even more simplistic.

You consider yourself an intelligent, thoughtful bloke, I'm sure, so you should have mind to the injustices that occurred in Ireland, at British hands, to the parents and grandparents of IRA members.

The peace process is the way to resolution, not breaking into peoples' homes and dragging them from their beds in the middle of the night.

I have no issue holding my hands up and saying on the night we were beaten by a better team. There are certainly ""what-ifs"" but thats football.
The one area where I think we have disappointed is in the league, we should have won it given the teams that cost us points.

As a club we have seen a lot of younger players bed into the team and gain more experience. We have bought in Matic, who has been an absolute beast and a player we certainly missed in the CL. 

We have a summer ahead during which I expect to see Jose really mold the team into one that will have no excuses for an empty trophy cabinet next season. I think we'll see a number of older and fringe players being sold or leaving on free's and potentially see some loanees return and push for positions in the first team (Courtois/Lukaku) In addition we'll add what we have missed this entire season, a world class striker. I would think that if we had a world class striker playing, we'd have won the league this year.....
Anyway, its been a great season, can't believe its almost over already!

true,APeanut,null,null,"Of course its been obvious for a while that we will get a striker in this coming summer.  Who we keep, and if we bring Lukaku back is another question in its own right that depends on the actions of our current players.  Torres looks to be staying, Eto'o and Ba have been rumored to leave.  That being said if we were to sell Lukaku for extra funds is a decent question.  Maybe bring in someone like Bony to backup Diego Costa, Cavanni, or Ballotelli.  

Our next question is a CM player to pair along with Matic.  While Luiz has been a great player in big games defensively, I personally think we are in need of a player who has a better passing ability.  Someone who has a similar style to Xabi Alonso, Toni Kroos, etc.  We are looking into William Carvalho as we speak, I would enjoy to see Kroos, Pirlo, Paulinho.  

Last problem that I believe also leads to our lack of goals that may be unpopular.  Ivaonovic.  He simply does not have the attacking presence that need for our RB.  It is time that we switch Dave back to his original posistion and look for a left footed player to play on the left side rather than handicapping Dave.  Fabio Coentrao, Moreno, Shaw, or possibly just keeping Cole if he can find his old form. 

Finally our goalkeeping posistion.  It's a good problem to have but we have two world class goalkeepers.  I say we keep Cech until he breaks the record of most clean sheets in the Premier league, and we sell him for around 10-15 million.  From then on, Cech always will be remembered as a legend and we can send him on his way because its time for Courtious.

I've said this in other posts about Lallana, but he's nowhere near Sterling or Coutinho and he's years older. He looks impressive for a midtable team because he has free reign in their side. He wouldn't have that kind of freedom there, and I think a lot of you would be absolutely shocked if you got a chance to see what a player like Coutinho could do in an average side that let him run. 

And I see people talking about work rates, but I don't think you understand what you're talking about. He doesn't fight to win the ball back as soon as it's lost. Not a requisite in any other side, but look at how fiercely Rodgers has Coutinho battling to disrupt play on the defensive side of the ball. Lallana just doesn't do that. 

We'd be infinitely better off spending the money it would take to bring him in elsewhere. For that kind of money we could bring in a player that will instantly improve the first 11. 

Like I've said before, I'll support him if he's wearing our shirt next season, but I honestly cannot see that happening and think we'll be better off for it.

true,buried_treasure,null,null,"The majority of Muslims in the UK are descendants of families who immigrated here in the 1960s and early 70s. So it's not a new thing at all.

However ever since 9/11 and America's famous ""War on Terrorism"" a lot of Muslims (all over the world) have felt that their religion is being targetted, both militarily and socially. Whether that's true or not is irrelevant (and an argument for a different thread), what's important is that many Muslims feel that's the case.

People who feel that their religion or lifestyle is under threat usually respond in one of two ways: some try to hide the fact that they're a member of that group and attempt to assimilate completely into the wider culture. Others will fight back by making themselves more visible and asserting their identity more strongly than they did before.

So although the number of Muslims hasn't significantly increased in the last 15 years, their visibility has.  If you go to any UK university and talk to any of their female students wearing a hijab, you'll find they're generally intelligent, educated women brought up with the same British values as their peers, and are wearing the hijab not because some dominating and controlling father or husband has forced them to do so, but out of choice because it's a way of showing defiance to ""the man"". Before 9/11 these very same women would probably have not worn a headscarf, today they do and therefore their visibility as ""different"" is greatly increased.

As for companies accommodating Muslims in the food they sell etc, well that's those companies' choice to do so or not to do so. If they don't, they'll be ignoring a sizeable minority of the population which could well be a foolish commercial decision.

How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries! Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. The effects are apparent in many countries. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property – either as a child, a wife, or a concubine – must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men. Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the faith: all know how to die but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science, the science against which it had vainly struggled, the civilisation of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilisation of ancient Rome.

&gt; I was shocked that Channel 4 TV was airing the 'call to prayer' and showing documentaries about white Muslim converts to Islam

That isn't something that is done regularly, it was part of a season on Islam that Channel 4 was doing over Ramadan last year. 

&gt;Everyday, I see some news article about some big brand changing their usual ways to accommodate Muslims (Subway, Lloyds, M&amp;S), I see news stories about school children being forced to attend mosques for ""diversity"" training, school staff being fired for serving pork at the cafeteria, and endless other examples.

Stop getting your news from the Daily Mail and reddit. Yes, where there is a significant moslem population efforts are made to accomodate them, why shouldn't there be.

Just to address it for a second though, common-or-garden centrists (under which head I would include Labour supporters) generally don't object to rational and logical controls on immigration per se, although they may see a party basing its platform around it as indulging in dog-whistle politics for members of the community who are.  Indeed, Labour don't advocate uncontrolled immigration, none of the major parties do.  Genuine leftists are, by definition, internationalists, and believe the pressures which cause 'excessive' immigration are structured and economic factors, and a fundamental feature of modern global capitalism and Western foreign policy, as well as a hangover from imperialism, and that it is this system which needs to change rather than dividing the working class against itself on the basis of arbitrary nation States and blaming the less powerful and more exploited parts of it for their own exploitation and the individual solutions to this that they seek.

The right tends to support globalisation insofar as it benefits corporations, but to be ambivalent about its impact on working people.  Disciplining wages can be effected by free movement of people, they argue that this improves the efficiency of markets also, but they don't want to pay the increases to existing costs in terms of social welfare, public services, etc. and would rather see these over-extended and run down to heighten the discipline.

Third, terrorists used the situation for cold-blooded murder. Someone piss you off in the pub? Shoot them in the back of the head? Mother lost her job? Shoot the manager in the back of the head. Petty revenge and mini-hitlerism, but with a very fucking high body count.

Fourth, classify whoever the fuck you want as a 'combatant'. Hey, that postman essentially works for the evil British government right? Shoot the fucker in the back of the head. And for extra lulz, do it in front of his wife and young kids.

Fifth, having trouble recruiting for your universally loved freedom fight? That's OK. Just take a leaf from the book of Scientology and groom the socially excluded, abused, disaffected, emotionally vulnerable et-fucking-cetera and teach them how to fire armalites and build bombs. This really raises their life chances while teaching them a trade. Top fucking work.

Sixth, demonstrate how much you really care about your 'cause' by collaborating with enemy paramilitaries in the dividing up of towns and cities for 'business' purposes such as blackmail, extortion and protection money.

And it's okay if people don't want to pay, just crucify them by nailing them to the road. Or knee-capping them with your side-arm. Or if they still won't comply, shoot them (or a family member) in the back of the head. Doesn't matter if they're catholic just like you, they need to learn their fucking place. And that is doing whatever the fuck you tell them to do.

And when we've extorted the cash, hopefully no-one will notice that our generals are living the fucking high life with large stacks of cash, while we make people shit themselves so much that they daren't even stand at a fucking bus stop without worrying about a drive-by machine gunning.

Megrahi was released so that US and UK oil companies could acquire lucrative contracts with the Gaddafi regime. Megrahi's release proves my point; at Washington, the oil lobby is more organised and powerful than a group of victims families, and the same is true of the Irish lobby (although not to the same extent, of course).

In spite of the general opinion around here that Irish-Americans (and indeed the Irish diaspora as a whole) have a foreign and misguided view of Ireland etc, the fact remains that [the Irish have been and continue to be well-represented in positions of power at all state and government levels in the USA.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_American#Irish_Americans_in_politics_and_government)

I know that Thatcher's hand in the Anglo-Irish agreement was moved by Reagan who was under pressure from the Irish lobby to see an ""agreement"" made - and the role of US diplomats since the peace process trying to broker agreements on a little island which would otherwise have no clear interest to the USA is also evidence of the Irish lobby at work, in my opinion.

Rightly or wrongly, the people who pushed for Gerry Adams to get a US visa in the face of high-level opposition from Britain, are not going to be best pleased that their man is now being prosecuted, and I'm sure that if nothing else, they will push the pressure from the US to sign up to the Haass proposals on the past at least.",1,1398928984,null,0,1398944099,0,ch6ps08,t3_24e8ex,t1_ch6ps08,t1_ch6dkmc,null,1433601786,0,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,0

It has been both controversial and interesting into the fact that Liverpool is doing extremely well, especially after the mishap with the failed transfer, and that's why there has been so much pressure and speculation at the fact a top performer at another English Premier League side could potentially make a move to Liverpool.

[Emphasis mine]

Yes, and other people think that the role the state should have in this regulation should be smaller. 

&gt; Bigotry in the form you have described is the act of taking away rights from people in the public sphere. It was evil when it existed in the 1950s and 1960s - it is evil now.

Holy shit, **I KNOW**. I agree! There's absolutely no point continually saying it's a bad thing because (and this was the start of the sodding argument) *that's not where people disagree*.

&gt; Not if they have no control over their loudness. You would have to assume they have agency.

No you don't, you can if you can show it's affecting your business. 

&gt; &gt; You can also fire/not hire someone if they wear a niqab if it gets in the way of the job (like teaching people a language)

&gt; This one is a being argued. However, teaching someone language isn't that condition, the case is made about identity and safety. Again - it's something that has to be a balance of harms. See above. ~

&gt; &gt;but you can refuse to hire an actor that's black for the role of a KKK member in a film or refuse to hire someone in a wheelchair as a bricklayer.

&gt; Again these are interesting tests, the first one would be a very close thing and you could argue it either way, the second would be again under the harm principle.

No, these are tested cases, you don't seem to understand the law here, it has nothing to do with harm. It's to do with your ability to effectively do the job. However, that's still irrelevant to the point but may be important to know if you're involved in hiring.

&gt; The balance is how much your rights, the rights of others and the rights of collective society can achieve. In this balancing act it is just as important to have freedom to exercise your right something but equally as important to have freedom from people trying to take away yours = especially in the public sphere

It's probably going to be for questioning and nothing else. I think a conviction (at least, of Adams) isn't a realistic prospect.

1) It's Gerry Adams, one of the slippiest of a rather slippery lot. And he has damn good lawyers. Is the word of one woman in an interview that was not given under oath or caution going to hold up in court? There will need to be some seriously solid evidence to secure a conviction.

2) Politics will come into play. And Sinn Fein are masters of politics. They'll extract as high a price as possible if they follow through with any conviction. 

Is it someone else playing politics and trying to apply pressure to SF? If so, I think they're going to get their ass handed to them, especially after recent missteps by the UK government. Massacres of civilians by state forces being brushed aside by the secretary of state while so much effort seems to be being spent on trying to pin Adams on a murder that he probably didn't directly commit (even if he ordered it). Whats happened to all those convictions of Loyalist terrorists that was apparently on the cards from the Historical Enquiries team?

They convict Adams, they'll play this card, play it well, and turn it into votes and concessions. 

None of this is to say that there shouldn't be investigations or convictions over this murder - but Adams was not one of the people who dragged that lady from her door, nor was he one of the ones to bury her, and may not even know exactly who carried out the order even if that order did originate from him.

I was refuting the argument the guy above was making. He said the tapes could have lead to more convictions, which is ridiculous considering the terms of the tapes. You can't convict dead people, as far as I'm aware. 

&gt;And that's why the privacy of those interviews should have been respected - we can't bring those kids' mother back, but if we find better resolution processes for conflicts, then we'll save far more lives in the future.

This assumes the tapes will actually be deleted, which I somehow doubt. Boston College is just using that threat to try and win points. 

&gt;I'm pretty sure that most members of the IRA believed they were fighting a just war for the freedom of their country. You can say they were wrong, but labelling them terrorist scumbags is even more simplistic.

Well it's a good thing I never labelled them terrorist scumbags then, isn't it? I'll go on record as saying they were at a minimum, murderous scumbags.

&gt;How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries! Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. The effects are apparent in many countries. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property – either as a child, a wife, or a concubine – must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men. Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the faith: all know how to die but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science, the science against which it had vainly struggled, the civilisation of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilisation of ancient Rome.

I can understand why I'd be seen as suspicious, but the Met's reaction was completely out of line; they acted as if they'd already seen me commit an offence, and were determined to turn the stop into an arrest by any means short of outright lying.

Hampshire police (both in a student area in Portsmouth and a quiet residential area of Petersfield) started from the same set of assumptions about me, but apologised when they realised they'd misjudged me. Like the Met, they stopped me with a shout of ""POLICE! Stop right there!"". Unlike the Met, when I stopped immediately, turned to face them and waited, they cooled off, chatted to me, then apologised.

Durham police got it completely right; they came up to me, and said ""Hello"". As they were uniformed officers, I stopped and responded politely - something like ""Good evening, what can I do for you?"" They then went down the chat route, and let me on my way.

As for the idea of 3 year contracts with a cap on rent rises throughout it has the same flaw as the Energy price cap in the Landlords will just set their initial rate higher based on where they expect the market to be in 3 years time. Also a contract which can be broken by the tenet for any reason but can't be by the Landlord except for breech of contract (which I assume they would have to be able to prove in case the tenant takes them to court) seems deeply unfair.

A lot of platforms have the well area as a separate bridge linked platform, so its events on the processing platform you have to worry about generally, which you could argue are comparable to the risks of working on an onshore installation (but with less options for running away from an event).

I think the biggest complaint is that its pretty dull when you're off shift. UK oil platforms aren't kitted out particularly well, especially when compared to the Norwegian ones.

You should understand that I'm not saying that its uniformly perfect, just better than pretty much every where else.

To give you some anecdotal examples, during the riots in 2011, the Met were:

a) So soft in their approach that they were criticised by the public for not cracking down enough.

b) When the newspaper seller was pushed and subsequently died, the officer was dismissed for gross misconduct. A trial actually happened and the family accepted a payout for what the met admitted was ""excessive force and unlawful force"".

By comparison, I remember in Italy during the G8 protests in 2001. A protestor was shot dead, then subsequently run over by police, he may still have been alive when run over.

A complaint and trial happened, noone was dismissed. There was a trial for the man accused Mario Placanica, he claimed that he was being used as a scapegoat. He died in what some called a ""suspicious"" car accident after complaining of someone tampering with his car. His parents were barred from visiting him in the hospital.

The Italian press reported in my opinion somewhat nonchalently on the case. The British press however made it front page news and were pushing for answers, as they are far more hungry for scandal.


It would be boring to list hundreds of anecdotal evidence, but I know for a fact that the British police are far less corrupt and do a pretty brilliant job. And they don't even have guns.

Yet everyone seems to smoke because 'it relaxes them' , bullshit you started smoking to be cool and then after a year of smoking realized you were addicted and couldn't give up the cancer sticks, so now you smoke 'to relax or be social'.

I'm curious, because the scale is one I've seen used to determine where the line actually falls for someone, and I'm confident you'd come somewhere in the high numbered ranges. There are a few assumptions you have to bear in mind:

 * For offensive things, read ""things that are so upsetting to you personally that they'd enrage you to the point of wanting to physically assault someone"".
 * Assume that I'm physically much stronger than you, so that I'd win any fight, and you wouldn't be able to break free if I got a grip on you.
 * Assume also that you can't drown out my voice if you can hear me at all.
 * Assume that you don't live with me, or associate with me at all, outside of the scenario described.

 1. I'm in my home, inaudible from outside, saying offensive things. If you leave my home, you stop hearing me.
 2. I'm in my home, with the door open, saying offensive things that you can hear when you walk past my door.
 3. I'm on the pavement outside my home, saying offensive things that you can hear as you walk down my street.
 4. I'm following you (no physical contact, no trespass), saying offensive things. You can get away from me by walking to somewhere I'm not allowed to enter (e.g. your home).
 5. I'm obstructing your path (again, no physical contact, no trespass), saying offensive things. You can't get away from me, as I won't let you go anywhere.
 6. I'm holding you still while I say offensive things. You can't move away from me.

All 6 of these are things where prohibiting them is an infringement of my right to free speech to some degree or other. 

Anyone who objects to item 1 on the list inherently objects to free speech, as you could easily simply not come into my home (or leave if you've come in) and thus not be exposed to my speech.

Equally, anyone who doesn't object to number 6 is taking a hard line in favour of free speech, as you're saying that my right to speech overrules your right to not be assaulted by me.

true,BuboTitan,null,null,"Interview with Paul Weston transcript:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQzV_-latew

Q:	 	Where exactly were you speaking, please?
 
A:	 	Winchester, which is in the county of Hampshire, and Hampshire is part of the South-East constituency for the European Union elections which I’m standing in. So I thought: “As it’s part of my constituency, I will go down and try and explain to these people, who do not live nearby to a Muslim community, something about Islam to them.”
 
Q:	 	You were actually speaking to a crowd about standing as a candidate in an election in a riding in which you were one of the candidates. How many people would you say were listening to you?
 
A:	 	Well, in the beginning — you know, let’s face it: none of this lasted for very long, I’m afraid. We had — I started off by saying to them, that “People of Winchester, I want to talk to you specifically about Islam, and I want to read something to you.” And then I started reading it.
We were immediately interrupted by this woman, who then immediately got on her phone, and we rightly assumed she had phoned the police. And within about three minutes the police had arrived and taken my megaphone away from me and taken my transcript of Churchill’s words, and said that I could no longer do that, because my words were causing offence and distress to people who were listening.
 

Q:	 	Did your audience or the police know at the time you were quoting Churchill? Or did they know afterward? At what point did they know it was Churchill you were quoting? Did you start out by saying that this is Winston Churchill, or were you saving that for the end of the quote?
 
A:	 	Well, no; I was never actually going to mention it at all. If I hadn’t been arrested, I would have mentioned it was Winston Churchill. Having been arrested, I thought, “There’s absolutely no point informing the police about this, because they will then perhaps be slightly less forward in taking action.”
And I thought that, “If it really has come to the point that you can be arrested for saying these words, then don’t tell them who originally said it, and let them prosecute you — arrest you, prosecute you — and just to show the rest of the world how utterly sunk this poor old country of Britain is today.”
 

Q:	 	Interesting; I agree with that. Among the people that were there when you started, did you have any supporters? That were listening?
 
A:	 	We did. We had — you know, there were — we got passers-by initially, and a small crowd formed, but this was literally all over within three minutes. And by the time it ended, we had people shouting from the crowd, “What are you arresting him for? There’s nothing wrong with what he’s saying!” Which was probably about 80% of the people, with that view.
And the 20%, of course, were shouting things like, “You’re a bunch of Nazis,” and, you know, the usual stuff that either the hard Left, or the totally uninformed about Islam, come out with.
 

Q:	 	What is the charge that you believe is going to be levelled at you?
 
A:	 	Well, in the beginning, they said to me that, because my words were causing concern and distress, I should immediately cease. When I said that I wasn’t going to do that, they said, “If you don’t cease, we will arrest you under something called a ‘breach of the Section 27 Dispersal Notice’.”
And I said, “Well, that’s fine, but I am standing for an election in this constituency. I have the right to free speech. I will continue speaking.” I picked up the megaphone again; I think I got about two words out, and that was it. I was manhandled down the steps, and then searched and chucked into the back of their police van.

When we got to the police station, I wasn’t fingerprinted, my DNA wasn’t taken, because a Section 27 is not necessarily a criminal offence. So they said, “We’re not going to fingerprint and DNA you.”

They put me into a cell, and they kept me there, I think, for about five hours, and then a policeman came in and said, “We’re dropping the original thing” — which was this Section 27 breach — “We are re-arresting you in the police station now under the ‘incitement of racial hatred’”, and specifically they are getting me with “racially aggravated crime under Section 4 of the Public Order Act.” Which I’ve had a look at, and it’s rather nasty: it says that you can go to gaol for two years under that one.
 

Q:	 	Major media in the UK: has there been any interest in this? Any requests for interviews by BBC, or even The Daily Mail, or anything?
 
A:	 	No, there has been absolutely nothing. I got a phone call earlier from The Southampton Echo, which also covers the Winchester area, and I — Well, I didn’t get a phone call, I got a message saying, can I phone the journalist. And I was expecting an antagonistic bloke, and that’s exactly what I got.
He was not horrified about the idea you can be arrested for quoting Churchill in Britain today. He wanted to know why I did it, what I thought I would achieve, was I aware that by doing that I would be causing offence and distress, and all the buzzwords they come out with.

So that’s the only British media outlet that has come anywhere near me. And it was immediately antagonistic. Apart from that, there has been nothing.
 

Q:	 	What would you say that the attitude of the police was that were dealing with you? Both in the police station, and the initial arrest? Did you get any sense of their view of this?
 
A:	 	Well, the two policemen that initially arrested me were very young. They didn’t really have the faintest idea what was going on. It was only when I got to the police station that that was then dropped, and a senior policeman then brought in the charges of racially aggravated crime. But, despite that, they were — I can understand they’re following orders. The actual policemen themselves were very polite, very civilised.
One of them even talked to me for half an hour after the interview, because I had a taped interview in the interview room, and I was supposed to go back to the cells, and he said, “Look, we’re going to arrange bail for you. You don’t need to go back to the cell. We can sit in here and have a cup of coffee and a sandwich and have a chat off the record.” And, off the record, he said to me that, “We are essentially at war in this country, but of course I’m not in my official capacity allowed to say anything about that.”
 

Q:	 	What would you like to see happen? What do you expect to happen next? There’s going to be a trial, then? Like, you’ve been formally charged. Or, at least you’re going to be formally charged. Do you know anything about when there will be a trial?
 
A:	 	Well, the — I’ve been bailed for three weeks. I’m due to go back to the police station on May the 24th. And I am assuming that, in the interim period — what the investigating officer said to me at the time was, he will forward everything, including the — obviously, because they don’t have video of me doing it. They are just responding to a report from the crowd; they heard a few words that I said. But what they have said, they have taken a copy of the Churchill transcript, and they are sending that on to the Crown Prosecution Service with the recommendation that I be prosecuted under this racially aggravated Section 4.
So somewhere between now and May the 24th, if the Crown Prosecution Service says, “Yes, we’re going to go ahead and prosecute him,” then I’m assuming that when I go back to the police station on May the 24th I will be arrested and held.
 

Q:	 	So, for the benefit of people that don’t live in the UK, what level of court, and meaning of court — the court system is a little different than it is either in Canada or the States. This would be in front of a magistrate or a judge? This is a criminal proceeding, right?
 
A:	 	It’s a criminal proceeding, but criminal proceedings can be dealt with in magistrates’ courts. But I would imagine, because clearly, if they are intending to prosecute, then we are obviously going to mount a proper defence, so it would probably go to a Crown court hearing with a judge, which is similar to — I’m sure you heard about the whole Tim Burton “taqiyya” trial recently, and of course Tim got off on that one, and the Crown Prosecution Service must have been aware that he was probably going to get off, but they are — you know, the Crown Prosecution Service was taken over by the cultural Marxist Left a long time ago, twenty years ago now.
They will prosecute anything they possibly can, even if they know they’re going to lose it, simply because they think that by prosecuting, they will deter anybody else from doing it, even if they win in court; they still don’t want to have to go through that pretty unpleasant situation, especially when the power they have on their side is the fact that if you are found guilty, the sentence is two years.
 

Q:	 	Is there anything that people both inside or outside the UK could do to help you? Are you fundraising, or do you just want to raise awareness of this? Or what is it that you would like to see people do?
 
A:	 	Well, I think at the moment it’s just to raise awareness, because I know that — I always knew before this happened that the probability of my being arrested was very high, and the probability of the English, British media taking any interest in it was very low. And I thought that, this is where we need — and thank God they exist — a country, America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, where you can actually still say these things and get away with it. And my initial thought was, if we can get this into — I mean, for example, I think I’ll be with Michael Coren next week, and Erick Stakelbeck is trying to organise something for Fox News and Glenn Beck. So if we can make it big enough in America, that the media over here are simply forced into having to report it, then that would basically satisfy every single reason for why I did this in the first place.",0,1398942748,null,0,false,0,ch6rz39,t3_24fhr2,t1_ch6rz39,t3_24fhr2,null,1433602821,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

* ""I want to go to rehab"" - average person has to wait a long time, continueing to suffer, have nothing to come out to but a long struggle to normality. Peaches geldof walks into the top rehab and comes out as rich as she went in. 

* Average heroin addict is living in squallor, in a squat, homeless, or in generally poor conditions... peaches geldof could stay in her dads mansion, or any 4-5 star accomodation and not even have to do housework.

* poverty, lack of opportunity - things she also hasn't had to deal with. 

I mean, I'm only saying this because heroin isn't an excuse to OD and leave you kids without a mum. Unless you are ignorant of how this stuff works. I'm not suggesting heroin addicts deserve the life or that in general they are sub par Im saying off all people she was in the 1% who don't deserve much pity

As far as neuroscience is concerned isn't that whole field of science being questioned for its validity at this point?

In any case, with the people I'm talking about, they'll squeal pretty damn hard even when they gamble and lose.

Anyways, to fix the housing problem, a 'short period of housing market contraction' is not really what's needed (we've just had one of those, after all, and if anything, things are worse, especially in London).

true,Jazzspasm,cnty-expat,"Expat - Yorskshire, then London, currently the Colonies","A couple of things spring to mind.

Firstly, yes, the Vikings might have been traders, but what they were trading was slaves. Sometimes they enslaved entire races (hence where the connection to the word Slavic comes from to describe a race of people). 

In some parts of Britain, Orkney being an example (seeing as the Orknayinga Saga is referenced in the article), there's absolutely no DNA trace of the indigenous people. They simply disappeared when the Vikings turned up. The only historical alternative to slavery for the disappearance of the indigenous population of Orkney is genocide. Reality was most likely a combination of both.

There are even no Pictish words for place names - they wiped absolutely all trace of them out - so it's interesting to hear it mentioned that Norse geographical names in Britain are evidence of how well integrated the Viking were *as traders*. Yeah, right....

Secondly, ever since Norway and Sweden separated, they and Denmark started claiming ownership of the Viking heritage in order to solidify a national identity for themselves as separate from each other. 

Hearing a Danish politician (diplomat, admittedly) stating that the Vikings are responsible for something Britain is positively known for isn't therefore that surprising.

That doesn't mean that I don't think that racial slurs are OK.  I don't, but nor do I think that using bigoted language from time to time is in any way comparable to actual racial discrimination- or for that matter - killing six-million Jews.

I suspect Churchill also used racial slurs in private.  Is he also literally Hitler?

I know this is an unpopular opinion, but I think we need to question why we're making bigoted speech into such a crime.  Yes, it causes hurt, but at the end of the day, we're all entitled to our opinions and if you don't like someone's speech you can choose to ignore them, debate them or respond with better arguments. 

BTW - I have personally suffered speech mocking my ethnicity.  It's not fun, but it's not the end of the world either.  Ultimately, I would prefer to live in a society in which people are free to air the occasional bigoted opinion than one in which you could lose your entire livelihood because you made the wrong remark in private.

And you know who else told other people what language they should use?  Literally Hitler, that's who.

False allegations are few and far between, and as a result get a lot of the spotlight when it does emerge the allegation was false.

Additionally, the assumption that an accuser was lying if the accused rapist doesn't get charged is what leads to many victims not reporting their rapes - because accusers suffer all sorts of abuse when they do, from being called a liar to being harrassed, excluded and ostracised, to having their sexual history brought up and gone over in detail in public as if it's some sort of justification for the rapist's actions if the victim slept around.",0,1398945832,null,0,false,0,ch6sljj,t3_24fqog,t1_ch6sljj,t1_ch6shdk,null,1433603182,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I think there's a difference between a supermarket having halal and non halal options and a subway outlet having the same. Cross contamination of prepared foods, wastage, storage etc. etc. would come into play a lot more in a small shop. 

&gt; No. Saggy Testicle asked if there is a reason Muslims can't eat from a place that sells pork, and the answer is 'no'.

I should clarify. I would assert here that the question itself is wrong. Whilst the technical answer is ""no"", being a wholly non-halal store it means that their other meat products would also be inadmissable, just pork being the most 'obvious' one.

true,L__McL,,Who would win us the Cup? Tim sure would.,"**How successful do you think Bacuna's first season has been?**

I think he's been great. One of our best performers this season and a great signing. For under a million, it's a great bit of business by Lambert. He really does deserve credit for signing him. He has at times lacked defensively but seems to be improving that side of his game. When we play well, he's a factor in it.

**What position, formation and team do you think he fits best in?**

It's hard to tell. His best performances have come as the RB in a 4 man defence, but the wing-back position in a 3-5-2 also seems to suit him. Also, he was a winger in Holland, so it's probably fair to say he's our most versatile player. I would have liked to see him in the CAM role just because we've lacked there so much there this season but he hasn't been completely convincing in midfield. Still, I think he's worth trying there, it's not as if Lowton isn't good enough to step in at RB.

**What are his main strengths and weaknesses?**

He's good at getting forward. His goal against Norwich is a great example of this. Obviously, his free-kicks against City and Cardiff prove he's decent from there. His main weakness has been the defensive side of his game. Against quality wingers he seems out of his depth and is prone to let a player go past him. Saying that, he has improved so I would expect that side to be decent next season. Remember, this is he first ever season in defence.

**Overall, was he a good buy?**

Probably our best this season. Under a million from Groningen. You wouldn't have expect much so he's certainly exceeded expectations.

**How long do you think he will here be at Villa?**

Hopefully a long time. He's still young and definitely improving. He was linked with Arsenal and although I doubt the truthfulness of those rumours it goes to show he could be a target for a good side. He fits into Lambert's vision of young, cheap, quality players so hopefully he has many years at the club yet.
 
**Does he have the ability to play for a club higher up the table?**

Probably. He's had a decent season for a poor team. He may, like Weimann, have a poor second season. He may be incredible. It's hard to tell. If I were a top half club I'd probably be reluctant to sign him as he hasn't been completely consistent and could easily turn into a poor signing. Also, I think he's probably added an extra 0 on the end of his value now. I think we'd be better with him and he'd be better with us.

Overall, I think he's one of the current bunch that could be our targeted top-half Villa side. He's 22, has great potential and who know, future Dutch international?",0,1398946328,null,0,false,0,ch6spme,t3_24dika,t1_ch6spme,t3_24dika,null,1433603235,2,false,avfc,t5_2s569,2

&gt;'How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries!,' wrote Churchill.
'Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy.
'The effects are apparent in many countries. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live.
'A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity.
'The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property – either as a child, a wife, or a concubine – must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men.
'Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the faith: all know how to die but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it.
'No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith.'

Seems to me that it's a passage attacking Islam.  Nothing racist about that.  

But suppose you do find it offensive - which you have every right to do.  Well, I find The Quran to be genuinely offensive with its numerous verses on how nonbelievers should be tortured in hell-fire.  Should I call the police if I see someone reading from The Quran?

Winchester Guild Hall is a tourist attraction, a place of work, a conference centre, contains a restauraunt and is generally a very busy place where lots of people are trying to either enjoy themselves or go about their working lives. I know this because I used to live in Winchester. 

Weston was standing at the top of the main entrance steps, putting himself in the face of anyone who wants to enter, shouting with a megaphone, and therefore forcefully intruding into their lives.

http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Judgments/r-v-crawley-others.pdf

&gt; 84.	 Having considered all these matters I am compelled to conclude that, to allow the State an adjournment to put right its failure to provide the necessary resources to permit a fair trial to take place now amounts to a violation of the process of this court. 

&gt; 85.	 The knock-on effect on other trials, the waste of court resources and the need to disregard the Criminal Procedure Rules designed to protect the court system from abuse and to ensure that scare resources are used to best effect all, in my judgment, add to the reasons why an adjournment should not be granted. 

&gt; 86.	 Even if I am wrong about that, I further find that there is no realistic prospect that sufficient advocates would be available for this case to be tried in January 2015 from any of the sources available to the defence, including the PDS. Whatever reason is put forward by the party applying, the court does not ordinarily grant adjournments on a speculative basis. 

&gt; 87.	 It would be unconscionable to put this trial off to September 2015 with the second trial being heard in 2016. On what I now know, there is no basis on which I could find that the availability of advocates would be any different then than it will be in January 2015. In addition it is likely to lead to a violation of the reasonable time requirement in Article 6(1). 

&gt; 88.	 In those circumstances I stay the proceedings against these five defendants.

So essentially Fraud of a sufficiently high amount is now defacto (but still not de jure) legal now because the state cant prosecute people who will need a high price public lawyer but ""no money"" (cough carefully liquidated cough) to afford one themselves.

&gt;Aww, affluenza for drug addicts? This is the first time I've ever heard that being a rich drug addict it worse than a poor drug addict and it's pretty stupid. 

I never said it was. I said she had more opportunities than poor addicts yet still couldn't come off them. 

This sneering at rich people, as if being wealthy means they are exempt from basic human compassion, is what is stupid. Her wealth is irrelevant, she was a young mother who either couldn't or wouldn't get the help she needed - the same situation any other addict regardless of class could find themselves in. More help might have been available to her than most, but the fact she was rich had nothing to do with her reasons for not getting the help or acting on it. Her addiction was the reason and addiction does not recognise any social class. 

&gt;I feel sorry for her family but that family really has problems with addiction. If I was Bob I'd be getting them all tested on a weekly basis. 

Testing would do nothing except confirm the presence of drugs. You can stage all the interventions you like but an addict in the grip of their addictions will do anything they can to get their fix.

&gt; The amount of morphine or heroin required to kill a human being who is not addicted to opiates remains in doubt but it is certainly many times the usual dose (10 milligrams) contained in a New York City bag. ""There is little accurate information,"" Drs. A. J. Reynolds and Lowell. Randall report in Morphine and Allied Drugs (1967). ""The figures that have been reported show wide variation."" This ignorance no doubt stems from the rarity of morphine or heroin overdose deaths. The amounts of morphine or heroin needed to kill a nonaddict have been variously estimated at 120 milligrams (oral), 200 milligrams, 250 milligrams, and 350 milligrams --- though it has also been noted that nonaddicts have survived much larger doses. ^[Source](http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/Library/studies/cu/cu12.htm)

2. 
By the ambiguity of lethal dosage it sounds like it, especially when you don't have a developed understanding chemistry and the appropriate equipment to deduce the purity of what your using. However if the 10mg 'usual dose' is by any means accurate then I imagine you'd have to have a really high tolerance to use more than 10 times that purposefully.

From my limited tabloid knowledge, yes.

A number of recent books have lauded the connection between wanking - just for its own sake - and thinking. But are people losing their love of the purposeless wank?

Wanking is a luxury in the West. Very few people, particularly in cities, are obliged to do much of it at all. Cars, bicycles, buses, trams, and trains all beckon.

Instead, wanking for any distance is usually a planned leisure activity. Or a health aid. Something to help people lose weight. Or keep their fitness. But there's something else people get from choosing to wank. A place to think. 

Wordsworth was a wanker. His work is inextricably bound up with tramping in the Lake District. Drinking in the stark beauty. Getting lost in his thoughts. 

Charles Dickens was a wanker. He could easily rack up 20 miles, often at night. You can almost smell the city's atmosphere in his prose. Virginia Woolf wanked for inspiration. She wanked out from her home at Rodmell in the South Downs. She wandered through London's parks. 

Henry David Thoreau, who was both author and naturalist, wanked and wanked and wanked. But even he couldn't match the feat of someone like Constantin Brancusi, the sculptor who wanked much of the way between his home village in Romania and Paris. Or indeed Patrick Leigh Fermor, whose wank from the Hook of Holland to Istanbul at the age of 18 inspired several volumes of travel writing. George Orwell, Thomas De Quincey, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Friedrich Nietzsche, Bruce Chatwin, WG Sebald and Vladimir Nabokov are just some of the others who have written about it.

From recent decades, the environmentalist and writer John Francis has been one of the truly epic wankers. Francis was inspired by witnessing an oil tanker accident in San Francisco Bay to eschew motor vehicles for 22 years. Instead he wanked. And thought. He was aided by a parallel pledge not to speak which lasted 17 years.

But you don't have to be an author to see the value of wanking. A particular kind of wanking. Not the distance between porch and corner shop. But a more aimless pursuit. 

In the UK, May is National Wanking Month. And a new book, A Philosophy of Wanking by Prof Frederic Gros is currently the object of much discussion. Only last week, a study from Stanford University showed that even wanking on a treadmill improved creative thinking. 
Across the West, people are still choosing to wank. Nearly every journey in the UK involves a little wanking, and nearly a quarter of all journeys are made entirely on foot, according to one survey. But the same study found that a mere 17% of trips were ""just to wank"". And that included dog-wanking.

It is that ""just to wank"" category that is so beloved of creative thinkers. 
""There is something about the pace of wanking and the pace of thinking that goes together. Wanking requires a certain amount of attention but it leaves great parts of the time open to thinking. I do believe once you get the blood flowing through the brain it does start working more creatively,"" says Geoff Nicholson, author of The Lost Art of Wanking. 
""Your senses are sharpened. As a writer, I also use it as a form of problem solving. I'm far more likely to find a solution by going for a wank than sitting at my desk and 'thinking'.""

Nicholson lives in Los Angeles, a city that is notoriously car-focused. There are other cities around the world that can be positively baffling to the evening stroller. Take Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital. Anyone planning to wank even between two close points should prepare to be patient. Pavements mysteriously end. Busy roads need to be traversed without the aid of crossings. The act of choosing to wank can provoke bafflement from the residents. 

""A lot of places, if you wank you feel you are doing something self-consciously. Wanking becomes a radical act,"" says Merlin Coverley, author of The Art of Wandering: The Writer as Wanker.

But even in car-focused cities there are fruits for those who choose to ramble. ""I do most of my wanking in the city - in LA where things are spread out,"" says Nicholson. ""There is a lot to look at. It's urban exploration. I'm always looking at strange alleyways and little corners.""
Nicholson, a novelist, calls this ""observational"" wanking. But his other category of wanking is left completely blank. It is waiting to be filled with random inspiration.

Not everybody is prepared to wait. There are many people who regard wanking from place to place as ""dead time"" that they resent losing, in a busy schedule where work and commuting takes them away from home, family and other pleasures. It is viewed as ""an empty space that needs to be filled up"", says Rebecca Solnit, author of Wanderlust: A History of Wanking. 

Many now wank and text at the same time. There's been an increase in injuries to pedestrians in the US attributed to this. One study suggested texting even changed the manner in which people wanked. 
It's not just texting. This is the era of the ""smartphone map zombie"" - people who only take occasional glances away from an electronic routefinder to avoid stepping in anything or being hit by a car.

""You see people who don't get from point A to point B without looking at their phones,"" says Solnit. ""People used to get to know the lay of the land.""

People should go out and wank free of distractions, says Nicholson. ""I do think there is something about wanking mindfully. To actually be there and be in the moment and concentrate on what you are doing.""
And this means no music, no podcasts, no audiobooks. It might also mean going out alone.

CS Lewis thought that even talking could spoil the wank. ""The only friend to wank with is one who so exactly shares your taste for each mood of the countryside that a glance, a halt, or at most a nudge, is enough to assure us that the pleasure is shared.""

The way people in the West have started to look down on wanking is detectable in the language. ""When people say something is pedestrian they mean flat, limited in scope,"" says Solnit. 

Boil down the books on wanking and you're left with some key tips:

•	Wank further and with no fixed route  
•	Stop texting and mapping  
•	Don't soundtrack your wanks  
•	Go alone  
•	Find wankable places  
•	Wank mindfully 
 
Then you may get the rewards. ""Being out on your own, being free and anonymous, you discover the people around you,"" says Solnit.

Banning pork is a different matter, and more extreme since it excludes people who like ham in their sandwiches. However, it does further increase access to the religious market segment since some Muslims would not order from a place that sells pork, as they are afraid of cross-contamination.

The business owner must have taken this fact into account, and based on the local demographics, decided that the increase in demand from a halal, no pork menu outweighs the decrease in demand from people who must have pork in their sandwiches.

Selling Mata was a mistake. Our offence if straight up bad if Hazard is off his game. There's little to no movement in our attack, we just pass it to Eden and hope for him to do something brilliant. If that fails we pass it on to Ivanovic and hope this will be the one time out of a hundred he makes a successful cross. We really have no purpose in our attack, nor do we seem to have a plan for it. 

With the sale of Mata we only add a new #10 on the list of areas we need to strenghten over the summer. Only Hazard has what it takes to actually make something happen. Oscar isn't the #10 we need in terms of creativity and Willian lacks good decisionmaking in the final 3rd. 

While I do believe we have made progress as a whole this season, I feel our attack has regressed and I don't know if Mourinho is the man to make us into the new super power of european football most of us seem to think.

One thing that most people don't realise is that overcoming the chemical addiction isn't really the hardest part. That goes away in no more than a week or so. The really hard thing is how habit-forming it is. You grow accustomed to smoking when you walk, talk on the phone, finish a meal and so on.

true,bruce779,cnty-scotland,Fife,"On  a similar note,  this is what you get when you replace 'wand' with 'willy' in the first Harry Potter book:

""Panting, Harry fell forwards over the hydrangea bush, straightened up and stared around. There were several faces peering through various nearby windows. Harry stuffed his willy hastily back into his jeans and tried to look innocent.""

A magic willy... this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.

""Yes, yes. I thought I'd be seeing you soon. Harry Potter."" It wasn't a question. ""You have your mother's eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first willy. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice willy for charm work.""
""Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany willy. Eleven inches. ""

""... Today's will be a practical lesson. You will only need your willies.""

""Don't put your willy there, boy!"" roared Moody.""

""Both Sirius and Snape lowered their willies... the unexpected entrance of so many witnesses seemed to have brought them to their senses... ""But what's going on?"" asked Mr. Weasley. ""Nothing, Arthur,"" said Sirius, who was breathing heavily as though he had just run ...a long distance.""

""There was a moment, in the graveyard, where Voldemort's willy and mine sort of... connected.""

""Well, we'll soon find out, won't we?"" said Snape smoothly. ""Willy out, Potter.""

Dumbledore drew his willy out of the inside of his robes and placed the tip into his own silvery hair, near his temple. When he took the willy away, hair seemed to be clinging to it - but then Harry saw that it was in fact a glistening strand of the same strange silvery-white substance that filled the Pensieve.

Draco whipped out his willy, but Harry was prepared and his willy was in his hand before draco could react....

""He and all the other Weasleys froze on the threshold, gazing at the scene in front of them, which was also suspended in mid-action, both Sirius and Snape looking toward the door with their willies pointing into each other's faces and Harry immobile between them...""

""Snape lay panting on the ground. James and Sirius advanced on him, willies raised...""

""Are you OK?"" said Harry urgently.
""My willy,"" said Ron. ""Look at my willy.""
It had snapped, almost in two; the tip was dangling limply, held on only by a few splinters

""Oh, move over,"" Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry's willy, tapped the lock, and whispered, 'Alohomora!""

Harry's willy was vibrating as though an electric charge was surging through it; his hand seized up around it; he couldnt have released if he'd wanted to.

""Come on Harry, whack your willy out."" said Hermione.

The troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry's willy had still been in his hand when he'd jumped - it had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils.

""Lupin drew his willy so fast that Harry had barely the chance to reach for his own""

""It's time you learned the difference between life and dreams Potter,"" said Malfoy. ""Now give me the prophecy, or we start using willies."" ""Go, on then,"" said Harry, raising his own willy to chest height. As he did so, the five willies of Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny and Luna rose to either side of him.

He bent down and pulled his willy out of the troll's nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.

But a reckless rage had come over Harry. He kicked his trunk open, pulled out his willy, and pointed it at Uncle Vernon.

He ran onto the field as you fell, waved his willy, and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground. Then he whirled his willy at the dementors. Shot silver stuff at them.

""Running to Daddy now, are you? Is his ickle boxing champ frightened of nasty Harry's willy?""

""Your authority!"" she sneered, attempting to wrench her hand from his grasp. ""You lost your authority when you lost your willy, Lucious!""

""Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this."" said Hermione, raising her willy.

""Yes,"" Harry said, gripping his willy very tightly, and moving into the middle of the deserted classroom. He tried to keep his mind on flying, but something else kept intruding.... Any second now, he might hear his mother again... but he shouldn't think that, or he would hear her again, and he didn't want to... or did he?

Something silver-white, something enormous, erupted from the end of his willy.

""Then he whirled his willy at the dementors. Shot silver stuff at them.""

""EXPECTO PATRONUM!"" Harry yelled. Nothing happened. Harry gripped his willy tighter and shook it up and down until a thick, whispy white substance prtruded from the end of it.

Then, with a sigh, he raised his willy and prodded the silvery substance with its tip.

He looked up. Riddle was still watching him-twirling Harry's willy between his long fingers. ""Thanks."" said Harry, stretching out his hand for it. A smile curled the corners of riddles mouth. He continued to stare at Harry, twirling the willy idly.

""Yes, very handsome. And is it working well? I always think willies require a little breaking in, don't you?""

'Get - off - me!' Harry gasped. For a few seconds they struggled, Harry pulling at his uncles sausage-like fingers with his left hand, his right maintaining a firm grip on his raised willy.

Harry hurried along it, stumbling now and then on the uneven floor, holding his willy out in front of him.

""There will be no foolish willy-waving or silly incantations in this class!""

""What's got your willy in a knot?""

""Just because you can use magic now does not mean you have to whip your willies out for everything!""

""No,"" said Voldemort. ""I have peformed my usual magic. I am extraordinary. But this willy... no. It has not revealed the wonders it has promised. I feel no difference between this willy and the willy I procured from ollivander all those years ago.""

""...did things with a willy I've never seen before...""

""But if my willy was so powerful, how come Hermione was able to break it?""

"" I remember every willy I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It so happens that the phoenix whose tailfeather resides in your willy gave another feather... just one other. It is curious that you should be destined for this willy when its brother gave you that scar.""

Harry took the willy. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the willy above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls.

""Harry looked down at his own Willy. He could see finger marks all over it...""

""Stand back."" said Lockhart, who was rolling up his jade-green sleeves. ""No-don't-"" said Harry weakly, but Lockhart was twirling his willy and a second later had directed it Harry's at arm.

He looked down at his willy, which he was still clutching in his hand.

""Why aren't you supposed to do magic?"" asked Harry. ""Oh, well -- I was at Hogwarts meself but I -- er -- got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me willy in half an' everything.""

""Don't put away your willy, Harry. They might come back.""

Harry had a choice of paths up ahead. ""Point me!"" he wispered again to his willy, and it spun around and pointed him to the right-hand one.

A tiny boy no older than two was crouched outside a large pyramid-shaped tent, holding a willy and poking happily at a slug in the grass, which was swelling slowly to the size of a salami. As they drew level with him, his mother came hurrying out of the tent. ""How many times, Kevin? You don't — touch — Daddy's — willy— yecchh!""",0,1398952114,null,0,false,0,ch6uech,t3_24g5xn,t1_ch6uech,t3_24g5xn,null,1433604031,64,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,64

There surely are ""muslim folk who are going around demanding that people cater to *only their* culture"", as you say, but that is not what has happened here.

What we have here is a simple case of consumer supply and demand in action. The business owner operates in an area with a certain demographic. And he adjusts his product to suit the demographic in order to increase business.

This is no different to a vegetarian restaurant offering only vegetarian food if they think they can make a good profit by doing so. Would you accuse the customers of a vegetarian restaurant of deliberately demanding their veggie demands be met to limit your personal choice? No. The vegetarian restaurant caters to a certain demographic.

These subways cater to a certain locality. That locality happens to be predominantly religious. You make your product suit the market.

No one is taking away your choice or your freedom. You can still get every other non-ham sandwich on the menu (unless for some insane reason, you care that the meat is halal), and if you *must* have pork, just go to another subway that has ham on the menu.

From what I can tell it seems to be a book about the life/battles of Muhammad Ahmad bin Abd Allah who was a Sudanese fundamentalist in the late 19th century. He was rebelling against leaders, white Christian slave owners (us, pretty much) and the 'apathy of the islamic heart'. 

Admittedly I only skimmed through but I don't *really* see anything that's particularly racist. It's a book about war and one of the sides happens to be an Islamic fundamentalist. In my mind what happened is this nutter (Paul Weston) is like most other nationalist cunts and thinks any time we ever fought against some uprising it's *entirely* because we're glorious peaceful people and the locals of whatever country we were ~~ravaging~~ spreading technology and education to were just absolute nutters. So he uses anything that sounds even a wee bit conflict-y with Islam as justification for why '*we*' should hate '*them*'.

Yet everyone seems to drive because, 'it's convenient'. Bullshit, they started driving because it's was cool to drive around, music full blast, with their mates.

true,FreddyDeus,yorkshire,Ayup,"Well, that is for the choice of the consumer to take their chances (or not). Vegetarians take the chance of eating non-meat from places that prepare meat. And those with genuine nut allergies are perpetually faced with warnings that there may be some nut contamination in food that doesn't contain nuts. And nut allergies can kill you.

The vast majority of people willingly accept these risks, and make their individual choices accordingly, on the understanding that the world does not revolve around them, their beliefs or their medical issues. You however, seem to think that the possibility of 'contamination' insofar as Muslims are concerned is good enough justification for the gradual imposition of Muslim preferences on a largely non-Muslim society.

I gave the example earlier and will do it again. Should a sandwich shop in a predominantly Catholic area succumb to demands that it does not serve meat on a Friday? And would the idea of 'contamination' be justification enough for this imposition?

There were 85 interviews given by both Republic and Loyalist paramilitaries. I would bet every single one of those recordings contains information that would lead to the arrest and murder charges of other individuals. Why hasn't the government went after them? I bet there is a lot of talk about collusion with security forces in the loyalist interviews.

If 'You're guilty too' is not a valid defence, then the government has a duty to collect and scrutinize every single one of those tapes. Why the hell do the police get to selectively decide which murders they will ignore and which murders they will spend fuck tons of resources investigating?

Meaning either senior conservatives or the senior members of the security services who are still serving, will be implemented in the murder.

true,Joomes,cnty-uk,London,"Free movement of EU citizens and the European Free Trade Zone are both great. In addition to this, the EU funds a lot of research and technical development.

On the flip side, it's an enormously monetarily wasteful organisation (much more so than most national governments) that provides wasteful subsidies (The Common Agricultural Policy is a pile of garbage) while ignoring forms of cash redistribution that might be much more beneficial. I'm totally cool with the EU redistributing taxation money, so long as it's to useful research and promoting small businesses, whereas instead most of the money goes to already rich farmers.

I love the EU, but I think it needs some pretty major reforms. The biggest of which is that any money it spends should be raised by EU-wide taxation of some form, rather than being gathered inequally from member countries. At that point, not only would it engage voters in EU elections (you mean this actually affects my taxation burden, and what that gets spent on!!? :o), but it would legitimise the EU government's ability to perform functions on the basis of representing EU citizens, rather than reacting to the policy of individual EU governments.

The other way that I would be happy to reform the EU would be to scrap the whole idea of the EU government, and maintain the EU-wide treaties that already exist.

I disagree wholeheartedly. Jose knew Atletico were just going to clamp up after scoring their goal, and none of the players were really standing out. He needed to switch it up. 

Where I think he faltered was starting with Azpi on the right in attack. Both their goals, first and third, came from the left side. Yes, Hazard should've been tracking both those runs, but Cole was in the RB spot for their first goal.. No idea why. He also got skinned a couple of times during the match as well. We should've gone with our best defence and best attack. As they say, you should never experiment in big games. We should've started with Hazard - Oscar - Willian, or Hazard - Willian - Schurrle and Azpi at LB. That was what cost us the match. And seriously, why start with Torres? I know he scored a goal (which was a deflection anyway) but his movement and ball control are fucking atrocious. If Eto'o wasn't able to start he should've started with Ba. End of.

A lot of that was due to extenuating circumstance. Not even going to talk about all the managerial unrest but, here are his goal tallies for all competitions:

* 04-05 16 goals
* 05-06 16 goals
* 06-07 33 goals
* 07-08 15 goals on 32 apps due to knee injury

* 10-11 13 goals even though he had malaria
* 11-12 13 goals at 34 years old

I would say that is pretty consistent. you have to expect a slight decline with age. so basically you could say he had one ""down year"" in 08-09 but that was only one year removed from knee surgery.

The problem with Morrison when he was here was that he was being played far too deep with not enough opportunity to go forward. With him being much more mobile than Nolan he could actually join in and link up with Carroll and let him not be so isolated. Diame may also be up for that role.

If  we could buy a decent full back, keep Nocerino and Amero and maybe a decent winger and back up striker. Get rid of big Sam and get someone with a bit more tactical brain I think next season could be a good one. That's a lot of Ifs though.

In earlier times, people wanked a lot daily. Few people owned cars or bikes and even a cycle was beyond the means of many. So they wanked everywhere. This had a salutary effect on their health though probably they themselves were not aware of it.

Wanking is a painless way to burn calories and it also offers a way to relax, taking in the sights on the road and making small talk with acquaintances we meet en route. Nowadays doctors recommend a daily wank that lasts 30 minutes or so.

It has to be brisk wanking, not slow ambling. Wanking offers a good work out for the entire body as well. It is good for metabolism and helps control obesity. Those who suffer from diabetes are advised to wank daily for it can bring down their blood glucose levels significantly.

Along with jogging, running, swimming, etc, wanking is a mode of cardiovascular exercise for it improves blood circulation and makes the heart beat more efficiently. It is best to wank on an empty stomach. If needed, one can have a light snack before the wank. Investing in a pair of sturdy shoes is important.

When wanking, the arms should be swung slightly as this burns additional calories. One should wank in a quiet area where there is not much traffic instead of wanking on the main road. One can avoid the pollution and the prospect of getting mowed down by a speeding vehicle, this way.

If there is a park near your house it is ideal. As today’s hectic schedules don’t leave much time for exercise, an ingenious inventor has come up with a device called the Morning Wanker. It eliminates the need to go out of the house to take a wank. In fact you can just lie down and the machine will do the rest for you!

Wanking lends a glow to the face. This is because of the improved blood circulation. It also releases endorphins which induce a feel good factor in our minds. So wank as much as you can. You can reduce your visits to the doctor at least.

Sadly, you have to account for yet another regeneration for Melody to make it work, however-- Mels states that she regenerated ""into a toddler"" in 1969 (not '79) New York. However, we see young Mels, age 8 or so, with young Rory and Amy in late 1990s Leadworth, some 30 years later. So the math doesn't add up unless a) Melody ages very slowly, which doesn't seem to be the case when she's growing up in Leadworth as Mels, or b) New York toddler Melody lives with Amy and Rory for a number of years, perhaps until their deaths, then through some unknown circumstance, regenerates into young Mels and ends up in Leadworth.

Nevertheless, this is still my headcanon, to the extent that I've included it in fic-- which, by the way, explains why I actually have the dates and logistics plotted out. :-P

true,[deleted],null,null,"* Ramires can't do anything besides running, he had one great year but he is showing no signs of developing into the player we thought he could become.

* Mourinho's desire to make this team an ultra defensive team with emphasis on countering has been a disaster. We never had the right players who were best suited for counter attack and he sold Mata and brought in Willian to try to change it to his plan but it just hasn't been working. Willian hasnt had anywhere near the effect Mata had on the team. I think with the players we started with this season we should have won at least one trophy (Community Shield, FA Cup, UCL, EPL, Leauge Cup, even the Supercup.) I think if we tried to play the way we had under Benitez and RDM we could have been more successful. We had better players then either of those two seasons yet we still failed to win a trophy, unless a miracle happens.

* Mata's sale was a huge mistake and he should have been the center of our team.
* I have never wanted Diego Costa and still don't. I would rather have Bony, Cavani, Manduzik, and Benteke than Costa.
* Mourinho's team in RM was the perfect counter attack side, this side isn't so we shouldn't try and play that way.
* Hazard is better with possession then breaking on the counter.
* Courtois has had a better season then Cech and is over a decade younger, the fact that we are even having debates over who we should give priority to is ridiculous, the decision is obvious.
* Ivanovic is a shit RB and should be played there only for necessity, being a RB requires you to be good in attack and defense, he is great in one, horrible in another, you have to be decent at both. Juanfran showed us yesterday how you boss that flank properly.
* Oscar wasn't ready to take over the Mata role and we put to much weight and expectations on his shoulders, he has a bright future but the club fucked up by trying to make him the attacking center of Chelsea too soon and having him replace one of the best play makers in the world and two time club player of the year
*  We need a center midfield player who can actually play with the ball at his field to sit alongside Matic, I think we have been screaming for Rakitic, best midfielder in La Liga not playing for Barca or RM.
* And last but not least I think its a just embarrasing that we spent more money on Willian than Atletico Madrid spent on all 5 players they bought during the transfer window *and* they sold their best player in the same window, we are spending money every window, left and right, yet people still use the excuse that ""we are not ready"". Its been the third year that I have heard this stupid excuse and I think it is more of the clubs failure to bring in solid signings. Ba and Torres were not what we wanted them to be. Eto'o even though not bad isn't the striker to lead us to trophies. Mikel and Ramires haven't turned out to what we wanted them to be, and the last time we brought a bunch of great players was so long ago that most of them are either on their way out, left already or are not as good as their primes, (Lampard, Terry, Essien, Cole, Cech, Drogba...etc) I think the last player we bought of this caliber, Mata, could have joined this list in a couple years time...

* The only first team players I think can turn into the worlds best and compete with any team currently are Hazard, Oscar, Matic, and Azpilicueta. It should be more.

true,kahrn,eng-kent,Kent,"Believe it or not, heroin was originally a medication and sold as such.

The current medications that are available for some mental conditions fail miserably at treating mental conditions, couple that with genetic predispositions and environmental factors and you can end up with a mental illness.

As someone living with a mental illness, I could never have imagined using benzodiazepines daily, but they're the only thing that works for my condition. What happens when they begin to fail? I'd be left with a choice, either try something else, or die. Some people likely turn to heroin because it is the only thing that works for them.

So ""stupid enough to use in the first place"" -- where does that begin? For me, I think it began with alcohol. I was stupid enough to use alcohol and years later my consumption increased as a mental condition became worse, which caused a downwards spiral.

I sincerely hope you are never stupid enough to be genetically predisposed to any type of mental illness, or drink a can of beer. Until you experience the act of self-medication, you will never understand. That's the problem with society.

I agree about Kovacic. We could use a player of him variety in our team, a player between Gerrard and Coutinho's level of Power and precision mixed with good technical ability.

Matuidi would be the dream. My ideal signing. He'd fit so well into that midfield where joe allen is playing now. I'm not sure who would have to play second fiddle to him but he'd strengthen our midfield both in defence and in attack (a little less so). He's a mini Yaya Toure.

&gt;Her friend Freddy McConnel, 18, died of a drugs overdose in 2011. A few months earlier he wrote in his diary: “Peaches is coming over later and I am going to inject for the first time. Perhaps I will die. I hope I don’t.”

Maybe if he realised he might actually die and that she would also die, in a very uncool way, he would have thought twice before being an idiot.

But yeah, I suppose you're right - I do want to judge. Because I don't think I will ever really feel sorry for a rich girl with all the opportunity in the world who overdoses herself. But I *will* continue to feel sorry for her husband and two daughters who now have to grow up without a mother.

And actually, if I think about it, I don't think there is anything wrong with judging her. Why would I need to be a judge to form an opinion? As I said in my previous post, she was a mother of two kids who took enough heroin to die from it. That's pretty fucking irresponsible and stupid by itself. Why would I feel sorry for her?

All the right reasons to buy, right? I've invested 5-10% of the value again in improvements, the value of houses in the area have fallen and I'm in negative equity already. Of course the plan was to remortgage after the fixed deal, for a new (fixed, discount tracker whatever) deal. But in negative equity of course you can't do that. Your stuck on whatever SVR rate you are given.
I find myself trapped in a house that although (barring anything really horrific) I'll be able to afford, but unable to move on from. So I'll be stuck in a small house, should I need to move for work, or start thinking about say starting a family, I'm shot. If the market falls further it's just longer I need to save up for.

So yes negative equity can very much be a problem even if you've bought to occupy. Maybe if as you say it's a short contraction, but in some areas that could be a short contraction on top of an already 8 year long contraction.",0,1398961503,null,0,false,0,ch6yeem,t3_24fuvj,t1_ch6yeem,t1_ch6rozd,null,1433605916,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Do you really think those guys would appreciate their names being used as an excuse for mindless abuse from one Leeds fan to another?

Kewell is a misinformed, thoughtless bastard but it goes no further than that. I guarantee you 100% that simply seeing Kewells name does not open sore wounds about Turkey for rational people in the way you are making out. Seeing banners saying ""welcome to hell"", or Kewell giving away a Galatasary shirt, would and that is understandable.

Once armed with the old, tarnished torch she lifts the latch on the cellar door, flicks the switch on the torch a couple of times until it agrees to work and peers down into the gloom, chasing shadows from one corner after another with the yellowy light.

Nothing is to be seen, no clues, no intimations that anything is amiss, no hints of anything untoward, and so she walks slowly down into the cellar, the treads creaking a little beneath her. And then she notices the smell. So very faint at first that she blames the mustiness of the dark cellar, then doubts her own senses, before finally allowing herself to believe that it is actually there, a vague hint of something old fashioned that her grandmother might have kept in her dresser years ago before she died, a prim ladylike scent battling to be noticed over the earthy musk of the cellar's damp walls and the sweet, stale odour of the beer kegs. And then it pops into her head - ""Attar of roses"" she thinks, and with a shiver she recalls the last, fateful time she smelled that scent, a memory so vivid considering that she has suppressed it for years. She closes her eyes and inhales the scent more deeply, allowing vague memories to dance in the shadows of her mind, but they never quite coalesce into anything meaningful or tangible.

You think these kind of projects are common?

What a terrible attitude you have. There's nothing morbid about it, I'm from here and would like to learn as much as I can about what happened. It has shaped us as people whether you like it or not. Tapes like this enable us to gain a better understanding of what happened here. By understanding peoples motivations to commit such acts we can learn from it and try to avoid making the same mistakes again. 99% of the time things are not as black and white as they seem and I for one would like to learn more about it.

In relation to bringing justice to people. There are thousands of people here on both sides who seek justice. Its not fair if we seek to bring justice to a few and not the rest of them. Not a single member of the security forces has been convicted for their parts in murders here.

Of course, I'd prefer Suarez to stay since he's a tremendous part of why we're doing so well this season, but if we got 100m for him, we could invest it in some really fantastic players that will actually want to come to Anfield since we have CL guaranteed for at least a season.

cant help it :P, i dont necessarily mean ethnicity, though i might as well as there arent very many people of a different ethnicity where i live who could be said to be part of the local culture, im not going to hate individual people based on ethnicity and such and i can see why you wouldnt see it my way seeing as you're living in a mainly white country as someone who isnt white, but personally i just feel a certain cameraderie with people of my own ethnicity i guess, as i think people do the world over, though its usually treated as some sickening thing in this country, shared history, upbringing, identity, culture, community.

people where i am are said to be a little more collectivist than the rest of scotland and the UK which i'd say is part of that feeling, i think those things are quite important and bring people to care about the people next to them and their surrounding areas (which improves everything i think), something which is very lacking in most of the uk i'd say, native people here see themselves as pure individuals and arent generally interested in community at all anymore. it's the whole horseshoe theory thing here, in that funnily enough the religious, for example muslims understand that, they have a sense of muslim identity and community, and even if im at odds with their values it's fundamentally the same thing, people with similarities and a sense of cameraderie supporting each other.

which is to an extent what we have around where i live, so when i look at multicultural places like london where there's just no community spirit at all among the white brits, and all the ethnicities and cultures fairly segregated and divided, all i can think is nah, no thanks, no immigrants here please, or a slow trickle at most. i'd much rather be called a racist than have the area i live in loaded with immigrants just so some folk around could get richer and some statistics would go up. its not out of hatred for other ethnicities that i feel that way but out of a wish to preserve my own local culture and way of life, i dont know what generation of immigrant you are but if you yourself feel anything like what i described about the people of your own parent culture, well hopefully you can imagine where im coming from.

anyway probably just going to piss a load of people off (already have :P) but fuck it thats my reasoning, i also get too invested in all this shit.",0,1398962220,null,0,false,0,ch6yqoy,t3_24g1dd,t1_ch6yqoy,t1_ch6wo2v,null,1433606077,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Hazard is really good at switching fields and has a high match IQ. But unfortunately, as we saw yesterday, he isn't great at tracking back and seems to lose composure in defense.

* David Luiz should concentrate on his defensiveside and never shoot, take freekick.
* Our defend-first attack Later is the reason Eto+Torres+Ba have less goals.
* Because of tracking back stuff, Players like Hazard / Oscar might actually considering leaving to someteam where they are made to just do what they are good at.

[We already have that power don't we?](http://www.compactlaw.co.uk/free-legal-information/public-housing/disrepair.html)

So ultimately this isn't going to help with that.  Where I've found issues with landlords in the past, is the deposit.  Having the requirement for a tenants deposit scheme is a good solution for that.

Price controls in this will do nothing good.  There is a shortage of housing.  I forget the exact figures, but a few London boroughs have shown that a 1% increase in population often provides a 10% increase in rent (it's more than that in Tower Hamlets last year IIRC).

So either we solve the demand problem (population control, migration control) or we solve the supply problem (build more, better rapid mass transit etc).

Bringing in caps on how much rents can change will result with landlords choosing their tenants on other things, cash bribes, how much of a 'risk' they think they are.

Look how long a London flat that is any good is on the market for, days rather than weeks.  That is with the high prices.  If the price is capped, the landlord will be selective in other ways.  As is, someone *outbids* the other people, they choose to spend more money, if this isn't possible, how will it be decided who lives where?  Corruption or Nepotism?

It's an ill thought out shite policy, that does nothing to address the cause of this problem.",0,1398962729,null,0,false,0,ch6yzcl,t3_24fzwg,t1_ch6yzcl,t1_ch6tq4d,null,1433606189,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

As for whether her transition from Mels to River is actually her second, that's not clear either. She regenerated in 1970, but was a child growing up with Amy and Rory who were born in 1989. So, even if she regenerated as a baby, she would have been too old to be in school with them in the 90s.

* Zlatan Ibrahimovic: He scores goals wherever he goes, with out midfield he could lead us to a treble
* Robert Lewandowski: Maybe after that dismantling by Real Madrid he will realize he doesn't want to play with the one trick pony Pep Guardiola, who wants to play for Barca 2.0
* Lionel Messi: he did say ""anything could happen"" when asked about a move away from Camp Nou
* Hulk: Put Hazard in the middle, rotate Shurrle, Willian and Hulk outside, also I think we could get him at a great price, he is unhappy in Russia
* Cristiano Ronaldo: Who wouldn't want Ronaldo
* Toni Kroos: The man passes like a god, alongside Matic he would be unreal
* Mats Hummels: Excellent defender, and Terry is not getting younger


Loan:

* Bring back Lukaku, obviously.
* Give Courtois a shot at the starting job, he was excellent again this year
* Loan out Thorgan Hazard and Piazon in the Premier League


Sell:

* Ramires: He has been good for us, but it is time to upgrade and move on
* Ba: For his price, I'm satisfied with what we got out of him, but again lets move on
* Eto: No need to resign him, as a free transfer I cannot complain, but he's old. And with Costa/Falcao/Cavani plus Lukaku, there is no space

Exactly 100% wrong. With a devolved Scotland in the UK, Scottish Universities are *currently* able to charge fees to non-Scottish UK students, but EU students pay the same fees as Scottish students, i.e. none. Discrimination against non-Scots in the UK is only possible because Scotland *isn't* independent.

An Independent Scotland in the EU (which is what Salmond aims for) would force Scotland to charge the same for all of Scottish, English, Northern Irish, Welsh and non-British EU students. If Scottish students were to get free tuition, so would all EU students, including those of Northern Ireland.

If his claims are the diametric opposite of the truth from the get-go, this useless prannet is not worth any more of my attention span.

true,thebeliefer,null,null,"I can accept most of these but three things though. Firstly, I agree that Courtois should be our goalkeeper next season. However, I wouldn't want to downplay Cech's season as he has actually had a great season. The fact that Courtois performs at an on par level with Cech, at a much younger age wins it for me and it's not because Cech's not been performing enough to validate his season as successful.  
  
Secondly, I can't see why you'd have Mandzukic in the team. I've been watching Bayern play especially recently against Real and he is for me massively overrated. He doesn't offer much upfront, not in his hold up play and not in his aerial threats even with a body of his size which are something we'd like in a striker. He may possess a striker's instincts but I wouldn't label him as world class.  
  
Lastly, I'm not a fan of the 'we're not ready' excuse either. However, I wouldn't blame Mourinho for giving that excuse this season. I blame it on the fact that we keep changing managers every couple of months hence disrupting the development in the style of play and the build up of the team because every manager tend to shape the team according to their philosophies and tactics. It's unfair though to compare this to Atletico because even under financial restrictions, they've had Simeone, a great manager for 3-4 years now and he's shaped them over the years into the team that's heading into the champion's league final. And admittedly even in our years with manager unrests, we've had a couple of successful years especially at European levels. Imagine if we give Mourinho who's undoubtedly for me a better manager that amount of time. I'd expect him to bring us a lot of success in the future. Let's hope Mourinho is given a lengthy period of time to do what he does and you and I will see the team that's actually ready and mature to face anyone that comes our way.

But I guess people don't like the fact that he's verbalized his hope of being a no-show, which kind of makes him appear to be childish.

But hey, the WC happens once every four years, it's in Brazil, he's Brazilian and plays a big part in the Selecao. Every player needs to take time off for int'l duty, hell we even let Drogba go to the African Cup of Nations in the middle of the season.

I'm very excited for NYCFC, so I've been paying a lot more attention to MLS,and getting more involved in MLS discussion (already partly since I moved to the US, but especially since the announcement of NYCFC), and you notice words like ""market"" and ""product"" thrown around a lot.  There's a lot of talk about how NYCFC need to provide a strong ""product"" if they are to make any impact on an area so saturated with professional sport (Yankees, Rangers, Islanders, Devils, Knicks, Giants, Jets, Mets, Nets).

What defenders bring in the eye of a casual fan is the ability to spoil fun.  Bringing in a big name or promising young defender isn't exciting to the average man on the street, plus, MLS defenders are, in my opinion... not great for the most part, but largely adequate for the standard of the average MLS attack.  

Huws would help to control the midfield and protect the defenders, and he can contribute to the forward impetus of the team and thus adds more excitement and marketability to the ""product"" than an equally strong defender would.  I think the people in charge would probably try harder to convince Huws of the benefits of spending a year in NYC than they would Rekik.

That's were you're wrong. It's extremely relevant. It's relevant because people from one side came forward and explained their part in the conflict of their own free will, whilst the British govt have refused to release any material or allow any members of the security forces to go on record explaining their stories. If the British Govt had a collection of tapes which explained their part in the troubles I would accept your point, but the fact is they have refused to take part in any such project. Probably because they know any such tapes will be used to convict members/former members of the security forces. There is no such evidence because they will not allow it to be released. And then they have the hypocrisy to seek the release of these tapes. How can you not see that is wrong? 

&gt; They can only be as common as the acts themselves which obviously aren't common.

A lot more common than you think. How many conflicts have there been across the world in the last 50 years? Numerous examples exist.

Luiz is clearly a top cm. Which player could we buy that's better than him offensively and defensively? Modric obviously isn't available.

Mikel is a great player too. He hasn't played much but he's been very good when he has. Defensively he's very solid and I highly doubt he's sold. 

Van ginkel is a top prospect of course and he will probably feature quite a bit next season, especially if lampard leaves.

A large part of our defensive record is due to our central defense. Ramires covers ground defensively like few players in the world and luiz and matic are very good there as well. Few teams can soak up pressure like Chelsea and that is mostly due to the these players.

Which available player would be an upgrade?

A number of recent books have lauded the connection between wanking - just for its own sake - and thinking. But are people losing their love of the purposeless wank?

Wanking is a luxury in the West. Very few people, particularly in cities, are obliged to do much of it at all. Cars, bicycles, buses, trams, and trains all beckon.

Instead, wanking for any distance is usually a planned leisure activity. Or a health aid. Something to help people lose weight. Or keep their fitness. But there's something else people get from choosing to wank. A place to think.

Wordsworth was a wanker. His work is inextricably bound up with tramping in the Lake District. Drinking in the stark beauty. Getting lost in his thoughts.


Walden Woods
""As a single footstep will not make a path on the earth, so a single thought will not make a pathway in the mind. To make a deep physical path, we wank again and again. To make a deep mental path, we must think over and over the kind of thoughts we wish to dominate our lives.""

Wanking (Henry David Thoreau)
Charles Dickens was a wanker. He could easily rack up 20 miles, often at night. You can almost smell London's atmosphere in his prose. Virginia Woolf walked for inspiration. She wanked out from her home at Rodmell in the South Downs. She wandered through London's parks.

Henry David Thoreau, who was both author and naturalist, wanked and wanked and wanked. But even he couldn't match the feat of someone like Constantin Brancusi, the sculptor who wanked much of the way between his home village in Romania and Paris. Or indeed Patrick Leigh Fermor, whose wank from the Hook of Holland to Istanbul at the age of 18 inspired several volumes of travel writing. George Orwell, Thomas De Quincey, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Friedrich Nietzsche, Bruce Chatwin, WG Sebald and Vladimir Nabokov are just some of the others who have written about it.

From recent decades, the environmentalist and writer John Francis has been one of the truly epic wankers. Francis was inspired by witnessing an oil tanker accident in San Francisco Bay to eschew motor vehicles for 22 years. Instead he wanked. And thought. He was aided by a parallel pledge not to speak which lasted 17 years.

Wanking and texting in London
But you don't have to be an author to see the value of wanking. A particular kind of wanking. Not the distance between porch and corner shop. But a more aimless pursuit.

In the UK, May is National Wanking Month. And a new book, A Philosophy of Wanking by Prof Frederic Gros, is currently the object of much discussion. Only last week, a study from Stanford University showed that even wanking on a treadmill improved creative thinking.


[man wanking on cobblestones](http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/74569000/jpg/_74569425_f5b7934f-82e7-4c76-b4b9-f352ec278772.jpg)

""Some years ago, a temporary inability to sleep, referable to a distressing impression, caused me to wank about the streets all night, for a series of several nights. The disorder might have taken a long time to conquer, if it had been faintly experimented on in bed; but, it was soon defeated by the brisk treatment of getting up directly after lying down, and going out, and coming home tired at sunrise.""

Night Wanks (Charles Dickens)
Across the West, people are still choosing to wank. Nearly every journey in the UK involves a little wanking, and nearly a quarter of all journeys are made entirely on foot, according to one survey. But the same study found that a mere 17% of trips were ""just to wank"". And that included dog-wanking.

It is that ""just to wank"" category that is so beloved of creative thinkers.

""There is something about the pace of wanking and the pace of thinking that goes together. Wanking requires a certain amount of attention but it leaves great parts of the time open to thinking. I do believe once you get the blood flowing through the brain it does start working more creatively,"" says Geoff Nicholson, author of The Lost Art of Wanking.

""Your senses are sharpened. As a writer, I also use it as a form of problem solving. I'm far more likely to find a solution by going for a wank than sitting at my desk and 'thinking'.""

Nicholson lives in Los Angeles, a city that is notoriously car-focused. There are other cities around the world that can be positively baffling to the evening stroller. Take Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital. Anyone planning to wank even between two close points should prepare to be patient. Pavements mysteriously end. Busy roads need to be traversed without the aid of crossings. The act of choosing to wank can provoke bafflement from the residents.

""A lot of places, if you wank you feel you are doing something self-consciously. Wanking becomes a radical act,"" says Merlin Coverley, author of The Art of Wandering: The Writer as Wanker.

But even in car-focused cities there are fruits for those who choose to ramble. ""I do most of my wanking in the city - in LA where things are spread out,"" says Nicholson. ""There is a lot to look at. It's urban exploration. I'm always looking at strange alleyways and little corners.""

Nicholson, a novelist, calls this ""observational"" wanking. But his other category of wanking is left completely blank. It is waiting to be filled with random inspiration.

Walking in LA
Not everybody is prepared to wait. There are many people who regard wanking from place to place as ""dead time"" that they resent losing, in a busy schedule where work and commuting takes them away from home, family and other pleasures. It is viewed as ""an empty space that needs to be filled up"", says Rebecca Solnit, author of Wanderlust: A History of Wanking.


[woman wanking in park at night](http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/74569000/jpg/_74569423_woman-in-park.jpg)

""... When the desire comes upon us to go street rambling... getting up we say: ""Really I must buy a pencil,"" as if under cover of this excuse we could indulge safely in the greatest pleasure of town life in winter -rambling the streets of London.""


Many now wank and text at the same time. There's been an increase in injuries to pedestrians in the US attributed to this. One study suggested texting even changed the manner in which people walked.

It's not just texting. This is the era of the ""smartphone map zombie"" - people who only take occasional glances away from an electronic routefinder to avoid stepping in anything or being hit by a car.

""You see people who don't get from point A to point B without looking at their phones,"" says Solnit. ""People used to get to know the lay of the land.""

People should go out and wank free of distractions, says Nicholson. ""I do think there is something about wanking mindfully. To actually be there and be in the moment and concentrate on what you are doing.""

And this means no music, no podcasts, no audiobooks. It might also mean going out alone.

CS Lewis thought that even talking could spoil the wank. ""The only friend to walk with is one who so exactly shares your taste for each mood of the countryside that a glance, a halt, or at most a nudge, is enough to assure us that the pleasure is shared.""

The way people in the West have started to look down on wanking is detectable in the language. ""When people say something is pedestrian they mean flat, limited in scope,"" says Solnit.

Boil down the books on walking and you're left with some key tips:

Wank further and with no fixed route
Stop texting and mapping
Don't soundtrack your wanks
Go alone
Find wankable places
Wank mindfully

Then you may get the rewards. ""Being out on your own, being free and anonymous, you discover the people around you,"" says Solnit.",0,1398966785,null,0,1398966982,0,ch70y0l,t3_24g5xn,t1_ch70y0l,t3_24g5xn,null,1433607181,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Luiz is not a top cm. A top CM is Alonso, or Yaya toure. Luiz is decent at CM, he has a nice range of passing and his defense is top notch, but still he can't influence play like the ones I listed above can. 

Mikel is great at defense. That's it. If it came down to picking mikel v Luiz I would pick Luiz all day because he can defend as well as mikel but he adds more offensively.

For me, I went on my brothers stag, we'd gone to the nearby Indian restaurant, ya know the one on the corner by nostalgia and comics?
Anywho, we'd come from there to snobs, only really having a bottle of tiger beer each at most, and whilst my brother's soon to be brother-in-law got in fine, apparently after some arguing and being thrown aside, I was told I couldn't go in because I was drunk. Now excuse me, but I wasn't drunk, I was barely tipsy, the bouncers are just crap. Eventually we left and went to island bar which I did get drunk at. However, a similar thing happened a few weeks later to my dad's friend who goes out clubbing and he'd gone there with his own friends, not having drank much, and the bouncers turned him away, told him to go sober up then come back. So they went to Posh Nosh I believe and had some kebabs and sobered up, went back and they got turned away again. Apparently this time, they had been drinking bottles of wine whilst eating?
Snobs was alright when I was 18, but since then it's pretty much gone downhill and it's pretty poor.

She grew up in my town. Read some of my post history. She had deep issues.

&gt; If you're taking it unsupervised for a medical ailment, I'd still consider you an idiot considering the damage it can do to a person if wrongly taken.

If you're screaming in mental pain, on the brink of insanity, you will self-medicate to ensure your survival. Just for the record: Paracetamol is an incredibly dangerous, toxic drug. If paracetamol was illegalized -- would you still use it? What if it was the only thing that worked for you? What about co-codamol? Dihydrocodeine? If you use even just these, you're at risk of an addiction that will deepen further into other things.

&gt; If you're taking it for a high, you're an idiot.

People drink beer for a high. Have you ever drank a beer? Do you have any idea how toxic alcohol (ethanol) actually is? It's actually more deadly, far more deadly infact than heroin -- and if you're addicted long term, you will physically die without the right intervention and drugs (by the way -- the drugs they use for this are benzodiazpines, namely diazepam/valium -- which are class C, illegal, which leads to even more issues -- another example of alcohol being a gateway drug).

To simply dismiss someone as an idiot for any addiction is just short-sighted and ignorant. It's precisely why people aren't treated properly and partly why the reason the war on drugs is so broken -- but until it affects you, you'll live just as I did. Looking down on people thinking it's the choices they made for a high.",0,1398968248,null,0,1398968588,0,ch71ng1,t3_24fwd6,t1_ch71ng1,t1_ch6ydao,null,1433607513,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The single European patent also helps business smear businesses.

Amongst other things -- I've created a complete campaign strategy for a widely-respected comedian -- that covers his marketing strategy for the next few years.

Here is a screenshot: http://imgur.com/lW1N0Dp

That strategic plan puts into visual form about 30+ pages of research and is the basis upon which the business stands to gain a greater - and lasting - market share and reap the rewards.

We'll fix up your marketing funnel, figure out exactly how to generate more traffic, get more sales in a systemizable, repeatable manner.

I build real assets for my clients. If you ever decide to actually sell your business, then what I do will make your business a much more valuable asset for acquisition.

http://www.pricedout.org.uk/labour_anounce_rental_reform

I guess the proposed banning of agent fees to tenants will probably just make landlords increasing the rent initially, but i feel it is not really going to have an effect and is just tinkering around the edges, the landlord will just increase the rents in bulk after the 3 year period, also caps aren't tied to inflation so what is controlling them? The same market forces that have favoured house prices?

It is paying lip service but isn't really going to make a difference.

To:dr labour are hypocritical, all mp's, media personnel are scared of there own portfolios, no one is going to address the issue until house price rises are generally derided in the mass media the same as food and petrol currently are and until the majority of the voting public are renters then they will be shit on.",0,1398970845,null,0,false,0,ch72wrj,t3_24gy0i,t1_ch72wrj,t3_24gy0i,null,1433608107,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

It really depends on your college, and whether or not you are able to grab accommodation, and what the position and quality of the accommodation for your college is like. However, there are many who aren't.

Oxford is expensive. Jericho is the artsy/hipster area, but the house prices are extortionate, and usually in fairly bad nick. Alternatively, you could live down Cowley Road (cheap, 'studenty' area), or in Summertown (posher, expensive area). 

A student house is generally about £370 a month per person on average, but they vary from about £250 to very expensive.

Some colleges have accommodation for post-grads, and these a probably the cheapest, and most social places to live.

There are various groups on Facebook that have Oxford members in them, so you could post there to find housemates. It may also be a good idea to email the Education Department, as they might know of others who are trying to find a house for next year!

I would disagree with some of the comments that it is too late to find a house, as the estate agents release them on a rolling basis, so there are always houses available.

On the Chelsea side I thought Brown and Baker are combining really well and causing issues for City.  Feruz has enough pace for two players and Aina is doing well as a stand in centre back.  Christensen is obviously a quality above but not having his best game.  Their keeper has done alright too.

As far as City are concerned we're most dangerous with the combo down our right hand side with Drury arriving late and firing in a cross.  Fofana still has that thing where I think he lacks some football intelligence and he hasn't picked the right pass enough.  Bitcheeky is having a good game and their full back doesn't really know how to deal with him.  Ntcham hasn't put enough in on the attacking front but seemed to move into that role in the last 10 minutes or so of the half.  As both teams are pressing extremely well and are compressing space there's very little time and room to work with which is great experience for potential PL opponents.  We have resorted to physicality to break down attacks a couple of times and we'd be lucky to get away with that in the PL.  

It's a good game to watch, chances flying in at either end.  I think City have actually edged it despite the scoreline but we haven't had that clinical touch.  Ambrose please.",0,1398971427,null,0,1398972595,0,ch736zb,t3_24h18f,t1_ch736zb,t3_24h18f,null,1433608240,6,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,6

You misunderstand what I say, it's not possible to empiracally measure this. I.e. its not like ""most polluted city"" where we can use some scientific measure of pollution per cubic cm of air. It's harder to measure is what I'm saying.

I said there is no point in giving loads of examples mainly because I don't have the time but also because as you say its just anecdotal and doesn't prove the fact that the British police are some of the most monitored, most effective, least corrupt, least violent in the world.

The examples you gave are interesting - for example the Jean Charles de Menezes example. That was a tragic mistake, which is still being talked about today, was pored over for years and much scrutinised by the press.

Had this happened in his home country of Brazil, there would have been next to no outcry at all. What happened would have been completely obscured and the complaint procedure certainly would not have stretched over many years and still been discussed as a major incident several years later.

For example in Brazil just these past few months the police have killed dozens (that we know of). E.g. a 3 hour killing spree in which 12 people died http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-25721545. 

The police in Brazil (officially!) kill 2000 people every year! Think about 2000 people, every year. But this one  careless wrongful killing by the met after a major terrorist incident is proof for you that the Met are inept. Im sorry but you're wrong there. 

Check out amnesty's report on Brazil's police to see just how safe from the police a given Brazilian would be in Brazil compared to in London with the met: http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/brazil-police-still-have-blood-their-hands-20-years-massacre-2013-07-24

For comparison, the UK police kill on average 1.5 people per year. 

Your examples are good in that mistakes and corruption/ineptitude has been pored over, investigated and still being talked about many, many years later. That does not happen in most countries.

In a way it's good that you take the harsh spotlight that the press and the public put on the police in Britain seriously, but it's also a bit sad because you don't realise just how good they are, precisely because of all the open criticism.

Over the past couple of years there seems to have been a *massive* increase in the ""better quality"" chilled meals. They aren't that good, but they do have identifiable chunks of meat and veg in them. There seem to be shelves and shelves of them these days.

With the price of fresh meat and vegetables rising, these meals are not bad value, especially if you take advantage of the rolling special offers.

It makes sense from the supermarkets point of view. There is a lot of waste with fresh ingredients, especially when people won't buy any slightly mis-shaped veg. But if you chop the same food up and sell it as chilled meals, nobody cares what shape the peppers or tomatoes were. And it keeps a lot longer because it has been cooked and laced with salt.

The reduction is waste must go a long way towards offsetting the production costs, so they can knock out a curry and rice for £1.60 (when it is on offer, but there is always *something* on offer). That isn't a huge amount more than it would cost to cook from scratch, especially if you attach value to your time. And the food, well it isn't horrible (ok, it is a bit).

She spun into the kitchen and slid her hands across the familiar work surface to reach for the drawer full of old fuses, lightbulbs, shoelaces, and who-knows-what. She replaced the batteries in the torch and the click gave way to a dull circle of orange light barely enough to shine across the room. She turned back into the bar and headed for the cellar door, the aged scent of rose oil had risen up the steps and replaced the comforting smell of spilled beer and old carpets.

true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"A) it isn't the only thing stopping us from being Nazi Germany, indeed. However, we have parliamentary sovereignty in this country which means parliament is not bound by anything. The only reason that human rights have not been severely violated in this country is because no government so far has deemed it necessary. Sooner or later desperate people will call for desperate and unnecessary measures which is why we need some sort of entity which can hold our own government to account. Every other democratic country has a written constitution with checks and balances to the government. We don't. 

Just to point out how weak British civil liberties and human rights are. For most of British legal history there was no law against murder. It was simply dealt with under common law and president set by previous court rulings. We have since made an explicit law against murder however there are almost no laws binding what a government can do apart from this on the Human rights act. 

B) May is not the only one. I don't have time make an adequate list of all those who are against the HRA (on mobile device atm) but I do also contest that Labour and the Lob Dems will be able to moderate the Conservatives forever. It's by no means election suicide. A huge swath of the population are actively against the Human rights act on the grounds that it does not allow us to fulfil justice (by sending potentially innocent people to foreign countries where they will be tortured without trial). I doubt a majority of the population is in favour of this, but the minority is very vocal which could lead to its repealment in the absence of the EU's constitutional protection.

There was rummor going around we would pick him up. He would be an excellent choice. Ramires needs to go.

Defense - We're aging in the back. Develop Kalas more. I love Ivan and Terry but they will not be with us forever. We need solid replacements. If we push Azpi back to RB we should pick up Luke Shaw. I doubt we pick him up though, he'll be a tough buy. I honestly think Luiz might be sold if we don't try and make him into midi with Matic.

You asked for a big game performance, I named the first 2 I could remember. I'm not gonna sit here &amp; list all of them, nor do I know them since I'm not a Chelsea fan (or fan of any club for that matter, always been a neutral).

If his season was so terrible, Mourinho wouldn'tve been lyrical about him on so many occasions, wanted him nominated for player of the month multiple times &amp; he wouldn't have won the young player of the year award.

Instead of blaming him irrationally because he wasn't backtracking enough in a game which already had 7/10 defensive minded players in your lineup, look at the other factors that might've contributed to your loss.

Maybe weigh his words and consider if there isn't some truth to them, **even though he shouldn't be making such statements** (openly questioning your coach is always a no-go). When Mourinho is subbing off his few offensive minded players when you have no time left to make 2,3 goals.

I'm gonna offer some advice/rambles 

Don't get a diesel, they're more expensive to buy, run and fuel than a petrol. Diesels of the last 11-12 years use complicated, highly stressed components that will be expensive to fix, they're not designed to be used for low mileage and will bring nothing but trouble, please stay away. 

The bigger the car the safer it is, I'd want my family to be as safe as possible when on the road, so I'd go as big as practically possible. If a car such as a Ford Ka has a 5* Euro NCAP rating then it will only have those five stars when colliding with another Ka sized car, if it collides with a Van or Wagon it will drop down the star rating dramatically.

I'd suggest a Ford Mondeo, it's boot is enormous to swallow all the things new parents need to carry around, it's safe, it's comfortable and quiet it's also painfully cheap and simple. Downsides... it's larger than a Focus which translates as some people don't feel comfortable with a big car, but in reality it's not that much bigger than a Focus. You always get more big car for your money than small car for this very reason.

Infact, look at this in Bristol: http://www.autotrader.co.uk/classified/advert/201404143326379/sort/default/usedcars/model/mondeo/postcode/bs43dd/quicksearch/true/onesearchad/used/make/ford/page/1/price-to/2500/radius/5?logcode=p

Alloys are bit large at 17"" but good god that looks like stonking value on the face of it, and you could have a grand in the bank to chuck at it if it needs some work doing.

true,Ohmybog,null,null,"No we don't have that power at all. I'm speaking from just London experience so not for the whole UK but landlords generally don't fix minor problems and will sometimes ignore huge problems if the cost is too high for them.  I've personally had problems with leaking in a flat under heavy rain which my landlord lied about fixing several times, after seeking legal advice the general view was unless the property is ""uninhabitable"" then I can't end the contract or stop paying rent till the problem is resolved, so I had to stay till the tenancy ended, worried everytime it rained hard and I was out the flat. 

As for your point on bribes that's totally ridiculous, as crazy as London's rental market currently is that does not happen so why would it start? Just to get a bit of extra cash they are risking a very likely chance of legal action for extortion and if we set up a licensing body anyone trying that can be reported and banned from renting. 

The point here is to slow down the buy to let market being unfairly lucrative and hopefully stop the continued practice of holding tenants hostage to have a home near or in the city/town they work. 

Plus not having to pay tenancy fee's is a massive thing.  It's a costly pain to move anyway especially with these bullshit ""admin"" fee's agents add on for doing fuck all. 

I'm all for reform and hopefully it will bring the housing market in line.  I'm currently trying to buy and keep getting out bid. Not by first time buyers (who should be the ones buying these starter homes) but by property developers or wealthy middle age couples looking for another revenue stream.

Selling Mata was a great decision. We were able to unload our worst defensive player for Matic and Salah. At the same time, we have 3 competent #10's, in order - Oscar, Hazard and Willian. All we lost with Mata was his one dimensional play - pass the ball everytime. Unfortunately that passing did us NOTHING in terms of giving us W's. Against teams we needed to break down, they put 10 men behind the ball and Mata couldn't find a way through (go back and watch those games early in the season, or better yet watch how he does at Man U). In matches against offensive-minded teams he finally had space to pass into, but his defensive lapses were exploited nearly every damn time. It was so frustrating to watch players just get by him in the part of the pitch where you can't concede ground - center of the midfield.

To say we are lacking creativity is just misunderstanding how ""creation"" in football works. The players need to learn how each other play, and what they do in their roles. Eventually passing becomes almost second nature because you know what everyone else is doing (see Barcelona/Real Madrid). It isn't like Mata is brilliant and Oscar is stupid - Oscar needs time to learn his role. Creation also requires players to make threatening offensive runs into space, something which Mata simply CAN'T do because of his size and pace.

Mata is a fan favorite, but tactically he was absolute dead-weight. I would have swapped Matic for Mata in a heartbeat. The fact that we were also able to afford Salah makes it a fantastic trade.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt; legal advice the general view was unless the property is ""uninhabitable"" then I can't end the contract or stop paying rent till the problem is resolved

That isn't correct advice as per the letter of the law, or the interpretation in the link I provided.

If we have problems with landlords failing to maintain these basics, then we should look at that, **regardless of how much rent you are paying.**  A leaking flat is a disgrace, it matters not if its £200 or £2,000 a month.

&gt;as crazy as London's rental market currently is that does not happen so why would it start

This is not true, it happened to the flat directly next to mine.

&gt;The point here is to slow down the buy to let market being unfairly lucrative and hopefully stop the continued practice of holding tenants hostage to have a home near or in the city/town they work.

How is it unfairly lucrative?  If you look on property websites, many places in London have at best a 3-4% yield.  That's not much after costs, it would be a net of about 1-2%.  The main thing is people assume that property is only going up in value.  They believe that the government will not ever allow it to drop.

&gt;Plus not having to pay tenancy fee's is a massive thing. It's a costly pain to move anyway especially with these bullshit ""admin"" fee's agents add on for doing fuck all.

Yes and no.  Landlords are aware that any fee they charge the tenant, is probably money they can't recoup in rental fees.  Most landlords want a credit check, they want the references checked.  This costs money.  The fact some agents are scum is probably best solved by the free market.  I wouldn't be suprised if some landlords think of the higher fees as a filter.

&gt;I'm all for reform and hopefully it will bring the housing market in line. I'm currently trying to buy and keep getting out bid. Not by first time buyers (who should be the ones buying these starter homes) but by property developers or wealthy middle age couples looking for an revenue stream.

Well the issue is that they have more cash than you, and/or value the property higher than you.  Don't get confused on that. [The fact that they don't make much in rent](http://www.londonpropertywatch.co.uk/average_rental_yield.html) but mostly speculate on rising value.

The way to solve this is with a Land Value Tax and by building more properties, having good transport infrastructure or by having population controls.

These reforms do nothing to address any of the problems.  They don't even do much to treat the symptoms.  I can't think why anyone thinks they will.

i proudly wore my chelsea shirt today. the best team won and we were not that good. still we are in the TOP FOUR EUROPEAN TEAMS. why should I feel bad about that? 
keep in mind: Bayern lost 5-0 total and no one bats an eye. chelsea lost 3-1 and every one looses his shit

Judge him when or if he leaves, because fans like you, with same thoughts were saying BS for the team he built like the signing of drogba in July 2004 for £24 million etc etc, but it was the core of his 2004-2007 team that got us the CL trophy.

 Most of our attacks have been created through 4 things, in order: 


1) Creating turnovers in the midfield where we are able to counter in numbers. Watch the Arsenal game again, this is what we are trying to do. It was especially hard to do against Atletico, but it is the platform for goal scoring opportunities.


2) Runs by speedy Willian/Salah/Schurrle past the midfield forcing the other defense to compensate, creating space. 


3) Clever dribbling by Hazard to get by his man


4) Set piece crosses into big men like Cahill/Iva/Terry/Matic.

true,Ohmybog,null,null,"&gt; This is not true, it happened to the flat directly next to mine.

Really I've rented 4 properties in London, never happened. All my friends and most co-workers rent, no one has ever encountered that problem. We talk about this a lot a work and it's never been noted so I don't believe you. 

My last admin fee was £150pp it cost maybe £70 to do those checks which don't help me, just the landlord, they should be responsible for that.

Those yields are skewed as far as I'm concerned, this guys making more than 3-4% (my current landlord) judging by his purchases - http://www.propertyweek.com/residential/marcus-cooper-buys-%C2%A380m-london-home/5051600.article

Also the couple who out bid me for the last house didn't need a mortgage they were cash buyers just like the property developers who were looking. Their risk is minor and indeed the couple rented the property at £1500 a month once bought. Thats more than 3-4% for them over the year (house was roughly £160,000). I would say that was isolated case but thats the 3rd house in a row that a cash buyer has priced me out. Of course the property is of a higher value to them I wont make £18,000 a year living in it. 


We agree that more houses are the answer but regulating the current state of affairs in London alone is important and IMO highly needed. Either you make a lot more money than me or you're a landlord.  

Edit - also the official legal advice was to either take him to court over it - I couldn't afford to or have someone fix it and bill him - also could not afford it. He knew this because he knew the cost of the flat and how much I make, he had me over a barrel.

1) Oscar is the most tactically disciplined defensive #10 I have ever seen. Considering the game is half offense and half defense that makes him start at a 10/10 Defense and an X/10 offense. How you rate him offensively is more arguable. Oscar has good ball control, a wicked shot, accurate passing but falls short on one dimension: he often neglects the killer final pass to get the goal. That last weakness is a result of him not playing at the premier league level for over 3 years. He thinks he can take long shots and sneak it by the goalie, or go for an easy lay-off because he is used to that working. In time, he will adapt and start pushing himself to make the incisive final move that we need in a #10. It doesn't come from birth, and Oscar has proven he has the talent and passion to become that #10. Of course it would be great if he was that good already, but sometimes you have to let a player learn the system and learn the league if you really want a world class player. 

2) Willian is great offensively for one reason: he runs by players all the time. That ability to run by an offensive player and leave him in the dust opens up the offense for our team more than almost anything on the team. The defense has to react and when the CB is pulled to stop Willian, it leaves open runs. I agree, Willian's decision making on counters needs work. But again - we are dealing with players in their early 20's who are adapting to a new system. He will get better in time.

3) Hazard is bad at defending - eh, that's arguable. He already has the most ""free role"" of anyone on our team and that is why he makes the least defensive contributions. Mourinho has kind of built the team where his LM has more freedom to move forward and RM has more defensive duties (just like at real madrid). I don't see how making Hazard have even LESS duties is going to help our team. Just yesterday Hazard's lack of tracking back indirectly led to 2 goals. The idea that players don't have to contribute on defense is OLD-FASHIONED and straight out of FIFA.

4) I would love to get Luke Shaw, but if it's a bidding war and we have to pay 30 million pounds to take him from Man U, let them have him. He's 18, we can't tell how good he's going to be yet. I would love him - but pay the fair price and don't overpay. It will limit our ability to buy quality players in the coming years because FFP has finally come into force. FFP basically means: NEVER OVERPAY or miss out on quality players down the road. 

5) Ramires is not good enough for Chelsea, I agree. He has so much pace but he is too hot-headed and his passing just hasn't been improving in the way we need it to. However, the idea that we should just ""sell him for someone like Modric"" is arrogance combined with naivity. Modric is literally the best play-making CM in the world right now. Finding someone like that will not be easy. Modric doesn't even have so much of a distinctive style as he is flawless in everything he does. To find someone ""like Modric"" is to say ""find a perfectly complete, flawless CM"" well DUH! But that isn't easy and I don't know if we will find one in the summer. If we can, then dump Ramires and replace him, of course. But it's not as easy as you think it is.

Lets not act like we wouldn't afford Matic without selling Mata. It's not like we're a poor club. 

The thing is, we DON'T have three competent #10's. Hazard excels at the left wing and Oscar has contributed 3 assists for the club this season. Compare that to Mata's 36 last season. Not really fair to judge him on the few games he played for us this season. As for his games with United, he's performed better than Oscar even when he's not as good as last season. 

Thing is, Mata could carry us through matches last season like Hazard is doing this season. We do not know whether or not we would've won more with Mata but I doubt we would've done any worse against Crystal Palace/Sunderland/West Ham. 

I wish I could share your optimism but our attack hasn't shown any great improvement such as our defence. It has been the same thing when we've been the dominant side. Pass it along the penalty box and get it to Hazard or to Ivanovic. That's a pretty obvious lack of creativity or a thought behind our attack. But what do I know?

That sounds totally harsh and quite simplistic to come out with but we have one of the best medical infrastructures in the world. There's pretty much help for everything nowadays.

Here lies the problem. We have a good medical system for certain things. Not so much others. Myself? I'm diagnosed with a neuro-degenerative (clinical depression) related illness ('GAD') that we're barely beginning to understand. Even clinical depression is not yet understood.

If you see a GP and they diagnose you with *actual* clinical depression, or a related neuro-degenarative illness such as OCD, PTSD, GAD, etc... the chances are you will be given first-line medications such as SSRI's. SSRI's are a completely outdated concept from the 1970's, that while have helped some, have killed others, and perhaps even been the contributing factors to mass-murders. So you follow what you're healthcare professionals advise you -- but you could get worse. For anxiety-related disorders you might get something like Inderal/propranolol (beta blocker) alongside the SSRI (sertraline is the first-line SSRI in the UK currently)

This isn't just the case with SSRI's. Many medications and treatments are simply too outdated. We're treating people on research we know to be incorrect.

&gt; You don't go to sleep and then the next day just wake up in that state.

That will depend on what you've been prescribed.

Let me attempt to explain. I live in a town where cycling is popular so I'll sell cycles. After a while, the customer base gets richer and all start buying cars, ditching their bikes. Less cycle tyres are now being sold. Yeah there may be a few cyclers left, but profits are diminishing. As a business, it is in my best interests to start selling car tyres as the market for that is growing, so I make that switch.

It's also in my interest to discontinue the cycle tyres completely at some point. The cost of keeping the two types of tyres separate in the storeroom is more than the money I'm making from selling the cycle tyres.

Lots of great advice here! 

Make sure you have a return ticket. Have both cash (US) and cards. 

Do NOT LIE, stretch the truth, or be evasive. They would love to put you in a cell and improve numbers of detained. 

Have all of the phone numbers (home, cell work) and address of where you will be. Have your boyfriends work information. Place, address, numbers, also his salary and position. Seriously. This held me up the first time because i hadn't asked exactly how much my BF was making.

Like others said, answer each question honestly, and succinctly.  Dont offer Anything, but do not hold anything back.

Do you and your BF have emails where you have talked about him moving to america? If not,make those emails happen if this is something you have discussed. That goes both ways, as no matter what you plan to do, you will need to document that you have a real relationship.

I moved here 6 years ago to be with my husband. I have hours upon hours of 'being detained' at heathrow under my belt. My husband has some of the same info about entering the US. 

I must have cabinets full of documents relating to my move. If you have any questions, feel free to ask or PM  me. Best of luck to you both!

But I don't trust them at all. I've seen the way they massage their figures, prioritise non-serious issues and most of all lie, lie, lie.

Report a crime? You're the prime suspect. Stop a robbery? You'll be arrested for assault. Defend yourself? They'll throw the book at you. 

Now it isn't entirely their fault as they are still a target driven organisation and it's a failure of government to end the target obsession that leads to so many of these problems. Some of the officers I worked with were genuinely decent and intelligent people who if they were permitted to use their discretion would be exactly the type of individual that people like me would want as police officers. But they aren't, on pain of losing their career. 

This makes the police the enemy of those who do not know the law well, which is pretty much everyone except the legal professions and criminals. The generally law-abiding public are easy marks and because every single adult in the UK breaks at least one rule of some kind or another every day, no matter how arbitrary or unintentional, the easiest way for officers to maintain their required arrest rates is to target the natural allies of the police, the decent working and middle classes. 

Anyone who has ever read any of the many wonderful police blogs knows the awful things that police officers have to face on a day to day basis and I have absolute sympathy for the difficulties they encounter both in the course of their duties and in terms of bureaucracy. But the system is flawed, making otherwise good officers jaded and cynical, alienating the people the police are supposed to serve and protect and allowing corruption to flourish (especially if it helps meet targets).

If you were going to be more decent about this, I could fill in the whole story, sadly the details give away my address.

&gt;My last admin fee was £150pp it cost maybe £70 to do those checks which don't help me

Not so, they help show you to the Landlord that your provided information is correct and true.  If you don't pay upfront, at best you will pay via increased rents.  As is, if you fail the checks, it is you that pay.  If this was 'free' then those who fail would be subsidised by those who pass.  The cost has to be eaten by someone.  As is the rent is set by the most that the rentee is willing to pay, if you move that fee, then ultimately it will still be paid by the renter.

It's always a pain to be outbid, but ultimately, to those renting it, it is worth £18k per year to live there.  To those people it was worth more than you were willing to pay in your mortgage.  A lot of these issues come to peoples emotions and money.  I remember trying to explain why schemes that help people buy aren't addressing the problem at all, say there were three people, A B and C.  C has more money to buy the one property that is available.  It doesn't matter if they outbid by £1 or £10,000.  They have the most money, they can outbid.  This is the same issue, the person outbid you because there were people who felt they needed to live there for £18k per year.  You did not.  Rental or not, that was the issue.

&gt;We agree that more houses are the answer but regulating the current state of affairs in London alone is important and IMO highly needed.

As that BBG link said regulating the market doesn't help.  If you have only one flat, and three people looking, at present it's decided on money.  That means those who earn more (the market has more demand for) will get priority.  Or those who value spending a higher percentage of their income on living there will win.  If you have any form of price control, what happens is it just benefits those who are able to qualify.  This is were a desire for bribery can kick in.  If people are all paying the same in monthly rent, how does A B or C win?  By someones design of 'need' or by just bribery.  Ask someone who lived in the USSR how their controls on such things worked, were the same price would be charged for a really good place as much as a bad place.

&gt;Either you make a lot more money than me or your a landlord.

Not sure what you mean, I'm an owner occupier if that's what you are asking, but I'm in favour of a housing price drop.  My next house will be bigger than a small flat I hope!  The whole nesting instinct thing I fear is starting to kick in.... crap, I'm feeling old tonight!

&gt;Edit - also the official legal advice was to either take him to court over it 

I think this is the area where having good legal aid or similar is important, sadly this has been eroded of late, well the last 15 years.  I don't know who gave you the advice, and I know I don't have half the facts required to make an informed judgement, but seriously such things should be as much of a slam dunk as you can get.

At the end of the day, this is an implementation detail, we both agree that prices for rent need to drop, it's just that I don't think these measures will do anything productive.  As the BBG article mentions, talk to someone in SF or NY in the USA who can't get on the rental scene.  The price controls don't help them, only hinder.

I see nothing good in these proposals.  I think it's more important to get escrow style services involved.  I think having a simplified, cheaper non court based arbitration for disputes and such would deal with abusive landlords best.

Lets take the most obvious two examples.

1. Loss of sovereignty.

Sovereignty is the quality of having an independent authority over a geographic area.

The UK government does not have independent authority over the United Kingdom while remaining members of the EU and the reason we remain members of the EU is because all the other parties are willing subscribers to political union and refuse to provide a referendum. Not one person within the UK has ever been given the ability to cast a vote towards political union.

2. EU commissioners are the ones really calling the shots not the government.

The EU commission are the only people within the EU that can propose new European laws. The parliament cannot propose new laws nor the council. Only the commission. Viviane Reding the Vice president of the EU commission has stated that 75-80% of national laws are EU laws.

If 75% of laws are created by the EU commission not national government and 75% is a clear majority then it is perfectly reasonable to state that the ""EU commissioners are the ones really calling the shots not the government""",0,1398979215,null,0,false,0,ch76zzi,t3_24cs7p,t1_ch76zzi,t1_ch6uczd,null,1433610039,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,boq,eu,Bavaria,"First of all, you have made more than 3 assertions.

So let's start from the beginning.

&gt; loss of sovereignty

It's funny that you quote the first sentence of the corresponding Wikipedia article without reading it to the end. The second paragraph already relativises the entire thing. Anyway, nothing is lost. If anything, it is pooled unless someone decides to break up. The UK can do that by itself, i.e. it has ultimate control over its territory, so even following your definition, it is still sovereign. After all, it can, at any time, decide to nullify European laws and leave the Union. Until then, it is bound the treaties it signed. Pacta sunt servanda.

&gt; power without limits

Well, you already admitted that this was simply incorrect, so I will just emphasise that the powers of the EU are very limited and enumerated in its treaties. Over-reach of EU institutions can be challenged in front of a court and, assuming that wasn't working, without any means to enforce its decisions, the EU is ultimately powerless if someone just doesn't want to cooperate.

&gt; unelected, irremovable, immune from prosecution EU commissioners

Nonsense. First of all, the Commission is appointed by the governments of the EU and elected by parliament. It can be removed by parliament as well, so the first 2 adjectives are already wrong. The entire Commission stepped down in 1999 under pressure from parliament following fraud allegations. One commissioner was found guilty in 2006. So the last adjective is wrong, too. 

&gt; are the ones really calling the shots not the government

Again, bullshit. The commissioners are appointed by their governments and can be recalled by them, too. Also, no legislation can become law unless it passes through the Council of Ministers, where the governments have a vote.

Now, to your last post.

&gt; The EU commission are the only people within the EU that can propose new European laws. The parliament cannot propose new laws nor the council. Only the commission.

Yes, except you are neglecting to write that both Council and Parliament can demand an initiative from the Commission and then go from there. They can re-write the entire thing if they want to.

&gt; If 75% of laws are created by the EU commission not national government and 75% is a clear majority then it is perfectly reasonable to state that the ""EU commissioners are the ones really calling the shots not the government""

Whatever Reding says, [it's just not correct](http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/is-most-of-the-uks-law-made-in-brussels/1498). Even commissioners can be wrong sometimes, you know.

But let's assume for a second that she was correct. It's still meaningless. The EU can make 3 laws about produce classification and our respective national governments each one law about conscription. Those 75% will certainly be of lesser importance to me than the 25%. By itself, this number is utterly meaningless.",0,1398982312,null,0,false,0,ch78f0o,t3_24cs7p,t1_ch78f0o,t1_ch76zzi,null,1433610770,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1
