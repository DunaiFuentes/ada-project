compare a high street to a supermarket in terms of the social experience, a supermarket you might bump into someone you know and chat for a bit but you're standing, people are trying to get past with trolleys etc, everyone's in a rush, it's just inconvenient, you go to the till, meet one of the 30 cashiers who work that position who are never around long enough for you to get familiar with, who are made to rattle off a set spiel and have all these rules and standards they have to work to and clearly dislike the job, effectively tiny cogs in a huge machine.

contrast this to a high street, you have a big open area, usually benches and places to sit, cafes, sometimes pubs, street entertainers and stalls now and then, you can take your time, sit about and chat to folk you know (or dont, at times), stop for a tea/coffee/lunch or just sit down for a minute while you think what you need to get. you go into the shops and there are probably 2-4 people who work in any one position, so if you go in there regularly they get to know you and chat to you or become friends even, they dont have all the rules either and usually are working much more on common sense, ie probably enjoy their job a lot more (i know i did when in a small business). it's just an all round more pleasant experience imho, if you have the time ofcourse (and i think this is a big reason why people dont do it much now), having worked on a high street before you can tell there are a lot of old folk who's main form of socialising is just ambling about the street, some younger folk as well and a fair few middle aged people too.",0,1406515443,null,0,false,0,cj9nzc2,t3_2brmsl,t1_cj9nzc2,t1_cj8925a,null,1434933249,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Some thoughts about the game:

- Sterling's goal was magic, obviously.
- Markovic looked pretty good. Admittedly I'm rewatching the game on TV right now and he doesn't look as sharp. But I got to see his positioning and off-the-ball movement which the camera missed, and it was good. I think once he beds in fully he's going to be fucking lethal.
- Oh, Glen Johnson. I've defended him rigorously in the past, but I can't cover for him today. He was poor. I really hope this is just preseason cobwebs.
- Skrtel was a gottang rock.
- Martin Kelly got burned pretty bad a couple times but I can see him growing into the fullback role.
- Jordan Ibe can be really good, but he needs a lot more competitive minutes to do that. I don't think he's going to be much use to us this season, but I think a good loan deal will let him light it up.
- When Gerrard gets ready to take a set piece the feeling in the crowd is simply *electric*.

I never understood what's wrong with calling it simply Gaming or Pro Gaming? I just worry that by trying to shoe horn it into a sport people will see e-sports as an alternative to traditional physical sports and exercise.

If you can't afford it just wait, buying a ton of merch doesn't make you a better fan. There's this recent push to buy kits from weird Chinese sellers for some reason.

To answer your question:

Aliexpress *is* foreign and has questionable reliability.

Some sellers are better than others. My wife buys leggings and shit on Aliexpress and shipping to us is sometimes 2-4 weeks. There's no real return policy in place.

Gogoalshop.com is Thai and the kits are knock offs. They're either fake kits or ""fake"". I mean the new home kit for $39.99... They're fake, your mileage may vary in terms of quality. Some people have better luck than others but that's the way it is with sellers like these. Our Sunday team ~~might have~~ bought shirts from them, quality was passing but you could tell when you were wearing them that they were fake.

If for some other reason you want to buy from somewhere else my recommendations are:

[Kitbag](http://www.kitbag.com/stores/kitbag/default.aspx)

[Sports Direct](http://www.sportsdirect.com/)

[Subside Sports](http://www.subsidesports.com/uk/catalog/category/view/id/345/mode/list/)

Kits are real, Sports Direct does sales throughout the season and you're likely to get a kit on the cheap.

That's in a lot of other sports. Speaking from an American perspective, in pretty much every sport over here every team has a rival. 

If you are speaking about some sort of fanatical hate that you dislike, I get that. But if it's just the fact that a part of club culture is to have a rivalry/dislike for another team...that's just a part of sport, not just football.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"**No**, I really doubt it. This idea that there is a middle road where Scots can stay in the UK but somehow get more representation is a dead end in my opinion. They may get more control over areas that only affect them (like taxation and certain government spending north of the border)... but they aren't going to get more control over UK wide issues and 'federalism' is very much a dirty word in the UK in a similar way to how 'socialism' is a dirty word in the USA. The choice in Scotland is between staying as they are, or going - and that is how voters should accept it. 

These debates always make me think of **[this](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/multimedia/archive/00117/UKpopulation_117945c.jpg)** (it's a map of the UK redrawn by population density). The sad reality is people like myself in the incredibly densely populated South of England aren't going to let power slip north of the border. I'd sooner see the Scots try and go it alone than have to enter into some sort of federal system with them. Inb4 *""Federalism works really well in Germany""*... well, [this is partly why](http://www.viewsoftheworld.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/germany_density.jpg) (another density map this time of Germany)... as you can see, their population is much more evenly distributed geographically, and each major region has its own major conurbations.

The bottom line is, figures this week showed 80% of the UK economy (and the ONLY part to exceed pre-recession levels) is made up by the services sector, which is largely located in the Middle and Southern (geographical) half of England... which also makes up something like 65% of the population... and those people just aren't going to see their livelihoods threatened by Scots delusions of grandeur.

Personally, I can't wait till the referendum is done, because either way the Scots are going to lose out... if they vote to stay they will then have to suffer a taste of austerity which they have largely avoided until now (probably cleverly executed under the auspices of ""further devolution"")... the alternative is they vote to leave, in which case;

* 1) They pretty much just guaranteed a Conservative government in England in 2015 who will be elected on a ticket of *""don't give an inch""* negotiating, by a jilted British public. 
* 2) Business north of the border will be in a flight to relocate their tax base to England 
* 3) And the City of London will be in open hunting season to asset strip anything they think they can get away with from the Scots

And inb4 ""But a successful Scotland will be the rUKs best interest""... you're right, it might in the long term. But the City of London is notoriously short-termist, if they sense an opportunity to make a quick profit at the expense of a politically turbulent Scotland they will take it.

- From experience of driving LHD when on holiday, the biggest difference for me is looking at the rearview mirror instictively. You get used to it after a day though.

- We have a lot of stationary speed cameras, but they're always signposted and are painted bright yellow. If you get flashed by one in a hire car, the company will charge you based on your retained credit card details. Motorways don't have these speed cameras, but there are plenty of police around who do spot speed checks. The limit there is 70mph, but typically the police won't bother anyone doing 80 unless they're in a bad mood.

Walking into a Michelin starred restaurant as your first job in the UK just doesn't happen anymore... and tips of 15-20 an hour is extremely unusual. If you work in a mid-level quality chain like say Las Iguanas or La Tasca you could expect tips of maybe £20-30 a night averaged out, although these might get pooled and shared with the kitchen staff to. I've not heard of many waiting staff that can consistently pull down tips like that.

The reality is the work the will find here will be a in a chain pub like a Greene King, or a budget hotel like Premier Inn or Ibis Budget, and they will earn the minimum wage... it's a hard grind and they'll bring home £12-14K per year which won't get very far at all, and it certainly won't go as far as getting back to the Czech Republic when they decide to leave.

If they stick it out for 2-3 years they might then be able to push up into £14-15k territory, but the waiting and hotel services industry has a pretty hard pay ceiling around £17k which is hard to break through unless you go into really niche stuff like Michelin/Silver service places which will expect to see a very high standard of professionalism and skill.

I would pick up a copy of the [Highway Code](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Official-Highway-Code-Department-Transport/dp/0115528148). It's what new drivers in the UK have to learn and take a test on. It will help you get your head around driving on the left.

The gearbox is mirrored, so the stick is on your left and you use your left hand. Different cars use different specific gearboxes but most use a design [like this](http://info.ipass-edinburgh.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Manual-Car-Gear-Stick-iPass-Driving-School-Edinburgh.jpg). The pedals on the floor go in the order (from left to right) Clutch, Break, Accelerator. Your left foot is for the Clutch only and your right foot is for the Break and Accelerator pedals. 

The exact type of car will depend on what you want. Most rental places offer popular cars - like the Peugeot 208 or Vauxhall Astra. Remember, roads in the UK (especially roads around Truro in Cornwall) are very small by comparison to some other places so I would avoid a large car if you are driving on the left for your first time. 

Don't use your mobile phone (even to text) while you drive and don't speed - there are cameras EVERYWHERE and you'll get caught very quickly. Most of the major motorways now have ""average speed check"" cameras which identify your car as you join the motorway and then again as you leave, then calculate your average speed to determine if you've been speeding. You are (for some bizarre reason) allowed to smoke. Don't have open alcohol containers in the car and if you eat or drink at the wheel you can expect to get pulled over and possibly fined by the police. If you do get stopped by the police be polite to them and just explain you are new to British roads and are sorry. Don't be rude to them and if they ask you for any information like your passport give it to them and don't lie.

They will not perform any disruptive investigation (drilling into walls, pulling off plaster to inspect the condition of masonry, etc.). You would need to seek out a specialist firm to do that kind of investigation, and it would cost a LOT.

In the UK, nobody really cares about the physical soundness of a structure.

In fact, it's generally cheaper to drive in the UK than it is to catch a train. Especially once you can take a second passenger in the car.

On some routes the train will get you there faster, some won't.

I'll do a quick example. I live in Cambridge, and I have friends in South Croydon (far South London).

A quick look at a train fare: £27.00 off-peak return (£38.60 for travel and return at any time), journey time is about 90minutes station-to-station (not door-to-door).

According to Google, the drive time would be about 120minutes, and cost £30 in fuel. But remember that journey is door-to-door, and I can take passengers, and travel at any time of day. Also, I know that my car will probably cost less than £30 in fuel for that journey. Of course there's also wear and tear + insurance, my time, etc.

That was an issue with management though really. Moyes didn't care about the youth system, and it goes to show in the players we had coming through.

Martinez has taken a completely different approach, and is looking at the Southampton system, where a singular philosophy is evident throughout the entire club, and will allow players to develop naturally through all the youth levels.

This requires a very hands on approach, and it seems Martinez is happy to do this- and has hired Old Joe as his right hand man to make sure his messages and philosophies are being received down to schoolboy level. 

&gt;this whole ""potential"" malarkey is just a hype machine designed for us to request big money if a club wants one of our so called ""wonderkids"" then we are no better than United with their academy.

If our academy was 50% of what Man Utd's is, then I would be over the moon. 

I don't know what you are on about also, teams don't spend big money on young players because of 'hype' they do so because they are skilled, well trained and their extensive scouting has shown them to have potential to succeed in their system.

You are mental if you think teams are shelling out money based on what newspapers are saying.

Naturally, it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value, but unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this.

When you pay into a pension, it's designed to be like you're paying in *before tax*, otherwise you get taxed twice (you pay income tax when withdrawing it). For a basic rate taxpayer, this is done automatically. For every £100 you put in, the government then send on an extra £25 to your pension provider. If you're a higher rate taxpayer though, they don't do anything else. You're then entitled to claim back £25 which they give directly to you.

Call up HMRC and talk to them about it. If the total owed to you is under £1k (iirc) then they can adjust your tax code so you get it through your payslip, if over you have to write them a simple letter. They'll also adjust your tax code so you're not overpaying in the future (so each month you'll get £25 more in your paycheque if you're paying in £100). There's a limit to how long you can leave it, I think 5 years.

Germany may have a functioning federal system, and power may be evenly distributed around population but look at the US or Spain for that matter. Economic and political power is largely concentrated around economic and political centres and regions and states with their own history and cultural identity. Indeed Scotland was one off the oldest nation states in Europe. 

Scotland has also been shown to have a higher GDP per capita than the rest of the UK, and an economy as you rightly point out that is more flexible and evenly spread than the London centric services based economy that almost sunk the UK in 2008/9 due to its lopsided nature. Meanwhile, what impact would a further lurch to the right in British politics and a UK withdrawal from the EU have on an independent Scotland?

true,phys1cs,null,null,"&gt;Research from Cornell University suggests it is considerably dirtier than coal

Not exactly. It suggests that the climate impact per MJ of heat produced is 20-100% greater for shale gas on a 20 year timescale and similar on a 100 year timescale. Since the UK's gas power stations are typically 55% efficient compared to coal at 35% (assuming similar operating regimes), that would translate to shale gas being between 23% less damaging and 27% more damaging over 20 years per unit of electricity, and close to 36% better over 100 years. Hardly anyone uses coal for heating in the UK (for very good environmental reasons, as well as convenience/price) so there wouldn't be any substitution there anyway.

You're also using a very narrow definition of the word 'dirty'. Although climate change is certainly a concern, the vast majority of the harm caused by fossil fuels over the past 200 years and expected over the next 50 years is a result of the other stuff - SOx, NOx, particulates, heavy metals etc, and coal is far worse for all of these things. These are the things that are killing people, at a rate of hundreds of thousands per year. 

Coal mining is also far more dangerous than any kind of gas extraction, and causes a lot more damage to the environment. Even the worst postulated impacts of shale gas extraction (including earthquakes and polluted water) are nothing compared to the harm to people and the environment caused by coal mining on a routine basis. 

The political left in particular seems to have  a massive blind spot when it comes to coal, but it really is horrible stuff. Shale gas is pretty terrible compared to clean alternatives, but it's nowhere near as bad as coal, even including the climate effects of methane leaks.",0,1406540986,null,0,false,0,cj9vxyj,t3_2bxf6i,t1_cj9vxyj,t1_cj9vjrx,null,1434937055,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

true,Kesuke,null,null,"I really don't think it will work out like that at all. And I would dispute several of your points;

&gt; **Scotland has also been shown to have a higher GDP per capita than the rest of the UK**

That isn't strictly the case, and has been disputed by a lot of different sources. The answer is, nobody really agrees about what would constitute Scottish GDP - and then on top of that it is unclear what the costs of independence would be on Scottish GDP.  Most sources variously agree that Scotland only has a higher per capita income if it has a geographical share of oil included in its GDP... but most also agree that geographical share of oil profit is not necessarily a foregone conclusion. Indeed the oil industry may geographically be based near Scotland, but it was developed with money from London. The Scots may find themselves having to negotiate parts of that away in order to obtain important concessions elsewhere over other issues like currency.

&gt; **It would also become the most privileged location on the British Isles for businesses exporting their goods and services into Europe**

I entirely disagree with this. Did you know, 75% of all goods entering the UK and about 50% of exports actually go via the docks just at Southampton alone. Most of the remainder go via other English ports or the Channel Tunnel. There are two major gas interconnectors traveling to Europe - the Bactang-Balzung/Bactang Zeebrugge-interconnectors and two major electricity interconnectors - the Anglo-french and Brit-NED connectors... all of which bar one travel via England. The **tl;dr** is that if the Scots want to connect to European markets, then they'll be doing it via the rUK, on rUK terms... even more so if Scotland doesn't automatically get EU membership. You only have to look at a map to see how isolated Scotland is in Europe geographically, and for them to profitably export to Europe they are going to have to make big savings elsewhere in their operations to accommodate transportation costs. Ironically, one area where geographical proximity is less important is the services industry, but the UK (and even European) services industry is so totally domination by London that just isn't going to happen.

&gt; **London centric services based economy that almost sunk the UK in 2008/9 due to its lopsided nature**

I don't really agree with this. We have a services focused economy, but it's unfair to bash the UK services industry (of which finances is only a part) for a recession that was ultimately caused by US sub-prime mortgage lenders... and then fail to credit the UK services industry for the fact it makes up 80% of our entire economy (whilst oil makes up about 5%) and is the only part of our economy to exceed pre-recession levels. By extension, it is THE reason the [UK has the fast growing economy](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/10988849/UK-has-fastest-growing-economy-International-Monetary-Fund-says.html) of any developed nation in the world.

true,the_ultravixens,null,null,"Right, I work in oil and gas and energy security and aspects of fracking is kind of a pet interest of mine, so I'd like to set a few things straight regarding both the tech and the wider energy context.

Firstly, the assumption that this legislation means that the north of england will look like [this](http://slowdownfracking.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/landscape1.jpg) is not a sure thing.  Firstly, this is because nobody yet even knows if shale gas drilled in the north west is even economically or technically viable.  Various news sites hurl around figures for however many years of gas we *might* have.  This is them using the *resource* number, which merely is an estimate of gas in place in the rock.  We should be more interested in *reserves*, which is how much you can actually get out at **current prices**.  Unfortunately the media frequently conflate the two words, which have different meanings, which adds to confusion.  Since hardly any test wells have been drilled, nobody yet knows what potential flow rates or recoverability might be.  The geology in that region is very different that that of say North Dakota in the US.  The shale is highly faulted and fractured, which is less than ideal for drilling.  I certainly think it more likely that the area won't be highly productive.  We also don't have anywhere near the rigs or the expertise in drilling in this country that they do in the US.  It would take quite a long time to ramp up production.

Secondly, it's important to look at this rush for shale gas in the wider energy context, both of UK energy security and globally.  UK north sea production of oil and gas [peaked](http://www.oilandgasuk.co.uk/cmsfiles/assets/1714.jpg) a few years ago, and is now in fairly steep decline at about 5% a year.  Around a decade ago the UK was self sufficient in oil and gas, this is no longer the case.  Since our politicians are short-termist idiots, we don't have any bilateral long term trade agreements in place to access gas at a set price.  Instead we have to pay market spot prices to get our gas (woo free markets!), which means we're at the mercy of market forces.  Natural gas prices in Europe are [steadily rising](http://gailtheactuary.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/natural-gas-prices-in-us-europe-japan.png), as various other producers peak and supplies become more volatile.  Both oil and gas extraction prices are rising at a few % a year (10% give or take for oil, I don't exactly know for gas, but it likely tracks oil closely).  This is because much of the 'easy' oil and gas has gone, and the harder to reach stuff obviously costs more to extract.  This is a long term trend which is not going to reverse itself.

The UK needs gas, and we're going to need more of it as our own production levels decline.  Currently we get a lot from Norway, but they seem likely to [peak soon](http://fractionalflow.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/fig-1-norsk-naturgass-prognose-2013-til-2020.png), and then we'll have to look elsewhere or pay more.  Fortunately UK [domestic electricity consumption](http://blog.comparemysolar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/UK-domestic-electricity-consumption.png) appears to have peaked and is declining (largely due to energy price signals since 2005 I expect, serving both to reduce demand and encourage increasing efficiency).  However, many of our coal plants are ageing, and will by closing due to climate change policy dictating energy policy.  We're installing much more wind, but presently we lack any grid-scale storage mechanism for when the wind's not blowing.  As such we'll need lots of gas turbines to cycle on and off to maintain baseline when the wind isn't blowing, or else blackouts by around 2020 would be increasingly likely.  Adding wind power is basically a way of adding random noise into the grid, making it more difficult and expensive to operate and increasing the likelihood of grid failure.

So against this context, I can understand why some politicians might really, really hope there's a ton of nice economic shale gas we can frack.  I don't think the tories are evil and deliberately want to drill in people's gardens and cackle as their friends in top hats make money.  There might be an element of that, but I think there's also some rather brutal pragmatism, since who wants to be buying all their gas from Russia.  Personally I think that the interest in UK fracking is a relatively scary development as regards our future energy security, as frankly it's a really low quality resource, and if we're going after that then it's not a good sign.

Similarly, I have a lot of sympathy with anti-fracking groups.  It's not a nice process and has many negative environmental effects (though I feel most anti-frack campaigners *way* overstate some of these, which really damages their credibility).  However I don't think that the majority of them are making these decisions with a full understanding of the energy predicament we find ourselves in.  They may dislike drilling rigs in their backyard, but they like fridges, televisions, plastic goods and cars.  Presently these things are powered and produced by drilling *elsewhere*.  It's part of the deep hypocrisy that many people expect to be entitled to functioning systems and services, but refuse to countenance being inconvenienced by being affected by a small fraction of the negative consequences that their lifestyle *inevitably* entails.  Up until now we've been able to have our cake and eat it by basically exporting and ignoring externalities, that's no longer an option.

""He has all the attributes to be one of the best left-backs in the Premier League. He’s a threat when he goes forward and defensively he's very difficult to beat.

1) It be nice if we had another form of infastructure (literally millions, of metal containers full of water being heated by burning gas) to heat our homes and other spaces. We don't. Gas is not optional.


2) North sea reserves contary to the SNP's ravings have allmost certainly passed peak a while back. We can barely supply our needs day by day.


3) Lot of the major gas suppliers, are either unstable gulf city states which might just turn into a bloodbath at very little notice, or Russia. Not to mention, but whilst pipeline contracts are slightly more stable (lol Russian agression). Liquid gas transport ships can essentially be 'outbid' in transit. Again, We can barely fulfill our needs as is. 


4) No mass alternative to gas power (which we also use HUGE amounts of) or heating, is going to be deployable in a time frame not unlike a decade. However great your option of choice it, nuclear, solar, wind, tidal. Deployment time is the utter contary of trivial. Even going full blast from tomorrow, without a descent cheap supply of gas in the country our shit gets fucked. Quickly. 

So, whilst it be nice if we did not have to exploit every available resource, thats not the world we live in.

true,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,"Good analysis; I agree with all of that.

Particularly agree with Mason... not only was his passing good, he continually got himself into positions to receive balls back.  He was constantly doing little jogs around the pitch to find space between midfield and defence.  There was a lot more space in this game than there will be in any EPL match, but it's definitely something I've found Paulinho and Dembele wanting in last season, which led to a lot of pressure on our backs not being able to distribute the ball effectively.

And I agree about Eriksen too... he has looked very average.  Considering he wasn't at the World Cup, there's no real excuse for him to be as lethargic as he's been in these games, particularly only playing 45 mins at a time.

I worry, like this article says, that he doesn't have the physical attributes to really thrive under Poch.  Holtby has the energy and enthusiasm, but not the cultured skills; Eriksen has the skills, but not the energy.  Hopefully there's a way of accommodating him, and having high energy players around him might give him the space and passing options he needs to be truly effective.  But I do wonder if Poch has been playing Lamela in a roaming CAM role this tour to see if he can be an option instead of Eriksen instead of playing them both together?

Iron Dome -  The system is designed to intercept and destroy short-range rockets and artillery shells fired from distances of 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) to 70 kilometres (43 mi) away and whose trajectory would take them to a populated area.  On 10 March 2012, The Jerusalem Post reported that the system shot down 90% of rockets launched from Gaza that would have landed in populated areas  ""lack of Israeli casualties suggests Iron Dome is the most-effective, most-tested missile shield the world has ever seen.""

With regards to genocide, I would consider any concerted effort to exterminate people through violence and other means as a genocide. 

According to Oxfam, because of an import-export ban imposed on Gaza in 2007, 95% of Gaza’s industrial operations were suspended. Out of 35,000 people employed by 3,900 factories in June 2005, only 1,750 people remained employed by 195 factories in June 2007. By 2010, Gaza's unemployment rate had risen to 40% with 80% of the population living on less than 2 dollars a day.[193] The Israeli Government's continued land, sea and air blockage is tantamount to collective punishment of the population, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs

In January 2008, the Israeli government calculated how many calories per person were needed to prevent a humanitarian crisis in the Gaza strip, and then subtracted eight percent to adjust for the ""culture and experience"" of the Gazans.

1. There are now 7 million Palestinian refugees (4.3 million registered with the UNHCR); 85% of Christian Palestinians have fled.

2. 1.5 million Palestinian Israelis live under race-based Apartheid laws (Nazi- and Apartheid-style compulsory race-based ID at all times; race-based marriage prohibition laws; race-based discrimination over property acquisition, property rights, social participation, travel in their own country and family reunion).

3. 4 million Occupied Palestinians are held as prisoners in increasingly abusive conditions in what outstanding Jewish American scholar Professor Noam Chomsky of the 63-Nobel-Laureate MIT describes as a ""Prison"" (they are held without charge or trial in effectively several major Concentration Camps - Gaza, Samaria and Judaea; their capital city has been stolen and violated together with the Third most Sacred site in Islam).

4. Post-invasion excess deaths (violent and non-violent avoidable deaths from bombs or bullets or deprivation, respectively; deaths that did not have to happen) now total 0.3 million and post-invasion under-5 infant deaths total 0.2 million.

5. Annual Occupied Palestinian avoidable under-5 infant deaths total 2,400; annual violent deaths total about 800 (20% children); annual excess deaths total 5,000 - deaths in custody at the hands of a racist, Apartheid regime.

Also you are being facetious, pulling a figure of 0.042%, care tell us how you worked that figure out?
Hamas + Islamic Jihads does not = Palestine. If a country exists via the forced encroachment on foreign soil it is going to encounter violence. Israel has repeatedly violated UN sanctions and conducted illegal settlements and forced relocations. Israel has every right to defend itself but when it effectively attacks another nation Palestine has no right to defend its people? Also a group cannot conduct genocide upon itself, that was an incredibly stupid thing to even suggest.

If you truly support Israel and cannot see beyond your own bias then  I have to ask, would you do it? Would you press that button or pull that trigger, would you kill those children on beach? Could you justify it to yourself, would you be proud? Would you have defended your people? If the answer is yes, then you are a monster, if the answer is no then you do not in fact support Israel.

Israel isn't going anywhere, the ordinary citizens have as much right to peace as the Palestinians. Israel does have the right to protect its citizens but it does not have the right to murder indiscriminately. The people of Palestine are in an increasingly desperate situation and thus resort to increasingly desperate measures to continue their existence.",0,1406545035,null,0,false,0,cj9wpct,t3_2bvs15,t1_cj9wpct,t1_cj9walv,null,1434937471,8,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,8

In fact, if Ireland had been allowed to keep the food that its people produced, there would have been enough for everyone.  See here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_(Ireland)  Also, as maize wasn't eaten in Ireland previously, most Irish mills were not equipped to mill maize and people didn't know how that it needed to be cooked twice.  This was eventually rectified in some cases.  
  
Peel, to be fair, seems to have meant well.  For instance, he tried repeatedly to repeal the Corn Laws, which kept bread prices artificially high (so it wasn't enough that Irish food was being exported, but what wasn't was ridiculously expensive).  By the time he actually succeeded, what with Parliament initially voting against him, the Famine was much worse.  
  
Suffice it to say, don't go patting yourself on the back just yet.  
  
That said, I am only posting the above to make historical facts clear, not to hold you personally accountable.  In my opinion, remembering events like the Great Famine is not about berating people today who certainly can't go back in time to undo the evil.  Of course, it deserves to be remembered for its own sake, but it's also about making ourselves aware of tragedies around the world today.  By looking back at the awful things that happened in Ireland, we should become more determined to alleviate and stop humanitarian disasters around the world.  The world has enough food and water for us all, just as Ireland had enough food for everyone right through the Famine, and it's a crying shame that we don't better heed the lessons of the Famine and distribute the world's resources more fairly.  I do think that, because of the Famine, [Irish people generally try to give more towards this purpose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Giving_Index#World_Giving_Index_rankings ) (but still not enough, since so many people still suffer).

Does date from before the days ""random"" was such a fucking annoying word to hear though.  A bit sporky.  [Good soundtrack though.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AckvdGbk4w)

On the opposite side of the spectrum, [**Fifteen Stories High**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzr2FhQUONg) is massively underrated deadpan comedy.  A miserable bastard and his awkward flatmate deal with the tedium of living in a tenement block.  Much more inventive and entertaining than it sounds, and it seems to have passed most british people by.

[**Peter Kay's Phoenix Nights**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xkRSuAPDdw) was another work of deadpan genius.  Brian Potter is the cranky, wheelchair bound manager of a shitty working mens' club in North England.  Some Americans seem to think everyone in Britain is Hugh Grant and the whole country is Notting Hill; this is the best introduction to what most of Britain is *actually* like.

However, the person recording this reacts in exactly the wrong way - rather than slowing down and leaving more of a gap so as to mitigate Kia's bad decision, he maintains the gap, which puts him in a more dangerous situation. 

In other videos he actively accelerates towards cars who are quite visibly about to pull out. Despite the fact they shouldn't be, his reaction is unsafe and exacerbates already potentially dangerous situations. In the case of the lorry, his actions could have got him killed. 

The other option is that he hasn't seen the danger coming and if so I'd question his abilities as a driver, as the examples given in this thread so far have all been very clear - so clear that I'd suggest you could use them for hazard perception tests.

Websdesign, advertising, PR, insurance comapnies that are massive will have their hq in London, but massive companies make up a tiny amount of employment (something like 5% of total employed) in professional sectors. The rest is made up of small/medium sized businesses (both professional and lower skilled). 

The reason London is a global city is because of investment over centurys and quite lop sided investment as well, there is no luck about it we could have done it with any city.

The reason our global influence is so high is because were a first world country that used to have the biggest empire on earth until recently leaving a bunch of diplomatic ties to a load of countries across the world due to it and with the English language the language of business around the world making our media/products easier to export. Also there's having a high gdp per capita with 63 million people means were the 6th biggest economy in the world, (and no, contrary to popular belief as I explained before, it isn't the big companies hq'd in London that give us our high gdp, it's all the small/medium ones that are everywhere.) oh and the secruitity council seat along with being one of the big three powers in the EU (the biggest economic bloc in the world) and so able to influence it's dealings (yes we can and do, case and point budget cuts to the EU and pushing for further sanctions on Russia)... the nuclear weapons probably help a fair bit as well which are all maintained and built (along with the fleet that carries them) outside of London.

We need to address our energy concerns right NOW. All your green talk is lovely, but we need to keep the lights on, keep everything running and keep our homes warm (with gas and electric).

But obviously nobody thinks shale gas is a long-term solution. It's a stop-gap, which can supply out immediate needs. During that time, hopefully whatever government is in power will be putting some serious money and resources towards alternative sources. I blame the last several governments for this problem. It has hardly been a secret that fossil fuels are running out, or that they cause environmental damage. But everyone has been happy to keep going with the current system because the prices are cheap and we are short-sighted.

You talk about resource wars, food shortages etc. But let's say that the UK went ultra-green tomorrow. As our oil runs out prices (for everything) would rise enormously. That would hurt the UK economy and everybody living here. We would also have to import more shit from other countries (INCREASING the chance of fighting wars over it). Also, without adequate electricity the economy would crash horribly and the population would be fucking miserable. And really the UK is only a tiny contributor to worldwide climate change anyway. It simply wouldn't be worth the cost for us to do that.

Using shale gas under our own country does not really contribute to runaway climate change, since it's only a small amount on a global scale.

true,djimonia,lfc99,,"Two of my Serbian friends who support us (one's also a Partizan fan) believe with all their hearts that Lazar is absolute overpriced shite. They see him as talented (physically) which helped him stand out in a mediocre Serbian league and then do nothing of note in a full season in Portugal and so feel that the £20M we've paid for him is not much better than what we did with Downing. 

I disagree based on what I've seen because Lazar is going to have a hell of a time bedding in to the team this year. His attitude is not 100% right yet (which I have faith in BR to improve as he's done with a few players) and BR's system, the language, English culture and fan expectation are all going to weigh heavily on him and he could end up suffering from it for a while. Any setbacks to his confidence and his development may get halted. For that reason, I don't see him as anything more than an impact sub this year - though he might get more starts initially due to Lallana's injury. If he works the way Raheem did though, I don't see why he can't develop his game quickly and his understanding with others and overcome any barriers to his development.

I agree though that Lazar's got a hint of Downing about him, based on the game yesterday and most of the videos I've seen of him. He's hugely predictable and often tries to use his pace to paper over things like indecision, timidity, lack of creativeness, and lack of positioning sense. That gets you only so far unfortunately. On the other end of the spectrum of such players who are limited but highly effective is, I think, Antonio Valencia, who uses his strengths superbly and to devastating effect (at least in his prime under Fergie). If Lazar could be become as clinical as that he wouldn't need to be overly clever as he would just be incisive - getting to the by-line, playing crosses and square balls into dangerous areas, beating at least one man every time to draw other defenders out - that's the sort of player I'd love for him to develop into.

You may not need the extra speed, but because people are using more bandwidth the existing 3G networks will likely get slower as time goes on. If we didn't have 4G which has a larger data capacity then 3G would grind to a halt.

I wrote a more extensive explanation before, but I'll give a quick example. (These numbers are made up)

A 3G mast has capacity for 100 people to use the network in 2014, they get decent speeds.

In 2016, due to increasing video quality, image quality, larger websites, more usage of social networks and growing demand more people will use the existing 3G mast and more bandwidth will be used. This mast did support 100 people but because there is extra demand but no extra supply due to the limitations of 3G the network will be much slower, even if you don't use much data.

4G has a larger capacity which solves this (for now), but in the future (maybe as early as 2020) we will have the same issue if internet bandwidth usage continues to increase as it has for many years. 5G will solve this as it has a larger capacity...

What difference? We would have to drill *a lot* of gas to have much of an impact upon European gas prices. If we do, then we'll see lower prices, if not, then we won't.

&gt; **contrary to popular belief as I explained before, it isn't the big companies hq'd in London that give us our high gdp, it's all the small/medium ones that are everywhere**

* No. Actually small and medium enterprises (SMEs) employed 14,424,000 people in the UK in 2013. They contributed less than half of UK GDP. [Evidence - House of Commons Library](http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/sn06078.pdf)

&gt; **The reason our global influence is so high is because were a first world country that used to have the biggest empire**

* Whilst I agree the British empire was central to the development of London as a global trading center and not just a capital city, I don't think it bares any relevance to London's sucess over the last 50 years. 

* If you look at the destination of British exports, both in services and manufactured goods very few end up in Commonwealth nations. In a sense, when we joined the EU we made a choice to leave the commonwealth behind in order to pursue closer trade ties with European nations, and it led to at a modest boom in exports. [Evidence - British Exports, OEC](http://atlas.media.mit.edu/profile/country/gbr/)

&gt; **the security council seat...nuclear weapons**

* Being a nuclear power is one of the reasons for the UKs membership of the security council no doubt. And the Vanguard Class submarines that carry the US built deterrant (with British warheads) was indeed built at Barrow-in-Furness at Cumbria. Having said that, it was built with tax money largely generated in London. Using diplomatic ties to the US, anchored in London. It is administered from the PINDAR/COBRA bunker in... London. The point that was being made was that it is **thanks** to the success, prosperity and influence of London that we are able to have these things, and have them built in the UK - not in spite of it. 


**tl;dr**... I don't get this reddits fetish for hating on London.

He didn't play well. He looked flat footed for a lot of the game and lost possession a few times/paniced and just hit the ball were he was facing. He was closed down very quickly and didn't really know what to do when someone was in his face.

Although, I really liked the confidence he had when he took the ball off of Henderson (?) and sprinted at the defence. **But**, I think he made a bad decision by passing straight to Sterling's feet, because Sterling couldn't do anything besides stop play and look for a pass, whereas we could have had a goal from a through ball. Another good run was when he got us a free kick, but once again he was running to no where and away from goal. Although, he didn't have the best of support or options to pass so I can't blame him. Lastly, I was impressed when he muscled someone off the ball and gave the ball the Can to lead another Counter Attack. Obviously the highlight was when he took the ball and dribbled between two players and opened the goal up for himself. I think he should have at least made the goal keeper work, but I don't give a fuck since he hit that steward on the head!

Out of curiosity, how common is it to have a degree in ""hotel industry"" (hospitality)?  It sounds unusual here so make sure to emphasise and explain what it entails in your job applications. 

 The best way to find advertised jobs is either online or at a job center, but in your case you can contact a range of hotels which are within a reasonable distance of somewhere you can afford to live. There is a high turnover of hotel staff atm so sending CVs where no job is advertised might work. Post CVs with a short cover letter about why you are interested in that particular position/company/area/type of hotel/clientèle. Do a little research and illustrate yiur English language ability, it makes a huge difference. 

 Cost of living is going to be difficult to calculate before you arrive. Bear in mind that accommodation and food prices vary hugely between inner and outer city and between North and South. Birmingham is pretty reasonable but you would struggle to find a place for less than £60-70 rent a week per bedroom. Read the contract carefully and ask an English friend to explain anything opaque. Don't sign it until you're sure.

Remember to check council tax rates and include this cost when you calculate your accommodation costs as this is paid separately.

Don't get a job somewhere so far from where you live that the commute eats half your salary. Check the cost before choosing a house or job. Public transport can be expensive and  circuitous.  If you are under 25 and can drive, car insurance can be expensive at first.

 Although you won't pay income tax on your first £10000 per annum you will pay national insurance of 10%. For anything you earn above £10000 you will pay national insurance and 20% income tax.

Make sure you know your rights re minimum wage and do not allow yourself to be taken advantage of and paid an illegally low rate. Know your EU free movement and employment dues under the EU. Employers may try and push their luck when you first arrive. Don't give them an easy target.

If you smoke bring cigarettes with you or you will have a heart attack here. It is £8 for 20 cigarettes here.

Don't worry about health care, we have that covered. Find out your nearest GP surgery and register when you arrive. Don't wait until you're ill. All you do then is call and make an appointment if you're ill.

999 is the number for emergency services.

Most importantly learn frequently used British idioms or you'll struggle with guests and locals. Similarly, before you come to Birmingham listen to a brummie (a person from Birmingham) speak on youtube and try and get used to it.

The idea should be that this is a stop gap. Renewables are not suitable as a direct replacement yet for all fossil power currently produced, and nuclear is an expensive option, not to mention the length of time it takes to get running. By the time shale runs out, we would be in a position to replace entirely with green alternatives. 


 &gt;How're you going to regulate it to maximise safety?

Can't answer that, but I imagine it would be down to the mining version of OFGEM. 

&gt;What constitutes ""exceptional circumstances"" for fracking in a national park, or area of outstanding beauty?

I imagine the idea behind this is not not tie our own hands in the future. They aren't going to specify what that means until such an occasion arises, but at least there is room for discussion/debate. 

&gt;What are the projections for energy prices? Will they be forced down by regulation, or will energy companies be allowed to simply pocket the difference?

Good question, one I don't know the answer to. However the Torys have indicated little desire to enforce price changes on the energy market. 

&gt;In the event of negative outcomes, (e.g. earthquakes, polluted water table, etc.) what are the processes to bring this to a halt to prevent further damage?

Again, down to the regulator but I imagine there are already such measures in place for our on shore oil drilling. An explanation of those measures wouldn't go unwarranted though. 

&gt;What do the people of Britain actually think of fracking? Are they generally pro fracking? 

I'm interested to know in particular the oppositions view on fracking, is Ed or Nick a fan or not? Or are going to sit on the fence?

This puts in the hands of a few (the producers and organisers) the power to feed the many who no longer need to feed themselves. This almost always means armies which go gather slaves to feed mining or other production, for example all the ingredients for industrial revolution were in place in the Roman Empire except the need because they had such a plentiful supply of slaves. There's even an argument that historically ""hill people"" rather than just being uncivilization barbarians are often those who fled *from* civilization because of this inherent in built control of it. 

In short civilisation has always been (and in many ways still is) a system that leads to the few being able to exploit the many. It can be done well, in which case it can be the best thing for the most people, or it can be done badly... we've mostly done it badly.

&gt;There are now 7 million Palestinian refugees

There are now less than 50,000 Palestinian refugees according to the actual definition of refugee that the UN High Commission on Refugees applied to the other 100 million people who have become refugees in the last 70 years, namely one generation only, and the status does not pass from parents to endless generations in a deliberate attempt to manufacture more refugees.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;1.5 million Palestinian Israelis 

1.5 million Palestinian Israelis live with equal civil and democratic rights to all Israelis including speech, religion, etc, far more than the rights available in any Arab country, and female Israeli Arabs have rights light years better than any  Arab country.  Israeli Arabs are completely integrated in Israeli society, universities, health care, transportation, entertainment, restaurants, etc. they serve as Ambassadors, Cabinet Ministers and Supreme Court justices. Israel has a government funded system of Sharia Law and hijabs are legal unlike many Islamaphobic European countries.

&gt;Palestinians are held as prisoners

Palestinians in the West Bank are free to come and go through Jordan all they want and 10s of thousands enter and leave Jordan every day. So claiming this is a prison because we don't let them into our country at will is insane.

&gt;avoidable under-5 infant deaths 

Actually Palestinians have as low or lower rates of under 5 mortality than many surrounding Arab countries


source UNICEF http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/

2012 Under-5 mortality rate for Palestine is  23 per 1000 births.

2012 Under-5 mortality rate for Egypt is  21 per 1000 births.

Journal of Social Science &amp; Medicine. Volume 58, Issue 3, February 2004, Pages 463–470 ""The extraordinary decline of infant and childhood mortality among Palestinian refugees""




The main cause of Palestinian infant mortality and in general in the Arab world, as dozens of published studies show is actually the common Palestinian and Arab practice of first cousin incest marriages, where multiple generation of incest lead to very high birth defect rates.

&gt;their capital city has been stolen and violated together with the Third most Sacred site in Islam

In fact the exact opposite is true. The Arab country of Jordan illegally occupied Jerusalem from 1949 to 1967. During these 18 years no Jew on the entire planet, not Israeli and not from any other country was allowed to pray in Jerusalem, not one. All Jews world wide were completely banned from Jerusalem for 18 years. Every synagogue in Jerusalem was destroyed and every Jewish graveyard, some thousands of years old were bulldozed by the Jordanians.

So exactly the opposite of what you claimed is what really happened. Jews were banned from praying in Jerusalem by Arabs.
Under Israel which protects the freedom of all the religions in Jerusalem, Islam has flourished:

In 1996 a major renovation costing millions with full Israeli approval and cooperation resulted in the opening of one of the worlds largest Mosques on Al Aqsa, the Marwani Mosque http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon's_Stables

Renovations and repairs to the Al Aqsa under Israel: http://www.akdn.org/architecture/project.asp?id=501

In 1998, the golden dome covering was refurbished under Israeli cooperation following a donation of $8.2 million by King Hussein of Jordan, who sold one of his houses in London to fund the 80 kilograms of gold required. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF3bo9cR9Xo

Last year during Ramada 2013, up to 400,000 Palestinians entered Israel each day to pray on Al Aqsa.

true,whal3c,null,null,"As much as I dislike Allardyce, I think that this is a sad example of the board's piss poor management of the club. The way that communication is handled in particular is bordering on farcical - either back the manager, or sack him - don't try and go on some ridiculous middle way because it makes everyone look stupid. It's becoming clear to me that the Davids don't want to sack BFS because they can't afford to - him being in the top 20 best paid managers in the world, a ridiculous situation in itself.

The examples of their complete incompetence aren't limited to this summer, here are a few that spring to mind for me:

* Releasing details to the press of the fallout over Ravel Morrison's future - board vs Sam argument.
* Admitting that we need to sign another striker now because of Andy Carroll's injury and calling his signing ""a mistake"". If you had realised this last season we might not be in the mess we are now, and we wouldn't have had to go through the stupid business of releasing/re-signing Carlton Cole.
* Making strong hints that there are ""board signings"" and ""Allardyce signings"" - Zarate=board signing/Carroll=Allardyce signing. Then using this as a way to pass the buck when things go wrong.
* General sense that all successes are because of the board, but they cannot be blamed for failures because there are always extenuating circumstances.
* The circus at the beginning of the summer with the will they/won't they sack BFS. What did this achieve?
* Hiring Avram Grant when he had just taken Portsmough to last place and relegation, for him to then take us to last place and relegation.
* The atrocious way that they treated Grant when he was manager, and still failing to make a definite decision on his future. Statements in media saying that we had hired Martin O'Neill and then it didn't happen/sacking Grant in the tunnel after the final game of the season, and only letting him return to London with the squad after the players insisted he join them on the team coach.

Yes, they have done their bit to save the club from financial meltdown, but the way that they conduct their business is at times unacceptable and not befitting of the club. Rant over.

One thing that bugs me and I think fuels irrational fear/hatred of Islam is that the reporting is skewed on which group is attacking who.

There have been frequent attacks of Mosques, Muslim schools and Muslims in the past few years - only the biggest of which (such as the Islamic school set on fire) make the news.

Meanwhile, if there is an Islamic person who does something to any other individual it gets tons of attention.

Not saying it shouldn't get the attention but I think it is unfair that one gets lots of press attention and the other doesn't. Main reason is because the Muslim doing something will play to people's perceptions. The former won't.

The UN has found the blockade of Gaza to be illegal and a violation of human rights, the blockade is another form of collective punishment.

Do you take Palestinian refugees to be defined as people displaced from what was formerly Palestine in 1948, because that would conveniently provide you with a much lower figure?

http://www.unrwa.org/palestine-refugees

Palestinians are equal in Israel? I wonder are there any differences in the levels of poverty exhibited between jewish and muslim people in Israel? How many Palestinians or muslims are there in the Israeli government? Is there an arabic language university in Israel? How integrated are the communities? How many muslims are there in the Israeli military? Perhaps they are equal *in theory* but I very much doubt they are in practice.

http://www.seamac.org/EqualRights.htm

Palestinians have complete freedom of movement through the West Bank? You mention Jordan the fact that you do so highlights a major point that Palestinians are more able to move freely through a foreign country than they are in their own land.
&gt; Israel enforces restrictions on the freedom of movement of Palestinians in the West Bank by employing a system of permanent, temporary and random manned checkpoints, the West Bank Barrier and by forbidding the usage of roads by Palestinians.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_freedom_of_movement

In terms of infant mortality you say Palestinians and link to the unicef website, I don't know why you would do that as there is no state of Palestine to gather data from, if you are trying to make it appear that conditions for Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank are good then you are lying.

It would seem pretty obvious that having agreement between the board and the manager is central to success. These stupid fights played out the media help nothing, and neither does the board meddling in the manager's business. The manager should be responsible for the playing staff, if the board don't like the way he does this they should find a new manager.

Everything going on at the moment will be disturbing pre-season preparations and destabilising the playing squad. Both the board AND Sam have a level of responsibility for this, but ultimately only the board are in a position to change this. Sam is not going to walk away from the massive cash bonanza that he is getting at West Ham, so if the board want him to go they need to acknowledge their own fuck-ups and sack him - which they should have done months ago if they wanted to ensure a decent pre-season.

Do you really think that the transfer committee isn't looking everywhere for bargains like Coutinho? They can't just load up FM Genie and sort by potential; most clubs know how good their players are and want the corresponding value from a transfer. Besides, Coutinho was never a sure thing, but we had to take big risks to propel ourselves up into the CL spots and thankfully they worked out. This season we need sure things (or as close as you can get in football).

Markovic is effectively our Coutinho signing this season, anyway. Huge potential and considerably cheaper than he could have been thanks to a third party who wanted to sell. Yes, he cost more than Coutinho, but he's more likely to make it than most people would have considered Coutinho to be when he first arrived.

It's completely reasonable for a defender to be 12m more expensive after a year. Average players stay around the same price. Good players skyrocket after a year of high exposure. Look at the other Rodriguez (Ha-mes, not Ha-y); his value has doubled by the tune of 40m Euros after a year of exposure at Monaco and in the World Cup.

And because the war had made a lot of soldiers and factory workers quite wealthy (soldiers in the US military were paid vastly more than their allied counterparts at any rank, and there was lots of overtime for factory workers) Americans could go out and start spending on whatever they wanted.

Whereas over in Europe rationing was still happening, the countries were all broke, bombed and demoralised, and massive amounts of money, effort and goods had to be poured into rebuilding homes and factories before people could even think of turning out cars or refrigerators, let alone electric powered ice crushers or egg whisk/potato peeler combination gadgets. 

And America spent a lot of time in the 1950s-90s dealing with it's social problems. Yes, there were riots and movements and repression, but by and large American society changed for the better in most respects.

The highlights I saw from the pre-season matches we played weren't pretty, but two things to bear in mind:

1) Pre-season matches are about fitness, not points.

2) As much as I bitched about how Sam set up the squad in matches without Andy last season, the lads **did** seem to be trying something other than route 1 during these pre-season matches.

""Whilst I agree the British empire was central to the development of London as a global trading center and not just a capital city, I don't think it bares any relevance to London's sucess over the last 50 years.
If you look at the destination of British exports, both in services and manufactured goods very few end up in Commonwealth nations. In a sense, when we joined the EU we made a choice to leave the commonwealth behind in order to pursue closer trade ties with European nations, and it led to at a modest boom in exports. Evidence - British Exports, OEC""

**It was central to the development of the entire UK, I don't know how to make it easier for you but 14 million does not beat 49 million when it comes to any industry in the UK other than financial services which employ a tiny amount of the population.**

**I know very well most of exports head to the EU, half of trade is with them which is why the idea of leaving is so silly. Londons success has come through investment by government and being located closer to the EU in the past 50 years as well as Thatcher switching the UK economy more to the service sector.**

**The British empire point was followed by spreading English around the world, it's a competitive advantage when dealing with all countrys in matters of business in the EU as well as the rest of the world.**

""Being a nuclear power is one of the reasons for the UKs membership of the security council no doubt. And the Vanguard Class submarines that carry the US built deterrant (with British warheads) was indeed built at Barrow-in-Furness at Cumbria. Having said that, it was built with tax money largely generated in London. Using diplomatic ties to the US, anchored in London. It is administered from the PINDAR/COBRA bunker in... London. The point that was being made was that it is thanks to the success, prosperity and influence of London that we are able to have these things, and have them built in the UK - not in spite of it""

**Most tax is taken from the 55 million people outside of London.. I have no idea where you get the idea from that 8 million people pay anywhere the amount of the other 55 million in tax revenue. [See here for proof](http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/4001/economics/tax-revenue-sources-in-uk/)**

**It's administered in London.. that doesn't make it anything special.. it could be administrated anywhere in the UK. It couldn't be built in London, it can in Barrow in furnace. We are able to have these things because an American diplomat pissed off one of ours so much that we decided to go ahead and build our own nuclear bombs, then we agreed to buy American trident systems after already having our own nuclear weapons because it cost less (guess what our nuclear weapons were built outside of London as well, shocking isn't it?) and the other reason we decided to get nuclear weapons was of course the USSR, it has nothing to do with London.**

**Of course we would be poorer without it, if you suddenly take away 8 million people it's going to have an effect, if Scotland goes independent, were going to be poorer for it as well, financially as a country and through influence through a decreased population and so a smaller market/economy, this isn't something unique to London.**

**It's not about hating on London, it's when people say something that is wrong and needs correcting. If it happens so often then perhaps people should stop saying incorrect things about London.**

true,hotcod,null,null,"&gt; The fact that the EIC decided to take over the country was not a British Government decision and should not be laid at our feet.

[What you mean using powers they were granted directly by the monarchy in 1670?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company) After which the EIC continued expansion and considaltion in India even after the [Regulating Act of 1773](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulating_Act_of_1773) that establsihed more firm goverment control over the company, including making all lands under it's control offcialy part of the Crown. This was followed in 1784 by the [Pitts india Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitt%27s_India_Act) which made rule in Indian a joint partership with the Goverment with the Goverment having ulitment athority. 

This means that Company Rule in India, which was only possible to power granted by the Government, lasted from (taking the earliest date) 1753 to 1858 or 105 years. For 74 of those years the EIC was officially the junior in a Governmental partnership and the lands it controlled officially if not practically under Government control for 85. 

The EIC was the result of British mercantilism and it's expansion into India while maybe not totally intended was the result of the Government granting them the powers to do exactly that and control of the company was ultimately in the hands of the State long before the end of Company Rule in India... intended or not what the EIC did can be laid at the feet of the government that granted them the power to do it, a government did not revoke that power but instead brought the company under state control.

I am excited about him signing and I think he is a step in the right direction when it comes to a more stable defensive performance from the team (although it's as much formation and system as it is the players, but that's a different discussion).

The problem is not losing Daniel Agger the player, it's losing Agger the adopted Scouser and Agger the absolute legend. This guy to Barcelona to suck a dick on two occasions when they tried signing him, he has YNWA tattooed across his knuckles. He is a humble guy of the pitch and as passionate as they come on it. I have lost count how many times Agger has gone full HAM on an opposing player, not because they said something to him, but because they tried picking on one of our players. In my mind, Agger is fully deserving of the vice-captaincy, and being remembered as one of our all time greats.

Last season Agger was not just unlucky with injuries, but the timing of those injuries. But as most stats show, he performs pretty much as good as all of our other CB's. Can we defend having four ""first-team"" CB's? Probably not. Is Agger the most likely to leave? Probably. I really wish he would get another chance to prove what he can do, and have a season without injuries.

Leaving sentiment out of this, Agger is the most reasonable choice if we want to get rid of one of our four CB's, but I for one can not watch football without sentiment.

This summer will probably see two of the greatest players we've had since I started watching Liverpool in the early 90's leave - Reina and Agger, and I feel like neither is getting the send off they deserve.

It doesn't work like that.  

Hypothetical situation: Against all the odds we have another brilliant season. Matt Targett, Harrison Reed and Sam Gallagher show off our amazing academy talent and Pelle and Tadic form an amazing partnership. We finish 7th. Guess what? It's going to happen again. The big clubs will come calling and our players will want to move on. We can be as ambitious as we want, but when our talented players are in the shop window every week, they're going to attract attention and we're going to find it hard to hold onto them, because we're Southampton not Chelsea. Until the culture of money in football changes dramatically, that's how it's going to work, unfortunately.

Lucas was crap last season and this pre-season, the injuries have definitely taken a toll on him. Allen is a decent enough back-up, and Hendo and Gerrard are great. So we pretty much have three wildcards that can't guarantee consistently good performances, and two players that are great. If we're gonna compete on different fronts this year, CL and PL, we WILL need quality back-up. Sure you could say that Coutinho and Lallana can be brought down a notch on the pitch, but I'd rather see them further up the pitch, in their natural posistions. IMO getting a good consistent midfielder is a MUST.

The large number of drill sites also mean that even when the industry quotes very low risks of particular types of incidents at any given site, when you are aware just how many drilling sites are likely to be running, the probability of those types of accidents occurring _somewhere_ in he country is very much greater.  Added to which, the probability of well casings leaking _eventually_ is not low, it's actually fairly high, and it's unlikely that the companies which are seeking licenses, which are small caps, will be around for the longer term high cost clean-ups, monitoring and repair which will be necessitated.

Players are either playing at clubs below your club's level or above your club's level. If they're playing at a club below your club's level, they're attainable. If they're playing at a club above your clubs level, they'll want ridiculous wages and you'll get bent over (e.g. United getting bent over by a bigger club in the Shaw deal)

Southampton have several good players. The rest of their squad isn't as good, so they finished 8th. United, Bayern, etc have been winning titles for years by hoovering up all the talent at the lower clubs and that's exactly what we are doing now.

Lallana is a very good player. Lovren is a very good player. Lambert was a very good value signing. It's a coincidence that they all happened to play for Southampton.

Lazy journalism is responsible for the Rodriguez talk. Just because you read ""Liverpool want to sign Cavani,"" doesn't mean Rodgers has ever had the thought cross his mind for a millisecond.

""Bigger names"" tend to demand ridiculous wages that would destroy our wage structure and are generally massively overhyped by the FM generation.

What the hell is a ""bigger name"" anyway? Does it mean players playing for the top few clubs in the world that don't need to sell?

true,IndigoStrike,num15,,"&gt; no-one thought Bale was going to turn into what he is today

No, but we thought he would turn into a talented left-back, which was looking very awry indeed before he was played on the wing. Green would be more expensive as the prices players go for now have increased since we bought Bale, he's an attacking player whereas Bale was defensive, and attackers tend to go for more. He wouldn't be homegrown, but for what he would give us in seasons to come, 5 million (the price being banded about) would be a good investment.

&gt; Also what kind of message does it send to players when are spending that kind of money on youth who likely wont help the team this season instead of buying proven help in areas where we desperately need it??

Obviously if the choice is between a 5 million centre back with Green as opposed to a 15 million centre back then yes, the immediate concerns of the team come first. And I believe it sends the message that we are a youthful, ambitious team. Which we are, even looking at our current squad.

 I don't think we'd get him for 5 million, as I doubt if he's got the potential to be really good, Bayern wouldn't let him go.

Edit: Forgot we agreed to disagree :) I can understand where other people are coming from, and I wouldn't want Green over any first team improvements, especially since we have other young guys starting to break in who have been with us for a long time. I can see another team picking up Green though, and doing well with him - and as long as they aren't too big, Spurs could sign him next season or so with not much price increase. I haven't seen much of Green bar the WC but if Bayern have stuck with him until this age, he must have some quality.

I guess I see Green's potential wildly different to everyone else... Explains why I'm not a scout then! 

&gt; For someone who's played in the German fourth tier? If you're suggesting paying £10m for anyone who's a regular fourth tier player anywhere in the world, you have some explaining to do.

Judging from his perfomance data on transfermarkt, he's not a regular player in the fourth tier - he's a star. 18 goals in 28 games from the left-wing last season? And he's probably being treated like our youngsters when they get sent to Swindon - they're too good technically to play there, but go for the experience and to learn physically the game.

Edit for your edit:

&gt; what about Falque? Loaned out to a LL side. Ceballos, Obika, Coulthirst and a few others I'm forgetting who have been loaned out to second and third division sides (Ceb was in the Portuguese first division). I don't see anyone thinking about spending £10m on them.

Falqué is 24 and doesn't have much room for natural development yet. Ceballos is a relative unknown (hell, even I don't know what he got up to last season). Obika is 23 and didn't improve after 19. Coulthirst isn't that good either.

The reason I said under 10 mil is because Green is on the international stage now - an American in Germany being courted by an English club. None of the players you've mentioned have gotten within a sniff of the full national team. Admittedly, it is harder for Spanish and English players to get into their national teams, but I don't think they would have made it into the American team either. I believe Jurgen has a keen eye for players and knows that Green can do a job, otherwise he wouldn't have brought him to the WC. As far as I know, the Americans were under a lot of pressure to really succeed in the cup, so bringing youth players along for the ride would not have sat well. Americans can correct me if I'm wrong on that though.

true,PopeGregoryIX,eng-Cornwall,Kernow,"Former 118118 employee here:

In 2007 they shut down all of their UK call centres and moved all of their operations to the Philippines (or rather, a large chunk was already there, and they moved the rest of it over). Prior to that they had been increasing their prices on an almost monthly basis and probably still do. 

Their whole operation was designed to eke out as much revenue as possible. 

The biggest cost of calling 118 is the initial connection, as, although the per minute charge was very high, you would rarely be on the phone to them for that long (my own average call time was usually around 25-30 seconds, with barely a breath in between). That is, unless you are lazy enough to have them put you through, in which case you are charged at their rate for the entire call. Contrary to the apparent belief of a lot of callers who didn't like to be asked questions, we were not being paid to keep them on the phone longer. Completely the opposite in fact. On a ""good"" day, I would take about 800 calls. 

In any case, I would be able to find a number on the 118118 system a fuck sight faster than they would by googling it on their phone. 

There was never really any particular type of person who would phone so I think it was more circumstantial than that i.e. people out and about with no access to the internet, or too drunk to use a browser. Busiest days were valentines day (and the day before) and mother's day (plus the day before) when suddenly everyone needed a florist NOW. 

Prank calls were also very common. Kids asking for businesses with ""funny"" names, wanting the number of my mum ,asking questions about penises (after the ""ask us anything"" service was introduced) etc.

Anyway, I'm baffled that it still exists. When I was there it almost seemed like they were deliberately running it into the ground. Call volumes were on a permanent downward trajectory and smartphones were still relatively new.

I think there's also an advantage in terms of cooling the motors (as they are surrounded by seawater), and also this system takes up less space in the ship since the motors and prop shafts are moved outside the hull.

Leamington is split between a north of the river/south of the river richer/poorer gradient.

true,the_ultravixens,null,null,"Not necesarilly.  Fracking (or indeed scraping oil off rocks) has a very low 'EROEI', or energy returned on energy invested.  This is the *key* measure of how good an energy source something is.  It's the ratio of input energy:output energy.   A good value for an energy source is something like 30-40:1.  This means that for every barrel of oil of energy you put in, you get about 40 out, which you can then use for other stuff.  Various estimates have fracked oil/gas at somewhere around 10:1.  The glory days in saudi or Texas were getting you 100:1.

Modern industrial society is estimated to require a minimum EROEI of around 10-15:1 to sustain itself.  So it's *extremely* fucking dicey as to whether fracked oil would be viable to sustain industrial society.  The closer you get to the threshold, the nastier things get.

This argument is also why economists are wrong when they say ""oh higher prices will just mean we move to harder to extract reserves"".  Harder to extract reserves give lower energy profit ratios, until eventually it takes a barrel of oil to get a barrel of oil out of the ground.

You also haven't answered any other point about Lukaku lacking bottle, which he does. Cheers. Despite not wanting wages, he makes childish comments and thinks better of himself than he is, it's good he wants to improve but he thinks he's entitled to that start spot. He needs to earn it, like Azpilicueta did, like Andre is going to. He can't walk into it. That's why he doesn't have bottle. If he is 2nd striker for Chelsea and Torres leaves (both should happen) he'll see an abundance of minutes, more than enough of what he needs and improve as a player, and part of the squad. If he leaves despite this, he doesn't have the bottle for the challenge. I don't know why that's difficult to see. I'd be delighted with him coming on a sub for Costa, and he'd starting games Costa doesn't, with Drogba coming on if we need another goal or to close a game out as he's the best at that. Schurrle didn't always see minutes last season. Did he bitch and moan? No, he got on with it and stuck his head down because he gets the club, and as a result will likely be first team this year. If he did what Lukaku did he'd most likely be off ala De Bruyne. You can't deny that.

I'm talking about minutes here. Costa and Lukaku would end up with similiar minutes if both stayed, Costa would start more but Lukaku would get more subs and play games Costa wouldn't.

true,mmmmmh,null,null,"&gt; Fracking is simpler because there's less that can go wrong, and because if things do go wrong there's less potential for catastrophic events to occur.

That's fair play. Out of interest ('coz I'm lazy and you seem pretty clued up on this topic) we see horror stories about fracking leading to earthquakes (or at least increased earthquakes in areas with fracking) and gas coming out of taps and such. Have those things been found to be wrong, or have we found a way to stop them? Or are we just assuming they're not related to fracking? 

&gt; Fracking is just a completion technique, and once we've been using for basically as long as the UK oil industry has existed. The rest of the process is just standard run of the mill onshore drilling, something we've also been doing for about 40 years.

I thought the issue was that the extra bit we do different to normal (digging across and blasting waste in there) could cause instability in the rocks, which isn't something we've been doing for ages? And on top of that, economically, the cost of us extracting our own gas via fracking amount to more than it would cost us just to ship it over from elsewhere?


Thanks for taking the time to respond and bringing the other side to the debate.

No shit Les. We aren't the kind of club kids dream of playing for, everyone wants to play for the big boys. You don't go selling our most promising young players just because they don't see themselves playing for us their whole career.

If that's all it takes for the club to agree to sell we might as well pack in being an actual football club and just go full time as a youth development and recruitment agency. Incredibly weak from the board.

As for the ""bringing in talent"" part, I'll find it comforting once I actually see some talent come in. 

This whole statement just kind of smacks of ""I swear to god this isn't what it looks like"" meanwhile he's there with his dick in the trifle.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"Earthquakes (or rather, tremors, the only one found so far in the UK was measurable only with seismographs, and couldn't be felt by humans) are caused by the use of CRI wells - where waste fluid and solids are injected back into holes which have been previously drilled. It's common practise in the entire oil industry and unless the tremors actually become in any way serious, then it's a good solution for environmental waste disposal.

&gt;and gas coming out of taps and such.

That's a big part of the Gasland scare story narative. They show you gas coming out of taps and tell you fracking is occurring nearby and expect you to put two and two together, and people do. What they don't tell you is that if you'd held up a lighter to these taps 50 years ago you'd have got the same thing. There are many sources of water in parts of the world which generate *biogenic* methane, that is, the methane is naturally generated by little microbes which live somewhere in the water system (kind of similar to how methane is naturally generated by microbes in land fill sites).

So the former isn't related to fracking but is related to the oil industry but isn't really a big problem, and the latter is not related to fracking or the oil industry.

&gt;I thought the issue was that the extra bit we do different to normal (digging across and blasting waste in there) could cause instability in the rocks, which isn't something we've been doing for ages?

Hydraulic fracturing is done once the well has been drilled and is the process of forcing a combination of mostly sand and water into the hole at high pressures. This has been done in the UK oil industry since the 1970's, and globally is about a century old technique. I'm not hugely sure what you mean by instability in the rock, do you mean you're worried about tremors, or something else?

&gt;And on top of that, economically, the cost of us extracting our own gas via fracking amount to more than it would cost us just to ship it over from elsewhere?

Not really something you need to worry about. Extraction will be done by private companies, and if it's economical they'll make money and if it's not they either won't do it or they'll lose money.

&gt;Thanks for taking the time to respond and bringing the other side to the debate.

No problem at all.

Then you probably have a very, very skewed opinion of it.

true,FlappyBored,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"They weren't conquered easily. If you actually know anything about the history of trade with India or the colonisation you would realise it took centuries. Its not like the British just racked up and took over the place in a day.

The start of real colonisation happened when Mir Jafar a commander in the Bengali Army secretly agreed with the British to betray his ruler in order for him to be placed on the thrown of Bengal but in return he would allow the East India Company and the British extreme trade freedoms within his new empire, essentially turning himself into a puppet for Britain in return for becoming the ruler of Bengal.

You could read more about that battle on Wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Plassey

Without that betrayal the British would not have been able to defeat the Bengali rulers in combat because the Bengali army was superior then what the British had stationed there.

Before then the British had to spend years(almost a century) trying to please and convince local rulers to allow them to set up trading posts and compete with the Dutch(who eventually focused on the spice trade in Indonesia) and the Portuguese.  They would bring gifts and send envoys from Britain in an attempt to woo them over. Queen Elizerbeth wrote letters to emperors and rulers in India praising them in the letters asking for them to allow British envoys to arrive and trade etc.

[Here's one of the letters she sent to Emporer Akbar.](http://www.goplaces.in/blog/quiztory-53-01a-letter-from-the-uttermost-parts-of-the-world/)

Its not exactly the 'we're superior bow down to us' and then everyone did like you seem to think it was, it was a long tough campaign that took centuries to come to fruition and was a slow and steady expansion of the EIC and then using that to take advantage of political instabilities to place in puppet rulers. It was impossible for the British to defeat the native armies on their own in a straight up war. Britain was not really in anyway mega superior to the native empires that were present in India, it just took advantage of the political situations better. As you're probably aware these same political tensions were present in Britain too as shit tons of people over our history have come to the throne in England and Scotland through bloodshed, war or betrayal. We've been ruled by the French, Romans and people from Northern Europe.


A modern day example would be if America had a special company dedicated to setting up trade within Britain and people like Obama etc spent centuries fostering very good relationships with the rulers of Britain and exchanged money and gifts with them in return for land and exclusive trade rights in Britain and then after centuries of increasing relations making a deal with another member of the aristocracy who has armies loyal to him to place them in as the ruler of Britain in return for allowing America vast freedoms to do anything they want in Britain.  


If you're interested in more history about the spice trade and how Britain and other European empires started up in that region that check out Nathaniels Nutmeg by Giles Milton, breaks it down really well and tells the story using journals from envoys and sailors.

As for management, Pochettino is new to us... you'd do well to find good thought pieces on his style ([example](http://www.zonalmarking.net/2014/05/16/pass-completion-and-possession/)).

Pure speculation.

Indeed, the evidence is increasing that in many cases that fracking _was_ responsible for methane leaks into the water supplies.  Certainly, anecdotally, many landowners are certain this is what has happened in their experience, and scientific analyses are also corroborating this.

&gt;This has been done in the UK oil industry since the 1970's, and globally is about a century old technique.

Srna would keep his place.

Corluka has done well the last season in the Russian league from what I've heard, so I'm not sure by how much he's improved since he left Spurs.  I know Besler has had a great season too so far, so I reckon they're about equal, with Corluka maybe edging it. Besler is quicker though, which would be useful alongside a slower back like Lovren, who is good enough to stay.

I may have exaggerated my claim slightly, but there are some attacking players that would get in the Croatia squad from the American too - Dempsey is certainly skillful enough to get in (too bad he didn't show too much of it at Spurs) while Jermain Jones and Michael Bradley are much better than any of Croatia's defensive midfielders.

I don't want to sound like an American fanatic now (I'm not even American), so I'll accept that Croatia's youth policy is much better than the USA's to get a better team. Although men in the USA have so many sports to choose from that athletes don't often make football their first choice.

This is where your argument falls down. You assume that the rules are entirely proportionate and logical and that anyone breaking them MUST be doing something wrong, that is not true.

I would totally agree with you if that were the case, but it's not.

The original reason for creating parking restrictions is to stop people obstructing the roads and for parking in such a way which causes inconvenience for other road users.

Now lets consider the example in my area. They recently started painting parking boxes on the road which just introduces another ""rule"" to be enforced. If your tire is a bit over the line you will receive a parking ticket for breaking the rule, even if by parking in such a manner you do not obstruct or cause any inconvenience for anyone, the simple fact is your tyre is slightly over the line therefore you will get a ticket.

Then consider how they introduced these parking bays in which the only way to pay for a ticket is walk into a local shop and buy one from the front counter. Meanwhile the clever parking warden sits and waits for unsuspecting motorists to pop out of their car before swooping in and giving out a ticket. The motorist has zero defence as the shops are 3 minute walk from the parking space.

But at the same time, we've managed to get loads of people into jobs, even more so than before the crisis hit. But if we're not producing more goods/services, what are all these extra people doing??

What's happened is that we've hired loads more people, but we've done less work, so the productivity of the nation has plummeted. The so-called productivity gap. While we have succesfully recovered our output we are really struggling with the fundamental factors of our economy.

That's a long term problem because as the global economy matures, if our factors of production (and our labour force being a pretty important one) are actually *getting worse* we can't continue to attract investment. Better to set up shop in Germany or the United States where productivity growth is going great.

They're in the Europa league this season, they need depth and forwards that can score goals in Europe. Lukaku can provide that. Who's going to do it otherwise. Kone, maybe. Hope, McAleny, unlikely.

No quotes of Lukaku saying ""Yeah I think I'm going to go to Everton, Chelsea really fucked me in the ass so I'm out."" or ""I pretty much need to be the first choice striker or I'm done at this club. Thanks for nothing, Roman."" **It is all Martinez**. Who did they bring in to strengthen their team this summer? Gareth Barry. They lost two key players that played from them last season in Deulofeu and Lukaku.

Enough with the shitty attitude posts. There have been what, two articles, that quote Lukaku saying he might leave if he doesn't get more time? Or that he just wants more time?

Is he wrong to worry? The club has a veritable army of young talent out on loan every season, and we either bring in a new striker striker (Eto'o, Costa, or Drogba) or a manager tries to hammer square-peg-Torres into the slot again in the hopes that he scores some goals. 

The club currently has three strikers on the books for next season: one is a club legend, one is a new expensive signing, and the other is an expensive piece of shit which **FIVE** managers have tried to get working and who seems to get starts in the first team regardless of how well he's playing.

I find it difficult to question his work ethic. He was banging goals into the back of nets with Anderlecht when he was 17. He's got at least four top flight seasons scoring 15+ league goals, two of which have been in England.

Does he deserve to be the go-to #9 in the squad. No.

Does he deserve to be second in the pecking order under Diego Costa. Probably, if not yes.

Keep in mind that most people here were pretty hyped about Lukaku when he signed 3 years ago. 

When Torres was playing poorly ""ugh we need to recall Lukaku"". 

When we needed offensive cover ""ugh y do roman not play lukaku, fuken idort sending him on loan"". 

When people bring up the pitfalls of Chelsea's youth system ""look at Lukaku he might leave because our youth policy sux."" 

When the squad was going through a scoring funk ""look at Lukaku, scoring goals at west brom wtf y is he not here.""

When Mourinho came back. ""Oh Lukaku is going to play so well because he's a mou player who fits the system™.""

And now that he wants time he's a spoiled child who never really proved himself at a high level with all of these problems in his style of play.

I'm not talking about shopping. There was a street that allowed parking outside where I worked. They double yellowed it (seemingly a common addition in town). My company installed a second story to the onsite car park to take up the extra capacity. Then the council started talking about charging tax on the value of the ""perk"" of actually being able to park outside the place you work.

I personally told my manager that if we were made to pay for the privilege of working for them I'd go find employment elsewhere.

true,lommym,num11,,"Haha, yeah the search system sucks.  

I'll give my quick rundown...

Keepers - **Lloris** is fantastic. **Vorm** was someone I would have wanted as a starter 2 years ago, befoer Lloris, but dipped in form.  Good backup. **Friedel** is someone I'm glad to have as part of the team. 

RB - **Walker** Went from shaky to consistent, imo.  Explosive athlete.  **Naughton** is a backup... gets a bad rap, but is really a fine backup. 

CB - **Dawson** really likes the club, but is (bluntly) not good enough.  **Vertonghen** Did not have an A-level season, but is still quality and someone we should keep unless like 30 mil+ drop for him.  **Kaboul** Big, fast, strong.  According to Walker, he was the fastest  over 100m.  Injury prone. Lots of ?'s on him.  **Chiricheș** is fairly young, good with the ball at his feet.  We'll see! 

LB - **Davies** Younger than Rose, as good as (if not better) than Rose.  **Rose** Goal against arsenal. **BAE** LOL, but seriously his best times are behind him.  **Fryers** Can play CB, but probably not in the EPL anytime soon.  

CM - **Dembélé** Strong, great dribbler but can make mistakes defensively.  **Paulinho** Is good in a lot of areas, like Dembélé... but they showed last season that they shouldn't be paired together, imo. **Bentaleb** Young, calm on the ball, good passer... his future seems bright.  **Sandro** Strong defensive midfielder that likes to take the ball from the other team. **Tom Carroll** Bit of a cult figure, but he's young and a good passer.  Less defensive than Bentaleb.  

AM/Wingers - **Eriksen** A fantastic, young player.  Great technique, great dribbling, great asset to the team.  Probably starting behind the striker or out left, but likely to roam.  **Lamela** Phenomenal dribbler and was a massive signing for us.  I love him.  Primarily RW, but you'll see him roam. **Holtby** High energy, attacking midfielder.  Fan favorite and could breakout this year.  Might move back to CM or wide right, but unknown now.  **Townsend** Fleet-footed winger.  Another possible breakout player.  **Lennon** Usually bright and took off in AVBs first year, but kind of took a step back last year.  

ST - **Adebayor** Can give you the spectacular or the frustrating.  May be transferred before next year, but who knows.  Hope he heals soon (Currently fighting Malaria).  **Soldado** Not a great season, but he was always strong in build-up and he could easily perform this season.  We'll see.  **Kane** Young and promising, but as with young and promising players... it could go either way.

From the Guardian article:

&gt;In this case the integrity of the well was not compromised and there were no leaks or danger of contamination.

If well integrity is maintained then there are no risks.

&gt;Pure speculation. Yes, it's true, methane naturally occurs in some acquifers, some of which are areas where fracking is occurring in the US and elsewhere; however, since no one took baseline readings, it's not possible to say that this is the case.

So you're saying it's reasoned speculation based on the best possible evidence we have? Thanks :)

&gt;Certainly, anecdotally, many landowners are certain this is what has happened in their experience, and scientific analyses are also corroborating this.

It's amazing how fast people can become certain of unprovable things when there's a big pot of money around the corner.

&gt;Nonsense.

Come on, not this again. You can claim that this is some kind of super potent fracking not available when *we* were young if you want, but it's still fracking and we've been doing it since the beginning of the oil industry.

Lambert came in for 4m as a backup striker (loves the club and a cheap signing)

Lallana came in 25m (seemed like Brendan's first choice signing)

Markovic was a highly rated winger/attacking midfielder at Benfica who Chelsea had been interested in. We took advantage of a third party owner wanting to sell their 50% stake to get him for 20m Euros.

Lovren seems to have been our first choice defensive target and he's come in for 16-20m depending on who you believe.

Emre Can was at Leverkusen on one of Bayern's dodgy ""we'll sell him to you, but if he's any good we're taking him back"" deals. We got a sniff of the details of his release clause and picked him up for about 10m.

**Outs:**

Aspas is out on loan to Sevilla. I think I heard something about a 1m loan fee but could be wrong.

Gerrard went to Bayern for 10.5m.

Luis Alberto is on loan at Malaga.

Some South American twat went to Barecelona for a few million, too.

**Other movements:**

An 8.5m move for Loic Remy broke down yesterday when he failed his medical

Negotiations for Sevilla's Alberto Moreno (Left Back) broke down with Sevilla wanting 25m, but so does every negotiation before it's suddenly back on again.

Reina is back at the club for the moment.

We tried to sign Alexis Sanchez, but he wanted to go to Arenal and/or live in London and there was nothing we could do about it.

We have apparently been negotiating for Atletico Madrid's Manquillo (Right Back) on a 2 year loan with option to buy (and then Atletico have another option to buy after that or some nonsense). Very confusing transfer.


Think that just about covers it.

**IN**

**Rickie Lambert:** Striker from Southampton. 4 million pounds, former academy player for Liverpool and from Liverpool. Will wear number 9 next season. Age: 32. Back up for Daniel Sturridge as we'll most likely be playing 1 main striker this season. 

**Adam Lallana:** Midfielder from Southampton. 25 million pounds. Solid midfielder, technically very good and fits into Rodgers system as he can play on the right,left or centre in a midfield three. Age: 26

**Emre Can:** Versatile midfielder from Leverkusen. Can play in many different positions. One for the future most likely. 10 million pounds. Age:20

**Lazar Markovic:** Attacking midfielder, mainly played as a winger. He is one for the future as well but also has experience of playing in Europe. 20 million pounds. Again he fits in Rodgers system. Age:20

**Dejan Lovern:** Central Defender from, you guessed it...Southampton!! One of the best centre halves I saw in the league last year, defence is an area we needed to strengthen. 20 million pounds. Age: 25. 

**Pepe Reina:** returned from loan.


**OUT**

**Luis Suarez:** Sold to FC Barcelona for around 65-75 million pound, fee not officially announced. He bite a guy. Age: 27

**Iago Aspas:** On Loan to Sevilla. That corner against Chelsea meant Rodgers had to send him into exile for a year. Age: 26

**Luis Alberto:** On loan to Malaga. Didn't really impress. Age: 21

&gt;The insulting version of the gesture (with the palm inwards) is often compared to the offensive gesture known as ""[the finger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_finger)"". The ""two-fingered salute"", also known as ""The Longbowman Salute"", ""the two"", ""The Rods"", ""The Agincourt Salute"", and as ""The Tongs"" in the West of Scotland and ""the forks"" in Australia,  is commonly performed by flicking the V upwards from wrist or elbow. The V sign, when the palm is facing toward the person giving the sign, has long been an insulting gesture in England,  and later in the rest of the United Kingdom; though the use of the V sign as an insulting gesture is largely restricted to the UK, Ireland, New Zealand, and Australia.  It is frequently used to signify defiance (especially to authority), contempt, or derision.  The gesture is not used in the United States, and archaic in Australia and New Zealand, where the [finger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_(gesture\)) tends to be used in such situations instead.

You can only get ISAs IIRC on certain Mutual Funds or ETFs, I never investigated wether an ISA account would cover equities, but it may be a good idea to ask. 

I have a trading and ISA account with them, unless you have a job, meaning you end up paying tax on earnings, there is no value of an ISA. I had two funds, a FTSE 100 tracker and an all share tracker, sold the 100 one for +10% after 9 months. But here's the problem, as its a mutual fund, you cant just sell there and then, the fund manager only does traders at certain times, so it can get queued, and you may end up with a lower price. =/

You're human, so you have some sort of health care covered ;)

If you're at QUB, there are lots of good clubs and societies to suit most interests - that might be a good place to start depending on what you're in to.

[SHAC](http://www.shac.org.uk/) might be able to sort you out with somewhere temporary to stay while you're looking for a house-share. Ormeau and Stranmillis would be my 2 recommendations.

In terms of active vs. passive, the difference is one of energy. Active implies you need to generate the flow rate, which makes it hugely bad.

Finally, the flow of all of the rivers on the planet is a pretty unhelpful term when you're considering the vastness of the ocean, and harvesting beds wouldn't need to be in areas of hugely strong current, just tidal currents along a tiny percentage of coastlines would generate far more flow than all of the rivers on earth.",0,1406567214,null,0,false,0,cja58wg,t3_2bxf6i,t1_cja58wg,t1_cja4icb,null,1434941644,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

There is a grammar error in the first paragraph.  There is singular/plural disagreement in the above quote.

Additionally, the only other sentence in the first paragraph has stylistic issues.  Although it's technically acceptable to have three independent clauses in a sentence with weak connectors, it is not particularly strong from a style standpoint.  Consider using three sentences instead of this one Frankenstein sentence, or at least having stronger connections between the clauses.

I will not read the rest due to my issues with the quality of the writing itself.  Good luck.

true,religionisanger,null,null,"Hargreaves lansdown are always good for trading. Typical advice is usually drip feed an ISA wrapper (you don't pay tax on it). 

I have some other advice, the first one is REALLY important. Never get emotionally attached to shares, people constantly think shares will do well or recover and they don't. Just because you've spent money, doesn't guarantee it will be successful. If you've got the balls setup [stop loss](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-lossorder.asp) at 10%, this takes out the emotionally attachment people have to their purchases.

My next piece of advice is don't buy big expensive shares like Facebook, you're looking for big deviations in percentages for big bucks (buy low sell high is a massive cliche, but good advice). It's also worth keeping in mind you pay stamp duty on your shares and there's also a charge for none FTSE shares. Again if you've got the balls for it, look at AIM markets for big percentage deviations - high risk, high reward.

There's a handful of shares people recommend which pay high dividend (e.g 5%), if you can afford and don't mind the moderate risk it invest lots of money into these for long term savings. If for example you put 5k into national rail, you'll get around £200 a year dividend, this can be DRIPped back in to buy more shares (dividend reinvestment). HL will only do DRIP when a dividend reaches £200. Search for pension shares for a list of the low risk, high div shares; they are national grid, unilever, astrazeneca, GSK, diageo).

In my eyes shares are divided into three categories, the high risk ones you keep an eye on daily and sell when they get high/low - they need constant observation, they're aim and risky markets. The returns can he huge, but so can the losses. The next market is medium risk, shares in the FTSE 250 which have a moderate level of volatility, things like tesco, easy jet, dixons. They have good/crap days. Then there are low risk shares which constant perform at a steady level. They are the FTSE 100 shares, the ones I've mentioned previously; the only incentive to invest in them is high dividend or talk of change which may make them drop/expand significantly.

Goes without saying; don't put all your eggs in one basket and understand you may lose a lot of money (probably not all of it though).",0,1406569058,null,0,false,0,cja69iy,t3_2bwgwa,t1_cja69iy,t3_2bwgwa,null,1434942038,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2

true,robdabank,JE,jersey,"Martinez absolutely has a reason to make these assertions. 

I agree with you, managers aren't in the business of making baseless transfer promises. But consider Everton's situation.

Everton are into the Europa league this season and who have they brought in?

James Milner, and a 21 year old Muhamed Besic. 

Look at what Laudrup did when Swans made it into Europe. He brought in almost 20 players either permanently or on loan. Over half of which came in during the summer window.

Martinez can't lose in this situation, making idle claims that the club is going to secure Lukaku. He's in a spot where the media are speculating Lukaku's departure because Chelsea have brought in two strikers. Past behaviour from Chelsea suggests that Lukaku will either be loaned out or sold. As far as journalists are concerned, Lukaku probably won't stick around for another term.

So Martinez says that he'll be able to snatch Lukaku away from Chelsea, because for all intents and purposes, your average Everton fan and journalist sees him as a player on the fringes at Chelsea. That's good because Everton have done fuck all to gird themselves for playing in four different competitions - supporters have to be worried. Look at their neighbours who have done all but outright buy Southampton for the sake of having squad depth to play in Europe again.

It looks good. Martinez is trying to add a crucial piece to his squad, a fan favourite, and a player who looks fed up with the club he's at.

But it's hedging. Offset the risk of not being able to land another striker by linking yourself with the ""easiest"" target. 

Everton can't afford Lukaku, Chelsea have all the cards here. He's got two years left on his contract and he's valued well above £15m. The latter figure being the record fee they paid for Fellaini six years ago. So when the deal inevitably falls through Martinez can say something like ""Chelsea don't want to let go of a player who they never use"" or something, and nobody is mad at him for trying to liberate a player who played more at Goodison than at The Bridge.


Then again, you could be right. I don't think Martinez truly believes he's going to land Lukaku. Whether it's to get the attention of the board, or to make himself look busy in the twilight of the summer window I couldn't say.

It makes it impossible to criticize the party views because the nationalist believes his country to be the best in the world.

* The Thick of It and In The Loop (You'll need a relatively well-founded knowledge of the British political system and some of the Blair-era spin stuff all the way through the most recent phone-hacking News of the World stuff, but it is highly enjoyable and well worth your time. In The Loop is a film with the same actors and some of the same characters who set about to start a war.)

Obviously. But the fact a rule exists doesn't make it OK. This is where I simply cannot understand your viewpoint. Parking shouldn't be simply about enforcing rules, it's about making the roads a better place. Right now we have a situation where those rules are made as such that it's simply about revenue generation. Otherwise you wouldn't give someone a ticket for having their wheels 2inches over the line and where there is another 20ft behind that car. Common sense no longer applies. It's punitive and revenue generating.

There used to be a time before these regulations came into force where you had to be blocking the road or creating a problem of some kind before you would get a ticket.

&gt;Do you take Palestinian refugees to be defined as people displaced

i take this number because the United Nations High Commission on Refugees and all the international treaties on Refugees have applied this definition of ""Refugee"" to over 100 million people around the world since WWII : a refugee as only the first generation, the status is never passed to further generations and if the person gets a new citizenship they cease to be a refugee. 

You are telling me that only in the case of Palestinians and no other people on the planet this status gets passed t endless generations without end, even to those who have had 3rd country citizenship for multiple generations? Just in order that the numbers should keep growing and growing and growing forever? That Palestinians so-called refugees get different rules from the rest of humanity? That is crazy.


-------------------------------------------------------------
Palestinians are equal in Israel

Yes there is some poverty in Israel among both Jews and Arabs and Israel is not a utopia. Differences in funding for the Arab sector also need to be addressed. 

There are also some wealthy Israeli Arabs, and many Israeli Arab towns and villages are beautiful, well maintained with nice homes. Most Israeli Arab towns look like Israeli Jewish towns and it is hard to tell them apart other than the writing on the shop signs.

example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ov8gt6yiq8s

But you started out comparing Israel to Nazi Germany and now you are reduced to complaining  about a claimed 30% funding differences for Arab villages vs Jewish ones. Not exactly the 3rd Reich.

 &gt;How many Palestinians or muslims are there in the Israeli government? 

Thousands and thousands of government workers, judges, police, firefighters, military officers, Members of Parliament, dozens of judges including Salim Joubran who is on the Israeli Supreme Court, etc.

&gt;Is there an Arabic language university in Israel? 

Arabic is an official language in Israel. 

The percentage of Israeli Arab citizens  in Israel is 20%.  The University of Haifa is 30% Arab. the Techion ( a world leading Science institute with 5 Nobel prize winners) is 20% Arab, many dozens of top professors are Arab, the Technion Medical school is 30% Arab, and the Medical school class valedictorian for 2013 is an Israeli Arab Female. 

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/diana-bletter/guess-whos-valedictorian_b_3602610.html

All Israeli universities have large numbers of Arab students.

&gt;How integrated are the communities? 

Jerusalem has over 300,000 Arab residents, Haifa and Tel Aviv Jaffa have about 100,000 Arab residents and cities like  Lod, Acre, Ramle, and Eilat are very mixed as well.

Every hospital has Arab and Jewish patients and doctors and nurses completely mixed with no distinction at all, public places, restaurants, transport, business, universities etc all discrimination is illegal under strongly enforced laws forbidding discrimination.

&gt;the Israeli military? 

Most Arabs do not want to serve for religious reasons so they can as volunteers. So they get to attend college at 18 while Jews are drafted for 3 years.

I know, I know... Chelski this, Chelski that. But the current board has really made a folly of things over the past several seasons. They are as much to blame for the mess as Big Sam, but much more to blame for the media circus that surrounds the whole ordeal.

It shouldn't be forgotten that the board has put us on a path toward profitability after inheriting massive debts. The move to the Olympic Stadium should usher in a new era for the club, one with more butts in the seats at lower prices, hopefully. But while some of the changes are for the better, some of them have also very clearly been to increase the ""sell value"" of the club. Changing to that dreadful crest was a marketing ploy, make no mistake.

The board is going to do everything they can to increase revenues, because it makes the selling price higher. This often isn't what's best for a blue-collar fan base and has included some very difficult pills to swallow. Keeping Sam was one of those pills. They make that pill all the harder by constantly undermining him, however, and that is their fault not Sam's.

Keep: Sandro, Capoue, Holtby, Schneiderlin, Dembele

So here's the thing. The way I look at it, Poch can start one of two strategic pairings in the CM: Defender and b2b, or b2b and a more advanced midfield. The first pair works well against stronger teams, the second against weaker. Sandro and Capoue are obviously the better defensive players, while Schneiderlin and Dembele can fulfill that b2b, channeling role. Finally, Holtby can fit in when we want to run a more advanced pairing. Paulinho, while I still think he's a strong player, overlaps Dembele's skill set way too much. Carroll, while awesome, needs more experience. Bentaleb I'd consider keeping to cover Schneiderlin's position, but I think we could do without him, and thus should let him get more playtime.

I had a long discussion with him about it and the negative connotations that the flag had and he really didn't have a clue. There is still the myth about how the south was before the war that is not grounded in the reality of how the south really was. I think in a lot of ways those myths will always be part of the south. After talking with my friend about this he thought about it and the next day the flag was gone but through some ungodly reason ended up in my room because my roommate thought it looked cool but that is a whole other story. 

I don't know if you can completely divorce the moral dilemma of slavery and the economic problem of slavery. Like most things it falls into that grey area where one can't trump the other as the reason. As far as the Abolitionist movement goes yes there where some that saw slavery as a strictly economic problem but it was Fredrick Douglas and the publication of Uncle Toms Cabin and countless other things that introduced the masses in the north true misery of slavery that gave the movement the thrust that it need to start change.

In the case that Schneiderlin arrives, I believe, unfortunately, that it will force Sandro out and cause the departure of at least one other of those 5. Preferably Dembele; my reasoning is that Holtby and Capoue have made statements with their abilities during the US tour and I think Paulinho has yet to show us everything he can do. As for the other 3, I think it would be beneficial to loan Bentaleb out and get him some sufficient playing time in the EPL or in the Championship. As for Carroll and Mason I can't say for certain but it might be wise to move one of them on.

""Islamic Jihad"" is the official name of one of the largest political and military organizations in Gaza. It ran in elections under the name ""Islamic Jihad"" and has members in Palestinian parliament under this political name. 

It has over ten thousand armed fighters in its armed wing and is responsible for shooting many of the rockets at Israel as it publicly claims.

Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for many of the worst suicide bombings  of Israeli civilians.

---

&gt;The insulting version of the gesture (with the palm inwards) is often compared to the offensive gesture known as ""[the finger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_finger)"". The ""two-fingered salute"", also known as ""The Longbowman Salute"", ""the two"", ""The Rods"", ""The Agincourt Salute"", and as ""The Tongs"" in the West of Scotland and ""the forks"" in Australia,  is commonly performed by flicking the V upwards from wrist or elbow. The V sign, when the palm is facing toward the person giving the sign, has long been an insulting gesture in England,  and later in the rest of the United Kingdom; though the use of the V sign as an insulting gesture is largely restricted to the UK, Ireland, New Zealand, and Australia.  It is frequently used to signify defiance (especially to authority), contempt, or derision.  The gesture is not used in the United States, and archaic in Australia and New Zealand, where the [finger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_(gesture\)) tends to be used in such situations instead.

Stocks and Shares ISAs will hold both equities and Mutual Funds providing they satisfy HMRC's criteria.  Looking at TD's website, I can't see any restrictions they impose that would stop your trading either.

The main appeal of an ISA is the ability to shelter against Capital Gains Tax (CGT) which is imposed when a holding's capital value appreciates above the CGT threshold.  This has nothing to do with your income which is taxed separately.  However, UK dividends will not be taxed at a higher rate and any income or income distribution will be paid Gross in to the ISA, so there are some benefits with regards to your income tax bracket.

With regards to the way Mutual Funds are priced, this is known as Forward Pricing and is not unique to TD.  All brokers and platforms trade in this manner.  Any price you see for a Mutual Fund or Unit Trust will be the last valuation and when trading you will receive the price at the next valuation point.

true,Hughdapu,lfc12,,"you cannot judge a player on 45 minutes of preseason, thats insane. 

i was so excited to see him make his debut that i basically just watched him everytime he was in shot. 

imo he looked understandably a little nervous, you could tell by his body language at the beginning. Also a large factor was the return of Jose Enrique the human wrecking ball (so glad he's back) and obviously they have never played together before... so learning each others game takes time, especially when Markovic still cant fully communicate with his team mates.

What was also interesting was his similarity in positioning to Raheem on the opposite flank, they both stuck out wide when we broke, and hugged inside when Olympiakos had possession in our half. Its good to see from this he's intelligent enough to cover and press, which is a big bonus from a young talent.

As someone below said, he's not the finished article, but he's a very young player still. When he was involved with play his touch was nearly always exemplary and he looks incredibly comfortable on the ball. It was also a joy to see him counter in our system, its so obvious why Brendan wanted him so bad, he's LIGHTNING quick as balls, and has great balance. If and how him and countinho line up next year is going to be so exciting, cant wait for that.

All in all I was impressed, without trying to sound too biased. The most important thing is that he develops and grows, and we've got a lot of exciting moments to come from him. Watch him go from strength to strength.

Not only is their comparison chart useful, but the blog itself makes for some interesting reading.

If you are seeking a broker who offers a comprehensive list of securities as you've described, there are a few points to highlight.
Due to changes in regulations, the majority of providers offering Mutual Funds will now charge an ongoing fee (although a handful still do not).  There are some providers who will offer equity only trading and whilst they do not accommodate for your needs, they tend to be the cheapest.

When trading international securities, unless the broker is able to hold USD currency, there will be an additional charge for converting from GBP to USD and back again.

Finally, brokers will charge a transfer out, per holding in most instances, which will be applicable should you wish to change brokers without selling your holdings (also known as in-specie).

Falcao was before he got two serious injuries to his knee? Falcao has only ever had two serious injuries and both of which happened way after he was 21, one of them was last season. At 21 he was playing for River Plate and never really made a name for himself till he was a Porto.

As good as Costa is and as much as I think he will be a success with us at Chelsea, he's only made a name for himself this past season and a half and before that his goalscoring scoring record was far from impressive. At 21 he scored 8 goals in 34 appearances in the La Liga for Valladolid.

Suarez had only just signed for Ajax when he was 21 so his goalscoring record throughout all of his Ajax years are irrelevant. The season before joining he scored 10 in 29 for Groningen in the Eredivisie. It's funny how Lukaku really isn't as talented as we think if he joins Everton yet Suarez was for having a much worse goalscoring record at that point and in a much worse league and then joined a team that wouldn't finish higher than Everton if they was in the Prem.

At 21 Lewandoswki did have a fairly decent goalscoring record, in the polish league, he then joined Dortmund at 22 and scored 8 in 33.

Benzema is 26 and isn't as good as Lukaku, the guy's so average. Although I will accept your point about Benzema, he was the goldenboy, I just personally think he's average.

Fuck the top 4, if we can smash and grab wins/draws against them that's cool, but's it's the other 15 we need to constantly get results against. 

We finally have a competent manager - AVB wasn't for us, at all. Neither was Tactics Tim. We have a manager that will work our players in training, ruthlessly with EPL proven tactics. In flashes during Pre-Season I saw football that I've not witnessed since 'Arrys Spurs. That constant pressing from the word go, forcing players into mistakes like Holtby/Kane IIRC in our last game. Fluid, fast, attacking like Soldado/Lennon's goal. A new signing in Lamela (basically), a resurgence of Capoue, who was *the* best DM in France before he joined and can firmly be one of the best in the EPL. A year for them all to settle, with a stable LB (so no Vert or Naughton out of position) and Lloris/Vertonghen on long term deals. A new stadium is on the way, and our Youth sides (I follow them a LOT) are tearing it up in our new, state of the art training centre. There's plenty future players there that can break into our first team and England setup. We never get considered for our Youth, but we have some crackling lads in their now.

I'd be delighted with constant Europa finishes for now, building our profile bit by bit (it's still Europe!) with the lure of a CL spot at the end of it. I don't want this pressure of TOP 4 TOP 4 on the club, I want us to gradually build, get the new stadium up and bring through some of our talented youth, many in and around the youth setup for England. We still have players like Cebellos, Pritchard and Mason, Pritchard I think is on Ward-Prowse's level just Southampton have much more faith in their youth as a result. He's just as deadly from set pieces too, if not moreso. 

Winks (just signed his deal - always got rave reviews, I think he can break the first team).

Oduwa (cheeky goal in Ledders testimonal, excelled in the number 10 role for England under 17's and was voted Man of the Match vs Germany)

Walker-Peters, 

Lesniak, 

Marcus Edwards (Eng under 16's/17's) *or Marcus Edwards, of Tottenham Hotspur, in the Under-16s, who lights up in the role in the hole, the systems and the technical approach now apparent in the national teams are the same. England is bedding in a new DNA right down through the age groups – hopefully for ages to come.*

Alfie Whiteman, (eng under 17's GK) 

Ogilvie (England under 17's, looked a BOSS)

William Miller, (Eng under 18's, midfielder)

Josh Onomah 

Shay Harrison over 30 goals in our Under 16's. Scored 4 recently IIRC vs Chelsea under 18's when we beat them 7-2

Cameron Carter-Vickers (new Caulker/King, played for the Under 18's at 15 and BOSSED IT. Seen training with the first team)

In terms of money, there's usually no cash machine (and if there is it will charge to get money out and probably run out). So take plenty. Your budget may vary but gear is normally ~£20/item and food is about £10-£15. Alcohol is £4/pint ish.

 [**Governance of the Gaza Strip**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governance%20of%20the%20Gaza%20Strip): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;The __governance of the [Gaza Strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip)__ was carried out by the [Hamas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas) administration, led by [Ismail Haniyeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh), from 2007 until 2014.  The Hamas administration was often referred to as the __Hamas government in Gaza__.   

&gt;The Hamas party won the [Palestinian legislative elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_legislative_election,_2006) on 25 January 2006, and Ismail Haniyeh was nominated as Prime Minister,  establishing a Palestinian national unity government with [Fatah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah), which effectively collapsed when Hamas and Fatah engaged in a [violent conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah%E2%80%93Hamas_conflict). After the [takeover in Gaza by Hamas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_for_Gaza_(2007\)) on 14 June 2007, Palestinian Authority Chairman Abbas dismissed the Hamas-led government and appointed [Salam Fayyad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salam_Fayyad) as [Prime Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_Palestinian_National_Authority).  Though the new government's authority is claimed to extend to all [Palestinian territories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories), in effect it became limited to the [West Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank), as Hamas hasn't recognized the move and continued to rule the Gaza Strip.  Both administrations – the [Fatah government in Ramallah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah_government_in_Ramallah) and the Hamas government in Gaza– regard themselves as the sole legitimate government of the [Palestinian National Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority). The international community and [Palestine Liberation Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization), however, recognize the Ramallah administration as the legitimate government. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]

&gt;Since the division between the two parties, there have been conflicts between Hamas and similar factions operating in Gaza, and with [Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel), most notably the [Gaza War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_War_(2008%E2%80%9309\)) of 2008-2009. The radicalization of the Gaza Strip brought internal conflicts between various groups, in events like 2009 Hamas crackdown on [Jund Ansar Allah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jund_Ansar_Allah), an [al-Qaeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda) affiliated group, resulting in 22 people killed; and the April 2011 Hamas crackdown on [Jahafil Al-Tawhid Wal-Jihad fi Filastin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahafil_Al-Tawhid_Wal-Jihad_fi_Filastin), a [Salafist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salafi) group involved in [Vittorio Arrigoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vittorio_Arrigoni)'s murder.  

&gt;Negotiations toward reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas, which were mediated by [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt), produced a preliminary agreement in 2011, which was supposed to be implemented by May 2012 through joint elections. Despite the peace plan, Palestinian sources were quoted in January 2012 as saying that the May joint elections ""would not be possible"". In February 2012, [Khaled Meshal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaled_Meshal) and Palestinian Authority President [Mahmoud Abbas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Abbas) signed the [Hamas–Fatah Doha agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas%E2%80%93Fatah_Doha_agreement) towards implementation of the 2011 Cairo accords, though Hamas officials in the Gaza Strip expressed their discontent and ""unacceptibility"" of the Doha agreement. The Hamas government handed over power to a [unity government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_government_of_2014) on 2 June 2014.

a) Their government funding is being dramatically cut

and

b) People don't want to pay more council tax.

With that being the situation, it makes sense for them to generate revenue by introducing arbitrary regulations. 

Personally I'd rather see increased funding to councils and I'd be happy to pay higher tax if it meant increased services.

I think I got lost somewhere along the way making my point, but I'm not advocating arbitrary parking regulations. Any rule for which a person can be fined or prosecuted for breaking should be justified. Arguably such things have the  benefit of reducing congestion, as many people will think twice about driving (although I admit it would be naive to suggest that this is in any way the main reason).

Sweets and food are already covered. Big supermarkets have small American sections and there's no shortage of businesses like Cyber Candy or American Soda who actually operate in the UK so there's no dealing with import charges to be dealt with by the customer.

Electronics also a bit dodgy in that warranties don't apply once you've sent it abroad so if it breaks, you're fucked. 

Also if you're not buying wholesale, by the time you've added on your margins, charged the customer for postage, and once they've paid all the import fees, there's probably very little benefit to a UK consumer. £15.01 worth of chocolate from the USA put in the post becomes £26 (VAT plus the £8 Royal Mail charge - no duty on that value) and that's before your profit and whatever you've charged for shipping. So probably more than £30.

RB ain't happening unless we sell Johnson and his wage demands mean that doesn't seem particularly likely even then there aren't a lot of amazing FBs kicking around so finding one of sufficient quality and experience would be another £20m+ signing and personally no realistic names spring to mind.

I think another wide player would hinge on Borini leaving and that seems less likely now.

true,Nickini,null,null,"We played 57 games last season. There would be *plenty* of opportunities for him to start, and his chance was clearly coming. But instead, he didn't get what he wanted immediately, so he asked to go on loan. 

&gt; Azpi is a completely different kettle of fish. He hadn't proven himself in the EPL the previous season to the degree that Lukaku had; he didn't have the same claim to start in the first place.

Azpi had a fantastic first season with us, but a RB will never get the same attention as a striker, and he was somewhat overshadowed by Zabaleta and Rafael. It's difficult and pointless to compare a striker and a defender anyway, but how on earth can you say someone who'd performed well for West Brom has a better claim to start for Chelsea  than someone who had already secured themselves a starting spot the previous season?

&gt; To me, it proved he could score ~20 league goals a season (not this 22 goals in all competitions crap that Torres managed starting every game). I guess you'd rather believe that Torres and Ba were amazing in training, and then just became shit in live game situations, .

I was using training as an example as to why you can't just declare Lukaku ""deserved"" to start, as you have no idea how well the players perform there. Just because he played well for West Brom does not prove he will play well for us at all. We play different styles, not to mention strikers seem to struggle with us generally. Just look at Ba - scored 13 goals in 20 apps in the league for Newcastle, we bought him in January, and he only scored twice more in the league that season. What's to say Lukaku wouldn't have done the exact same? One good season on loan at West Brom is good start, but does it prove he's good enough to start for Chelsea? Fuck no. To prove he's good enough to start for Chelsea he needs to play well for Chelsea. Playing well and scoring in the substitute minutes he was given would be a good start.

&gt; instead of thinking that maybe, just maybe, Jose made an error of judgment

Except this isn't just on Mourinho. It's on Lukaku too. Lukaku was the one who asked to leave. Unless you're suggesting the club/Mourinho just gave in to the demands of a 20-year old who'd had one good season on loan?

I have to disagree here. We performed EXTREMELY well against teams below us last year, and got trounced by the top 4. Our 11 losses included Arsenal twice, City twice, Liverpool twice, Chelsea once, so that's seven losses to the top four right there. Our only point against those teams was a draw against Chelsea (under AVB, no less). So against the entire rest of the league we lost four, won TWENTY-ONE, and drew five. A 21-5-4 record is about as good as you're going to get against any opposition, and I don't think we can realistically hope for better than that. No, it's our record against the best teams that must improve.

&gt;The __Southern District__ ([Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language): מחוז הדרום‎, *Mehoz HaDarom*; [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language): لواء الجنوب‎) is one of [Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel)'s [six administrative districts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Israel), and is the largest in terms of land area as well as the most sparsely populated. It covers most of the [Negev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negev) desert, as well as the [Arava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabah) valley. The population of the Southern District is 1,086,240 and its area is 14,185 km^2.  It is 79.66% Jewish and 12.72% Arab (mostly Muslim) and 7.62% Others (mostly Russian Christians). The district capital is [Beersheba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beersheba), whilst the largest city is [Ashdod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashdod). Beersheba's dormitory towns of [Omer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omer,_Israel), [Meitar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meitar), and [Lehavim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehavim) are all relatively affluent, whilst the [development towns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_town) (including [Sderot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sderot), [Netivot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netivot), and [Ofakim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofakim)) and the seven [Bedouin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negev_Bedouins) cities are lower on the socio-economic scale.

I can see him being used in midfield this season or as a wing back whilst we have that Italian and Warnock still in the team and I really think he'll thrive in a role higher up the pitch. Has good pace and ball control and can get up and down the pitch brilliantly as he showed in that game against Tottenham in his first season where he tore Bale a new one and ran him ragged. 

Only issues I potentially see are his decision making (can definitely be prone to a dodgy tackle or two) and his final ball but those are things he will improve on and learn. 

If we manage to keep hold of him this season and we still struggle I think we will probably take a decent offer for him at the end of the season if clubs are still interested. ",0,1406576494,null,0,false,0,cjaafss,t3_2bxu49,t1_cjaafss,t3_2bxu49,null,1434944115,3,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,3

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; You mean the strathclyde polis that had significantly lower complaint numbers than other Scottish forces?

The widespread perception is that they had a far more aggressive mentality and a high impact approach to policing when compared to Lothian &amp; Borders or Grampian, which is a problem for many reasons.

&gt; They also don't exist anymore. 

Yes I know, more's the pity.

As the largest constituent force in Police Scotland, they were always going to be shouting the loudest in the amalgamated force and they were widely expected to attempt to push Glasgow solutions onto other areas of Scotland where different approaches were taken.

The licensing of saunas in Edinburgh was one such solution where the locals were happy, the punters were happy, the council were happy, the Police were happy (or as happy as they could be) and the working girls had an environment away from the streets where they could work in relative safety.

Prostitution is always going to happen; always has and always will. 

Why fuck up a system and impose a Glasgow-style system of zero tolerance when nobody wanted it?

&gt; EDIT: I've actually ran into them a couple times in my 25 years in Glasgow.

Likewise.

Individual officers are by and large ""OK"", but the force as a whole had an approach to policing that might have worked in Glasgow in certain situations, but was neither wanted nor welcome elsewhere.

true,HorriBliss,,"I don't really like sausage rolls too much sure, so fuck yee'z!","I'm not gonna give away the recipe but my Uncle is the owner or two kebab shops.

One of them is *Tandoori House* up in Glengormley.  His house-sauce is legendary in the area, people like it so much that there is another kebab shop in Whitewell called *Shaheen Tandoori* (owned by a family-friend) and the flats directly above them order from Tandoori because, in their own words: ""The house sauce is fucking too good, mate"".

I think each shop makes their own house sauce which is why there isn't a 'standardised' and bottled product.

The reason I'm not gonna give away with recipe is because I don't have a fucking clue what is in it.  Other people always made the sauce: a 20-litre bucket would do two-three days, but that shit went quickly.

So aye, there ya go.  

There was an old co-worker who left my Uncle's shop and made his own around the corner with the same house-sauce recipe (cunt) but his shop was closed within a year because it did fuck-all business. 

Hopefully that helps?

A few of the ingredients were: lots of chopped onions, garlic, mixed herbs, coriander, and lots of other stuff, that I'm not sure of.  

See the way it worked was you make the easy bits: chop the onions, throw in the liquids, and then add the different mixture of herbs and spices (they were pre-made in wee containers) and just dollop them in and grind.  He made the mixture of herbs and spices himself so you didn't really know the different quantities.

&gt;__Liquorice__ or __licorice__ (/ˈlɪk(ə)rɪʃ/ ___LIK__-(ə-)rish* or /ˈlɪk(ə)rɪs/ ___LIK__-(ə-)ris*)  is the root of ___Glycyrrhiza glabra___ from which a somewhat sweet flavor can be extracted. The liquorice plant is a [legume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legume) that is native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is not botanically related to [anise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anise), [star anise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_anise), or [fennel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fennel), which are sources of similar flavouring compounds. The word *liquorice* / *licorice* is derived (via the [Old French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_French) *licoresse*) from the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language) γλυκύρριζα (*glukurrhiza*), meaning ""sweet root"",  from γλυκύς (*glukus*), ""sweet""  + ῥίζα (*rhiza*), ""root"",   the name provided by [Dioscorides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedanius_Dioscorides).

The easiest way to find out who is employed and who is self-employed is to get this information from the taxman - if you're self-employed as a sole-trader or a partner, you have to register as self employed with HMRC. 

You don't do this if you're running a limited company. For tax purposes, you are a full-time employee.

You'll usually have to fill in a tax return, but lots of normal full-time employees have to do this too, so that doesn't really mean much.

Having said that, a lot of small business owners don't bother setting up as a limited company because it's a pain in the arse - the tax paperwork is a lot more complicated, and really needs an accountant to help you fill in.

true,EmpyrealSorrow,null,null,"Totally depends on what kind of life style you're up for!

If you're an student and/or fancy living a student lifestyle then the best places are going to be Kensington or Smithdown. These will have student flat share apartments (3-6 or more people) and should be relatively cheap... With associated quality and crime rates. Handy with too links into town (bus 20 mins to 1 hour depending on time of year/day)

Just next door to Smithdown is Toxteth which has really outgrown its rundown 80s image. Some fantastic flats are available near to Sefton Park (eg Ullet Road) but you'd expect to pay a premium for that. Same kind of links as before. Some areas are still a bit dodgy (eg Princes Park, Princes Avenue... A strange mixture of cultures that IMO doesn't really meld all that well)

You can live just outside of town where there are good links on Merseyrail. This really does open you up to some of the worst areas (eg Old Swan - AVOID!) but also some really great places (Crosby, Formby - lovely beaches but these are a good 20-45min rail journey from town. Merseyrail is good, by most standards, but doesn't run late into the night if you're interested in night life). Anywhere along the southbound rail route - Brunswick to Hunts Cross - is pretty nice and avoids most of the dodgy areas. A good idea may be to check crime rates if that's something you're worried about (and is a problem in Liverpool)

Finally and something I'd recommend, is the city centre. Its reasonably expensive (2-bed flat about 600pm excl. bills, at least) but its so handy and you don't need to worry about travelling. There are some lovely flats thanks to the urban regent (but Deco have a look first if you can) and there are plenty of places just outside the main club areas (Matthew St and the Bold St/Seel St areas) that you won't have too many sleepless nights.",0,1406579550,null,0,false,0,cjac60y,t3_2bz177,t1_cjac60y,t3_2bz177,null,1434944933,2,false,Liverpool,t5_2r21z,2

What you mean is that Israel does not allow them to farm directly up against the border fence because some  little Hamasnik monkeys have a habit of doing all sorts of monkey business when you let them do that, like for example shooting through the fence at bright yellow well marked children's school bus on the Israeli side of the border killing children inside.

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/07/israeli-school-bus-gaza-missile

&gt;""An anti-tank missile fired from the Gaza Strip has struck a school bus in southern Israel, wounding two people, including one child critically, according to Israeli officials.""

So we don't let them farm right up cozy next to the border so they can't shoot rockets into Israeli school buses or lay landmines and IEDs to murder  Israeli border patrols on the Israeli side of the fence.

In any event modern farming does not need huge amounts of space. you probably have a cartoon like image of some simple peasant farmer pulling a plow with a donkey out of some fantasy of Palestine out the 1920s.

In actual fact Palestinian farmers use the most cutting edge Israeli high tech agriculture like drip irrigation, Israeli greenhouses, Israeli developed plant species, Israeli fertilizer and pesticides etc., all of which Israel allows Gazan farmers to import in unlimited quantities, and they do not need all that land right up to the border fence to easily be able to grow more than enough for all their own needs. 

This whole concept of needing every centimeter of arable land is an antiquated something out of the previous century that does not take into account modern 21st century agricultural technology that enables enormously high production in small spaces.

source: https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/news/middle-east/4353-gaza-=


&gt;As the Gaza Strip has self-sufficiency in vegetables and fruits, the Palestinian Agriculture Ministry announced on Sunday that it stopped all agricultural imports except bananas and apples. This decision, the ministry said, came after the domestic produce became able to fulfil consumers' needs in the local markets with reasonable prices. Bananas and apples imports were not stopped as their produce is still limited and cannot meet the markets' needs.

&gt;Gaza produces about 70,000 tons of fruits annually; twenty five thousand of citrus, seven thousand of grapes, 20 thousand of olives, ten thousand of guava and five thousand of dates. It also produces more than 300,000 tons vegetable every year.

Large gas stations are expensive to build (£600m+) and fuel is very expensive now.  

Whatever you may feel about the politics, turbines have added new capacity that helps keep the lights on.  In December it was up to 10% mostly from new turbines and the fuel cost £0.  Offshore wind may be shockingly expensive to build but can use very abundant free fuel.  

Also, small scale generation does not have to be only wind.  There are lots of ways to burn gas that are better for the consumer than massive power stations...

There is some good news however, with £10m record signing Brown Ideye (a striker who has experience at Champions League level), and the free signing of Joleon Lescott who will be important in strengthening our defence, which was simply not good enough last season. That being said, quite a few of our fans (me included but maybe I don't speak for everyone here) would be happy just to avoid relegation next season so we can continue building our squad in the Prem. Its hard to predict our line-up for next season as I don't think Alan Irvine knows our strongest 11 yet but here's my best guess:

But last season is not useful in determining that, since he was only 12-15 months out from the injury and hampered by the usual niggling injuries that result from getting back on the field before regaining full fitness.

Dembele is another matter.  I love Dembele before the hip injury, but unless there is a surgical remedy for that injury, I don't think we can rely on him being fit, and we definitely can't expect him to be the player that he was before the hip issue arose.

But the question is: why is infant mortality stuck at about 15 to 20 deaths per 1000 births across Palestine, Jordan, Egypt etc no matter all the modern medical aid available and down around 1 or 2 deaths per 1000 in Israel and other western countries?  You can easily Google for yourself and find out why.

You can in no time find dozens of medical studies published in major peer reviewed medical journals like the Lancet and Harvard Medical Journal, written by Arab and Palestinian physicians stating that infant mortality in the Arab word and with the Palestinian in particular is associated with tribes that practice incest marriages, 

example: http://www.reproductive-health-journal.com/content/6/1/17

Journal of Reproductive Health 2009, 6:17  doi:10.1186/1742-4755-6-17

&gt;Arab populations have a long tradition of consanguinity due to socio-cultural factors. Many Arab countries display some of the highest rates of consanguineous marriages in the world, and specifically first cousin marriages which may reach 25-30% of all marriages. In some countries like Qatar, Yemen, and UAE, consanguinity rates are increasing in the current generation. Research among Arabs and worldwide has indicated that consanguinity could have an effect on some reproductive health parameters such as postnatal mortality and rates of congenital malformations. 



ie certain Arab tribes have a tradition where first cousins have been marrying for 6 or 7 generations in a row or even longer. It causes recessive birth effects to be amplified.  This is a known problem across the Arab world but certain Palestinian tribes in particular are well known for practicing incest for hundreds of years. That is also why the rates of mental retardation, deafness and blindness are higher in Palestinian children than Jewish children. 

Although allowed in the bible Jews abolished first cousin marriages about 1000 years ago, so even though we Jews have our own set of genetic disorders like Tay Sacks disease, we have lower infant mortality than Palestinians.

give you the correct notice

give you proof they’re pregnant

have worked for you continuously for at least 26 weeks up to the ‘qualifying week’ - the 15th week before the expected week of childbirth

Continuous employment

Continuous employment is when an employee has worked for one employer without a break.

The length of continuous employment gives certain rights to employees, including:

maternity pay
flexible working requests
redundancy pay
Continuous employment is calculated from the first day of work.

What’s included
Some breaks in normal 
employment still count towards a continuous employment period. These are:

SICKNESS, maternity, paternity, parental or adoption leave
annual leave
employment overseas with the same company
time between unfair dismissal and an employee being reinstated
when an employee moves between associated employers
military service, eg with a reserve force
temporary lay-offs
employer lockouts
when a business is transferred from one employer to another

So because he didn't start for 4 games (despite getting more minutes than anyone else bar Torres) you feel it fair to conclude he wouldn't start any of the remaining 53 matches we ended up playing last season...just lol.

""when he should have""...based on what? Do you not see that doing well at West Brom does not necessarily mean he will do well/deserves to start at Chelsea? Players shouldn't be starting for us based on merit with a previous club, he should be proving that he deserves to start for Chelsea at Chelsea.

&gt; Dave also only had competition from Cole, and if he didn't break into the first team, he could at least learn from Cole. Lukaku had more competition for his position, and didn't have the same learning opportunity; none of our other strikers play the target role well enough to mentor Lukaku. So Dave had numerous incentives to stay that Lukaku didn't, beyond being snubbed by the club.

Azpi wasn't contesting with Cole initially though, it was Ivanovic, it was through his hardwork that he managed to secure a spot in the starting 11, even though he was playing out of position. Even though he was starting the previous season, and now he suddenly wasn't, he didn't ask to go on loan, he stayed and fought and won a spot on the first team.

&gt; Dave at all stages of his career was duly rewarded for his efforts; the same is not true of Lukaku. 

Like that one time Lukaku didn't start for 4 games? #justice4lukaku

&gt; Your comparison with Ba is fucking stupid...

My point was more that strikers generally struggle with us, we need a fairly specific type of player to work. Drogba only scored 20+ goals in all competitions for us twice, but no one would disagree he was one of, if not the, best striker we've ever had. I agree Ba probably would have performed better with a run of games but you'd still have thought he'd have done slightly better than 2 goals.

&gt; Lukaku asked to leave because he wasn't getting the minutes his performances at West Brom deserved

If we'd signed Lukaku from West Brom that season, do you think he would have started those four games straight away? He was essentially a new player on the team and was being eased in. And again, playing well for West Brom ≠ successful at Chelsea. Plenty of players fail to make the jump from a smaller team to a big team (e.g. Young, Moses etc.). 

&gt; That isn't his fault; it was Jose's decision to play other strikers instead of him, and none of them worked out well over the course of the season, while Lukaku went on to have another stellar season...that is 100 per cent Jose's mistake.

You say yourself that Lukaku didn't give Mourinho an ultimatum - so how was he supposed to know not starting him for 4 games would lead to him requesting to be loaned out? Perhaps in hindsight Mourinho should have started him, then he might not have left, but again, playing well for Everton ≠ successful at Chelsea (although I do concede a successful loan spell at Everton after one at WBA is very promising). 

&gt; That is a smart, professional decision for his career and future at Chelsea. Get. that. through. your. head.

Well it's now looking like he doesn't have a career and future at Chelsea, seemingly because Mourinho is unimpressed by his unwillingness to fight for a spot last season...oh the irony.

&gt; since it was clear to everyone that Jose was not going to start him regularly.

Once again, 4 games is in no way representative of 57 and it's completely ridiculous to try and claim so.

As for the employment part, there's a couple of ways of going about it. I personally had a fairly good idea of the sector I wanted to work in and tailored my cv to that as well as contacted a lot of recruiters through LinkedIn. Eventually I got a job about 6 weeks in and I'm still there today. If you're not fussy about what work you do you'll find the opportunities are everywhere here, and far easier to come by than at home. Sites such as reed, linkedin, monster etc should get you an entry level position in many companies fairly handily. Best of luck!
