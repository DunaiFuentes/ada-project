Edit:One solution could be a boycott of the sandwich bar, then offer the owner a reduced price when he's not making any money (It might be considered snide, but knowing these small villages I'm surprised this hasn't already happened).

There are other pubs in the village, but you have one shit hole, one posh place with fuck all space in it that does food and one really posh hotel. The new place people go to is about a mile out of the village up a hill. The Hathersage inn was the Hathersage inn and it's irreplaceable, it was next to the cricket pitch for a start then you have the fact that it's 300 years old and after 20 years of collecting his cheques he could not give the village a week before selling it to developers.

* My least favorite episode would have to be probably the first episode of Season 1. It was such a weak opening to the series, I thought it was somewhat pitiful. As I began watching DW, I watched that episode first. Instant turn off from the series. It wasn't until I watched Blink on YouTube that I saw the greater potential in the show.

* Rose. She's just a girl with the dream. She's the only one that left her life, inflicting pains on others back home, making her selfish. She saw the Doctor and basically said to hell with everyone else, I'm going with him. Ever other character eventually went home independently (except Donna, but there were times that you could see she missed her family and wanted to spend time with them.

* I'll have to leave the actor up to Moffat. It's difficult to see the good acting in a audition. You would have to think about their personality and think, ""Okay, how will so and so preform? How will their personality make that version of the Doctor unique? How would they portray the Doctor? How could we make him special?"". It would be very difficult, in my opinion, to choose one, but not impossible. It would be very interesting to have a female actor play the Doctor, even if it's just for a season or two. I think it would be cool to see how females could work playing the character, which would open the possibility of actors much wider and more unique and different, if successful. One person I would like to see as the Doctor, though, is Nicholas Cage (I'm sorry, Reddit has changed me, and yes, that's a joke, don't actually want to see him play the Doctor). However, if I were Moffat, I wouldn't go to big time celebrities, they would treat it as just another role. I would go to the small ones, the undiscovered, the ones that have great potential, but don't get chosen because they'd rather have some bigtime celebrity chosen. My reasoning for this is that they would embrace the role more, they would truly due the best that they can do, and make the most of it.

Part of this could be a cultural difference, with more working class people eating out there whilst it's considered more middle class here, but that would be replicated here by different governmental policies that implemented the same tax on the multinational supermarket conglomorates as the locally owned eatery.

And I don't disagree that eating out should be taxed.

&gt;

&gt;The **Seventh Doctor** is an incarnation of [the Doctor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who\)), the protagonist of the [BBC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC) [science fiction television](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television) series Doctor Who. He is portrayed by [Scottish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland) actor [Sylvester McCoy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester_McCoy).

&gt;Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old [Time Lord](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Lord) alien from the planet [Gallifrey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallifrey) who travels in time and space in his [TARDIS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS), frequently with companions. When the Doctor is critically injured, he can regenerate his body; in doing so, his physical appearance and personality change. McCoy portrays the seventh such incarnation, a whimsical, thoughtful character who quickly becomes more layered, secretive, and [manipulative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_manipulation). His first companion was [Melanie Bush](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanie_Bush) ([Bonnie Langford](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnie_Langford)), a computer programmer who travelled with his [previous incarnation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_Doctor), and who is soon succeeded by troubled teenager and explosives expert [Ace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(Doctor_Who\)) ([Sophie Aldred](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Aldred)), who becomes his [protégée](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prot%C3%A9g%C3%A9e).

&gt;The Seventh Doctor first appeared on TV in 1987. After the programme was cancelled at the end of 1989, the Seventh Doctor's adventures continued in novels until the late 1990s. The Seventh Doctor made an appearance at the start of the 1996 movie before the character was replaced by the [Eighth Doctor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Doctor).

true,femalecharacter,rose,Rose,"I am a fellow femme Doctor cosplayer who was at Gallifrey One this weekend and, I admit, I do find these cosplays to be problematic.  I'd like to try and explain where I'm coming from so you can hopefully understand that not all of the negative reaction is coming from a place of hate.  Fandom is love, and I support your right to express your enjoyment of Doctor Who however you like. &amp;lt;3  I think you should feel free to be as sexy as you want to be and I do NOT support this ""fake geek girl"" fan policing.  (I think the idea of there even being ""real"" fans and ""fake"" fans is silly.  But for me, if you are at Gally, you're a legit fan.  Period.)

My issues come from a place of thinking about gender representations in media.  I spoke with other femme Doctor cosplayers at the con and I know I was not the only woman who saw their cosplay as a kind of resistance to representations of women in Doctor Who.  I can't speak for all other female Doctor cosplayers, but many were vocal about how they were disappointed by the lack of female Doctors.  By representing the protagonist of the show while also presenting as/dressing like a woman, we challenge the idea that a woman could not be the lead of the show.

There have assuredly been some kickass female characters on DW, but often, especially recently (*cough* Tasha Lem *cough*), the plot and their characterization has reduced them to a pretty face who is attracted to the Doctor.  (Why, why does every woman on the show want to bang Eleven??)

So, for people like me who are going in to the convention thinking these things, it is disappointing to see a femme Doctor cosplay that reinforces the link between female characters and women's roles as sexual objects.  As Playboy is most widely associated with straight male readers, bunnies represent an offering up of your body to the male gaze specifically (as opposed to just being beautiful for yourself.)

I know this was not you intent, but the costumes can almost be read as trivializing the idea of a female Doctor, making it seem like a novelty or joke.

I hope that makes sense, and I hope you can understand how someone could find the link you have drawn between Doctor Who and Playboy to be troubling.

(Just so I am very clear, I think these costumes are fantastic.  Undeniably excellently constructed.  They are also very clever crossover cosplays that you look absolutely gorgeous in.  My problems are purely wibbly wobbly feministy weministy.)

TL;DR  I'm all for sexy fans in great cosplay, but I worry about the message this particular cosplay sends in regards to the role of women in Doctor Who.",0,1392783806,null,0,false,0,cfiyph3,t3_1y6tbi,t1_cfiyph3,t1_cfi5pj1,null,1432460477,-1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,-1

Aston Villa chief Paul Lambert insists there is no rift between him and axed defender Matt Lowton.

Lowton, 24, failed to make the Scot’s squad for their match at Cardiff last week - and he was dropped for last month’s trip to Liverpool after turning up late for training.

It comes after the ex-Sheffield United man missed just one league game last term in what was his first season in the top flight - the high point being a goal of the season screamer against Stoke which proved key to the Villans’ survival.

Lambert said: “I just left him out. I had to pick a team that I thought was right.

“He’s been fine. I don’t want people writing I’ve fallen out with him, because that’s nonsense.

“There’s no such thing.”

The striker, 18, plays seven steps below the Premier League with Ryman One South side Folkestone Invicta.

Villa have sent scouts to watch Ter Horst, who has scored 17 goals this season, and are mulling over making a bid.

But competition for his signature is fierce and they are one of SEVEN clubs in for the talent.

Charlton, Brighton, Sheffield Wednesday, Brentford, Gillingham and Wycombe are all interested in giving the youngster a Roy of the Rovers style move.



Ter Horst is under contract until the end of next season and would command a fee.

Starsport understands that Invicta will not stand in his way if a pro club came calling but a permanent deal - with Ter Horst loaned back to Invicta for the rest of the campaign - could be in the pipeline.

The pacey Ter Horst - who has been likened to a mini Michael Owen - was close to quitting Folkestone last year.

But he chose to defer his university entry to stay on with the Kent club.",0,1392784126,null,0,false,0,cfiyumr,t3_1ybaet,t1_cfiyumr,t3_1ybaet,null,1432460544,1,false,avfc,t5_2s569,1

I hang out with guys like Tennant, not always as big as him, but even with the one I see regularly dealing with ""fans"" can be a pain in the ass for the person.  Almost everyone truly adores and appreciates their fans and when the time is appropriate, will give their all to give back to them.  But there are definitely moments, and the example you listed is a prime one, where they just want to be left alone.  If she simply yelled one thing towards him, that would even be okay.  He could briefly acknowledge it without it interrupting anything.  But demanding that, and EXPECTING to be noticed, is an awful thing to do.

I wouldn't go so far as to feel bad for Tennant, or my friends and acquaintances, though.  He/they have gotten to live out a life long dream, have wonderful families and lives, and get to do what they love most as a career.  Girls like that exist for all of them, and definitely ruin moments, but those are mere moments compared to everything else.

but again, you have/are doing the right thing.  If you see him again and he's close enough/not busy, just extend a hand and let him know that you really appreciated his role in Doctor Who (and mention something else, perhaps one of his plays, most actors love that sort of thing) and just tell him it's a pleasure to meet him.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Sadly, I was unable to watch the game live since I had tennis practice after school. However, I practiced with my phone in my pocket and was following the gamecast updates. This led to a number of near heart attacks for me (though I'm sure watching live caused many more). 

The first came when Iniesta scored Barca's second goal. I read the update on my Gamecast stream, and naturally I was crushed. I then received and update on my phone from another app wrongly crediting Messi with the goal. This caused me to believe that we had gone down 3-0. At this point I figured there was no chance of us coming back and it was time for me to focus on tennis practice....
..... until I get the update telling me that Ramires had scored and the score was 2-1. Just like that, the score goes from what I had thought was 3-0 to what was in reality 2-1, ahead with the away goal.

The second heart attack came when El Niño scored the winner. I knew that the game was almost over, and was anxiously awaiting to see the FT update. At this point I had been reprimanded several times by my tennis coach for lacking focus. I just needed to see that damn 'FT'. But instead of 'FT', I see what I had been dreading the entire half.. 'GOAL!'. I had been wishing so badly for all 45+ minutes to not see that word, that I didn't notice it was really us that had scored. Having thought that Barca had just scored the winner in the 90th minute, I dropped my racket, and nearly abandoned practice right then and there. When I received the update from the other app and learned that Chelsea had indeed advanced, I went absolutely apeshit.

If you mean driving licence, then as other have said you have a year (in automatics only probably) to take a UK driving test if you can drive manuals or you can exchange for an automatic only licence.

Personally I would recommend taking a few driving lessons anyway, and if you go to an instructor who specialises in ""foreign nationals"" getting a UK licence they can teach you the differences in driving over here quite quickly, and they will know more about the licensing situation.

As a mechanic, I would suggest that you would need a full licence in order to move cars that you are working on that have manual gearboxes - it'll be easier on you to know how to drive a manual car even if it isn't a legal requirement.

In general terms, you'll be fine citizenship wise as long as you can support yourself for a while whilst job hunting, but look more closely into the NHS situation - there may be a period where you don't qualify for free care due to you being non-resident for so long.

By restricting the sale of public houses, and refusing to consider a change of use when they've been on the market for an age without any serious potential buyers, you're basically letting the community dictate the price at which they wish to buy the pub, fucking over the publicans.

There's literally no prospect of obtaining a mortgage or business loan for a pub at the moment.  This means to sell a pub you either need to get lucky and find somebody incredibly wealthy to take it over, who will not need a loan, or the local community needs to take it over.  The first option is completely unrealistic.  Which leaves only one: letting the community buy it.  But if there's only one possible buyer, they then have a license to dictate terms and prices.

Ironically, this move will end up damaging pub culture in this country more than helping it as publicans are put off taking on pubs.

&gt; In theory I can see villagers making a rota, with each member tending bar after work once a fortnight, but I'm dubious

In theory.  In reality, villages and villagers are prone to rows over trivial things and running a profitable pub means you get up at 6.00am and don't shut until nearly midnight, not something that can be taken on lightly.

Members of all parties across the house were complicit in the activities of this group.  It does need to be investigated as it will expose just how ingrained abuse of vulnerable people was / is in our society.  In the early 80's when I was at school a teacher sexually abused pupils. We all had heard the stories. But when one victim reported him to the female head of year he was greeted with the response ""go away you stupid little boy"". So that was the type of response you got when you went for help. The boy went to the police and the teachers was tried and found guilty of offences against 4 boys. He was given an 18 month suspended sentence. So a convicted pedophile who abused a position of power was left free.  As a result of unrelated instances of abuse one of my friends turned to drugs and finally killed himself. So the view that it might not be harmful is a hard one for me to contemplate accepting. 

However, I do think it was a very different time. Homosexuality was only legalised in England for over 21s a few years earlier and not until 1980 in Scotland, 1982 in NI. So many people committed illegal sexual acts that we now consider normal.  Against this backdrop it is easier to see how the age of consent could get caught up in a wider debate of sexual morals.  If sex between two men over 21 was deemed unnatural, was sex between an 18 year old man and a 14 year old girl more or less unnatural?  The age of consent is an artificial  construct, for example it's 13 in Spain, 14 in Germany, 15 in France.  There needs to be an age of consent to protect children but at what age it is and the surrounding laws are clearly not universally agreed.  
My personal view is that it should be changed but banded.  So people within the same age group are able to legally have sex. Currently a 16 year old having sex with a 15 year old would be classed as statutory rape. There may be only a month age difference. A 30 year old having sex with a 15 year old would more likely suggest an imbalance and possible exploitation. So I would actually raise the age of consent to 18 inline with alcohol and tobacco, after which you are a consenting adult. But between 15 and 18 create a consenting person if both parties are within 3 years of each other.

Mirallas---Barkley/Ossie---Pienaar

                Naismith

That's a more likely lineup if you ask me. Barkley has been playing below par recently and really needs to start making better decisions to keep that starting spot. Ossie is more experienced in decision making so I might consider starting him.

Naismith on the other hand somehow just keeps getting goals when he comes on so I say he starts, hopefully he can make some good runs and maybe get lucky and bag another one. (He did last time we played Chelsea). Bring Traore on at 60-70 minute mark with fresh legs and the defense will get absolutely rolled over by him since they're getting somewhat tired already. 

McGeady has yet to prove he should start so obviously Mirallas and Pienaar are better choices to start on the wings.

To me it seems teaching has changed radically, so many teachers are relaxed and informal. some even encouraging the use of their first name. There is a huge gray area as to whether a 15/16 year old is an adult in my opinion. they have the body of an adult, they have a mind of an adult (in my opinion) and just have the remnants of child like personality traits to shake off. I my self would never have a relationship with a 15/16 year old even if they were mature enough to make me think they were my age, 18, just because i know within my peer group it would not be accepted. it is incredibly dificult to be 15/16 as you are constantly told to grow up, or be a child while you can. your not legally allowed to act like an adult when it comes to drinking, gambling, smoking. yet you are expected to act like one. I feel for the teachers in this, especially Jeremy. he looked after her, he did know what he was doing was wrong in the eyes of the law and the majority of society. but i believe the world is changing so fast are laws always going to be able to keep up with whats acceptable and whats not? is society always going to be right? i think he has been branded as a pedophile/vulture praying on the vulnerable by brain dead newspapers such as the sun.

1. Sturridge.
2. Coutinho.
3. ...
4. ...


Then you've got guys like Miggy and Sahko who still need time to assert their success in the shirt. Which doesn't mean they've been bad. It just means it could still go either way.

Then you've got signings that have, to this point, not worked out at all.

2. Borini.
3. Aspas.

Those two lads can certainly come good and frankly the failures to now could too. 

But we certainly don't have an amazing track record. Point being that these signings are never guarantees and the way people lose it when we lose out is beyond ridiculous.

Half the people listed in this thread so far are people we've been linked with in the past 5 years. For whatever reason, even with people whose careers have stagnated, people still think we should get them.

I honestly don't know who we should sign. But I think positions we need to fill are at fullback, backup striker, and maybe a backup winger.

But, to an extent, don't Aspas, Alberto, Borini, Allen, Suso, and right on down the line need to get more chances? It doesn't mean we shouldn't sign a top player if they're available. But I also think we've seen the effects of giving players time to thrive.

Henderson, Sterling, Flanno, etc. 

Especially when the player is young and was supposed to be good. Why would we fill up our team with 15 million pound maybes that could be as good as players on the bench.

Nearly everyone on this sub wanted a LW or RW this past summer and winter because it seemed Rodgers did. But what fucking good would that have done but stifle the amazing ascension of Raheem Sterling. The lad, at his age and with one more PL season under his belt, could be worth 40+ million pounds if sold within the PL. And here's everyone pissing themselves about two unproven Ukranians who haven't been snapped up by anyone while close or at their mid 20s.

And yes, he did shag quite a few.  At least one girl a year.

*What damaged these girls' lives far more than actual the relationships was having to hide them, then go on the run, then go through the whole police and court proceedings with the associated publicity.*

I find myself wondering if a better strategy would be to simply fire the teachers. Prison forces them apart physically, but at what cost?  Is Jeremy Forrest truly more of a danger to society than some violent thug who gets a suspended sentence and fine in the magistrate's court?

I'm not saying these relationships should be condoned.  But I suspect in a lot of cases that if they were - if there wasn't quite so much thrill of the forbidden and secrecy driving them on - most would burn out a lot sooner.

&gt;The Club has been in contact with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in Kiev. For fans travelling via Kiev and train, they have confirmed that the fast train is still not operational but other trains are. Fans need to take extra care if in the centre of Kiev and the FCO advises that you go straight from the airport to the Station for transport onwards. Roads in the centre of Kiev are blocked with traffic as the Metro is not working.

&gt;Once again we would stress that fans should take extra care at all times and continue to check both the Club website and gov.uk for updates.

Sort of reads like the team isn't really encouraging supporters to take in this match, not openly discouraging supporters from going but not exactly saying it is a great idea either. (one of the guys on SC just pointed out that with the fast train down the slow train will take 7 hours to get from Kiev to Dnipro which in itself would seem to be a discouraging fact to plenty of people).

Still haven't seen any word on the Valencia match which is being played in Kiev a very short distance from the square where the violence is occurring.  Carrying on with that match seems like an exceptionally bad idea, i mean putting 20K+ people plus police in a small area in a city that is engulfed in violence doesn't seem to all that well thought out.

We went to bars and nightclubs from about the age of 14. You just bought fake student ID for £5 from a bloke in the student union of the local sixth form college.  We were pretty ""well brought up"" and didn't do a lot, but we were there, looking 18+, even though we were all minors (sub age of consent minors). We absolutely knew what we were doing.  We didn't give a thought to some guy of 18, 19, 20 who we might flirt with in terms of compromising them legally.

This was also the era that Sam Fox did Page 3 at 16 (and I believe there was some speculation that her earliest pics or at least her portfolio pics were taken at 15).

That wasn't what I got from him at all, he stated that the same reasoning could apply to anyone who looks at wikileaks. The crossing borders is implied, given the context of the discussion. The 'downloading' part is implied because *that's what your computer does automatically whenever you look at anything on the web,* have you not heard of a browser cache? Furthermore, as deleting a file does not mean that the file has been deleted, merely that the blocks used for that file can be overwritten when needed, even clearing your browser's cache is not enough.

Furthermore, even if wikileaks material is not found, if they have identified you from their wikleaks tracking operations, mere suspicion is all that is required to detain you, as long as you are carrying or transporting a device that could reasonably be thought to contain such materials.

If you are carrying a tablet or mobile phone, they could then choose to make your life more difficult under the RIPA key-disclosure statute, where it is a crime to refuse to disclose your decryption keys. Did you know that the average Android phone has several encrypted sections, for which you would not know the decryption key? Apps create their own encrypted storage, there are a couple of places where the Android OS encrypts things like account details, and then there is the Secure Element in newer Android devices.

That's like me saying that you are suggesting that the police should all have guns because then they'd be even more effective! That's not the way to argue a point.

The guy who got his eyes blasted out of their sockets is literally *the worst* case scenario so far, and that's a pretty bad scenario. Plenty of other people have been blown off their feet, had clothes and skin torn off. The UK's own report said water cannons ""are inflexible and indiscriminate"".

If the only reward you have is that that single instance of riots would have been a little bit better, at the risk of severe injury to both the rioters and peaceful protesters, then your case is pretty shaky.

Why do the police need a weapon like that in their arsenal? Are we expecting massive civil disobedience of the scale where indiscriminate jets of water won't risk hitting any innocent bystanders? Are we expecting to need to disperse protesters like the Russians do?

If your argument is that the police will only use them in ""extreme"" circumstances, then you haven't been following the news. The UK police force has shown through recent history a great willingness to use whatever means available to them to discourage and disperse legitimate protest. The accounts of kettling, literally forcing people to shit themselves on the street are numerous. Water cannons are likely to be used with reckless abandon until someone gets seriously hurt.

In any case, what does it say about our society if so many people are so pissed off that the police couldn't handle it and needed massive jets of water to blow them all off their feet?

Do you know what the Americans used it for before even they shunned it as too extreme? Dispersing black American protesters during the civil rights movement.

And that guy who is now blind? He was protesting an urban development project. It wasn't a riot, there was no looting. Why did they need water cannons for that?

This isn't about whether or not water cannons can control crowds. They are very effective at controlling crowds, too effective. But they are indiscriminate, difficult to apply accurately and amount to disproportional use of force with a high likelihood of injury to innocent bystanders. It's not that people don't trust water cannons, it's that they don't trust the people using them to do it in a responsible manner.",0,1392811985,null,0,false,0,cfj5ic9,t3_1y8at6,t1_cfj5ic9,t1_cfj56xl,null,1432463748,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,[deleted],null,null,"The problem for him is that the people of Scotland will not vote for independence on those terms because they will then be knowingly voting on a proposition that will put their current way of life at risk.  This is understandable - the Scots are not poor colonised folk living under the yoke of foreign oppression and the potential upside of independence will only be a moderate change in their environment and circumstances.  If that potential upside comes at no cost or risk then the only reason not to take it is a sentimental attachment to the idea of the UK.  

However, if the SNP are honest about the risks and uncertainties involved then most Scots won't be interested in risking what they have now in exchange for the possibility of a small improvement and the possibility of a fairly significant reduction in their circumstances.  The number of Scots who are interested in independence for its own sake and under any conditions, that is as an ideological commitment, is very very small so Salmond can't sell independence on the basis of Scotland confronting a sea of troubles and braving them together to form something new.  The only way he can win is if he can persuade the voters that nothing will get worse, nothing that people want to keep will be lost, and some things will get better.  He has to assert this as a fact and not a challenge Scotland must rise to or he will certainly lose.  The problem, of course, is that it is a challenge rather than a fact and while Scotland may indeed succeed in rising to that challenge there aren't many people who are willing to make real sacrifices if necessary for the nationalist revolution.",0,1392812317,null,0,false,0,cfj5kls,t3_1y8zfz,t1_cfj5kls,t1_cfj4qx5,null,1432463777,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

No, it doesn't.  Law and ethics are not the same thing.

&gt; We all have different moral compasses. But we all need to follow the law of the land we walk in.

I don't disagree.  But I would say two things:

Firstly, anyone who finds their moral compass aligned in totality with their local law has either not spent much time forming their own opinion about what is right and wrong, or is an idiot of the highest order.

Secondly, anyone who believes that breaking the laws of their locality is an immoral act in and of its self is clearly not making the above distinction between law and ethics.  To illustrate this point, consider a situation in which a local law mandated that you should behave in a way that is (generally considered to be) unethical.  Would it *then* be more ethical to break the law?  Or would acting unethically be the more ethical thing to do?

Back brining it back to original point the age of consent is a contentious point. There are some people who believe it should be lower some higher.  If someone is legally an adult at 18 should they face the same response from a court as a 30 year old man for having sex with a 14 year old.  
I don't know the answer, just fuelling debate.

true,pharao007,null,null,"Yeah, typical shallow thinking with ""outrageous"" fact of Brits paying for Polish children living in Poland.

* children are dependants of parents, they can't legally work;
* parents work in UK, pay UK tax and NIN, why they can't claim for their dependants?;
* Polish children living in UK and claiming around £80 p/m is probably way better than having those children in UK + costs of schools, hospitals, GPs, possibly other benefits;
* check actual cost of CHB paid for all children and compare it with the cost of those Polish children abroad, that's less than peanuts;
* very nice that Cameron and other twats take into account any social implications of families living like that. What parent would like to live somewhere far from his children? Hard choices etc... but only money saved is what matters by Mr Cameron;

In any case, that could be changed by UK government but make it fair, to all. If the same would apply for Brits (whose children are abroad) and all other nationals (without pointing fingers who takes how much - quite obviously the biggest immigration group can claim in CHB the most) then it would still be perfectly fine.

true,Raskilinov,null,null,"&gt; Why specifically, does the Care.Data database need to include every NHS patient's data, and what, if any, advantages does this give to researchers over representative sampling?

**I cannot comment on the advantages for researchers but will cover from a NHS commissioner perspective.**

Currently primary care data (i.e. data from GPs, Optoms, Dental etc) is not linked to secondary care data (hospital data). This is largely due to the coding systems used within these two levels. 

In primary care (GP) there is a reliance on READ codes, and in secondary care a mix of OPCS, ICD10, and HRGv4 codes. Unfortunately trying to marry these two systems is an incredibly difficult job, and any strategy or decision making always carries assumptions and caveats.

There is currently a NHS drive to demonstrate *""commissioning for outcomes""* ; counting treatments is no longer enough. 
 
To demonstrate and measure outcomes, the NHS will need to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment pathway, i.e. show the patient journey from primary care, through secondary care to a discharge (to either a community service or back home).  

To answer the question of only activity volumes (how much activity for treatment ""x""), can be answered using separate datasets.  

To answer the question of; *is service ""x"" worth it?* requires datasets to be linked together. 

If we can show effectiveness of pathways of care across the NHS England geography, we can: 

* Be one step closer to setting standards of care pathways across England 
* Better justify NHS service spend 
* Better justify the decommissioning of those less effective services 
* Monitor our spend with greater accuracy 
* Plan our spend with greater accuracy. 

I know that there are researchers on this reddit who have tried to communicate the benfits in care.data, but from my perspective as an instrument of the NHS, I believe care.data can enable better change for the NHS, in how it operates and spends the public purse.

Amy's life revolves around the Doctor?

That's the shmuckiest level of guy-dependence I've seen in the show. At least Amy had a job and a few (arguably positive) career changes by the end of her run, and in her last moments she decided her husband was worth more than the Doctor.

Martha was an obviously very intelligent and independent girl who was  almost ruined by being the female equivalent of the fedora-wearing 'nice guy' who stuck with the Doctor long after realizing he didn't reciprocate her feelings. And let's not forget it was under Rusty, in a Rusty penned episode, that had the infamously squicky blowjob tile scene. Donna was pretty much the only companion consistently well-presented, but that's still one out of two (or more if you take the one-off companions into account).

Now I don't think Rusty was worse as a show runner. I think he was better in many aspects of show running that Moffat lacks in. But I don't see how he's any less sexist in his portrayal of women than Moffat.

To be honest if you're a parent you probably shouldn't have a pet too. Each is a huge responsibility that requires a massive investment of time and emotion. If you have a baby the dog *will* feel rejected when you give the baby attention, and it may then attempt to assert itself to this new arrival. Sadly when this happens injury or worse can result.

The final thing I will say is that this action is almost never the fault of the dog. It is the fault of parents and dog owners who treat their animal like a person, and assume it is capable of making rational decisions. 
I love dogs, but whilst they may be a member of my family, they are not human and will behave unpredictably when faced with new situations.

It's a budgeting tool but the trick is that it doesn't force you to make sacrifices, you just have to give every bit of your income a ""job"", eg. bills, spending money, whatever.

It's really effective because instead of thinking ""oh I've spent £50 more than I expected on games this month"" you think ""I've spent £50 more on games and that's come directly out of my car insurance/fuel budget/whatever"".  

This helps you see where your money is really going. And one tip (that helped me use this tool fully) - if you overbudget it takes it out of next month's budget. Don't do this, firstly because it means you're always chasing, but secondly because it's impossible if you think about it. You can't spend next month's money this month, and by doing that you're only kidding yourself. Instead of starting the next month on -£100, take £100 out of your water bill (or whatever) and add an extra £100 to it the month after. Numerically equivalent but it means your bad months are obvious in retrospect.  

The software is around £35 but there's a free trial for 34 days to see if you'll make use of it (I recommend not starting the trial until the day you get paid, otherwise you can't really do anything).

And besides noting his disbelief that the EU will ever turn down an opportunity to have another country, finished it off with how instead of reducing speedlimits on motorways we should be looking at a UK autobahn system.

Some are on management 1-3 as they were around in the 80s when the last cull happened and they stuck around in exchange for more. A fair reward for their service. Most have been downgraded, almost all from management to the regular band such as 6, some as low as band 5. The work load is greatly increased and yet they have nurse level people assessing mental health. It's an utter travesty. 

 The Doctors themselves in mental health and other assessments get quite a lot for doing very little. The social workers actually handle the case load but not only do they get a fraction of what the doctor makes but they have had wage freezes for the last five years. 

Assessments are done based on risk and means. I can't speak to the rest of the service but in mental health that means assessing if someone is mentally ill and needs or just reacting from drugs or alcohol and needs to find support elsewhere. This is obviously not popular with those they refuse.

The problems you describe might be individuals that are poorly trained, though to tar an entire profession is pretty weak, but that would be a fault of the lack of funding. Most problems stem from very poor management in the field and the top down restructuring of the last five years led by a callous Victorian ideology.

Put it this way, if a particular policy benefits the middle-aged at the expense of the young, it's more likely to be implemented than it would have been in the past, and if a particular policy benefits the young at the expense of the middle-aged, it's less likely to be implemented, simply because the larger number of middle-aged people makes it less likely to win votes.

In his book *The Pinch*, David Willetts used an analogy to music. If you compile a list of favourite albums of all time among a random group of people and compare it to the list of favourite albums by music critics, then you'll see a strong bias towards music from the 60's in the popular survey as compared to the lists from the critics.

Not really sure what to think of such people running Liverpool. One can tell they come from a very different background and very different values to the people that ran it in the previous decades.

With that in mind I'm not overly excited about the people who run LFC. The Club itself should be the number one priority, then success, then everything else. I know I am simplifying things a lot here but that's how I personally would list priorities. On the other hand, these guys seem to be doing a lot better job than our previous ownership. At least we're getting somewhere with Anfield redevelopment and the team is performing better and better. It's all about the club though.

Freedom of speech is not some Platonic ideal that allows people to say whatever they like to whoever they like in whatever way they like regardless of how that impacts on their livelihood or fundamental human rights. People have a right to privacy, they also have a right to be informed about public sphere/political matters that will impact on their lives - there is a middle ground between ""reveal everything regardless so long as it makes us money"" and ""breaking the law to reveal important issues that effect our democracy and the public at large"". 

We're talking about shades of grey, not black and white absolutes like ""secrets are secrets"" and there's a moral balancing act involved in the exposure of any kind of hidden truths - a balance usually decided on a fuzzy concept of the public interest.

The Sun might argue that it was totally justified in the public interest for them to be hacking the phone messages of Milly Dowler's parents and the Guardian can disagree while still publishing information from Snowden/Wikileaks documents.

true,Captain_English,null,null,"It means that you can carry whatever the fuck you want in your bag and not be searched for it unless there is due cause to suspect you're carrying or have done something illegal. 

However, if they do suspect you're carrying something illegal, it'd be nice to live in a world where a) they have to specify what they think it is and b) cite specific powers granted to detain and search based on the carriage of that material or the illegal activity they suspect you of. 

Otherwise, it's a whitewash to detain and search people at will, if the detain and search powers for eg terrorism can in fact be used for almost any suspected 'crime'. This is because as soon as you remove the requirement to link a specific criminal activity to a specific individual, you also inherently remove the burden of proof requirement between an illegal activity and the special powers to remove and limit and individuals freedoms based on their likely involvement with that activity. For example, if I could be reasonably linked to theft, you could invoke anti-stealing laws to detain and search me and my property. Fine. If you can't link me (presumably, because I'm innocent - like most people in the country), but you can use anti-terrorism laws to the same effect even though there's no evidence of my being involved in terrorist activity, that means you never really need to link anyone to a specific crime again, because you've brought in legislation so flexible it can be used when there is nor proof requirement for the crime it's intended for. Well, then why would you need any proof or suspicion to begin with, ever again? 

This is basically giving law enforcement the ability to say 'you're a terrorist, I'm going to to search you, oh look what I found sunshine'. That's akin to a policeman showing up at your door, saying that he's going to search your house without a warrant, when you object he claims you're a terrorist, uses anti-terror legislation to legally enter the house, and then doesn't find anything at all. 

That's fucked up. Really fucked up. And really dangerous. It undermines everything about innocent until proven guilt, due cause, and personal freedoms. 

EDIT: Guys, don't downvote the chap I'm replying to. That's not reddiquette. He's asking a valid question which highlights the importance of specificity in law, and might help others appreciate that. 

EDIT 2: Now the crux of the matter here is that 'terrorism' is so feared in the western world that we've created legislation with further reaching affects on individuals than ever before. For example, the no fly list - you can essentially legally have your freedom of movement removed, without being put in prison or formally charged. Or you can have your every move and communication tracked, by default - even though you're completely uninvolved in terrorism. 

On top of that, we've also never had a consistent, single definition of *what terrorism is*, unlike almost every other crime listed under law. We know what theft or murder is, but what is 'terrorism' in a specific definition? 

This vaguery is present in both law and public consciousness; the definition of terrorism has been softly expanded to include essentially anyone who takes action against a government, even when that action would otherwise have been legal. As such, the definition is so wide that someone exposing illegal activities of the security services can be included in the definition of terrorism, by the weak link that the revelations could potentially allow terrorists proper to develop countermeasures to the activities of intelligence organisations, which in turn would allow them to plan and execute an attack which would otherwise have been prevented. 

This seems solid, but is actually very flimsy - there should be a requirement to actually prove that these surveillance measures do, in fact, prevent acts of terrorism, and that terrorists in turn can or will develop countermeasures to these methods, and that these countermeasures were specifically responsible for the nondetection and therefore nonprevention of the terrorist act, and that these measures are legal, or if they are legal, whether they should be or not. 

Now this link chain has never been proven (it's actually the case at the moment that this kind of surveillance has never been proven to have prevented an attack). 

Nor has it been proven that other counter terrorism methods are insufficient to prevent attacks. 

Nor again has it been proven that the countermeasure developed by terrorists are effective in entirely concealing their activity (so we might not read their emails, but we still have eg the local immam telling us he thinks these guys are trouble). 

And nor, finally, has the fact that measures are potentially illegal been discussed, or the question asked of whether we want them to be legal given their potentially limited benefit but high social costs in personal liberties. 

Ultimately, we wouldn't even be having a discussion about any of the above points if Snowden hadn't leaked his documents, which to me certifies very much that regardless of the protective marking of the material, it was in the public interest that it was reported on. Now that's not an endorsement of how he did it, only that this debate needs to happen. 

My argument would be that the security services have no right to break the law, and that if they did, it is in fact in the public interest to report it; that terrorism kills, on average, about five people a year, three orders of magnitude less than eg falling down the stairs, and that these techniques are of limited benefit in countering terrorism (even if they were responsible for 50% of preventions, that's stopping 3 deaths a year), and as such are a waste of money, time, and pose great risk to our personal freedoms out of proportion with the benefit they give us. If we took everything we invested in counter terrorism, and put it in to eg cancer or diabetes research, how many lives would be saved? I'm going to put it out there - more than five. And it wouldn't cost us any liberties, either. ",0,1392826991,null,0,1392828951,0,cfjadmz,t3_1ybyd0,t1_cfjadmz,t1_cfj8ba9,null,1432466043,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1y89dp/uk_inflation_falls_to_19/cfibbic

https://mises.org/daily/2847

But, first I think you need to watch this video that explains the banking system and inflation I am talking about -

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33RXhv0IuPc

&gt; Credit expansion is responsible for sharply increased economic inequality, in which the wealthier strata of the population appear to increase their wealth dramatically relative to the rest of the population and for no good reason.

That above quote from the article explains what is happening atm. It is that credit expansion (inflation) that means a typical family now has to have both parents working, whereas in the 70s the mother could stay at home. It is a wealth transfer that **could not happen with free association and competing currencies** because we are forced by law to use the same currency the banks are creating and using for their own ends.

&gt; Lovely sound bite, would you care to explain how this works in practice?

I think the best way is for a free-market in law based around property rights as decribed in the book The Machinery of Freedom by David D. Friedman.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTYkdEU_B4o

&gt; Lets say how I want to live is in a society with a centralised, inflationary, monopoly currency I take it suddenly your less keen on me living how I want? 

NO! I am 100% for you living how you want just as long as you don't force me to live the same way and don't take my things by force. How can we find the best system if we are not allowed to try them! It's none of my business what you want to do anyway.

It is highly likely that the system we live in today is not the best humanity can do. We have a centralised system that is able to grant special privileges to favoured groups. Meaning no group can ever be satisfied unless they take compete control of the system. With a decentralised system people are better able to serve their wants and needs.

I think it's been made obvious that it's not all about finances and I see the change in transfer policy for example as a direct result of the money overpaid on Carroll/Downing/Henderson.  Taking a strong stance helps to keep you from being taken advantage of by other clubs in the future and also BR's policy of wanting a very specific type of player while not being afraid to play the young guys has quite an influence on things as well.

I have no problem with a young, successful, finance mind pulling the strings in the background and it's a new sensible approach to balance out with the history, constant buzz, and passion I suppose for lack of a better word.  Sometimes taking a step back and being objective is the best even if it's not the most popular decision with the fan base.

true,mike2R,null,null,"Which is great news for everyone.  My favourite stating of the argument is in [chapter VIII of That Which is Seen, and That Which is Not Seen](http://bastiat.org/en/twisatwins.html#machinery), M. Frederic Bastiat, 1850.

&gt;James B. had two francs which he had gained by two workmen; but it occurs to him, that an arrangement of ropes and weights might be made which would diminish the labour by half. Thus he obtains the same advantage, saves a franc, and discharges a workman.

&gt;He discharges a workman: this is that which is seen.

&gt;And seeing this only, it is said, ""See how misery attends civilization; this is the way that liberty is fatal to equality. The human mind has made a conquest, and immediately a workman is cast into the gulf of pauperism. James B. may possibly employ the two workmen, but then he will give them only half their wages for they will compete with each other, and offer themselves at the lowest price. Thus the rich are always growing richer, and the poor, poorer. Society wants remodelling."" A very fine conclusion, and worthy of the preamble.

&gt;Happily, preamble and conclusion are both false, because, behind the half of the phenomenon which is seen, lies the other half which is not seen.

&gt;The franc saved by James B. is not seen, no more are the necessary effects of this saving.

&gt;Since, in consequence of his invention, James B. spends only one franc on hand labour in the pursuit of a determined advantage, another franc remains to him.

&gt;If, then, there is in the world a workman with unemployed arms, there is also in the world a capitalist with an unemployed franc. These two elements meet and combine, and it is as clear as daylight, that between the supply and demand of labour, and between the supply and demand of wages, the relation is in no way changed.

&gt;The invention and the workman paid with the first franc, now perform the work which was formerly accomplished by two workmen. The second workman, paid with the second franc, realizes a new kind of work.

&gt;What is the change, then, which has taken place? An additional national advantage has been gained; in other words, the invention is a gratuitous triumph - a gratuitous profit for mankind.

&gt;From the form which I have given to my demonstration, the following inference might be drawn: - ""It is the capitalist who reaps all the advantage from machinery. The working class, if it suffers only temporarily, never profits by it, since, by your own showing, they displace a portion of the national labour, without diminishing it, it is true, but also without increasing it.""

&gt;I do not pretend, in this slight treatise, to answer every objection; the only end I have in view, is to combat a vulgar, widely spread, and dangerous prejudice. I want to prove, that a new machine only causes the discharge of a certain number of hands, when the remuneration which pays them as abstracted by force. These hands, and this remuneration, would combine to produce what it was impossible to produce before the invention; whence it follows that the final result is an increase of advantages for equal labour.

&gt;Who is the gainer by these additional advantages?

&gt;First, it is true, the capitalist, the inventor; the first who succeeds in using the machine; and this is the reward of his genius and his courage. In this case, as we have just seen, he effects a saving upon the expense of production, which, in whatever way it may be spent (and it always is spent), employs exactly as many hands as the machine caused to be dismissed.

&gt;But soon competition obliges him to lower his prices in proportion to the saving itself; and then it is no longer the inventor who reaps the benefit of the invention - it is the purchaser of what is produced, the consumer, the public, including the workmen; in a word, mankind.

&gt;And that which is not seen is, that the saving thus procured for all consumers creates a fund whence wages may be supplied, and which replaces that which the machine has exhausted.

&gt;Thus, to recur to the forementioned example, James B. obtains a profit by spending two francs in wages. Thanks to his invention, the hand labour costs him only one franc. So long as he sells the thing produced at the same price, he employs one workman less in producing this particular thing, and that is what is seen; but there is an additional workman employed by the franc which James B. has saved. This is that which is not seen.

&gt;When, by the natural progress of things, James B. is obliged to lower the price of the thing produced by one franc, then he no longer realizes a saving; then he has no longer a franc to dispose of, to procure for the national labour a new production; but then another gainer takes his place, and this gainer is mankind. Whoever buys the thing he has produced, pays a franc less, and necessarily adds this saving to the fund of wages; and this, again, is what is not seen.",0,1392828369,null,0,false,0,cfjb164,t3_1yc0yo,t1_cfjb164,t1_cfj8siu,null,1432466423,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Most people are assuming the Doctor is stating his age in Earth years every time, but it doesn't have to be that way. I could say I'm 17 years old and it would be true (if we lived on Mars). The thing about a year is that its going to be different on every single planet in the universe (well, most likely....) so the Doctor isn't necessarily lying or anything like that, but giving an exact age for someone who isn't even tied to a planet in years (which are tied to a planet) is extremely difficult. To accurately give the Doctor's age it would need to be in hours or something specific ""I'm x EARTH years old""

true,-Sessions-,lfcflame,,"Mate, going through the same struggle right now. Traveling in from Los Angeles as I bought hospitality packages for that match months ago. Unfortunately Sunderland has been playing out of their minds in the two Cups so this cluster-fuck of fixtures for Sunderland has screwed us over. They have announced officially that it will be postponed but like you said there is no date for the reschedule. 

Me and my friend, who is traveling with me, thought maybe they would push it back a day or so, but we then quickly realized that 3/11 and 3/12 are UEFA Champions League dates, so no BPL games will be played then. 3/13 is a Thurs and a possibility, but with Europa League and the fact that Sunderland plays an already scheduled BPL match on 3/15, the likelihood of them playing 2 matches in 3 days is pretty much 0%. 

Soo....we emailed the booking and hospitality folks over at LFC and they promptly emailed back and said they were sorry to hear we wont be able to attend the rescheduled match but a full refund is being issued. 

You should probably get on it ASAP because we read that if you need to request a refund, it needs to happen within 14 days of the original fixture date(March 8th).

All in all, I am heartbroken and completely down-trodden succumbing to the realization that I will not be attending my first match at Anfield and hearing YNWA live for the first time, BUT....essentially two weeks off in the busiest part of the fixture list for most teams in a year where we are overrun with injuries?

It's not very hard to control a dog like that, it's just about knowing how to act and how to read them, and being consistent with your behaviour. Unfortunately a lot of people never quite get into that mindset, and still try to train a dog like you would teach a person. 

Spaying or neutering helps too. 

I think it can be helpful for children to learn how to act appropriately around animals. It's also great for their immune systems. That said, you've got to be careful with young children as they can push the boundaries for even a very calm and tolerant animal.

This season Wilshere has hardly even had a chance to play in the middle. Most of the season he's been on the wing or as a defensive midfielder due to Ramsey's amazing form.

Henderson gets to play every game in his favourite position because his only competiton is from *Joe Allen*.

That's just another reason as to why Wilshere will have a much brighter future. He will constantly be in competition to play anywhere on the Arsenal pitch. Ramsey for a box to box midfielder, Ozil as a number 10, and Walcott and Chamberlain on the wings. Constant competition will mean Wilshere will have to consistently improve if he's even to be on the pitch when everyone's fit. Where's the competition for Henderson?

Henderson is not a better passer than Wilshere....lol.

So perhaps I can understand what you are getting at if you answer some basic questions about how life would work under this system.

1. Does a state under this system have a government? Does the concept of a state even exist?

2.  How as an individual how do I provide for my family? How do I get, firstly the necessities of life (food, housing, electricity) and secondly, luxury items? 

3. How do businesses work? Free association means no ownership of means of production, so how does anything get produced? Where does credit and investment come from? Is there any credit within this system?

4. You want competing currencies, so how as a consumer do I convert whatever wealth I have between currencies? How do I know the exchange rate etc.?

5. How does such a society support those who need help (benefits, healthcare, pensions) There is no monetary value to keeping these people alive so why would anyone bother?

6. Same question you failed to answer earlier about big speculative investments. How do large speculative projects requiring huge co-operation and investment with no guarantee of return get funded/done in this society of yours? (eg. Space exploration, pure science)

7. If such a society co-habited with another running the current system how would they interact (trade, travel, foreign policy etc.)

&gt; It is that credit expansion (inflation) that means a typical family now has to have both parents working, whereas in the 70s the mother could stay at home.

Finally just need to pick up on this, a very strong argument can be made that the money a family ""requires"" has risen drastically in real terms in recent times. Consumerism and the rise of TV, mobile phones, etc. etc. mean that household outgoings to sustain a 'normal' life are much higher than in the past.

Would also be interested to see any data which shows that the rise in both parents working is down to cost of living and not improvements in female education, rights and societies view of their role.

""In seeking to frighten Scottish voters with dire predictions that the Spanish government might veto any Scottish EU membership application, he was, of course, merely mimicking identical declarations by David Cameron and the main Scottish unionist leaders. They have all stressed that Madrid would probably block Scotland for fear that otherwise the growing movement for Catalan independence would become irresistible.

But the language being used by the Spanish government does not support these dire predictions. In a recent interview the Spanish foreign minister, José Manuel Garcia-Margallo, stated that a Scottish EU application should be considered in the event of a Yes victory in the referendum. He went on to insist: ""If Britain's constitutional order allows – and it seems that it does – Scotland to choose independence, we have nothing to say about this.""

More strikingly he went out of his way to distance himself from suggestions that the Scottish and Catalan cases were inseparable for Madrid. ""The two issues are 'fundamentally different',"" he declared.""

http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/17/barroso-scotland-ludicrous-remarks

Now ask yourself a question. If Barroso and Von Rompuy know the Spanish government position as stated by the current minister why are they continually lying when asked these questions?


Edit: In relation to Kososvo the Spanish position is consistent.

true,dazzawazza,cnty-england,England," * Dogs, like children, investigate the world with their mouths. Your child's face can be part of that world.
 * When a child enters a family the dog will NOT understand it's position in the pack for some time. It is foolish to expect it to know it's not above a helpless bald shitty puppy.
 * The more 'intelligent' breeds use their paws to communicate. Malamutes, husky, Akita's are all likely to poke and prod things that interest or irritate them. A large Malamute could easily knock a crib over and injure a child. They don't need to bite to kill newborns.
 * When an adult dog 'corrects' a puppy or lower ranking dog it often bites it pretty hard on the back of the neck to tell it to stop it, standard procedure but difficult for human babies to adapt to.
 * Most dogs are under-exercised and have little idea of their position in the pack. Humans let them use the sofa, bed, upstairs as if they are a high status member leading to tension between the dog and humans. (I'm not claiming these humans did that). Stressed dogs make poor house mates.
 * All dogs learn by making mistakes and being corrected. If your dog isn't used to tiny children don't expect it to understand.

I have a large Akita that we rescued and we didn't leave her alone with any child for months until we knew her temperament AND she knew her place. I trust her a lot now but like you I would never leave her alone with an infant (that I didn't also trust). People need to be trained to live with dogs, it's not magic. If you can't read a dogs body language you shouldn't be with it alone.

All dogs can kill a child, we really are quite useless when we're young and I think the media does like to write about the bigger, exotic or 'dangerous' breeds.

Most of all this is just a tragic accident for which the parents, child and dog are paying the highest price.

This.  A million times this.  I was in my later years of school, I was targeted, groomed and sexually abused by a teacher at my school. I was too stupid to realise it at the time, should have known better, etc etc - now I'm an adult I realise that he manipulated me. Anyway, after I left school, he was caught doing the same thing with another student, and the investigation led them to me. 

At the time I was happy - someone was showing an interest in me, we talked online every night, etc etc.  My parents and friends didn't know, I made up excuses about extra-curricular activities.  It ended and I thought that was the end of it, it had been a stupid decision but now I could move on.  But when a policeman turned up on my doorstep two years later asking to speak to me, that's when the shit hit the fan.  I lied to my parents saying I was just a witness and not a victim (I think they still believe me but I've never actually told them the truth), suddenly getting letters in obvious envelopes from the courts, getting phoned at home by Victim Support, having to get public transport to all sorts of difficult places to give evidence and meet lawyers and pretend I'd just been out shopping... then long periods of radio silence where nothing happened and I just had this anxiety hanging over me - who were they interviewing? Would those people be told my name? Would they tell everyone they knew and I'd become a laughing stock in my home town?

Eventually (2 years after he was suspended and charged, 4 years after I left school) he plead guilty, meaning I and his other victims didn't need to give evidence in court.  There was reporting in the papers which couldn't name me, but descriptions narrowed it down to a small number of possible victims - I don't know if other people worked out it was me from the press coverage.  Reporters turned up on my doorstep (not many, thankfully), and when I phoned my court liason person in tears because my parents had had to turn reporters away from the house and I was scared to come home in case people would harass me, I was coldly told that **even though my name could never be published, my name was freely available to reporters through the court records, and they were perfectly within their rights to contact me**.  

It still disgusts me that vulnerable victims of sexual crime can be contacted by journalists despite supposedly being anonymous - who the fuck wants to discuss these things with journos after a stressful experience of being a witness, regardless of whether or not they ended up in court.  I'm mostly over it now, although I still get a bit panicky if I see someone who looks like him, or if things come up in the press that might lead people to search for him or try to find me.  I still feel that although I was a victim, if it is found out then my reputation and my career will be ruined.  In my case, even though I was groomed and taken advantage of, I still feel a tiny bit of guilt that I was a willing participant at the time, that he went to jail and his livelihood was taken away and would have had effects on his family, that if I had reported it he wouldn't have had a chance to abuse the girls after me (who were treated worse by him and affected more by the abuse than me).  

In my case, he was a predator who groomed vulnerable girls. He told me about how younger pupils would flirt with him so obviously, but teenagers are hormonal, sexually curious and confused, and teachers are an inevitable target.  Most of us would admit we had a crush on a teacher, and it probably wasn't as subtle as any of us thought at the time. I don't honestly think pupils can be blamed in the majority of cases, because teachers have a duty of care and a position of responsibility, and should be capable of saying no.  There are procedures for reporting inappropriate attention from pupils. If they genuinely believe this relationship is ""the one"", they should have the sense to move school (which, if the pupil is 16+, makes the relationship legal again), or wait until the pupil has left.  If they're only trying to get their end away with a ""barely legal"" who's been giving them the come-on, they deserve to lose their job for being a horny bastard.

**tl;dr: I was a victim, the trial and media coverage was the worst part, and you really can't blame the victims in the vast majority of cases because teachers know the rules and shouldn't let their genitals get in the way of them being able to say no.**",0,1392834949,null,0,false,0,cfjeb0j,t3_1yagzk,t1_cfjeb0j,t1_cfj52ey,null,1432467991,6,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,6

Also whenever he is playing we seem to be constantly scrambling in defence. Same with the Chelsea game even though he was CDM. when he's not there everything seems much calmer in the box and defence is more organised. 

As for the goal. It's true our defenders were pushing up  its ridiculous to blame Vinny for messi being onside, of course he would be when we have the ball. Demichelis needs to leave room to get back if messi does get the ball though, he can't just completely switch off. He miscalculated and couldn't get back in time to make the tackle.

Barkley? He's going to be immense and I think we all know it. A quality player already. 

Raheem has certainly had the most consistent season but Barkley has been injured and Januzaj has been the leading light in a relatively poor United team.

I understand the rationale for this design decision: it's a vehicle, a means to get from one story to another, and you don't necessarily want to show the characters at home in it.  It's also a reflection of the Doctor's personality, in that even though the TARDIS is the closest thing he has to a real home, he doesn't treat it like one, preferring to wander the universe and lean on the hospitality of others instead.

true,crucible,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt; Admittedly I don't like the system either, but the leasing companies aren't really the problem - because of the very high cost of new trains, the leasing companies are the only people with enough money to buy new stock really.

True, most of the lease cos are owned by global banks or investment firms anyway.

&gt; Right now track repairs are done by contracting companies who report to Network Rail, whose customer is the government. If this was changed so that Network Rail's customers were the TOCs then they would have to do what the TOCs wanted - better repairs faster for less cost, new routes or route upgrades/shortening etc rather than doing repairs only when the track fails to meet safety standards any more, and building fatuous new extensions that are only good for spending tax money on, and for gathering more tax once they are complete.

This is changing, albeit slowly. Look at the Network Rail / South West Trains alliance for an example. How well it will work in practice has yet to be seen, as it's a fairly new approach.

I'm curious though - what do you mean by ""fatuous new extensions""? I can't really think of any current or future investment schemes that aren't currently needed. I would go further, and say some schemes are lacking in scope - surely it would be easier to build Crossrail out to Reading now rather than attempt it in 10 years, say?

&gt; And train length extensions should be handled by the TOCs as well - the government should impose minimum standard service levels, sure, but not ""exact"" ones that limit the ability of TOCs to do their job.

I thought of another example re: Govt messing up here - a few years ago when TransPennine wanted to add a 4th car to their 185s. By the time the DfT had said yes Siemens couldn't build the cars as the engines no longer met EU emissions rules.

&gt; And the franchise system is ludicrous as well. It just encourages TOCs to plan for the near future and not beyond - they can't decide that they need new trains in 10 years if they don't know whether or not they will have the route to put the trains on.

Chiltern show what can be done when you award longer franchises. Because they got a 20 year franchise they have helped to fund massive improvements on their route (double track, resignalling, 100mph running) and have bought fleets of new trains. With common sense this should be the blueprint for all TOCs.

&gt; In the 1930s it was the job of the TOCs to build the trains, and they did a good job of it - we hold the world steam speed record for a reason. The railways spent massive amounts of money on R&amp;D, looking into things as diverse as the best grade of steel to use on train tyres (and they do have tyres) through to the most economical blend of linen for table and sleeper services. They basically looked into almost everything needed for modern life, and much of their innovation was used by the general public.

Sadly I don't think we'll see the likes of that again. Even most of BR Research was dismantled after privatisation unfortunately.

&gt; Now, TOCs use whatever they are given by the train design companies and the government committees.

Yes, Bombardier have done very well here and have got 15 years out of some of their designs.

&gt; It's relevant that you could say (as Terry Pratchett has) that the Duck-Billed platypus is a duck designed by committee - as in it's a practically useless oddity.

I hope that the IEP will not prove to be useless, but the approach seems to be ""cram as many seats in as possible"".

Here's some advice I wish I'd had when I was your age:

1. Learn to market yourself. Learn how to create a top CV. Buy a book on the subject. Or even several books.
2. Consider writing a blog about the subject you'd like to work in.
2. Learn to be confident and immaculately presented in interviews.
3. Network ! Yes, in person. 95% of success is turning up. This is true.
4. Recruiters are fine, but IMO the best / most interesting jobs are filled through networking. For a £30K per year job, the agencies commission might be £10K !! If you approach a company or contact directly it's easy and low risk for them to offer you a position
5. Have a  good profile on Linked In - use it to make contacts. 
6. Use Meetup.com to find events / gatherings related to the industry you'd like to work in. Turn up.
7. *Decide* what industry / company you'd like to work in and specifically target them. *Make them* give you a chance. I have a friend who wanted to work for a particular company - he phoned the MD every other Thursday for *months*. ""Hi, it's me again. Interview me or I'll keep calling you until you do"". When they finally interviewed him, they offered him a job the same day.

&gt;I have a lot more to offer.

Do you? What exactly? 

Write it down. Then find companies / organisations that need what you have to offer. 

Best of luck !

Now don't get me wrong. Band 6 is certainly a pretty decent wage. But compared to what someone working as a social worker with a degree should be getting it's around 15 grand shy of fair. This is because jobs previously done by band 7-Management B (Around 50k a year) are now being done by band 4-6. Not to mention pay freezes and below inflation increases. 

I have the same view with that as I do for train drivers and others who earn a reasonable wage. Don't say to them ""Why do you get more than me!? You should get less!"" Say to yourself ""Wait I only get that much, I should get more!"" The fact that we are working backwards towards lesser pay doesn't make things fairer. The super rich and high level doctors still get the same. Go after them.

Someone with a degree and the caseload of a doctor who easily get double that.

The reason I said you were tarring social workers is because you said 'social workers' rather than a social worker you know. I don't know your case or your experience. Whether they failed to attend the meetings, or were ruling without properly considering the case I cannot possibly comment on. In my experience that isn't only unlawful but also neglectful. 

You are right I did take issue. Mostly because your comment was the equivalent to shooting the messenger or victim blaming. Grouping social workers in with ATOS and management is just nonsense. Frontline staff mostly do their very best with what little they are given and fight hard to stop the pressure from ideologues in management pushing even further.

&gt;

&gt;In [Ian Fleming's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Fleming) [James Bond novels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_James_Bond_novels_and_stories) and the [derived films](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond_in_film), the **00 Section** of [MI6](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Intelligence_Service) is considered the secret service's elite. A 00 (typically read ""Double O"") agent holds a [licence to kill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licence_to_kill_(concept\)) in the field, at his or her discretion, to complete the mission. The novel [Goldfinger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldfinger_(novel\)) establishes that the section usually has only three agents at a time; the films, beginning with Thunderball, establish the number of 00 agents at a minimum of 9, with the likelihood of more.

Being in the same house as my sister after three years of not talking will be interesting. Now I need to think of a suitable 60th birthday present for the woman who claims never to want anything. 

Otherwise it's been a pretty mediocre week. My new office-mate is actually okay. She's very quiet and I think she's a bit of a bible-sort, so I'm getting lots of work done and trying to curb my language.

My job went back to my old job this week after six months which means I now work for two people again instead of one. Doesn't make me particularly happy but I may be able to do something about it in a few months. 

Feeling quite single at the moment. Don't feel it often, but the man-who-is-not-my-man shagged someone 14 years younger than him on holiday last week, and whilst I'd usually congratulate him, ask for details or tell him to stay away from the mad 'uns, this time it just made me feel sad and I didn't have the heart to comment. I'm supposed to be visiting him later in the year. Having second thoughts about that.

&gt; 

Birmingham has a perception issue with the rest of the UK. This is not something unique to Birmingham however and it happens with a lot of other cities, but nonetheless its there. Since its the second largest city in the UK it does have its share of crime. However after a quick google search there seems to be a lot of misinformation around the web with lots of anecdotal evidence. I can understand your confusion, so i'll try and keep it factual. 

Birmingham is the one of the safest major cities in the UK, if not the safest. It has been claimed that it is the safest [core city](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_Cities_Group) (the main cities outside london) more often than not ([Here](http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/birmingham-declared-the-safest-big-city-128922)). That was in 2010, doing a cursory search reveals other items (even the wiki page) that says similar things. 

The police publish [crime stats per ward](http://data.police.uk/) every month. There is a website that collects this data and publishes it a better format. You can see the data here for the police forces. 
[Birmingham &amp; surroundings](http://www.ukcrimestats.com/Police_Force/West_Midlands_Police)
The Birmingham police force (West Midlands Police) covers a population of 2.9mil. 

There are two other main forces (outside london) that cover such large population areas are Leeds and Manchester. [Leeds &amp; surroundings](http://www.ukcrimestats.com/Police_Force/West_Yorkshire_Police) ( 2.1mil)
[Manchester &amp; surroundings] (http://www.ukcrimestats.com/Police_Force/Greater_Manchester_Police) (2.5mil). The crime stats do look good in Birmingham's favour. 

Speaking specifically about crime in Birmingham, this a recent breakdown on statistics by [wards](http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/birmingham-crime-report-what-crime-6391969). If you search Harborne and Selly Oak you can check the levels there. There are basically a couple of really hot spots in terms of crime, those being Ladywood, Nechells, Soho and Aston which are the most crime ridden.

true,VincentKompanini,,Old Growler,"Ah, fair enough. No offense but I'm kind of glad you've decided not to play it. I think recently (BF3 and BF4) the teamwork element has declined among the player base of the BF games. I suspect this has to do with an influx of CoD players who are bored/sick of CoD. It means you get a load of bellends charging around who only care about their K:D ratios, taking helicopters with the sole intention of getting to sniper spots then dumping them, not dropping ammo or healing or spotting enemies. 

Basically ignoring the teamwork aspects of the game which Made BF what it was, and turning it into CoD with vehicles. If people want skill-based competitive FPS's thats cool, but BF games are about more than that.

I see your point about it not feeling like a separate game, but CoD hasn't changed for years. I guess if you're a fan you notice the changes in both franchises; they're incremental nowadays, not drastic. The changes in the games between BF2 to BC2 were pretty huge,but tailed off after that.

BF will never be taken seriously as competitive game, but really don't agree with what you say about BF just being for people who are crap at the twitchy FPS games you love. I don't think the team work aspect was born from people failing at competitive FPS gameplay; BF just wanted to offer something different.

It'll be years before I can afford a *house* because buggered if I'm going to buy a flat - if it's going to cost the earth, I'd at least like an upgrade.  I grew up in a house which was £75k in 1984 when my parents bought it, sold it in early 2007 for £680k and it's very likely worth nearly £1m now.

My employer has a London-based graduate programme with lots of bubbly ""young professional"" types.  Almost all of those who grew up in, or around, London are commuting from their family homes in the Home Counties or Zone 4 - those with no permanent base in London are renting flea pits half an hour by Tube from their offices.  There are only two exceptions I can think of who are commutable but choose to live in London, one of which did so because she fell out with her parents and the other one's got a minted family anyway.

There's one guy who will probably never have these problems, seeing as his family home is a 6 bed in a nice corner of Barnet (in fact his dad helped him get the job - well connected).  Suffice to say he never talks about buying somewhere and sees this as a first world problem.

Those staying at home generally do so simply because it's cheaper, which makes perfect sense.  I've got another friend from my school days (not in or around London) who says he will never rent and will be staying at home until he's saved enough for a deposit to buy; again, sensible chap.

I don't have a problem with that. The problem is with dogs that *are* habitually vicious and are *not* trained, they are a danger to everyone, including you, and your dog.

For broadband I found I need a phoneline. I went switched to Sky this year as I got around £200 off a 12 month contract at £40 a month for fibre BB and phone with calls. If you only make limited use of the net then you may want to consider a dongle.

For gas/electricity I find the cheapest provider using a comparison site and then find them on a cashback site after clearing cookies and get cashback. Not so much with this, usually £30 when I switch.

I use topcashback - find a friend who has a signup link so they get a bit of cash for you signing up - it takes ages for cashback to come through and I often need to raise a claim, but that's the nature of the beast.

I don't give a stuff about customer service for broadband as they're all bad if you need to contact them I'm sure, but the vast, vast majority of the time you don't need to contact them, so why pay for it if you don't use it?

As for gas/electricity then there's less of a saving from shopping around for the cheapest so you may want to entertain restricting yourself to ethical/small/good customer service companies because it won't cost you an arm and a leg. I've decided my next switch will be to one.

Finally do sort out a proper joint bank account for bills, financial woes are what breaks most friendships/relationships. You might even use it as an opportunity to get a joining incentive of around £100.",0,1392851025,null,0,false,0,cfjmpj3,t3_1ycchp,t1_cfjmpj3,t3_1ycchp,null,1432471958,4,false,UKFrugal,t5_2u4mi,4
