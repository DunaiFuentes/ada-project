true,Jamaicaman90,swans1995,1912,"On topic, I disagree quite strongly with you there. Overall, the attack looked good to me - although Montero is going  to have to quickly learn that he can't take on the world with his dribbles. The defence communicated poorly and it cost us. The third was like the one against Southampton - it should have been dealt with as it dropped but it wasn't. A few signings there and we should be OK. Gomis and Bony were a terror in combination in the first half and on another day they would have put a few away. 

I was in the crowd by the way so my view might be a bit different to people who watched on the TV. I could see some things (Gomis' superb movement off the ball) better, but other things worse. 

It was a poor performance but I think it can be resolved by making the fullback and centre back signings we are expected to. Bartley was very poor today and that made us look a lot worse than we were, in my opinion.

With the Europa league and finally away days back for the travelling support I can see us feasting off of this terrific opportunity. Lots of fans upset about our poor results/form in pre-season. I know that if we go out and play like that vs Leicester it'll be a problem, but this is football- nobody knows.Looking forward to seeing the School of Science being open once we hit the pitch on Saturday.

2. **McGeady** - watch out for him because he's a bag of tricks and is a relentless winger. He's had a decent preseason, but the creativity on the wings is going to be where Rom will really shine through in that blue shirt of his. 

**Garbutt/Browning** - I hope that these two get some regular time with the Toffees. That would be swell. They have both looked top notch this preseason. If there are any positives we're going to take from the horrendous preseason some have said we've had, it's the sharpness of our youth. I wouldn't mind putting Browning in before Hibbert at RB as Stones is just not equipped as a wing back. Garbutt's crosses are whiplashed in faster than you can say shake it up Bainesy. 

**Oviedo** Really interested to see how the lad recovers from the double leg break. He is a tireless worker and technically gifted. Costa Rican tradition will see this speedy winger/midfielder converted left back to very well at Goodison and hopefully the away grounds this year.

Also figured somebody covered **Besic** :)

If we're talking about what players to watch out for, I wanted to highlight the LM/LB/LW position at Everton. This is going to be a very important position for us and we have many players capable of playing it. Garbutt/Baines/Oviedo are all *very* confident. Still waiting to see Oviedo/Garbutt really test the waters.

Disappointing that it was our defence that was shaky, that was a weak spot under Monk last season too but I figured he'd be able to work it out better with a proper pre-season. I still think we could use another DM is Canas isn't the answer, Besic would have been great but it's a problem area at times. 

Good to hear Bony and Gomis linked up well, I like both of them individually but I have my doubts about them playing together - hopefully those doubts will be proved idiotic in time. Especially if they DO manage to show the kind of movement necessary to play two strikers like that in a system like ours. I know Wilf's quality when dropping back is underrated by those that don't watch him much, I guess I might have been doing the same with Gomis. How did the team's fitness look, overall? I hear Bony was far from his sharpest. 

Where do you think we're still short? Good to hear rumours about us getting a new LB and CB (although I wish we'd started on these moves sooner) but as long as we don't lose Bony, I think the squad's looking pretty strong; De Guzman and a DM and it'll be very good. Even if he stays at Villarreal, we're not in bad shape in midfield with Gylfi and Ki there.

Personally, I don't think we will be able to push for the Top 4 AND do well in the Europa league, I think the squad is still a tad too thin for a push on multiple fronts. So, my guess is either top 4 with an early bow out of the Europa League, or Top 6 with a good Europa League run. 

2. Number 1 has to be **Besic**. From what he has shown in the friendlies, he looks like he could be a bargain for the 4 million we paid for him. Hard tackler, good ball distribution, and surprisingly skillfull on the ball. Another would have to be **Stones**. He got 20 games last year, and played well, this year will be another chance to see if he is up to the task of taking over for Distin once he retires. Finally, I'm gonna go with **Aidan McGeady**. Fully fit based on his performance in the friendlies, will be nice to see if he can prove to everybody that he deserves to be in the PL and that he is a top quality player.

3. http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=40py6 This is my best guess for the lineup. Besic may replace Barry if he keeps up his form. The only real question is whether McGeady will play or Pienaar.

2.**stones, Besic, and Mcgeady**
Stones and Mcgeady both showed glimpses of good talent last year, however stones is still a back up to Distin and Jags, and Mcgeady never built up enough fitness last year to start, however with the extra europa fixtures, they should both see a lot more of the first team. Besic is a new signing, its his first year, our DMs right now (McCarthy and Barry) are the well established first choices, however, Besic has shown Flashes of brilliance in the preseason, and could challenge for an aging Barry's spot.

As you'll get older you'll naturally encounter less of it compared to your teenage years so that may play a factor but I think it's more a case of younger people becoming more educated and connected (even very poor people) thanks to technological advances meaning chaviness becomes less appealing to them.

When have they ever, at any point in the last seventy years, turned the other cheek?

I'm serious. The number of people who apparently feel extremely strongly about this but believe some fantasy narrative in which the poor Palestinians were bottled up in Ghettos two generations ago and have been suffering quietly ever since is astounding.

Read about the Arab-Israeli War, the Six Day War, the Yom Kippur War, the Jordanian Civil (and International Black September which followed), the Lebanese Civil War, and the first and second intifadas.

Understand that *every other country* Israel has been at war with has managed to negotiate a peace, getting back their occupied territory, *after they stopped bloody shooting.*

Understand also that despite losing *three wars* they started against Israel, one against Jordan (when they tried to take over that country), and one against Lebanon (see above), the Palestinians spent the first thirty years sending raiding parties while refusing diplomatic contact outright and the last *forty* years trying to negotiate while *still sending rockets/suicide bombers/mortars/raiding parties.*

They have **never** turned the other cheek. They have been beaten (crushed, actually) every time they've started an actual offensive, but they've been firing anything to hand at Israel for the last **seventy years** - even during the Oslo Accords, the Camp David Summit and the Cairo conference the mortars kept firing - so to portray them as poor victims of foreign aggression is simply false.

They aren't the poor kid being picked upon by the bully who finally snaps. They *were* the bully in the three wars of Annihilation they launched against Israel, but despite being kicked into the dirt time and again every time they start something they *refuse to stop shooting,* and more importantly they **refuse to stop shooting while negotiating.**

He seems to drop the word 'water' pretty quick, and then starts just calling them 'piss bombs'.

Loads of dissembling and rationalisation...

The outisde may change and parts of his personality may change, but at the core, he is the Doctor and always will be.  This is an idea that is followed up on later when 10 and 11 go back and meet the War Doctor just before he is about to activate The Moment.  The War Doctor says ""Go back to your lives.  Go on, be the Doctor I could never be.""  Ten and 11 together respond with ""All those years burying you in my memories...pretending you didn't exist, keeping you a secret even from myself...pretending you weren't the Doctor when you were the Doctor more than anyone else...You were the Doctor on the day it wasn't possible to get it right.""

What you describe is a exaggeration of the working class. All people who are working class are lower income and almost always lack further education. The exaggeration comes in the form of anti-social behaviour and the clothes they wear. 

Young lower income people with no further education who have a tendency for anti-social behaviour and sportswear have always existed. The word chav has not. The only difference is that now we are encouraged to point and them and call them chavs and see them as an example of something bigger. An undeserving poor. 

Chav is a term of abuse. Obviously. We all accept that.

Some argue that the High king position was late Med propaganda on behalf of the O'Neils but why would the term exist in the annals if there was never a high king of all Ireland.

If you really think about it what would constitute the first time a united Ireland came into being in a political sense. Would an annual meeting of the leaders of each kingdom be enough ?
I can imagine the huge Iron Age festival at Tara being kicked of by a high king speaking on behalf of the Provencal leaders. 

Who's to say Ireland hasn't been united since the Bronze age ?

In my own opinion Ireland became united in 7000BC when the Mesolithic people of the Island abandoned microlithic technology distinguishing them from the rest of Europe for a 1000 year period. 

There is no specific historical document out lining a united Ireland because the ancient Irish didn't need to tell themselves the blatantly obvious.

We've already made great business and basically spent nothing, and even sold Livermore for 8m. Our budget already for the past 3 fucking seasons with -20 mil net spend = Musacchio, Schneiderlin and a QUALITY AML/AMC (chuck 20m at em) with a couple of high potential youngsters like Tielemans, Boetius, Patrick Roberts. Please. Please. We have scouts, this isn't difficult. We have lots of ''so so'' and should be looking to replace that with the best quality we can. What's the point of having Townsend, Chadli, Lennon when we can flip that profit into 1 versatile, actually quality player? Same with having about 6 CM's. 

Basically, I agree with Poch. No point in having ''mediocre'' at so many positions if you can put that cash towards less, but ''better'' and more versatile. I also wish Joe Lewis would give us a little...loan too, seeing as he's a multi billionaire. Absolute worse case? We do have a pretty good academy to bring some players through as backup.

true,Burizard,ske1,,"1. The team looks set for a promising campaign, with an identical starting 11 returning to the pitch for the first time in years. Couple this with the depth added over the summer, and the team looks set to challenge for a similar place in the league and a competitive European campaign. Boasting excellent depth at Wing-back and the center of midfield, the Toffees could struggle with injuries to its front line. However with Roberto Martinez at the helm, the return of Romelu Lukaku, and the added experience of many bright youngsters in the squad CL Qualification seems a possibility. 

2. 

**Leighton Baines**- Having gained worldwide recognition over the past 3 seasons for his stellar play, look for Martinez to seek new ways to utilize his star left back this season. Having already mentioned a similar move to Philip Lahm at Bayern Munich, Martinez could utilize Baines in the center of midfield as the campaign progresses, with fan-favorite Bryan Oviedo(LB) waiting in the ranks behind him.

**Romelu Lukaku**- The strength of the entire squad hinges on this lad's success in his sophmore season with the club. Playing in a position with a clear lack of depth, Lukaku will need to display longevity in addition to his quality. Having looked fatigued for much of last season when playing a number of games in a row, the 21 year old will need to show consistent quality if the Toffees are to shine domestically and in Europe.

**Aiden McGeady**- After joining the side as the sole January signing in 2014, McGeady provided exciting flair in a position desperately in need of depth. With a similar shortage of wingers presenting itself this season, the Irish international will need to link well with his teammates in addition to his fleet footed moves, if the offense is to succeed.

By your definition somebody who was wealthy and educated could wear sports clothes, act in an anti-social behaviour, be young and have no further education but they would not be a chav.

Poverty is essential to the existence of the term. So the term is in part a derogatory term for the poor because its existence suggests that poverty forms one of the bad characteristics needed to qualify as a chav. If this was not the case it would not be a derogatory term or a term of abuse.  

The fact that your definition involves a mix of characteristics explains why I defined it as a caricature of the working class and not just an insult or term of abuse. We have always had poor uneducated anti-social young people who wear sports clothes. It is only now that we have developed a term of abuse for such people which defines them by their class and thus automatically concludes that part of their defect is their class itself.

But my attitude is to have a two-fold approach to political positions; the blue sky long game and the pragmatic immediate future. So for example I might support Scottish independence even though I'm not a statist. That said, the two inform each other. I support separatist/independence movements by default because smaller states are weaker states. ;)

What I'm saying is that you could run for office to try and improve people's lives in the short term, even though it might contravene your long term ideology to support mandatory government, if you feel ethically driven to do so.

I often wonder, though, whether it's better to stand back and let the world become a hellhole so the bathwater gets bad enough that the things people think are babies don't matter. That is, maybe if the world is despotic and corrupt and exploitative enough, people might abandon their attachment to things like the legal protection of private property, etc.

Some opinions are more valuable than others. Consensus isn't always right, but the consensus of experts in a field usually (and I would say increasingly, now that research can be transmitted internationally and instantly) is. As far as hierarchical structures go, if a group of people voluntarily recognise the expertise of someone among their number, I don't have a problem with their having greater influence on issues relating to their field.

The current system can be seen as a second house filled with experienced politicians who are freed from the yoke of elections, and free to use their wisdom to reign in the extravagances of the lower house. Or at least this could be an ambition for the Lords!

Perhaps the current system could be reformed. You could, for example, put a 20 year cap on MPs terms in the commons before they transition to their (max) 20 year term in Lords. Or create a smaller Lords which consists of former cabinet ministers who meet less frequently to vote on major issues, kind of like a corporate non-exec board.

Either way the current system of life-time spots for ex-MPs, bishops, aristocrats, and people who donated a lot of money to the right person seems daft.

Tax cuts for exporters and those who create jobs here while selling overseas. Entice big global firms to come here and employ lots of people. 
NOT give blanket ridiculous tax cuts for the corporations that take all the money from the people in N.I. We should raise their taxes.

* disposable income 

Raise the minimum wage already. BAN Agencies taking a cut from workers pay (""temp"" for 4years+ ... you're taking the piss and a cut of the wages).  

* public expenditure

eg...Would be far less working tax credits if people were paid a decent wage. 

* % public sector employment

Implying it's a race to get the least public sector jobs. Funding the jobs is important.

  
  

The most annoying stat is the GVA. It makes us look ""lazy"". Reality is that if wages were higher...demand would be greater.  ""Production"" and ""income"" in overall business sectors would increase.  FFS, England has the ""best"" GVA and it imports more than exports. They have the extra disposable income to deal with it though.

They have such a gross connotation and adaptation of Islam, that it's frightening. These fighters are more or less prepared to die and kill anyone for their twisted ideals, so much so that I don't think taking their weapons away won't be enough. I'm sure they'll find one way or another to fight for their cause. 

I think this problem needs to be tackled a bit differently and the old fashioned way of bombing them or fighting them head on may actually make it worse. The group's growth needs to be controlled and reduced significantly and educating their followers on the true atrocities of ISIS. So limiting them in their usage of social media, i.e. Facebook, Twitter, etc (which is an extremely effective way they use to recruit and brainwash young people) and also using media in some way to steer the general public away from the group. This will probably be extremely difficult and also quite controversial, but also necessary imo. 

Unlike the civil wars in Africa, where children joined wars because they had nothing else to do and wanted to make some money, the ISIS fighters have a twisted cause they are willing to die for, so I doubt they'll get bored and lose excitement.

true,SouthPads,cnty-england,England,"GET READY FOR SOME HISTORY YO:

In 1945, Jews settle 20,770 km² area inhabited by a population only twice the size of modern day Bradford, called the (British) Palestinian Mandate.

Since the establishment of the mandate in 1920, Arabs had been deeply unhappy with British rule. The Arabs had been promised a new homeland in return for fighting against the Ottoman Turks in the first world war, but had not yet received it because 'muh colonies. by 1945 this resentment deepened with the mass immigration of Jews as a result of a UN resettlement resolution, resulting in cultural cleansing of previously Arab areas. Britain abstained from the vote, wanting to stay impartial. Britain felt very sorry for what had happened to the Jews, but also felt loyalty to the Arabs. Also, we loved having colonies.

By 1947, a Jewish terrorist organisation called the '*Irgun*' had reached prominance, and had been exiling and murdering indigenous Arab families and settling their land. This campaign culminated in the bombing of the King David Hotel (British HQ).

It is however important to remember that the Irgun was **CONDEMNED** both by the Jewish establishment internationally and also by the Jewish League of Israel. However, it did have large minority support.

In 1948, post-war Britain had begun its policy of de-colonisation which was due to in equal parts us deciding to not continue an extremely questionable and often very exploitative practice, and also Britain just not being up to it any more. So in 1948, Britain left Palestine looking like [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine#mediaviewer/File:UN_Partition_Plan_For_Palestine_1947.svg)

Almost IMMEDIATELY after the end of the mandate (and a confusing set of small wars and power struggles in Palestine) the Arab-Israeli war of 1948 began, whereby a coalition of Arab nations and Palestinian 'freedom fighters' launched an attack on Israel. Despite the bitter devastation of the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem, Israeli won. the 1949 armistice agreements were then signed, giving the Jews 78% of former mandatory Palestine (an increase of about 33%) making Israel look like [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#mediaviewer/File:1947-UN-Partition-Plan-1949-Armistice-Comparison.svg)

A buffer zone was created between Israel and Egypt (the main, and best (soviet) equipped Arab state involved in the 1948 war) and maintained by the UN.

Then, in 1956 a chap named 'Gamal Abdel Nasser' was the democratically elected the president of Egypt. Nasser was a populist, a socialist, a secularist, and a pan-arabist. He introduced wide sweeping social reforms and modernisations and was wildly popular, even in Saudi-Arabia, which was a traditional enemy of Egypt!

In 1965 (I think) Nasser began to put his plans into action and organise a massive military incursion into Israel, to 'exterminate' the Jews, and 'annihilate Israel'. He got everyone on board, the Jordanians, the Saudis, the Syrians, the Iraqis and also a shit load of fighters from other Arab states like Algeria. Their aim was to establish a new [*Caliphate*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Caliphate) for Arabs across the middle-east and north Africa.

In June 1967, Nasser ordered the UN commander of the buffer zone to leave or be killed, and so he did. In honesty, we can't blame him. The combined forces of the Arab coalition were staggering, well over 500,000 men, as well as MiG-21s and about 2,500 soviet made tanks. They massed them on the border of Israel, ready for attack.

Israel knew it was about to be destroyed, and so attacked in a brilliant series of devastating pre-emptive suprise attacks, smashing the arab armies to pieces, and occupying the entirety of Palestine afterwards, and also the extremly valuable sinai peninsula.

Nasser died a few years after. People would later say he died of a broken heart. (or maybe because he lost in such an embarrassing way lolllll).

in 1973, the Arabs were at it again (Yes this is the third invasion, Israel are right not to trust the Arab coalition!) and invaded Israeli land. Long story short, Israel won, a peace deal was struck, and Israel gave Egypt the Sinai peninsula as a gesture of good faith and to also grease the wheels of a permanent and lasting peace of the Israel-Neighbouring states.

So today we have an occupied Palestine. A Palestine that vows the extermination of all Jews in Israel, that repeatedly attempts to murder and maim Israelis. Who's one-time *Nobel Prize Winning Leader* Yasser Arafat deliberately undermined peace efforts, despite the COMPLETE REMOVAL OF ALL SETTLEMENTS from Gaza.

And on the other side we have Israel. A Massively reactionary, frankly racist, colonial state, who is the way it is because of the repeated attacks on its right to exist. For this reason, despite MASSIVE civilian casualties in Gaza, they continue to airstrike. Because they are scared. Maybe rightly so.

Who can say? Not me.

I'm doing an open honours degree with the OU currently, and I'm finding it pretty awesome. The work load is decent enough so you don't feel like you're doing too little or being overloaded. The cost isn't as extreme as a brick uni, and I'm not tied down to a certain subject most of the time. If I wanted to do one year of my degree and then stop for a year, I can do that. If I want to do a module on Chinese and then a module in Astrophysics, I can also do that.

If there is one piece of advice I could give is that I sometimes find it tricky not to fall out of a schedule and procrastinate on my work. Not having set 'physical' lectures and all the learning requires you to be more determined in my opinion, especially as the only person pushing you to study is you.

From being a teenage doss in my sixth form years to having to manage all my studies and my work like an adult has changed me for the better, too.

10th Doctor: I’m the Doctor. I’m a Time Lord. I’m from the planet Gallifrey in the constellation of Kasterborous. I’m 903 years old, and I’m the man who’s gonna save your lives and all six billion people on the planet below. You got a problem with that?

That's of course gonna change if we acquire some help, especially if the Valdes rumours are true because Joel sucks.

2. The 3 players you should look for are **McGeady**, **Besic** and **Gibson**.


**McGeady**

In way better shape than last season and his dribbling is still top notch. His end product still has a lot of room for improvement (especially when he's on his left foot) but he's an out and out winger who can beat a defender one on one 95% of the time. The challenging thing is how to fit him and Mirallas in throughout the season.


**Besic**

Already a fan favorite with his aggressive tackling and attitude, Besic does need to cut down on the fouls. He committed 5 fouls in the first 15 minutes against Paderborn last night. Refs are gonna look for you and it's not a reputation that you wanna have. While he does offer silky skills and good range of passing, his heading needs some improvement especially if he's playing at the base of the midfield. Potential problem if he's partnered with McCarthy when they both aren't the tallest guys in the world.


**Gibson**

With him being injured so much last year, it's hard to remember the value Gibbo offers. He looked good in the preseason, spraying the ball around and looking comfortable. If he can stay away from the physio's table, he will certain add something different to the midfield of the Blues, namely his long shots ability.

true,johnmedgla,null,null,"Tongue in cheek overview I wrote last week:

For whatever reason, Britain breaks apart, and mad Romans who scattered to the wind two thousand years ago suddenly return with a vengeance and set up a state stretching from Cornwall to Kent. The UN steps in with a plan to split the land.


We decide to fight them rather than agreeing to any partition. In fact, we could probably round up an overwhelming mob of angry people from all across the British Isles and the rest of Europe to drive them out. Of course, we're mirroring history here, so we lose. Badly. Our angry mob which outnumbered the Romans and marched with the stated intention to ""drive them into the sea"" was crushed, utterly, so perhaps we should have taken the UN partition plan before the war started, but hey - hindsight.


In any event, our grand European coalition is soundly defeated, the Romans are busy building farms and cities all over the land they just won, and our people are now jammed into what amounts to two reservations in Birmingham and Plymouth, but - and this is important - one run and indeed owned by Scotland (which swallowed up Northumbria and the Midlands in the chaos), the other by Wales.
What's our next move? Our initial understandable reaction to the Roman invasion was to reject the UN partition utterly and fight for the whole thing, but now we lost. Are we going to attempt to negotiate to get something like the original UN partition plan?


Of course not, that wouldn't be fair, pragmatism be damned. We're going to spend the next twenty years sending raiding parties against the Romans and establishing a militarised state-within-a-state in Wales in which we try to collect our own taxes, run our own mini army and set up our own 'law-enforcement' system completely separate from the Welsh state. This will alarm the Welsh, as you might expect. Moreover, we're launching raids from Wales and Scotland against the Romans, and when they retaliate we run away and leave the Scottish and Welsh armies to fight the battles. They really don't like this, and start protesting.


But it's okay, after twenty years of categorically and absolutely refusing any sort of diplomatic engagement with the Romans, we will finally convince the Old Gang to get back together for ""Operation Drive The Romans Into The Sea, Round II, Electric Boogaloo."" At first, the overwhelming alliance we're able to put together will score major advances against the Romans and people will start talking about the Final and Utter Destruction of Rome, but by the third day our ""Just all attack them from every direction at once"" war plan will start to be countered as the Romans engage the (separately operating) national armies one by one and destroy them in detail.


By the fourth day, our armies will be in full retreat and the Romans will occupy the reservations in which our people live. By the fifth day, they've captured significant parts of Wales, all of the Midlands and Northumbria, and random other places (such as Normandy and let's say Cork) from our Grand Alliance.


On the Sixth day, the Roman artillery comes in range of Edinburgh, Cardiff and Dublin in the space of two hours, and our coalition surrenders. Worse, we've lost more land.


We are not happy about this, as you might expect - and we definitely still aren't talking to the Romans - but neither are our allies. We spend three years binding our wounds, and then decide to try something new. Remember the militia we formed in Wales? We decide the best plan is to use that force to attempt to take over Wales entirely - after all, we have nothing else to lose, right?


Long story short - we lose. We get kicked out of Wales, so the population of our reservations increase by a full 50%, Wales itself refuses to talk to us any more, the Scots are looking at us funny, and the rest of our allies are starting to get pretty tired of our shit. Oh, the rest of the world is also distinctly unimpressed since immediately after trying and failing to take over Wales we decided what would really help our cause was blowing random things up around the world, hijacking lots of aeroplanes, and murdering the Roman team at the Olympics.


But wait - there's more. While the transfer of refugees from Wales to our occupied territory was huge, even more of them decided to set up shop in Ireland to continue the struggle in a new theatre. It's going to take them some time to get set up though, so forget them for now.


It is a bad time. The Romans are stronger than ever, our old Allies are a lot less friendly since our misadventure in Wales, and conditions in our reservations haven't materially improved in almost thirty years because we explicitly and categorically refuse to talk to the Romans - the land is OURS dammit, and that principle is more important than any other consideration. Meanwhile, the Romans have started building whole new towns on land they captured on our side of the UN Partition plan. Despite the fact we rejected that plan utterly (remember, that's how the actual war started), which we remind the world daily, we still insist that the Romans building on our side of those borders which we'll never recognise is an intolerable provocation. Also a war crime! Of course, in order to actually leverage that, we have to notionally accept those borders after all, hmm, that requires further consideration, so let's put it on the back burner for now.


Of course, our old Allies may not like us any more but they still don't like the Romans, who have captured land from each of them. So, it's time for the gang to get together for one last hurrah - ""Operation Drive The Romans Into The Sea, Round III, The Final Solution"". We'll coordinate more closely this time, and launch a surprise attack on the holiest day of their calendar.


Guess what happened next? I know, I know, I hate to repeat myself. The Romans swatted us. Again. Oy with the suffering of our people. This time, our allies actually talk to the Romans afterwards, and get pretty much all their territory back in exchange for peace agreements, and agriculturally worthless inhospitable tracts on the borders which act as a defensive bulwark against future aggression. If it isn't bad enough that our former friends have effectively abandoned us with this peace, there's one more stipulation that really sticks in the craw. Wales and Scotland get back essentially everything, except the reservations our people live in which they specifically insist they do not under any circumstances want back.


Abandoned, bereft, now with really nothing to lose, we're going to try (at last) to talk to the Romans. Amazingly, they aren't particularly happy to hear from us, but then we remember we forgot to tell our militia to stop raiding their towns. Worryingly, a significant number of those militias tell us where to shove it when we ask them to stop for a while so we can have proper negotiations, apparently they've lost faith in our ability to lead our people either to peace or to victory.


Everything is falling apart at the seams now, so it's time for our final gambit. The militia that went to Ireland after being expelled from Wales? They're going to try and take over Ireland now - at last, a home for our people! Apparently, we don't do irony, but I digress. We lose. Again. Even more people are expelled from Ireland and come streaming into our creaking reservations.


Okay. Now we really do have nothing left to lose. The Romans refuse to talk to us unless we can get our various militias to stop attacking them (and latterly sending suicide bombers), and our militias refuse to stop firing at all. We may have oversold the 'Drive the Romans Into The Sea' propaganda - despite having it run on our official TV channel for the last thirty years alongside programs exhorting our children to believe murdering Romans is the most noble thing they can aspire to, surely everyone understands that was just rhetoric and hyperbole - just the way the game is played? You mean a significant number of people actually swallowed it whole and are now essentially fanatics? Well fuck.


This brings us almost up to the present day. The more extreme militias keep fighting the good fight, launching futile attacks at the Romans with raids and rockets. This earns them prestige, since at least they're doing something. The Romans have a wacky system of government in which the leaders cannot simply ignore these attacks or the population will depose them, so they periodically retaliate. Unfortunately the geography and demographics of the land mean lots of innocent people die when they do so, but this doesn't dissuade either side.


The Romans refuse to have good faith negotiations with us about anything, be it easing their blockade of our reservations so we can bring in more supplies (or weapons, as they fear), dismantling their illegal settlements, or a fully comprehensive peace plan - unless we can stop our crazies attacking them.


The crazies, in turn, either refuse to stop attacking the Romans until they do everything we want, or refuse to stop attacking them outright as a matter of principle. Worse, the crazies are gaining influence year on year as our people's faith in our own leadership continues to decline.
So we're stuck. They won't stop doing the things we don't like until we stop doing the things they don't like. The only real change in a generation has been their unilateral disengagement from Plymouth a decade ago, but the crazies moved in within a week to take advantage of the better launch sites for their rockets. This has discouraged the Romans from making further concessions or first moves.


Periodically, we get together for talks, and multiple times in the last twenty years we've come this close to a workable solution, but every time we try our crazies intensify their attacks (NO SURRENDER!), and the Roman crazies (they have lots too, after fighting for this long) are able to whip up enough hysteria that the whole thing breaks down.

Kicking off this list is the 1956 FA Cup, which very few people in the world would consider to be an ""iconic"" moment in world football history.

But take a look at the man on the far right—Manchester City goalkeeper Bert Trautmann—who injured his neck with around 15 minutes remaining in the match.

He play the remaining 15 minutes in excruciating pain and found out three days later that he had indeed broken a bone in his neck and dislocated five vertebrae.


This photo, therefore, becomes an iconic imagine about the sheer grit and toughness that we only wished footballers had in the game today.

Sure they might get away with it this season if ws get in Europe. But what happened in poland, we we're beaten fairly before they put the ineligible lad on. We can say they cheated, but thier cheating had little to no impact on the final result, if we're honest. If we get in and fluke a result; british giants celtic cant be written off. Despite not having many champions leauge standard players. If we loose and crash out like last time. Scottish champions celtic are there to make up the numbers. Which we really are, we can point to a win against barcalona and scraping through to the last 16, but since then our squads deteriorated further.

true,ultrasupergenius,flair8,,"&gt;Fourth is always realistic.

A fourth place finish for Spurs will take not only an epic season from Spurs, but an epic cock-up by multiple other teams in the top of the table.

* Man City 
* Liverpool
* Chelsea 
* Arses
* Man United
* Everton

In order to have a top 4 finish, we need place better than AT LEAST 3 of those clubs, all of which show promising signs of being in good or great form this year.  

* Liverpool lost Suarez, but have been making some strong acquisitions and strengthening their squad - which was already spoiled for choice for striking options.

* Man United have shown signs of former glory in pre-season, and Van Gaal seems well placed to motivate that team towards greatness.

* Chelsea are Chelsea.  They have an expensive squad that is not likely to falter.

* The Woolwich side have re-assembled a set of twats that are unfortunately capable of fourth even without Theo, who is gearing up for a return.

* Everton are solid contenders at the top end of the table - and I can't see writing them off entirely. 

* Man City has bought there way into the top, and financial fair play rules just don't seem to apply to them.  Even still, money has bought them a strong squad capable of a similiar season to the last couple.

So which three of that group of six do you think it is always realistic that we will be above in the table?

As /u/Theskian said, we were a bit short on ideas going forward at times, relying too much on long balls to Pellè. Gaston looked hungry which was great to see.

Leverkusen just went to ground whenever we got momentum, really frustrating and needless in a friendly. There must have been 10mins of stoppage yet the ref only gave 3mins at the end of the match.

Sorry to be negative but based on the overall performance and the players we have at our disposal, I think we have absolutely no chance against Liverpool next Sunday.

So, away at West Ham; pokey ground; physical game.  Big Sam's team will work hard to keep men behind the ball.  First game of the season.  I don't think Poch will take too many ""risks"".

true,Arisutea,null,null,"Third party fire &amp;amp; theft is not always cheapest. So worth checking out fully comp.

If you can keep your mileage low (like below 5 or 6k) it becomes much cheaper.

What excess have you put on? Increasing it to 5-600 quid can help a lot. Might be half the value of the car, but the way I looked at it, if it cost less than my excess to fix (or close to it), I just pay for it myself. If it cost much more, then I've probably royally screwed up and written off the car.

Adding your mum or dad as a named driver to your own policy (not you adding to theirs), can lower it a lot. If you claim it doesn't affect their no claims (because it is your policy not theirs).

Lower insurance group doesn't always mean cheaper insurance. Why not? Well, insurance is basically a bet based on how statistically likely are you to crash given your age, car, driving experience etc. you can't change how old you are or how much experience you have, but you can choose what you drive. New drivers typically have small engined hatchbacks and then crash them! So by driving something which isn't a shitty tiny engined hatchback you can't be tarred with the ""he's young and going to crash his 1ltr shitbox"" brush. Have a look at things like a 1.6 ford focus, bit bigger car, less likely to be drive by a younger driver, less stats to say you will crash it... Make sense? My first car at 21 was a 2litre ford focus st170, cost me less than 900 my first year. I had friends who paid more for fiestas, clios etc.

Firstly, when did you pass your driving test? even if it is a few months ago, it can bring down your insurance if you tell them you've passed for a few months (it helped with me).

I found that 5 door cars were cheaper to insure than 3 door cars of the same model (a 5 door Hyundai i20 will be cheaper to insure than a 3 door Hyundai i20)

Dont go for a car with a engine over 1.4-ish (they are expensive to tax and insure)

Vans are cheap to insure, you could get something like a Ford Fiesta van (its pretty much the car, but with no rear seats)

When you are spending a fair bit on a car, get a good/reliable car that will last. I'd go for a car between 5 and 10 years old (my first car was 5 years old).

DO NOT front your insurance. Fronting is where your car is insured for someone else as the main driver and you as the listed driver, whereas in fact, you are the main driver.

Add your family as named drivers (who have no points on their licence, have driven for more than 5 years and live at the same address)

true,ShanghaiNoon,null,null,"The premise of your post is wrong because when Jewish refugees flooded into Palestine it wasn't an independent state, it was a colony of the United Kingdom. Unless you start the comparison with the British Isles being a colony of a global superpower like the US or China and already has a mixed population of (minority) Romans and (majority) Brits it's not the same. 

A better comparison would be if gypsies fled to the British Raj due to systematic persecution in Europe and elsewhere and then Britain under pressure from gypsy terrorist groups conducting attacks against British posts in order to carve out their own state decide to hastily withdraw and draw up and partition the land creating a state for gypsies in India. 

Indians are upset at this unexpected partition of their country which has been rejected by other countries in the region but supported by colonial powers and decide to try and re-annex the territory. They fail and now the Gypsy state has expanded and annexed huge swathes of India and expelled Indians from the Gypsy state meaning Indians have been squeezed into smaller tracts of land. 

The Gypsy state receives billions of dollars in high tech weaponry and strong support from western powers and gypsies abroad. The US now provides billions of dollars in aid to other countries in the region if they accept peace with the new Gypsy state and co-operate with them. The entire policy of the United States in Asia now revolves around the interests of the Gypsy state. Meanwhile, India has now been separated into two territories, [1] a strip of land bordering Burma which has been beseiged and blockaded by both countries resulting in a humanitarian crisis and [2] a larger tract of land to the west which the Gypsy state is now occupying and where most Indians live. 

The Gypsy state is now a nuclear state much larger than it originally was (and India much smaller) and around 80% of the population is Gypsy and 20% Indian. It is in effective control of almost all of India now and is expanding to now occupy the nicer parts of what is left of India. It can carry out airstrikes and bombardments of India on demand on suspected targets and has carried out several large bombing campaigns against the small tract of India left near Burma. 

The Gypsy state now demands that for there to be peace in the region India must now recognise the Gypsy state as being not only a legitimate state but also that it is a homeland for gypsies and a Gypsy state for gypsies rather than Indians. Also, using its American ally it ensures an Indian state is prevented from being created and demands that one can only exist if it is completely demilitarised. 

I can see why Indians under this scenario would be pissed off. They're left with two tracts of land, one which is a tiny tract of territory which is besieged, borders Burma (which is a military dictatorship paid off to support Israel) and regularly bombed into oblivion every few years. The other is completely under gypsy occupation and is shrinking by the day as the Gypsy state expands its territory further into it. Indians in this territory are arrested *en masse* and subject to regular military checkpoints and religious extremist gypsies who live in the colonial settlements there live by a completely different system where they are free to carry rifles and intimidate Indians and dispossess them of their land.",1,1407663721,null,0,false,0,cjm3zir,t3_2d2s2g,t1_cjm3zir,t1_cjlzkpb,null,1435164694,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1
true,Change_you_can_xerox,null,null,"Hamas won the 2006 legislative election in large part due to widespread dissatisfaction with Fatah, who had been the only real representation the Palestinians had had politically. Hamas won partially by moderating it's rhetoric and taking domestic politics seriously. So, they promised large-scale welfare programs, increase in quality of life, as well as a more hardline stance against Israel. For many people, the failure of the Oslo peace process or just the failure of any peace process in general suggested that Fatah's policy wasn't working. Not that Hamas' is now, but it might not have been so obvious 8 years ago. You know how elections get even in developed countries - people get sick of parties being in power for too long. Imagine that, but also your houses are destroyed every few years by an occupying power.

There was also an element of ""fuck you"" to outside pressure in the election of Hamas. Fatah was seen very much as the party favoured by the US and Israel, and many Palestinians felt this was because they were weak, corrupt and would cave into pressure at the drop of a hat. One of Hamas' election slogans was something along the lines of ""The US and Israel don't want you to vote Hamas - what do YOU say?"" Again, you can sort of understand the dynamic - people get driven to UKIP in this country as a protest vote over laws regulating the shape of fruits. What if the EU was supplying arms to an occupying power in the UK and actively supporting one political party in a legislative election? 

So it's slightly more complicated than ""Palestinians love terrorists"". ",0,1407663723,null,0,1407667031,0,cjm3zjd,t3_2d2s2g,t1_cjm3zjd,t1_cjlvcki,null,1435164694,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4
true,hjb345,null,null,"Stick your mum and dad on as named drivers. All they ask for is how long the license has been held for, and if they have had an accident in the past 5 years - I added my sister to mine, who has had a license longer than me but only got a car recently, and it took a few hundred quid off. If you're in Manchester, the Admiral group, Admiral, Elephant, Bell and Diamond, are by far and away the cheapest. 

Also, use different price comparison sites. I've found money supermarket consistently gives me prices cheaper than confused, where as the meerkats often quote me a couple hundred more. Limit your mileage, not everyone does 10-12k a year. If you do go over, you can always ring them later on and bump it up, so you're only paying for a few months of higher mileage. 

Go fully comp. It might be £100-200 more, but if your car gets written off as your fault, you're down £1000 having to buy a new car. 

If you're really struggling and don't mind breaking the law in the name of cheaper car insurance, start typing family and friends addresses in. A mate of mine lives 10 minutes down the road and pays about 40% more for his insurance. But if you get found out shit can go downhill fast, it's your decision. 

Insurance seems to have cracked down on fronting too, where you put a parent as the named driver and yourself named. The prices seem to be the same no matter who's on the policy of someone under 25 is on it. 

I'd think twice about the black box and having them spy on your driving. Dog runs into the road? Emergency stop. Erratic driving. Don't judge a corner quite right and take it faster than the box thinks is safe? (hey, as a new driver the odd mistake will happen) black mark, erratic driving. Leave it parked somewhere the box doesn't like? Black mark.. 

A lot of them also don't let you drive at night, which is a fantastic idea when you need to work 2 jobs to pay the fucking thing... 

Have a play with where it's parked overnight as well- in my experience saying it was in a garage put it up 200 quid, because the insurers usually had to pay for a damaged garage when the car got stolen. 

The car you are choosing also is a massive factor. Forget insurance groups, think insurance risks. How many people my age own this car and have crashed it? Corsas /clios and the like are very popular 1st cars, and they know it and price accordingly. Think outside the box a bit, I think Lancaster do classic insurance for 17 year olds but you don't earn NCB on classic policies. If you want a modern car, put different specs in and model years, it can change quite a bit. I found that a range rover was cheaper to insure than a ford focus of the same age for me, even though in a straight line at least the range rover is a tad quicker. And can do more damage! 

It all comes down to a bit of a lottery really, some tips will work for you, some won't. You just have to mess around with 3 or 4 comparison sites, and the select few that aren't on there. Don't be afraid of haggling either, these guys want your money no matter how much it is. Best of luck!

For the simple reason that ""the rules"" aren't always in line with ""appropriate driving"".

For example, overtake someone on the motorway and peak at 80? Your telematics box says you were speeding. You were, but seriously, who cares?

Some policies will *automatically* cancel your policy if you break any rules 3 times. 

The price is often not significantly lower than a regular policy where you are not penalised for what is actually normal driving.

They log acceleration and braking - they decide what they consider too much acceleration or braking - paying no regard to driving conditions at the time or what is actually going on in reality.

And you had better hope you never have an accident, because you can bet that they will use all your telematics data to weasel out of paying out for the claim. Can you be *certain* that your driving will *always* be *perfect* (read: by their rules)? If not, stay the hell away.

true,theyeatthepoo,null,null,"Hey. 

You may have a different definition of 'chav' to the definition of the man I was having a discussion with. His definition included the fact that a chav has to be poor and have no education. In contrast you make it sound like the word chav means the same as the word thug, criminal or just somebody who is a cunt. 

I cunt is a cunt and I have no problem with calling a cunt a cunt. It's a word that describe's behaviour and has no connection to socio-economic background, gender etc. It stands alongside other words that describe genitalia of both sexes as being a term of abuse.  But the word chav, as defined by the man I was talking to, is not just a word for...

&gt;aggressive little cunts who add nothing to society and do so in public

It is a term of abuse for the poor. 

But to answer your question:

&gt; If you've been yelled at, abused, threatened, mugged, or attacked by someone in a tracksuit who hangs around in the park all day, are you really going to tell me that person isn't a chav? Or that chav isn't a perfectly acceptable term to use for people like that?

I think the word cunt is a perfectly suitable term for a person like that. Why do I need to bring their class into it? I've known people from middle class family's with a good education to act like that.

 The people you describe don't act like that because they come from a low income, since most low income people do not act like that. So its just not accurate and is unneeded.

The very cheapest option is to stay at a campsite: in most cases this will be about £10/night.

The next cheapest would be a youth hostel: the YHA has a large number of very reasonable places, often in lovely and remote locations.

For a bit more money (at least £100/person per week) you can rent a self-catering holiday cottage - the two best organisations are the National Trust, and my favourite, the Landmark Trust - who have some stunning and unique properties.

Most of the best places are not in towns, but in small country villages or isolated locations.

Sorry I haven't provided links but I'm posting on my phone.

My personal recommendations-

Camping: Great Langdale campsite (operated by the National Trust, in the Lake District); Tom's Field (private campsite, Purbeck in Dorset).

Hostels:Black Sail Hut in the Lake District.

Cottages: National Trust place in Beddgelert, North Wales,  and The Pigsty (Landmark Trust) Robin Hood's Bay.

In the Lake District, wild camping is tolerated on the high fells, as long as you are quiet, move on in the morning and camp above the highest enclosure walls.

Taider (which is pronounced Tie-ee-der as I found out at the game) looks a very useful signing. Great stamina miixed with aggression, agility, he made a lot of runs into the box. 

Tadic definitely has the flicks and flair of a talisman but he got caught in possession quite often. His one-touch passes are great but he needs to be quicker when over the ball. Still needs to adjust to the upgrade in leagues. 

Pelle didnt win as many headers as i would have liked, but thats mainly because Omar Toprak is an absolute beast. Those two had a real battle. Also, Pelle seemed to only get long balls put into him, which got a bit frustrating. 

Bertrand is like a mirror-image of Clyne; will always go forward but is strong at tracking back to win the ball. Also had to play CB for the times where Yoshida found himself out of position. We're definitely in trouble if we start with Yoshida. 

Gaston showing the same promise as always; hunger, excellent ball-control, but couldnt find an end product if it was handed to him on a birthday cake. 

Mayuka had one moment where he left their RB on his arse, gets in the box and then just completely forgets how to football, hesitates and passes the ball to their defender.

There's no point paying bargain basement prices to someone with a reputation for leaving people high and dry when they make a claim. Also if you find a quote from e.g. Admiral that's undercut elsewhere it gives you more room to negotiate the premium down over the phone.

Consider taking the Pass Plus course if you haven't already. At 21 it may take some money off your premium. Adding a parent onto your policy as a second driver may help too.

Third-party fire and theft isn't necessarily cheaper than fully comp. Keep your options open.

I've now made slight alterations to the side that would allow for any striker alongside Rooney. I'm convinced I will purchase Aguero as soon as I see he's fully fit and cementing a starting berth. Thus my decision to make is between Sturridge/Dzeko/Sturridge (at least to start with). Given Dzeko's rich vein of form at the end of last season and the fact Negredo is out I think he will most likely be my selectionl

I do have a couple of follow up questions:

- Would you think that Yaya, at 31, can have a similar season to last year? He had never previously scored close to the number of goals as he did last season and part of this I imagine is down to him having taken a significant number of FKs and Penalties. Once Aguero is back in the side, will this still be the case? Do you also think Pellegrini's style of play specifically suits Yaya's attacking side?

The creation of Jordan isn't anywhere near as contentious because it wasn't created based on Arab migration to Jordan nor is it a homeland for a particular ethnic group. To put it simply, it doesn't result in population transfers which Israel does as it seeks to subsidise the settlement of Jews internationally in Israel.

Also you're making it sound like 1948 Arab-Israeli war was a case of Israeli troops being massively outnumbered and outgunned. It's clearly not the case, there were almost 120,000 Israeli troops who were facing around 60,000 Arab troops. In short, Israeli troops outnumbered Arab troops 2:1. It clearly wasn't the entire Arab world as you've suggested, if so they'd have committed far more than 60k troops between them.

Also in that war Israel had already gained sophisticated military weaponry from the West including several B-17 bombers from the West and heavy artillery and mortars from European states. Take that into account and your narrative changes significantly.

The last two paragraphs are not really relevant here, you seem to be now glossing over the fundamental point here which is the morality and justification of the creation of Israel specifically within the British Mandate of Palestine. You've now resorted to generic criticisms of Palestinian action in response to this rather than actually aiming to justify Israel's creation itself which was created by continual terrorist attacks against British forces in Palestine.

true,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,"I think 5th will be an extremely good result for a new manager with a still fairly new squad and a very different philosophy to what we've played previously.

I think Everton will struggle to match the performance level of last year... they played pretty much at capacity last season.  Liverpool won't be as destructive without Suarez, but they'll still likely finish above us.  And it's hard to imagine Utd having as bad a season as they did last year by any stretch of the imagination.

Finishing 6th is probably likely, so 5th would take a mammoth effort.

I hope we take Europa seriously, but there's no way we're winning it.  We don't have the mental strength or ruthlessness yet, and although we can build both of those things by the time it gets to the pointy end of the comp, there are better, Cup-experienced sides in the comp, let alone the 3rd placed UCL teams that will drop down and no doubt be extremely competitive.

Europa is a lottery for so many reasons... a bad pitch, ref, freak goal or spate of injuries can quickly knock you out of the whole thing.  Leagues reward consistency... Cups require far more luck.

Never realised just how bonkers the Scottish monetary system is. Here's something from a (self declared) Scot [on the Grauniad site](http://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,5753,-19878,00.html): 

""In fact Scottish notes are not legal tender anywhere - even in Scotland. In other words, you can't insist that they be accepted for payment. As has been mentioned, only coins satisfy this requirement (and even then only up to a limit - 20p for bronze). Scottish notes are essentially cheques made out to cash and drawn on the current accounts of the issuing bank. Firstly this means that they are only worth anything if you trust the bank concerned not to default. Secondly it means that the bank has to have sufficient funds to cover the issue - the Scottish banks have to hold an exactly equal quantity of English notes to cover their own issue. Otherwise there would be serious problems with inflation. So the Scottish economy works on trust - we assume that the banks will not default on their notes. So far we've got away with it, but I'm not sure how much I'd trust the ECB!""",0,1407668301,null,0,false,0,cjm4r1j,t3_2d3vqe,t1_cjm4r1j,t1_cjm0lnp,null,1435165055,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

I do think regret is the wrong word, when people do say ""God look what I was wearing"" in my opinion, it is more a statement from that person as ""Jesus, look at the style at the time"" When we are wearing the current fashion trends and dressing in a genre then we are more than likely at our happiest, fitting in.

A significant part of the personal causes of obesity is tied up in self-esteem, more so than things like smoking and drinking I would say, and I think that makes it harder to tackle. You're not just telling someone to stop eating so much, you're criticising a very personal part of them, and people don't tend to react well to that. A TV campaign is easy to ignore, as well - you can change the channel, turn it off, or tell yourself it doesn't apply to you... ""yeah I'm fat, but I'm not that fat"". With something like obesity, I think there's a lot of running from the truth (metaphorically, obviously), and an advert on the telly is pretty easy to run from.

Having said that, the advert that OP linked is pretty good, because it targets the parents. But that sort of advert doesn't really do much to address the people who are already obese as adults.

Any other country isn't really able to do any significant damage. The Middle East can't. They can suicide bomb each other or drive around in vans shooting people. But they can't wage full scale war that would trigger a world war. 

Iran and other annoying countries in the Middle East aren't a REAL problem. If we really wanted to, we can hammer them into nothing in a few weeks. If we really wanted to destroy their nuclear capability and army, we could, and nobody would intervene because it isn't worth it. Same if we wanted to invade some country in the Middle East. They can't fight back much and nobody would be willing to take us on on their behalf. 

Saudi may be the only ones capable of starting a world war-  if they did it through terrorism or economic means. 

Africa can't do anything. Again, it's small scale warlords and dictators. 

So the only real options are a Russian, Chinese or American land grab. Obviously it would have to be big enough for us to give a shit, not like Crimea which isn't really important enough for us to care, other than on principle. Same for small contested islands in Asia. Simply not important enough to start WW3. Taiwan - maybe. But at the end of the day, would the USA really be willing to fight china to defend Taiwan? IMO it is unlikely.

Second year, went on my own, aged 18, it was £1,800 for me as the main driver, them as named. 

Half way through the new I got a new car (Seat Ibiza 1.2 - 08 plate) 

I was the named driver, I had my mum, dad, and older brother on the policy, and I went direct - not through comparison sites. Was £1,200. That was with Elephant. 

Some people to try: Tesco Bank, Co-Op Insurance, and Diamond/Elephant. Diamond may be branded as I woman's insurer but they do cheap deals for young males (they are also owned by the same company as Elephant)

http://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/generation-high-rent-how-the-rental-game-just-moved-up-a-gear-9625451.html

One of the big takeaways I took from that - as well as the flexibility of renting - was the ""rent out somewhere you don't want to live"" point. So whilst you're technically renting, you're getting a really decent house and possibly for free, by virtue of owning a property or two in somewhere you wouldn't be seen dead in (their example was Liverpool ;-) ). Thus:

&gt; However long they stared at the “help to buy” numbers, a pad in London was never going to be affordable. But Liverpool? You could buy up an entire block of student flats there for the price of a maisonette in the capital. And that’s what a growing breed of renting landlord is doing. They’ve bought up properties in cheaper parts of the country, mostly near popular universities, and use the rents they pocket from students to pay both the mortgage and half their own rent in a Battersea mansion block. “You buy somewhere you don’t want to live, and rent somewhere cooler than you’d ever be able to afford otherwise in London,” says one forty-something doing just that. “It’s the fun of renting without the stress of wondering if you’re going to be a destitute pensioner.”

The only question I'd have about that is how you manage the properties - would you do all the inspection, vetting, repairs etc. yourself or do you employ some sort of maintenance company to do all the hard work and if so how does it affect the money side of things?",0,1407671235,null,0,false,0,cjm59bw,t3_2d2ouh,t1_cjm59bw,t3_2d2ouh,null,1435165302,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

You could also just be a steward, they earn about 35k a year depending on the company which is near the bottom of the ladder in terms of offshore pay but it's not bad.

Getting a job requires finding the job you want then sending out C.V.s to companies on a weekly basis (as in, send each company a C.V. every week) and just keep calling them a few days after you send the C.V. to ask them if they got it and if there are any positions.

But Israel is doing this because if they don't then Hamas will import massive amounts of weapons with which to attack Israel. I think that's the issue: The two sides are caught in a catch-22 where neither want to be the first to take steps to de-escalate because whichever is first to do so is the side that will sustain the damage. The Israelis don't want to do it because the experience of the holocaust sent 'Survival of the Jewish people' straight to the list of all priorities forever, and the Palestinians don't want it because they believe Israel (for that same motivation) want to destroy Palestine.

true,lgf92,null,null,"More info on the tax bands for you (this is off the top of my head, so forgive me if there are slight errors)

First £10,000 of income is not subject to tax (unless you earn over £100,000 p/a). 

The next £32,000 are taxed at the base rate of 20% (plus National Insurance contributions). So if you earn £42,000, you will pay no tax on the £10,000 and 20% tax on the £32,000.

Above that, anything up to £150,000 is taxed at 40%. 

So let's say you earn £21,000 in a year, which is the national average. Your first £10k is tax exempt. You pay 20% tax on £11,000 (£2,200 p/a). That's your income tax sorted, leaving you with £18,800 minus income tax.

However, you are also charged 12% National Insurance (which pays for state healthcare and benefits) if you earn between £153 and £805 a week, which you would be on that salary. So you get £152 a week for free, and the rest is taxed at 12%. That means you'd have £250 a week eligible for NICs, meaning you'd also pay an additional tax of £30 a week (ish), a deduction of £1,565 in a year.

So a £21,000 salary = £17,235 after tax.

Also, it will come down to if we can get the last few signings we need to shore up our defensive deficiencies. I strongly believe we have enough depth in attack to carry out the manager's vision on multiple fronts. However, as evident by last season and pre-season, we are still some defensive quality away from sustaining an assault for CL qualification from the PL or EL side.

Most optimistic scenario, 4-5th place. Semis or Final in EL. Don't see us making it far in domestic cup competitions since Pochettino will place CL qualification at the top of his priorities due to the effort/reward ratio.

Most pessimistically - assuming we've got the best defensive signings for this season we're going to get and our team doesn't pick up on Pochettino's strategy too well - 5th or 6th. We'll get knocked out at the quarter finals of the EL.

Way I see it, Chelsea, Man City, and Arseholenal (but these dumbasses have yet to secure another striker to back-up Giroud) are favorites to get Top 3. 

Liverpool might encounter the same problem we did last season and they will have to realize what the true price of CL qualification means. Man United, though they have LvG, need more than Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera. Barcelona just acquired Vermaelen (and as a Barca fan, I'm so disappointed but everyone at that sub is drinking the koolaide). Along with a B2B, they need to replace Rio and Vidic. I don't know how they will accomplish all this in 3 weeks. Then there is Everton. While Martinez is great and they have Lukaku, I think they were aided by Man U and ourselves performing below our own standards. 

This means that the 4th spot can be ours for the taking. Even 3rd place if Pochettino has EVERY player firing on all cylinders, implementing his system while using Vertonghen (and hopefully Musacchio) and Lloris to protect the leads his attacking system can easily create.

true,votingprawn,eng-somerset,Somerset,"&gt; There's some really interesting and affordable (to insure anyway!) motors out there for young people if they don't go the Corsa/Fiesta/Golf route.

Definitely.  My first vehicle (even passed my test in it) was a 2.5L turbo diesel pickup truck, cost about £800 to insure if memory serves.  I'm sure that doesn't sound too interesting, but I had some great fun in that thing.  Lots of grunt and an incredibly useful vehicle to have around.  Although in the winter I had to put half a ton of gravel in the back just to maintain traction.

Current car is a '97 Merc S-class, 3.2L with an LPG conversion.  The majority of my premium is a Manchester tax, which puts the quotes up by nearly £1k with some companies!  Finally got it down to about £600 (still £200 more than quotes for outside Manchester).

I definitely think there are ""gaps"" in the insurance company algorithms for things like old Mercs.  You get can get a lot of car for £3k, and young driver + luxury saloon car somehow seems to avoid the instant £2000 insurance quotes.",0,1407673760,null,0,false,0,cjm5r5y,t3_2d4rml,t1_cjm5r5y,t1_cjm505p,null,1435165528,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

With arguably weaker ''balanced'' teams, while making 40m NET profit on transfers in that time and also the 5th highest TV money last season. We're just as ''best off'' as the other 6 listed. 

On paper I would say now we have the best manager we've had in years, a mix of Man Management/Motivation, EPL Proven Tactics, Great with Youth and real Football Experience. 'Arry, AVB and Tactics Tim all lacked at least one of those key aspects. On paper I would say we have the most balanced team now we've had in years - and we've arguably had our ''replace our star'' player season now that Liverpool will go through with Suarez and signing players.

Looks a bit different then, doesn't it? LvG is literally only human and for all his ''first season'' successes it could backfire spectacularly. We also made ''strong signings'' last season, beating Liverpool to them last year and they finished 2nd and we finished 6th. I feel like Liverpool will do a Spurs this year. The rest? Everyone strengthens every year, like I said. Every season it's ''fuck, xxx got xxx player, we're screwed!''. Fuck, Chelsea got Shevchenko! Fuck, Chelsea got Torres! Fuck, Chelsea got Costa! You can see where I'm going with this. Providing we can improve our results against them and more importantly the teams below us, we'll be fine. It's always been small point differences, we're never 15/20 points off CL football even last year. If we can stamp out games where we've thrown away 1-0 leads vs Everton to a 2-1 loss in injury time, or collapsed against West Ham then we'll be fine. 

I remember last season we had by far the most key players out injured by minutes. Arsenal argue it's them by a tiny margin (as always), but we lost more key players - Diaby for them doesn't count. And also Spurs committed 21 errors that lead to a goal in the PL last season; more than Cardiff, Hull, Newcastle, Chelsea and WBA combined (20). Now, imagine how that 6th place finish under shit circumstances would look without that statistic over our head? And imagine if we weren't worse off injury wise? Lots of that bullshit last season.

true,196884,null,null,"Quick thoughts :

This is a dress rehearsal, with BR's putting out his current starting 11. As expected, we are going to be playing a lot of 4-2-3-1 this season. The surprising thing is that Can is the other ""2"" instead of Henderson, and Henderson has been pushed to the ""3"" (Hendo-Coutinho-Sterling). We interchange the 3 often and we are so quick that BVB couldn't find the shape to counter it -- basically we own the space in front of the box for th whole game.

We looked super sharp (some of it also because BVB is really rusty, but they started off with well in the first 10 mins with their trademark pressing and we beat the pressing again and again). Koeman will be shatting in his pants -- ""how the hell am I going to stop this team"".

Defensively, Lovren has really brought a huge improvement. Ok, we played a rusty BVB side, but you can see Lovren commanding the box. Notice how many times he push the whole line up, and I am very impressed with the way he looks around for his man, and making tiny adjustments in his position. He is almost like a finesse defender -- every inch is considered. Totally enjoyable to watch (it's a bit frustrating when the camera is off him -- I want to see the rest of his game and I bet his off-ball positioning is top notch). He makes Skrtel better.

Player thoughts :

Coutinho and Sterling -- these guys are our Suarez replacement. I am usually fairly calm in watching games, but man their link-up play is pure *filth*. 

Manquillo : looking incredibly assured for a 20 yo who just started 7 games last season. He is neat, strong, and has super technique. He will keep Flanagan out if he plays like this.

Sturridge : this guy is looking hungry. His goal is brilliant -- all the 3 touches he took to bring the ball under control and the outside foot shot completely took the GK by surprise.

true,DevilishRogue,cnty-england,England,"&gt; Israel started this by launching air strikes and arresting large numbers of Hammas [sic] personnel ***after*** 3 Israeli settlers were murdered in Palestine, an act they later admitted had nothing to do with Hammas [sic] leadership

""After""? So Israel didn't start this?

Also, whether the three Israeli boys were murdered on a direct command from Hamas leaders or not, they were murdered by Hamas operatives, so highlighting that they didn't have a direct command to do so misses the point entirely.

&gt; They provoke Hammas [sic] until they get a response (rockets) 

They [provoked Hamas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Palestinian_rocket_attacks_on_Israel,_2002%E2%80%9306) by unilaterally [withdrawing from Gaza?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Palestinian_rocket_attacks_on_Israel,_2007) 

&gt; Also, lets be clear, the IDF continue to operate within Gaza during 'ceasefire', so it's rather one sided, imagine if Hammas [sic] were operating in Israel during a ceasefire, how long would that last!

There is a bit of a difference between dismantling terrorist infrastructure during a ceasefire and launching rocket attacks against a civilian population.

They start with a real event to make their shit look a bit better. What they are trying to do is to get you to swallow the shit that comes next.

Here the shit that came next was, ""Hitler wasn't all horrible"".

When you're claiming aliens are in charge of the planet, I couldn't care less. When you're planting in the mind of potentially impressionable people, especially if they are young people, that Hitler wasn't all that bad, it makes me really uncomfortable.

Lamela, Eriksen, Holtby, Chadli, Townsend, Lennon

Soldado, Ade, Kane

My preferred starting XI:

Hugo

Walker - Kaboul - Vert - Rose

Capoue - Bentaleb

Lamela - Eriksen - Chadli

Soldado

Obviously that's all subject to change if we bring in Mateo, Yedlin, or Schneiderlin. Mateo and Yedlin are not homegrown, and would require that another non homegrown player be taken out to accommodate them. 


As for that starting XI, I really don't know who will start next to Capoue at DM. I don't think Paulinho and Mousa suit the suit, Holtby might be a smidge to reckless in the tackle. Also I fucking love Bentaleb. 

As for the other attacking spot, that's 100% up in the air. I could see Eriksen and Lamela being played as a pair of interchanging 10s with Holtby or Chadli filling in the gaps. Or Townsend for that matter. Soldado up top is because he's actually had a preseason, and looked damn good in it. He should start the season, and I think he'll play well enough to lock down the top job. 

In defense healthy Kaboul is a must start next to Vert. And Rose has been playing out of his skin trying to win that starting LB spot. 

Edit:  Took off Carroll because numbers.  And honestly, I'd be perfectly content with this squad.

Theres no coincidence that, in world football, player loyalty isn't as strong as it used to be. Celtic fans can remember king henrick, sutton, hartson as players who could have possibly got better deals at other clubs but stayed as they became celtic fans. Our club is unlike many clubs as it used to command loyalty from players. We dont really have that anymore, we dont have a strong enough squad or an ambitious board so now we are treding water and slowly becoming a very weak side. I dont think the porto method is our only option. Plus i don't have much faith in our scouting set up. (Wanyama aside) 

i think we've also got a problem with the declining state of irish and scottish footballer quality. As many irish, scottish and welsh players would go to celtic at the end of their careers or mid way through (craig bellamy, hartson, keanos ect) although they didnt all play too well. They were big name signings with roots to celtic and reasons to follow them.now irelands pretty much a championship side, its affected us.

Then we have a board who wont challenge because, well why would they? They can still keep winning the spl and having an odd go at europe. But if they try to challenge fans expextations would grow and pressure would be put on them to spend even more.

I wanted keane to be manager, although not the best in england Keano would have suited us as he has a connection to the club and good for the fans hed have probably pissed off the board, but he might have got a bit more money than it appears delias getting.

BMI = weight(kg)/ height(m)^2, so that BMI assumes someone of twice the height is four times the weight for the same BMI. 

Unfortunately, this isn't the correct exponent to use (it was originally just arbitary instead of carefully planned). This is why BMI overestimates obesity in tall people and underestimates it in short people. Some small portion of the measured obesity epidemic is a result of people growing taller as opposed to increased body fat.

If tall people were literally just bigger versions of short people, the correct exponent would be 3.

true,iaindings,null,null,"1 - don't make assumptions. Small cars with small engines aren't necessarily cheaper than larger cars. It's about risk profile, not dimensions or engine cc. I had a 1.8 306 as my first car and a 2.0 mondeo as my second. I paid less for insurance than my friends with 1.0 corsas. So many young people get tiny cars because they think they're cheaper to insure, which means more are crashed. I've always had larger cars and they have been consistently cheaper to insure than the stereotypical small hatch. A non issue now as I'm 30 and my boat of a 508 estate costs 300 quid a year mind.

2 - be honest on your quotes. Don't try and fudge facts and definitely don't try fronting (being a named driver on parents policy) - as well as being illegal it's often more expensive in the long run. Add your parents as additional drivers to your policy though - it's perfectly legal and means they can use your car if they need to. This will bring the price down

3 - understand the difference between correlation and causation. Then understand that insurance is entirely about correlation and not at all about causation. Just like point 1, just because it doesn't make immediate sense, it doesn't make the whole system unjust and unfair. It may seem counterintuitive that parking on the road would cost less than parking in a garage, but if there's a decreased risk factor then you pay less, even without an obvious causation. Don't get pissed off and decide the system is corrupt, it's just statistics. Use this to your favour - keep point 2 in mind but there are perfectly honest ways to change your quote. My job can fall into about 4 different titles for example, I know which one generally gives the cheapest prices.

4 - most importantly, understand that each insurance company is selling a product and each will have a market they specialise in. All the mainstream insurers will specialise in mainstream customers - the mid 30s with a no claims bonus driving a diesel golf. They don't want your business because you're not their target market. 

5 - comparison sites are really just comprised of mainstream insurers, use them as a rough guide but don't think that's as low as the prices can get. Find some brokers and specialists (Adrian flux, sky insurance both spring to mind) and pick up the phone. Put the legwork in, keep making calls and haggle with them. If they quote 1500, tell them you'll sign now if they can get it down to 1000. Like any company selling a product, they have margins and sales targets so there's always a deal to be done. Every young person I've heard complaining about ridiculous prices has just thrown the details into comparethemeerkat. It's not going to be cheap, but it'll come down soon enough.

Applied before the deadline in 2013 and I saved the application which said that I would receive the £9000 tuition fees to be paid to the university. Come the declaration, it turns out I was getting £3465. Get told lots of misinformation, get told by advisors to change the course myself to something else then back and that should fix it by making another assessment being done (made things worse).

It wasn't until October last year that I was down to get the £9000 for it, but then the payments weren't scheduled, and I didn't realise. Nor when I submitted the travel grant form as I spent a semester in Canada.

&gt; Ask your agent to Tier 2 something as that puts them through to an experienced agent who can give a second opinion. Just do expect to be put on hold for a few minutes.

I ended up being passed on to Tier 2 in late June this year and it was much more helpful. I finally got told that the manual assessors forgot to schedule the payments (previous ones told me 'it takes time', or that 'the university hasn't done 'x'').

I am Head of Community over at giffgaff and the one running the consultation linked in this thread.  I have been watching the conversation and while I fully understand peoples concerns I do want to try and respond to some of the themes coming out of this. 

Firstly, we are by no means trying to hide this vote from our members. We are in the process of emailing all those who will likely be impacted by this over the coming couple of days and have already been sending emails out since Thursday. Unfortunately, when emailing a large number of people we have to do it in waves so that it doesn't get flagged as spam. So if you have not received one already then you should get it within the next couple of days. The email will in part cover what we are trying to do, provide links with how to get involved and show you your last three months usage so that you can make an informed decision on if this will impact you or not.

Secondly, we have been having open conversations with our community over the last few months around the data experience on giffgaff, namely our download speeds, and have heard many calls for it to improve. As we continue to grow these calls will become louder and louder and therefore we need to do something in order to service the data needs of the vast majority of members. We have a finite capacity, as does any network, and the changes we are proposing are aimed at ensuring the vast majority of our members can continue using the goodybag they were, without impact, but those who wish to abuse the amount of data they consume will have to pay more for it. 

For many, having unlimited at £12 was peace of mind rather than a consumption need. Because of this we want to roll out some more initiatives to help make sure people are aware of the data they are using and allow them to make decisions for themselves. For example, we will be setting up an alert service which will SMS members when they hit certain thresholds of data (such as 80%). We will also be allowing members to purchase their next goodybag early if they find that they are running out of data or minutes - no longer will you have to wait for its expiry.

The changes outlined are not for monetary gain - we accept that some members will leave us as a result of these changes. But I do want to say that this difficult choice has been made in order for us to provide a good level of sustainable service to all the members who choose to be with giffgaff. 

Anyway, thanks for all the feedback and comments here, if you would like to take part in the consultation then I look forward to seeing your views there too. ",0,1407682329,null,0,false,0,cjm8504,t3_2d1zsw,t1_cjm8504,t3_2d1zsw,null,1435166650,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

The trouble was that when asked if they thought their own child was obese/overweight, hardly any of them did (less than 1/3).  It was just a problem that happened to other people's kids.  Ads encouraging parents to get their overweight kids more active doesn't work because parents don't think their kid is overweight.

But to address your arguments:

&gt; I've already said the rocket fire is stupid, but that's what you get when you imprison people in Gaza

Except the rocket fire came before the restrictions on movement and the restrictions would stop if the violence against Israel stopped.

&gt; enforce a blockade that barely allows enough to live

A blockade that is necessary to prevent further armaments being shipped into Gaza to be used against civilians and would stop if the violence against Israel stopped.

&gt; and provides no hope for the future

Which could change overnight if the violence from Hamas stopped.

&gt; then you start arresting large numbers 

Again which would stop if the violence stopped.

&gt; and start air striking them

*Again* which would stop if the violence stopped. Are you noticing a common pattern here?

&gt; SOME of the people are going to be pissed off, don't you think?

Yes. Some will even blame Israel and be ""pushed into the arms of Hamas"", but most realise that Hamas is the cause of their suffering and that it would stop if Hamas stopped the violence. 

&gt; And they will do whatever they can to retaliate.

No. Most who blame Israel will do little more than bad mouth it, protest and maybe throw stones. Very few will take up arms and those that do will be hunted down and killed by Israel even if innocent civilians are also killed during the process of killing the terrorist. Thus terrorists know that they bring danger to innocent Palestinians around them - there can be no excuses that Hamas are trying to help the Palestinian people.

&gt; it's easy to discard Palestinian lives by throwing around the terrorist word.

This seems to be a way of thinking that only critics of Israel adopt. Other than speaking out of anger like Joan Rivers did when confronted at the airport, I've yet to see even the Hawks argue that Palestinian lives don't matter. Personally I am an advocate of absolute disproportionate response but even I have taken the number of civilian deaths into account (both in the short term and the longer term) when forming my opinion.

&gt; So if you accept that retaliation is inevitable (I'm sure you don't, but still..) 

Retaliation against Israel for responding or against Hamas for causing the response? For what it's worth, I do concede your point that just as you are adopting the political stance you hold on this issue, so to will some Palestinians in Gaza blame Israel instead of Hamas for the deaths of lovved ones and the destruction of their homes.

&gt; then you have to look at the options they have for retaliation. Firing rockets is pretty much all they have.

They used to have suicide bombing until the security barrier was put up. They also have renouncing violence and condemning Israel for using violence, but this only has credibility if the violence against Israel stops and Israel continues to use violence, which I believe to be unlikely now that Israel has accomplished the destruction of most terrorist infrastructure in Gaza.

&gt; They are not accurate, targeted weapons, they would not be effective against military targets. So to say they attack civilians is a red herring

It is not a Red Herring, they are specifically aimed at civilian targets, did you not know this? They cannot be steered once fired, but their trajectory can be planned. Besides, even if it couldn't that still wouldn't make it okay. 

&gt; especially given the number of Palestinian civilians killed VASTLY outnumbers Israeli civilians

&gt; As for the Palestinian deaths outnumbering Israeli deaths, one has to ask the question, why? It was asking this question that turned me against the Palestinian cause back when I was a naive student. There is [a relatively unbiased article about this at Vox, here](http://www.vox.com/2014/7/30/5937119/palestinian-civilian-casualties-gaza-israel). Other than getting it wrong about Hamas using Human Shields:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMUdU3AqlyQ 

http://www.barenakedislam.com/2014/07/25/hamas-savagely-beats-gaza-civilians-who-heed-idf-calls-to-leave-targeted-areas/

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/24/israeli-strike-un-school-gaza-kills-women-children

It is a pretty good piece.

As for Chomsky, he is an intellectual lightweight outside of linguistics. I could beat him in a debate. He also talks bullshit e.g. his comments about [Hamas ceasing rocket attacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Palestinian_rocket_attacks_on_Israel,_2012), that Hamas was not responsible for the [deaths of the three Israeli boys](http://www.timesofisrael.com/palestinians-say-teens-killing-planned-and-funded-by-hamas/), or that the murder of the three boys was anything other than the [straw that broke the camels back](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Palestinian_rocket_attacks_on_Israel,_2014) in Israel responding to ongoing attacks. Chomsky is a charlatan.

true,IHadaFishOnce,RU,russia,"&gt; There isn't one part of his game which even comes close to Oscar

Oscar can work on his final ball. Rarely do you see Oscar pulling that one through ball that splits a defense in two and sets Torres/Eto'o/Ba/Willian/Hazard through. Coutinho is more natural at it. When Suarez was out for 5 games in the beginning of 13/14, Coutinho took over as the creative player and really linked up well with Sturridge. And when Sterling was on the up, Coutinho was a big part of his development. Suarez also profited off of Coutinho's delivery. 

Oscar is more likely to take on defenders and latch on to the final ball from say, Mata, Fabregas or Hazard. Coutinho is more likely to be behind it. While Oscar in truth would be labelled as a creative player or a number 10, he's more of a natural Attacking Midfielder. And if you want to suggest that Oscar does have the final ball, then I would like an explanation for why we were missing that final ball against Palace, Sunderland, and the other games we lost.

Furthermore, the BoE doesn't really care about keeping the value up, it always changes as it is an internationally traded currency. If they needed to do it so badly, they'd take money out of circulation.

I find it disingenuous that the SNP have lied to the people of Scotland so much about this - they have made you all think that the ball is in Scotland's court. It isn't. In fact, far from it. No debt deal, no assets, no EU entry (which will not happen anywhere because of Spain and Belgum), no admittance to NATO (which won't happen unless you allow Faslane to stay open which if the SNP doesn't allow the UK will annex), and so on.

The UK can choose to cut off its nose to spite its face if it likes. Scotland leaving the pound will affect the value of it. The suggestion that we won't be in the EU is laughable. You mentioned Spain, I'm sure they'd be happy taking all their fishing ships out Scottish waters. Also it would take David Cameron 30 minutes to make a call and find out what the EU situation is which he refuses to do. It's just politics.

Realistically, Scotland will continue to use the pound and be in the EU because it's in everyone's best interests. Even in the worst case scenario where this doesn't work out, we'd still have an improved democracy which is what we really want anyway.

Scotland is a net contributor to the UK and EU. It's in a good position to negotiate the terms.

The quality is OK, on the front the button is more of a clear yellow rather than solid (first thing my friends spotted) and the fabric on the back is totally different. The genuine kit has a textured back whereas this one has no texture (noticeable if someone were to be standing directly behind you)

It's only $25 delivered in comparison, so a massive saving. Up to you if you'd be happy with it. They personalise it too, however, beware, as I also bought a Henderson shirt, and the text on the back is straight and overlaps to the sleeves, rather than being rounded.

If you get champions league patches, they also add a 3rd ""respect"" badge under the trophy badge - which will make it stand out to passers by.

true,danbarkr,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"Voting Yes directly rewards the SNP who have constantly voted against Scotland's interest in the commons to drive a wedge between it. 

You miscalculate the situation in Spain. They have had wars and terrorist groups fight for it. It is unquestionable that they will not allow Scotland to enter as it sets an example and nor will Belgum and nor will France and nor will the UK (remember, it only takes one to veto).  Furthermore, the debt and deficit (which Scotland does run) would be too large for entry into the EU. It's a non-starter and, to be honest, I don't know how more has not been made out of this. 

And again, on the currency - it isn't in the best interest of the UK. Yes voters can say all they want about 'its our pound as well' but it isnt. It is the UK pound. Not England's, not Wales', not Scotland's. 

And finally, the alleged 'democratic deficit' is a strong one, but as we just have had a referendum on AV in which Scotland voted the same way as everywhere else, its pretty difficult to complain about. And remember, 25% of a 50% turnout voted for the SNP, yet they have divided Scotland up in a pretty disgusting way. So there is a democratic deficit, but thats in Hollyrood. (and we've come out of 13 years of labour governments and scotland actually has c.20% of people voting conservative etc. etc.)

true,Ms_moonlight,eng-westmidlands,West Midlands,"Ugh. Double ugh. Triple ugh. Here's my recommendation: 

1\. Join a forum. I was on this one: http://www.uk-yankee.com/ There are hundreds of people there trying to do the same thing you're trying to do. This will offer support when visas take six months to go through, and when your girlfriend has a difficult time with culture shock.

2\. Sort out some sort of plan for your girlfriend: financially, visa, education, whatever. She can be a student here, but she will have to pay international fees unless she has been here over three years. (
Source: http://www.ukcisa.org.uk/International-Students/Fees--finance/Home-or-Overseas-fees/) If she comes as an international student, she will have to prove that she has a certain amount of money to support herself each month with bank statements. A company could sponsor her, but she needs something that's really in need to prove that she could do the job better than a UK national or EU national. 

If you wish to marry her, you'll have to be making quite a bit of money to sponsor her. 

3\. Stay with relatives when you get here. To find a job, you'll need internet access, a phone, an address, and a national insurance number. That is going to be difficult from a hotel. It may take quite a bit of time/money to get those things together if you rent a flat. 

4\. Mobile phones

You can pick up a sim in lots of places. When I went to an official shop (orange shop back in the day), I needed an address. However, now you can just pick them up at Sainsburys. I'm not sure if it needs to be registered or not.

MUCH cheaper than the US. My mother and I are on similar plans I pay a fraction of what she pays.

5\. I had no job when we rented our first place (my husband did) and they made us pay six months of rent. The agency managing our flat is awful though.

6\. If you want to get married, do it in the US. In most places you can walk into a registry office, do it, get out, and have the paperwork in a few days at most. You can use that paper work to apply for a visa. You'll need to be making quite a bit of money now to support her. 

7\. Spend a lot of time on this site: https://www.gov.uk/apply-uk-visa and the expat forums. Develop a plan and get familiar with it. I did this over a year before I moved here, and my transition from US to dual national went incredibly smoothly (although it was expensive). This was because I took the time to do research and explained it carefully to my family in the US, my husband, and his relatives. We were all very familiar with what needed to be done and you should be too. ",0,1407689015,null,0,false,0,cjmatm6,t3_2d312i,t1_cjmatm6,t3_2d312i,null,1435167980,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Someone I know told me that if you pay the yearly option then you still have to pay £1 every day you use one, although I thought that you just had to have at least a £1 credit available in case you ran over the free 30 mins. Either way people are finding it confusing and it's not a very intuitive system, in fact I'd say it's quite restrictive.

So much *forced* ideology gets in the way to divide people most of the time. thanks. Agree with 99% of what you said. There are a few things like productivity were I disagree on, due to interpretation BUT there is only one worth expressing. Well two things, one being the minimum wage which needs upped to about £10ph. Will focus on the other one though.

**Employment Agencies** (it's far more serious than most people realise, by an order of magnitude)

* Agency Workers Regulations 2010 did literally nothing, financially speaking regarding new agency workers going into established workforces. [Swedish Derogation model is used as a loophole](http://blogs.mirror.co.uk/investigations/2011/10/heres-more-evidence-that-the.html) to avoid paying ""equal wages"" to existing workers. So you still have two workers doing exactly the same job and one who usually gets paid the minimum with an agency also getting paid.

* Agency workers regulation does nothing when there is no **comparable** full time company worker. Factories, call centers, distribution networks, cafes, retail outlets etc... can have full workforces made solely of ""Agency workers"". It's not isolated to ""low skill"" workforces either. Our economy being services heavy is relevant.

* IMAGE: [At least 75% of ""available jobs"" are ""temporary"" agency work.](http://i.imgur.com/JXXSDql.png) It has been that way for years. Think about the overall effects of that and how it affects workers income. Literal middlemen. Because legal and cheaper if a worker is ""temp"", ""flexible"", ""agency"".

Increasing dramatically over the last 10 years... to now, 75% of people getting jobs have done so with an ""agency"". Agencies don't exist in the same capacity that they used to. Before ""temporary work"" was more costly due to the fact it was temporary. Now ""temporary"", ""agency"" or the new bullshit term ""flexible"" workers are just a form of cheap labor. The agency gets as much as it can. The agency pays workers as little as possible. It also uses a lot of tricks to limit their liability and force inefficient but higher worker count workforces. A new worker may only perform at 50% relative to an experienced worker with several years (skill / experience). Pay the workers minimum and hire two workers. 


""Agency work"" in it's current form is terrible for our economy. It's a race to the bottom of minimum wages. It's nearly at that point for the majority. IMAGE: [Work 40hours at minimum wage, after tax... you still have an income more than 30% of others](http://i.imgur.com/GCLy9FU.png). That is shocking. If your household has £400pw after tax income, you are in the top 30%. 70% of the UK have a less household income.  http://www.ifs.org.uk/wheredoyoufitin/


You can't ignore the ""fudges"" either. 5pence/ph more than minimum wage. 8hour contracts are not zero hour contracts even if you regularly work 40hours/pw. etc... Agencies are a cancer in their current form. Long term ""temporary"" workers are the norm. Agencies acting as HR and sourcing full time workers is rare nowadays.

The solution is to raise minimum wage for agency workers to a significant higher level. £10ph minimum wage, £12ph minimum wage for agency staff.

Hope I expressed and articulated the seriousness of the ""Agency work"" problem. Agencies are complicit in lowering wages to as close to minimum wage as possible. That is how they profit. 75% of available jobs, remember that. How long until it's 75% of the actual workforce. No fallacy of outcome intended...The people they have access to are the 7% unemployed. A lot of people will at some stage be unemployed. All those will be exposed to that 75% of available jobs are ""temporary"".

Gerrard picked up the ball on the right and crossed it out to Enrique on the left. I was pretty close to the touchline and the ball moved straight at me.  What was so amazing was that it moved with great pace, and in a perfect straight line. And of course it landed on Jose's boot. 

Most players would slice or curl it slightly, but Stevie seems to be able to just ping it in a way that makes it go perfectly straight.

Second, I was trying to provide some larger context for everything that has happened, and so I quite deliberately picked only major events or irrevocable decisions to cover.

Mandatory Palestine was cast as England since 1) when I wrote this last week it was specifically to answer someone claiming ""I'd be firing rockets too,"" and also consciously to make the Palestinian narrative more sympathetic, since I'm aware I side with Israel and so was trying to present the best possible motivations I could find for Palestinian actions - I'm not sure I succeeded.

The public lap up speaches yes. When speaches have content. When speaches are just repetitive rhetoric, full of thought terminating cliches and buzzwords, the promotion of utopian ideals, and propagation of millenarian fears, it becomes a problem. The fact is that contemporary politicians are more or less administrators of a political system. They make decisions, raise issues, address concerns.  So we should be judging them on thier ability to make good decisions, not thier ability to rouse a crowd. Times have changed.

That is unless Chadli, Lennon &amp; Townsend are good enough for a team pushing the top 4 - which they're not. Chadli is more suited to playing central, and is built like a middleweight boxer and not a fluid attacking winger. Lennon doesn't work in the system as he's a traditional RW, with zero end product, and Townsend hasn't learnt a thing and imo is good for a dozen backup games, but not close to being the quality we need to challenge the top 4 as again - he also has zero end product.

They have Casillas. Navas and Casillas is just fine for them. 

The whole reason Lopez is leaving is because they would never let Casillas go, even though Lopez is better.

Varane is ~~one of~~ the best young defender in the world. This whole idea of him coming to Chelsea makes no sense, from both the side of Real Madrid and the player. He wouldn't get anymore playing time here than he would at Madrid. He is at **Real** fucking **Madrid**. He is practically playing with the next wave of Galacticos now.

Now lets look at the club, basically the richest club in the world, if Madrid wants a player they will pay the money for him, its as simple as that. If Madrid want to buy Cech, they will just do it, they don't need to swap anyone. Especially not their prized young defender.

I'd even consider dropping Yaya where necessary, for the greater good of the team.

When he's good, he's exceptional. But when he's bad, he's utterly terrible.

We can't afford to carry passengers in the big games this season.

Mancini realised that Yaya can't be relied upon defensively, and made changes where necessary. I think Pellegrini has to be less stubborn with the 4-4-2 and recognise this himself.

Big question marks over Yaya.

In all honesty I'd rather we shipped him out this summer and replaced him with someone like Pogba or Barkley.

I don't even necessarily think it was always great off the ball movement - i'm not gonna try make out it was all just ''luck'' or something as Sheringham wasn't just ''lucky'' nor was Inzaghi but nothing about Kane suggests he'll be leading the line in 2-3 years time. He doesn't seem to have any real notable qualities. Technique is average, heading, shooting/finishing, strength, passing, dribbling, flair, off the ball/space, holding it up - he's just very...Kane. Like a...much more mediocre Striker version of Thomas Muller. Scoring goals is very important, and man if he can hit 20 a season I'll be delighted but he doesn't seem to offer much else and I don't think he'll hit that either in his career.

Like that user said 

&gt; Realistically, neither Soldado nor Ade will be leading the line for us in 2-3 years' time... is Kane the man to take their place then? I don't see it at the moment.

I just don't either. By then I see him sold for 5-8m to a club like QPR, Hull, Sunderland and being a decent Prem striker. If I'm wrong - I would *love* to be wrong, an Academy striker leading the line for us banging them in? Great. But I don't see it. *Especially* for a club that has top 4 aspirations and plays with one up top. It's gonna take a monumental amount of improvement for him to reach that.

Is that an active focus decision on the part of the force, or just what the majority of call-outs are? Why are medical experts not brought in then to deal with the medical care side of any mental issues - the police responsibility beginning and ending with ensuring the safety and security of all involved - no more or less. 

Assuming mental health issues are the focus - wouldn't it make more sense to have a special ruling to allow medical disclosure without consent in the case of those who it is deemed are a risk to themselves or others? 

That way the rest of us can have some resemblance of privacy - rather than medical records being a completely open book to anyone who's a part of the police force. 

Given the articles information - it looks like they're looking at complete disclosure for anyone they want to take an interest in. You don't have to be a mental health patient, you could even be a *victim* and still they would seek the right to view that information.

true,muckter,null,null,"Firstly, like someone else said, the tracksuit-wearing chav is really a 2000s phenomenon that was mainly prevalent in impoverished inner cities, although the trend for wearing trackies during the 2000s extended way beyond that (I live in a village and everyone wore them). It was by no means exclusive to the Essex or London area so it is certainly not just Cockney accents. Most people who 10 years ago would have worn tracksuits and hoodies and hung around street corners now tend to wear graphic t shirts and skinny jeans and go on lads' holidays to Magaluf or Zante. TV shows like ""The Only Way is Essex"" are good examples of this new culture. The change in fashions can be seen just walking round shopping centres in Britain. 10 years ago most shops would have had polo shirts, hoodies and trackies with brands like Adidas whereas now there are only one or two shops like Sports Direct that sell this type of clothes. However, there is still a prevailing underclass in certain cities, especially in the North of England, where the stereotypes of a lack of ambition, living off benefits, wearing tracksuits, teenage pregnancy etc is still true. But the days where chav culture, mainly in terms of clothes but also a yobbish, intimidatory attitude, online (""U wot m8"") and in the street, was integrated into wider society ended about 5 years ago.

As for your main question about why tracksuits in particular are popular among chavs, there is no single answer. Ultimately, it is just a fashion, and fashions come and go for no reason. I would suggest that it could be to do with its relative low cost and the fact that most chavs are football fans and young chavs tend to play football in the street and tracksuits are suitable clothes for this.",0,1407696425,null,0,false,0,cjme5kf,t3_2d5ums,t1_cjme5kf,t3_2d5ums,null,1435169551,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

Ozil? Debuchy? Cheap players?

Liverpool:

- Sterling is going to be our second top scorer this season. Garantueed. Starter.
 
- Couthino will get the most assists. We channel almost every attack through him so he's most likely to start every game. He's been ridiculousy good in pre-season. Not many people have bought him so his price will rise early on.

- Manquillo will be a cheap defender (if you're game enough to have a LFC defender in your team). He gets forward a lot and will be getting a few assists this year. Might be a rotation risk though.

- Henderson: I would hold off on him for now. He will play most games but I don't think he will be played in such a advanced position as today.

- Stevie G: a bit pricey but he will still take our penalties, free kicks, and corners - we scored a lot of goals from pens and corners last season.

Because it wouldn't be run by a for profit cpmpany. Meaning current profit margins can be used to substantially reduce the cost of fares, or if budgeted correctly you could remove fare costs entirely.

This would have a huge impact on cost of living as currently commuting or fuel is a big expense for many (for example, I currently spend £2500 a year on travel. That's over 10% of my annual wage pre tax.) Another benefit would be the reduction in emissions - 1 train carriage can remove a potential 50+ cars off the road.

I was just behind the goal that they scored in, and it looked to me like Steven Davis went for the ball at the front post, pretty much missed it but got a slight deflection on it and so it completely threw Pelle behind him. Silly mistake from Davis, maybe a slight lack of concentration, but from what I saw little blame could be put on Pelle.  
  
I thought Isgrove looked lively and energetic, but really low on quality. He had a few chances to get at his full back and just didn't trouble him Also, it really showed how little him and Bertrand had played together. Even though Tadic had a quiet game, him and Clyne looked so much cleverer on the right flank, and were able to link up much more. Quite a few times Bertrand would have the ball and Isgrove would neither come short to play a 1-2 or look to go over the top. I thought it made Bertrand look bad because it looked like he didn't want to get rid of the ball when in fact Isgrove wasn't showing for a pass. I'm much more worried about Isgrove now than I was before today.  
  
I always get angry watching Ramirez play for us. He just winds me up no end. The amount of times he gave the ball away today infuriated me. It wasn't just the number, but the positions he was in and the wrong decisions he made. I'm still not going to give up on him, I'm hoping that if he gets more solid game time these are the kind of decisions he'll become better at. I bloody hope so.

*Ethnocracy is a type of political regime, in which the state apparatus is appropriated by a dominant identity group (or groups) to further its interests, power and resources. Ethnocratic regimes typically display a combination of 'thin' democratic facade covering a more profound ethnic structure, in which ethnicity (or race, or religion) - and not citizenship - is the key to securing power and resources. An ethnocratic regime facilitates the ethnicization of the state by the dominant group, through the expansion of control, often through conflict with minorities and neighboring states. Ethnocracies therefore display their own logic of government, and are neither democratic, nor authoritarian or dictatorial.*

EH4 comes right into the city centre too, taking in places like the Dean Village and Stockbridge (which are nice), as well as Muirhouse (which is not so nice), and Cramond beyond that (which is nice).

You can see all these just by going to Google Maps and typing EH12 (or whatever) into the search box.

I think the suggestions that have been made about checking which bus routes run through/nearby where you'll be working are a good idea; if you can give us some bus routes to work with, we can advise which places on them are nice or not so nice (and, indeed, can you give us a hint as to what sort of area you'd like?

No. He's decent enough as a squad player at best, but we really should be taking any large (relative for him) offer that comes in. Ignoring his non existent end product - just think of the amount of build up and attacking opportunities that have been wasted with his shoot on sight policy which concedes possession straight back to the other team.

true,thedingoismybaby,cnty-uk,No luck catching them swans then?,"Unfortunately police are becoming untrained medical staff. The amount of time spent dealing with mental health issues, and vulnerable persons such as those suffering from dementia, learning disabilities, and so on is only increasing.

If police get called to someone having a mental health episode it is normally the officer who decides what happens next - are they sectioned? are they taken to hospital voluntarily? are they left at home? I've lost count of the amount of times I've had to make this decision with no social workers or ambulance staff available.

Often these decisions are made based on very limited information, and these decisions could save a life or ruin a life. Imagine sectioning someone who doesn't need it, because social services don't work after 5pm and the ambulance service can barely cover their jobs, so an overworked untrained officer makes a snap decision.

Or imagine not getting someone the help they need because they don't appear that bad currently, but it transpires they have a history of medical issues which the officer wasn't aware of and they go on to harm or kill themselves. The police can't do nothing but they can not be trained psychiatrists and mental health assessors as well as trained criminal investigators and everything else they are expected to do - something has to give.

I'd much rather police did not need to have this information, social services mental health teams, ambulance service and other agencies should cover this side of things and the police can focus on crime (as Theresa May said we should only be dealing with). But when it's 11pm on a Saturday night and someone with a clear mental health issue is walking down the road showing risk to themselves or others who is going to get called - 10 to 1 it won't be your local social services but it will be the only service that can't say no, the police.",0,1407702196,null,0,1407705893,0,cjmgtt8,t3_2d5uvc,t1_cjmgtt8,t1_cjmdmhe,null,1435170899,25,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,25

Nationalised companies have one goal, to provide the service they are made for, nobodies pockets to line, nobody to exploit just there to do the job. 

Private companies serve the consumer better when there is competition because competition + penny counting drives innovation, but only when both are present.
