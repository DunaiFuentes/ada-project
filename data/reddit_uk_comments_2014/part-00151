true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","&gt; Your attack on Shanghai was personal and, ironically enough, detracted from the argument at hand.

In your opinion it did, which is fair enough - but that is *your* opinion. 

&gt; You basically said we shouldn't believe what he says because he has a racist agenda. Totally out of line - his comment history, which I have looked at, and has not been deleted like yours, shows this to be untrue. 

I guess you're not looking in the right places then - or perhaps your agenda aligns with his (since you're replying in his defence again and again, he hasn't commented once?).

&gt; As I said in my previous comment, a point which you decided to disregard, it was wrong of Shanghai to make such an all encompassing statement.

I didn't ignore it - I just didn't focus on it (you're not quoting everything I said either), there was nothing more to say. *He was wrong* - we're having one hell of a debate on top of that, aren't we?

&gt; But these racist sentiments are often a byproduct of prejudice they have encountered in their lives. 

At what point can the shoe be on the other foot then? Are their racist sentiments in some way more valid or allowable than (for lack of a better term) white peoples? 

&gt; But the issue has far less potential to be dangerous then animosity against minorities.

Qualify that. Incidents of racism don't tend to happen in a royale rumble 'all against all' fights between everyone in a majority and everyone in a minority. At least you can see it's unacceptable regardless of your cultural background - but it still feels like you're trying to excuse it in some way. 

&gt; It certainly is on the rise, thanks to the behavior of small fringe groups such as Anjem Choudry and the Rigby killers. But it doesn't help when racist white folk go on twitter and call for the beheading of all Muslims, or accuse all Muslims of being sexual predators and the like. Something I have seen plenty of, mind you. If you think the racism white people suffer in this country is anything comparable to that incurred by minorities, you're either extremely ignorant or living in denial.

So have you gone looking for examples of this? If that's the case no doubt you'll find what you seek - but then I make a point of not looking at the Facebook propaganda of English Defense League etc. - I wouldn't consider that ignorant, I just don't turn over those rocks - I don't go looking for equivalent pro-Islamic (for instance) groups either. 

However the usual channels have filtered through shots of white people and black people alike calling for each others heads - at this stage I firmly believe both are in the wrong and the message should be equally strong against both. 

I see no reason to distinguish between minority and majority when it comes to leniency to racist tendencies. How can either group learn if you project the impression that the other party is getting an easier / harder time of it? That will only encourage. The only apt response is: ""No, you're *all* dickheads. Stop it.""

Unfortunately - again bringing it back to /u/ShanghaiNoon - that's exactly what his statement would prevent. Why should this thread be solely for bashing white people for a rise in racism? 

Are we not capable of agreeing how racism is universally bad - no exceptions? Apparently not - from his point of view. At least you do agree that in this case he cast the first stone and from my previous experience it's not the first time he has done so. I don't feel apologetic in calling him out on that.

They led 2-0 at half having had 46% possession and wound up seeing the game out 2-0 by limiting Everton's chances through more and more dominance of possession that largely stemmed from continuing to pressure Everton high up the pitch. This led to them ending the game with 54% possession.

There is more than one way to ""see out a game"" besides subbing off attack minded players for defensive minded ones, dropping the lines deeper, stop pressuring and look to clear from your defensive half more often and just invite more and more pressure on yourselves. That's often cited as bravely seeing the game out, defending what you have and blah blah blah, it is far more logical to continue with whatever type of play got you the lead in the first place.

&gt; You'll see it in practice when this thread becomes littered with ""it's against white people"" posts.

He never actually said all white people are to blame - merely that there would be counter claims of racism, which is precisely what you've done. 

I've stood up for Shanghai because I concede my views do align to some degree on this issue. Which makes sense considering I'm a British born Asian. My entire life I have been subjected to racism at various times, both subtle and threatening. But I harbor no ill sentiments over it, I understand the issues underpinning this behavior, namely, the politics of fear that drives these feelings. 
&gt; So have you gone looking for examples of this? 

I don't go out looking for these examples - I have experienced them first hand. I have been a victim of racism, and know how it can swell feelings of contempt. But fortunately I have been well educated enough to think abstractly and put these sentiments into a wider context. Not all my fellow Asians - along with certain racist Caucasians - have been fortunate enough to be given this kind of wisdom. 

&gt; Why should this thread be solely for bashing white people for a rise in racism?

It really isn't - nobody is bashing white people in general, only those sections of white society that view minorities with disdain, who are driven by fear and ignorance. Nobody is saying you are racist Fineus, but just as I have accepted that there is an issue of racism in the minority community, you must accept that there is a far greater threat from racism in the majority. Ultimately, it's not minorities that commit heinous acts like genocide, they simply do not have the power to do so.
&gt; Are we not capable of agreeing how racism is universally bad - no exceptions? 

Yes, it is universally bad, but the point I’m making is that is it exacerbated within minority communities when they feel they’re being misprepresented or unfairly vindicated. When over 30% of the popuation openly declared themselves prejudiced, I think we have every right to be concerned, considering minorities make up less than 15% of the population.

The Mail and Express have insanely right wing views and publish articles that wouldn't look out of place in a BNP manifesto, however they hold themselves to be better than that and loathe the BNP on principle. They like to think they represent the England of ""remember the days when..."" and always line up behind the Tories. It's a paper for people with enough of an interest in politics to get angry, but not enough to actually engage with the issues in a meaningful way.

&gt; 'Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog...

An old school colonialist 'non-whites/non-christians are barbarians!' fear with little grounding in fact. The idea that Islam somehow turns each and every follower into a blind and militant fanatic is patently ridiculous. 

Even Al-Qaeda and other Qutbist groups aren't just carrying out their awful acts because 'Islam tells them to', they do what they do for various political reasons infused with a reliocultural bent. This is merely colonial caricature and nothing more, and is disgusting as (and probably partly derived from) 'the barbaric Indians' that was popular after the Sepoy Revolt.

&gt; ...there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. The effects are apparent in many countries. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live.

Bullshit. If there was a fatalistic apathy inherent to Islam, then the Caliphates wouldn't be the centres of philosophy and science that they were. Closer to today, Iran wouldn't be the country with the greatest scientific growth in the world, Turkey wouldn't be the regional power it is, and more than half of the Next 11 economies wouldn't be majority Muslim. 

Once again, it's the old colonialist fantasy that Europe was able to conquer the world simply because they were more 'vigorous' than other 'stagnant' peoples. He sees poverty in countries that are Islamic and so blames Islam because it fits his preconceptions. It couldn't be a complex social, economic and political situation, oh no. It must be a simple easy answer that coinincidentally makes Christians look good. Such is the way of the Imperialist.

&gt; 'A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity.

I don't even know what the fuck he's talking about here. My guess is that he's seen too many Orientalist art pieces and is extrapolating from there. The idea that the 'Easterners' are effeminate and debased is as old as Greece and Rome. It's also bullshit. And it was also used to justify colonialism. I'm seeing a pattern with his trite pronouncements about multiple entire societies.

&gt; 'The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property – either as a child, a wife, or a concubine – must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men.

This isn't true either. While I would certainly agree that the Quran leaves a lot to be desired in how women are considered, so does the Talmud. To be honest, I don't give a damn what the holy book *says*, a religion is so much more than that. A religion is the collection of traditions and practices of its followers, and as someone who studies them academically, one *cannot* engage with a religion without engaging with the interpretive communities.

So, yes, some Islamic communities certainly have *awful* women's rights, such as Saudi Arabia and the Taliban in Afghanistan. I would even go so far to say that their religion certainly plays a part not only in legitimizing it, but in maintaining it or even forming it. 

But not all Muslims do believe that. Many do not, and what is Islam but what Muslims believe? In fact, [this](http://myriamfrancoiscerrah.wordpress.com/2014/05/23/oxford-union-debate-this-house-believes-islam-is-incompatible-with-gender-equality/) is a very interesting article by an Islamic feminist that goes into this far more than I'm going to, I would encourage you to read it. The point here is that a religion is not a monolithic block, as Churchill pretends it is. Nor is it all that defines these people.

&gt; 'Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the faith: all know how to die but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it.

Again, I've pretty much addressed the myth that Islam is an inherently military religion. And indeed, the developmental thing. In fact, Churchill's whiggish assumption that history is just one march toward progress - progress being, of course, what Europe is at this moment - is kind of utterly rejected in modern historical practice.

His response: *You'll see it in practice when this thread becomes littered with ""it's against white people"" posts.*

Seems pretty clear to me. 

&gt; I don't go out looking for these examples - I have experienced them first hand. I have been a victim of racism, and know how it can swell feelings of contempt. But fortunately I have been well educated enough to think abstractly and put these sentiments into a wider context. Not all my fellow Asians - along with certain racist Caucasians - have been fortunate enough to be given this kind of wisdom.  

Would it shock you to know that living in Birmingham - one of the most multicultural cities in the country - I've also seen subtle and threatening racism from non-white British demographics? Perhaps education is partly responsible - as someone who never stepped out looking for confrontation - I've certainly found myself experiencing most hostility from other ethnic groups than before.

A lot of what you go on to say does make sense - I appreciate it and respect it. 

The only thing I would question again is how the the post you linked to in the first place actually gathered its data. Was it entirely balanced between majority and minorities? Were the numbers skewed? Did they ask 2000 white British people and 1000 black immigrants? 

I don't doubt the existence or rise of racism - just that we're not given the tools and data from this survey to accurately decide anything much and (since every group is *capable* of racism) the only appropriate message to send is that it's bad across the board. Hate to keep saying it - but /u/ShanghaiNoon brought up white people as a particular demographic and - majority or minority - that's singling a group out to draw focus and sending the message that by inference it's not as serious for (minorities).",0,1401289200,null,0,false,0,cht52kh,t3_26mcji,t1_cht52kh,t1_cht4gkj,null,1433989642,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

But as has been mentioned, most people would be uncomfortable giving you information for next year, never mind 8-10 years time. Remember that whilst things are now improving, we have just come through the longest recession the UK has ever experienced. Things change very rapidly.

That said, we always need teachers and it is probably a safer career to aspire to than many others. However, as an NQT (newly qualified teacher), the pay is poor, the work is hard and it can be difficult to get a position in the good schools in the nice areas (like Cambridge). These areas can also be incredibly expensive to live in too (average house price in Cambridge was £357,639 in 2013, it will have risen since then).

You should definitely visit though, if it is a move that you would like to make then you should have a good idea what you are moving to. Travel around the country too, see some other places.

&gt; The Pope basically gave the same message recently:

“We are all tempted because the law of our spiritual life, our Christian life is a struggle: a struggle. That’s because the Prince of this world, Satan, doesn’t want our holiness, he doesn’t want us to follow Christ. Maybe some of you might say: ‘But Father, how old fashioned you are to speak about the devil in the 21st century!’ But look out because the devil is present! The devil is here… even in the 21st century! And we mustn’t be naïve, right? We must learn from the Gospel how to fight against Satan.”

Read between the lines there and he is saying Islam is satanic. 

You read between the lines and found some hate speech against Islam. I read and got to the bit where he said stuff about devils whereupon I disregarded it as fairytale drivel.

Granero IMO is one of those average players who does well in a good team. If the team is not doing well he disappears. I hope we get rid of him or if not use him in a deal for another player. I'd use him in a deal to get Ben Davis from Swansea (more spanish style) or something like that.

I haven't said anything about disliking someone based on their race or ethnicity. We're talking about making assumptions about a person based on their nationality or race, including positive assumptions.

It's funny that you talk about rudeness because for me that's one of the key characteristics about English people interacting with other cultures. English culture is so hugely non-confrontational (from ""could I please"" to ""I'm sorry but"") that generally speaking when you bump up against cultures, it's very easy to consider them rude. They may not mean to be rude, but they are being rude *by your standards*. Easy example - in China, in large cities there is almost no personal space. People bump against you, barge into you, push past you and generally act in a way that - were it to happen in the UK - would be considered appallingly rude and inappropriate. There is no universal standard for what constitutes rudeness, unfortunately.

Better example: is it racially prejudiced to dislike someone raised in a culture where sexism is rampant? If I meet a person from a country where women are denied the right to vote, or to drive a car, or to dress how they like, is it not reasonable to assume that they will echo these values? It strikes me as a more logical position to assume they do, rather than assume they're a blank slate unaffected by cultural trends.

UK culture is generally characterised by striving to be tolerant (so much as it's possible to do self-analysis like this) - I would not assume on meeting an English person that he would be racist or sexist.

They are dumped in a dorm room with hundreds of people in exactly the same situation, it's little wonder a lot go overboard. Add to that that they are usually in an unfamiliar, possibly far bigger place than they grew up in.

Unis shouldn't have to baby sit them, but actively driving them into more dangerous practices seems unhelpful, especially when it is done in the name of baby sitting them in the first place!

Maybe I feel like this because I went to a collegiate uni rather than one with just dorms. For most life very much revolves around the college and being involved in that community and there is definitely a sense of a duty of care.

Two friends hated the work loads and how it consumes your life with marking and lesson planning. They also didn't especially like the children. They both went back to uni and did PhDs.

The fourth is a bit different. She is expecting a baby and when she goes on maternity leave she isn't planning on going back to work.

Speaking as a liberal Conservative, I think the Lib Dems have, on balance, demonstrated the ability to govern. And govern in extremely difficult circumstances. Not easy for a small party who haven't been in office since the First World War.

Sadly, most of their voters are used to a party that can promise the earth (because they don't have to deliver), and can't face the reality of what real governance means (which is usually having to do things which someone, somewhere is not going to like).

Conservative and Labour voters who've been around the block a few thousand times accept that governance is, even in the best circumstances, a massive compromise.

Lib Dem voters have, up until now, been able to wallow in the smug self-righteousness of being a supporter of the 'nice' party without having to face up to the tawdry reality of running an entire country.

He started playing for U21s at the age of 15, and now at 16 is one of the most important players for both the youth team and the U21s. He has scored some incredible goals as well. Here's a good article by thechels.net on him: http://thechels.net/2013/07/the-potential-of-jeremie-boga/

Mind you, that article is from last year, and Boga has developed a lot since that time. He's actually become a very important player for Dermot Drummy in the U21s. Some of his goals from this season are included in this compilation: http://thechels.net/2014/05/academy-season-review-50-sensational-strikes/

Baker is good but he's only getting this fame after his recent goals. I remember Michael Woods getting the same amount of fame for his long range goals and everyone thought he'd turn out to be as good as Lampard. So I'm not so sure about Baker just yet. Although Woods didn't score as many goals and our academy and development methods are a lot better now. Baker has still had a great season, but I'd still put him on par with John Swift.

Well no, a tightening that had to happen because lots of unsuitable were being given mortgages who then defaulted on them. So the regulations were tightened, banks got much stricter on mortgage applications to fix that problem. I am sorry you got caught up in it, clearly it made you very angry, but can you not see that that was exactly the kind of 'fixing the system' change that you wanted.

I'm not going to continue because clearly I'm not going to change your mind. But I will reiterate, making a mistake does not equal breaking the law, no matter how catastrophic that mistake was. Most bankers are not 'criminals' (some are and I hope they are caught) they are people meddling in a very complex system who thought they were making the right decisions.

Also I think sectarian politics will continue to thrive for the foreseeable future in NI.

Of course it's easy to be affected by filter bubbles. I personally avoid Google, but just because DuckDuckGo doesn't know who I am and everything I've clicked for years doesn't mean I'm forced to search for things the challenge my views.

Many people rarely search for opinions that challenge theirs. That's not new, it's an ancient fact of life. If anything, the kids now are more aware of that than we were years ago - the web presents us with more ways to stay in our bubbles, but also more and easier ways to get out of them.

The real issue here - it's a bit daft complaining who other people vote for if you didn't bother voting yourself. The reason old people tend to get the government that suits them is because old people are more likely to vote. Of course that's a bit rich coming from me - at 43, I only just voted for the first time.

true,collinsl02,null,null,"First off, welcome to the sub and I hope, if you decide to come here, that you have a happy time here!

&gt;As I'm working on finishing my studies so I can get into a University I'm unsure what I should study for a higher degree to get a well paying job. I'm guessing something within IT, but anything specific? 

As someone in the IT field (a unix systems administrator) I would say that any degree-level field should net you a decent amount. By this I mean jobs like a unix systems administrator, or a network administrator, and that sort of thing. Whilst you can get degrees in programming or web development, I don't include those here because whilst these are specialist fields, most of the time an entry-level position in them doesn't require a degree. Now this is not to say that people in this field are stupid or less qualified, no siree not at all. But they do tend to be less well paid unless they are very good, and they get a ""senior"" or ""lead"" position. 

Without meaning for this to be an attack on you at all, I would also avoid entering the IT field unless you are passionate about it. most of the time it's a hard, high-pressure job that can eat a lot of hours in your day, even when you aren't officially at work. And, depending on what position you end up in, whilst at work you will always have a lot to do, and people will burn out fast if the job isn't for them. If you have a passion for the job, then all this will be worth it. If you don't it won't be worth it and you'll very quickly want to move on.

&gt; I've also been looking at study to be a teacher for 6-9th grade in Mathematics and English. How hard would it be for a non British citizen to get a job as a teacher?

As an EU citizen, all teaching jobs in the UK will be open to you, provided you can show the correct qualifications. This will likely (but you'd have to check) be an undergraduate degree in whatever subject you wish to teach, plus a Post Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) which is the most common way of gaining the required certificate to teach in any primary or secondary school here.

We also don't use US grades here, and the age translation range for the grades you've specified is children from the ages of 11-14, which is school year 7-10 here, which doesn't really fit into a normal pattern for teachers here - you'd likely want to be a secondary school teacher, which means you would teach children between the ages of 11 and 16, and maybe up to 18 if the school has a sixth form attached (this is post-secondary education before university, here known as A-levels or other equivalent qualifications). Plus, most secondary school teachers specialise in only one subject, due to the requirement for a degree-level education in the subject (this could of course be appropriate experience) and the fact that teaching blocks are normally worked out around specialised members of staff - you wouldn't have time to be switching between subjects. Of course, there are always exceptions to these rules, but that's up to the individual school.

&gt; I've been looking at possible places to live and have fallen in love with Gloucestershire and Cambridge. How is it to live at those places? Any better places in your opinion? (I love your brick houses and would prefer to live somewhere that's a bit more closer to nature) 

As a native of Herefordshire (one county over from Gloucestershire) I can heartily recommend living there for the atmosphere you desire - transport links with the rest of the country are decent (maybe not great), you can live somewhere rural if you choose, and there will be plenty of teaching jobs. What there won't be, however are many IT jobs that pay what an IT person is worth. The majority of entry-level IT positions are in London, or other cities like Norwich (for some strange reason there's a lot of IT jobs there), and the IT jobs in more rural areas like Gloucestershire either don't exist, or they don't pay what you're worth. That's the main reason I had to move to London - I couldn't get a job in my home county. You should have little trouble with teaching though - teachers are always in demand.

Cambridgeshire would be better for IT jobs because you could commute into London if you so chose. This might be expensive though, but there are likely to be more IT jobs in Cambridgeshire than Gloucestershire, and because they're closer to London they pay better.

&gt; I'm considering on going to Cambridge or Oxford next summer on a study trip (Those EF things) but I'm wondering if it's worth it or if I just should go on vacation? 

If you think it'll help then go for it! :-)

&gt; Any extra that you can think of that I should consider would be appreciated :)

Have a look around the internet at some of our social customs and idiosyncrasies - it's fun reading (most of the time!). A bit of history reading, if you're interested, wouldn't hurt either. Personally, I think if you can understand a country's history it's a lot easier to understand the country, but that's just me.

This would allow us to quickly attack defenses before they can be organized after a loss in possession.

Dembele is often too slow in his possession and does not look to pass forward as often as he likes to dribble forward, which is, in my opinion, less effective in the moments immediately following a change in possession.

As a work of early modern English literature it is undoubtedly magnificent, a triumph of a period when English literary culture was flourishing and the language as we know it today was becoming established and standardised with a shared canon of texts. 

Which comes to why the King James is really important. It was _the_ translation for centuries. The King James bible was read from the pulpits across England every Sunday. The language of King James was heard across the land by everybody: and this was the only book language most people ever heard. It was a standard, common to all English people. The memorable phrases and proverbs of the King James bible are everywhere in our English speech to this day. Allusions to the Bible are everywhere in our literature, and when the Bible is quoted it is the King James you'll see.

Whether the King James qualifies as strictly English literature you might debate - it was a translation, as you say, and even as such it cribbed an awful lot from Tyndale, who therefore reserves a large share of the literary credit.

I'm from Scotland and now live in Toronto, and have also driven in the US (Miami). From my experience:

- In most places you can turn right on a red light
- Lots of quieter streets will have 4 way intersections with stop signs. You give right of way to whoever arrives first, or the person to your right.
- Filling up gas (petrol) in the US (Miami) was really weird - you could only use a credit card at the pump. Mine wouldn't work for some reason. If you want to pay inside, you have to first go inside and can only pay a maximum of $20 I think. Then if you don't use all $20 you go back inside and get your change. It's really weird. I'm assuming it's to stop people stealing gas, but...I dunno. To add confusion the clerk only spoke Spanish. 
- Roads are a lot wider
- In Canada the speeds are in KPH
- Miami drivers are *easily* the worst drivers I have ever had the displeasure of encountering.
- Many US cities use very easy ""blocks"" which make them great to navigate
- I would say driving here is a little more aggressive than the UK. Toronto is, anyway (but they're generally good drivers). 
- You might want to check if you need a International Drivers Permit
- Don't spray paint ""Nascar Sucks"" on your car if you're going down South :)

The extraordinary campaign Alberto Moreno last year prompted pass within months of absolute anonymity (well known to people who know the grassroots) to become one of the most desirable pieces for the big clubs. This just down the curtain campaign has not been as good, but has enjoyed the title of the Europa League with Sevilla and now is in the ratio of players who handles Del Bosque to participate in the World Cup in Brazil, although is one that has less chance of making the cut.

This recognition has traspado the Spanish border and several clubs in the Premier League have followed him closely, to the point that your pass can be closed in the next few hours with Liverpool. The English club are willing to invest 20 million euros, missing only a fringe for the transfer becomes official. Liverpool are looking for a left back as this season has covered the post with Flanagan , who is right-handed, and Cissokho .

For now, Alberto Moreno is concentrated with the selection and tomorrow will play a friendly with Spain at the Sanchez Pizjuan, what could be his last game in which he has been home in recent years",0,1401298500,null,0,false,0,cht9jbn,t3_26i8s2,t1_cht9jbn,t3_26i8s2,null,1433991813,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

true,[deleted],null,null,"How far down the chain would you go? I mean, the system doesn't really work the same here as it does in the US; you'd probably have to have been in the Shadow Cabinet or at least on the front benches. Nowadays you need someone comfortable speaking in front of the media, and you want someone who's not done anything too dodgy because the opposition will constantly bring it up. So in the shadow cabinet you currently have:
Ed Milliband, Harriet Harman, Ed Balls, Douglas Alexander, Yvette Cooper, Sadiq Khan, Rosie Winterton, Andy Burnham, Chuka Umunna, Rachel Reeves, Tristram Hunt, Vernon Coaker, Hilary Benn, Caroline Flint, Angela Eagle, Mary Creagh, Ivan Lewis, Jim Murphy, Margaret Curran, Owen Smith, Maria Eagle, Michael Dugher, Jon Trickett, Gloria De Piero, Chris Leslie, Baroness Royall, Lord Bassam.

So out of these, most people have probably not heard of any of them after Hilary Benn. I haven't and I'd say I keep pretty up to date with politics. Harriet Harman and Ed Balls are sort of tarnished by association with the previous Labour administration. Douglas Alexander's seat could disappear if Scotland vote for independence which would be a little risky. Yvette Cooper flipped her house in the expenses scandal (along with Ed Balls who she's married to). Sadiq Khan has already said he might run to be London Mayor in 2016. Rosie Winterton, expenses. Andy Burnham  ran in the last leadership contest and didn't do very well. Chuka Umunna is probably a bit too young at the moment although he could be a frontrunner in the future (in modern politics Cameron and Blair were the youngest in a while to be elected PM and they were both 43 when elected), Rachel Reeves could be a frontrunner in the future but she was only elected in 2010 so there're a lot of others with more experience.

Basically, who would you pick? It'd be really difficult. I'm not really a Labour supporter but I'd consider voting for them if I thought they had the right candidate; someone like Alan Johnson would have been a great leader had he not left the Cabinet.",0,1401298558,null,0,false,0,cht9kco,t3_26pi1l,t1_cht9kco,t1_cht8nce,null,1433991837,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,Popeychops,lfc99,,"1) **Alberto Moreno**, if he can be had for £15m, is going to be good value cover for one of our main weaknesses, without having to blow too much of the budget.

Spend: **£15m**

2) Of the names I've seen discussed, **Gōtoku Sakai** looks to me like the most enticing piece of business for the club. The East Asian market is growing enourmously, and it's the one world market our team has never represented. Like Park Ji-Sung and Shinji Kagawa at United, he might not necessarily be the best player we could possibly land for the money, but would be worthwhile for his versatility and bringing in the Japanese national player for that position.

Sell Johnson for about £5m. Net spend: **£5m**

3) Who can fill this slot in our team sheet? **Emre Can**. It looks like the deal will be one of our first signings once the window opens. Unless he moves somewhere else it doesn't seem worth talking about alternatives. 

**£12m**

4) I'm a fan of **Xherdan Shaqiri**. Kono scored 8 in 27 starts in the Ukrainian league, while Shaqiri got 6 in 17 *in the Bundesliga*. And he's two years younger. I expect he will cost slightly more, but I think he'll have better end-product for us.

**£15m**

5) **Julian Speroni** on a free, what a shout. I don't believe it will happen though, because he won the club's POTY award. We'd have to court him pretty quickly before he signs with someone else. Are you listening, FSG?

**Total spend: £47m**

Why not shed some other dead wood (Assaidi to Stoke for £5m, Reina to Napoli for a similar amount, etc) and have a blowout on **Adam Lallana**? I expect it will be possible since our budget is rumoured to be about £60m, and it will be a marquee signing to sell shirts and keep some hype.

**CB**: I only think we'd need a CB if Vertonghen leaves, which I don't think it'll happen. If it does, Martins Indi would be a solid player that can play either at a CB or LB position, 5m-9m tag.

**AM**: Maybe we could/should add another skilled player to the team, and my favorite player for the job is Lorenzo Insigne. He'd probably cost us 15m-20m Euros, playing in the left sided of the pitch along with Eriksen and Lamela, making a amazing young midfield core. Berardi could be a option too, would cost 5m less, but he plays on the right wing most of the times.

**FW**: Lacazette and Jackson Martinez are my favorite targets here, Remy would be really good too. Lacazette has a tag around 8m-15m, the french player is a fierce dribbler and can shot from long and short range. Martinez, has a really fat price tag 27m-34m, a strong, fast player who can manage to shoot in the most difficult situations, a master of the header who's also a surprisingly good passer.",0,1401302069,null,0,false,0,chtbauw,t3_26ocdz,t1_chtbauw,t3_26ocdz,null,1433992645,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

Also, the public really doesn't like the political uncertainty, especially in times of economic crisis. It's likely many swing voters would have gone Conservative just to try and prevent another hung parliament.

This is just speculation of course.

And to be honest, there is violence in all schools - it's just it's recently led to a pupil at one school here stabbing a teacher in the neck, which unfortunately severed her jugular and she died.

There is ""violence inherent in the system"" to quote Monty Python, sadly, because when you group together school kids from different backgrounds and of different abilities (to a certain extent) there will be people who bully others because they can't or won't stand up for themselves. And if a group of children unite on the weaknesses or lack of control of a teacher, then they can attempt to bully that teacher too. Of course, this all depends on the teacher, the subject, the children, the age group, and the area in which the school is located.

Area does have a lot to do with it - if the school's catchment area (the area in which pupils are sent to this school rather than a different local one by default) covers a more deprived area (I.E. London's east end, or the housing estates of Birmingham or Manchester) then the classes are more likely to contain more pupils who have had a more deprived upbringing and who might not be as disposed towards education as, say, a school whose catchment area covers one of the richer parts of Chelsea or Islington.

I am of course speaking in generalisations here, and it is entirely possible that children from a worse-off background may wish to better themselves more than a child of a rich person, but the odds are sadly against that. 

And of course, if you have a large number of children who don't want to learn, you're more likely to have children who will actively resist being in school - normally this leads to a higher truancy rate, or the child trying at every opportunity to harass the teachers and to cause disruption, and of course there will then be a very very small subset who will occasionally attempt to attack teachers, sometime succeeding. It is extremely rare, however the figures are slightly on the increase, it would seem. It's not something to worry about day-to-day, and most of the time teachers can spot the warning signs and take corrective action early, but sometimes it just comes out of the blue.

Pros

* Housing is cheap, my rent is £260 a month I live in a really nice shared house in a really nice area of the city, you can get a studio for £500 a month, and an amazing 2 bed flat on the quayside for £1000
* Friendliest place I've lived in the UK (n.b. the USA and Canada are both friendlier).
* The best nightlife in the UK, no question, the bars and pubs and clubs are cheap, plentiful, diverse, fun and friendly - if you want to have a fun night, you're already in the best place you could be.
* Amazing transport, Metro straight to the airport, £30 for a flight to bristol, £75 for an advance return train ticket to London (2h50m)
* Taxis are so cheap they're often cheaper than buses. 
* The beaches, its a massive city and you can go surfing every evening.
* National parks on your doorstep
* Loads of history, romans and castles, its all just everywhere
* Close enough to Scotland that you can go on a weekend skiing or climbing trip to Glen Coe/Fortwilliam in the weekend without hassle the highlands are only 5 hours either way - Also only 3 hours from the Lake District or Snowdonia.
* Loads of concert venues, great art galleries etc.
* Really good restaurants, if you want to live it up and be all posh/go to fancy bars and restaurants you can
* Best place I've ever lived in the UK, 

Cons

* Noticeably cooler than London, spring is the best season, because in Summer when the pressure and temperature rises it gets a bit it kinda gets misty, which is a bit rubbish,
* Locals while friendly are quite insular, most people haven't really left the north east,
* Noticeably more poverty than other parts of the UK (probably on a par with London),
* Home games at St James kind of screw up the city centre with how busy everything gets,
* Not that diverse, if you want multiculturalism, its not as good as London

I get passionate about everything that I decide to learn more about than just the surface so I'll probably have no problem there except for pure programming. I've been looking into Bachelor of Science in Engineering in Computer Science or Master of Science in Engineering. They seem a lot of fun (can't seem to find a description in English but google translate might work to a part? http://www.kth.se/utbildning/hogskoleingenjor/datateknik ) and I do believe I would enjoy the work. I went to a computer science school but due to unfortunate circumstance wasn't able to complete enough to be able to get into a University which is why I'm studying now :)

That is quite different than here in Sweden. Here we have grade 1-5 and then grade 6-9. After that I think the equivalent would be college  which is grade 10-12. Then it's University. I'm going to have to speak to one of the Student counsellor so that I get what I need if I decide to become a teacher in the UK. But it's useful information to know so thank you :)

That's quite weird considering the times we live in. Here you can find IT jobs everywhere except for the really small communities (a few thousand if even that of inhabitants) but you wouldn't want to live in those anyway.  Would it be possible to live 30 min to an hour away with car from example Cambridge and be able to get a decent priced house?
I mean it's quite expensive to live in London so even if I get lower pay it might be worth it if everything else has a lower price as well. :)

I've done a few projects in school on UK and it's history but it's never a bad idea to brush up the knowledge :)

I think they do. Guessing here, but I'd wager that much of the most common live content would need a lot key frames anyway due to the nature of it. Any motor racing, pop concert etc is going to have a lot going on on-screen anyway, lots of cuts etc. Maybe not so important for the snooker though!

&gt; real life streams tend to just invalidate and skip ahead if they are struggling. This works just as well with TCP

Not entirely, any retries handled out-with your app in layer 4 are wasted requests. You could dick with the defaults to minimize them but at that point you're trying to ram a square peg into a round hole by making TCP behave like UDP imho.

It probably all comes down to how ""live"" you want it. If you want viewers to see the image as close as possible to reality then UDP has the edge. Ever watched live football on digital cable when a neighbour watched it on analogue broadcast? They'd be about 5-10 seconds ahead of you and it was like watching the game with a physic (assuming you can hear their yells to tell you if a shot on goal went in). The novelty wears off after about two minutes then it's just annoying. This plus things like new year count downs are a limited but real market for ""real live"" feeds. Same with whatever new interactive things are around the corner, gambling sites etc could benefit from as-near-as-possible to real time video by taking bets on penalties etc as they happen. 

Oh, one last thing, consider the poor bastards in the middle of nowhere using a satellite downlink in conjunction with analogue modem for the upstream. UDP would let them watch HD video which would be tricky otherwise with the full round trips of TCP.

That's not the degree I took personally, but I was friends with a lot of people who did, and I know the majority of them have got good IT jobs now, and they did enjoy the course. It's also a good grounding in IT - most employers at the moment expect people to have an ""IT"" degree - it doesn't matter what you specialised in, as long as you have a degree, a willingness to learn, and a passion for the work. Based on that, I think you would be well set up with that degree. :-)

&gt; That's quite weird considering the times we live in. Here you can find IT jobs everywhere except for the really small communities (a few thousand if even that of inhabitants) but you wouldn't want to live in those anyway. 

That's the thing - there are IT jobs going in the rural areas, but there are fewer of them, and they don't really pay what you should be earning for the time and training you have to go through to get the job. If you wanted to earn less, then I'm sure it would be easy to get a job in a rural area.

&gt;Would it be possible to live 30 min to an hour away with car from example Cambridge and be able to get a decent priced house? 

The problem here is that hundreds of thousands of people have had the same idea - you could live in King's Lynn, say, and commute to Cambridge every day, but what you'd save in house prices/rent you might well end up spending on travelling costs. Plus, how much is your commuting time worth to you? If you lived an hour away, and you were teaching, that would be two hours a day less you had for work at home, or for social activities, or for sleep. And if you got caught in a traffic jam you could easily wind up an hour late, which wouldn't be that good on a regular basis as a lot of roads in Britain during the rush ""hour"" (more like rush three hours now) get very congested at the best of times.

&gt; I mean it's quite expensive to live in London so even if I get lower pay it might be worth it if everything else has a lower price as well. :)

Most jobs offer a ""London Weighting"" for working in the capital, which you obviously wouldn't get if your job is outside that. However, quite a lot of the time the ""London Weighting"" doesn't match up to the actual increase in the cost of living in London, so you might be proportionally better off living outside the capital. However, this could easily have changed by the time you decide to move here, so an assessment of job offers at the time would be in order. :-)

&gt; Thank you so much for taking your time to answer so thoroughly and I'm sorry for the late answer but my shift ended and I had to get home first :)

true,MMSTINGRAY,null,null,"&gt;Law Abiding Citizens can obtain handgun 

Yeah because in every other country with legal handguns there isn't normally a rise in gun crime. You know because it's kind of like escalation, instead of threatening to punch someone, people threaten to kill someone. Instead of beating his wife, he shoots his wife. And so on. The US is the perfect example of how your argument makes no sense.

&gt;Criminals who don't obey the law anyway will continue to sue handguns

Why do you think gun crime is so rare in the UK? Even in high crime areas it is rare compared to countries with less gun control.

Also when arms are tightly controlled in the country it actually makes it harder for criminals to obtain firearms and then to use them freely. Again what do you think the reason is? Why do so many armed robbers use converted guns, replica guns, etc? If there is this easy blackmarket to obtain real guns. It doesn't exist because when nearly all guns are controlled by the police and armed forces it makes it very very hard to smuggle guns and supply them illegally. 

Also you completely ignore the fact that a lot of crimes are with legally owned guns. Sure organised criminals, etc will have illegal firearms but many crimes of passion and accidents are caused by legal firearms. The handgun that dad keeps and little timmy steals the key for where it is locked up. The husband who shoots his wife and the guy she is cheating on him with when she walks in on him.

These are real things that happen and when guns become more commonplace it raises the stakes over what can go wrong in a confrontation.

Don't get me wrong I think some firearms should be legal but not for home defence. They should be used by gamekeepers, farmers, etc. 

The only change in the law I'd like to see is some more relaxed rules over people shooting for sports, but still very strict. I definitely don't want to see ""legal handguns"" in the way they are legal in the US.

&gt;Gun crime rates increased by 77% after the ban on handguns, this because now only criminals possess the guns. It has only had a negative impact on society.

Ok I'm sure that isn't the only factor.

One massive one being gun crime suddenly includes owning a gun. A tiny perecent of gun crime is even related to an act that has injured or killed someone when guns are illegal. Also what about rules involving replicas, etc? 

And then obviously there are social issues to look at. ",0,1401307621,null,0,1401308946,0,chte4ep,t3_26oidd,t1_chte4ep,t1_chtdluu,null,1433993973,16,false,BritishSuccess,t5_2vlyo,16

His tackling is rash at best and he has a tendency to dive in, while it looks great on YouTube highlight reels when it goes right he can be caught out by it. He has been brilliant for Sevilla and Spain's U21s.

The 2 aren't really comparable to me and they're 2 players who, should they both join the clubs, will come to define the difference in play between Liverpool and Chelsea. ",0,1401307930,null,0,1401309440,0,chte9xt,t3_26pkqn,t1_chte9xt,t1_chtccbo,null,1433994046,15,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,15

Let's take an extreme example, and say that we want to poll all the species in the entire universe as to whether they like the taste of chocolate or not.  And that there are a trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion different aliens.

Now we ask only 5000 of them of them whether they like chocolate.  But we do so randomly.  Say that we found out that 30% of the sample like chocolate.

So we've polled only a tiny tiny fraction of them.  There will be trillions upon trillions of entire species that we didn't ask.  There will be whole galaxies that we didn't even look at it.

Yet our accuracy is still amazingly high - our confidence interval is just 1.3!  Meaning that we can still say that between 28.7% to 31.3% of the universe's members likes chocolate.

- For all that is holy avoid the Gardiner Expressway (highway into downtown that follows lake Ontario) during rush hour because it has some lane closures because of construction (for 2 [years!](http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/transportation/2014/04/28/7_things_to_know_about_the_gardiner_lane_closures.html)). 
- People are pretty decent drivers here
- Avoid: Rexdale, Scarborough, Parkdale, Jane and Finch, Weston Road,  Jamestown, east of Jarvis street (downtown). 
- turn right on red
- Speed limits: city 50, city roads 60, country roads 80, highway 100. You can get away with about 120 on the highway though. 
- I would avoid driving downtown during rush hour as things get hectic
- DON'T pass a streetcar when it is stopped and has it's doors open. 
- Some signals don't have turn left lights so they flash green: that's your advance turn arrow.

true,kingofeggsandwiches,null,null,"Going to an minor all boys public school, I would say behavior was far worse there than at state schools, although I'm only going on reports from friends at the time who went to state schools. Public schools are very reluctant to expel pupils because it makes them look bad, and in an all boys environment there was very much a boys will be boys attitude towards bad behavior. Amongst the pupils there was an attitude of being as thick as thieves and reporting anything to the teachers was considered betraying your fellow students, this led to a lot of fun sometimes winding up teachers with the whole class in on the jokes, doing stuff like turning a teachers desk around when they went off to get something they'd left in the staff room or throwing coins across the class whilst their back was turned. Stuff that was majorly disruptive but not really malicious. A fair bit of bullying went on in the typical way a competitive environment breeds, kids who weren't able to give as good as they got were targeted with jibes and pranks and generally had their lives made uncomfortable. 

On the other hand, the relatively frequent fights that went on were typically one on one and would be broken up by the peer group before anyone got seriously hurt. Nobody was physically bullied in the sense of a bunch of stronger kids beating up someone small and defenseless for the sheer fun of it, no one was extorted or stolen from, and nobody needed to fear for their well-being beyond being psychologically tormented. 

Then again from what I know of state schools there was a much lower tolerance for this type of mucking around. Peer groups didn't feel any obligation to cover up for each other's bad behavior. Schools run a much lower tolerance for violent or dangerous behavior, suspensions and expulsion are much more readily used as punishment. I know one school that will suspend you for fighting the first time and expel the second time no questions asked, if this had happened at my school they'd be losing kids by the dozen every year. 

However I have also heard some horror stories from some state schools, for example a colleague has a son who's being moved to his third school in a few years, at the first school he had pupils waiting for him after school to beat him up after they turned on him, after he was moved from the first one news spread and to the new school and a similar event happened this time with kids banging on his parents' car threatening to come to his house. He also had his property vandalised in school and constant threats made about how he was going to get battered outside of school. A lot of the kids doing this come from rough families who would mostly be apathetic towards or unable to prevent what their children are doing, so nothing could really be done about it.

And note that these verses are hating actual people, as opposed to expressing a hatred of an ideology - which to my mind, makes it far more serious.  (Again, ideologies don't have feelings or rights, but people do.)

Of course, The Bible also contains verses like this - though I'm not sure how many Christian preachers in the UK dwell on such verses.

So, if we're going to talk about hate-speech, let's talk about The Quran and The Bible as well.

Tourists. Tourists everywhere.

Lennon, Paulinho, Lamela, Holtby, Capoue, Townsend, Dembele, Chadli, Sigurdsson, Eriksen, Carroll, Sandro, Pritchard, Bentaleb

1/2/3: Would not get noticeable minutes in the Premier League even at a smaller club. 

Carroll (current), Pritchard (current/potential) 

4: Stable Premier League potential, and could play every week in the league albeit for a weaker side. 

Lennon, Townsend (current), Carroll (potential)

5/6: A good rotation option to have at Spurs, and would do adequately as cover for an injury or to play in certain cup tournaments. Would've been considered one of the top talents at the clubs 10 or so years back, but isn't at the level the club is aiming for. 

Capoue (current), Holtby (current), Chadli (current), Sigurdsson (current)


7: Considered to be a vital part of the first team, and should be played as often as possible; if the nature of the opposition required his certain talents. 

Dembele, Sandro, Paulinho, Lamela, Holtby (potential)

8: A star at Tottenham and a player to build the team around, or can be sold for a damn hefty fee.

Eriksen (current), Townsend (potential), Capoue (potential), Paulinho (potential)

9: Would get considerable first team action at the top top clubs.

Bentaleb (potential)

10: World class in his position, meaning he could walk into any club team's starting line-up and also has the ability to shine consistently at international level. 

Eriksen (potential), Lamela (potential)

edit: reasoning

Pritchard: Just don't think he'll make it tbh, but I'd love to be proven wrong. Wigan will be a great move for him on loan and hopefully he gets some minutes, though unlikely. The reason I don't think he'll get considerable minutes at a team lower down is because of his defensive attributes. Just don't think he has the ability to get stuck in, and defend when necessary, something lower table clubs would need. 

Carroll: had a hit and miss season with QPR, and at the age of 22 he hasn't really developed the tactical knowledge and skill to compensate for his size. Probably an unpopular opinion on this sub, but he's not exactly going to set the world alight. Either way, he'll probably get a premier league loan this season and I hope he proves me wrong but I reckon he's on a Livermore path.

Lennon: I personally feel his time is over, he hasn't developed like most people would've hoped. His crosses tend to always be overhit or lofted slowly. He's the George Lucas of football, really exciting back in the day but all of his recent instalments have been largely forgettable. Sometimes you even would like to forget they existed to have only good times to remember. His defensive work is underrated though. 

Chadli/Sig/Holtby: Don't think many people would argue here, both are great and somewhat versatile, Sig less so than Chadli. And I'm sure everyone would like to see them both really succeed, and are great to have in the squad, but as for first team options we should be looking at players above their level. The rate at which the competition is improving means top 4 is becoming harder and harder each year. Chadli and Sigurdsson are both really good players in their own right, and once again a lot can change in football. If I was asked to give a verdict on Siggy after his loan stint at Swansea he would've been higher. Hell, Paulinho was playing in the abyss of the Lithuanian league or something not too long back. 

edit: Just realised I've misread the title :( so these explanations are going to be very brief 

From what I've seen of Capoue, definitely has the potential but injury ruined his season a little bit, he never played the same after the Arsenal game, but still definitely one to watch. 

Sandro, would've been higher if not for his injuries.

Dembele, great at what he does but I don't see him going to a big big club because of his small skill set. Taking the ball forward via dribbles is fairly niche, and he does have a great tackle on him.

Townsend: whole package in terms of ability and fitness. Great pace, can run with the ball, and has a good shot... at times. If he improves on his decision making I'm sure he'll go very far.

Paulinho: If he gets goal scoring boots on he'll be great. Defends fairly well, and on his day he has it all, good passing and off the ball movement. Just think with a season or two of midfield goals he can be sold for a fair bit. The market is always healthy for a goal scoring Brazilian Lampard-esque player. Like Townsend though, iffy if he'll reach that potential. 

Eriksen/Lamela/Bentaleb are pretty much self explanatory.

Pros:
On a sunny day it's got to be one of the most beautiful cities in Europe.  Walking round on a summer evening the centre feels very 'European' almost like Spain or Italy when the weather is good.
If you like Rugby, apparently going to the matches is top entertainment (I don't)
It's compact -the centre only takes about 20 mins to walk across.
It's a 1hr 20 minute train ride to London.
On the whole people are friendly.
It's right next to some beautiful countryside. 
There are lots of places to eat out and some genuinely nice pubs.

EDIT: I forgot these guys on the Pros - they are fabulous

Cons:
It definitely has its stuffy, precious curtain-twitching side.
Accommodation is ridiculously expensive 1 bed flats in the central areas frequently advertised around 700 quid a month
At weekends it is Hen Night Central, you have to be careful to step over the pools of sick. 
It's not particularly culturally diverse
The air quality is not good in the summer. The town centre is in a basin and the pollution just sits there. Not good for asthmatics.
Trying to find somewhere to park is a major local obsession.

I'll reiterate by saying Gerrard makes good players amazing. But no player can look better than they appear thanks to better players being around them.

true,blozzerg,eng-yorkshire,"Yorkshire, tha nos.","First day there, first interview with some bloke, he spells my degree wrong on my profile thing. 'Phorensic psychology'. Cheers pal, very reassuring. 

So I get stuck in, doing my job searching, turning up on time, being polite and well dressed, no issues. But then they start getting arsey, telling me I'm not doing enough, I need to broaden my searching etc. I point out that I've spent three years stressing my arse off for a degree and I don't know what I'm even going to do with, I just want something that pays and is very close to home (attending uni involved a six hour round daily commute, this is justifiable!) so I can save up and travel a bit, have a life and figure out my future. They're wanting me to apply for things that are fucking miles away, half an hour in a car but two hours on public transport, that kind of thing. Why can't I do morning warehouse work at this shop one bus journey away? Well because it starts at 5am and the first bus isn't until ten past five, that's fucking why. 

After I'd been there just under two month, I was sent on a mandatory two day course. It was about writing CVs and cover letters, so I told them that it wasn't necessary, my formal writing is bloody brilliant (*please don't judge me on my sloppy Reddit comments*) and I've had five years of interview and application prep already. Even had practice for higher level jobs that require presentations and research etc, I know how to tailor my CV to suit what I'm applying for, just excuse me from the course and let me spend my time more effectively. 

Nah. I attend so as to not lose my dole money. The first hour she goes over what we'll be covering, and it's just all the stuff I already know, there's nothing new she would be teaching me or what I couldn't Google myself. Tailor your CV and cover letter for the job. Highlight these skills for work in this industry, highlight those skills for jobs in that industry. Don't use txt spk. Research the company beforehand. Really simple stuff. Obviously, to some people it's going to be very useful, it was a well thought out course that covered everything, I can't criticise the content at all, but forcing me (and others, no doubt) to waste a full day attending when I clearly didn't need to, that's just bollocks. 

After two hours we went to a break, and at this point I decided I was quitting, I'd catch the teacher woman and explain that it was a waste of time as it wasn't covering anything new, nothing personal etc, but I'm gonna sneak off, go home and get back to my applications. My plan was foiled when, just before the break, she said 'is anyone planning on running off?'. Some bloke across the table put his hand up, so she asked him why and he just sneered ""it's a loada shit innit, fuck this, reyt wank, am off' and he just got up and walked out with a smarmy grin, what a tosser he was.  I had my hand up, and she then turned to me and asked me why. So I explained (politely) and hoped she'd understand, say it was fair enough. But did she fuck. ""Well them, if *you're* so clever and know it all, can you tell me, *why don't you have a job then?""* I was so stunned I didn't know what to say, the tone, the way she said it in front of everyone else. I mumbled that I'd had plenty of interviews, just lack of experience at this point and I got up, walked out and cried with anger. I just walked through town sobbing, I felt like shit already and she was the glorious royal cherry turd topping on the cake. My mum picked me up because I just felt *so worthless*. I wish I'd reported her. 

A week later I got a job, felt a huge weight lifted when I signed off. They're all just a set of wankers at that place. I hate to generalise, but they are. They seem totally clueless. Whenever I spoke to someone on the phone, they'd snap and treat me like shit, but in person when they saw I was clean and well dressed and could hold a conversation and string a sentence together, they treated me like the poor poor girl, having to come in to this place with the rest of them, my condolences. Even the bouncers gave me sympathy every time they saw me, half joking, half serious is how I took it. There's definitely that kind of 'us and them' attitude in there, sure some people are doing nothing to help themselves, but that's their problem, don't judge everyone like that, give people a chance, talk to them and listen, don't just bark orders and scratch your head when they get pissed off.

Is there any city that doesn't have 'chav' (I don't really like that word) areas in it? Its certainly not worse than anywhere I've seen in that respect. Plus its pretty cheap - even the most expensive places in west bridgford don't come close to the 'best' areas of other cities in terms of cost.

I have lived in Bristol and although Clifton is beautiful and the music scene is probably better, there is a lot of it that isn't as good as Nottingham in my eyes. Especially for how pricey it is. Like I say, Clifton's great but its kind of like London in cost terms.

Liquid liner - the Maybelline gel liner that comes in the little pot with a brush

Concealer - depends if it's for undereye or spots. The Maybelline Age Rewind seems to get lots of good reviews.

Powder and blusher - The Bourgois blushers get recommended a lot (and indeed their whole range) but they're unlikely to have any. Otherwise I'm not too sure - I'd say just check out what they have.

Pro's:

Its a charming little city, with a healthy local culture scene compared to its relative small size.

Major crime is low as far as I'm aware and incidents of general bellendry are rare. Pretty friendly all round.

There's plenty of green space, including the gorgeous Williamson Park which overlooks the city and has lovely views across Morecambe Bay.

A fair bit of history surrounds the town if that's your bag, baby.

Con's:

Travel to and from the city is okay but driving a car round the city is often a nightmare. The entire city centre is contained within a big looping one way system. If coming from the North or Morecambe by car then there is only one bridge across the River Lune either direction.

The location is a bit secluded. Preston is near but is a horrible place, since Lancaster has a limited selection of shops you have to go to Manchester for choice. However the city is located close to the Lakes, so swings and roundabouts.

The night life in terms of clubs and bars is a bit naff, all very samey and generic. There are a few decent pubs though.",0,1401316103,null,0,false,0,chti3ut,t3_26pmhh,t1_chti3ut,t3_26pmhh,null,1433995918,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I've never been behind a car doing 20mph when there's a clear road in front of them, and I drive through Brighton every day to get to work. 

Everyone just does 30mph because that's a sane speed limit. 

Also, most cars are most fuel efficient at ~30mph.. Some at 20mph, but not as many as 30mph. 

Well, on the low end of the speed spectrum. For maximum fuel efficiency 55-65mph is best for almost all cars. But that's not workable in town. 

If the 20mph speed limits are an eco move, they're a dumb one. 

If they're for safety, I'd argue they're still dumb. We'd be better off investing in warning sign posts in all the main european languages. Come summer the town is full of foreigners running into traffic. It's insane.

In the UK technically when I was a victim of ""Common assault with attempt to rob"", whereby I was spat on and punched once, I was the victim of a violent crime.

However in the US only stuff like murder/manslaughter, rape, and possibly GBH would be classed as a violent crime.

I probably should have explained what I meant by my previous comment: There is A LOT of bible scripture that states actions or beliefs that we today would find disgusting and downright morally suspect. The fact that these parts of it exist leave the book to be used as a tool of hatred (as it always has and continues to be) and too easy to create misinterpretation that even contradicts the teachings of the idol of Christianity whose name it bears.

Personally I'd prefer to send him on loan to a lower level PL or high level Championship side and let him continue to develop, but it would not surprise me if he's tired of not being a permanent player somewhere and might well welcome the move.

Honest opinion- compare him to the likes of Gotze, Draxler, Meyer, Pogba, Koke, even Coutinho, etc. who are all around the same age as him and he is nowhere near that level.  ",0,1401321033,null,0,false,0,chtjzqx,t3_26qkdr,t1_chtjzqx,t1_chtjkdv,null,1433996807,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

no matter who he *belongs* to, he's not gonna get much playing time if he stays at anfield. We have Sterling Coutinho, Allen, and Hendo all rotating in his place. Lets knock it down even smaller. Coutinho and Sterling are his direct competitors. ATM, the two are competing with each other. Is suso as good as Sterling? No way (missing speed and strength and finishing). Is he as good as coutinho? I think he is, but coutinho has had a full season in the EPL getting acclimated. 

you're right, we could hold onto him. His value is never going to go down considering his talent and age. but Suso's at a stage where he needs and deserves regular playing time. If we are willing to invest in him, then the best thing for him would be to get an EPL/LaLiga loan next season. 


again, bottom line is if we were to sell him off early, we'd miss out on a potentially world class player, but we'd gain another potentially world class player in a position we desperately need. The risk that you're not accounting for is our shabby backline and premature fullback prospects.

Very non-committal and vague at times, and rang out as an attempt to placate the fans more than anything else.

I have to say it did work though, hearing him say they were building a plan on getting to Europe was exactly what I wanted to hear.

I did cringe a bit when he said top quality managers and player's agents were knocking on our door, I'm not entirely convinced that's how it works. Nor do I particularly want us to hire a manager that is knocking on doors, I want us to hire someone who is currently already doing a good job somewhere else.

Other than that, it's good to finally hear something from the board. While I'm taking a handful of salt with everything he said because it was a statement designed to lay fears to rest, it has still made me think that the board plans to continue growing the club.

The actual word maps were made through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/advanced). As the /r/MUWs bot only does this in monthly increments, a little manipulation was required on my end to get the yearly breakdown. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, etc. were removed.

That's basically the rub right there. This has been what I've wanted for a while (particularly a loan to a PL team), I'm just worried that if it's not the *right* loan then he'll start getting agitated with his situation. Clearly he wants to play for us, especially with the way the team has been improving since Brendan showed up. Whatever happens, I still think we need to wait one more season before any rash decisions are made regarding his future. If we don't sign a clear backup to Sterling or Coutinho, and we don't intend to give Luis Alberto more minutes, then I say bring Suso home for the year and see how he fares in the first team, even if it's just as a backup/cup player.

Some skepticism.  

Firstly, the graph doesn't to my mind demonstrate a worrying increase in racism.  Rather it's mostly flat with an overall slight downward trend.  According to the data people last year were no more prejudiced than before September 2001.  

Any amount of racism should concern us, but are we working ourselves into a moral panic about how bad the situation is?  [This survey](http://islamicommentary.org/2014/05/pew-anti-roma-anti-muslim-sentiments-common-in-several-eu-nations/) shows that  of European nations surveyed the UK is near the most tolerant of Jews and Muslims.  

[And here's a map showing the world's most and least racially tolerant countries.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/05/15/a-fascinating-map-of-the-worlds-most-and-least-racially-tolerant-countries/)  Again, the UK comes out as among the most tolerant. 


-------------

Predictably, The Guardian yesterday wanted to spin the data as showing a dramatic rise in racism.  In many ways The Guardian is admirable for its campaigning, but it suffers from a bias that it constantly wants to find evidence for right-wing extremism.  (And vice versa for right-wing papers.)

But good for The BBC for publishing this honest + sane article about this nonsense.

They put into effect the terms of the [Treaty of Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Union) that had been agreed on 22 July 1706, following negotiation between commissioners representing the parliaments of the two countries. The Acts joined the [Kingdom of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_England) and the [Kingdom of Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Scotland) (previously separate [states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state) with separate legislatures, but [with the same monarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_union)) into a single, united kingdom named ""[Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain)"".

Nasty is just 21, he will be able to learn from both Benny and Vinny, and in no time will be competing for a starting role.

As someone who lived and worked in London for 6 months, I'm afraid I'm inclined to agree with the title. 

It may or may not be deliberate but it's definitely happening, whitewash it or become an apologist all you want but when you can walk for five minutes straight and not witness a single white face when walking non stop through crowded streets then you know it's happening.

Which is why it bothers me big time when I see people debating on why UKIP didn't do well in London when they did well everywhere else and the top comment of the thread says something like 'because the London populace are educated and cultured.' 

No, UKIP didn't do well because London has a massive migrant population whom are much less likely to vote for a party whose main pushing point is to curb immigration. It's not rocket science.

Multiculturalism has failed this country or in this case, city.

Which, frankly, is bullshit. If he's not good enough, then he's not good enough, but at least give him the chance to fail if you think that. Our strikers have been so incredibly poor, there's just no excuse for it. If we had Cavani or Suarez or even Giroud, I might think that there was too much talent and Lukaku just wasn't going to get a shot. Instead, we had the old man who played well but never played away, Torres the worst player on our team, and Ba (who I have felt never got enough chances this year and deserved to play over Torres the whole time).

There may be pressure to play Torres because of the wage bill and his high profile, but I will be furious if next season rolls around and Torres is even 2nd choice. He's 30 now and will be 31 next season. He's past the point where we can delude ourselves and say ""he just needs another month to find his form and he'll be decent enough to make the grade"". He's only going to decline from here on out which is shocking to think that he could be any worse. He needs to sit or he needs to go, we can't let a washed up 30 year old block younger guys from getting the chances that he got at the same age to shine.

I think the main thing I disagree with is the friendliness thing. Before I moved here (I'm a southerner), lots of people said how friendly everyone up here would be. While I've not found the good folk of Newcastle to be unfriendly, I wouldn't say they are any friendlier than anywhere else that I have visited or lived. I certainly wouldn't class 'friendliness' as a perceived draw in any case.

The worst thing about living here is the weather. Not that its often cold (which it is), or that it rains a lot (which it does) but that it always seems to be blowing a gale up here. That for me is the main difference from home.

You're right about poverty though, and over the last few years there has been an alarming increase in the amount of homeless people in the city, especially around the Grey Street area. It's really horrible to see and it brings me down.

Pretty much agree with your other points, although I love seeing everyone going to St James on matchday and what not, but it's easy to understand that if you're not a big football fan then it could be annoying.

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a [script](https://github.com/rhiever/reddit-analysis) made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. The actual word maps were made through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/advanced). As the /r/MUWs bot only does this in monthly increments, a little manipulation was required on my end to get the yearly breakdown. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, etc. were removed. Numbers were also removed.

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a [script](https://github.com/rhiever/reddit-analysis) made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. The actual word maps were made through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/advanced). As the /r/MUWs bot only does this in monthly increments, a little manipulation was required on my end to get the yearly breakdown. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, etc. were removed. Numbers were also removed.

McConnell describe Islam as Satanic, Heathen and a doctrine spawned in hell.

- Robinson said that it is okay for McConnell to do this as it is the duty of Christian preachers to denounce other religions. However, McConnell did not make the the same accusations about Judaism which he also mentions in his sermon or any other religion for that matter. To McConnell it is specifically Islam that is the spawn of hell.

McConnell said he doesn't trust ALL Muslims, good or bad. 

- Robinson defends this by saying he wouldn't trust Muslims who are terrorists or follow Sharia but that he would trust them in a range of day to day specific activities. That he has to define the situations in which it would be okay to trust a Muslim is ridiclous. You can not generalise 1.5 billion people like that or be a leader of a modern, multicultural society living that way.

To me and I presume to most people given the reaction that it has generated this wreaks of bigotry and intolerance from both McConnell and Robinson.

Whenever he visits Portugal, people always ask him if he's going to play in their home country again.  He always gives a very political answer.  There was this funny exchange with a sick Benefica child, that Ronaldo could indulge him by playing for his team.

When asked about Man Utd, he would always speak respectflly and hint at the possibility of returning.

On one hand I do think Oakeshott has a point.  Nick Clegg is pretty toxic at the moment and likely will be until the election.  The party has had little success under him after the last election.

On the other hand; Oakeshott does come across as partisan and apparently has a bit of a record of interfering.  Nick Clegg arguably did several morally right things.  He also has quite strong backing.

At the end of the day though, it is isn't really about morality.  In our system (and almost all others) you can only enact what you wish if you have power and that means throwing a substantial amount of morality away.

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a [script](https://github.com/rhiever/reddit-analysis) made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. The actual word maps were made through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/advanced). As the /r/MUWs bot only does this in monthly increments, a little manipulation was required on my end to get the yearly breakdown. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, etc. were removed. Numbers were also removed.

Perhaps I'm making assumptions, but I reckon it's because the Telegraph is the most accessible right wing broadsheet, so you have people reading it who think they're billy big bollocks intellectuals, and through around phrases like 'agog in wonderment at celebrity', or 'extreme left/green axis', or 'lefties/socialist/communists' (those three words are entirely interchangeable, of course), without really knowing what they mean. Their only interaction with 'the left' is the Telegraph and the Telegraph comments section, so their view is going to be a bit skewed. 

Basically, they are the 'highly social animals, less capable of individual though, lacking in life experience, and agog in wonderment at The Telegraph comments section', the type of people they constantly mock.",0,1401329883,null,0,false,0,chtnuwu,t3_26pd5o,t1_chtnuwu,t1_chta3eh,null,1433998698,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a [script](https://github.com/rhiever/reddit-analysis) made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. The actual word maps were made through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/advanced). As the /r/MUWs bot only does this in monthly increments, a little manipulation was required on my end to get the yearly breakdown. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, etc. were removed. Numbers were also removed.

Anyway back to the point. Legally you don't have to but many employment contracts have a term which basically requires you to comply with reasonable requests. Even if it doesn't will it have an impact on your position, most likely although it won't mean dismissal, just that when you want a bit of flexibility or some overtime the answer may be no. 

I would do it, get it in writing that you'll do it for no longer than say 3 or 4 weeks and look at it as a way to earn an extra few quid for a few weeks which would probably be welcome given its coming up to summer and the holidays.

true,Bennie300,null,null,"Did not see the game, but I did see highlights and read many comments on the game. 

* Ake played left back and was perceived as playing well. Not his position as Stuivenberg (U21 coach) apparently preferred to play 2 BtoB players in midfield (van Ginkel and Ebecilio) behind the attacking midfielder Vilhena who also plays BtoB for Feyenoord. So my guess is that he wanted a lot of dynamism on midfield. Ake for me is more a guy keeping everything in check always knowing the football solution, keeping possession. He is less vertical than van Ginkel.    
* Van Ginkel was rusty. Did not play well in the first half, then improved in the second. He also had an assist for the third goal of the Netherlands.

Promes made the biggest impression on the night. Rekik, Ziyeck, Ake and Ebecilio probably belonged to the second group of performers. van Ginkel behind that as he had a better second half. 

Ake is an exciting talent. Ajax always has a big influence on the Dutch NT. They play with 1 DM and 2 half players on midfield, from young to old, throughout the academy and first team. So not a real ""10"". If Netherlands does the same under Guus Hiddink for 2016/2018, then Ake has a chance to be called up quickly. The 2 half players could be Strootman on the left and van Ginkel on the right. Players with big engines.

The single DM has to do a lot. He needs to keep things in check, always find the football solution, form a trident with the 2 CB's, but also shield them of course. He will also have to drop between the CB's at time but at the same time have some creativity forward if possible. I think this is perfection for Ake. He is a hybrid between DM and CB. He is a pass master. Very good in keeping things in check. A shape keeper par excellence. 

I have a feeling that things can move quick for him if he decides to really play first team football on a regular basis. If that goes well, he will have to compete with Nigel de Jong, Blind, Clasie, Anita and soon Ayoub if this system comes into play. Hard but doable for a guy with his talents. Hope that Chelsea gives him the chance and otherwise he must look out for a loan. He could maybe fulfill the Mikel role? van Ginkel is more a Lampard kind of player, but van Ginkel must improve his pass accuracy. Just came to me that the 4th goal of the night happened after van Ginkel's header was saved from the line. van Ginkel is also a good header of the ball with standard situations. Quite a complete player.

The actual word maps were made through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/advanced). As the /r/MUWs bot only does this in monthly increments, a little manipulation was required on my end to get the yearly breakdown. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, etc. were removed.

I'll catch some stick for putting Dembele up top but to be perfectly honest I've felt he's one of the best in the league in his position for a long time and whilst he's not had a great year I consider him the fulcrum which we should be building our team around. Whilst we haven't fully utilised his talents, I think he is the best we have and I hope we see that more in the new season. I've felt this way a long while and although Eriksen has had a great impact since coming in I don't think he's our best center midfielder, I think Dembele is. Marry me.

true,Omblae,UnionFlag,Yorkshire - Honda Hornet CB600F,"Couple of points: 

1. London is incredibly expensive - thanks to it having the highest rate of bike theft in the country, lots of cars to crash into and also due to lots of busy roads used for on-street parking. Expect to pay a significantly higher premium because of this. 

2. 125s are prime thief fodder given that they are so easily accessible without having to take a full test - this means there's a much bigger market for thieves to fence to. 

3. Generally you pay a premium for 125s as many younger riders crash them and claim on the insurance - although seeing as you're 25 this shouldn't be a problem. 

4. Your car licence makes NO DIFFERENCE to your insurance premiums. I know it sucks, but that's just the way it is! 

I'd personally say it's not worth the money at £600 a year, especially as it provides you no theft protection. As someone who doesn't live in London I can't really say whether that's the normal premium - but I'm in my early twenties on a full licence and I paid something like £400 TPFT for my hornet for my first year. I now pay something more in the region of £180 with my years no claims - so I imagine if you bite the bullet for the first year it'll drop significantly next year.

true,gomez12,null,null,"I think we might be. In fact, I often find myself becoming more intolerant and judgemental based on things I see and read every day.

I think it is due to many factors - namely our immigration policies, the media and the behaviour of immigrants themselves.

The first is the massive demographic shift happening in the UK in a very short time. Due to our immigration policies, many areas have been transformed very quickly. It's natural for people to reject sudden change and being pushed out of their comfort level. I'm sure that's not politically correct, but it's true. The Muslim population of the UK has doubled from 2% to 5% in 10 years, now comprising over 30% of the population in some areas. Not inherently a problem, but 

For a long time, talking about immigration has been taboo - immediately met with accusations of xenophobia or racism. Remember when ""multiculturalism"" was all the rage, and the government was saying it every day. I never really felt that this idea had the consent of the British people, and that it was more forced onto us than us asking for it. In my opinion, it was done too quickly without adequate consent from people who were living here before. As a whole, immigration is good for the country, and clearly needed to support our welfare state, pension system and everything else. But it's hard for working class people to accept that when they were fired and replaced by foreign workers (plus finding out that benefits are shittier than they might have believed). It's difficult for people to see immigrants as beneficial when their GP surgery is now filled with people wearing saris and bringing 5 kids with them and their local council office now has signs and forms in funny squiggly writing that they can't read. Judgemental, perhaps, but perception counts for a lot. Anybody who chooses to ignore that or write it off as pure ignorance does so at their own risk. I would cite &gt;30% vote share for UKIP as evidence of that feeling among British people. 

And yes, the immigrants themselves have not always helped their cause. Consider Polish immigrants - most people now don't have a problem with them. They fit in here, make friends, date and marry Brits, speak good English and do a variety of jobs. They also have broadly similar culture (love of beer, football, similar ideas of family etc) and therefore they have been generally accepted by the population. But immigrants from many other countries keep to themselves, live in areas populated by people from the same background, they don't date and marry Brits (many of them follow religions explicitly banning this) and many have outdated views on family, marriage, gender equality, sexuality and children. Couple that with organised rings of pedophiles, plenty of allegations of corruption in minority communities and talk of forced marriages, female genital mutilation, kidnapping, Sharia law in the UK and all sort of other shite and now you have a perfect storm to breed racism.

Multiculturalism is fine, and immigrants are beneficial to the country as a whole. But I think that changes have happened too quickly and without adequate consent or understanding of the British people. What we are seeing now is some backlash - firstly against rapidly changing demographics in local areas and secondly against political correctness and unwillingness to talk about immigration in a sensible way.

I hope we will be able to talk sensibly about immigration without going into full fledged racism but also without inaccurate accusations of racism. I mean, I'm 99% certain that I will get at least one reply or PM calling me racist (as I frequently do when I say various reasons I disapprove of Islam and the cultural practices of people from Pakistan and Bangladesh). Immigration should be something which benefits the UK, enriches our culture, improves our economy and improves our way of life. We should be willing to accept some changes as part of this. But it shouldn't be something forced onto us by guilt and frankly we shouldn't have to tolerate cultural or religious practices that do not belong in this country and we shouldn't be called racist for opposing those things.",0,1401338713,null,0,false,0,chtrlsz,t3_26qhbm,t1_chtrlsz,t3_26qhbm,null,1434000468,64,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,64

One of the risks on the cops' minds will be whether you are armed or not, so sit tight, keep your hands in sight on the wheel and don't go fishing in your pockets/glovebox until you are asked for your license, etc., and it will likely go a lot smoother.

On the plus side, I got the impression that giving tickets to drivers on foreign licenses was more hassle than many officers wanted to deal with, so you may have better luck at being let off with a warning (assuming you weren't caught doing anything too outrageous)

Matic can pass and distribute very well but that's not his best attribute, interceptions and tacking are. But he does have good vision and technique. 

Hazard is most definitely a goal scoring winger first and foremost, cutting inside on his right, dribbling a defender and shooting is his go to move. But he can certainly find a dangerous pass and assist. He has the vision and skill to play as a number 10 and he's done it several times this season.

We have quite the group of youth. I think Boga is the most promising but realistically I believe Kalas is the most promising. His game against Liverpool was fantastic, he played with such confidence.

:--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

So, total up and net up are pretty well linearly related, however, percentage wise, the order would be:

4  - 91%

9 - 87%

11 - 82%

10 - 80%

2 - 78%

3 - 77%

8 - 75%

5 - 74%

1 - 73%

7 - 65%

6 - 56%

So, they all get good approval ratings, 4 gets a big boost, as does 9 (jumping ahead of 10 and 11).  2 also made a noticeable rise.  the others mostly jostled around keeping similar positions.

**MASCARA:** I'm using Bourjois' Volume Glamour in Ultra Black. Mainly for the brush, because it's coarse and bushy but the texture of the actual mascara is thick and fairly creamy. Has wicked staying power too. Couple of coatsvof this stuff and I'm blowing people over with my peepers. Any MaxFactor mascara would also do as a good alternative.

**LINER:** Rimmel. Always and forever Rimmel. Its my HG. For coming up on 10 years I've used their Exaggerate Eyeliner. I have the Black waterproof one. Damn that felt tip applicator feels like it was just made for me. Its great at applying a big ol' flick and bold wings, can be a little cumbersome if you prefer a softer subtle look.

**CONCEALER:** I use Revlon for both concealer and foundation. I'm a pale girl, and have experimented with *most* of the foundations available in Boots. Revlon's PhotoReady range is just the side of the colour wheel for me without being too yellow. Its a little on the pricey side but I do swear by it. 

**POWDER:** No7 Pressed Powder in translucent. Goes on like a dream and has fantastic staying power.

I support multiracialism because nobody should be judged by the colour of their skin. I don't support multiculturalism because it is divisive, creating an us-and-them mentality, and not all cultural idiosyncrasies are equal or good. I don't think FGM is a valid custom in the UK for instance.

I support tolerence for people doing what they like. I do not support actively forcing other communities to celebrate what other minorities do. There's a lot of scientific literature backing up the idea that in highly diverse communities, it's a strongly positive thing to have a cultural hegemony, or at least a prominent and inclusive one.

There have been mutterings we only paid 13m upfront and could recoup quite a bit, but it'd be great to see how he goes with Poch's Bielsea-esque system. That still leaves room for another striker, somewhere in between age and price of Kane/Soldado. Personally, I think Lukaku is too expensive for us. 

New winger perhaps. If Lennon goes, I think the depth is enough to get us through. Though every team could use a konoplayanka or a tello. 

Loan out Bebtaleb and Carroll. Tommy's loan is self explanatory, but for Bentaleb I think its more ideal for a player of his age to get weekly experience and develop more confidence in his game, whilst also learning from different managers, something underrated when it comes to tactical astuteness. Even though I reckon he's proven himself to be more than capable, its probably a wiser idea to have a youngster play as often as possible.

Not that what they described was inaccurate, but they put into the public eye an amazingly unflattering account of their product. Clearly the tax advantage was worth it and they didn't think a material number of people would stop cramming the salty little over-processed disks into their faces.

Going back to Jaffa Cakes:

1.  That case gave us a legal precedent that a biscuit left out gets soft, while a cake would get hard.  (Appropriate really since biscuit is derived from French meaning twice baked. So, hard with less moisture.)

2.  Zero rating is a legacy of joining the VAT system. You can take something out of zero rating, but you can't add anything. (It's kind of like a grandfathered category.) This is why VAT is charged on sanitary towels and similar products. It's not an interesting conspiracy, or as some people like to complain that they're considered a luxury item (that argument would only matter if they were food) they're just not already exempt.",0,1401349825,null,0,false,0,chtudci,t3_26omaa,t1_chtudci,t1_cht0jhl,null,1434001777,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,intangible-tangerine,eng-Bristol,Brizzlefoshizzle,"There is a phenomenon known as 'white flight' the name is misleading as it revolves primarily around social class and economic mobility. 

When poorer immigrants first settle in to a new country they usually take whatever they can get, which is usually housing in the crowded inner cities, as they assimilate and grow more prosperous they choose to move out to the suburbs, where there's more good schools, more open green spaces, less congestion etc. 

Take Brick Lane in East London for example, in the 17th c. it was the destination of French Huguenots fleeing religious persecution,  by the 19th c. it had become the destination of Eastern European and Russian Jews also fleeing religious persecution, by this time the Huguenots had become established in trades such as weaving and were able to move away from the inner city slums and in to the new suburbs. In the 20th c. the Jewish population started to become prosperous enough to move to middle class suburbs and their place was taken by Asian immigrants, today those Asians are moving out with Somalians, Turks, Poles and a whole range of people moving in. 

There is no 'ethnic cleansing' at work here, this is about people choosing to relocate because the first thing the average person does when they get a bit richer is to move in to a more prestigious area. 

The fluidity and the nature of immigrant coming in waves is illustrated by the history of the Mosque of Brick Lane, which was previously a Jewish Synagogue and before that was a Huguenot chapel.  In fifty years time it may be a Hindu Temple or a Buddhist shrine or an evangelical church or a humanist meeting house, this is the nature of our demographic landscape, we're in a constant state of flux with each incoming group being treated with suspicion until they integrate enough to be economically secure and then they take their turn treating incomers with suspicion.

true,the_ultravixens,null,null,"A few potential counterpoints to that.  

1.  The average wage of people with a mortgage has increased significantly over the last few years.  In 1990 around 2.5% of people with mortgages earned over 50k.  Now over 40% of people with mortgages are over that threshold.  This is due in part, I think, to the fact that much larger deposits are currently required (Average first time buyer deposit is around 25% of value today, vs 10% in the early 90s).  So in London I think it's fair to reduce the mortgage amount a  bit, and up the average mortgaged Londoner's earning power.

2.  Regression to the mean happens, until it doesn't.  There's no guarantee that we'll go back to historical norms, people at the BofE are hopeful interest rates will go back to 3% over a few years, which is some way below historical averages.  If that happens then there could be a more gradual cooling of the market, with prices remaining roughly static until wages catch up, and then nobody would lose their house.  I'm sure that's what everyone would like to happen long term, since nobody gets fucked up.

&gt;

&gt;The __Heckler &amp; Koch G36__ is a [5.56×45mm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.56%C3%9745mm_NATO) [assault rifle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_rifle), designed in the early 1990s by [Heckler &amp; Koch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckler_%26_Koch) (H&amp;K) in [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany) as a replacement for the heavier [7.62mm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.62%C3%9751mm_NATO) [G3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckler_%26_Koch_G3) [battle rifle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_rifle).  It was accepted into service with the *[Bundeswehr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundeswehr)* in 1997, replacing the G3.  The G36 is [gas-operated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas-operated_reloading) and feeds from a 30-round detachable box [magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magazine_(firearm\)) or 100-round [C-Mag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_C-Mag) [drum magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_magazine).

Most people treat the voting system as a matter of agreement or disagreement.  Such effect in a politically motivated sub is especially pronounced.

The end result is a gradual shaping of the subreddit into an echo chamber of a consensus set of opinions.  When the national opinion swings contrary to the subreddit's established opinion, the voting pattern goes all crazy as it tries to correct itself to form a new consensus.  Either an embrace of the new national (reality) opinion emerges in the subreddit (virtual), or the subreddit abides with its opinion, and waits for the opinion pendulum to swing back to its side in due course.

The former is usually accompanied by a short-term grumble of the old user base, but is then quickly forgotten as the old consensus dies out and the old users migrate.  The latter is usually accompanied by the established power structure (a combination of the mods and the mass voting power of the 'old mob') enforcing the old opinion as truth.

As a trade off, you can shoot bolt action rifles that will hit targets up to 1000m away, very short carbines (just greater than 18"" I think?) in 22, 38, 44 as a surrogate for pistols, non-magazine shotguns, and a whole host of semi automatic rifles with limited magazine capacity (I think five rounds).

Alternatively, cashing out after the minimum term allows you to:

* Buy the shares and sell them immediately for an approximate 20% gain
* Move them to an ISA to keep them/diversify
* Take the amount you have saved in cash if the shares are worth less

If you don't cash out:

* You still have the shares and they are tax efficient, great if they go up
* Have all your eggs in the company basket, very bad if they go down

Either way, having both your monthly income and long-term savings entirely dependent on a single company is not a great strategy.

Going to the pub after work is a very casual way of getting to know someone outside of the work environment. I wouldn't invite people to my house or go out to dinner who I didn't know that well, but the pub is a good transitional place. 

I've asked some of the muslim guys from work if they want to go to the pub, but mostly they politely decline. A couple tried lecturing me on why people who consume alcohol are weak which was a bit over the top, but whatever.

So yeah, I think its a shame that a lot of muslims don't drink, because its an important part of socialization and integrating into a community I think.

...serious answer, I haven't seen any hard evidence to suggest that the Barnett formula would be redrawn if Scotland became independent, though it's not unthinkable because there've been frequent calls in recent years to change it as it stands.  Whether that would be to the cost or the benefit of Wales probably depends on the political climate at the time - since the Barnett formula is based on population it seems likely that any new settlement would probably follow similar lines, but there would be strong calls from Labour for any such settlement to take the needs of the Welsh into account in ways that the current formula does not.

Politically, there have been moves in recent years to give Wales more autonomy through devolution, including turning the Welsh Assembly into a proper Welsh Parliament with similar powers to the ones the Scottish Parliament has now.  I think these will probably continue irrespective of whether Scotland secedes.

I can't see Scottish independence affecting the political landscape too much.  Wales has a different sort of nationalism to Scotland - the Assembly was only initially voted for with a majority of half a percent of the population or something - so though there is now wide support for the Assembly having more powers, I don't think there'd be a massive swing to PC or anything.

true,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"I think you're mostly right but I'd say your reasoning is slightly off.

We shouldn't treat it the same way we treat Hillsborough but that's not because it wasn't our fans that died, it's because the club and community as a whole doesn't treat it the same way. There's a plaque at Anfield, and after the punishment handed out by UEFA and a handful of fans getting pretty ridiculously minor prison sentences everyone largely seems to consider the matter closed.

I think the main issue is that a lot of Juve fans definitely don't consider the matter properly closed. My uncle-in-law is actually from Turin, is a die-hard Juve fan and now lives in Liverpool having moved across, and I think that's mellowed him out a bit on the issue these days, but he certainly had a lot of animosity towards the club when he was first in the city.

To Juve fans who are maybe less directly affected by the disaster and feel less strongly, the gesture of changing the banner in honour of the 39 fans who died would be seen as a nice gesture. But to a lot of others it would be seen as a fairly hollow token, and the sentiment is more towards ""oh, so everything is OK now just because you make a pretty banner?"". While there are numerous people out there responsible for the deaths of Juve fans who never saw any punishment or anything like a fitting sentence for manslaughter, for the club and its fans to be doing anything less than asking for them to be brought to justice (especially in light of the amount of campaigning for Hillsborough) is seen as being a token gesture rather than appropriate action.

I do think we should make *some* display of recognition towards the disaster, such as the side-picture, but it should be sensitive to the issue. Stuff heavily around ""Amicizia"" is questionable, because it implies a huge amount of ""It's in the past, you forgive us now and we be friends pls?"" without any actual acceptance of our apology by Juve fans, and a lot of them find it arrogant and offensive that we've just gone and considered the clubs all kissed and made up and friends now without their consent. A lot of them have not accepted our apology any more than we accepted the one that The Sun published a few years back, and us acting and pretending like they have is insensitive.

Whatever we do should be toned down, because it's callous to come across as ""Wow look at how awesome we are making a big shiny meaningless banner in memory rather than taking proper action"". It's like people claiming they're saving the environment by driving an efficient petrol car rather than an SUV - sure that's better than nothing but you're still not actually taking proper action and inconveniencing yourself to do anything. We should do something but it should be mindful of the fact that Liverpool fans are still pretty hated by a lot of people in Turin, that many don't consider the prison sentences and UEFA sanctions true justice for what happened, and that as a club we've been pretty unsympathetic to that sentiment over the last 30 years.

&gt;

&gt;__Fox__ is a common name for many species of alert omnivorous [mammals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal) belonging to the [Canidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canidae) family. Foxes are small-to-medium-size canids (slightly smaller than a medium-size domestic [dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog)), with a flattened skull, upright triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned [snout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snout), and a long bushy [tail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail) (or *brush*).

&gt;Members of about 37 [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species) are referred to as foxes, of which only 12 species actually belong to the *[Vulpes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulpes)* genus of ""true foxes"". By far the most common and widespread species of fox is the [red fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_fox) (*Vulpes vulpes*), although various species are found on almost every [continent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continent). The presence of fox-like [carnivores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivora) all over the globe, together with their widespread reputation for cunning, has contributed to their appearance in [popular culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture) and [folklore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore) in many societies around the world (*see also [Foxes in culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxes_in_culture)*). The hunting of foxes with packs of hounds, long an established pursuit in Europe, especially the British Isles, was exported by European settlers to various parts of the New World.

VODAFONE

Calling Dodge City...
 
THE value of Britain as a tax haven for the world's biggest multinationals is revealed in Vodafone's latest,
surreal, results.

The company has never been known for generous worldwide tax payments — typically reporting a tax rate well below the average of the countries it operates in — but for the year to this March its figures show a credit — that is, a profit from tax — of £14.8bn.

The remarkable windfall is largely the accounting result of the firm ""recognising"" the future tax benefit, worth £17.4bn, of losses racked up in Luxembourg. This equates to around £70bn of losses booked in the Grand Duchy — equivalent to twice the country's entire gross domestic product — where Vodafone sells, er, no phone contracts at all. The £70bn isn't a real loss at all but the paper write-down of acquisitions, including that of German engineering company Mannesmann in 2000, for which Luxembourg's predatory tax system, somehow tolerated by the EU, gives relief.

The outcome is a tax haven into which Vodafone will ""for a significant number of years"", it says, pour profits from the UK, Germany and other countries that are struggling to fund public services in the age of austerity. The losses will mop up the profits and take billions off the company's tax bill. Last year £2.5bn was sent there, dodging more than £500m in tax. At this rate the losses will last 25 years or so. As Eye readers know, the Luxembourg company making most of this profit employed less than a single beancounter, earning $15,000 a year in a company earning profits of $2.4bn.

Until recently Britain's tax laws would have caught profits that a British multinational diverted into tax havens in this way — unless a deal could be struck with a friendly taxman. But chancellor George Osborne has neutered the relevant legislation in the name of ""competitiveness"". The specific changes that allow for Vodafone's ruse, and thus create its £17.4bn Luxembourg tax break, were forged in a Treasury/business ""monetary assets"" working group that included... Vodafone tax director (and ex-HM Revenue &amp; Customs director) John Connors!

In return for the multibillion pound tax dodging opportunity, many more multinationals will set up head offices in the UK, amounting to not much more than brass plates with directors flying in for a board meeting and a night in the West End, while companies like Vodafone that were headquartered here anyway will escape tens of billions in tax.

PS: Andy Halford, the finance director who presided over Vodafone's gargantuan tax avoidance structure and negotiated a cushy settlement over it with ex-HMRC boss Dave Hartnett, has just moved to Standard Chartered, the UK bank looking to restore its reputation after being embroiled in sanctions busting and money laundering.

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"I'm sorry, it makes perfect sense if you've bothered researching the topic of culture and religion.  If, on the other hand, you get your information from poor sources it's not my fault is it. I mean before I typed out the name you probably didn't even know who Ali Ibn Abu Talib was - because you simply lack the curiosity to go beyond your basic understanding of society. 

First of all this:

&gt;Religion and culture are intertwined - you can't just separate them from each other for your own convenience. 

Erm.. you've been doing that all the way through your posts. 


As with all religions the idea that they are static and unchanging is slightly ridiculous. As is you insistence that something is ""out of date"" which was tied up in notions of ""progress"" that you have absorbed from people around you but don't seem to understand. ""Progress"" itself is a tern that became loaded with meaning after the ""enlightenment"" and indicates a very particular view of the world. 

So this:

&gt;Islam has written down rules concerning the roles of women.

actually applies to all societies. 

Considering you're such a warrior of women's rights and gender equality here's a list of milestones:

http://www.mmu.ac.uk/equality-and-diversity/doc/gender-equality-timeline.pdf

Notice that the majority of what you consider ""progress"" and the essential nature of the society you're busy defending only occurred in the last 50 years. In fact your parents and grand parents probably lived in a world where a women's rights would be unrecognisable to you today. 

Secondly, where do you get ""900 stonings per year from""? I don't see a reputable source anywhere for that. Also the woman was horribly killed wasn't killed by state or religious sanction. She wasn't stoned either. That example is spurious, it would be like calling Rodgers an example of US culture and Randian philosophy.

Thirdly, Paksitan is a colonial creation. The people who came across from Pakistan and India were just as influenced by the Raj as they were there local culture and religion. We're talking at least 200 years of influence - from the Blasphemy laws ( which the British wrote) to the view of modesty and propriety that they absorbed. Considering the closeness of 19th century and early 20th century British culture to what you would call Abrahamic religion and that of Islam there wasn't much of a difference. Especially considering the South Asian institutions and civil codes carried over much of the colonial laws. 

Let me give you an example on women's rights, a really small one. The Indian practice of wearing a Sari was often done so without a blouse or anything under the main garment. Methodists missionaries were disturbed by this as they thought it to be immodest and instituted the blouson to be worn underneath. It became part of the dress itself. 

If you read ""Imperial Leather: Race, Gender, and Sexuality in the Colonial Contest"" By Anne McClintock you can see many many examples of how that two hundred year interaction took place. 

&gt;a court for not marrying the guy her father wanted to.

As for that , arranged marriages and ostracising children who seemed to dishonour the family was common practice in Britain too. It just took two world wars, the rise of individual rights as a norm and massive societal shifts to change that. 

Also, it seems in that story in particular the facts are still developing on whether the family consented so I'd keep an eye on it.

If you're getting your H signal then settings are correct. I do know that talkmobile slow your data usage once you reach your data limit (it's that or get a big bill for going over) but you will have to phone them to find out if that's the case. 
Sometimes network masts go down, you usually notice thus when your signal is fine then suddenly drops. This could be the case and usually this has been picked up by the networks and you just have to wait for it to be fixed.
The last option could be a damaged phone. If you've dropped it you could have damaged the antennae. This is common in IPhone as the antenna is part of the case. You often see this when two people have same sims in same phones in same location.

For liquid I use RY6 (the most tobacco like liquid I've tried) which I buy from Euro Vapez, the cheapest I've found so far (50ml for 8.99)

Here's some links to the kit I use if you're interested

[Battery](https://www.fasttech.com/products/1339001)

[Clearomizer](https://www.fasttech.com/p/1535302)

[RY6](http://www.eurovapez.com/epages/64085924.sf/en_GB/?ObjectPath=/Shops/64085924/Products/C013-0002)

Edit to add I started with this [kit](https://www.fasttech.com/p/1395604)

Then over time replaced the bits as they wore out - the clearomizers I use now have glass inserts rather than the original plastic ones which leaked eventually (some e-liquids can damage plastic). Assuming you don't drop them and break the glass they last for ages, and with the replacement coils and wicks you hardly ever need to buy any again.

Edit number 2: I also buy e-liquids from fast tech as they are cheap but they do not seem to sell ry6 - I do use them to try out other flavours cheaply though, I tend to buy my daily liquid from the uk as you usually want a quick turnaround on that as it's hard to plan consumption a month in advance (my orders from eurovapez usually turn up in 2-3 working days).

Culture however is different - different cultures *can* be superior. 

For example the English-Oxford university academia culture that has existed since the 10th century is far superior to the English-lager drinking football hooligan culture. 

Pertending that it's acceptable to enforce your wife and children to wear bin-bags with eye holes cut out is a shit culture and frankly undermines a lot of UK progress since the 60's when women had little rights- it's not even part of the religion because the Quran doesn't state that. It's a cultural import from the middle east - it has nothing to do with islamic scripture. Plenty of muslims worldwide don't employ the full length batman costume. 

However anyone pointing this out is met with accusations of racism despite the fact A) the religion doesn't neccessitate it B) It's cultural not religious as many muslims don't dress like batman C) it's not isolated to race because there exists white muslims that wear bin bags. 

I realise I've picked one cultural oddity out of a hat at random but I'd argue it's the most visibly divisive issue to groups intergrating and goes directly against a lot of western europes values in not shouting about your religion. 

The french are the most obvious example as they have liberte which is important to them as 2nd amendment is to americans which, for want of a better translation, represents a freedom from religion and aggressive secularism.

Unfortunately the only way to correct this is to rebalance the country by removing some mass further South. The most likely outcome is that Wales will have to be cast off from the English mainland, the hope is that eventually they will float into the Atlantic.

Many other options have been considered but South East England is too important as most people from London have their second homes here and if Brighton went missing then people from the East-End would have nowhere to go on Stag and Hen Nights. Removing South West England is also less desirable as this would remove the lucrative revenue stream from exporting the regionally-protected Cornish Pasties and again a large number of London-based second homes are located in this region.

As distasteful as these solutions are they remain vital in order to protect the long-term survival of the rest of the Kingdom. Failure to address the problems caused by Scotland leaving could result in the whole of Southern England being submerged.
