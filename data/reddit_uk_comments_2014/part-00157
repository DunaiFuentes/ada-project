Of course, another club could come in and bid for him like Spurs or Chelsea or someone (perhaps even United), but I don't think he'll go to a team outside the CL and I also don't think he'll go somewhere just to sit on the bench.

With him and Henderson being 26 and 24 at the start of next season, respectively, that could be the future of our midfield for the next 6-8 years. Add to that the chance to work alongside and learn from Stevie for the next couple of years at least. Half the England first team are our lads and we share many similarities to Southampton in the style of football we play and how Anglo-centric our squad has become over the last few years.  Even if we have to wait until after the World Cup, which we undoubtedly will now, hopefully being around the Liverpool lads for a few weeks this summer will make him realise how close they all are and he might want to be a part of that.

Our defense will play a high line ( I know :| ) and our midfielders will be pressing high to try and win the ball up field.

The trick with this show, and lots of other shows that are embracing the trend of getting rid of main characters, is to not attach yourself to the characters but to the writing. Robert Sheehan is a good actor, but he would not have been half as great if the writers hadn't given him some absolutely great dialogue to work with. They give dialogue that is just as good to the other wonderful actors and actresses who come on later.

So in short, stick with it. If you try it, and you can honestly say that you don't like any of the last three seasons, that's a fine opinion, but in my opinion, not watching because one actor left is silly when the writing and general atmosphere are still the same.

I was standing with a mixed group of friends, some of who were from that area and are Protestant, when the crowd started coming towards us.  Most of us moved on as we were ""hippies"" back then.  Me and one of my friends, who is Protestant, stayed were we where.  

As the crowd came over a few of them knew my mate and said hello.  They then asked me where I was from and, since from where I live it's beside a Protestant area didn't think they'd do anything, I told them.  Next thing I know I'm getting punched by about 3 of them and then hit with a bottle.  Obviously I was like ""fuck this"" and bolted, then the crowd started throwing stones, bottles and bricks at me that they had with them.  Got hit with more than a few of those, and was chased.

Can't remember much after that except ending up in Tesco telling some fella at the tills to phone the cops and him saying ""Uhhh, I'll get the manager"" while I seen the pool of blood gathering on the floor from my nose and head.

Cops arrived not too long after while I was trying to clean myself up in the bathroom.  Was a pretty lucky escape really, could have ended up worse than a broken nose and a few cuts.  Cops arrested a few people about it but that's the last I heard about it.

Also I was punched up the Whiterock Road because two fellas thought I was ""a snout"" even though it was pretty obvious I was a Catholic, with my name and which school I told them I went to.

Islam is the second largest religion in the world. It is not taking over Britain, it is simply mingling with Britain as happens when we stir the pot of the world with quick and affordable transport to exotic, prosperous or curiosity lands. So naturally we should expect Islam to become almost as big as Christianity in the UK, this isn't a threat to the UK in the slightest, whether you're religious or not, understanding religion is a key part to understanding humans both historical and present, and by understanding and respecting other world cultures while sharing and debating each other's opinions on ""right"" and ""wrong"", Britain can become Great again.

true,Chrisischan,flair8,,"Indeed you didn't, my apologies. Looking back my language choice does appear to presume you naive, and that was never my intention. In fact, it's less easy to assume such a thing from a person who's less inclined to be excited about new and exciting rather than old and stable.

But as for your question:
1 - CB. In Poch/Bielsa's system, the wingbacks play very high, in fact their heat maps are significantly higher than the two CM's ahead of the CB's. When in possession, the CB's then spread out somewhat and the two CM's fill the center and provide support moving forward if necessary. Therefore, this not only exposes the CB's since they're less reliant on their FB's, but the system yet even flaunts it because the very nature of it induces the opposition to attempt swift counterattacks in behind the diminished and advanced back line. Vertonghen is capable of working in this system, but our other three CB's at the moment are not. Vlad is not quite ready for an extended run in the Prem, and the combination leaves us exposed due to lack of verbal direction. Kaboul and Dawson are simply too slow on the turn to make up any ground on a played in runner. That right side will be attacked relentlessly with either of them there. So unfortunately, it seems, one of them will be likely to go and a replacement brought in (Lovren the most likely).

2 - LW. Chadli is an excellent option, and one I've no doubt Poch will enjoy using. But unfortunately beyond that, we're devoid of other options to play the left. Townsend is no longer a left winger, as he looks very uncomfortable in his positions there and is very predictable in his movement. He creates far more problems from the right causing defenders to backpedal and overlap, even if his shot ratio is poor. And I agree with you, with a good coach he could become a real danger, but his future is on the right. Kono does heavily prefer inverted wingers anyway.

3 - LB. I don't think Poch will bring in a first team replacement for Rose unless we get a decent offer for him, but I do think we'll bring in someone possibly familiar with Bielsa or Poch tactics to push him (Saborit at Athletico Bilbao). 

Beyond those, any other acquisitions would certainly be dependent on departures. But the first two, and the first in particular, will be likely to see immediate addressing. 



TLDR: CB, LW, LB - rest dependent on departures. Very sorry for the unnecessary dissertation. ",0,1401757451,null,0,false,0,chxo4un,t3_275dgl,t1_chxo4un,t1_chxniio,null,1434068016,-1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,-1

   To sustain a high level of performance over 4 competitions, 4 strikers is ideal - you'll, touch wood, always have another option - if you can keep a good balance and, of course, keep the players who aren't starting the 'big' games happy.

I had the fortune of attending a match in the players' family box (6-0 win over City in 2007). After what was obviously an incredible game we went to the clubhouse in the northeast corner of Stamford Bridge (outside the stadium) where all the players go after games to chill with their families. I'll give a shoutout here to my host Claudio Pizarro and his wife for hooking me and my brother up with tickets!

Anyway we're in the clubhouse and I'm going around getting players to sign my shirt, got Lamps' autograph on that neon yellow away kit! I asked him if I could get a picture with him, he said yes and my camera chose that moment to stop working! He said ""no worries"" and told me to come find him when I had fixed it, I thought I'd missed my chance, he went over to his family and I didn't want to go disturb him. He obviously realized this and came back over to me, asked me if I'd got the camera working, I had, and I got my picture with him. I really appreciated that gesture, I haven't met many famous people but he is just the most down-to-earth, friendly guy you could hope to meet. 

I'll miss watching him play in blue, but I like to think that Stamford Bridge hasn't seen the last of him, whether the rumours end up true and we get him on loan for half a season or he returns in a future coaching role, I hope to see him back one day.

This, as described, is a terrible idea.

If your grandparents were to die before the transaction is completed, then you could end up paying inheritance tax on the property you paid for. Even worse, you could end up with your parent, aunt or uncle inheriting the house you paid for!

(NB: your aunt has a stronger claim on your grandparents' estate, and challenge any will, if she's an unemployed loser, because the 1975 inheritance act shifts the burden from the state to family).

Shifting ownership of things for these sorts of reasons is a bit close to fraud for my taste - I'm not saying it definitely *is* fraud, but can you really say ""they own it"" if you've got a contract for them to return it to you? Contracts can be unwritten, but those are the ones that you can't enforce when misunderstandings happen or relationships go sour (which we all say ""will never happen"" until we've experienced it for ourselves).

true,strolls,null,null,"The first thing you should do is talk to an ""independent financial advisor"", which is marketing speak for ""self-employed mortgage salesman who's paid on commission"". The second thing you should do is talk to two more. 

If these guys are unable to help you, then maybe the next thing to do is talk to a lawyer, to see if there's some way you can structure things so that your grandparents can help you, without jeopardising your stake. Co-ownership might be viable, you might be able to have the property owned by a company, or something, and have the company jointly owned with a good shareholder agreement. I don't think this should be necessary, but you should definitely talk to a lawyer before putting your £50,000 in anyone else's name - far better to do so *before* than the necessity of lawyering up later.

Having got that last clause out the way, it looks like your £50k should be able to get you a buy-to-let mortgage.

I used to work with a ~~financial advisor~~ *mortgage salesman* a few years ago and it used to be a standard thing to get BTL mortgages for people with bad credit histories and county court judgements and all sorts. This was used for people who weren't buying to let, because BTL mortgages require a higher deposit, thus there's less risk for the lender, and the lender would accept a statuary declaration (I think) that ""I can afford to repay this"". 

You used to be able to get a no-questions-asked BTL mortgage with a 25% deposit, which is to say that your £50,000 would get you a £200,000 house. It was mostly before the crash that I used to work with this bloke, so I don't know how much things have changed, but a glance at Google suggests this might well still be the case.

Personally, with the guv of the BoE talking recently about the potential for market corrections, I would think about this carefully. Right now, I would be comfortable buying a 2 or 3 bedroom place (don't know if your money will stretch that far in BN1) and renting out the other bedrooms to fellow students. You'll have to put up with their dirty washing up, but they'll pay your mortgage for you.

When talking to ~~mortgage salesmen~~ *independent financial advisors* you will find them very friendly and helpful. You'll phone them initially just for a chat, and wondering if they can give you any advice, the next thing you know they'll be inviting you in for coffee or offering to pop over and see you. They will likely be personable and accommodating, and when you part ways they will have all the details they need from you to produce reasonable estimates of what mortgages they can offer you. They will then send you a letter of ""advice"", listing 3 or 4 mortgages and explaining how the one which pays them the most commission is coincidentally the one that meets your needs best. They will follow this letter up with a phonecall, and that's them really in sales mode - that's when you tell them, ""well, actually, I spoke to some other financial advisors, too, and I'm really just shopping around at this stage"".

Bi-Gender is an identity that falls under the genderqueer umbrella, genderqueer being someone who doesn't identify within gender binary, gender binary being strictly male or strictly female.

People who identify as such typically use gender neutral pronouns (such as they) but it's always best to ask about pronouns if you're unsure.

true,Evsie,eng-westmidlands,West Midlands,"It's not the only thing that's watched at all - the bigger picture, I guess, is that it's only the politics geeks like me who do watch the hearings and the smaller debates etc. 

My grandfather was an MP, and a bit of a diarist, please indulge me while I quote from his Christmas Card of 1947. 
         
&gt;Foreign Affairs and Economics - the troublesome twins of our times - never fail to command a full House when Paliament has them on parade.
             
&gt;On such occasions there is no confusion in my mind. I am not the member for Oklahoma, or Tel-Aviv. I am the political representative of 59,000 sturdy, hard-working, Black Country folk. A people whose character and tradition testify to the greatness of their past; the tremendous potentialities of their future.

 &gt;***There is no need for despondency in our present plight, nor need we lack faith in the future. We did not look important in 1940. What mattered then was not what we looked like, but what we were. What matters today, is what we are, what we believe in.***

&gt;During the past eighteen months I have been in fourteen countries, and everywhere found heartening evidence of the high respect in which British people are held.

&gt;For hundreds of years Britain has been a laboratory of social experiments and today, the free world watches anxiously the forging and testing of yet another, this time the greatest of all experiments: the abolition of want, without at the same time destroying liberty. WE SHALL NOT FAIL. 

Could you imagine one of the current crop of MPs thinking in those terms? In terms of service to their constituents above all and the belief that it is their actions which mattered more than their appearance? 

I do watch some hearings, and I know what parliament is about as well as most - and it's not all PMQs and silliness, there are some people genuinely trying to make a difference. PMQs is the public face of parliament. It's the most watched parliamentary debate every week and they act in a manner which is not, *in any way*, suitable for the institution in which they work. 

We deserve better. 

Everyone I speak to who knows him tells me that Ed Balls is a seriously bright guy with a deep understanding of the nuances of economics, the public do not see that side of him, we see the pantomime clown. 

Could you imagine for a moment if labour dumped Ed (please, God!) and put an actual statesman in his place. Someone who approached PMQs with the idea that it is a chance for the opposition to question the Prime Minister about the issues of the day, rather than it being a chance for a soundbyte and a mob? It may take the media a few weeks to catch up, but Cameron would just look fucking stupid if he didn't respond in kind. 

Then where would we be, two of our nations leaders debating and discussing important matters in a nuanced and sensible manner. 

Even ctte hearings are becoming increasingly politicised. Calling ""the bankers"" before the PAC was a farce, everyone in the room knew they had no power to *do* anything, so the MPs blustered and the bankers evaded and we all went back to sleep.

As a disclaimer, I'd like to add that I work in the industry, and I largely believe the guy above.  To summarise his points:

1)  In the period 95-2005 for the cost of about $1.5 trillion we increased global production by about 10 million barrels per day.  In the intervening decade, at the cost of about $4.5 trillion, we have managed to keep global oil supply roughly stable.

2)  Cost of extracting oil is rising at roughly 10% annually.  Cost of extracting a barrel has increased by about a factor of 5 since the year 2000, and this will likely continue.  The industry needs prices per barrel above $100 long term, and this will continue to rise.

3)  Most of the extra production that's come on stream since about 2000 is from unconventionals, like tar sands etc.  This stuff is more expensive, pollutes more and is much less energy efficient (takes much more energy to extract 1 barrel of oil than from a normal play.  This an important measure).  Energy yields from oil production will decline, even if oil production stays the same or rises, since we are extracting harder to get oil.

4)  China is outbidding the EU and US for the oil that there is, and will likely continue to do so.  EU decline is probably linked to excess Chinese, although recently china appears to have slowed down a little bit and pulled out of oil markets.  This likely explains the UK growth earlier this year, as we took on extra oil and upped production.

5)  2005 seems to have been a 'swing year', and was probably the year that kickstarted the recession.  Peak car ownership and peak miles driven occured in the US at that time, and have been falling since.

All of these factors are extremely worrying.  The cost of energy and of food is directly proportional to the cost of oil.  The cost of oil is going nowhere but up, and is probably going to come close to doubling over the next decade or so, with likely significant economic repercussions.  Bills will do nothing but get bigger and I expect quality of life to decline or remain stagnant over the next 20-30 years.  I mean energy is the economy, it's our food chain, it keeps us warm.  And we're going to have less of it soon and we're fucking horribly ill prepared..  I'm deeply worried.

true,JoelDalais,,IBWT,"Hi there,

Various sites that can teach you more about Bitcoin. It helps to have someone you can ask questions of when you get stuck, so  you should post questions back to this subreddit if you do get stuck with certain concepts.

Some sites for learning;

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org)

[Udemy, Bitcoin Education Project](https://www.udemy.com/bitcoin-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-crypto/#/)

[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/search?page_search_query=bitcoin)

There are also a good few wallet sites (so you don't have to spend xxx hours/days downloading the blockchain)

Blockchain.info

Coinbase.com

Greenaddress.it (a recent one I found with pretty nice facebook login/access, nice and fast to signup).

(just to name a few, there are others out there, and most exchanges can be used as 'wallet holders')

I will drop in a link to IBWT of course (an exchange I work for).
Low volume/traffic, but faster than sending money internationally, cheaper, and far less verification required (if you're only buying), this is achieved via hard currency deposit/withdrawal (via Royal mail), which admittedly is not for everyone (Royal Mail do really help with advice if you're uncomfortable sending money through the post). 

Only an email to register your account is needed if you are only buying bitcoin (or other Cryptocurrency), an address (or bank account details) is needed if you are withdrawing from IBWT.

Always remember security, don't store all your bitcoins in one place, and store the majority of what you get offline.

We have an enforced 2fa (email timed out password) and optional 3fa (google authenticator, which can be activated via your settings when logged in). I know the 2fa can be time consuming (or annoying) for some, but we're a little bit anal about security of customers funds.

true,apr400,null,null,"The problem at least in that respect, and IMHO, is the artificial manipulation of the housing market in London. At the moment the only reason that London functions is the insane levels of subsidisation for people who otherwise couldn't afford to live there - which keeps rents high and allows the city to keep going, whilst diverting huge swathes of tax money to a small number of already wealthy private landlords, and to the banks (via help to buy schemes), or encouraging absentee owners through tax breaks, and reducing the majority's standard of living. 

Whilst harsh in the short term it would be better in the long term to stop things like London weighting on salaries, enhanced London housing benefit etc. This would doubtless have some horrid consequences, driving people out of London or in to penurary, in the beginning, but within a decade or less things would start to normalise. London would not be able to operate without nurses, teachers, cleaners, bin men etc, etc, and either living costs would fall or (preferably) jobs would move to other areas. It is by no means normal in other European countries to have one city outweighing the rest of the country by such a large extent, and this has led to significant oddities - for instance the London area is amongst the highest population density in Europe whilst the rest of the country is much lower on the league table.

is no. There are significant risks in moving large amounts of money through a third party, no matter who it is. It turns some things into business arrangements (so different tax) and typically puts someone else in control over something you're expecting to own. At worst, it may count as some form of fraud.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"There are several problems with this really;

* In principle the EC is probably right. However, if you look at who owns the valuable property it's almost entirely old pensioners/those approaching pension age. Although they are ""asset rich"" in things like property, they are often cash poor. Even adding an extra £1000 on their council tax bill per year could be enough to push some pensioners out of their homes, or more dangerously - out of food. Furthermore, what disposable income they have tends to end up back in the economy anyway - either through the ""bank of grandma"" or by paying for things like care services. There is simply no way a conservative government is going to introduce such a universally disliked measure as this, considering their background with the poll tax, and especially when it targets pensioners (one of their main voting groups). 

* I don't think the ECs analysis of help to buy is necessarily correct. The most recent evidence shows that Help To Buy has in the majority of cases (something like 80%) helped first time buyers secure property, predominantly in the under-active northeast of England. The only impact it may be having on the wider market is by providing ""government backed confidence"" and that probably has a limited impact. **All the evidence says the problems with the UK market are almost entirely due to inadequate supply**... and on that they are correct, the UK government needs to start building homes, and not 5,000 of them in Garden cities... they need to start building hundreds of thousands of them... annually for a number of years. 

* Because of regional disparities in the market, it would probably need government recognition of the significant regional price divide. For example, if the threshold for higher-higher rate tax banding was set at £250,000, almost every property in the South-East would pay it, whilst probably only around a half would pay it in the North east. If it were set at £500,000 many properties in London would be paying it - whilst an identical building in Manchester would not. It would only serve to squeeze the already squeezed ""middle south-east"". That isn't going to help the conservatives win votes in their heartland.

If a new owner came in and dramatically upscaled our revenue (commercial deals, sponsorships, business partnerships etc), we could in theory sign 30-40m players on 5-6 year contracts to offset the value in the accounts (via amortisation).

It's unlikely, but not as farfetched as one might think. Man City's revenue has skyrocketed since they were bought out by Sheikh Mansour et al.

This is also why, if we're linked to guys with rich and powerful friends/associates -- no matter how much we don't like them -- it's ***probably*** a good thing.

true,apr400,null,null,"I agree entirely - although I would say that this problem pre-dates the recent influx of new foreign wealth by several decades at least. 

It is not my contention that it would be right and proper to price indigenous Londoners out of London. The problem is that the moment you introduce this type of subsidy you make things worse. Employers pay less than a living wage and allow the tax payer to pick up the difference, landlords profiteer, etc, etc. 

Either we should have a command economy or a market economy. The moment you mix the two the potential for abuse increases. We are supposedly a market economy but in practise this does not exist in London - to all intents and purposes companies (landlords etc) are the ones that actually receive the subsidy - either because they can pay low wages, or charge high rents. The subsidy money may go to the poor - but it passes through their hands pretty quickly, and someone receiving (number plucked from air) £10k of housing benefit in London is no better off (and probably worse off) than someone on the same wage (or somewhat lower) in Birmingham, Manchester, Edinburgh etc. 

The solution to this would have been never to have started subsidising in the first place - that way companies would have had to have either paid an appropriate wage, or move somewhere else in the country with cheaper living costs/labour. Unfortunately we don't have a time machine and so it is pretty difficult to unravel this Gordian knot. Either we carry on as now - in which case expect things to get ever worse a little bit at a time as the counterweight of London distorts an ever larger area around the city (I know people that commute to London from Birmingham - that's insane), or we reintroduce true market conditions and endure a major reset which will cause havoc in the short term. There are some other approaches for sure - for instance impose a living wage and socialise all government subsidised housing on a non-profit basis - it would alleviate some of the problem but not all and would introduce new (or indeed old) problems (eg sink estates). It would take also a very long time to make any real difference, leaving it to the vagaries of political mood swings.

 - Wait a day.  Your pounds will arrive at the exchange as Euros, after having been suitably skimmed by your bank (typically they give you 2% less than the real exchange rate).

 - Log in to the exchange -- post a BUY order to turn your Euro balance into a Bitcoin balance.

 - Use the ""withdraw"" feature of the exchange.  Enter the address that Multibit gave you.

The Prime Minister is responsible for advising the monarch on ecclesiastical appointments - essentially this is naming new bishops in the CofE and having the Queen rubberstamp them. Quite apart from the disconcerting notion (at least from the CofE point of view, humorous perhaps from the other) of having a Roman Catholic appointing the bishops of their historical religious arch opponents, Catholics are also legally prohibited from doing this exact thing under the Roman Catholic Relief Act of 1829 which had allowed Catholics to sit in Parliament again:

&gt; It shall not be lawful for any person professing the Roman Catholic religion directly or indirectly to advise his Majesty, or any person or persons holding or exercising the office of guardians of the United Kingdom, or of regent of the United Kingdom, under whatever name, style, or title such office may be constituted, [F1or the lord lieutenant of Ireland], touching or concerning the appointment to or disposal of any office or preferment in the [F2Church of England], or in the Church of Scotland; and if any such person shall offend in the premises he shall, being thereof convicted by due course of law, be deemed guilty of a high misdemeanor, and disabled for ever from holding any office, civil or military, under the Crown.

There is a similar prohibition of Jews doing this also, although Disraeli was able to get around this by having been baptised in the Church of England as a child.

So, while it can be claimed that there is no actual prohibition on a Catholic becoming Prime Minister, it creates a legal mess where they would not be able to conduct the business of a Prime Minister. I am sure that if there was any serious prospect of a Catholic becoming Prime Minister this mess could be sorted out, probably by taking these duties away from the Prime Minister and given to another member of the government until such time as disestablishment will no doubt occur. However, I personally feel that there is no serious prospect of a Catholic being elected and people seem generally happy with the convention of not having a Catholic Prime Minister.

It also creates a very large problem for the potential Prime Minister, one that Blair was no doubt happy to avoid, in that they would either have to commit political suicide by following Catholic teaching in their politics or openly go against the teaching of their religion. It's the same problem that many politicians face, and obviously most of them will often vote against their conscience to represent their voters and stick to party lines, but the scrutiny and pressure of the higher office would make it a lot harder to bear I am sure.

There's no question of whether we can *afford* £25m, but every single purchase you make will always have an opportunity cost. We don't have an infinite pool of money, both due to our owners and also to FFP regulations. If we spend £25m on Lallana that's £25m we can't spend on another player of similar value.

Not caring about money and how much is too much is stupid. If we buy a £15m player for £25m then that's obviously less value to the squad than buying both a £15m and a £10m player for their actual values. We're not going to be spending more than £50-60m this transfer window because financially we can't unless we can raise serious money from selling first-team players like Henderson or Suarez. And I'd personally we didn't spend almost half of our entire summer budget on Lallana, especially if players like Fabregas are supposedly on offer for similar money.

Which will probably answer most of your questions, but in short:

* easy to find launderettes - they're all over the place, in London anyway. Internet access, I tether my phone (on 3 - unlimited data for £15 a month) or use BT Wifi when that's around. It's not especially fast so if you're a serious internet user then you're a little bit limited.

* Easy to find places to moor up - in London, there's tons of visitor moorings or you just pull up anywhere along the tow path that there are mooring rings or grass, which I just hammer a mooring pin into. Super easy!

* The license depends on the length of your boat but mine (a 53 foot boat) costs around 700 a year. Diesel - I've paid about £80 in the last 8 months in diesel, I've replaced one gas cyclinder (at £23) in 4 months and I haven't bought any coal in months. I was donated a load of wooden palettes so just burn those for fuel at the moment but it's warm out anyway so rarely get the fire going at this time of year. During the winter, I go through 3 or 4 bags of coal a month at £12 a bag.

So, winter - more expensive to live but not that expensive, summer - cheap as chips! I'll pay perhaps £100 in fuel costs between April and September.

As a longer bit of thought, in the Labour Party rule book in Chapter 2, Clause 1, point 3 section C tells us that us one of the requirements of membership is that individuals:
&gt; are not members of political parties or organisations ancillary or subsidiary thereto declared by party conference or by the NEC in
pursuance of party conference decisions to be ineligible for affiliation to the party

I suspect membership of UKIP, for example, would render you unable to also hold membership in the Labour Party.

A quick skim of UNISON's rulebook tells us that
&gt; A member of a political party or organisation, whose constitution, aims or objectives is/are expressly or impliedly contrary to the equality objectives of UNISON set out in Rules A.3 and/or B1.2 and/or
B1.3 of the UNISON Rule Book, shall not be eligible for membership of the Union. This specifically includes the British National Party, the National Front and similar parties or organisations as decided
from time to time by the National Executive Council.

So it would appear to be possible to be a UKIP member, and also a member of UNISON.  Which would potentially entitle you, assuming you didn't opt out of the political levy, to an affiliate vote in the Labour Party leadership I think?

I agree it's unlikely that many supporters of other parties would bother to exercise an affiliate vote within Labour's leadership elections (which would also explain the affiliate vote being a couple of hundred thousand rather than a couple of million) - but that's why I feel there's a difference between Labour Party members, and affiliate members. Linked, but not identical.

If this is still in force and would really have the effect of excluding Catholics (and other religious groups) from becoming Prime Minister, surely it would be trivial to challenge under the Human Rights Act/the ECHR?

&gt; I am sure that if there was any serious prospect of a Catholic becoming Prime Minister this mess could be sorted out, probably by taking these duties away from the Prime Minister and given to another member of the government until such time as disestablishment will no doubt occur.

This actually sounds pretty similar to how some of the Lord Chancellor's responsibilities were given to other people when it was decided that the position should be held by a member of the Commons rather than the Lords.

&gt; However, I personally feel that there is no serious prospect of a Catholic being elected

I don't think that's really true.  Current Catholic MPs include Iain Duncan Smith (former Tory leader), Charles Kennedy (former Lib Dem leader), Andy Burnham (former Labour leadership candidate), and Patrick McLoughlin (current Secretary of State for Transport).  We've come fairly close to having a Catholic prime minister, and it's not hard to see that happening again.

Catholic politicians do this all the time (in the UK and other countries).

You cannot seriously believe a pre-requisite of prime ministerial candidacy is to know how to 'look after' 60m people in the way you are describing?

The civil service &amp; other permanent government organisations run everything. They provide almost all the information on which a politician will make a decision, and generally ensure the decision made is the one they wanted in the first place.

A prime minister can, up to a point, shape and influence policy, but at that level the full-time job becomes keeping their own ministers in line, without that support they are utterly impotent.

If the desire for power got them there, then the all consuming desire would be to stay there by making the right decision for their career, not necessarily the country, it's why day in and day out we read about baffling, craven examples of ignoring specialist advice when deciding policy.

The OP question is an interesting one for sure, but your arguments in favour of politicians on the basis of experience are I'm afraid nonsensical when you look at what we've actually got, and hence the idea of empowering someone to make the right decision, not just the popular one, comes down to a lot more than just the kind of CV you're alluding to.",0,1401794455,null,0,false,0,chxyktl,t3_273hbz,t1_chxyktl,t1_chxyd38,null,1434073080,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I think FSG has just been cautious/wary about transfers since the Andy Carroll, Stewart Downing, Charlie Adam moves but maybe now this Lambert transfer does signal a shift away from that caution and perhaps FSG are ready to loosen the purse strings a bit

Hopefully this summer represents Rodgers establishing himself as ""The Manager"" in the eyes of FSG for the foreseeable future. With that there would be more control over who we sign, but I don't think the caveats of looking for shining gems will be removed. But part of what makes FSG's vision for the club so great is that it can be achieved with young attacking players who fit the moneyball model.

It's a trade off. 

So in London and the South East you have much better public transport, but in the North owning a car is pretty easy. You'll probably even have a driveway to park your car in! Plus insuring it will likely be cheaper too due to less crime. If you're living far away from people, you're also living far away from criminals. 

The wages are generally less, but so is.. Well... Everything. Food, cars, housing.. Everything is less. On minimum wage in the North you can afford to rent a one bed flat. In the South East you're lucky to get a room in a shared house. 

London is pretty great, and I'd live there without a doubt if I was wealthy. But if I was just a middle income earner I probably wouldn't bother.

My reasoning was simply that with the position of the PM everything would be magnified a hundredfold. It is fairly easy for an MP to slip by under the radar, but can you imagine the position of a Catholic Prime Minister in the position, for example, of legalising gay marriage? 

I also feel that while IDS could have got away with it, the political atmosphere has changed a lot, even in 10 years. I think the growth of the gutter press has put a lot more scrutiny of the personal lives of PMs and potential PMs, and religious issues have come to the fore a lot more recently as well. The criticism that the Catholic Church has faced in the last few years has been immense and, along with a greater skepticism and antipathy to religion in general, there is a broad animosity towards Catholicism and Catholics at the moment.

Several overwhelmingly Catholic countries have done so.  President Cristina Kirchner of Argentina is a Catholic and played a big role in its legalisation there.  Enda Kenny supports same-sex marriage and Ireland is about to hold a referendum on it.  Malta has just made some huge strides forward on LGBT rights (even becoming one of very few countries to write equal treatment under the law for LGBT people into its constitution), and the current President and Prime Minister are apparently both Catholics.  There's also Anthony Kennedy, a Catholic US Supreme Court judge who wrote all of the main gay rights rulings the US has had so far (Romer v Evans, Lawrence v Texas, and US v Windsor).

true,[deleted],null,null,"Yeah you're right. The only reason it was worth getting solar electric for a while was because the government was essentially subsidising it. The cost of making a photovoltaic panel is more than what you could get out of it through electricity (especially in the UK). 


Solar thermal panels however essentially preheat the water for heating your home and the hot water that comes out of your tap. On a sunny day it might be enough on it's own to cover all of your hot water needs. Typically though it just preheats the water, but this still saves the amount of gas you will use. If you have a large south facing roof, I would definitely suggest solar thermal panels over solar electric.

Ultimately, the rents are set by supply and demand, the prices are also set by supply and demand.

If more people want to live in an area than there is supply of houses for sale or rent, it doesn't change the fact they are being outbid by others who have more demand.

It is very true that they can profit greatly from the incredible rises in both house prices and rents we've seen, but that does not in any way make them responsible for driving these rents up.

The area where I live in London, rents have risen highly, because quite simply there are more people wanting to live there than ever before, internal (domestic) migration, immigration and above replacement rate births contribute to this.  Meanwhile, new residential accommodation hasn't been forthcoming.  People don't want to loose what green space we have.  We've also not had any significant transport improvements letting people live further away.

Putting more tax on the landlords might well generate more money for the treasury, but it wouldn't result in any lower rents.  Myself I'm in favour of a good land value tax system, the only way this would result in lower rents is if it forced people to get better utilisation of the land they occupy.

WTF are you talking about? Politics was partisan back in the days when we had Maggie on one side of the chamber and Michael Foot on the other.

Nowadays we simply get to choose between two shades of popularism. If anything, mainstream politics in this country suffers from a lack of partisanship - we get politicians without ideology who chase soundbites and campaign money, instead of real solutions. They oppose policies simply because the other side proposed them, or because ministers want to boost their own profile by being seen to drive change, not people who take serious time and effort to understand a problem and fight for long term solutions.",0,1401798154,null,0,false,0,chxzesv,t3_275dqr,t1_chxzesv,t1_chxkk0i,null,1434073446,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Welbeck wants to leave United, he won't be crazy expensive, and I can see him wanting to come here with Cleverley (which I'm convinced will happen: Bobby's the only person in England who thinks highly of him and therefore we, the Toffeemen, will give him a chance). Batshuayi has blocked a transfer to Swansea although a bid had been accepted - could we attract him with guaranteed higher league position and European football (albeit Europa)? I reckon we might. At any rate, we ought to try and get him. He looks excellent, is young, and would be cheap - Swansea were set to pay **£2.5m** for him. Peanuts! 

Of the strikers we've been linked with - Lasogga of Hertha Berlin, Bacca of Sevilla, Niang of AC Milan, Emenike of Fenebahce - all but Niang I think are perfectly possible and desirable: good goal rates in good leagues, single-figure fees proposed, none older than 27.

&gt; The quotations on this page by Mr Gallon never left his lips at any point. He was 'interviewed' on the phone by a 'journalist' from the Telegraph and Argus, where they asked him a single question, and he explained that he made no such racial slur against anyone. The article was published regardless.

&gt; Mr Chowdhury did indeed get Ben a job, which was undoubtedly a nice thing for him to do, but as it turns out it was all a scheme to further his own image, as we see here.

However, you'd be paying income tax on any amount paid off the mortgage as you receive the rent. You also seem to be assuming that you won't sell until the mortgage is paid off, so I'm not sure how you plan to split the proceeds if you sell sooner.

Say you buy for £100k with a £90k mortgage, and sell for £100k after paying off £20k of the mortgage (plus the interest). There's no CGT to pay, but you'll have paid £4k income tax on the £20k that your sister paid you towards the mortgage capital. After paying off the mortgage you have £30k left, how do you share that?

If instead you repay the whole mortgage before selling for £100k, there's still no CGT but you've paid £18k income tax on the £90k that went to pay off the mortgage. If you keep £55k and gift £45k to your sister, you've made £27k profit after tax but your sister has effectively paid £45k to borrow the £10k from you, with the missing £18k being your tax.

Now suppose you sell for £150k after paying off the mortgage, making a £50k profit. You're liable for CGT on that £50k, which will cost you just under £11k if you're already a higher rate taxpayer, or a bit less if you have some basic rate band left to use. You've also paid £18k income tax again. You gift £70k to your sister and keep £51k profit for yourself after taxes.

If the lender would allow it, you may be better off lending the £10k to your sister and acting as a guarantor on the mortgage. Then she'd be paying the mortgage directly and it doesn't count as rental income for you. She'd also have no CGT to pay on any increase in value and could gift any amount you agree on to you after selling. The catch here would be that HMRC might argue that anything you received above the original £10k wasn't a gift, but interest on the loan of £10k and therefore taxable income for you.",0,1401801275,null,0,false,0,chy0aup,t3_273q5u,t1_chy0aup,t3_273q5u,null,1434073873,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

The fact is, that it's typically cheaper to build your own house (or pay for someone else to build it for you) than it is to buy it ready-built. That's not true in the UK, solely because of the planning rules, which make it effectively impossible to purchase land, obtain planning permission, then build on it.

In the UK, you have three choices:

1. Buy land. Gamble on getting planning permission, and maybe getting a reasonable-value home, or maybe having to sell the land at a loss and starting again. (Good luck getting a mortgage with this option.)

2. Buy land that already has planning permission. The ""planning permission premium"" makes this so expensive that it's a waste of time.

3. Let some property developer jump through the planning hoops, and build a ready-built house for you. Fund their profits by paying over the odds, and accepting the shoddy crap that they've built for you.

Unless you are already quite well off, #1 is simply not an option in the UK.

true,collinsl02,null,null,"Overground or overland means a train service that is run and operated predominantly on the surface in the suburbs. It does not mean ""national rail"" or trains to other cities as the overground service is run by Transport for London, who also run the buses, tubes, and bike hire around the city, amongst other things.

Transport in London is expensive compared to most places. Not only does the UK have the highest rail costs for passengers in Europe generally (outside London) the cost of travel within the capital is also high. This is partly due to the number of staff on the network - The London Underground has at least two people per station on duty whilst it's open, and one throughout the night to supervise maintenance, repairs etc, and maybe more staff at rush hour etc, whereas other metro systems in the world are unmanned or don't have the number of staff that LU has.

Another reason for the high cost is that the underground was severely under-maintained in the 60s, 70s and 80s, and now it's falling apart in a lot of places. So we have increased prices to pay for the work, and lots of weekend closures to replace track that won't last another year without being replaced.

I live in zone 4 on the zoning system LU uses (think concentric circles surrounding the city, with zone 1 being ""downtown"" and the zones extending out to about zone 5 or 6 for the very outside of London, with the furthest out zone being zone 9, which is the zone for Amersham, outside the M25 where the Metropolitan line terminates. For travel on a year pass for zones 1-4 (I can go anywhere in any of these zones as many times as I like on this pass) I pay about £1800.

However WWE did something with his storyline I'd never seen done before, they used subtlety. For you for weeks the stable had been doing bad stuff and you could see it weighing on Batista. He wouldn't actively protest, but just not fully participate and you can see it in his face that he didn't approve of the goings on. This led up to an awesome traitorous moment when he turned on the stable and helped the good guys.

From there they tried to make him a star wrestler and even gave him the championship belt for awhile, but honestly he didn't really have the charisma to be a big face of wrestling and sadly he faded back into obscurity soon after.",0,1401802144,null,0,false,0,chy0lcf,t3_275pg3,t1_chy0lcf,t3_275pg3,null,1434074019,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

A loan with a 4.5% APR may actually be charging you 4% interest, but with some fees and other terms hidden in the fine print. APR is intended to give a figure that you can use to compare it to other similar products.

0% APR means you won't be paying any ongoing interest on the loan, that's a great deal - but there will often be some up-front fees to pay, that don't get factored into the APR calculation because they are up-front, and no interest is charged on them.

Wonga have APR so high because they are an extremely bad deal, as loans go. They are intended for short term because they would be unaffordable for anything but a very short term.

Public spying. Mass collection and storage of internet records, emails and text messages of all UK citizens. Secret deals with Facebook, google and microsoft. Breaking web encryption. Infiltrating companies. These are all genuine public interest stories and it is quite right to leak the details, and I appreciate him leaking the information so that we could learn about it. Our security services are not supposed to indiscriminately spy on all of us or harvest data behind our backs.

But surveilling foreign countries, spying on foreign leaders (Merkel's phone) etc - this is the JOB of our security services. They are supposed to spy on others, to make sure that the UK is secure and to help us get the upper hand in international dealings. We spy on people so that we can stay one step ahead.

Revealing the precise location of secret bases in foreign countries. Sorry, but how is that AT ALL in the public interest? How is that anything other than a blatant attack on the UK?

I'd call him a traitor, but Snowden isn't even fucking British. He's an American. So let's think about this for a moment - he is a foreign citizen who is basically attacking the UK now. Of course I blame the Americans and the British government for giving this guy (a contractor, not even a proper government employee ffs) so much access to information about UK security. But I also blame him for releasing this sort of information.

When he was spilling the beans on the government reading our emails, that was fair enough. He talked a lot about civil liberties and how he was standing up for citizens. That's great, and certainly the Guardian helped to cultivate that message and I supported it entirely. But this now is starting to seem like his leaks weren't actually based on civil liberties at all. And nor were his leaks selective stories that were in the public interest. They were indiscriminate leaks of all sorts of information, and the Guardian/WP have been drip feeding them to cause maximum embarrassment, damage and distrust in the government. And what's more - this guy is now guiding our foreign policy and interfering with our relationship with other countries. That is simply wrong. What makes this one guy in any way qualified to decide things for the UK? Even if you dislike this government, they have hundreds or thousands of information sources and specialists around the world who create our foreign policy. We shouldn't be dictated by one contractor.

And what's more- the guy hides out in Russia, an enormous violator of civil rights, rather than facing up to what he did in the US or the UK.

true,robdabank,JE,jersey,"There are, but it's not the same as it is in Europe. The level below the MLS is the NASL or CSL (if you're in Canada). But there isn't the promotion/relegation system that exists in Europe.

You can't just jump into the MLS, established teams like the New York Cosmos and the Tampa Bay Rowdies are good examples of clubs that have been around since the 1970s and are still playing in the second division.

The league awards cities ""expansion franchises"" depending on a set of criteria.

- Team owners are committed to the MLS and have the financial means to build a team

- Ownership of a stadium or approved plans for a stadium (preferably a soccer specific stadium) that allows the team to control revenue streams such as parking and concessions

- The size of the market of the metropolitan area (i.e. no teams are going to be in Wyoming)

- An established local fan base 

So there's a financial element to it - Beckham illustrated this best when he exercised a $25 million option to buy an expansion franchise establish a future Miami based team for 2017. Although he's part of an investment group, so there's more money in it.

NYC FC has plans to build a 25,000 seat stadium in Flushing Meadows near the site of the US Open.

Orlando City has plans to build a $110 million football stadium. 

You get the idea.

It's a little Mickey Mouse-y to have a team essentially buy a place in the top division while older teams are forced to sit in the NASL with no real hope of promotion without substantial financial backing. 

That being said I think it's the best way for an non-organic sport like football to take root in the US. Keep in mind the MLS was running at a loss for like 6 years to the tune of about $700 million dollars. You want to grow the league but you'd also want stable financial partners in expansion teams. 

Keep in mind that community stakeholders (supporters groups) are taken into account. If a city doesn't give a shit about football, they're not going to give the city a franchise. So it's not totally a business endeavour, the league will give the franchise ultimately to a city that gives a shit about the sport. Which is why you won't see an MLS franchise in Alabama and poses the question - why are they trying to expand into Georgia.

**tl;dr**  - You *can* jump straight into the MLS if you jump through the hoops the league sets up for prospective expansion teams. 

**Edit:** I guess I forgot to answer your question.  You can't just jump into the MLS, but NYC FC passed the criteria established by the league for expansion franchises and have expressed a commitment to building a football specific ground.

When I was a ward monkey death certificates were always the first things I did when I came in in the morning for exactly the reasons you state.

However, there are a few complicating things.  The certificate should be signed by someone who treated the deceased.  Some wards have lots of different doctors and the ones who were caring for your mother might be off on leave or rest.  In such a case the consultant should fill it in.  Also, if your mother had a pacemaker and you plan to cremate, then there's a few more hoops to jump through which can add a day to the time it takes to get the certificate released.

My advice is to speak to the ward sister on the phone.  If you don't have any luck with that, call the secretary of the consultant who was in charge of your mother's care.

Second was my last bike, a streetfightered FZS600, I don't think I will that good luck ever again, low mileage, mechanically perfect and 2k in aftermarket extras, all for £750 on an ebay auction only one other bidder half heartedly competed with me on. The owner had to sell urgently along with another 2 bikes he had as his wife's car got pinched due to her leaving the keys in it so no claiming on insurance.

The third is my current bike, £760, well... I had to have bad luck eventually. The guy lived about 2 hours away so viewing wasn't really feasible, the bike is fine now £450 in repairs later but the last owner had no bloody clue and i'm surprised he even knew which way round to sit on it.

Left outside uncovered for 3 years with only 300 miles done in that time, the flywheel magnets had come loose destroying the whole generator and starter clutch assembly, the oil was as black as a disney villain's heart, there was more rust than bike and it gets hot enough to cook on.

Both this policy and QE look like band aids.

The claims of your earlier post that this offers a solution to climate change are laughable. Going from ""the government should give out money in a different way"" to ""this will fix climate change"" is stupid.

Then I invested a few hours reading through [This Thread on the NASA Spaceflight.com forum](http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=33648.0) where there are plenty of people Much Cleverer Than I who seem (on balance) to be convinced that:

1. There are very few major, and a surprisingly small number of minor, technical risks remaining with the Skylon system, and there's a valid plan for tackling pretty much all of this risk.
1. The Economics of the approach make considerable sense for *all* concerned, from designer to builder to operator to customer.

The two are inexorably linked: Alan Bond's a smart man who has been badly burnt once already, and so refuses (sensibly) to take the government shilling for this invention. This means having to prove things as they go, which is slower and not helped at all by a lack of infrastructure to test with (example: the SABRE engine will be about the size of, but deliver 8x the thrust and (unknown, but probably) 100x the *noise* of a Trent 800 used on the A380. So where and how will you test one without upsetting the neighbours 10 miles away?).

So the approach is incremental and clever: Partner with other companies to both build and operate. Subcontract the airframe to a partner, they make money building it. Sell the vehicles to interested users (market: at least 93 national space agencies) and show them how they make money operating it. Show how to operate it in ""ferry"" mode so smaller countries (like the UK!) can buy one, load it up with payload, fly somewhere with a good launch spot (Kourou), fuel it up there and go.

There are of course problems: this approach means it's unlikely poor old Alan Bond will ever see a Skylon go orbital (he's 78(?) and first flight of an orbital prototype isn't for another 10 years). And, paradoxically, they seem to spend time fending **off** money and interest from government parties (aka ""The Concorde Effect""). And then there's Mr Musk with his own version of incremental: Build a classic disposable booster then iteratively morph it into a reusable system (...the folks on the NSF forum don't seem too impressed with the long-term prospects: loses 40% or more of F9 disposable's payload, will only be reusable ~10 times). But as with everything in life it's another case of first-to-market wins rather than best-product...

Plus, there's some good bickering over whether Skylon's more like Thunderbird 2, Thunderbird 3 or Fireball XL5...",0,1401809269,null,0,false,0,chy3ggb,t3_275voa,t1_chy3ggb,t3_275voa,null,1434075350,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

* Like our opposite sex marriages, there's no requirement for parental permission for younger brides and grooms 

* The biggie - the [spousal veto](http://www.c4em.org.uk/drop-the-spousal-veto/). Basically, couples where one (or both, I suppose?) is trans* will get a much better deal in Scotland. 

* The bill also included a provision to force the Scottish Govt to look at the future of civil partnerships, although that was passed by Westminster, so that'll be interesting to say the least.. 

* For those in civil partnerships, there are more options for converting these to marriages (if that is the wish of the couple). In England and Wales, you fill out a form.

Just a few here: In the end, all his companions leave him, or even die. He knows that when he takes them (or they get stuck with him ie. Lucie Miller) until the day it happens. He is overwhelmed with the guilt of the thousands of years of companions he's lost. He can't stop it though, if he tries to travel along things only get worse, and people choose to come with him, he doesn't make them.

He's had to make many choices in his life, but the one that weighs on him the most was when he committed double genocide to save the universe. He had to kill his entire race, just to stop the daleks from exterminating all life.

A companion later down the road (one that you haven't met yet) says that he makes people a danger to themselves, because they always have to risk their lives to prove themselves to him. Shit gets rough for him.

Personally I think this attitude is fine until they mark you (correctly or incorrectly) as a threat. Then you're completely and utterly fucked.   
GCHQ is allowed to operate more or less outside of the law and my question for you is if you think its acceptable that we fund a department that is like this. There is no way that the people funding it will ever find out what the money is spent on and there is almost zero public accountability.

To try to drag it back on topic, I think it's daft that we had to go, cap in hand, to ask Westminster to change some of their legislation to allow us to push the boat out with our same-sex marriage law (we needed a few minor tweaks to the Equality Act 2010, and equality is a Reserved power (not kidding!)). I think it's daft that every law we pass we have to wait to see if Westminster want to veto it... =/ We're more than capable of legislating for ourselves, as evidenced by that bill.

Going back to the original original point, kinda, I think that we need more immigration, and Westminster legislates for the SE of England, not appreciating our different democraphics and economies. I love my family and friends (and the boy I'm dating) who are English, but I don't think the Union works in the 21st Century. I think us and the rest of the UK and Ireland and the Crown Dependencies and whoever else could work better through the British-Irish Council, like the Nordic Council does. And we could work together if and when our interests match through the EU or other international bodies. And when our interests don't match, we can vote accordingly and stop bitching at one another about governments not representing one another.

Also look at teams that don't have big leaders and we don't exactly have a lot of experienced players to guide the younger ones - AC Milan have completely fallen from grace in recent years after losing Gattuso, Seedorf, Ambrosini and Nesta, amongst others. With the exception of Nesta they've got and had better players in the midfield yet when their 3rd choice elder midfielders left the club fell apart.

true,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"The latest Paul Tomkins column is a bit of a long cumbersome read but if you like this sort of thing, it's worth it and I think it brings *a lot* of perspective to the transfer window. [I brought up this subject a couple years ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/17og7u/my_longheld_theory_is_that_most_managers_will_be/) (March '12) and Paul Tomkins actually stated that 50% of transfers succeed but now he has adjusted the numbers a bit to state that now only 40% of transfers can be considered a ""success"" or at least neutral.

(Of course, ""success"" is a subjective term but I tend to trust how Tomkins evaluates players).

Just for fun, let's take Brendan Rodgers' transfers so far:

**Summer 2012**

* Borini

* Yesil

* Sahin

* Assaidi

* Allen

**January 2013**

* Coutinho

* Sturridge

**Summer 2013**

* Kolo

* Aspas

* Alberto

* Mignolet

* Cissokho

* Sakho

* Ilori

* Moses [loan]

**January 2014**

* n/a

That's 15 transfers (apologies if I missed any but you get the idea). Just at a quick glance, I'd say the following players could be considered a success or at least neutral: Borini, Allen, Coutinho, Sturridge, Kolo, Mignolet, Sakho. That's about a 46% ""success"" rate and so if you think about this in the context of Tomkins' theory then that's not a bad bit of work by Rodgers, et al.

What's the point of this going forward? Well, I think for me, it's a bit of perspective and a reminder that we have to accept the fact that no matter how great the transfer looks on paper, that sometimes the *can't-miss* transfers miss and the *WTF* signing will work out.",0,1401813608,null,0,false,0,chy5hgb,t3_277n91,t1_chy5hgb,t3_277n91,null,1434076374,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

Overall, I enjoyed it. I found the teaching to be excellent and the facilities to be great. However, there are some teachers which cannot teach the module that they were running to the point of where we had to teach the content ourselves and where modules involving group projects would become a nightmare and unmanageable.

I think the University can definitely improve and it is improving (it has certainly made improvements since I first started) but one area which will be a challenge to the University is getting more student's involved in the Student's Union. Activity around the union isn't that great and majority of the student's just ignore them. For example whenever there are Student Union elections and whenever societies try to advertise for new members and events. If more student's get involved with improving the University I feel that things will get better.

He viewed simply having two similar players there as balance. Therefore, he reacted by putting Eriksen in his free role out wide to get him the ball in space because we couldn't from the center, and gave him two strikers up front to cross in to because we were incapable on the ground. Considering Sherwood was trying to do what he could to make his case as presentable as possible to Levy at the end of the season, it was the move to take the easy, emergency route of using what we had at the moment to provide immediate results rather than fix our issues and look to build a more balanced system.

What this is establishes then, is a very shaky foundation. As we saw with the capitulations and going down easily and quickly to teams we should easily handle, this emergency setup and its lack of balance was not great at reacting to problems, psychologically or physically, and was easily flaunted by the better teams. We were able to drag through points against the weaker sides due to sheer individual quality at the end, not because it was an effective and progressive plan.

Chalobah, need an extra body in midfield and he seems to be developing pretty nicely. Could do with some games in midfield to prove his worth, any more loans at this stage would be pointless and would send him down the ""mceachran"" route.

You can perhaps add more caveats or expand out your point to make more sense but as it stands your point is that basically a dlp will result in us not conceding late goals - which doesn't make any sense. And considering we were the best team in the pl at holding late leads - and we do not have a dlp -

&gt;Early eugenics was used to justify racism BUT this wasn't about hate, those involved seriously believed in the superiority of one race over another, and thus the right to enslave them or to colonise them etc...

People who thought that way weren't racist. Even nowerdays, generally the things most people assume to be true, do so because of valid reasons. If it turned out that new evidence came to light that some things were not as we had presumed, you wouldn't then say we were at fault for believing them. People have to base their actions on what they know in the moment. The advantage of hindsight doesn't give you some divine right to look down on people.

You can't raise taxes on normal people that much because there would be riots. You can raise taxes on the wealthy, but how much you'd actually gain from that is likely to be pretty minimal. Plus look how well it's worked out for Hollande in France. You can clamp down on corporation tax, however lots of that is still avoided in loopholes, and could involve heavy lengthy legal battles and wouldn't vastly improve the situation quickly; so even if it is essential in the long term, it doesn't help short term which is what you need. You can't borrow much more because that just adds the the debt, fixes nothing and is political suicide. Therefore, you have to cut spending.

 You can't cut defence drastically because we were still engaged in a war, and even if you disagree with the war, pulling out without warning would be leaving the Afghans to be massacred. Defence cuts have to be gradual and in line with a withdrawal plan. Which doesn't help in the short term.

The only public support for cutting expenditure is for [foreign aid](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2010/07/14/884103/-Poll-People-want-government-spending-cut-but) (apologies for dailykos, it's shite but it had the poll statistics). But cutting that can only get you so far.

So you have to start cutting public expenditure, which means benefits, public sectors services, tuition fees (of which they only raised the upper limit , the universities are actually the ones who raised it to £9000), housing allowances, schemes etc. You cant cut one central service completely, so you have to make the savings across the board. Yes this hurts vulnerable  people, yes it impacts in a painful way, and yes rich people aren't going to be hurt in the same way as poor people.  

Green energy remains frankly, pathetic. Hydroelectric and geothermal work well in other countries, but they can't here. Solar and Wind are about as powerful as replacing coal power stations with a hamster in a wheel. We continue to invest in scientifically viable international solutions like the [Joint European Torus reactor](http://motherboard.vice.com/en_uk/blog/the-nuclear-fusion-arms-race-is-underway) which is good, money well spent. However in times where money is tight, particularly when you are already making cuts to benefits and core services like police and the NHS, you can't then set aside more money to invest in green energy. When the good times return in a few years, certainly. There simply isn't the money right now.

Much like everyone else on the team that season, after hitting so many posts and dropping points when we had no excuse to, confidence was at a low. I thought he was serviceable in his one season under BR though and provided a decent outlet to recycle possession and tracked back constantly.

That being said, Lallana fits into BR's tactics and he is able to create space and looks for himself in tight spaces while on the ball. Downing didn't have the ability to run at defenders and was as vanilla as possible on offense; Lallana at least brings creativity along with a decent defensive work rate.

You had to see him in the WCC and Corinthians. He is a mix of Ramires and SB (Box-to-Box) with less speed but more technique.

You make a fair point with your follow up comment but considering the conservatives were in for 4 terms it's no surprise some money had to be spent on the country. 'the market' doesn't make peoples lives better.

&gt; You can't raise taxes on normal people that much because there would be riots. 

raising VAT does in fact effect normal people more than wealthier people. This is why labour wanted NI and income tax altered rather than VAT. Also VAT pushes prices up as well as inflation. Hurray for normal people! http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12099638

&gt; You can raise taxes on the wealthy, but how much you'd actually gain from that is likely to be pretty minimal.

I guess we could change a few laws and prosecute tax evaders and block aggressive multinationals trading here. I guess we could just ask the super rich if they feel like contributing, makes it discretionary!! 

&gt;  Plus look how well it's worked out for Hollande in France. 

I don't know about those countries. We should have made like Iceland and imprisoned the ones responsible if you ask me. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%9311_Icelandic_financial_crisis#Criminal_investigations

&gt; Therefore, you have to cut spending.

Fine, every party argued about cutting spending. Labour were doing that and had a growing economy when this coalition came in.

Cutting foreign aid is obviously foolish and I'm glad we haven't done that.

As to what you said about green energy:
&gt; According to WWF, Osborne and Hayes have ""significantly"" undermined investment confidence in the renewable energy sector. ""Several major companies have already shelved their planned investment in the UK's renewable energy supply chain whilst others are reconsidering their future investment due to the political risk and lack of certainty created. Yet ironically, the CBI has repeatedly said that the green economy and the renewable energy sector are among the few bright spots for economic recovery in the UK, offering substantial potential for jobs, exports and investment."" 

http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/20/david-cameron-climate-pledges-rogue-conservatives - and now we have fracking! more lovely carbon with added water contamination and mining!! woop for the normal people!

Manufacturing in Britain cannot be explained by your chart. I cannot find a source but I watched some news program where some politicians and factory owners argued over how changes to the tax system had in effect made it much more difficult to compete. It was something to do with replacing equipment tax rebates. I forget. But that chart of yours doesn't tell me much.

Anyways. They should be building more house which would reduce the price of renting which in turn would reduce the cost to the government in housing benefits and reduce said benefits going straight into the pocket of wealthy property owners.The wealthy people who, at the same time as charging more and more extortionate rent, take less and less care of their tenants.

As a manager he plays good attacking football and is keen on youth and scouting. He's done wonders and Feyenoord in the last 3 seasons he led a a very young and inexperienced squad, to a 2nd, 3rd and 2nd placed finishes.
However early in his career he did have some disasters. At Valencia most notably and his tenure at Ajax wasn't great either. He was extremely stubborn and not the best man manager. He refused to play Van Der Vaart and Sneijder at the same time because he claimed the don't work together which led to VDV being sold for much less than he was worth. However he has shown considerate personal growth recently. He was and is a young manager and like players when you're young you make mistakes. 
He seems like an great fit with us but it's a gamble.
As for Pelle he's good but I'm not entirely convinced he's premier league quality.He may prove me wrong. he's done well especially this season but i wouldn't like it if we signed him for more than £10 million. He's approaching 29 as well so he's not going to get much better.

Moreno has more interceptions, as noted by OP.  Moreno created a few more chances, but not a lot.  Moreno gets dispossessed less than Flanagan, but also has more turnovers.

I'm in my 30s. I've houseshared since I was able to - basically since I went to uni at 18.

So..
Halls? Houseshare  
That first house you rent after halls? Shared.  
Graduate - shitty houseshare  
Early 20s - slightly less shitty houseshare, live a life of permanent debt. Afford a solitary beer a month.  
Late 20s - starting to get better money now, but houseshare regardless  
Whee I'm 30! Houseshare.  
Early 30s - nope, still housesharing  
Mid... etc. 

Housesharing is fun, but there are limits. I'm an adult now - I want to be able to invite people round without finding a kitchen full of washing up or a sink full of hair, or have to deal with someone going around slamming doors because I've asked them a question on the day they got out of the wrong side of bed. Equally, I'm very conscious of the effect I have on other people - I'm probably not easy to live with at times, and each year I probably get more stubborn with it if I'm honest. Work is where I make small talk to people to get through the day, then I come home and do the same.

Housemates are great at times - they keep people around you without having to go to too much effort. If you're lucky you get a pre-rolled set of friends on your doorstep. But it's not all fun and games, and frankly much past the 10 year point you really start to get sick of it. 

Some of the best times of my life have involved housemates, it's great when it works but when it doesn't you don't get an easy choice not to be around them. Sadly for most of us in London its all we can (just about) afford - or we live in a place like the studio in OP.

true,WDC312,lfc68,,"In football, both the offense and defense run set plays (though a few have options to change them during the play) each time the ball is snapped.  Typically, the offensive team will huddle after the end of each play and decide on a play to run for the next snap.  I'm not an expert, but on my understanding the coaching staff has a big say in what play is run, though the quarterback's input is important as well.

However, often teams will break from the huddle and line up in the formation they've chosen, only to find that the defense is set up in a way that looks like it will counteract the offense's chosen play very well.  (For instance, if the offense chose a play that gives the ball to the running back and has him run straight up the middle, but the defense has eight men in the box....you're gonna have a bad time.)  Often, when this happens the quarterback will *audible* out of the play at the line of scrimmage.

The team has established codewords before the game (and practiced with them in practice) that signify certain changes to the play.  For instance, the quarterback might yell ""Blue fifteen!"" to tell the wide receiver on the right to run a streak route (straight down the field) rather than the route he's currently planning on running.  Or he might yell something to tell the offensive line to spread out, pinch together, or shift left to right.  He might call a whole new play instead of adjusting individual players.  It's really interesting, and very tactical (obviously) as teams try to bluff each other and figure out what the other one's doing.  Go on /r/nfl for more (they usually have weekly stupid/noob question threads) because I really don't know all that much about it.

Anyway, Peyton Manning is one of the best quarterbacks of his generation, and is *really really really* good at calling audibles before the snap.  Virtually every play the Broncos run, he will call an audible.  In fact, a lot of the time they don't even huddle to decide on the play, they just line up the way they did for the last play and Peyton will call something new.  This is called the ""hurry-up"" offense, and it can be really hard for the defense to handle because if the offense isn't huddling to decide plays, the defense gets no time to adjust their plays.  Defenses do call audibles sometimes (I think usually the center does it) but it's not as big a thing as offensive audibles.  At least, coverage of the NFL barely talks about defensive audibles.

For the last few games of the regular season last year, and in the playoffs, one thing Peyton kept yelling at the line was ""Omaha!""  He would yell this on many, many plays.  A lot of people tried to guess, or ask Peyton, what it meant, but they didn't have much success.  Most likely it was an empty call designed to confuse the defense and disguise the real audible calls.

Exactly, you can't raise taxes on poor people ""that much"" - the deficit was pretty substantial, a VAT increase was inevitable. An income tax increase would have had to have been pretty colossal to net the same amount. Getting more tax out of people rich enough to afford Jimmy Carr's accountants isn't easy, certainly isn't quick. Nor is clamping down on tax evaders and aggressive foreign nationals. While I agree that things need to be done about those problems, but it's going to take a while, we still need to fix the deficit. 

&gt; We should have made like Iceland and imprisoned the ones responsible if you ask me.

You know perfectly well the situation in Iceland, which is a country with the same population as Coventry, is not really equivalent to the UK. Who exactly is responsible is incredibly difficult (and therefore costly) to prove in court, and doesn't fix the deficit. The government did however introduce the [Banking Reform Act](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/banking-reform-act-becomes-law) which at the very least helps.

&gt; and now we have fracking! more lovely carbon with added water contamination and mining!! woop for the normal people!

Fracking, like nuclear power, is perfectly fine when done correctly. [Provided there are strong regulations that are reflective of the science, should be no problems.

With what money? Mass investment in housing would be a good thing, however so would paying the police more, NHS staff more, increasing operating budgets for public sector departments etc etc etc. Until the money returns as the economy continues to improve, these things can't happen in any meaningful way. But the economy is improving, so hopefully they will be happening soon.

I can't say that i ever expected to see this statement made about Azza. 

He frequently (for years) has failed to spring teammates into an opportunity because he just didn't see the chance to make the pass and instead just barrels down the pitch where he more often then not just tried to put the ball across to space and hoped someone was there.  ""Vision"" has never been one of his strong suits. Movement he is solid with, but he just doesn't pick up on the runs people are making with any true consistency.

His interplay with Walker has always been strong and he puts in a great deal of effort into putting a defensive shift in whenever he is on the pitch. I would say that in the past he mainly served as a ""disruption"" on the field....his job was to use his pace to ensure that the opposing defence respected the right flank.  He has never had a great final ball, he cannot finish and even when his pace was beyond anyone on the pitch he was actually wildly predictable (go to the endline lob mediocre cross into the box and hope for the best).

I like Azza but i just don't think it is a great fit for him in Poch's system, he just doesn't bring enough to the table with what Poch would **Want** to do especially with players like Lamela, Chadli, Andros, Pritch and any new signings pushing for time on the pitch.

HMRC won't have an issue with you renting the property to your sister as long as you make sure that the rent is set at a 'market rate'.  However, if you make a tax loss on the rent then that loss is ring-fenced and can't be set off against other income except income in respect of renting property to your sister.  This rule applies when someone rents property to close family members.

As far as telling HMRC i would tell them that you are buying a house and renting it to your sister.  As regards giving her a share when you sell it, treat it as a gift at point of sale.  Don't complicate it by telling anyone beforehand as you start to fall into the 'trusts' rules.

I think under a different Manager he could have been given a chance to get his legs back and return to some of his glory, but when Cole, Mata and Lampard were shrugged off, you can bet Essien had zero chance.

Lampard's exit for me is too early, he's still a great player but he isn't a CDM and that's why he left. Lampard will always be an attacking midfielder regardless of position and it's why he has so many goals to his name. The problem is that Mourinho is using a fast counter attack that really only suits fast players who don't mind playing deep.. and that isn't Lampard.

If he does move to the MLS he's going to absolutely demolish the League with Villa because you can bet they will build their team and tactics around those two, and when you have Defoe playing well over there, you can be sure him and Villa are going to be scoring plenty.

It doesn't have to be a dangerous crime. A burglary definitely warrants dialling 999. 

[Sussex Police](http://www.sussex.police.uk/policing-in-sussex/transparency/policies-and-procedures/force-policies/call-grades-and-deployment-policy) will classify a call as an I-Grade, which means Police should attend within 15 minutes, if (amongst other things) ""An offender has just been disturbed at the scene.""

Now what occasionally happens is that HMRC don't properly transmit the code to the employer, and you should ask HMRC to resend it.  You may need to ring them a few times to find someone who understands this and is willing to do the necessary.

Simultaneously, ask your employer to check that they are using the right code.  They should receive the codes from HMRC but may not be updating their system.

It may take a couple of months before everything is in sync, but when that happens your employer's payroll software should automactically correct for any over/under payments.

Note that if you've got a pension and you're a 40% taxpayer you MAY have to do a tax return to get the tax deduction for the the tax paid between 20%-40% (you've won't have to do this if your company runs a salary sacrifice pension scheme)",0,1401827776,null,0,false,0,chycgc0,t3_26pplf,t1_chycgc0,t3_26pplf,null,1434079653,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2

Introduce full capitalist ideas to the max.

Raise interest rates so the prudent aren't shafted, you stretched your budget while also being aware of global issues, tough shit.

Force land banks to release land or build more houses, no compliance, tax to fuck so you go bust.

Rent controls, no relief for second home owners (casual btl, holiday homes), can't afford your status symbol, sell your home at the price you want, tough shit

Workfare every company is allowed an allocation of workfare candidates dependant on size. You must top up wages to be viable to the employee, you think it's a free turn over of employees, wrong, recognisable skills need to be passed on(dependant on industry), you reach your quota within x employees, tough shit it's your struggle now.

Teachers(excluding primary) /politicians, no entry into this line of work until 10 years of private sector employment.

Nimby's, you don't want a nuclear power / housing development on your doorstep, fair enough it's ugly but tough shit you are now onto a second tier grid, don't complain when public funds or services are redirected.

Legalise weed and tax accordingly.

Re asses all public sector contracts

Have plenty more, but the bad the alcohol and bad day at work maybe influencing this.

Yes, a lack of talent. He is a good player, but even in top form he never showed anything that, to name one example, De Bruyne did not do.

He is way better than Mata or he would never have been considered for Barca, but he is below the intensity and pressing we need in midfield. If passing abillity, dribbling and composure with the ball was more important than pressing and engine Allen would start ahead of Hendo.

It's why Coutinho and Sterling where being rotated rather than Hendo.

I didn't think much of these girls, like the people you see every morning on the bus. Until one night I was stupid enough to walk my dog through Taughmona. (I lived at the Andytown side of the cross roads). I walked past this group of girls and took me a few seconds to think 'oh yeah, that those girls I see at the cross roads all the time'. Suddenly I felt a blow to the back of my head my dogs lead was grabbed from me, and she was crying and struggling. They beat the living shit out of me, but thankfully didn't hurt my dog, just let her watch her owner get beaten. They let go of the lead and ran off, my dog also ran into to some garden. I coaxed her out and walked back home with a bloody lip and a black eye. My body was totally covered in bruises. Stuck to walking her in the woodlands and musgrave after that.

Also, I was a care child. One residential I was in I met the 3 other girls I was to share a room with (I was about 8 and brought up on the Malone Road.. pretty ignorant to sectarianism other than visiting my maternal family in north Belfast). The girls asked me to say the alphabet, I got to 'h' and they all pounced. I was given a family placement the next day... on the Newtownards road. Abuse continued because i was a camogie player so kids would see me in my school and club uniforms. Ah well.

&gt;

&gt;The __British Rail Class 455__ is a type of [electric multiple unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_multiple_unit) drawing power from a 750 V DC [third rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_rail). Built by [BREL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BREL) at [York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York) works in the early and mid-1980s, they were initially categorised as Class 510 as the successor to the Class 508.  They are used on suburban services in South [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London), by [South West Trains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_West_Trains) and [Southern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_(train_operating_company\)).

Indoors, the Bay - Doctor Who Experience (if you are into it, otherwise pricey, but very British); the Senedd (National Assembly of Wales, free)

Outdoors - take the water taxi between the centre and the bay (about 2£ one way)

Outside of Cardiff - take the bus to see the Roman fort and amphitheatre of Caerleon, just outside of Newport (free); take the 20min train journey to see Caerphilly Castle (rather that Cardiff Castle)

Food - Have afternoon tea at Pettigrew Tea Rooms in Bute Park; go to Wetherspoons for a burger and drink for 5.95£ (there are better pubs though if you are serious though!) and see their massive ladies loos!; go to Chippy Alley in the evening for a newspaper cone of chips and malt vinegar (the alley itself has multiple chip shops along it)

Entertainment - look up cinema/theatre/etc going on at Chapter in Canton (arts centre/cinema/gallery/café very welcoming and popular with locals); look up performances at St Davids Hall (comedy, opera), the Millenium Centre in the Bay (musicals, orchestra), the National Theatre in the centre; gawk at St Marys St on a Friday/Saturday night...

The hyperbole itself breaks down due to the issue of consent, which you then go on to consider.

You're right to highlight the ""pressure"" issue and it is (so far as I've seen) the most common and pressing concern that people raise against the law being changed.

However - there are numerous safeguards that have been proposed to avoid this sort of problem, and they are already in place in various countries and at least one US state: Washington.

So far as I know those places where people have the right to die see fewer people choosing the option than take that route - it would seem to be a comforting factor to have that option if they want it. Indeed I think it's also the case that those who have the option tend to live longer than those who don't: it implies that people who are not afraid of how the end might come/will be are able to enjoy longer and happier lives.

The ""concern"" angle only goes so far, and I've seen it go around and around for some years now. I'm not sure that the people who keep coming back to it are of a mind to acknowledge that it is possible to avoid the issue, at least as far as it is possible (like now) to avoid any such person taking their own life for those reasons.",0,1401830099,null,0,false,0,chydlh1,t3_277jx8,t1_chydlh1,t1_chyc0s5,null,1434080256,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

For £4, you can get a daysaver bus ticket which lets you travel anywhere in Birmingham and the surrounding areas on as many buses as you want that day. If you're going to be there for a specific period of time it might be cheaper to get a travelcard. (If you buy a monthly travelcard it works out as about £1.70 per day for unlimited bus travel.)

I think as a Swiss person you can apply for jobs here without any special visas, but you'll need to double check this. Giving French lessons is a possibility. Swiss French is close enough to ordinary French that people will be interested.

I'd say Birmingham was medium-friendly towards strangers. If you ask for directions, you'll get them, but people won't randomly start trying to chat to you at bus-stops.

true,tone_,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"I'm not interested in your ""short story"" dude or defining racism. I have no interest in discussing this really. I wasn't asking for info or looking to discuss it in this depth.

I simply pointed out the fact that saying ""how do we know he's a muslim, is this kind of racism okay?"" was a dumb sentence. Not only because you brought it up when the article could well have done its research. You jumped on the race issue and because evidence wasn't given, you claimed it was somehow racist.

Racism and stereotyping. Stereotyping is usually done by accident, or can be the product of experience or even truth. Racism **has** to come from an intent to be racist. No matter what spin you put on it, you've either got someone with an irrational hatred, or someone making a non politically correct judgement based on physiological differences (be that race, gender, disability etc) that is not *always* the correct one, because as humans with empathy we place certain rules and guidelines on ourselves.

I don't believe you're as dumb as the argument you're using. Each of your examples are based on social etiquette and societal values. A person can compare anyone with anything else and the reaction to it will be based upon what is acceptable to say. Any observation or comment is not racism, unless it comes from irrational hatred and is more often that not; incorrect. A scientist could probably tell you the similarities and differences between white people, black people and the gorillas in your example. If that scientist was explaining this to someone who was making genuine racist comments, then that scientist isn't a racist for merely following the scientific method is he? It comes down to context and how people express the facts that they know and the things they are ignorant of. You can't **always** write out a little story and have a right answer to a tickbox of ""racist"" and ""not racist"".

Especially those that have been this way for life or lost their hearing later on but became proficient lipreaders.

I wouldn't say no to a Level 1 BSL course though if it was offered. Even if you only learn the basic ""small talk"" as well as fingerspelling (which is easily practiced online) then you will at least be able to interact with those that have BSL as their first language.

Just as exaggerating your mouth movements can distort what you're saying, shouting does the same thing and I'm *less* likely to understand you if you shout.

I'm used to lipreading normal speech. Most people don't even realise I can't hear them (as long as they're facing me and already have my attention) because it's so natural to me to just watch your mouth and other facial/body signals in order to interpret what you're saying.

If you shout, slow down or try to exaggerate your mouth movements then it's like trying to understand a foreign language that I've never seen before! 

If I ask you to repeat something, please don't be offended or try to slow down or shout it. Although many deaf people are very good at using context and lipreading to understand conversations, we do miss things sometimes and it's best to just repeat yourself while ensuring the person you're speaking to can see your face clearly. 

Having lights/a window behind you casting shadows on your face makes it harder for me to see what you're saying. If after two or three tries, I don't understand then it's often best to move to another position where the light isn't working against me.

Even in perfect conditions though, lipreading is hard and tiring. If I still don't understand you after a couple of repetitions, please don't give up and get frustrated with me as that makes me feel awful and useless. Try expressing your intended reply in a different way.

So if I can't understand you saying ""I had an amazing weekend!"" then try rephrasing it as ""this weekend was wonderful!"".

Thank you for caring enough to ask :D
