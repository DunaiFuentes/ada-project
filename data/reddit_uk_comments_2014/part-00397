false,SYSTEM_USER,null,null,"Ah. CSC. My hospital recently came to the end of a contract with them. Good riddance is the only thing we could say.

The contract had been entered into by central government (the actual department was Connecting for Health). However, the two parties to the contract had managed to have the contract classified as confidential, so even though individual hospitals were bound to the terms of the contract, they were not allowed to see it. It was negotiated and signed by CfH on behalf of individual hospitals, and the hospitals were bound to it.

CSC got the contract to supply an IT system (a system for saving medical images, and for viewing them - the technical name for this is Picture Archiving and Communication System or PACS). They tried to develop a system in-house, thinking that this was a simple problem. 

They couldn't seem to get it right. Very shortly before the ""deadline"" date, they demoed as system that was basically a joke, and they knew it. A good friend of mine was the hospital's project manager, and I thought he was going to have a breakdown from the stress - as basically, it was his job on the line, if it all went tits-up. The deadline was a legal requirement for NHS hospitals. They had to have a digital image system in and working by a certain date. If they didn't, the hospital was liable for a fine of several £100ks.

In the end, CSC decided to abandon their development work, and bought an off-the-shelf-system from a major vendor of this type of software.

As it happened, the software vendor knew that CSC were desperate and completely stitched them up. Under the terms of the contract, individual hospitals were liable for all costs that CSC incurred (both in house development and external procurements), so that didn't bother them.

The result was a system that worked and was acceptable. The problem was support. 

The support was via CSC, and the software vendor would only take support calls from CSC. Hence, in the event of a system malfunction, you would have to log a call with CSC, hope that their tech support understood the issue, and then correctly passed it on the the software vendor (if a software problem). This game of Chinese whispers frequently went awry.

The best bit, however, was the end of contract. We asked CSC what they were going to do with the hard drives with our data on them. ""We're going to shred them. We hope that you don't want the medical records stored on them"".

Obviously, the answer was that we did want the data. ""Ah"", came the reply. ""OK. We can build a solution for you. We'll procure you a 20 TB EMC Clariion, and we'll copy the data onto it. We reckon this will need about 10 days consultancy at £3k per day, and about £50k to purchase the 20 TB storage system. Obviously, we can't start the data transfer until after the system is decomissioned and your servers are transported to our offices. The data copy will take a week or two, and then we'll ship you the hard drives which you can give to your new solution vendor. Of course, this means you'll be without access to your medical records for a couple of weeks, but that can't be helped.""

Anyway, little did CSC know that we had got wise to their deliberate attempts to make work for themselves. 2 years in advance of contract end, we had found a software development company who built a system to ""sneak copy"" the data off the main servers onto a NAS, without tripping the ""excess server load"" alarms (Yes. Copying the data from the servers was explicitly prohibited by the contract). I remember the meeting we had to discus the end-of-contract data transfer plan (which they charged us £3k for - 8 man-hours of consultancy to send a pair of engineers to a meeting). You should have seen their faces when we told them, ""Actually. We don't think we'll be taking you up on this offer.""",0,1420048452,null,0,1420049514,0,cnah5la,t3_2qwzn1,t1_cnah5la,t3_2qwzn1,null,1425129553,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

Schneiderlin though i think is one of the best midfielders in the league, very strong defensively and fairly good attcking, he completely changes the way southampton play.

I've worked on communes both in Israel, Canada, and the UK. Parecon is written by ideologues who have either never seen the real world or are blinded by their ideology.

I think you need to re-think your resistance to markets. There is nothing wrong with incentivizing profit. Like I said before, it turns dicks into servants. We'll always need to have good incentives for people to invent, work, take risk etc.

As to markets centralizing power, I think you're terribly wrong. Think of the worst monopoly you can think of in recent decades (General Oil would work but let's take Microsoft) - the market dominance lasted a fraction of the timeframe that a government does: see for example the Persian empire, which many suffered under and would have liked to escape. Microsoft PERHAPS had a dominant position for a decade, and even during that time I was using alternatives by other companies (SUSE, RedHat etc) for both fun and profit. 

I'll take that over ""electing delegates"" any day. Because those delegates will eventually need to be given the power to trample over someone's rights (maybe them damn proprietarians!) and then you're right back to politics like we have today.

I.e. Stoke on Trent city council (in Staffordshire, just a different authority) has recently spent £7million on a bus station that isn't big enough, to build a shopping centre on the site of the old bus station that nobody wants and they can't rent the retail units in. They have also spent £70million on the shell of a building (no electric, data, water or decoration) as office space that again nobody wants, is going to cost several million to finish, is of substandard construction and may have to be refit as accommodation to try and recoup their losses. 

This is the same council that knocked down a couple of hundred houses on the way into the city centre, but failed to apply for EU funding to replace them, leaving brown field sites alongside one of the main approaches.

Edit: Oh they are also moving the head office of the council to a new location and selling the old to pay for it. Except the old one cannot be sold so they are going to keep both at a cost of over £40million, whilst simultaneously closing all public toilets to save £17000 a year.

Edit 2: not to forget the £2million plus they have and are still spending to try and get hs2 to stop at Stoke station, despite the fact this is a completely unworkable plan and the hs2 committee has already refused stokes offer.

But this is a discussion specific to Hong Kong, which is in a very different situation to Japan. Hongkongers have been aware for decades that Cantonese is useless outside Hong Kong, and Mandarin and English are both taught as foreign languages from a very early age. I've seen some interviews with Occupy Central protesters where they are speaking to Taiwanese interviewers in Mandarin. They are not obverse to Mandarin and recognise its benefits, and take pride in being bilingual in Mandarin/English and Cantonese, or trilingual in all three.

&gt; European languages like French, Germany, Portuguese, Spanish, and even Dutch are widely spoken across the world.

Dutch is most definitely not widely spoken across the world. Yet most Dutch people are completely fluent in English. Does that mean they should shift their primary language to English? No, they are Dutch, their native language is Dutch. But they speak English too. In Hong Kong, their native language is Cantonese, but many (an increasing number) speak Mandarin as well.

As for the CCP, they're not trying to 'shift' the primary language. They actually are trying to get rid of Cantonese completely, and to me, it's inexcusable to try to suppress the language and culture of millions of people like that.

EDIT: I've just read through this and I feel like it may come across as quite rude e.e So I'm sorry for that!

The private organisations can just issue bonds so essentially it's the central bank lending money to private organisations - but remember that money is created by the central bank to purchase (usually government) bonds and then it is amplified by the fractional reserve banking system leading to a large increase in total money supply (depending on whether you consider broad money or narrow money).

Basically it gets really complicated because the value is subjective based on the confidence of the bond market and it really just serves to facilitate economic growth and ensure sufficient provision of goods and services.

QE gives more money to banks, enabling them to lend more which can solve a liquidity crisis and prevent the economy grinding to a halt if banks can't lend and businesses can't fund operations. But the problem is if the economy is in a really bad place and banks don't feel confident lending, or businesses don't feel confident borrowing, then the benefit of QE is questionable.

Whether or not QE is good in the long-term is a continual argument but I think it was probably necessary to avoid a complete meltdown in 2008.",0,1420050418,null,0,false,0,cnai8g3,t3_2qutow,t1_cnai8g3,t1_cnadj7g,null,1425129048,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

If you break the law to such an extent that you go to jail then you've not lived up to this responsibility so lose your right to vote.

It is a fair enough statement to make, however, prisoners are still having to live and in a way operate within our society, even if cut off from it.  They should have a (maybe limited) say in it.

Once released they will have to live with the result of that election, so they should have an input into the outcome.

Also, there are many many things that affect prisoners that they ought to be able to have a voice in. I doubt MPs would start running campaigns based on reducing sentences for some crimes to secure votes, but if the pledged to secure funding for education services in prison, that would certainly benefit both parties.

Not to mention the things outside of prison that may affect their families, or their children that they may want a say in, whether it be education or health care.  Part of a thing a parent has to do is be a voice for their child up until 18. If that parent can't vote, that child doesn't have a voice either.

You'll understand then that I found it quite heartening when some months ago IA made a video saying that he was stepping back from the GG scene, apparently because people weren't going after 'SJWs' hard enough, and GamerGate at large told him in no uncertain terms to fuck off.



I find it hard to have much sympathy for GamerGate but I think the 'misogynist hate movement' angle is largely overstated, and claims that it's a right wing neo-reactionary movement can be easily disproved also. Equally though, when the movement's sympathisers claim that ""GamerGate hasn't harassed anyone!"", they may be partly right, but they're also being disingenuous – it's quite provable that people on the GamerGate side (or at the very least people sympathetic to GamerGate) have been engaging with people on the other side in a less than respectful tone, and in a few (albeit very rare) cases outright stalking them.

Jonjo is strong, but his three fundamental flaws are places where I think Carroll does well: defensive work ethic, positioning and composure. 

What screwed us against Liverpool was that he was playing higher than Siggy at times leaving us exposed and then half-assed his marking. Carroll plays deeper, which would have done a lot to stifle some of Liverpool's counters by virtue of being a body in defense. Additionally, Carroll is not a threat to get a red card every moment of every game. That is an enormous liability. I don't care how nice his long shot is if he can't play a game without deserving to get sent off. Additionally, I do believe that despite his weakness Carroll would have marked better and tracked back better. Most of defending isn't about making a tackle, its about having a body in the right place. Shelvey's two massive mistakes were not pressuring Lallana on the third goal and losing focus then heading it into his own net. Carroll wouldn't have made a perfect slide tackle to prevent Lallana, but simply chasing would have prevented Lallana from cutting left. Also I don't see Carroll heading it into our net when Fabianski is screaming behind him.

All this conversation is a bit meaningless though because in reality Ki should have been in there over either of them. However in a big game like this I choose the safer option rather than rolling the dice on Shelvey. This is simply my opinion and I apologize if it offends you!",0,1420051817,null,0,false,0,cnaj0bg,t3_2qr3h4,t1_cnaj0bg,t1_cnaibq4,null,1425128691,1,false,swanseacity,t5_2tip4,1

If you want Balotelli to press like Liverpool do, then that might be a problem because 1) He's low on confidence because he hasn't scored and he's very much a confidence type player, unlike Suarez, for example. And 2) He hasn't been to a club before that requires him to press. It takes time to perfect pressing and learning triggers and signals. After our start this season, the manager probably hasn't focused much on that but has his mind on other things.

We don't play like how Atletico Madrid or Chelsea play, which is everyone behind the ball, in your own half, defending very narrow and forcing the ball on the wings for them to cross and you to head away. If we did, I can almost guarantee that this tag that Balotelli has gained for being lazy would almost certainly go. (And we would be much better defensively!)

I also do think that people jump on the 'Balotelli is lazy' bandwagon when everything is going wrong and he's been given an awful amount of criticism.

He doesn't read his opponent's next step as well as other players might so he usually runs to the ball when it is too late to catch the player and by the time he reaches that player they have made a pass to another player so he stops running as it becomes another player's job to press the ball.

Suarez was a great example of reading his opponents. He not only read their next moves but next mistakes for example when he anticipated the bad header from Gerrard in the World Cup.

Bentaleb is everything people liked about Sandro without the injury baggage and the brainfarts positionally. He should be our holding midfielder for the forseeable future. When we put him in the left sided CM role (which Poch always asks to be farther forward than the right) he has problems both going forward and then covering for Rose (who is far too adventurous). 

That's where Mason comes in. He reminds me of a young Joey Barton. He has an aggression and passion we need and leaves it all on the field every game. He's not Modric, but he plays his part. If we can improve upon him, and get a player with all that AND the passing range/shooting ability near that Modric level (Schneiderlin, hint hint), then we should go for it, but he'll still be a major contributor. 

Dembele is a good change the game player. When we need a calming influence in midfield, or a more imposing physical beast in there, he's really good. However he lacks the passing range to be in their for full 90s. The ball really slows down when he starts unfortunately.

Paulinho is disliked on this board, but Lampard was disliked for years at Chelsea until he hit his old age so I think he'll be fine. He has an eye for goal and pops up at the right time, even if Spurs fans think he's a ""passenger"" or the like. He's not a midfield general who bosses games like Modric, but neither was Frank. Frank is the model for him to follow. He can contribute and Poch knows it.

Stambo is fun. He's almost Sandro 2.0. You can watch him and fall in love. But he seems to be a bit of a flat track bully who can't quite do it against stronger opposition. It's early days for him yet though, so we'll see in the second half.

Capoue is the one CM in the group I don't think has a place. And it's not cause he's not talented, he has about everything you could want in a CM. But he doesn't give himself to the cause. He does his job relatively well, but we are a team, and team is about sacrifice. Is he willing to give everything and blow out a lung to get that last ditch tackle? Cause Bentaleb and Mason are.

If Lenny suggests racial bias, then he should tackle the BBC corporation, not the individual people who work at the news desk.

What is a ""white, male perspective"" of news anyway? A plane crashes in the ocean, there's a war on somewhere; does a ""white, male perspective"" change the reporting of these events?

&gt; [Lenny Henry] contributed pieces on young people playing jazz; the new approach to diversity in comics produced by DC, Marvel and others; Ukip; culture secretary Sajid Javid; and also a feature called “Firsts”, about some of the diverse, diasporic pioneers in the television and film industry.

Is that what a ""black, male perspective"" is about?  Don't white males also cover these sorts of things?

Most of the news is dominated by major world events. Lenny seems to be covering niche areas here. I'd classify these as ""young vs old"" instead of ""black vs white"".

1. indonesia is an island nation.  so, F for geography, among other things.  you throw around misstatements and misuse of words, and general incomprehension with complete oblivion to the fact you are doing so.  how can you not know indonesia is an island nation.

2. indonesia has one of the highest rising rates of rabies; it is everywhere in indonesia, including the tourist spots like bali. its rates are on a par with the asian continent, the worst in the world.

&gt;It's no accident that most rabies-free countries are islands:

3. most rabies free countries are not islands.   most of europe is rabies-free including france, belgium, the netherlands - areas which are characterised as crossroads in that region.

so let's do the summation:  1. you could not comprehend the original post, and wasted my time maintaining that i said thailand and india were islands. 2. you maintain britain is safe from rabies - despite someone dying here fairly recently of rabies - because it is an island, not because of its regulations.  this despite the fact that before regulations britain was overrun with rabies. 3. you use, but in fact do not know the meaning of in this of all contexts, the word 'vector'. 4.  you ignorantly and hilariously maintain indonesia is not an island.  5. you can't understand, despite the incredible rise of rabies in indonesia, why i would use that nation as an example, while the phillipines, also an island nation, after enacting stricter regulation is seeing a lowering of rates, to make my point.  6. you falsely maintain that rabies free nations are also mostly island nations - which is something, like the geogrpahy of indonesia, definitions of words, can be easily checked - and you didn't.

We have some personal input into adjusting the contents for the intended recipient at that time. Boxes are also made up to take into account dietary and religious needs. Extra donated items such as toiletries and baby supplies are distributed to people who need them. If you are in need please ask and ask again.

[Eron Gjoni, Boogie2988, Adam Baldwin, Mil Yiannopolous and two others were doxxed for various reasons](http://theralphretort.com/exclusive-milo-boogie-baldwin-apparently-doxxed/).

These women should have gone to the FBI, however, rather than taking a screen capture of it then reuploading it to encourage copycats.

I condemn harassment of any kind for any reason be it for a physical reason or holding an opinion, I really do.

He said this ""person of colour"" quote 3 or 4 times and I couldn't help but find it slightly annoying. Is it really so hard to say the words ""black"" or ""brown?"". If he goes to buy a black car from the dealership, does he ask the dealer for ""a car of colour""? I'm white. White is a colour. Does that make me a ""person of colour"" too?


Maybe it's just me, but I find it almost offensive that he was acting as if Amjad's skin colour was the elephant in the room that needed to be danced around.

What player(s) have impressed you most this season, why?
Lloris, We could genuinely have 8-15 pts less if he wasn't in goal.

What player(s) have failed to impress this season, why?
Townsend, Dembele, Paulinho and Kaboul. They all look even worse than they did last year.

What position on the pitch is the club STRONGEST in?
GK

What position on the pitch is the club WEAKEST in?
ST, We all know Kane is brilliant but we can't rely on him all season we need another out and out striker Soldado and Ade aren't good enough.

What transfers OUT need to happen next summer?
Ade, Soldado, Lennon/Townsend, Paulinho, Kaboul, Naughton, and Dembele

What transfers IN need to happen next summer?
Established ST, Schneiderlin and Shaqiri

The manager:
Do you believe Poch has been able to implement his system yet, why?
It's finally starting to click. High press, one-touch football around the box. We're still months off for it to be perfect but hopefully Poch can bring in the players he wants for the system.

The competitions:
Where do you see Spurs finishing in the league this season?
4th-7th
How do you see Spurs progressing in the domestic cups this season?
CoC runners-up, FA Cup 4th round
How do you see Spurs progressing in the Europa League this season?

&gt;__Frank James Lampard__ (born 20 June 1978) is an English professional [footballer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) who plays as a [central midfielder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_midfielder), [attacking midfielder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attacking_midfielder) or [defensive midfielder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_midfielder) for [Manchester City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.) on loan from [New York City FC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_FC). He is the all-time leading goalscorer for [Chelsea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.), where he played for 13 years,  and is considered by a number of journalists and football experts to be one of the best midfielders of his generation.    He has been described by previous record goal-scorer [Bobby Tambling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Tambling) and long-term teammate [John Terry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Terry) as Chelsea's greatest ever player.

If you couldn't vote after release I'd understand your POV but as you can your opinion is flawed. If prisoners have the right to vote what other rights should they get? Right to spend time out of prison soak in the freedom? The fact is they are convicted of a crime and so their rights are restricted as a result and if they don't like don't commit the crime.

false,threep03k64,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"I personally don't understand why prisoners would not be considered to be part of (civilised) society. To me I think it is important that prisoners are still considered to be participants in society because the justification and legal basis of imprisonment comes from that society; the right to punish therefore comes from the recognition that the person being punished is part of that society. Put a different way, I suppose my thought process is that imprisonment gains legitimacy from the recognition that the person being punished is part of the society whose rules he has broken.

A separate reason I believe prisoners should have the right to vote comes from my belief in the purpose of imprisonment (which I suspect you will disagree with on the basis of your opposition to giving prisoners the right to vote); to me, this is primarily rehabilitation. Rehabilitation would involve reintegrating prisoners back in our society, which I believe should not involve preventing people from voting should they wish to do so. A study in the US actually found a link between recidivism and voting, finding that 27% of those (with an arrest history) who didn't vote were arrested again, in comparison to 12% of those who did vote.**[1]** I understand that this doesn't show a link between the *right* to vote and increased criminality, but I think at the very least it is sufficient for me to believe that those who do wish to participate in society (via voting) should not be discouraged from it because it leads only to further alienation from society (which does not mesh with the ideals of rehabilitation).

A final thought is merely that the right to vote is the basis of democracy, and in all other circumstances the vote is considered a right, not a privilege. I understand that we in the UK have a rather different society to that in South Africa but I quite like the words of a judge in the South African case *August v Electoral Commission* **[2]** (a case that concerned prisoners and the right to vote):

*""The vote of each and every citizen is a badge of dignity and of personhood. Quite literally, it says that everybody counts. In a country of great disparities of wealth and power it declares that whoever we are, whether rich or poor ... we all belong to the same ... nation.""*

People such as Farage claim that giving prisoners the vote would diminish democracy, but I do not believe this is the case; I believe it risks obscuring social or economic reasons for the increased criminality of the lower classes and undermines the idea that (as said in the quote above) everybody counts. An interesting side note is that  a study in the US determined 7/10 felons would have supported the Democratic Party in the close-cut Floridian elections in 2000 (the election led to a recount which had George Bush win by a margin of 537 votes).**[3]**

I've just read over what I wrote and realise it is rather disjointed, but at the very least I hope it gives an insight into my own thoughts on why prisoners should not be denied the right to vote and therefore participate in our society.

I don't care if he's a legend (I know he is) but right now he's helping our only title rival.
