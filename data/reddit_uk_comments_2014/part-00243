 [**Share Incentive Plan**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share%20Incentive%20Plan): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;The Share Incentive Plan (the ‘SIP’) was first introduced in the UK in 2000. SIP's are an [HMRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMRC) (Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs) approved, tax efficient all employee plan, which provides companies with the flexibility to tailor the plan to meet their business needs. SIPs are becoming increasingly popular with companies that want to engage their workforce and recruit and retain key employees. From 6 April 2014, HMRC approval will no longer be required for a SIP to obtain tax benefits, instead an employer is required to self certify that the SIP meets the requirements of the relevant legislation. Accordingly from 6 April 2014, a SIP should no longer be referred to as an HMRC approved plan.

true,gary1994,rory,Rory,"That's not really what I was getting at.  Maybe ""interludes"" isn't the best word.  This is a new idea I've just started playing with, so I don't have it fully fleshed out yet.  I'm trying to get at changes of pace and tone, rhythms that occur in life, but don't seem to be well represented on the show.  I don't see them as stand alone episodes, but as integral to fully developing a story arc (or at least the characters).  I don't necessarily think they need to be full episodes, some might need to be, but others could be 5-10 minute minisodes.  The Night of the Doctor, the Pond Life minisodes, and The Bells of Saint John prequel are all examples of what I feel the show doesn't have enough of.

Let's take a closer look at my River song example, and place it in context of where it happened in the show.  The point where I would make some changes is series 7.  In series 5 the universe blew up, in series 6 Melody was taken from the Ponds and the Doctor was trying to avoid being assassinated, also time got all messed up at the end. 

It finished up with the Doctor and River getting married.  The Ponds are together and Melody is back with her family, all grown up.  We know in hindsight that the Doctor is about to lose this family and that he is about to get plunged back into the time war.  But for the moment there is order. It seems like a good time to slow things down for a bit and explore that.

What if Season 7 had begun with ""Assylum"" and *ended* with ""Angels"" and they had used the rest of the time to explore the Doctor as something of a family man.  At the end of the God Complex the Doctor appears to be leaving Amy and Rory behind, but that's not the only option.  He could choose to ""settle down"" a bit.  What if the episodes between Assylum and Angels were about the tension between Doctor's desire to be a part of a family and his desire to roam free (this was explored a bit in ""The Power of Three"").  It would have given us time to see him and River together as a married couple.  We could have compared his relationship to River with Rory and Amy's relationship.  We could have seen more of Amy's family.  Brian Williams could have been developed more.  How would he react to River?

You could still have adventures\**, but make them lower key, less world threatening.  You could even have a Doctor lite episode that focused on Amy, Rory, and Brian facing down some danger without the Doctor.  The idea that there really is no line between the Doctor's world and that of the Average Joes^TM could have been played with.   The big difference being that those that travel with the Doctor know the dangers, while the Average Joe doesn't.  I thought it was a nice touch that the Doctor lost the Ponds during a picnic in NYC's Central Park, not on another planet in the far future or distant past.

Of course the Doctor losing this family would be the beginning of the next period of chaos.  His meeting Clara Prime at the beginning of Series 8\* (in this scenario) would be the beginning of his journey back to order, but not the same order as before.

Anyway, like I said this is an idea I've just started playing with.  I'm still thinking it through.

\*I like the idea of having taken a full season to develop Clara Prime and then spending another full season on Tranzalor.  I feel like things are being rushed.

Scotland - Scottish Identity

Wales - Welsh Identity 

England - British Identity 

I know the government in England is a UK Government but most of its matters affect only England anyway.

It's a mutual thing, both sides feel excluded to a degree, the Government is going through with this whole 'British values' which again is only taking place in England, so even if this works by bridging the gap with minorities and natives it'll likely cause further disconnect here in Scotland and in Wales too I think because already a great deal of people here in Inverness just see the union flag as 'just another English flag'.

The UK Government whatever its reason seems to go out of it's way to ignore English-esque things, again here in Scotland every government building has a Union Flag AND a Saltire, doing the same in England with a St Georges Cross and a Union flag would also help.

Just little things like these go a long way to be removing the feeling of exclusion that some youths on all sides face, be it English or not because if the Goverment doesn't find an answer then I sense English nationalism will continue to rise which depending on your political spectrum is a good or bad thing.",0,1408521906,null,0,false,0,cjvdpt3,t3_2e0ute,t1_cjvdpt3,t1_cjvcldk,null,1435336062,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

No they aren't. Trust me, walk around Soho around closing time and tell me it's hard to find drugs.

&gt;I also do not buy into the argument that legalisation would necessarily cause illegal trade to cease. 


Of course it won't, no one is making that cliam. It will *reduce* the illegal trade. Look at bootleg alcohol and tobacco, it's still around but the *vast* majority of people buy from legal sources.

&gt;All that will likely happen is that the dealers will focus their attentions to underage selling, or undercutting the price of legal suppliers by bypassing such things as income tax, corporation tax or import fees. Some may even go so far as to counterfeit.


This already happens! Legalisation is supposed to improve the problem, not solve it completely.

We need to get it out of our heads that the drug problem can be solved, it can only be **treated**. Legalisation, to many, looks like the best way to reduce harm and help treat the problem.

I'm assuming that a Windows shop would use Windows or Hyper-V to host the OS. They could use an ESX server or XenServer - but that's not a solution if it's for desktops. So for desktops they go with a VDI solution - which all means more licenses.

&gt; 3 &amp; 4) Interesting again, there are at least two companies with the full Windows source code beyond Microsoft, one of them is Research Machines and I forget the name of the other. So yes, depending on who, exactly, you are you can do everything you've said you can't do

I don't think this is a credible refutation to the fact that a run-of-the-mill retail business can simply ask Microsoft for the source of the OS because they want to keep XP running a few more years. That is seriously not going to happen.

I can't even believe you tried to use this as an example to compare Windows to Linux - you are clutching at straws!

&gt; it depends on exactly how much money you throw at Microsoft.

Well done for taking my point, arguing against it, and using your own example to prove my point. FFS.

&gt; Which is exactly the same situation as a closed source Linux application isn't it? If you throw the vendor enough money they will do the heavy lifting or you can get your hands dirty.

Weren't we discussing the OS not the application?

Nevertheless, closed source vendors who use Linux are often very good at providing continual support - that is because Linux is not like Windows in that:

a) You don't pay for upgrades and

b) The OS is continually upgraded and patched, you don't have Linux XP, then have to throw out the whole codebase and install Linux 7, then do the same again for Linux 8. You can fork it, add backports for older components to support older applications etc....

My preferred solution is free speech.  Criticize and ridicule bad ideas.

Unfortunately, it's become socially unacceptable to point out the truth about Islam, which is that it's a backwards, warlike and misogynistic religion which, like every other religion, is wholly wrong in any non-trivial claim it makes about the universe.  It is also holding a billion of the world's population back in ignorance and poverty. 

Instead of telling Muslims the plain truth - which is that the secular west has come up with philosophical solutions which are superior in every way to those codified by the 8th century Saudi founders of Islam, we've opted to maintain useful lies.  We tell them that we consider Islam to be a great religion of peace and tolerance and that the battle we're seeing is between 'moderate' Islam and Islamism, which is a bit like saying that the battle against lung cancer is between moderate smokers and heavy smokers. 

Islam is one colossal bad idea which has outlived its time.   But bad ideas can be dropped.  They can be argued against.

true,PopeGregoryIX,eng-Cornwall,Kernow,"&gt;There are those who don’t think that rail subsidies are a problem and would rather the cost of rail travel be spread out across the taxpaying public than actual passengers. But contrary to what the London-centric chattering classes tend to assume, few people commute by train. Car and van drivers account for 49 per cent of all distance travelled, with their passengers accounting for another 28 per cent every year. Rail accounts for just 10 per cent.

Surely that's a circular argument if the reason that more people drive is that the trains are so expensive and don't go to half the places they need to. I know that I would use trains more if the system was better and cheaper. The telling thing would be to look at the equivalent figures for other countries operating different systems. e.g. Do enough people use the trains in Germany to justify public ownership?

Similarly: 

&gt;Rail passengers tend to be better off than the average taxpayer, which means that subsidies are regressive: the relatively poor are being taxed to pay for the relatively rich.

Rail passengers are richer because they have to be in order to afford to use the trains. If trains were cheaper, poorer people would be able to use them, wouldn't they? 

That isn't to say I agree or disagree with any or all of the points made. I just wanted to point out some of the logical fallacies used to make them.

Those risks have been demonstrated clearly in the euro area over recent years, with sovereign debt crises, financial fragmentation and large divergences in economic performance. The euro area is now beginning to rectify its institutional shortcomings, but further, very significant steps must be taken to expand the sharing of risks and pooling of fiscal resources.

The method of murder and semantics used by popular press to describe the murder are largely unimportant details; murder is murder and it is wrong whoever the perpetrators are. Mohammed Saleem was murdered by a thug with neo-Nazi sympathies. [Looking at a list of terrorist actions in the UK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terrorist_incidents_in_Great_Britain#2010-present), Irish republican terrorism and neo-Nazi terrorism are equally as problematic. 

It's also difficult to term Islamic extremism as being a prevalent problem in the UK, since it only takes a handful of individuals. Anders Breivik killed 77 people, and it only took one lone gunman. Likewise, the London bombings only took 4 perpetrators acting in a lone cell. In the sense that the UK has a problem with Islamic extremism, do the actions of one man mean that Norway has a problem with neo-Nazism?

Islamic extremism is a problem, but ascribing a large portion of what is wrong with our society to that alone is wrong.

Honestly, the government is being fucking childish! Scotland have done as much to build the pound as we have and I don't think people even realise how bad for our economy this break would be, if it is not on amicable terms. Do you have any idea how much of our produce comes from Scotland?

As a northerner, I totally understand why Scotland is sick of our government and want their autonomy. Especially when you consider the shit house Tory bastards we have right now.

My wife is Scottish and my in-laws are somewhat split on the matter but the Tory government are not helping at all! This petulant throwing of toys from the government pram is a joke.

Economically, cornwall is a basket case. If it were a horse, it would be kinder to take it around the back of a stable and shoot it.

Cornwall is poor as hell, ironically reliant on EU funding for extremely poor areas of countries. If tourism, shaky at the best of times, dried up, then there would be precious little other than some farming but thats erratic at best and still dependent on subsidies.

There was some talk a few years ago about re-introducing tin mining as an industry as industry regulations forbade lead in solder, replacing it with tin, but the initiative fell flat on its face as the company went into administration last year.

I think Salmond is actually saying that we haven't negotiated anything yet (and the British government was adamant that it wouldn't negotiate anything prior to the vote) and therefore suggesting something was off the table before we start is idiotic.

Even if there was shared control over the pound, the level of that 'control' would be a negotiating point as well.  If they said that they wanted one of the nine members of the BoE monetary policy committee, then that is going to be ok if we get some sort of concession from them too.

If the major worry is that the country ends up in too much debt and a central bank has to bail them out, well that has only happened once in the last twenty years and it was caused by London Banks.

It still comes down to looking at assaults, harassment and the like. The same evidential difficulties apply as before when you have crimes with no other evidence than the victims say so.

If conviction numbers have gone up, it's arguably more to do with more reporting of incidents.  Officers now tend to routinely photograph the state of the house, injuries etc; but that's more to do with technology that allows this than any specific training.

It enables extremists like this to think 'They admit there's a god, they've just got the specifics of god wrong.'

Do you have any idea what that means for the value of the pound? Foreign investors will lose big time, with some suggesting that there would be a pre-emptive ""run"" on such investments to get them out of the country. Which also exasperates the exchange rate issues further. rUK is not stupid, they know this.

The value of the Pound would weaken without Scotland but not to the alarmist extent you've portrayed here. Remember that Scotland also imports so the equation won't be as dramatically changed as the Yes campaign are suggesting. Additionally there are advantages to a weaker currency, namely a boost for exporters. The reason why the SNP want a currency union is because without one they risk their own currency being very strong on the back of oil exports which will cause Scottish exports to suffer.

No. Well not exactly. It's there to provide emergency liquidity but such a scenario is not always indicative of a unstable economy or is there only to provide bailouts. Theoretically it's purpose is to prevent bank runs but ensuring a otherwise stable bank faces a temporary short-fall that would mean it cannot immediately honour deposits which would cause a bank run/death spiral. Practically such an assurance helps prevent such runs because people know it's there.

&gt; In a currency union rUK would only ""bail out"" Scotland if it were in their mutual interest. The EU is already taking the stance that such cross-nation bailouts are essential in the modern world. Financial issues are no longer limited to one country because of the high level of cross-border trade.

Being neighbourly is allowing things like free and easy trade, spending billions of pounds helping a country out of financial ruin. 

Again this is of course hypothetical but rUK has to protect itself from that possibility. If Scotland wants all the protection and benefits that arise from being in the UK then they must stay in the UK.

RBS - a Scottish bank based in Edinburgh received 22% of the total money the UK spent bailing out banks. According to my second source and google, the Scottish economy by even the most generous estimate (including all oil basically) is only 10.2% of the total UK GDP. So an independent Scotland would have been twice as exposed to the banking crisis as the rest of the UK.

I also wanted to take my bike with me so we could do some cycling. To buy the ticket on the day, it'd cost me £72 return. I think I looked at tickets around 2 weeks in advance, if I wanted to leave at 7am in the morning and leave at 9pm a night (I didn't) it was going to cost me £45 return, otherwise it was well over £50.

In both cases I was going to have to ride my bike across London with my bags (about 12 miles to get to where I wanted to go) because you can't take a bike on the tube.

So instead I drove my car, a small diesel - it easily gets 70 mpg on the motorway, more if I try. I worked out I spent under £30 on fuel and another £6 on the Severn bridge. I also arrived at my mate's flat and could leave when I wanted. Why the fuck is a train more expensive than driving when it's so much more inconvenient?

Even if I priced it at 20p a mile (which is how my work would reimburse me for using my own car), it's cheaper than the return ticket on the day. If I'd had someone coming with me it would've been completely stupid to even think about taking the train.

Something is clearly wrong with pricing here and this is the norm, all of my friends in other cities drive to visit each other.

true,seoi-nage,null,null,"&gt; Where there is a forward reservation for cyclists, use it.

I disagree with this. Use your discretion. 

I often see people filtering through small gaps, in order to get to the forward reservation. If the light turns green and the traffic starts moving while the cyclist is filtering, then the cyclist is left in a rather dangerous no-man's land. 

Furthermore, if the road is fairly clear and the traffic is moving faster than you, then what do you gain by filtering to the reservation? Those cars that you just filtered past are only going to overtake you again.

Often I think it is better to simply stop at the back of the queue of traffic and take the primary position. If you're confident of getting through when the lights turn green, then you haven't lost anything.

Reasons to consider filtering to the forward reservation would be: (1) The queue is big enough that you won't get through the next green if you stop at the back; (2) You are familiar with the lights and you are confident that you can get to the reservation before they turn green *and* there are large enough gaps for you filter through; (3) You are generally moving faster than the traffic and therefore your entire journey is one of filtering. When you are filtering to the reservation, ensure that you have a back-up plan in case the lights turn green before you get there, e.g. make sure that there are gaps between consecutive cars in the lane, into which you can merge and take primary before the cars start moving.

Finally it goes without saying that you should never, ever, be tempted to filter up the inside of an HGV, no matter how attractive the forward reservation looks. ",0,1408530646,null,0,false,0,cjvfcay,t3_2e0pxw,t1_cjvfcay,t1_cjuxqjw,null,1435337146,4,false,londoncycling,t5_2wcdj,4

The fact that there was some people who supported it does not detract from the fact that the Parliament in England blocked the trade of Scottish goods in England, thus preventing Scotland from raising money to fill the hole left by the failed panama colony. The idea that the Act of Union was supported by the vast majority of the Scottish parliament, let alone the vast majority of Scots at the time, is simply not true. The Scottish parliament voted for the union not out of some love of England or because we shared a monarch (lots of countries shared and share a monarch but still remain independent), but because England had us by the Short and Curlies.
2. The fact that James the VI and I was Scottish is irrelevant. The Act of Union was not carried out by him but by Anne. William the III was Dutch, but I don't see that fact being relevant. The fact James the VI/I became King of Scotland and England does not mean Scotland took over England, not by far. As I said in point one, many monarchs had multiple kingdoms, but they still remained independent. James was a wise king, he knew that it was best to keep the Kingdoms separate rather than try and unify them into one, and he did just that. Previous Monarchs have also been German and French, but it doesn't add wind to the sails of an argument for unification with those countries.

I'm not being anti English. I'm part English myself and my Dad, who was born in England is voting yes. I'm just telling the truth: England shut the border to Scots goods after the news of the colony failure reached them which prevented Scotland from making money to fill the gap in their finances.

You seem to think I'm saying that there's no work involved or Open Source is free and you seem to keep using this line of reasoning as if to defeat my point. IT is a cost, *everything* is a cost. The job of a competent IT director is to keep this cost at a minimum and balance the investments to keep the business competitive.

If it's about the amount of work involved, I'm not suggesting migrations are not a ball-ache... there's work that goes into supporting every platform - that's why you hire sysadmins and developers and you get people to properly document their work!

Which leads to TCO: hiring a sysadmin (or even a team of sysadmins) is going to be cheaper than paying for 1-year only of extended support - and then still paying the migration cost - *to a similar platform that is going to recreate the issue in 5-10 years!*

Open (not necessarily free) platforms are capable of in-house support (and therefore in most cases cheaper) whereas proprietary platforms are not. You can't win on this argument unless you are trying to factor in loss-leaders and use one-off case studies to make tenuous supporting arguments that this is some how standard practice.

edit: If you had spent any amount of time in an investment bank you would see a common behavior of setting up teams to try and replicate the business function of proprietary software they have bought all the time... because TCO is cheaper in-house when you hire your own developers and sysadmins. This doesn't mean they're not using Windows desktops, but this is mostly due to the fact that desktop users are familiar with Windows and the culture shock would be too great to convert a global organisation employing hundreds of thousands to a Linux desktop.

So, *purely from the perspective of the rest of the UK:*

 * Firstly, Scotland is the 2nd largest trading partner of the rest of the UK, so cross-borer transaction fees between currencies can be avoided by a shared currency. Of course, if Scotland goes the ""Sterlingisation"" route, this isn't an issue, but forcing Scotland to use Sterling outside of a formal union means that Scotland will likely make a faster transition to a new currency, putting these transaction costs in place.

 * Secondly, Scotland would have no more an influence on monetary policy than it does now; which is to say, none. There will never be a monetary decision made in the interests of Scotland that isn't also in the interests of the rest of the UK. And if there is a decision to be made in the interests of the UK that isn't in the interests of Scotland, then it'll be made regardless.

 * Thirdly, the UK would really like to see Trident and its nukes stay at Faslane and Coulport until its end of life in 2028. Only the truly blinkered on both sides of the debate won't take a step back and realise that there will be negotiations around this.

 * Fourthly, Scotland is the only part of the UK that's a net exporter, so the UK's balance of payments (and therefore Sterling) takes a hit if Scotland adopts its own currency. As with the first point, this isn't an issue if Scotland uses the pound outside a formal agreement, but this probably leads Scotland to make a quicker transition to a new currency. The more likely Scotland is to adopt a new currency rather than use Sterling outside a formal currency union, the more it becomes in the interests of the rest of the UK to have a formal union in place.
 * Finally, there's an opportunity within a formal currency union to put constraints on Scottish fiscal policy, such as preventing a Scottish government undercutting the UK on corporation tax, and agreeing on spending and borrowing limits to help the Sterling economic area remain stable and reduce the risk of a bailout ever being needed.

I'm not saying that demands covering all these things would be agreed to around the negotiating table, a balance would need to be struck.

Thank you for digging up the figures.

It is extremely difficult to figure out exactly how much something ""costs the public"", whether we're talking about roads, railways or the NHS. For example, how do you factor in the cost of emissions from road vehicles in terms of public health? If you do that, you have to also factor in the emissions from trains (or the power stations that supply them).  It all gets complicated quite quickly.

Is it reasonable to subsidise public transport by taxing private transport? If so, to what extent? Which modes of public transport should get priority? These are all complicated questions with no obviously-correct answer.

From my point of view, I'm absolutely happy that my taxes go towards subsidising rail travel, because I'd much rather people take the train from London to Scotland than drive. I'd also note that I'd very very much prefer freight to go by rail than by lorry, because lorries destroy roads quickly but railway lines are designed for transporting heavy loads - not to mention the higher energy efficiency.

So I suppose it's all in your point of view.

There is an element of society who call in frequently expecting the police to run their lives for them... They aren't abused, or even particularly abusive themselves; they just seem to have never grown up and use the emergency services like occasional parents to make decisions they don't want to.

This is a minority in terms of volume of individual callers; however it forms a great proportion of the work volume.

As frequent callers, they learn the words to say on the phone, so you go out and solve the petty dispute, then do a 20+ page form and move on.  If it's a bloke causing this, it's invariably easier to knock it on the head at this point; if it's the female caller it's sometimes a little harder.

I have to pick that out, because I feel irony like that should be recognised.

Whilst I agree in public subsidy for infrastructure projects (rail, road, air!) I still find it odd that you are trying to make it sound as if motorists aren't paying for this.

I mostly cycle, take the tube, and drive a little bit, 6,000 miles a year on average get done in my car.  It has to be acknowledged that many motorists end up paying for the subsidies of others, that's fine but many of them have no benefit from this, and are not at the richer end of society.  For me it's easy to not take my car, I'm able bodied and in London everything is in easy to cycle distance, and I've showers everywhere via gym membership.  I have choice.

But many of those who foot the subsidy bill do not.  I don't think that building mass rail in Cornwall makes sense.  I think working with manufacturers of cars to provide charging infrastructure makes a lot more sense.  But I'm a fan boy of Ellon Musk so...

I think we should be making much better cycling infrastructure.  Cycling is brilliant, it's cheap and it's a gift that gives back to you in health benefits, my fractured arm this month not withstanding.

Our current system is quite regressive. I choose a very efficient engine, I pay no VED, no C-charge, and happily get 70+ mpg this is despite being a higher rate tax payer.  Meanwhile, someone else who (wisely in my view) doesn't want to spend more than a months wage on a car, ends up with a much less efficient thing, gets 30mpg, pays VED, pays C-charge..",0,1408532650,null,0,false,0,cjvfqeh,t3_2e29et,t1_cjvfqeh,t1_cjvfls4,null,1435337424,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

For example a country like Japan has comparatively cheap rail (barring high speed trains) and almost all of the train lines in cities and urban areas are privatised with absolutely zero government subsidy. 

This is because the private rail companies had to compensate for lack of subsidisation by diversifying a bit and investing in real estate (particularly around their train lines) - and they often own the huge shopping complexes at rail hubs too. Rail is just one facet of their business model. 

Because these companies are more interested in maintaining the communities around their core businesses, their focus is to keep a high level of performance at a competitive price rather than just looking for raw profit.

“I remember one time when we went to play Kazan in the Champions League. In that match I had all my strikers injured. No Diego Milito, no Samuel Eto’o, I was really in trouble and Mario was the only one.

“Mario got a yellow card in the 42nd minute, so when I got to the dressing room at half-time I spend about 14 minutes of the 15 available speaking only to Mario.

“I said to him: ‘Mario, I cannot change you, I have no strikers on the bench, so don’t touch anybody and play only with the ball. If we lose the ball no reaction. If someone provokes you, no reaction, if the referee makes a mistake, no reaction.'

“The 46th minute – red card!”

Italian U-21 manager Pierluigi Casiraghi said, “Seeing a lad of his talent who at 18 behaves like this both with the national team and his club is infuriating.” 

Then Inter manager José Mourinho remarked “He has a single brain cell, he's impossible to work with.""

true,john_locke1689,,Belfast. Mayonnaise.,"&gt; What would be the anthem of this new State?

&gt;Perhaps a new anthem could be written, the present one actually has very violent lyrics and ""Ireland's Call"" used in All-Ireland rugby doesn't really sound nice for a national anthem. Regardless, an anthem would be least of one's worries. 

I actually quite like Ireland's call, its quite rousing.

&gt;  Would this new Country keep the Tricolour or replace it?

&gt;Keep the Greed, White and Orange, it is a flag which was designed to account for major traditions and religions on the island. 

Haha Greed, aside from the fact it is a flag used by people who brutally attacked and murdered people throughout Ireland but particularly in Ulster, and then used by a parliament who [celebrate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Aiken) those murderers its not going to fly.


&gt; Would this Country use a federal system?

&gt;Most likely a federal system. One idea might be to have 4 states; the State of Ulster, the State of Leinster, the State of Connacht and the State of Munster plus a separate federal district which deals with all-Ireland affairs. The federal district may be Dublin County, or perhaps maybe a brand new district carved out in the centre of the country as a federal district contained a brand new Irish federal capital, with federal government and federal houses of parliament. Creating a new capital might help to ease the stigma of ""Dublin rule"" many loyalist have. Another idea might be to have dual-capitals; Dublin and Belfast would each become federal districts with the Lower House of Parliament being in Dublin and the Upper House of Parliament (Senate) being in Belfast and other administrative duties shared between both cities. 

The issue with federal districts is that the inhabitants there are second class citizens, they would need to be separate city state type places within the federal system, to prevent a DC type situation. But then that brings up issues of it being separated from interstate politics.


&gt; Would a new police force be created or would the PSNI be integrated into an Garda Síochána?

&gt;Maybe. Or you could each of the federal states having control of their own police forces: Garda Ulster, Garda Leinster, Garda Connacht and Garda Munster plus federal police for the federal district(s).

Garda Ulster? Nope


&gt; What Corporation Tax system would the country use?

Probably a low corporation tax as the Republic now has. It's vital for helping Ireland, as a small European country, to compete against larger European economies. Low corporate tax is someone the Republic holds very dear. 

&gt; Would University be free?

University would be mostly free. In the Republic at the minute, a free fee scheme exists though students have to pay the university's registration fee. The registration fee is typically ~€2,000 but, depending on your income, you can get this all paid for you plus receive a maintenance grant. 

&gt; Would this country join the Commonwealth?

&gt;It's unlikely, but there are some politicians (most of whom in Fine Gael) who are open to the idea. Besides, what use is there exactly in joining the Commonwealth? If it's something that makes the loyalists happy, then I don't see how it would be much harm, as long as the British Monarch does not become the Irish Head of State. 

There's the fabulous games and stronger links with developing nations. Europe can't stay top dog indefinitely.

&gt; What law system would be used? and on and on.

&gt;A common law system based on the one which exists in the Republic at present. The legal system in the Republic in itself is very much based on the one in the UK.

If we are using a federal system NI could keep its own system, the issue is integrating case laws, you would essentially have to start anew.",0,1408535202,null,0,false,0,cjvgaj8,t3_2dzg59,t1_cjvgaj8,t1_cjvbtfk,null,1435337731,-3,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,-3

Heavily taxing the use of private cars is also justified by the negative externalities that are not normally factored into the cost of car ownership, such as pollution and concomitant costs, road policing, injuries and fatalities, etc. In most of the UK the cost of car storage is socialised: you don't have to pay rent to park your car on the public road outside your house (obviously, some areas have introduced residents' permit systems and I think that's a great idea).

Where can I buy a car for a month's wage and come away with something other than a bucket of rusty bolts!?

Suarez was worth the trouble, he was a good influence in training and gave everything on the pitch.

Ballotelli is a bad influence around the club and has little runs of influence on the pitch and then disappears for chunks of the season.

BR will be the greatest man-manager of all time if he could realise Ballotelli's potential but that just isn't going to happen.

The fuel source was relatively cheap coal and regularly-located water towers.

Now the lines are old, the trains run substantially faster and require an extensive and complicated over-head electrical supply. Signals are automated and extensively networked to cope with a much higher usage from a growing population.

Engineering faults, when they happen, must be resolved in minutes or hours rather than days due to the quantity of journeys they could potentially disrupt, and the people required to do this urgent work (which often involves high voltages) are expensive to employ. 

The other staff who construct and operate the network are likewise significantly more expensive to employ (relative to the wealth of the passengers) then they were back in the Victorian era. The rolling stock itself is also substantially more pricey due to the relative labour and higher engineering requirements (safer, faster, etc.).

Edit: Just to expand on the sort of cash that last-minute high voltage work can cost; I once paid a HV guy a few grand to come out to a machine install at a factory when it became clear that the entire HV system would need to be taken down (because of the age of the factory) to make the final connections to the LV.

if you take the US as an example why 'moderate' is a bullshit phrase.

In Cali you have liberals - pro gay, pro choice, pro civil liberties, pro science etc pretty everything that defines liberal. Pretty much like modern Britain.

Then you have the bible belt - anti-gay, pro-life, slightly racist, anti science etc.

Lastly you have the Westbro Baptist Church - nutters for christ.

Compared to westbro the more bigoted homophobic racist anti-science evangelicals could be called 'moderate' Christians (the CoE would be considered liberal in this instance) but there is nothing moderate about them, not for British values anyway.


The term moderate is used as a shield to avoid scrutiny and criticism and it needs to stop.  If it is to be used, it has to be used compared agnostic liberal Britain.

They are also going to be a new and unproven nation. Their first job will be to convince global business leaders and politicians that they are a serious and professionally governed nation that is prepared to play by the rules everyone else plays by. 

On the flip side, it is very easy for David Cameron to get on the phone and speak directly to global leaders like Barrack Obama, Angela Merkel. They already have established working relationships, but moreover entire UK government departments (like the Foreign Office) have both official and unofficial connections to important players around the world. It will be easy for the British to exert their influence whereas it will take decades for the Scots to build it.

The point is, it's easy for the UK to use its diplomatic connections to apply pressure on a newly independent Scotland to achieve the concessions the rUK wants. It also just so happens that UK interests tend to be aligned with US interests... the UK wants to keep the Faslane base because it cannot afford to unilaterally relocate it overnight, and other destinations will not be as geographically suitable as the Clyde. US interests are for the UK to continue to have a strong anti-submarine warfare presence in the north Atlantic particularly along the GIUK gap - a strategic stretch of water which can be used to constrain Russian access and influence to the North Atlantic ocean. This is even more relevant now since the US has shifted to a 60:40 split with its own naval assets favoring the Pacific... the US needs France and the UK (as the EUs two largest defense players) to pick up the slack that it can no longer afford to provide... and that means keeping Faslane operational. 

So if Scottish politicians try to play firm with Faslane, chances are they are going to have US politicians and key US industries telling them they will pull investment away from Scotland if they play silly buggers about Trident. In a carrot-and-stick approach they will probably also pledge to help encourage Scottish access to the EU and other important institutions with their substantial influence if they concede to having Trident remain on the Clyde for the time being.",0,1408537275,null,0,false,0,cjvgtut,t3_2e231g,t1_cjvgtut,t1_cjvfozl,null,1435338161,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15

&gt;

&gt;__Spring-heeled Jack__ is an entity in [English folklore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_folklore) of the [Victorian era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era). The first claimed sighting of Spring-heeled Jack was in 1837.  Later sightings were reported all over [Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain) and were especially prevalent in suburban [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London), the [Midlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midlands_(England\)) and [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland). 

&gt;There are many theories about the nature and identity of Spring-heeled Jack. This [urban legend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_legend) was very popular in its time, due to the tales of his bizarre appearance and ability to make extraordinary leaps, to the point that he became the topic of several works of fiction.

&gt;Spring-heeled Jack was described by people who claimed to have seen him as having a terrifying and frightful appearance, with diabolical physiognomy, clawed hands, and eyes that ""resembled red balls of fire"". One report claimed that, beneath a black cloak, he wore a helmet and a tight-fitting white garment like an [oilskin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oilskin). Many stories also mention a ""Devil-like"" aspect. Others said he was tall and thin, with the appearance of a [gentleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentleman). Several reports mention that he could breathe out blue and white flames and that he wore sharp metallic claws at his fingertips. At least two people claimed that he was able to speak comprehensible English.

&gt;The two current duchies in England are the Duchy of Cornwall and the Duchy of Lancaster. Unlike historic duchies, these are no longer coextensive with a distinct geographic area, though they originate in the palatine counties of Cornwall and Lancaster.

The majority of the estate lies elsewhere, with half being on Dartmoor in Devon.

The estate reported a profit of over £7,800,000 for the year ending March 31, 2002.

&gt;The Duchy of Lancaster owns approximately 46,500 acres (188 km2) including Lancaster Castle and is administered by a Chancellor.

&gt;In most of the UK the cost of car storage is socialised: you don't have to pay rent to park your car on the public road outside your house (obviously, some areas have introduced residents' permit systems and I think that's a great idea).

This is what living outside of London makes you think.  Myself I own a lease for the land my car sits on.  Outside, it's permit holders only.  But what's really difficult is visitors can't even pay.  This means my disabled mother sometimes struggles to visit me.  A blue badge does not let you park there after all.

It makes it very hard to visit friends, as parking is often over £2 per hour (£2.20 outside a friends place) just helping them move a TV cost £4.40 in fees, as the flat they were moving too was a different zone, so another unit of time had to be bought!

&gt; Where can I buy a car for a month's wage and come away with something other than a bucket of rusty bolts!?

Given that the scrap value of most cars is £500, the bangers just tend to get scrapped.  Most people I know wisely do not spend more than a months wage on car, it's just a case of how long you expect it to run without more costs.

&gt; Motorists (like all taxpayers) are paying for the railways. IMO they should be paying more.

But why?  It's great for me, I've got a tube line a 5 min walk from my home, 30 second walk from the office.  I've got a mainline train a 10 min bus ride (buses always every 15 min, even at 3am, much more frequent during the day) or a different tube line 15 min.  My parents in Cornwall?  It's a bit further to go, nearest station is a good few miles away, with a poor bus service.  The only option is car.  The roads are not congested, there is little traffic, parking is easy.

It wouldn't be efficient to build a rail system to meet their needs.

Cars are getting better at being less environmentally awful, the car I bought them has double the MPG of their old one that failed (gear box).  I'd imagine in 5 years time I'll be able to buy them an electric one in Tesla make good on their plans.

Within my lifetime the idea of letting people manually drive a car will hopefully be a thing of the past, it's almost like the joke about the cockpit of the future, pilot and a dog, the job of the dog is to bite the pilot if he touches anything.

One of the reasons motoring is so cheap, such a social liberator is just how efficient it is.  Just look at what you can buy for £15k today, compared to what you could buy for £15k 10 years ago, despite inflation, you get much more bang for buck.  They are so damned reliable, servicing so cheap.  I needed a new rear wiper, it's a click on thing, changed in 30 seconds, £8 for the branded wiper.  Ask how much it costs to change one for a train operator.

My biggest opposition to motoring is congestion and environment, modern cars are rapidly helping with the latter, and the former I think is often best solved with promoting cycling, even if they are electric assist.",0,1408537606,null,0,false,0,cjvgxcw,t3_2e29et,t1_cjvgxcw,t1_cjvgfm8,null,1435338215,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

In general, act as though you're invisible.
What this means is, they can't see you. You'll have the hi vis on, lights are on, and they'll look you in the eye and pull out. Be ready.

Specifically, always always position yourself between vehicles when you cross an intersection. Be part of the traffic. Don't pass anyone, don't let anyone pass you.

And yeah, you're a road user, so you should follow the rules.

One last tip; really scrutinise your route on a map; London roads look like a bowl of dropped spaghetti, I'm always finding a new wriggle here and there, infuriates my wife when we go for a ride with all the left right left right manouvres, but I love finding a quiet route away from the bastard traffic.

I'm a UK (usually london based) bisexual student, very interested in LGBT politics and spend too much time on Reddit. As an interested redditor I also have plenty of experience with the particular challenges around reddit that come with the LGBT communities (i.e. all the various grievances, phobias, discriminations and viewpoints that make them contentious), and I'm confident I could deal with any issues diplomatically. I've been a redditor for a little over one year (this being my second account, I can provide screencaps as evidence if you're worried about inexperience with reddit).

I've been subscribed to bisexualUK for a while (was not aware the other existed), but haven't seen much activity. I'd like to try to raise awareness, maybe get a mod team together to get some content flowing and build a user base. Obviously this isn't easy, they're both aimed at quite niche demographics (esp. biUK), but I'd like to try.

&gt; Externalities  
&gt;47.  The Campaign for Better Transport extrapolates from the Government research on marginal external costs (above) to reach a total cost of externalities of £70 billion-£95 billion per annum at today's prices.[45] Again, the major component of this is congestion. The Campaign for Better Transport also argues that it is impossible to try to price all externalities—such as severance of communities and loss of tranquillity. And according to the Campaign to Protect Rural England and Natural England, the monetary values for landscape and loss of countryside have not been calculated.

Additionally relative cost of motoring has significantly decreased compared to other transports.

true,BraveSirRobin,null,null,"&gt; The value of the Pound would weaken without Scotland but not to the alarmist extent you've portrayed here. 

I'm not saying it's going to crash but even a predictable 1% drop will cause investors to bail which creates a positive feedback loop encouraging others. It won't drop more than a few percent and it will recover most of it's value but there will be a net loss for the UK in the process. 

&gt;  Additionally there are advantages to a weaker currency, namely a boost for exporters.

The Thatcher government's core Deflationary Strategy was designed to strengthen the pound to make it a good investment choice. While it would be temporarily good for what little exports we have left it won't be good for the much larger financial services industry. Which is much closer to Westminster's heart than a factory in Yorkshire. 

&gt; And you seem to be believing people advocating for Yes.

I always look into everything from all sides before forming an opinion. I trust no one, every media source has bias. Everything I'm saying can be easily verified. 

&gt;  Look up lender of last resort. 

I think you should, I've already covered that in another thread. tl;dr: not what you think it is, it exists to prop up an economy because a crash would be far worse. It's a very old idea from a time where economies were more isolated and every country had a unique currency. If all users of that currency have problems then the currency has a problem. The pound is not affected by the Scottish government being unable to pay debts because they aren't the ""owner"" of the pound. It still has it's value to every other user and frankly we are a small minority. If the Portuguese government were unable to pay their bills it would not directly affect the Euro. What is being promoted by those quoting this sound bite doesn't not stand up to basic scrutiny. The greater risk is rUK crashing and bringing down Scotland, which would happen regardless of what currency either were using because of the strong trade relationships. 

If Scotland crashed while the rUK is still strong (which by the way is laughable as we'd be 4 places above you in the OECD GDP tables) it's not necessary unless rUK decides that the damage to the Scottish economy represents a risk to rUK in terms of losing a market to trade with.

They would sink in stormy waters, and the fatigue on their small hulls would make them expensive to maintain. Their only use would be in patrolling the fishing waters in and around Scottish waters.

The SNP white paper suggests they believe they can also bargain for two [Type-23 Frigates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_23_frigate). The UK has 13 of this type still in service though the oldest is now about 25 years old and starting to look pretty rough around the edges, and is *planned* to be replaced around 2023 (However it is quite common for ship replacements to happen ahead of the planned schedule to save on costs). The UK is looking to replace the class with a newer more flexible [Type 26](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_26_Global_Combat_Ship) model over the next decade or so, but only plans to buy 8 vessels initially.

The SNP defense whitepaper was generally dismissed by serious defense analysts, even impartial ones from other countries. For example they plan to base their fleet out of Faslane... however Faslane is s submarine maintenance facility, with limited capacity for surface ships. It would need extensive works to reconfigure it for this purpose at a considerable cost. It's also unclear how beneficial two obsolete frigates would be without the armaments and munitions infrastructure needed to make them anything more than oversized yachts... most of which is located at Portsmouth and Devonport in Plymouth.

On a side note, the first steel is going to be cut for the new Type 26s in 2015 with a presumption the BAE works will happen on the Clyde.

There is even a whole section describing what I said about bank runs: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lender_of_last_resort#Bank_runs_and_contagion

&gt; In the model, introducing a lender of last resort can prevent bank runs from happening, so that only the optimal equilibrium remains. This is because individuals are no longer afraid of a liquidity shortage and therefore have no incentive to withdraw early. The lender of last resort will never come into action because the mere promise is enough to provide the confidence necessary to prevent a panic.

&gt;So where Townsend shows spikes in shooting and reasonable key pass output crossed with almost zero end product (goals and assists), Depay delivers. 

That's what we need. END PRODUCT. That's always been my biggest problem with Townsend. I've said many times, he has the tools - the footwork, the speed but it just doesn't have IT. IT being End Product. The decision making too. That can't be taught, honestly - I don't think it can. He's 23 and too stuck in his ways. You can't say to a player or set up training now to say ''score more, assist more''. You have that, or you don't. 

My big grievance was - Townsend had 25 EPL games. 1 goal, 2 assists (IIRC). Even if Depay doubled that - 2 goals and 4 assists - that could be the difference between 3 1-1's and 3 points, and 3 2-1 2-1 2-1 and 9 points. 6 extra points.

...and this is the next point along that explains that this is a cost that is incurred my moterists themselves, I can't find a breakdown of externalities costs though:

&gt; By common agreement, the largest component cost is congestion (see Box 3). Yet some would not treat congestion in the same way as other externalities.[46] Whilst it is clear that the decision by one motorist to use a congested road network imposes delays on other motorists on that road network, the congestion is both imposed by and suffered by users of the road system. This is unlike environmental damage, such as air pollution, which is a cost imposed on the wider society, often on a future generation. The case for congestion charging is therefore one of making more efficient use of the road system rather than correcting the impact of the road system on society as a whole.

&gt;We also need to take a hard look at what a truly efficient transport system would look like. In parts of the country, it would be cheaper and even more ecological to move passengers to buses or special taxis. Yet rail needs to be developed further in and around London. We must also remember that driverless cars will eventually revolutionise mass transportation. This will reduce rail travel, apart from in congested urban areas, and render obsolete costly white elephants such as HS2.

That motoring has become more ecological, more expensive, subsidises other modes of transports and (according to your post above) *still* the cost of a vehicle is less than rail fares suggests that more competition and efficiency savings might help things.

That really just leaves Man City, Liverpool and Arsenal. With Man City, they have Joe Hart and just bought Caballero, Liverpool bought Mignolet last season (although admittedly Cech would be a huge improvement, but I don't see Cech joining Liverpool), and Szczesny looks set at Arsenal in addition to the fact that Mourinho would likely never sell a top player to Arsenal. One might say Man Utd have a shout, but will they want to displace De Gea? I'm not too sure.

In any case, for any of the clubs to get Cech would mean that they would be moving another player on, and at this stage in the transfer window and given earlier transfer activity, I'm not convinced they would want to do that.

They already had £1200 per head more government spending going into this... and considering one of the key areas of the austerity drive is to reduce government spending they've been very fortunate to escape much of that. Where the axe has fallen it tends to avoid Scotland, or have less impact than elsewhere. Nobody wants to see the Scots punished (well, nobody reasonable). But I do think Scots don't realise how fortunate they are. Despite their incessant complaining about being hard done by Westminster, they've actually come out of this relatively unscathed.

My preference would be for further devoliton - not because I back devolution, but because I think the solution to scumbags like Salmond is to put them in charge of **both** tax and spend. Right now David Cameron has to look like the bad guy for doing things like increasing VAT to pay down a shared national debt. A national debt that was enlarged considerably by bailing out Scottish banks as well as English banks. And all the whilst Alex Salmond gets to look like holier-than-thou giving out free prescriptions and university tuition. If Scottish politicians were in charge of collecting the money they spend it would a) make them more accountable and b) help Scots understand that you can have lots of free public services if you want, but it does come at a cost.

My suspicion is that in the event of a No vote, Scots will actually get further devolution. But the tradeoff will be the end of the Barnett formula and in effect they will be in charge of their own Tax and Spend for the most part. It means if rich Scots want to pay for services for poor Scots they can. But it also means wealthy Britons in Southern England won't have to contribute to it, and they won't have to look at Alex Salmonds smarmy fat face while he does it.

Also it's a question of how many people are using the trains (I'm assuming they've chosen peak fares for all of them). Lots of people want to get into/out of London during peak hours but only so many people can fit in the train, which is why they can charge so much and have those who can't afford it take the earlier, less convenient but much cheaper trains. None of the cities they've chosen for the other countries are big economic centres like London so perhaps demand to travel between them won't be as high.

British train fares are a real mess of confusion (standard fares sometimes being ludicrously expensive, or first class fares sometimes being very cheap and less than standard), and it wouldn't surprise me if it did turn out britain was more expensive, but to be honest I think our trains aren't that badly run and it sounds like we get a better service than most other countries.",0,1408543227,null,0,false,0,cjviyn4,t3_2e2em2,t1_cjviyn4,t3_2e2em2,null,1435339521,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The bottom line is that Scotland's economy is basically split between FS and oil and gas. FS will go tits up without a central bank for a number of fairly obvious reasons (lack of control over monetary policy and inability to provide bail outs first among them). It's been all over the news.



And if you're talking about Scotland not having any say over the central bank because the central bank is independent of government - well yes, that's the bloody point. By that logic, England doesn't have any say either. That isn't some anti-Scottish English conspiracy. If Scotland set up a central bank without that independence from Government, particularly with Salmond at the helm, they'd be frankly mad. In short, the Bank of England being independent of Government is not an argument for Scottish independence, it's just a sensible feature of UK monetary control.

Even Salmond isn't pig-headed enough to try it. It sounds nice but in practice it's much more costly, complicated and bound to fail than that (much like the whole of independence actually).",1,1408543561,null,0,false,0,cjvj3sl,t3_2e231g,t1_cjvj3sl,t1_cjvhpvv,null,1435339624,-4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-4

Obviously we will never know, but in an alternate reality where Scots weren't having an independence referendum at precisely the same time the Westminster government was having its austerity drive it seems likely that Scotland would have had to suffer a larger share of the cuts than it has so far.

Its important because in many ways Scotland is silently subsidized by Westminster, through the disproportionate allocation of public sector jobs and schemes. Yet, at a time of considerable public sector redundancies the Scots have managed to avoid much of that. I don't think Scots realize just how much their economy is propped up by the rUK. Instead they run to statistics that purport their GDP per capita is higher than the rUK. I'm not buying it.

I do agree, that both Scots and the rUK have had to endure austerity, but my point is that the rUK has actually taken a disproportionate share of the hit.

I see where your views side.

&gt; The UK refused to join the Euro so it could maintain full control over it's own currency, a decision which has clearly served us well so far, so why would they now even consider sharing control with another nation?

Again, what if economically thats the better option? Do you not think removing Scotland but keeping the pound solely for the UK won't have some negative effects on the UK economy? Could those negative affects not be greater than the negative affects of sharing the pound?

He most certainly gives a fuck but with Mario **you get what you give**, you give him love like the italy team or city in the early days and he'll be a beast, you give him shit and he wont give you the time of day.

When he first arrived at AC he was a goal scoring machine, he was unstoppable (think he had like 11 goals in 13?) however as soon as the team started to decline again his supplying lowered and when that happened the team came under heat and mario in particular became a target and he started to get racially abused (even by his own fans).

I dont know about you but if i was getting shit for the rest of the team under performing and racial abuse at that, I wouldnt give a fuck either, there is a big contrasting difference between Mario who is loved and adored by italy and mario who gets racially abused at milan.

true,drjokepu,eng-GreaterLondon,London,"I'm somewhat of confused about the article as it keeps using the term ""spousal visa"". In reality, spousal visas and ILRs and not really relevant here as fairly different rules apply to third country national family members of EU/EEA (but not British) citizens.

Normally they would apply for a document called a ""residence card of a family member of a Union citizen"", which is valid for five years (but only as long as the said EU family member stays in the UK). After five years they can apply for a ""permanent residence card"" which essentially grants them the same rights as any EU citizen would have. This mechanism is the same everywhere in the EU, so a non-EU citizen family member of a British citizen living in Germany would have to go through the same process.

From what I can tell the problem here was that her husband moved to Italy after 3 years (that is, ceased to exercise his treaty rights in the UK) and as a result, she has lost the right to live in the UK immediately, although there was no way for the government to know that until she applied for her permanent residence card.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"On the whole this is reasonable. Three points I disagree with though;

* On Trident it strikes me that both sides want it off Faslane. The Scots for obvious (if over-hyped) reasons and the rUK because it is giving the SNP unnecessary political capital, and represents a significant number of jobs that could be gratefully received elsewhere. However, as much as both sides might want it moved, I just don't see it on the cards. The only real solution I can see is for it to remain Sovereign UK territory with a face-saving concession to make the base ""Jointly run"" after some period of time (perhaps between 5 and 15 years). Then there may be some vague commitment to shifting the nuclear aspects of the base off-site over a longer time period (probably 25-40 years). 

* On your second point that Westminster doesn't set monetary policy in Scottish interests I totally disagree. It will be even more important if the Scottish economy is made up substantially of a hugely variable income from oil. For example you might have a BoE that would otherwise have raised interest rates to constrain inflating oil profits, that instead might now set its interest rate low because that is more beneficial for the south of Englands housing crisis. 

* Scotland isn't a net exporter. The UK is (by various techniques) either the worlds 4th or 6th Largest exporter. It just happens to also be the 4th largest importer. The UK as a whole actually exports more per capita than Scotland does. Scotland does export more in **manufactured goods**. These are the things we traditionally think of as exports - Wiskey, petroleum products, automotive parts etc. The UK however also exports heavily, but many UK exports are in less traditional products. E.g. [ARM Holdings PLC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_Holdings) is a good example, they're a large British company that ""exports"" processor designs. They are like Intel, except unlike Intel they don't sell the finished processor, instead they design them and then license the designs to other manufacturers to build. ARM processors are in virtually every electronic device with a microprocessor - mobile phones, tablets, digital watches, TVs etc. They don't look like a ""manufacturer"" and their offices aren't a big factory, but rather a very unassuming office in Cambridge. But none the less they do export. Other large British exporters are companies like Rolls Royce PLC which sell relatively small numbers of very expensive turbojet engines and other power generators. They don't employ hundreds of thousands of factor line assemblers because its whats called ""small volume high margin"". i.e. they don't sell much, but what they sell is very valuable. SSTL is a similar example, (Now part of Astrium) they build satellites. They don't make many and they aren't what you would consider a ""large"" exporter, but in fact they export high margin products.",0,1408545549,null,0,1408546099,0,cjvjzzi,t3_2e231g,t1_cjvjzzi,t1_cjvfgt8,null,1435339957,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9
true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"Inter, City, and then Milan are his professional clubs so far right?

Could you honestly point at any of them and say his time there was a failure?  The closest one would be Milan and the problems affecting the entire club stretch far beyond Balotelli. In fact,  he spent a large part of the season looking like the only player who gave a damn at all.  He won titles at Inter, and perhaps in spite of his temper won the title at City, in which he supplied the assist for Aguero's winner. He played a fairly important part in the success of each team. 

He is a very, very good footballer. If he's in the right environment he will absolutely flourish and be a massive asset. Liverpool is a young, hungry side full of ambition and energy.

In reality Scotland would likely get around a 9-10% stake in controlling the Bank of England, I used 50-50 as it would be the only stake that would be of any actual use to Scotland. A 10% stake for a country being run in a different way to the other 90% is next to worthless, the rUK controlling majority would win on every policy change ever tabled. 

Scotland is not an equal partner to the rUK, so I can understand the wish for independence. However Scotland also relies very heavily on the rUK for trade, services, and it's economy. It makes sense for Scotland to be sat at the big table in Westminster and have a small say in how the country is run. 

Independence would mean they can make their own decisions, but in reality they would still be very tied economically to the rUK, and with no say in how it's run at all, meaning their hands could be tied on policy just to keep up with the rUK. 

It's the same reason, despite being very euro-sceptic, I think the UK as a whole should stay in the EU, better to have a small say in how things are run in an economic zone in which you rely, than to have no say in how it's run but still remain reliant on it. 

A good example of what I'm getting at is Norway. They are not in the EU, but rely heavily on the EU for trade. To trade with the EU they have to stick the EUs rules, rules in which they have no say or control over, sure they ""could"" choose not to stick to them, but in reality this would destroy their economy.

A bit more digging finds another report that better quantifies the externalities.

http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http:/www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/307739/wider-costs-transport.pdf

A summary that I will shamelessly copy and paste [is here](http://ipayroadtax.com/no-such-thing-as-road-tax/when-will-drivers-start-paying-the-full-costs-of-motoring/), emphasis mine.

&gt;The 2009 Transport Select Committee report, Taxes and Charges on Road Users, calculated the total taxes and charges on UK road users as £48 billion per annum. The report quoted the typical annual expenditure on roads as about £8-9 billion.
&gt;
&gt;In the same report, the Department for Transport estimated that the average marginal external cost of driving a car an additional kilometre is 15.5 pence allowing for the congestion (estimated at 13.1 pence per kilometre), infrastructure, accidents, local air quality, noise and greenhouse gases. This compares to 3.6 pence per kilometre paid in fuel duty and VAT.
&gt;
&gt;However there are other costs to society as a result of our existing car-dependent transport patterns. In 2009 a Cabinet Office Strategy Unit report on urban transport attempted to quantify the costs of our existing urban transport patterns. Working with the Department for Transport, the Department for Communities and Local Government, the Department of Health and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), they arrived at the costs shown here:
&gt;
&gt; http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6034/6343837114_bd6d352fd0.jpg
&gt;
&gt;The figures are based on the best available evidence sources, adjusted to 2009 prices. Where there is uncertainty or disagreement, they have stated the likely range as shown in lighter shading in the bars. The conclusions changed policy makers’ understanding of the situation. **Previously, congestion had been thought to represent the majority of transport’s external costs** to society. Now the combined **costs of accidents, air quality, physical inactivity, greenhouse gas emissions and noise at £27-38 billion per annum** represent 71-78 per cent of the total.
&gt;
&gt;The total cost for the English urban areas is estimated at £38-49 billion. Given that the Cabinet Office’s report states that this covers 81 per cent of the population, scaling up the appropriate impacts gives an estimate of **£43-£56 billion** for the whole of the UK.",0,1408548420,null,0,false,0,cjvlenj,t3_2e29et,t1_cjvlenj,t1_cjvj7jz,null,1435448266,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Are we though? Balotelli has shown that when he joins a team he's very good until he loses motivation or falls our with people.

It's nothing to do with liking or not liking Townsend. It's starting to sound like you're ignoring my point purely because you're passing it off as me ''hating'' on him. It's not irrational at all - I still don't see those wingers that have magically learnt end product? I can't think of any. Klose turns up every WC, but that isn't a winger/inside forward in the last decade. And that's one example. I'm sure there's a few more ''defenders that played at lower leagues for years then bloomed late'' or players like Luca Toni who didn't hit any real prominence at CF till his move to Fiorentina at 27. But statistically, it's rare. That's why it's difficult to name these players - I can't think of any of the top of my head in the past decade, but I'm sure there might be I dunno...half dozen, max. Is it likely Townsend is one of those anomalies? That's the question. 

Do I want Townsend too progress? Yeah, it saves us money. Will he? Most probably not. Should we risk another season of him putting in so so performances, leaving us in the same boat as we are now with his value much less? That's up to Poch. Should we not go all out for Depay now, then watch him join Utd and literally become their Ronaldo mk2? That's up to Poch.

Why is it wrong that I want MY club to be the best it can be? Why can't I be angry that 25 game Townsend gave us 1 goal and 2 assists? Like I said - if that was even 2 goals and 4 assists that could turn 3 draws into 3 wins.

I'm talking about realpolitik. If the UK acted as I suggested above, then what exactly would either the creditors, or Scotland, do about it?

Or to put it another way:

&gt; If you owe the bank £100 then you have a problem. If you owe the bank £1m then the bank has a problem.

The UK owes an awful lot, and that effectively gives it a lot of power over creditors who want to get paid. I'm simply pointing out that there's absolutely nothing to stop the rUK using that power to ensure Scotland takes a share of the debt.

I notice I'm receiving several downvotes, but no-one, yourself included, has offered a solid reason why, if the rUK took the steps I've suggested, then the consequences I've suggested wouldn't follow.

&gt; Mate, the UK treasury has said the debt belongs to them aka the Bank of England. It's done, it will belong to the rUK after a yes vote.

I doubt the Bank of England has the final word on the debt that is owed by the entire country. Politicians are sure to want to have their say.

That's [quite difficult to determine](https://fullfact.org/articles/NHS_budget_health_spending_statistics-28697). If funding rises in absolute terms, but isn't quite keeping pace with inflation, is that a fall? The NHS did get more money after all, but then again that money doesn't buy as much as it did.

But let's say funding does keep pace with inflation. If funding doesn't keep pace with demand, is that a fall? Strictly speaking you're not seeing a ""fall in spending"", but you are seeing a fall in service.

We will need to wait to see how the NHS reforms play out, of course, but I think it's clear from their direction that there are plenty of ways that funding could fall quite significantly.

Previously most trusts were limited to doing about 2% of their work privately. That cap has been lifted, and they can now do up to 49% of their work privately - and have far more control over which services they offer.

Trusts switching their focus to more profitable services might decide to reduce the services that they do offer, and while the government might step in and create new trusts to fill (half of) that shortgap they clearly can't fund services that aren't available.

Perhaps the money freed up by not paying for those services would then be available to other parts of the NHS, but it seems more likely that it'd be used to justify a reduction in funding on the grounds that market-based healthcare was demonstrating itself to be more efficient.",0,1408549236,null,0,false,0,cjvltpt,t3_2e231g,t1_cjvltpt,t1_cjvlcc0,null,1435340462,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

I looked at engineering jobs in Cornwall a few years ago and they were offering wages below minimum wage for, say, electrical engineers with several years of experience. 

Consider that an engineer who works in the middle of London may well be just as skilled and educated as one who works in the middle of Cornwall. Then consider that a company can sell their product for the same price regardless if it's developed in a converted farmhouse in Cornwall or an office building in London.

I'd be more than happy to go and live and work in a place like Cornwall, but I'm not going to be taken for a ride by a company who thinks that it's OK to pay crap wages just because the area is seen as ""cheaper"".

I think this is a general problem in much of the UK. Places outside of London pay lower wages (and probably have lower overheads) just because they can. Ultimately it's self defeating because not many professional are going to stay in these areas doing the same work for much less money than in London (or other large city centres).",0,1408549443,null,0,1408550398,0,cjvlxjw,t3_2e2frs,t1_cjvlxjw,t1_cjvil9b,null,1435340537,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"I have no issue in giving Paulinho another season, i think there may be some talent there.

But, looking at his goals and assists from last season he is actually fairly middle of the road overall in the league. 

Paulinho had 6 goals and 2 assists in the PL, the 6 goals rank him 20th in the PL amongst midfielders in terms of goals.

If you look at the players directly surrounding Paulinho in goals scored it looks like this:

* Charlie Adam - 7
* Steve Sidwell - 7
* JonJo Shelvey - 6
* Paulinho - 6
* Frank Lampard -6

Those same 5 players had a conversion of shots to goal of:

* Steve Sidwell - 15%
* Charlie Adam - 12%
* Frank Lampard - 11%
* Paulinho - 8%
* JonJo Shelvey - 8%

Those same 5 players had pass completion % of:

* Paulinho - 84%
* JonJo Shelvey - 83%
* Frank Lampard - 83%
* Steve Sidwell - 83%
* Charlie Adam - 75%

Of those 5 players here is how the assists break out:

* JonJo Shelvey - 6
* Charlie Adam - 4
* Frank Lampard - 3
* Paulinho - 2
* Steve Sidwell - 2

Chances created for the same players:

* JonJo Shelvey - 45
* Frank Lampard - 33
* Chalrie Adam - 32
* Paulinho - 21
* Steve Sidwell - 21

Now Paulinho had more successful tackles than Adam, Lampard and Shelvey (Steve Sidwell had nearly 2x as many), Paulinho also had more interceptions than Adam or Lampard  (he was equal to Shelvey and streets behind Sidwell), but Paulinho also racked up about 600 more minutes on the field than either Lampard or Adam and about 100 less than Shelvey (again Sidwell had more than any of them by about 1,000 minutes).

So highlighting goals and assists as a reason to keep him doesn't mean much as he compares statistically (in a very light statistical look) to a part time player for a better team (Lampard), a cunt for a midtable team (Adam), an average player for an average team (Shelvey) and an ageing veteran for a horrendous team (Sidwell).
 
Eriksen, Ade, Walker and Hugo were all better players more consistently than Paulinho last season. I think Paulinho has some talent and could be a player, but he was mediocre last season (though he was absolutely outstanding against Stoke), i think he may come good for us....but honestly looking at those numbers (which are admittedly high level) if someone came in and made a big offer (like the rumour of the £20m from Juve) we should seriously consider it. 

If the big offer isn't there then we hold onto him and hope he has settled and fits with what Poch needs him to do, i think he may be able to do it.",0,1408549573,null,0,1408550031,0,cjvm00d,t3_2e30v0,t1_cjvm00d,t3_2e30v0,null,1435340587,11,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,11

On Scotland potentially being a net exporter,  I can't find the analysis I read previously, but there's this from the UK government report on the Scottish economy from January 2014:

&gt;  Excluding oil and gas, the value of Scottish imports has been higher than the value of exports every year since devolution. The inclusion of North Sea exports would have a positive impact on Scotland’s balance of trade, swinging the balance towards a trade surplus.

I'll have another look tonight and see if I can dig up the article I read on the topic. 

On Trident, I expect the UK government would rather invest solely on making arrangements for Trident's replacement, and not move up the timescale for that. The RUSI report a couple of days ago suggested that rebasing Trident would be cheaper than previously suggested although the timescale for rebasing was still quite long (8-10 years I think).  I don't expect any Scottish party would entertain the possibility of accepting an arrangement that extends to that 25-40 year period you're suggesting. However I think somewhere in the region of 15 years is reasonable.

Finally, on your point around monetary policy, do you know of a specific example where this has happened? I'm happy to be proven wrong. I just can't think a decision to benefit a particular aspect of 10% of the economy will have even been made *to the overall detriment* of the remainder.

Bank account: If I recall correctly the easiest place to open a bank account with is Lloyds, and all you need is your passport. I think we were somewhat lucky because we headed into a branch in a relatively quiet area during the day and managed to set up our accounts right then and there. I think generally you would need to make an appointment.

I had put in a lot of research prior to heading to London and I thought proof of address was necessary, so I ended up getting my NZ bank statements sent to my friends UK address and used that as my official proof of address (just in case we needed it).

I don't know anything about the Retail industry sorry so I cant comment on that. I'm not sure how to look for Retail work in the Greater London area. Some shops put advertisements on their shop windows so might be wise to head out and go window shopping.

You'll need an NI number to work in the UK (similar to NZ's IRD number), to [apply for an NI number](https://www.gov.uk/apply-national-insurance-number) you will need to call and apply (the call will cost as its an 0345 number), You should be able to get this sorted on the day you arrive (but receiving the NI number might take weeks).

It is now fixed point that Amy and Rory die in New York after long lives. During AtM, the couple has had three or four paradoxes piled on top of them and another one would probably mean something devastating -- more than usually. The amount of paradoxes involved in the episode is explained well [in this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/29oowz/what_plot_holes_are_you_fine_with/cinbvud). This is my major point that should have been stated more explicitly in the episode: even a slight disturbance on their life now has possibly catastrophic consequences. Both parties (the Doctor and Amy+Rory) understand this.

It is therefore incredibly dangerous for the Doctor to even meet them, as things happen to happen when he is around. This was foreshadowed earlier in Power of Three, where a simple anniversary gift turns out to be an adventure followed by two weeks of adventuring when Doctor was supposedly to just drop them back at the party. This what happens when you are with the Doctor and again, all parties now this. But now it is more dangerous than normal, since they are destined to die in New York.

Now we come to the significance of Amy's farewell -- it is exactly that: voluntarily saying goodbye. The couple had been thinking about choosing normal life for quite some time (IMHO since God Complex in season 6) and finally Amy completes her character arc by choosing to finally grow up and settle down, which is the culmination of her growing as a character from the girl escaping marriage from season 5. So she says goodbye to her Raggedy Man and the great but dangerous adventures -- even more so now that it would defy a fixed point in time ie. their deaths in New York. She is saying that even if there would be a way for them to see each other, their life is now without the Doctor. And Doctor is heartbroken, but understands this as well and therefore does not try.

Your source states that UAE is ranked the top 14th nation in the world for human rights. That seems pretty good for a country that was little more than a loose collection of warring nomadic tribes less than a generation ago. 

I am also not sure what that has to do with crime rates in London. Even if UAE does have a poor human rights record, what relevance does that have to rates of pickpocketing in London? Bear in mind that theft and robbery are exceptionally rare in UAE so a lot of Emiratis become a little complacent/naive and possibly don't even realise it is a risk.

It would be immensely disappointing if it came to that, and this isn't an invitation for people to jump in and boast about how they would happily crush Scotland in several ways if they don't take on debt, our governments are not moody teenagers.",1,1408550423,null,0,1408550635,0,cjvmfyd,t3_2e231g,t1_cjvmfyd,t1_cjvkxu4,null,1435340881,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

I completely agree. I'm lucky that I'm on a London wage whilst living in Cardiff. I was really worried about a huge huge drop in wage if I moved Cornwall and lost my job. I would struggle to find a regular contract like this which pays so well and offers such flexibility. 

In London its not difficult to get a job paying £70k+ doing the same thing I do today but in Cornwall, for similar positions they were advertising £30k as the max (most we're looking for £21k to £25k). I know £30k is still a great wage to have but its not the market value.

&gt;

&gt;__Semantic satiation__ (also __semantic saturation__) is a [psychological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological) phenomenon in which [repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetition_(rhetorical_device\)) causes a word or phrase to temporarily lose [meaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_(linguistic\)) for the listener, who then perceives the speech as repeated meaningless sounds.

true,ikkleste,eng-yorkshire,Something like Yorkshire,"There is a part of it that, because of the relative narrow demographic, (18 to 24), and the frequency of elections (5 years), that people don't necessarily get to vote at times that it'll affect them. People who are 22 now still have never had a chance to vote. 
That'll be just about everyone on an apprenticeship, lasting 1-4 years, and starting at 16 or 18.
If they are exclusively self interested voters, they won't be voting on the grounds of the apprenticeships/education issues they've already passed that point.

Others will be voting having just turned 18 and not yet being engaged in politics or having fully formed opinions yet. I'd bet if you break down the vote of that demographic by year, you'd see an increase from 18 to 24.

It's alright saying ""you youngsters should get out and vote, if you want things to change in your favour"", but for everyone you get through to that's one more voting in the next demographic at the next election, and who'll be replaced by some other kid with a not-seeing-the-point attitude until they figure that actually yes this shit does affect them, does affect the apprentice wages they are paid just in-time for them to move on from their apprenticeships and get a new bunch of priorities.

THe youngest demographic will always have a naive attiude, you are of course right we should do our best to encourage them, but there are reasons for a low turnout, and i think calling them selfish and stupid is a little harsh. It takes a little while of being exposed to the real world to figure out how it all works. 

Last election a lot of this demographic voted for the lib dems based on certain education based election pledges. That obviously went well.


Hell I'm 34, like to think of myself as politically aware, I vote, and a big part of me still think it matters for jack shit. It doesn't matter who I vote for, Labour will take my seat, it's as safe as houses, either way the Tories or Labour will get into government, there's an outside chance they'll just be the senior party in a coalition, and most likely that might pull their policy on certain issues lib demwards. But even in that question - and therefore the question of what policy gets enacted my vote is largely irrelevant. No-one is chasing my vote.

you will usually have a bed-in period in any job where they can dismiss you if they feel like you dont fit, normally called a probationery period (usually 3-6 months), but after this you are considered a full time employee, with full employee rights. 

You have every right to question the jobs specification, if he had the original job spec, and this doesnt match up, then he has grounds to question this with his boss/employer. 

they cannot fire you on the spot. they will need grounds to do so, after 3 or more warnings, verbal, written, final written and verbal, and then they have decent grounds for dismissal. even in such a situation you have the opportunity to improve yourself, or find another job. 

this sounds like an office job where such rules apply. anything else is a case for unfair dismissal. 

i also question the OP for waiting 6 months before questioning this? i would have done so in the first week or so, if i was unhappy. if he signed a contract he has every right as an employee, if he signed nothing, then that's his own stupid fault, and he should walk away from the job

A lot of it is about seeing how the bigger picture connects, and is a skill that I'd argue I have more than some STEM people. Quite oftem STEM students are very very good at what they do, and that may be one thing. But having the ability to see how two completely different specialist subjects interact and overlap is in itself an extremely useful skill in all walks of life.

&gt; David Thomas Come on brothers and sisters. Do I need to spell it out? ISIS leader al Baghdadi was trained by Mossad (Israeli CIA) and is funded/weaponised by US by which to destabilise Arab states so that the West do not have to risk the blood of their own soldiers to go the destabilising. ISIS = brothers killing brothers.
&gt; 
&gt; Dohak Yam Why dont u people get it? are you this brainwashed by media? THE WHOLE POINT OF MEDIA IS TO MAKE ISIS APPEAR EVIL. What makes you think they will give good image of Khilafah when THEY destroyed it in the first place 90 years ago.
&gt; 
&gt; El Impoluto True muslims are trying to get to Israel, and the not so true muslims are blocking their path, in turn, making it more difficult for them to set up a base along the borders to attack Israel.
&gt; 
&gt; Dohak Yam You cannot follow quran and sunnah by just sitting at home while your brothers and sisters are being opressed. He followed quran and sunnah and helped establish Khliafah and sharia, and saved the sunnis from the decades long oppression of oppressive goverments.
&gt; 
&gt; Dhul Qarnayn If you want to know the truth of ISIS see the smile on the face of martyed mujahidden. Sign from Allah
&gt; 
&gt; Kam Haq Isis are creation of west funded and trained by them. Anyone support Isis are fools your are supporting murderers. I pray that Allah opens your eyes amen.
&gt; 
&gt; Naz Hassan Isis are terrorist funded and created by the CIA, they are fighting their own people if they wanted to fight anybody why aren't they in Israel instead they are in Muslim countries killing Muslims anyone that follows them doesn't know what they are talking about and are brainwashed
&gt; 
&gt; Imran Kashmiri Malala* is part of the zionist and american agenda she is a frauddo some research on her
&gt; *she was shot by the fucking Taliban, this comment got fifty likes.
&gt; Kam Haq All Isis is good at is cutting peoples head off lol nothing Islamic about them. Anyone kills innocent is not Muslim u brain washed people need to realise Muslims are being used by the new world order. And Isis is being trained and funded by west that's another reason for them to come back into Iraq.
&gt; 
&gt; Nadia Hussain Mua As you are already aware WhatsApp was brought by Facebook in February 2014 for 19 Billion dollars. Facebook and Instagram are owned by Mark Zuckerberg who is a open donor and supporter of Zionist Israel. He has blatantly donated billions to Israel who are inhumanely killing our Palestinian brothers and sisters. Please note Jeff Rothschild is the Vice President of Infrastructure software and thus also a share holder in Facebook. There are other non Zionist apps such as the Telegram Messaging App. It's available on both android and apple users created by two brothers in Berlin. It's better encrypted, much safer and thus better than WhatsApp. Never forget WhatsApp is Zionist backed so all we do and say is monitored and can leave us vulnerable to be exploited later. Also as we continue to stay members of these sites and apps we're directly supporting Zionist companies. This is an opportunity to further boycott Israel sponsors and Mark Zuckerberg has been very generous to them. Facebook has donated way more money than the other companies like Tesco, McDonalds who we are already boycotting. Can we all install telegram please and use that instead.

&gt; Apathy? General discontent with all the parties? Couldn't make it? Love all the parties too much to decide? Who knows. The point is, they will continue getting ignored until they count themselves in and vote for someone that represents them. It's more than likely you will never have a party that exactly matches what you want from a ruling party.

That's great, but none of what you just said suggests it'd be better for **force** people to vote.

&gt; That's what compromises are for.

Indeed, you should accept that some don't want to vote.

&gt; Or is having a good old whinge easier?

Well you're the one whinging about people note voting and wanting to **force** them to vote.

I'll throw my vote away next general election, probably on green.  But if I was forced too, well that'd certainly give me a reason not to vote.  Well unless there was a party that would overturn that undemocratic law.

People mistake a defensive philosophy for pragmatism, and whilst this is true for some sides, I think the pragmatic approach for our team is to capitalize on our strengths in a way that situation calls for; rather than having a plan B, we should be having lots of variations on our plan A. 

In these tough European away fixtures playing a mobile, pressing game without the all out attacking approach with the ball, and instead hitting teams on the counter, is the way to go. Putting two slow, immobile midfielders in place, especially if Rodgers wants to play the 4231 and not 433, is suicide. Teams like Dortmund, Barca, Munich and Madrid will cut us open like a hot knife in butter. If you HAVE to play Lucas and Gerrard then it can't be in a 4231 for heavens sake, we learnt that last season; they need a Henderson or an Allen as part of the 3 in midfield rather than Coutinho in number 10. But then even still I see no reason to change styles or build the team around playing Gerrard and Lucas together in any scenario.. They're interchangeable rather than compatible. Lucas offers more defensively and positionally, whilst Gerrard offers a better outlet ball, leadership and dead ball expertise; both are passengers in a team like ours and we can't afford to have two in the side at once. 

You could argue that Lucas for those tough European away fixture would make more sense but, in my opinion, Gerrard offers enough to compensate for his defensive shortcomings to get the nod in any demanding game. If he's dropped I'd rather it be Allen in a midfield of Allen-Can-Hendo for which we'd press the opposition to death, *that* could be a pragmatic approach for our tougher fixtures.

[It's not](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23618487) I don't wish to be confrontational on a point by point thing, but population growth concerns me, I think the easiest way to help prevent environmental issues, is simply by not growing the population.

&gt; don't own a car, just order the nearest self-driving pool car to come to your house.

Whilst I think that will work for many situations, I don't think it will for many, having a car is very useful if you've got say children, because you can always have a change of clothes, wipes, towels etc handy.  Heck I always keep 4L of water and a little sleeping back in mine, after being trapped in the tailback of a disastrous motorway crash for 6 hours, I serendipitously had camping supplies still in the boot.  I realised how useful that was!

We can see the value people place on the ownership, given the current levels of car club vs ownership, in areas that the car club is very active in.  The other issue is resource allocation, the fact is I know that (congestion aside) I can always, at any moment, go anywhere.  How many cars to users would we need?  1:2?  1:3?

true,Kesuke,null,null,"On scottish import:export its deceptive and different measures rank it differently. The trouble is, imports to the UK (including Scotland) tend to come via Southampton (75%), The Channel Tunnel or air-freight via Heathrow and Gatwick. So for example, when Tesco buys a French produced product it will import it via Southampton, then ship it to Scotland where it is consumed. So it's difficult to pick apart what the Scots truly import. In contrast, its easier to track the value of exports of Scottish businesses since its part of the basis for their tax return. For that purpose most sources give the Scots a population share of UK imports (which is probably reasonably accurate). Of course when the SNP want to twist the facts its pretty easy for them to ignore this.  

Replacing the SSBN fleet and relocating HMNB Clyde are unrelated things. HMNB Clyde or some alternative will need to be operational regardless of which ship type is at sea. Infact the first sumbarine won't be built until 2028. So its likely to be around 2038 by the time the last of the new class is in RN hands. HMNB Clyde will service both ship types though, since the SSBN-X replacement to the Trident-System (i.e. the Missile and the launcher) is largely backwards compatible with Trident and is more an evolution than a redesign. I think you've mistaken the Trident Replacement Program for a replacement of the land facilities at the Clyde. They aren't the same thing. A small amount of the total replacement budget is set aside to make modifications to HMNB Clyde for the new ship types - not a full relocation of the facility. 

I am absolutely certain there are examples when monetary policy has been adjusted to consider the effect it would have on oil particularly, and on Scots more broadly (particularly Scottish banks!). It's a significant addition to GDP and the impact of any macroeconomic policy will factor in the effect it would have on this industry. I'm not an economist so without trawling the internet and reading monetary policy committee minutes I can't cite a specific example but I think its reasonable to say of course they have. In an independent Scotland that wouldn't be the case. The only think the BoE and the Monetary Policy Committee need to consider is how macroeconomic policy affects the rUK. There might even be times where the rUK can use its larger size and control of economic policy for Sterling to reduce Scottish profits in order to benefit British businesses... this might particularly be the case if the UK develops a Shale Gas industry that is competing for market share with North Sea Oil products.",0,1408552745,null,0,1408552964,0,cjvnog7,t3_2e231g,t1_cjvnog7,t1_cjvm4z4,null,1435341707,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Hmm, yes. All better off. 

&gt;Scotland is getting a very good deal here already trying to play hard ball to also avoid its share of the national debt

In what way does Scotland get this good deal? It more than supports itself within the UK? As part of the union it shouldn't even have to, but it does. 

Scotland isn't even attempting to play hard ball here. That's what is being represented by the press which I'm sure that would usually see as  tellers of half truths and damn lies. 

Scotland is asking for a fair share of assets and debt after independence. One side is saying no assets...

I'm not voting No because I think the UK is all rainbow farts and unicorns, but I'm actively avoiding voting Yes because I think the Yes campaign and the SNP lack any sort of credibility when it comes to articulating the answers to the sorts of questions that people are asking.

Even if they *could* give convincing answers over things like the currency, I'm not in any way convinced that my life would be BETTER in the event of a No vote.

Talk of democratic deficits and representative governments are all well and good, but they don't actually have a material impact on my happiness or the welfare of my family whereas a Yes vote would have very serious risks for both of those that I'm just not willing to take.

If I were you, I'd do the following.

1) Make sure that your apprenticeship leads to a job or a sought after skill in the end. You can do this by sitting down with your boss and agreeing certain goals - tell them that you expect to be given a job if you've met those goals. If he hesitates or says no - than I really think your wasting your time. (Make sure you've been working there for at least 1 or 2 months) Find out if your employer is serious about hiring you later and paying you decent money. If not, tell them your cutting your hours back to 2 - 3 days week, use extra to find some other work or opportunities. 

2) Send your neighbour an invoice for the work. Ensure that it has got written 'Amount payable within 14 days otherwise fees and interest may apply' etc. Something that makes him pay soonish hopefully. Have a chat with your mum before you do this - as it may cause her to get upset.

3) Stop spending so much money on your SO. If she is amazing as you say she is, she'll understand - I hope she does :) .  Go dutch on dinner and cinemas etc Save that money up instead.

Best of luck.

So next year, that 15.671 from 10/11 won't be included in our total - dropping us down to 23.093. To get back up to the 38 point range means getting at least 15 points this year. 

Getting past the group stages will be just about enough. We already have 4 for participation in the group stage. We get 2 points for a group win and 1 point for a draw. So if we win get through the group with 10 points - 3 wins and a draw that would give us a total of 11. We then get 4 more for participating in the round of 16 bringing us up to the magical 15.  If we fail to achieve this or we fail to qualify for Europe this season our co-efficient will plummet and we could be ranked with the likes of CFR Cluj and Sparta Prague next season.

there's probably a ton more. You're just obsessed with Islam to such an extent that you can't see the parallels with other religions because you don't seek them.  

Its worth noting that Islam has both the old and the new testament within it as teachings so they still have the happy clappy Jesus stuff. There are certain aspects of Islam that are much more spiritual than the warlike people that it seems like you're only listening to.

That particular report comes from the UK treasury rather than the SNP,  and there are also the GERS figures to go on. However, I take your point that it's hard to put a concrete figure on it, and obviously the state of affairs now isn't an accurate predictor of the situation after a Yes vote.

I had thought the fleet was being delivered by 2028, clearly I should have read more closely! That puts an interesting twist on it, because I don't see any way that an SNP negotiating team could come away with a relocation date any further into the future: it would go against everything they've said in the build up to the referendum (and indeed, a core principle of their party).  Given the recent report says that relocation is possible in a shorter time frame, that might be the path that has to be tread.

As for monetary policy, I'm not an economist either so without a specific example I can't really take the discussion any further than you've done. However you've given me food for thought.

Totally disagree. Look at the top sides around the world and you'll see very few 'wingers'. 

Germany's width comes from their fullbacks.

Real Madrid's width comes from their fullbacks.

Chelsea's width comes from their fullbacks. 

They all have players who start centrally and look to find the space - and that space is often out wide - but they're not wingers hugging the touchline. They're playing more centrally and drifting out.

We actually have a good number of full/wing backs who can do this - but we lack the holding midfielder to protect and serve when Byram/Warnock/et-all go forward. 

If we had a Matic/Alonso/Schweinsteiger type player (obviously not the same quality, but you know what I mean) we'd have someone who could protect and distribute - right now we're so poor in possession it doesn't matter if we have width or not because no one can quarterback the play adequately.

Why do we allow the Middle East to dominate our property and luxury goods markets so heavily? We're becoming too economically reliant on barbaric countries like Saudi Arabia.

Start banning the extremist radical Islamic groups in the UK, or at least infiltrate them so heavily that they are effectively neutered (which is what we do with neo-nazi organisations). As a general rule, any organisation that thinks killing non-believers is OK shouldn't really be allowed to exist... Radical preachers that talk bullshite about declaring jihad on evil westerners can fuck off too, this is what hate speech laws actually exist for, not for arresting people who make jokes on Twitter... 

More community involvement with Muslim-dominated areas to ensure they don't become ghetto's. Money to regenerate areas to make people less likely to turn to extremist groups. Encourage a diverse police force and government, while still showing zero tolerance to corrupt behaviour. Look at Tower Hamlets, why haven't the government stepped in when there's been obvious vote rigging and voter intimidation? We shouldn't be tolerating that kind of shit full stop. It sends a message to everyone (especially to those of a similar ethnic background) that you can get into power if you're a corrupt crook, but if you're a moderate, normal person, you can fuck off. That's not inclusive.

Less autonomy for schools that show signs of becoming controlled by religious fundamentalists. If a school treads out of line the local authority should do its job and rein them back in, get rid of the dodgy governors and install governors who are actually interested in the education of children, not religious indoctrination.

There are many solutions, there's no 1 thing that will solve the problem. What we need is the political will to implement these solutions. 

As a country we need to say no to religious extremism, and currently it's mostly Islamic extremism that we're seeing in this country. The government needs to actually do its job, they can't eliminate the problem but they can heavily reduce it by taking actual actions rather than just talking.

Yes. I don't know if you've been following current affairs at all (I assume you've just been shouting at a Quran for the past decade or something) but the basic premise is that there are a bunch of radical Islamists that reject _everything_ Western. When I say _everything_ we're going back. We're going waaaaaaaaaay back all the way to the Enlightenment.  
We're talking liberalism, we're talking nationalism even technology to a degree, all of it. Consumer goods and Capitalism especially :D, they reject it all. Think of them like militant marxist hippies or environmentalists who want to destroy all our technology and put us back to the stone age.... kinda like Paul Pot did with Cambodia (you know Paul Pot?).  

Basically its like that kid at school that you went to that was really into Marxism and got arrested by the police for trying to detonate an explosive next a mansion on the posh estate. That kid.  

Now imagine that kid comes originally from another country.... and when he reads the history of that country he realises that his adoptive country fucked it over _royally_ over the past couple of centuries. Now imagine that someone else already into this Marxist hippy shit gets to talk to this kid. Fills his head with tin-foil ""Protocols of Zion"" (you know this one?) bullshit. Then imagine he offers to take him to a training camp and give him a gun and let him fight for what he ""believes"" in.  

That's what we're talking about. Its political, its not about the religion.  

The Muslim pedo ring is no different to the BBC grooming ring and those ""Sharia Patrols"" are just a bunch of kids (much like the Marxist twat) waving their willies about.  
Now I'll agree with you to the point that if I ever bump into a ""Sharia Patrol"" I'll be giving them a _very_ large piece of my mind as that sort of willy waving is in incredibly poor form.  

Now please promise me that you'll try to read up a little more on the history and try to empathise with these people so you can understand why they're doing the mental shit AND stop fucking looking at the Quran all the time, its making you blind to what really matters here.",0,1408556425,null,0,false,0,cjvpp3k,t3_2e2pm0,t1_cjvpp3k,t1_cjvpb6o,null,1435447906,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Where we have strength is in 2 areas that the rest of our competitors for the Top 4 (Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Man Utd) are lacking; Central Midfield, especially defensively (Capoue, Sandro, Paulinho, Bentaleb) and Depth.

United, Arsenal, and Liverpool have all been *dying* for a midfield destroyer like Capoue or Sandro for years. Or do you honestly think that Lucas Leiva, Mathieu Flamini, and Phil Jones are better CDMs than Capoue?

Moreover, we have depth in defense. No, Vertonghen isn't probably any better than Koscielny or Mertesacker. But Dier looks as good as Chambers, and Vlad is just as good as well. Do you think Dier and Chiriches are better than Kolo Toure? How about Tyler Blackett?

Arsenal have 3 CBs as I write this; Mertesacker, Koscielny, and Chambers. We have 5, 6 if you count Fryers. Our 3rd CB is better than their 3rd CB, and we have 2 more behind him who are serviceable. Arsenal have *nobody*. Man Utd are in the same boat, except I think Vertonghen is better than Smalling or Evans; behind them, they have Jones (who is truly a RB, but who can play as a CB or CDM) and 19 year old Tyler Blackett, who looked, well, 19 against Swansea.

Moreover, as I posted elsewhere; We don't have the capability to go out and sign Alexis Sanchez for 30 million pounds. Or Cesc Fabregas, or Robin Van Persie. Instead, we sign Christian Eriksen, who at 21, is one of the brightest young stars in the game, for 10 million pounds, and hope he develops into a Mesut Ozil. Ditto Lamela; we buy stars before they're stars *because we can't buy the finished product*. It's what happened with Bale, with Modric, with Berbatov, Sheringham, Gascoigne Keane, even washouts like David Bentley were bought with the idea they would develop into world-class stars.

And I do think Liverpool, Everton and United would love to have many of our players.

Chelsea and City are on a whole different level; they're Title contenders, we're not there yet, it's not point comparing ourselves against them. But against the rest of the top 4? I think we actually stack up quite nicely.

It's a lot easier for people to feel empathy in a situation they can relate to.

For example, if it was reported on the news that someone had died in a car crash in a village hundreds of miles away you'd probably brush it off as just news. You'd feel sad for the family members etc but not to any significant degree

However if you found out the car crash victim was your childhood friend from school the news would have a much more significant effect on you as you can personally relate to it. 

That's just human nature.

Hundreds of thousands of people across the world die every day for all manner of reasons. If we were to feel the same amount of empathy for every single one of those deaths we'd never get out of bed from all the grief! Instead our minds focus on the ones we can relate to.

Additionally, if you are on a Tier 4 like I'm assuming, your university will be able to help you find jobs in the area.

But, it'd be a little outlandish to say that if Lamela hypothetically played for Liverpool, and he was hypotehtically on form, that his skill set would in no way match the squad or allow him to displace anyone, not even Coutinho (who was trash this past week).

That said, it is a nice town when it comes to going out for a drink. If you're looking for proper traditional pubs with buildings that look about 1000 years old, they're in the more rural areas of Harrogate. However there are a few decent ones in the town center.

One of my favourite places that I regularly go to is the Coach and Horses on West Park. It's a traditional pub with good service and has a pretty friendly atmosphere. Drinks aren't cheap, but not too expensive either, but it's normal for Harrogate prices!

There's also the Old Bell Tavern on Royal Parade. Traditional and in a nice location. Again, not a cheap place, but it is Harrogate.

If you're looking for proper traditional and don't mind going a bit outside the town, I'd recommend the Travellers Rest on Crimple Lane.

One of the cheapest somewhat 'traditional' places you can find that isn't a Wetherspoons is The Alexandra just off West Park. Personally it's not my favourite place in the world, but it's not too bad for what it is and I think it fits with what you're looking for.

Probably cheapest place in the town centre is Wetherspoons on Parliament Street. Not exactly a 'traditional pub' by any means, but it is what it is and it stays open quite late.

Like I said then, people hated Sturridge when we signed him, but two years later and people are hailing him as the next Liverpool great. Balotelli has down nothing to Liverpool or our fans, he hasn't said anything to irk us. IMO Balotelli has the potential to be better than Sturridge, he just needs to buy into the Liverpool system/way. &amp;Brendan Rodgers has already proved that there isn't a better manager making players buy-in to what he's trying to accomplish than him. I believe in Brendan and I believe in our current squad that we wouldn't Balotelli ""ruin"" our team morale. He's been through a lot in the past 2 years, he's already saw the grass isn't greener on the other side (Italy). I don't believe he would ruin a chance to stay with Liverpool if he came. &amp;We're all forgetting, Merseyside isn't London. Balotelli won't be able to find much trouble and distractions in Merseyside, especially now that he's engaged. Life changes and people change, give the man a break, hell give him a chance. 

I, for one, hope we sign Balotelli. Other than Cavani, I prefer Balotelli over Falcao, who would leave us within 2 years for Real.

Off peak is where you could take the train or you could take the car. Obviously they would rather you take the train so fares are set to compete with petrol costs, but low enough to entice you into reading a book on a train instead.

Advance tickets are sale logic. If the petrol would be £30, and today train fare is £44 but a tomorrow train fare is £12 and you're flexible with dates, you go tomorrow and give them your £12 rather than giving BP £30

I have an old fashioned outlook and often consider the 4-4-2 as the standard way to go. It probably comes from my school football days.

Having somebody to run the ball from the halfway line to a corner without stretching the team's formation has always been, for me, the very best way to bring your attack forward.

You're right about our full-backs and even if I were to stand by my argument that wingers are what we need, I'd absolutely have to agree that a solid holding midfielder would be a great asset to the team.

There is no argument with that position. No assets no debt. 

&gt;IScotland would get their share of the assets by assuming a share of debt accrued by the whole of the previous state. What can you offer rUK for control of the pound?

What can you offer iScotland for share of the debt? 

Slightly easier...Scotland is in a union of governments with the UK. The UK is an equal partner in this whether it likes it or not...lets resolve things to our mutual benefit. Seems ok to most reasonable people.

1) It's a mix of two things. One would be my experience as a trivia host. I've hosted hundreds of bar trivia contests and you definitely get a feel for what information is known by more people. The other, honestly, is a little bit of common sense. Information that you learn in grammar school is going to be a much lower difficulty level than a very obscure factoid.

2) Absolutely. Once I get enough regular traffic to the site, I would love to be able to branch off and have themed contests. I have ideas for specific sport related trivia with prizes that are specific to that sport. Things of that nature are definitely in the plans for the future.

&gt;__Sharesave__, also known as __Save As You Earn__, *SAYE*, or the __Savings Related Share Option Scheme__, is a British savings scheme designed to encourage employees to buy stakes in the companies for which they work.  It was introduced by the [British government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_government) in 1980, with [HM Revenue &amp; Customs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Revenue_%26_Customs) approval, according to a model set by the [Treasury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty%27s_Treasury). From 6 April 2014, HMRC approval will no longer be required for a SAYE plan to obtain tax benefits, instead an employer is required to self-certify that the SAYE meets the requirements of the relevant legislation. Accordingly from 6 April 2014, a SAYE plan should no longer be referred to as an HMRC approved plan.

Sure, it's going to be bloody and horrific in the short term but in the long run it will allow the people of the middle east to take charge of their own destiny and re-organise the region along traditional tribal lines rather than the ad-hoc, western formed countries we have now.

I think the last decade has shown us that we simply can't bomb these people into submission. Islam and the middle east in general has a lot of issues and contradictions it needs to work through, maybe an Islamic state would give the Muslims a sense of identity and purpose and stop them from fighting this weird crusade against the west that they seem to be doing now.

Or they'll just turn inwards and purge themselves into extinction.

I don't know, the whole region has been volatile since the fall of the Ottoman Empire and maybe this horrible situation is just a process that needs to happen before peace can reign.

Well this is the one thing I like to point out to people who ""wonder why they hate the West's freedoms so much"".  
It's not about that, what they _really_ want to do is kill each other (ye olde Shia/Sunni split), what ""impresses"" me is how we've managed to piss off enough of them sufficiently to make them turn those guns to the west.  

Again I figure this is case in point, the US are providing air power I imagine to Iraq right now which results in ISIS pulling stunts like this, the same way the Somalians pulled their Kenyan mall shooting stunt when the US helped in Somalia recently.  

I'm not necessarily saying that they're justified to respond like this (although I imagine there is little else they can do) but it is still vaguely a product of intervention. I dunno, a lot of people don't see the reasoning behind the terrorism, much like people don't know that Osama Bin Laden found his resolve in the smoldering rubble of Lebanon following an Israeli bombing run.  

If there is anything positive to take from this its that these sort of acts are typically ones of desperation, a final whimper if you will, a desperate roll of the dice.... because they're getting the shit kicked out of them by US air power.  

Still.... allowing the Islamic Caliphate to exist somewhere means a sacrificial lamb of a country. I wonder which one.  
I'd personally agree that it might be the wisest long term move, these people need to learn that their leaders are not as good as they think they are.

First Scotland is not a union of governments and why should rUK with a population of approximately 58 million and a much larger economy be seen as an equal partner with a new nation of 5.25 million and a smaller, riskier  (oil and banking) economy?

I think that unless someone is using some ridiculous factor, the usual yardsticks for measuring the size and success of a football club is basically down to the size of the fan base, the number of domestic titles, and the number of continental titles. I don't think anyone could make any sort of case based on these that Liverpool is **the** biggest club in Europe, when it is contesting with the likes of Real Madrid (in terms of European titles), Barcelona (in terms of prestige), and Manchester United (in terms of domestic titles. One of the biggest? Sure. 

When someone makes the statement that XXX club is the biggest club in Europe, especially, it isn't hard to figure out that the number of European Titles is easily the main determining factor there. The fact is that he made the statement that Liverpool is the biggest club in Europe, which is pure bullshit. Whether it was a joke (as some claimed), or an emotionally-charged statement (which is my conclusion), it doesn't take away the fact that it is a ridiculous statement to make.

Your driving factor is nearly always what's called ""AHT"" or ""Average Handling Time"". Simply put, it's the average time taken on a call. Lower average means you're taking more calls and the lower the average in the whole centre, the more calls you all take (And consequently, the less agents they need). In a call centre, it's usually the most important factor of the call. Get what you need done as quickly as possible - but that doesn't mean rush, if you rush then you'll make mistakes or confuse the customer, so you have to strike the right balance.

The second most important is usually your repeat rate. I'm not sure how much this will factor into Delta, but it's basically get the call done correctly the first time. I.e. make sure you get the right details so they don't have to phone in again. Like with the above, less repeats means more calls and more calls means it's better for the business.

Learn the phonetic alphabet. You probably won't need it for the interview, but it'll help you on the phone. You'll be surprised how terrible some phone lines are and how awful some people's accents are. 

Other than that, it'll be an interview like any other. Smile lots, don't cross your arms or put your hands in your pockets (The ""Mr Burns"" pose usually goes down well), make sure to ask some good relevant questions (a good one is ""How is our performance measured?"" as it implies you're keen on quality which is a big deal). If they have any group exercises, don't be shy. Most people there will be shy and you'll stand out if you just take a bit of initiative.

true,DaveCarrot,null,null,"Ok I'll bite, even though I really don't see this happening lets assume it does. £20m is likely to comprise of the reported £12m loan fee and £8m wages (That is about £200,000 over the course of the season). Falcao is reported to be on £280,000 a week tax free with Monaco so that wage figure is probably wrong, but lets assume it is correct. What are the pros and cons of signing Falcao?

Pros:

* One of the best strikers in the world, if he can stay fit he would almost guarantee an extra 20 goals a season for us.

* Takes a lot of pressure off Sturridge. There is no doubt Sturridge is brilliant but he is injury prone, if he does get injured we will be relying on Lambert and Borini. Getting Falcao would arguably give us the two best strikers in the league.

* Dynamic- Falcao like Suarez is a player who on his day can win a game by himself.

* A loan move with an option to buy gives us options. Instead of panic buying (see Carroll a few years ago) we get a brilliant striker for a year. If he is good we can consider buying him, if he doesn't live up to expectations we a have a year to scout for a player that will.

Cons:

* Injury- My only worry with Falcao is injury. If he was injury free the last year I wouldn't be writing this; the fact is though he is coming back from an ACL injury. Although ACL surgery has a high success rate their is a risk he may never be the same player he once was.

* No resale value. If he gets injured/ is a flop we throw £20m down the drain. Unlike the Carroll deal where we were able to get back some of our investment.

 We won't find a better player than Falcao for £12m. If he can avoid injury I think it would be a brilliant deal for us, but that is a big if. Ideally if we could negotiate a performance/ number of appearances based loan it would be great, but I can't see Monaco being too keen on that.",0,1408561458,null,0,false,0,cjvsgnv,t3_2e3qj1,t1_cjvsgnv,t3_2e3qj1,null,1435344432,12,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,12

Can confirm: there is nothing to see here.


Essentially, it is possible that a more complex structure would need to be adopted by companies operating within an independent Scotland. However this would require nothing that would be new to multinationals. For smaller-medium sized companies it may require setting up a subsidiary or branch which operations are mapped to, possibly. This will to a degree depend on the transitional agreements that are negotiated etc. 


The idea that employment and other contracts would become null and void is inaccurate. To answer the question ""What is Scotland going to do to the English registered companies??"", they shouldn't have to do anything. The explanation gets a bit lengthy because it will depend on the operating model of the company, but I can confirm that this doomsday scenario is not the case.

It's really not. An example of modern day government-backed slavery might be forcing prisoners to do work, or face further punishment.

If you examine the nature of what Work Fare is, it's self evident that it can't be called slavery by any stretch. No one is forcing you to take the welfare payment that requires Work Fare participation - if you decline, then it's the universe that'll kill you from starvation, not Work Fare slave drivers.

Effectively the offer of acceptance is the JSA money for pushing this mop around. If you agree, you accept the money and work the menial work. If you disagree, you receive no money and do no work.

They are nice people, people who are just like we are culturally. I'm sure Aussies feel the same way about the UK. They've given us 'special arrangements' so we can immigrate there easier. You only need to pay a grand for a working visa, book your flights and you're set. You just keep extending the visa and apply for citizenship after X amount of time. So as long as you aren't a complete smack head you only need 2grand and you can move to Aus. I'd do this but I don't like spiders. I would genuinely have a heart attack if I seen a tarantula running up my wall. FUCK, THAT. 

But I'd brave the country and the spiders to protect its people. I know a lot of Aussies would feel the same way if the EU became hostile with us outside it towards us and tried to invade the UK. 

But should we lose our citizenship protecting Australia? If my government said that, I'd say goodbye for good and be in Australia instead. 

Now, in UK interests the people who go and fight for islamic states are fighting on grounds and feel strongly enough to lay down their lives NOT for the values we have, but for Islam and living in a theocracy. This is NOT IN LINE WITH OUR WAY OF LIFE IN THE WEST. So it's apples and oranges really.

I feel as long as each case is evaluated on a common sense, case by case basis.. that it would be alright. I wouldn't then lose my citizenship fighting for Australia and the Islamists who WANT TO LIVE SOLELY BY THE LAWS OF ALLAH AND UNDER A SYSTEM THAT SOLELY EXISTS TO HAVE EVERYBODY FOLLOWING THE KORAN.. if they want to lay down their lives fighting for that abroad, then they have no place within our borders.

To decline, and not receive payment. And then leave the Job Centre with all their negative rights intact.

Yeah, so? That's equally applicable to all offers of employment that suck. ""Take this job, or don't receive any money""

It's clearly meant to encourage people to go up through power brackets, and not go right in at a 1200cc bike and kill themselves, but who can afford all that? What 19 year old can afford to take all the lessons, tests, buy a bike with insurance and tax, and then do all that again when they're 24? All it's doing is forcing people to wait until they're 24 then going right in at a full power bike.

I fully understand the purpose behind it, but they need to adjust the brackets, to allow smaller, and more important cheaper bikes, available without doing the full lessons/tests, to encourage people to actually go through the brackets and learn to right properly

Letting someone who was 20 have a 250cc bike after maybe a 2 day course would be far more successful than the current system.

To be completely honest, it purely boils down to edcuation. Why did these people not learn as children what values we have as a country, and what we actually stand for in the global scheme of things? They should be proud of that. Dunno about you, but I like walking into tesco and people thinking from a mildly sarcastic stand point of 'yeah I don't wanna be here, but I am here so if you talk to me I've got some 'fuck off you prick' under my belt which I can portray in blunt dialog towards you'.. rather than going into tesco and seeing every woman dressed only showing their eyes with their husbands money, on their husbands time frame to get back home, ready to cook the tea which if it's late they deserve to be beaten for.. and anybody who isn't muslim deserves to be killed in the middle of tesco. 

I mean really, that's what people believe who are fighting abroad. Why the FUCK would you honestly go to a different country and fight for a completely muslim extreme way of life? Our society here in the UK and the west as a whole would simply not be able to function like that, our quality of life would deteriorate fast and the luxury we have of sitting here on our gaming PC's/smartphones/new technology just wouldn't continue happening...

Australia is just like we are, so are the Americans but they have enough people and a strong enough forces to protect themselves, as are Canada and I'd also volunteer for Canada with Americans if Russia attacked them.

Also, Liverpool with Suarez last year and without them this year is two, totally different teams, the second being something we've seen little of. I mean, if we're going strictly off of what we've seen recently, Coutinho and Lucas haven't been on tremendous form. If they were on the same team, would Coutinho and Lucas really be that much better a fit, and that much more skilled, that Lamela would for sure not be the starter? Some may say yes, some may say no, and given that it's a hypothetical question, we'll never know. But, if Lamela played for Liverpool, trained under their system, he surely has the makeup to give a run at a potential starting XI spot. At the same time, I don't think Gerrard would be displaced by any of our players, but I also don't think he'd start for us in our current system because he simply wouldn't have the lungs. That's what I've been saying this whole time, that this idea of any of these teams being top to down ""better"" based on players is bizarre. Even if all of our players, or none of our players could displace players from other top clubs, it wouldn't necessarily correlate to us being a ""better"" or ""worse"" team. Could our players find a place on some of those teams starting XI? Definitely. But, if they couldn't that still doesn't necessarily represent our chances at a good season. I personally think we have a well put together team for the first time in a couple years, and that's not me overrating our players and thinking they're world beaters, it's me thinking that we have numerous players who seem good enough to work in a system together.

As for Henderson's position, I think in Rodgers' teams once you get beyond the back four the positions are really more in name than action and its less about where you are and more about what you're being told to do. As for the pressing its something he has to condition himself to not be so active in (he gets too caught up in trying to be an all action midfielder still) and while that may be a hindrance defensively you'd have to think that his attacking threat more than makes up for it.

Sure, it was 'factual', but the insinuation being that modern day Muslims are lazy or somehow don't contribute 'their fair share' is obvious, or that by inherently being Muslim means you are therefore unproductive.

&gt;[THAT from and after the Union, the Coin shall be of the same Standard and Value throughout the United Kingdom, as now in England, and **a Mint shall be continued in Scotland; under the same Rules as the Mint in England**, and the present Officers of the Mint continued, subject to such Regulations and Alterations as Her Majesty, her Heirs or Successors, or the Parliament of Great Britain shall think fit.](http://www.rahbarnes.demon.co.uk/Union/UnionWithEnglandAct.htm#XVI)

Now this suggests the original plan at least was for Scotland and England to have equal ownership of the currency. Now Scotland does have it's own bank notes but it does not have a mint strangely enough (If anyone can tell me why, I'd like to know). But here's the thing. This isn't England's pound that Scotland is using, it's Scotland's pound too.

Now according to legislation.gov.uk (which for some strange reason doesn't publish the origional legistlation as passed), the part past ""as now in England"" was repealed by a mysterious bill called ""Statute Law Revision (Scotland) Act 1906 (c. 38)"" which isn't published on legislation.gov.uk nor can I find a text of it anywhere. If you can show me it I would be rather happy. However the original 1707 act suggests (since we do or did have the right to an independent Mint) Scotland has equal ownership of the Currency. If you want to read the original 1707 act, [click here](http://www.rahbarnes.demon.co.uk/Union/UnionWithEnglandAct.htm).

Now here's a question, if an independent Scotland cannot use the pound as it is outside of the UK, what about the Isle of Man and the Channel Isles. These are both not part of the UK but they happily use the pound anyway. Now before you shout ""but they are Crown dependencies"" I would like to point you toward the group of Islands formerly known as The Netherlands Antilles. These are, in effect, Dutch crown dependencies *but* Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten all use their own currencies. The Dutch Caribbean use the US Dollar. So it's not like being a crown dependency of somewhere gives you the right to use their currency, the UK just does so anyway. Even before joining the Eurozone the Antilles still used their own currencies. So tell me, why do you allow the IoM and the Channel Islands to use the pound. If an independent Scotland can't use the pound outside the UK, neither should the Channel Isles and the IoM.

TL;DR: This is all just politicking arseholery. Until I see a bit of legislation saying otherwise, Scotland can keep the pound. ",1,1408564710,null,0,false,0,cjvu90c,t3_2e231g,t1_cjvu90c,t3_2e231g,null,1435345754,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

This isn't a sixth form essay. What I mean is that the BoE currently serves Scotland as part of the UK and Scotland's interests therefore factor into the decisions made on Threadneedle Street. That will stop if Scotland gets independence, but Scotland will continue to be bound by the Bank's decisions. Currently Scotland influences the Bank's thinking by virtue of being part of the UK. Independence will stop that. (Worth noting it was a Scot who was behind the Bank becoming independent of Government).



Saying that the Bank of England doesn't care about anywhere but London is just wrong. There's not even an argument. It would be impossible for the Bank to fulfil its remit if it only focused on London. 


I'm not going to dig out sources for you on the last point, do a bit of googling if you're interested. It's common sense basically. An untested new currency is risky for investors, meaning the Scottish Government will be forced to offer much higher bond yields, making Government borrowing much more expensive. Similarly, businesses, especially FS which make up a big enough chunk of the Scottish economy for this to be a big problem, will be totally unwilling to take on significant currency risk when they can easily move across the border to the safety of Stirling. This is all made worse by the fact that Salmond has been mouthing off about defaulting on debt.

What you have described has been a problem since YTS was rolled out around thirty years ago.

The government has always been aware of the fact that the majority of young people in these schemes are taken on with no intention of ultimately employing them, or in providing them with any transferable skills.  Being aware of this and having done nothing to tighten up the rules they are absolutely complicit in the abuse that occurs.

The problem, however, is that no government since the early seventies has believed that it is the responsibility of government to ensure full, or near-full employment but they still want to massage the figures to hide their failure.

Fucking no.

A low paying job isn't brutal plantation slavery during the Atlantic slave trade, where your life expectancy in work was perhaps 2 years, you would be executed if you tried to flee, and where even the journey across the Atlantic itself would kill you. It isn't sex slavery, which is akin to being raped multiple times a day for sometimes decades. It isn't even 1% as bad as those things.

I'm 19 and I've been working since I was 18. My first job was working at Morrisons. It was hard work (as hard as you make it sound yours is) for £6.70 an hour with a 12 hour contract. I did this for 2 years while I also did college 20 hours a week. I'd make £80 a week with this job, but I'd have lots of spare time. I enjoyed it. The management were a bunch of stagnated cunts too comfortable to be bothered moving in their lives so they did as little as possible to avoid being fired and happily collected their paycheck.

My second job was working in a hotel. As I had college &amp; a previous job under my belt, this one was better. It was a 0 hours contract but after a two week initiation period they had I established myself as a hardworker and was given at minimum 30 hours week since then. They paid £8.40 an hour. Some weeks I did 60 hours, the true beauty of 0 hour contracts. I didn't mind. I was getting £1000 monthly paychecks. But here too the management were stagnated cunts who were too comfortable where they were to actually work their best and made the young people do all the hard work for them.

I've since left those jobs and gone to university thanks to college. But what I learned is that you will be disrespected and mistreated as a naive young person. You can be exploited so easily because you are young. I've never had to deal with an apprentiship though.

What I would reccomend is using what you've learned and experience gained through this to find a part-time job which isn't an apprenticeship. You can do 20 hours a week at the minimum wage of £6.31 and earn more than your apprenticeship. The trick is to not let you be exploited by managereal cunts who have no progression left in their lives who are happy to fester in their shit-tier positions while taking out their inadequacey on the young people they employ to do all the leg work. If you don't let them order you around you'll quickly find a minimum of work you're required to complete without being fired, and this is the best you can do in low-tier part time jobs, until you find out what you really want to do.",0,1408567053,null,0,false,0,cjvvjqc,t3_2e2yp0,t1_cjvvjqc,t3_2e2yp0,null,1435346656,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,beyondReturn,null,null,"There are two reasons this might happen. First off if BR tells the owners that the difference between almost guaranteeing top 4 and title challenge+CL challenge, and just about getting into top 4 is a player that will cost 1/6 of Suarez transfer fee and Suarez yearly wages then they might just do it.


Suarez has 4 year (?) contract, we sold approximately each of those years for £18.7M, he also had wages of £10M a year that gives the club a return of £28.7M a year for the next 4 years. If there is a player that will cost the club 70% of that and can realistically return 80% of Suarez presence then why not? This is all just the second part, for the fist part the club has to do a simpler math, maintain the quality of the previous seasons squad (replace Suarez) and strengthen it with depth to the point where ManU won't have a better squad on paper. This is assuming Everton/Spurs aren't as great challenge as ManU. Do that and you go from risking losing the CL money, actually challenging (the club has revenue of 300M if less than 10% of that is what takes them from not winning anything to winning something, it's relatively little).


This is based on 2 things, the core of sabermetric (why have 300M squad that has a significant weakness worth a fraction of that) and FSG overall plan. They will never again commit to the Torres/Carroll deal, but just look at their reasoning. We will pay for Carroll whatever we get for Torres minus  £15M. They deal in the sum of the result and not the individual transfers, therefore Suarez' contribution has been given a pricetag of wages and fee and you just have to compare the end product you expect of Falcao with that of Suarez. If Falcao is expected to produce 80% of LS, then you can take that sum and not ask if Falcao really is worth this or that. But it's also much better than a long term deal, Liverpool get to spend 70% of Suarez seasonal worth on another player and not have to commit to 4 year deal. They get to test him out, take their time to find another target next season, and if he flops he will have cost the club  £20M.


We loaned AC to WHU for £2M plus the £5M in wages, that is  £7M for a season of Carroll, then we sold the ""rights"" to the next 3 seasons for £5M each season. Essentially Falcao will go for 3 times what Carroll went for to WHU. His rights over 4 seasons would be worth 15M each, so a loan of 2/3 that isn't too ridiculous. Loans have previously been given to out of favor players, this is now a different situation that requires a different sort of thinking, we are getting 1/4 of Falcaos contract for £10M excluding wages, it's not possible for him to go for £40M, but that is the rate we are paying. They are expecting his value to go up and warrent a club bidding £45M or so next year and put the total of his worth at £55M for 4 years.",0,1408567166,null,0,false,0,cjvvm07,t3_2e3qj1,t1_cjvvm07,t3_2e3qj1,null,1435346703,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

 - IBM - what open platform do they offer? Their mainframes are well supported and you can still run software from the '60s, but they're not open platforms by any stretch. There's AIX, of course - again not open, but as it's Unix, it's a damn sight closer to open. You'd still need the supplier to test and support their application(s) against newer versions of AIX as older ones are deprecated.
 - Sun - exactly the same thing can be said about Solaris as AIX.
 - Oracle - Are we talking about packages or platforms? Oracle do have their financials management package, but like all commercial packages you can't just buy it once then forget about it forever; not unless you want some serious pain when all support is finally dropped. Regarding Oracle's database package - you wouldn't want to run an expensive line-of-business application with an unsupported database on the backend so you'd still want to keep the database - and by extension whatever OS you run it on - reasonably up to date.
 - Red Hat - were still very much in startup mode in the first half of the '90s. As their only OS is Linux, I would refer you to my original answer: Commercial applications are only really supportable longterm if you have the source code.
 - Novell - Are you serious? They spent most of the 90s floundering with a rapid series of acquisitions that they promptly sold off; Netware marketshare plummeted as Windows became a viable server OS.

true,[deleted],null,null,"You're 20. I'm 26. I make seriously decent money and I have no qualifications. I have not been where you are, working for money that shit.. but surely, do you not think to yourself 'stacking shelves in tesco will pay more'? Genuine question, why don't you think like that? 

Also mate, you are putting up with bullshit. If you go to college and ask them 'what do you offer', you NEED TO THIS. You're getting fuck all qualifications by doing an apprenticeship. You my friend, are just cheap labour. 

People here will bash the tories, bash appreciateship wage, and you'll get nothing that will help you. Apprenticeships are for qualifications. You need a mechanics qualification, a tiling or plastering qualification, plumbing qualification, or something you can have that says 'I can do that job', and apply for a company with behind you that will make them say 'yeah we'll hire him'. That's what an apprenticeship is for mate, so you can apply and get a proper job at the end of it.. working for your dads mate killing yourself feeding his dog is just you getting taken for a mug. 

So from now, what do you do? If you can continue to afford life on a shit wage, take that hit and accept it. Get a propper apprenticeship with a qualification that lets you apply to a company at the end of it, simple as that mate.. one through a college. So you're in college 2 days a week and working the remaining three days. I looked into this when I was about 23, about 3 years ago and was basically already too old. 

Now mate, I have worked bar work, managed a bar, worked other sectors, now I work in sales. I fucking PUSH LIKE FUCK EVERY SINGLE DAY TO CLOSE EVEN THE PETTIEST OF SALES, and laugh when it's pay day. I have a team now behind me, I pressurise them every day into hitting what I hit. They get paid well better than they would in tesco's and the next day after pay day I sit them down and talk for about 10mins about why what they do is getting them more money and although it's hard, picking up 15hundred quid after taxes with no qualifications is not something to take for granted. We don't want to pay you, you get the money because I help you get that and etc, they're all well off and can only get paid more. A proper sales job mate will see you set if you put the same work in you did as brushing the fare off some guys dog lol, remember where you are now forever. 

All in all mate, there genuinely are opportunities out there you need to think about what money you get paid now, where the money is, how much of a pay cut can you take on a 3yr apprenticeship which isn't a bullshit one and will lead to proper money and if not, go and work in tesco's mate it's about 8quid a hr on nights I heard.

true,shotglass21,eng-GreaterLondon,London AKA civilisation,"&gt; Shortening Japanese to Jap is comparable to shortening British to Brit.

No it isn't, the term 'Jap' has been used as a insult towards the Japanese people for a very time, the same can't be said of the term 'Brit'; but of course you already know this.

&gt; Language evolves and I have not heard it used as such for at least 15 years.

Just because you personally haven't heard it used that way yourself, that doesn't mean the term is now completely transformed from being a disparaging slur towards an ethnic people to simple nickname like 'Brit' or 'Swede'. If it were the case the case that a term has become phased out of use, that doesn't stop the term from being a relic of racism. For example, it would be completely unacceptable to refer to black person as a 'negro' or a Chinese person as a 'Chinaman', due to the historical context.

Given that the debt is guaranteed by the Bank of England and not a hypothetical scottish lender of last resort and that leading figures in the Scottish government have ultimately said the debt will be taken on in return for a currency union I'm going to have to disagree on that point.

&gt; why should Scotland get to skip out on the debt that it has clearly benefited from.

The debt is the responsibility of the successor state which is the UK. The Bank of England has guaranteed the debt in the event of a Yes vote and Scottish rebuttal of the debt.The Scottish government's plan A involves taking on a population share of debt which is the fair and reasonable thing to do, they are not legally obliged to do this, it is part of the negotiation in regards to the formation of a currency union. 

&gt; while losing ~10% of its income

&gt; again this is a result of Scottish independence and would happen even with a currency union.

Yes but with a currency union you will have a lower level of debt and hence it will be cheaper for rUK to borrow money.

Last time I checked, we use a system of 'innocent until proven guilty' in our country. If someone is a terrorist, and has committed an act of terrorism (which, with our current vague anti-terrorism laws, could literally be anything), they will be tried in a court of law and convicted. If you are suggesting that they remove the citizenship of people who cannot be found guilty in a caught of law, you are quite literally undermining our entire legal system, and the idea that we should adhere to the laws of this country.

If Scot's Law wasn't already independent then [this usually happens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_statute) when you leave the commonwealth:

&gt; Reception statutes generally consider the English common law dating prior to independence, and the precedents originating from it, as the default law, because of the importance of using an extensive and predictable body of law to govern the conduct of citizens and businesses in a new state. 

HOWEVER, Westminster drastically changed employment law a couple of years ago and you now need to have two years continuous employment with the same company to have the basic rights we all once enjoyed. Any company in the UK can sack someone any time they wanted. Oh, and if you want to challenge the decision there's a £600 tax just to initiate it! This shit is exactly why we want to cut ties with Westminster.

Finally, both Scots and English law are ""common law"" systems and it's quite common for them to [borrow judgements from other countries as precedents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stare_decisis#Courts_in_other_jurisdictions).

I could say ""this putting people who have murdered others in prison malarky is a dangerous precedent, what happens when the government starts putting people in prison for other things it doesn't like?!"" The point of course being that it is already against people's human rights to be put in prison for a uniform set of reasons because of human rights legislation, so that protection is already in place. For instance you can't put someone in prison for voting for Labour. 

It is not impossible to legislate for this situation in such a way that we don't have to put up with the dangerous precedent you want to set. Which is that people can ideologically radicalise themselves, then go off and become hardened fighters for a cause that is the exact opposite of what our society stands for, vow to fight our society, then come back and cause carnage. The difference between my dangerous precedent and yours is that yours is 100% going to happen if we don't do something.

It doesn't undermine our system if we say you have renounced our society and therefore we accept your renouncing and you can stay out. They have pretty much committed treason with their behaviour.  

But like I said, my inclination is to put them away in prison for a very long period of time if we can prove they were there fighting regardless of the activity we can or cannot show they were involved in. But once again we're left in a farcical situation that is bound to cost us millions upon millions.

Myself, I think it's time for Scotland to leave the Union. I think Wales and Northern Ireland should be given the chance of constitutional referendum. And I think England should be afforded the chance to consider the same issues.

You're misinterpreting this. Firstly iScotland has no legal obligation to take this debt, secondly it is offering to take it on as part of the negotiation process.

&gt; Enter a credit union with Scotland and effectively be responsible for all future Scottish debt including the debt Scotland has taken on, from now until Scotland decide it is no longer in its best interest.

This is incorrect, the UK will not be responsible for debt taken on by an independent Scotland. To suggest so is highly speculative. 

&gt; I'll tell you now they will take the first option, and penalize Scotland with trade sanctions for refusing to take there share

No they won't. Whilst sanctions would obviously hurt iScotland more than rUK, they would screw rUK badly given that Scotland is its second largest trading partner, thats a lot of business fucked, a lot of people losing their jobs, a lot of mortgages defaulted on and you'd still have all the debt. The debt markets are not going to lend to you at a decent rate if you are willing to fuck up your own economy out of spite.

His cross taking ability is second to none, like legitimately. He's confident, his decision making is similar to that of a 15 year veteran, not a 22 year old on his first start at a new club. Over the last season or 2, one of our biggest defensive frailties has been defending set pieces/crosses. Tremendous amount of goals conceded off of set pieces, or balls in and around the edge of the 6. Courtois uses every inch of his frame, and seriously dominates the goal. 

Shot stopping wise, he's just as good if not better than Cech. He reads the play well, his positioning is tremendous, he's rather agile for such a large man too. 

Tactically he's very good, well off his line when he has too. Organizes the team well as noted in the video.

Distribution wise he's a bit suspect. Yes he played a cracking volley to Drogba, but his distribution was an issue even at Atletico. Conditions were horrendous with swirling winds Monday night, so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt, but if there's an area he needs to improve it is that.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt; Say what you like about NHS bureaucracy, but at least it records what people are doing.

Very true, but personally, I've had better care privately.  About one month after uni, I started my job, a stressful one, but it had good benefits, including private health care.  My boss was also an asthmatic, he heard me wheezing as we walked up the stairs, I was lugging coffees, the coffeeshop was in a basement sub-level.  I got to the first floor and he dismisses me, I'm to see a Dr, the firm has an agreement with a practice just up the road.  Not even ten minuites from my boss saying, see the Dr, red door opposite liverpool street station, I'm checked in, they just look at my work ID and that's it.

The Dr was bemused, *why are you still taking beclomethasone?  I'm putting you on salbutamol*, a short walk to boots and a staggering £120 prescription fee, within two days, the difference was amazing.  I went from struggling to walk two flights of stares to jogging, then cycling.  That £120 is absolutely nothing compared to the impact on my life, I became a healthy weight, I now normally get a good hour+ of cardio every day.  I will live longer, cost the NHS less.

It's hard to understand what a difference to my life such a drug can make.  But a private doctor, not having hands bound by NICE changed my life radically.

I struggled at the time, ended up changing GP, because when I mentioned to my NHS doctor that this other doctor had prescribed this drug to me, she didn't even know it existed, looking it up in her reference text, she even got the dosage wrong (eeep!).

I was very, very lucky to work for a firm which had such benefits, to have a boss who doesn't take ""oh that's just what I sound like normally"" as an answer.  If I wasn't a skilled person, working for a in demand sector (software / maths) I would no doubt not have received this drug for 5 years.",0,1408572228,null,0,false,0,cjvy9cn,t3_2e38bi,t1_cjvy9cn,t1_cjvxi7c,null,1435348009,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

true,34Mbit,eng-Bristol,Bristol,"&gt;Those who refuse get no money, those with no money can't buy food, those with no food starve to death, it is slavery.

That's not slavery, that's poverty, it's a completely different thing.

&gt;We have a minimum wage yet those on workfare can receive less than a quarter of it.

Being paid less than the minimum wage is a regular thing. Those on minimum wage pay income tax and national insurance contributions. Those under 21 and 18 are paid lower rates. Being paid a low amount isn't bondage or enslavement.

&gt;Don't forget that many of the unemployed have worked and paid into the system for many years, only to find that the rules get changed when they need it.

The government reneging on a welfare benefit isn't enslavement.

&gt;Remember too that those on workfare are paid for by the taxpayer.

Still not slavery.

&gt;He undercuts his competitors and forces more onto the dole.

That's an economic consequence of a stupid government policy, like how the rain is a consequence of the weather and climate. Again, nothing to do with slavery.

Work Fare is shit, it's unfair, it doesn't help anyone, it's a waste of money, and it's harmful to the economy. It isn't slavery though.

I gave up on the idea of properly completing it long, long ago! I'm still missing one or two of the outfits, which does distress me slightly :(

There really is! I'm glad you go by horseback - the Magical Quick Travel Campfire^^^TM is cheating! The world is phenomenal, yes, and I think some of the most enjoyable moments in the game come from doing the supposedly mundane stuff. For instance, the part where you help herd the cattle and bring them in. Hardly glamorous but at that point it felt like a Wild West cattle-hand simulator, and I bloody loved it.

Being unable to see this kind of thing directly, uncensored and unedited, insulates our society from reality beyond our back yard. People would be much more outraged about the war in Ukraine or bombings in Gaza if they saw the utterly repugnant shreds of human remains that result. Sterile news coverage of blown-out empty vehicles, wreckage, or rubble... they don't have the emotional weight. Contrasted with the famous picture of the withered, blackened Iraqi corpse from the 'Highway of Death' in 1991... We remove the human element these days, which helps us really not think about the people in a conflict.


I'm *not* saying news should all be 'Wooo! Severed limbs!', but the *ability to access* this kind of thing uncensored/uncut helps us as a society see reality a little more sharply - If we choose to.

&gt;""Slavery"" means, as defined in the Slavery Convention of 1926, the status or condition of a person over whom any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership are exercised, and ""slave"" means a person in such condition or status

The ECHR uses the same definition of slavery as the 1926 Slavery Convention. Its definition of servitude or serfdom is

&gt;the obligation to perform certain services for others ... the obligation for the “serf” to live on another person’s property and the impossibility of altering his condition

'Forced labour' is

&gt;“forced or compulsory labour” means “all work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily”

You can take your copy of Collins English Dictionary to the ECHR though. The ECHR publish their slavery trial details online, and there are examples of girls as young as 15 working for years as domestic servants with no pay, unable to leave their workplaces, that failed to meet the qualification of slavery.

Even if he hadn't there's a presumed responsibility that adults take for their lives so that even if they find themselves in heinous situations they are still players with agency in those acts.

That said, I think /u/BraveSirRobin is misrepresenting the situation here as regards to the 'independece' of the Bank of England. The BoE might very well have independence when it comes to setting the interest rate, but its goal - an inflation rate (e.g. 3%) - is set by the government in Westminster. Additionally, the inflation rate is determined by conditions within the UK, so presumably the rate of inflation in Scotland will no longer factor into their decisions (except as a secondary consideration).

Personally, I think that the inflation rate in independent Scotland and the UK would stay fairly close together for quite a while regardless, but eventually they'll diverge and *that's* when an independent Scotland would suffer.

All that said, though, I hope you - and the rest of Scotland - don't vote for independence. I live in the north of England, and to be honest my position is based entirely upon my feelings toward Scottish people. I like you guys a lot. To be honest, I don't really think the UK would work without Scotland. It'd probably be only a matter of time until we broke down (even though that'd probably hurt you just as much) without you, but even if it wasn't, I'm a little afraid the New UK would shift so far to the right that our national character will change for the worse.

It'd be so stupid if this independence referendum stopped being about the advantages and disadvantages and became about national pride, expressed only in dismissing the 'other side'. I think that it's sad that many English people seem not to understand the important of Scotland to the UK, even if that's probably just because they've never left gone north of the Watford Gap, but I hope that you can ignore them (and their downvotes :/ ) and the way they're behaving like we don't need you, because, frankly, plenty more of us recognise that we do.",0,1408575434,null,0,1408575717,0,cjvztgy,t3_2e231g,t1_cjvztgy,t1_cjvi9u7,null,1435348771,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It should be remembered that the government retains control of the final objective of monetary policy - the Government sets the inflation target within which the Bank must operate when carrying out monetary policy decisions.

Though it obviously is an influence, the religion and religious authority/beaurocracy isn't separate from society and always has very profane motives. 

If you put adherents of the same book into the home counties and the war torn parts of northern Uganda you are going to get different outcomes, the same with Islam. In Turkey, that has undergone a modern nation state formation process, the large and cosmopolitan cities are not all that different from the rest of Europe with Muslims [drinking, generally having liberal values](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7873081.stm) and scientific programs etc, that is very different from Saudi Arabia or Sudan and you could expect a similar secularisation process if those countries changed economically.  I do accept that the vested interests are obviously a part of why those countries don't modernise, but a fairly small part in the case of most of the third world imo. 

Also Britain has had some involvement in this, one of the reasons Britain invaded Egypt under mehmet Ali is that he was (crudely) experimenting with modernising the country and a rival in the middle east wouldn't be stood for.

With regards to the doctor checking the inhaler - Were you prescribed one of the branded salbutamol inhalers?  We use generics when prescribing so named inhalers are often foreign - there are 7 proprietary salbutamol inhalers in the BNF - and the only one I've heard of is ventolin - the rest are pretty obscure and only 2 of them have salbutamol in the name.

true,AcaiPalm,lfc68,,"He's a world renowned striker, and I agree that a lot of his publicity stems from his terrible behavior, which doesn't really fit our 'model'. But if you want a discussion, here's my two cents:

The only reason we all know young Mario so well is because of his incredible talent, if he didn't have this extraordinary talent he would just be another footballer with too much money and too little sense. But if our club wants to make an impression in the footballing world, we either buy the best players in the world, or take a risk and play a unique brand of vibrant attacking football. We saw this last year where we played most of our games on the front foot with two strikers, going all out to score as many goals as was humanely possible because Breandao knew we couldn't stop the other team from scoring. To me Mario constitutes another risk, if FSG spend £20 million bringing him here, he may turn up and score 20 goals which will guarantee champions league for next season, or he may even lead us to bigger things. The down side is that he may not really turn up at all, and we end up looking a bit silly, but then again that's nothing new for us (Andy Carroll, £35 million, if you need any reminding). Worst case scenario, we sell him on in 1-2 seasons for a loss. But alas there will always be someone willing to buy him because of his talent, someone else will be willing to buy him because football is a business and in business people take risks because there's always a chance they can pay off in a big big way. Even if it doesn't work out, we play one striker (Sturridge) and we have Mario Balotelli on the bench. Let me remind you that he is the type of player who can come on and win a game all by himself with a few moments of brilliance.

true,mostly_posts_drunk,cnty-england,comfortably numb,"&gt; But would that really be a freedom worth sacrificing? Do we really want to cripple freedom of speech in this country even more?

No. If anything it should be the opposite - that we should have a more complete freedom of speech, perhaps not quite to the extent of the USA, for example denying people entry to the UK when it's obvious their only reason for coming here is to inflame and cause public disorder (ie: westboro baptist church) is (arguably) for the best.

But otherwise I think (and I realise I might be in the minority on this) it's as you say; if you make *certain forms or topics* of speech illegal it does nothing to stop it, it just drives it into private spheres of influence, places where people of similar minds will eventually conjugate together and build a self-reinforcing echo-chamber for their own ideas. 

If there is a group of people within our society who claim that our way of living is immoral or decedent or worthy of extermination or murder or whatever, then I want to hear from them, and I want them to be able to legally and freely say what they think for three simple reasons;

1. If you have freedom to say these things then you're more likely to say them without trying to hide yourself, or disguise your actual thoughts and ideas behind lies and platitudes.
2. If you say and think these things, I want to know who you are, so I can at least cross the street when I see you, and hope that someone else is paying attention and keeping an eye on you.
3. I want the same freedom to criticise your religious based ideas as you have to criticise my secular ones, and forget any idea of any special protections for any side, if you claim for example that homosexuality is an abomination while hiding behind the idea that that is a religious belief, then I should have an equal right to critique your religious beliefs and your religion as a whole, if you say that my society is decedent then I get to tell you how your ideals are bullshit. At the very least a discussion is had, nothing might be solved but at least we have an equal right to criticize each other's thoughts.

&gt;The newspaper cited the words of unnamed police officers and [Conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK\)) [MP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament) for Sheffield Hallam Irvine Patnick for information relating to the alleged incidents.   *The Daily Express* also carried Patnick's version, under the headline ""Police Accuse Drunken Fans"" and giving Patnick's views, saying he had told Margaret Thatcher, while escorting her on a tour of the ground after the disaster, of the ""mayhem caused by drunks"" and that policemen told him they were ""hampered, harassed, punched and kicked"". 

&gt;The story accompanying the *Sun* headlines claimed ""drunken Liverpool fans viciously attacked rescue workers as they tried to revive victims"" and ""police officers, firemen and ambulance crew were punched, kicked and urinated upon"". A quotation, attributed to an unnamed policeman, claimed a dead girl had been ""abused"", and that Liverpool fans were ""openly urinating on us and the bodies of the dead"".  These allegations contradicted the behaviour of many Liverpool fans, who helped security personnel stretcher away a large number of victims and gave first aid to many of the injured.

Although of course if you had a firm offer of a job you'd be stopping Jobseekers Allowance anyway when the job starts, so it's a bit redundant. ""The only way you can stay on this benefit is providing proof that you are not entitled to this benefit"". Hopefully it won't be that strict though, it's all quite new since they only started doing these assessments in July this year.

But the benefits stopping wouldn't mean you can't stay here. You wouldn't be tracked down and deported, you'd just be left to fend for yourself without access to any state benefits. And you still might be able to claim benefits even if you weren't a worker or jobseeker as long as you were a caring for British children (e.g. Polish mother to British-citizen children), or a family member of a worker, or if you were 'legally resident' here for five years (i.e. you'd worked or cared for British children here for that long).

true,Melberger,1972crest,,"In their time at Barcelona Txiki and Soriano's policy was to have players on a relatively modest basic wage, with bonuses granted for individual success and the team's trophy haul.

This would mean that with several trophies that a player's wage would be considerable.

This meant that if the club had an unsuccessful season the players wouldn't pick up giant wage packages.

Essentially it rewards success. It gives further incentive to the players to be successful, and truly earn their hefty wage. The logic is that if we're successful we can afford to play the players well, if we're unsuccessful we save tens of millions from wage bonuses.

I also think, but I could be wrong, that it means a player would be easier to sell in such a structure. Take for example players who no longer make the grade at City, we often struggle to sell them to prospective buyers due to their old high basic wage and their prospective new club refusing to meet that wage, and the player refusing to take a pay cut. Thus we often end up sending cast-offs on loan and having to subsidise part of their salary, or in the case of Adebayor, selling them for well below their market value so the buying club can afford to pay their absurd, well above market value wage.

This was a big problem when we were dishing out £90k a week to the likes of Wayne Bridge. He had several subsidised loan moves and ran his contract out in the end.

Thankfully, we're now much better run.

To my knowledge, the bonuses wouldn't be considered in contract negotiations for a player wishing to sign a contract at another club, and the buying club would only be expected to meet the basic wage with the bonuses not taken into account.

Also, we have given 5 year contracts to most of the players as they're in their peak. A few whose futures aren't as stonewall as a Kompany for example, like Kolarov or Dzeko, due to age or deemed longevity and quality, were offered 3 and 4 year deals respectively.",0,1408578242,null,0,false,0,cjw13zp,t3_2e4nn6,t1_cjw13zp,t3_2e4nn6,null,1435349735,6,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,6

I see no assumptions in what I said, unless you're going to go as far as saying that my use of the word ""trash"" is not a synonym of ""quite average"". I can see where some people would say those words aren't interchangeable, but given the tone of your original statement, the term ""quite average"" seemed to allow for the synonym usage. Sorry if this was somehow an assumption. 

You posted this thread and you're the one who ambiguously put down all Spurs players in a unthought, blanket statement that only two of our players could ever get into the starting XI of any top 4 teams. I simply pointed out the flaw in your logic by stating multiple players who could be in the starting XI for other teams. Kyle Walker being one of them, Lamela being another. I also pointed out how your argument is confusing because I still don't know what you mean by ""even get in any top 4 teams"". Do you mean right now with players not rested fully from the world cup? Do you mean ever? Do you mean at all of our players highest form? I still don't know what you mean, and if that's what allowed for me to say something that you disagreed with, I apologize that I had to make assumptions to fill in your hole-filled argument.

true,thewholeisgreater,eng-Worcestershire,Worcestershire,"If you read all of Dawkins' works it's clear that he has an amazing but unflinchingly scientific/philosophical frame of mind that I believe somewhat stems from the reductionist nature of his field and research. When questions like this are posed to him they probably don't even seem controversial. He sees it as a balance of positives weighed against negatives and the only possible conclusion is the one stated because:

1. Embryologists concur that there is *at least* 6 months of the foetus' formation where it doesn't even have the necessary biological pathways to 'experience' anything (e.g. pain). Tests for downs syndrome start between two and three months so to Dawkins, a foetus is just a multicellular cluster which happens to be gestating in a womb. If you find early on that one multicellular cluster would be outperformed by another with greater potential to create the greatest amount of happiness for the greatest number of people (I'm pretty sure Dawkins is utilitarian in this respect), then why on earth wouldn't you choose the latter?

2. As social beings we have certain responsibilities if we want to survive. This includes firstly reproduction, and secondly parents showing a level of care/altruism towards their offspring in order that those offspring can grow to become useful and altruistic members of society themselves. They can then reproduce and the cycle continues. Unfortunately raising a child with Downs Syndrome *can* be very difficult for a great number of people. Some stick with it and have a difficult time, some have an incredibly rewarding time. Sadly many can't hack it and the child ends up going into care. Actions like this result in the particular human being a drain on society with nothing to contribute. Ergo, their existence is against the interests of the society as a whole. In this respect Dawkins clearly sees the immorality in knowingly and **illogically** acting to the detriment of society as a whole, when another option was available. Another way you could look at it (but probably shouldn't) is that most Downs Syndrome sufferers won't have the support or interactions they need to form a real relationship and reproduce. They are statistically likely to be the end of the germ-line which, from the level of the gene through the organism to the social group level, is kind of pointless.

The main downside to his immutable logic is that it completely disregards the very real emotions attached to the *imagined potential* people have for their unborn multicellular clusters. However as a scientist and mathematician, that's not his concern. His concern is 1+1=2; sience and logic dictate this is an easy choice to make. Needless to say such a sensitive topic is probably not one that Dawkins should be publicly reducing to such a cold and mathematical level. However, on the flip side somebody asked him a question and he gave the logical, scientific and debatably philosophically correct answer.

In my opinion Dawkins should get the fuck off twitter. I have an inordinate amount of love for the man and his work and seeing him getting into these pissing fights on social media really upsets me because I can see it damaging his legacy. I wish somebody would just lock him in a chamber somewhere so he could carry on writing books.  

I should stress that nothing I wrote here is necessarily my own opinion, just my perspective on Dawkins' reasoning.",0,1408579020,null,0,false,0,cjw1gv1,t3_2e3bik,t1_cjw1gv1,t3_2e3bik,null,1435349879,63,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,63

edit: but seriously there is nothing wrong with having three young talented strikers in a similar mould.

If we have Sturridge, Balotelli, Origi who can all compete for spaces across the front 3/ as part of a striking partnership, plus backup in Lambert, not to mention our attacking mids who are mostly very flexible we can be absolutely deadly.

I'm not sure how much of an effect it would have on science participation if Dawknis converted half the populaion of Sudan to non religion, but if it began to develop in the way Britain or Japan have done, then society would eventually become much more secular and there would be a need for scientific culture, the same thing happened in every state in the transition from feudalism. 

I guess that institutionalised religion is one of the reasons that there aren't people who want development in some third world countries, but like I said I think this is a marginal one. 

It's obviously complicated but  I think that religion is associated with insecurity in peoples lives, it offers a psychological salve for it and when people become less insecure (and modern society has alternatives to the other stuff religion offers people, collective feeling, fun, etc) religious feeling drops. I think it's not all that much of a co-incidence that church attendance started to decline precipitously as the NHS and other welfare state measures started to come on line and as youth culture started to become popular.  In Ireland you can see this is still happening as development has broken the power of the Church.

true,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,"I think a few reasons:

* No one's expecting our team to nail the high pressure system perfectly right out of the blocks.  It'll take a few games, and we were never able to settle into this one because of the card.

* We're notoriously slow starters in matches over the last few seasons.  We really need to work on this - Liverpool specialise in being 2 or 3 goals up in the first half hour, which is why they've been so devastating recently.  We seem to always show up late, which meant that due to the red, we never got into a place where we could press, and instead did the good ol' Spursy thing of scoring a late goal.

* West Ham really pushed us back well in the first half hour, especially leading up to the pen.  It's very hard to press effectively when you're on the back foot the whole time.  I think they caught us unawares a bit with how intense they started - we didn't have the composure or discipline to hold our ground and press back against them.

* But finally, the most important reason I think... we didn't have much pace up front.  Pressing is instigated usually by one of the two furthest forward players, and is best executed when you have quick players up there, particularly players that have explosive acceleration over the first 15-20 yards.  It catches opposition defenders out and forces them to make mistakes and turn the ball over.

Against the Hammers, Adebayor didn't look fit, and can be a pretty lackadaisical player at the best of times.  Eriksen is not that quick, nor does he have a high defensive workrate.  Lamela is pretty quick, but not the kind of pace that terrifies other players.  Lennon was the only one who started who could do it, but his defensive workrate and diligence is often so good that it meant he played quite deep and thus was unable to start the high press, and if he did, he wasn't hugely supported by his teammates immediately around him.

I was really surprised that Soldado didn't play a part, because even though not the quickest, he presses better.  Townsend definitely has the kind of pace you want up there, and he really made a difference when he came on.

Ultimately I think if we want to play a 4-2-3-1 system with Lamela and Eriksen both being on the field at the same time, we need a quick player to complement them who is going to stay high, kick-start the team's pressing, and/or make lung-bursting runs from slightly deeper.  Lennon doesn't fully fit the mould unless he has Walker behind him, which allow him to play higher up.  Townsend could do it, but he needs to work on a lot of areas of his game to make it really effective.

Ideally we would buy a high quality LW to fit the bill before the transfer window closes.",0,1408582511,null,0,false,0,cjw3326,t3_2e4r0s,t1_cjw3326,t3_2e4r0s,null,1435350795,31,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,31

And it's not just nobel prizes.  You could look at look at other measures of scientific output and you'll see that the Islamic world is not producing much.

As far as black Nobel laureates.  I don't know what the figures are for science Nobels, but let's assume they're proportionately quite low.  And I think there's probably a partly similar explanation at play!  Blacks are historically more likely to come from intellectually impoverished nations or communities, where there isn't the same tradition of intellectualism.  The difference however is that Islamic resistance to intellectualism is probably due to their shared ideology.  But, the same can't be true of black people everywhere, because members of a racial class wouldn't be expected to  share a similar ideas.  So, it's more likely to me that enlightenment ideas were taking a relatively long time to spread to black populations, perhaps partly because of racism.

I'll even make some predictions!  Black people are going to start making a bigger contribution to science as intellectualism spreads throughout black populations.  I expect to see more African universities and more research coming out of Africa.  However, I also predict that Islamic populations will largely remain left behind in the knowledge production game until religion starts releasing its hold.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"I really hope you read this, and that it helps you sort things out.

To frame this, I'm in my mid 20s in a job that pays £45k a year. But I've also languished in low pay and exploitative jobs when I was your age. I'll start off by saying things WERE easier for me then, the minimum wage offered more protection whereas now it has been subverted with these apprenticeships. HOWEVER, at the same time the jobs market is recovering and there is plenty of good work for youngsters, but it is competitive.

You should use what's happening to re-evaluate your situation. It sounds like you have put yourself in a little mental box that says *""I need a higher paying job doing the same sort of thing""*. As you've noticed that's a bit of a needle;haystack task.

* **Option One: University.** Just from your style of writing you are obviously decently intelligent. University is expensive, and there are huge minefields to avoid (*cough psychology cough*). However, degrees - and especially technical or professional degrees let you tap into other areas of the job market. In most industries now, unless you have a specific talent/skill you'll find there is a glass ceiling on how far you can go without a degree. The other good thing about university when you are a young guy is that it can help to pass a few 'awkward' years around 20-24, when employers don't see much value in you, and can struggle to take you seriously as anything more than a boy doing cheap labor. University is costly, but loans cover it - and if you're prepared to work around the course (which you effectively already do from the sound of your hours) you can live comfortably. The loans are daunting but they do pay off. I wouldn't be earning £45k a year without a degree, full stop. There is a reward for sacrifice. 

* **Option Two: Other Industries.** as others have said, you've obviously picked up a lot of transferable skills and have a fairly impressive, if niche, area of experience. Presumably you're now familiar with things like writing professional emails, scanning, general office etiquette, answering telephones at work? If you're not - pretend you are. Again, I think you need to get out of this mental box where you make something out of this dead end apprenticeship. Start going down high streets looking at general office jobs in places like Reed. Most pay about £13k for new starters which is more than you get now by a fair measure. 

* **Option Three: Hard Truths.** Less of an option, more of a suggestion. You are obviously in a competitive jobs market. You already missed out on a job you wanted as another person beat you to it. Now, it's easy and perhaps to some extent true to blame your situation for that one... But ultimately you need to break out of this job or your future is going to be pretty bleak. This is a good time for some painfully honest self reflection. What things are stopping you being more employable? Time to cut that hair back, smarten up, make a more professional looking CV, develop your interview skills a little bit. As much as you want to spoil your girlfriend now is not the time. You need to pump whatever cash your making into making yourself more employable. Go and get a decent suit if you don't have one.

Anyway, I hope this gives you some food for thought. It does get better, being a guy between 20 - 28 (ish) can actually be pretty demoralising. Employers don't always take you seriously especially if you look younger than you are. But it's up to you to break out of it. You need to own your recent failure to get a permanent job and accept sole responsibility. It can be tough love but it's how we grow as individuals.

Since other's have largely covered music, I'll concentrate on food - but for some hidden nightlife gems there are quite a few hidden prohibition-style bars, without spoiling the fun ask around about Red Lights, Milk Thistle or Hyde &amp; Co. (among others), they're fairly dear but it's fun experience, and great with friends visiting town who have no idea why you're picking up a payphone in a seedy hallway with no signage to be let in to a bar.

  
  


There are so many nice places to eat, but some of my favourite:
**Matina's** in St Nick's Market - it's a Iraqi grill which does the most insanely tasty Kurdish Naans, and the lads that run it are super friendly. There's also a great falafel stand 10 seconds away!  


**Cafe Kino** in Stokes Croft is a vegan cafe that's open late and does amazing veggie burgers.  


**The Stable** on the Waterfront do really nice pizza, and have 30 or so ciders to try.  


**Friska** has a couple of locations in Bristol and they do amazing Moroccan meatballs and killer Vietnamese pho noodles.  


**Workhouse Cafe** is at the bottom of St Michael's hill and is my favourite place for lunch and/or coffee, they run a large allotment and make a lot of their food with their own grown ingredients and the make crazy good Guinness and chocolate cake and the best panforte I've ever tried, and they use yummy coffee from Bristol-based roasters. ([Check them out on twitter](https://twitter.com/CafeWorkhouse)).  

Also at the bottom of St Michael's Hill is **The Cyprus Kebab House** which looks like a dingy takeaway, but it has a tardis-like restaurant to the rear which is really cosy and the staff are amazing and they do increible Greek kebabs!  


**East Bristol Bakery** is plain amazing!  


**Full Court Press** and **Small Street** both specialise in high-end coffee, really amazing if you're into your coffee!  


There's a lot of arguing about where to get the best burger in Bristol, but for my money it has to be from **The Chomp Grill** which is a van that sells from different locations around the city depending on which day it is, and sometimes gets involved with various pop-up restaurants around the city. [Website here - but best to follow him on twitter if you want to find out where the van is!](http://www.chompgrill.co.uk/#!the-chomp-truck/c1pwt).  


**The Gallimaufry** does amazing food as often have good DJ's later into the evening - a great place to start before heading for a night spent in **Crofter's Rights** or **The Canteen** (both of which do good food too! especially the pizzas at Crofter's Rights!).  


Oh, and **Taka-taka** on the Triangle does great Greek food!  


And the **Olive Shed** down by the big steam cranes at the harbour does amazing bistro style itallian!


And if you like independant cinema, the **Watershed** cinema has a nice cafe!  


[Edit] - and for lectures, depends what you're into but I'd recommend checking out some of the free public lectures by the Uni - [here](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/pace/public-events/autumn-art-lectures/) or [here](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/pace/public-events/) or check out the [Eventbrite listsings for Bristol](http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/directory?format=Seminar&amp;loc=Bristol&amp;sort=best&amp;slat=51.4545&amp;slng=-2.5879&amp;vp_ne_lat=51.5745&amp;vp_ne_lng=-2.4679&amp;vp_sw_lat=51.3345&amp;vp_sw_lng=-2.7079&amp;crt=regular&amp;).

I kind of agree with his sentiment. Life is hard, we can't escape that but there's no need to make it extra especially hard on some people if we can avoid it. Social equality is about everyone having an equal chance and opportunity at life and at the resources available. Allowing the severely disabled to be born and raised is like saying, ""yes, you are at a significant disadvantage and everything you do in your life is going to be immeasurably harder than your peers BUT your life is sacred and we are going to maintain and prolong it a much as we can, regardless of its quality, condition or projected length.

&gt;I keep mulling a theory over in my head, but it seems as if no one ages normally while in the Tardis, or probably more accurately the Time Vortex, and probably more accurate still... in and out of the TARDIS. Meaning, your aging slows to a crawl, if not near a dead stop, while in the TARDIS, and you only age when out of the TARDIS. Additionally, there is probably a little lag between the time you leave the TARDIS and are back to aging at a normal rate again. It seems when the Doctor has lived for hundreds of years, but changed very little in aged appearance, he has spent a good bit or most of his the time in the TARDIS and not that much relatively out of it.
&gt;
&gt;This would explain his aging during this time with the ""Ponds"" (or when he was away from them for a while before Lake Silencio) vs. how he aged when he was on Trenzalore defending Christmas. Of course he didn't look nearly as aged during the first 300 years on Trenzalore vs. the Master's accelerating 10's age by 100 years, but you could timey-wimey that explanation by saying it was the method by which he was aged (via a laser screwdriver complete with compact Lazarus tech).

&gt;Just a thought.

***Major Spoiler Warning: The OP shouldn't read any further!!***

The Doctor *lets himself out of the Pandorica*. That's how lazy the writing gets. The Weeping Angels degenerate into caricatures of themselves that live in your mind's eye? Really? If the Doctor was a miniaturised version of himself in a robot, why was there a time-paradox if the Doctor wasn't actually killed? Characters that were introduced in previous seasons get completely ignored in favour of Moffat created characters (e.g. what happened to Jenny, the Doctor's daughter?)

Moffat is an excellent writer, but only when he's tempered by another equal-but-opposite talent (like Davies).

EDIT:

&gt;I always find it funny that the criticisms people bring up with Moffat are generally the same for Davies as well

As somebody that's watched the show for decades, I've seen the writing quality go up and down over the years. For example, compare Tom Baker's stories ""Genesis of the Daleks"" with ""The Nymon"". One was a brilliant story and the other made me (even as a child) cringe. The difference was that in the classic series there were lots of writers contributing unconnected stories, while the new series is dominated by a single writer that controls and alters all used scripts in order to form a season arc.

The red and green together on the crest is just a relatively recent adaptation. The two colours first appeared together on the crest of the shirt for the 2002-03 season. Before that, the crest was either all red (see: 2000-02 home shirt), or all green (for the years we had green away kits back in the 90s).

true,MICOTINATE,null,null,"We aren't man united but we've been back in the premier league 3 years and finished 8th but our shirt sponsor is paying us less than 2 of the 3 promoted sides.

Like wise if we're selling shirts at around £60 that's including VAT, then there's cost of manufacturing and shipping. Generous estimation we're making £50 pure profit on each shirt then we would have to sell 120,000 shirts to get 6m. That's 4x the capacity of St. Mary's and when I was there for Leverkusen I saw more shirts from our last season in the championship than any premier league kit.

If our ambitions stretch to Europe and beyond the club needs transfer funds and most importantly to increase the wage bill gradually. Thanks to FFP the wage bill is dependant on our revenue. 

Forgoing kit manufacturing deals to make our own and having small time sponsors puts those ambitions well out of reach. If we had an enormous world wide fan base who bought the new shirt every season maybe the '100% profit from each shirt' argument would hold water. But we don't, and even the clubs that do have that kind of fan base don't make their own. The kit is in house this season out of necessity not because it's good business long term.

true,iamaravind,lfc12,,"Well we were stuck a bit against Southampton till Lambert came on and we switched to the 4-4-2 diamond, so that is an option to partner Balotelli with Sturridge. But he's versatile enough to play on the wings and interchange with Sturridge much like what we saw with Suarez. Balotelli's a bit more selfish mind you, but it could be an interesting thing to watch. Gives him space to cut in from the flanks and curl a scorcher in.

Right now all I'm interested in is seeing this deal closed. Best option that we have left with 2 weeks ago, and would take him over Eto'o anyday.
