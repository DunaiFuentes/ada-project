true,notsoyoungpadawan,null,null,"&gt;You are comparing an engineer to a referee. Engineers have foresight into their project, while a referee has to take decisions in matter of seconds.

You are getting into semantics now. That doesn't matter. An engineer's job is also more risky because people's lives are at stake. So yes, they have momentary foresight, but projects change and there are several variables, from monitoring supervisors to any accidents that may occur on site - which also require immediate decision making.

&gt;If they make 10 good decisions and 1 bad decision every match, would you call that inconsistent?

Where exactly did I say that isn't good enough? 

Also I am not talking about ""good decisions"".. I am talking about ""consistent decisions"". The difference is consistent decisions can include bad decisions.. But going something like, awarding a yellow card for a mis-timed slide tackle (which is fair and correct) and then in the same match awarding only a foul, or not even a foul for the same incident involving another team's player - that is a lack of consistency. Its as though the referee in his mind doesn't know what he considers a foul either. Take Mike Dean vs UTD. Sends off Vidic, doesn't send off Rafael even though it was a clearer foul - why? Because in his head he'd already sent off one player, so why make things worse? That is a LACK of consistency in decisions and something I have a problem with.

Because of this lack of consistency, nobody knows what a good decision is or isn't. And because the players aren't sure, they dive to protect themselves from serious injuries, or decide they deserve a foul so they go down.

I do think there should be some basics though such as the benefits system, NHS, dentistry, uni, JSA.

Index funds are like buying loads of stocks from loads of different companies. This makes them less risky, as they aren't *all* going to go out of business. These are also called ""tracker"" funds, as they usually ""track"" a particular market (say, the biggest 500 companies in the US).

A lot of them don't have a fixed cost for buying or selling, rather they charge some percentage each year. This fee should be as low as possible. 

People talk a lot about ""vanguard"", this is a company which make and manage these index funds. Though there are many others, vanguard have traditionally extremely low fees.

There are various other fees you end up paying, depending on how and in what you invest. Usual rules apply, get the lowest fees for the amount of money you have.

Now, onto that thread. There has been a change in the regulations about how different fees can be charged, which comes into force I think in April. Some people you can get a stocks and shares isa with have already changed what they charge, but Hargreaves and Lansdown have only just announced their charges. The post is about working out who is now the cheapest to invest with.

&gt;The money is available, it just needs ambition and clarity of vision behind it in order to be spent appropriately.

And that's what it comes down to. I don't think the money is available to go and spend £50M on Vidal or £35M on Mata. It seems like we have an annual transfer budget of around £40M right now so unless we're only buying that one player, which might be a valid plan, it's a matter of budget and not strategy.

The chav likes to dress in a tracksuit, although frequently partakes in little or no exercise at all. There is a fairly stereotypical assumption in the media that chavs are an unrescueable bit of society, due to their lack of education and terrible attitude towards work. Many are thought to be under the assumption that being on benefits is better than having a job, because you get more time to do your own thing - many chav couples have babies because they get more money from the state that way. Many chavs are poor at budgeting, which leads to brand new smartphones and games consoles, and too little money to pay rent. The opinions of most of the people I know fall between that most chavs are scroungers and should be made to work in the workhouse, or that most are simply too uneducated to help themselves out of the whole that they've made for themselves.

I've never heard of a ""wooo girl"", so that probably answers that question. 

A ""bro"" (as opposed to one's ""bro"", which here is just a term for a close male friend, usually used jokingly) by its American definition is a man who has traditionally male interests, is sexist, though not necessarily misogynistic, probably homophobic, and often slightly less educated than they like to believe. They are politically conservative. 

A chav is all those things, though not necessarily male, but with the added assumption of lower class. There are chavs with decent incomes, though they're not the norm, but culturally they're still lower class. Chavs also usually want more services from the state, but to pay less tax.  They are politically apathetic. ",0,1390986795,null,0,false,0,cf1p2b0,t3_1wg984,t1_cf1p2b0,t3_1wg984,null,1435513018,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

BR seems to put huge emphasis on how everything is about the team, and not about the individuals.

Letting Sturridge taking it is allowing him to go for personal glory rather than giving the team the best chance of scoring (same for the subsequent chance when it was 3 on 2 and though I expected Sturridge to score, if Coutinho/Sturridge had passed to Suarez instead then it would almost definitely have been a goal).

Stevie May actually sounds quite interesting this [BBC article on him](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25854199) from a few days ago. This quote stands out:

&gt; He was quiet and focused. And his work ethic meant he was the last player to leave the training ground.

However we are talking about the Scottish League. If they were reluctant to take Nahki Wells as there'd be a question mark over him for PL football...you'd imagine the same rule applies here.

In spite of what I said about him in another thread, Zamora looked semi-useful last night. Not 50000 notes a week worth, but nonetheless more effective than I've seen him in a long time. It was against a tragic Bolton team though. Nonetheless as it stands we should be able to cobble together a strike force every game from him, Austin, Johnson and one of the kids.

At this point I'm also not entirely convinced another striker is going to make a lot of difference. I'll gamble an opinion and say that - longer term - a lot more playing time together between Carroll and Kranjcar would be more valuable in creating chances. Ditto some consistency down the left wing - another player at Phillips' level down that side of the pitch would be a godsend.

If they do need someone as injury cover for Austin - and I suppose they do, as Johnson and Zamora are not the most robust/versatile of players - then Stevie May sounds about right. I'd certainly rather go that route than spunk millions into Blackburn's account. If we want Rhodes we can try and get him if/when we know PL revenues/Remy transfer £££s are coming our way.

Bobby got it all wrong. Alcaraz with Jags was a disaster in a high line. It's not that Distin is so amazing that we missed him, we missed his pace big time. Stones with Jags and Hibbert right back should have been the answer as Hibbert is so experienced he would have sorted us out defensively despite their abundance in pace.

We definitely rushed players back and that was a mistake. Pienaar was woeful, Jags didn't look himself and Barkley wasn't as direct as he usually is, although he made a better account of himself than most.

We're never going to get 4th, our squad simply isn't good enough. When you hear 'Lukaku off for Naismith' you know you're fucked.

A striker is urgent. Not because Romelu is injured but because he is so shit in build up play. Before he was injured, any pass up to him he lost. He's absolutely dire technically. No first touch and can't pass them ball. Mirallas is honestly a better option up front because he can bring others in well and is a handy finisher to boot.

Pienaar needs replacing as well. He was definitely injured but he can't handle fast paced games any more. Someone who can drift inside and create would be perfect, essentially we need a younger Pienaar (Holtby).

b) She hasn't been ignoring it, she's been unable to pay.  This is the nature of a debt problem, rather than a reading letters problem.

c) It is something we've been thinking about anyway - so this maybe moves it forward by a couple of months, but hopefully this will be a good thing either way.

d) We spoke to the debt collectors last night.  We haven't spoken to the bank yet.  Step Change advise she gets another bank account set up before we tell the bank.  She has been keeping up theg minimum payment and the loan repayment with the bank.

---

&gt;

&gt;Three national **rankings of universities in the United Kingdom** are published annually – by The Complete University Guide, The Guardian and jointly by The Times and The Sunday Times. Rankings have also been produced in the past by The Daily Telegraph and the Financial Times.

&gt;The primary aim of the rankings is to inform potential undergraduate applicants about UK universities based on a range of criteria, including entry standards, student satisfaction, staff/student ratio, academic services and facilities expenditure per student, research quality, proportion of Firsts and 2:1s, completion rates and student destinations.[](#cite_note-Guardian_Methodology-1)[](#cite_note-2) All of the league tables also rank universities on their strength in individual subjects.

Why would you not be making those exports now?

He had been advised by the store he could return the laptop if he was not satisfied. The store accepted the return and acknowledged it by returning his deposit.

If I get a mobile phone contract I have a 7 day cooling off period. If I return the phone within that period, I will assume the contract and all related liabilities are cancelled. I would be surprised if it was 'cancelled' but I was still liable for the whole or parts of the contract.

That is this man's case - that he cancelled the contract, the cancellation was accepted, but he was still liable for the loan. It was legally a separate agreement but many have astutely pointed out that this wasn't made clear. Considering the competence of the average PC World employee you can see why that might be the case. 

That's what the case resolves around, with PC World feeling they don't have the responsibility to make it clear, but consumer advocates feeling if someone cancels a contract it has to be obvious if they still have outstanding obligations to third parties.

Furthermore, one must consider the impact being able to allocate investment as Scotland sees fit. This could lead to an increase in industry, and from that, and increase in exports.

A lot of the economy and Scotland's funding is decided by Westminster, who set it according to what's best for London's financial markets, rather than industry, or indeed Scotland. With independence, it is argued, the increased control over taxation and investment could lead to a more benefitial climate for industry producing tradable goods, for instance coal mines could be reopened (Scotland has 75% of the UK's coal), green energy could be further invested in, infrastructure in Scotland could have more investment etc. etc.

In terms of the kneejerk reaction, you can probably see what I meant about that too, one loss and its doom and gloom and if we dont sign a CDM we wont get fourth because Gerrard is toilet there, then he has a good game against Everton and he is the best CDM in the world, running through brick walls etc. 

Either way, genuinely, thank you for actually trying to provide a point of view and generate discussion instead of just attacking mine, that's what I particularly like about this sub. 

4-0, should have been more, we have now taken 4 points out of the Everton games, to their one, 3 points from spurs and 3 points from Manchester united (so far), I think these will be the games we need to win, and with Arsenals very difficult February, and European games for Man City, Chelsea and Manchester united, and Spurs playing Thursday/Sunday, with potentially very long trips thrown in there,  I think we may well be right in the tip four mix come the middle of march, providing we play as well as we can, even with the injuries. I think we may well have had our blip already this season, and with players coming back from injury over the next 2-3 weeks, things will be looking up towards the end of the season.

Dangerous Driving does not *necessarily* have to have intent. The rules for proving dangerous driving are:

* the way he/she drives falls far below what would be expected of a competent and careful driver, and * it would be obvious to a competent and careful driver that driving in that way would be dangerous; or if it would be obvious to a competent and careful driver that driving the vehicle in its current state (for the purpose of the determination of which regard may be had to anything attached to or carried on or in it, and to the manner in which it is attached or carried) would be dangerous.

There is no intent needed, just a lack of competency when operating a vehicle.

true,pandanomic,null,null,"Spurs lurker here, here's my take (since it looks like a lot of people in this thread haven't really seen much of our play recently)

We're on fire right now, and just got Vertonghen, Paulinho, and Sandro back from injury. Adebayor's got a fire in his belly that I haven't seen since he was on loan from you, Dembele is playing better than I have seen in awhile, and Eriksen has been lighting up our attack.

I couldn't possibly guess who'll win this, but I think it's going to be a fantastic match.

Biggest concern for us is Dawson. He's a great captain, but has a massive weakness against nimble, shorter strikers like Aguero and Suarez. 

Another concern is Sherwood's preference of Bentaleb (19 year old kid from the academy) over a DM like Capoue. He's very promising and it's fine against mid table teams, but against United Capoue was exactly what we needed in the midfield to control that game. Sherwood and Ferdinand seem to be of the opinion that DM's aren't necessary though, but many of us fans disagree. Bentaleb was overrun against Arsenal in the FA cup (in a match that was otherwise honestly very close. Their second goal was more of a howler from Rose than their doing). I could see it going better though if he makes Dembele sit deeper.

City will need to figure out how to stop Eriksen's production, something that Toure and Fernandinho are well equipped to do. Eriksen has been our top signing I think so far, even in a 'bad' game against Newcastle he had something like 11 key passes, which is unreal. Since his return from injury, he's clearly adapted to the physicality of the league, playing good defense and also having several successful take ons against defenders.

I'm personally hoping Paulinho gets the start over Bentaleb, that will make the midfield battle very entertaining. The game he was injured in against Stoke, he was having a MOTM performance, with some incredible flair that one could only assume was developed playing beach football in Brazil.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"It's tricky, axing legal aid and creating this no-win-no-fee culture that funds day time tv advertising was at the time, something I thought quite terrible.

I'd always been taught that legal aid would be there if you were seriously wronged.  But in all honesty I don't think it would have reached many people in society (some who wouldn't realise it was there at all), I know that some people considered it to be rather nepotistic as to what would get funded and what wouldn't.

A good example for this is the infamous US McD coffee lawsuit.  It is open spun as ""they started putting warning, coffee may be hot on the cup"" but that isn't the end of the story.  The lady in question suffered horrific burns requiring a lot of hospital fees.  It turned out that to avoid refills, McD had been cranking the temperature as much as possible, so you couldn't drink it fast.  They had also ignored concerns raised about the safety of this.

What I am trying to get at, is one mans frivolous lawsuit, may well actually bely a serious issue.

When you say insurance and social funds, it is normally insurance that is being sued.  They *learn the lesson* by preventing those who take out the insurance to operate without extra safe guards, or operate at all.

The problem comes that as a society we often place too much emphasis on one case, one life is so precious to us, that we will right off many other opportunities to preserve it.

So on this case, let's have a tiny thought exercise.  Someone knows that this perishable food has been contaminated, they put it to the bin.  Someone finds it in the bin, it's even in date.  They eat it, they fall ill.  Ok you say, so the store should delineate between the dangerous food waste, and the non-dangerous.  Well the problem is there that they are effectively saying anything that is ""non-dangerous"" is safe.

When you consider that supermarkets pay quite a bit for waste disposal, it is normally more in their interest to sell the item for 10p if it is deemed safe still.  Everything in the bin is normally deemed unsafe.  A few years back a student friend dumpster dove a bag of chocolate bars, the reason they had been discarded he figured was due to the outer packaging being damaged.  Myself as I wasn't starving didn't fancy having a chocolate bar that had the potential to be exposed to something.

The second study mentions that controlling for other sources interracial economic disparity is a major predictor of crime. 

&gt;The results showed that controlling for racial
segregation, city disadvantage, and a variety of other
factors, interracial economic inequality had a strong
positive effect on the overall violent crime rate, and
more specifically, on the Black-on-Black crime rate.
Additionally, racial segregation predicted White-on-
Black crime.

Essentially it's social factors that are more prevalent in black communities, often because of racism and segregation, as well as poverty that cause the difference in crime rate. 

A [2009 study](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110314171826/http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs09/horr19c.pdf) by the home office mentions that after controlling for other factors ethnicity does not influence crime. 

&gt;The analysis does not indicate any significant influence on trajectories associated with ethnicity or religious affiliation,
after controlling for other factors included in the models. 

It mentioned that gender, drug use, peer groups, having a single-parent and the quality of schooling were all major factors in crime. ",0,1390992704,null,0,false,0,cf1py6f,t3_1wegno,t1_cf1py6f,t1_cf1ptjq,null,1432157435,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Thus they are most often found at parties and other large social events and are not easily identifiable as individuals (as they return to more 'normal' behaviour when on their own). It's also worth noting that these groups can exist in any social environment and at all levels of personal finance.

Spurs alert Twente to attempts to sell them a player involving a rogue mandate and a forged siganture
Tottenham have uncovered a pre-deadline day transfer scam surrounding FC Twente striker Luc Castaignos

Tottenham Hotspur have helped uncover an incredible pre-deadline day transfer scam surrounding FC Twente striker Luc Castaignos that has been reported to Fifa, the world governing body.

Castaignos, a highly-rated Holland Under-21 international, was offered to Tottenham by a rogue group, who allegedly forged a mandate document for a potential sale of the player.

A Croatian negotiator contacted Tottenham directly, claiming to have the rights to arrange a transfer for Castaignos to England, but the proposed deal quickly unravelled.

Tottenham already know one of the agents who is affiliated with Castaignos, Rodger Linse, because he had worked on the deal to take midfielder Mousa Dembele to White Hart Lane in 2012.

There is also a good working relationship between Tottenham and FC Twente after the two clubs negotiated the transfer of Nacer Chadli over last summer.

Spurs contacted Twente to query the claims of the Croatian negotiator and left the matter in the hands of the Dutch club, who deny anyone was mandated to conduct a transfer.

It has since transpired the alleged false mandate document included a forged signature of Twente chairman Joop Munsterman.
A Twente spokesman said: “The club were informed about the situation by a contact in England. It is correct that the signature of the club chairman was forged and the matter is now in the hands of the Dutch federation and Fifa.”

Tottenham officials confirmed raising the issue with Twente, but were unaware of the scale of the attempted scam.

Twente approached the Dutch football employers’ organisation, FBO, to investigate the case and they have now referred it to the Dutch federation and Fifa after alerting clubs of the fake mandate.

They have also sent a letter to three agents, Domagoj Lisica, Karim el Atmani and Danny Budimir, threatening police action.
Budimir, who is based in the United States, immediately contacted FBO to explain his involvement.

He said: “I was approached with this mandate to try to help find a club for Luc Castaignos in the MLS.

""I have seen false mandates before, but never a fake mandate from the club. I’m happy to assist the Dutch federation and Fifa with any investigations.”

The other agents have not responded.

Serge Rossmeisl, CEO of FBO, is aware Tottenham were one of the clubs targeted. He said: “We have never seen a false mandate before. The first priority was to ensure it would not be used again and now we have left the matter with the Dutch federation and Fifa.”
Spurs believe they were contacted by the scammers because of reports the club still have plenty of money to spend from the sale of Gareth Bale to Real Madrid and want a new striker.

Chairman Daniel Levy is traditionally active in the final days of the transfer window and could be tempted into a deal to re-sign former forward Dimitar Berbatov until the end of the season.

Berbatov has only six months left on his Fulham deal and the London club are keen to try to sign Olympiakos striker Konstantinos Mitroglou, who could be a replacement.

Head coach Tim Sherwood has insisted he is happy with his squad, but admitted Spurs may be attracted to the right piece of business.
Midfielders Etienne Capoue, who is a target of Napoli, and Lewis Holtby, who is interesting Borussia Dortmund, Schalke, Fulham and Stoke, could both leave White Hart Lane before the transfer window shuts.

Tottenham entertain free-scoring Manchester City on Wednesday night and Sherwood has promised his team will not simply try to stifle the visitors, despite losing 6-0 at Eastlands in November.

Sherwood sees similarities between this season’s City team and the Blackburn side with whom he won the Premier League title in 1995 and believes Alvaro Negredo can be as influential as Alan Shearer, who scored 34 goals that season.

“If he can be anything like Alan in the Premier League, then he won’t do too badly,” said Sherwood. “They both score every type of goal, they hold the ball up well. He is probably the most similar to Shearer as there has been in recent years.

“Teams were scared of the Blackburn side I played in, they got everyone behind the ball and they were just waiting to get beaten.

""You can see it is the same with Manchester City. I have never been a believer in that. You can have a lot of people behind the ball and get hammered. You need to have your own attacking threats.

“Pellegrini has made a mockery of the ‘boring English 4-4-2’. People keep saying it’s old hat, but they’re running away with the league playing that, just as United did for many years.

""We never changed our system at Blackburn to accommodate anyone and Pellegrini isn’t doing that either.”

Meanwhile, Tottenham defender Vlad Chiriches was accused of being drunk in his native Romania after video footage emerged of him having to be helped to walk by friends before falling over.

“He had a weekend off and now he has got to play well,” said Sherwood. “We won’t fine him. He wasn’t breaking any rules. For his own sake, you wish it didn’t happen. He was unsteady on his legs. It’s windy over there.”",0,1390993663,null,0,false,0,cf1q309,t3_1wf807,t1_cf1q309,t1_cf1mdyi,null,1432157492,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

true,fast_lloris,null,null,"Tottenham Hotspur have helped uncover an incredible pre-deadline day transfer scam surrounding FC Twente striker Luc Castaignos that has been reported to Fifa, the world governing body.

Castaignos, a highly-rated Holland Under-21 international, was offered to Tottenham by a rogue group, who allegedly forged a mandate document for a potential sale of the player.

A Croatian negotiator contacted Tottenham directly, claiming to have the rights to arrange a transfer for Castaignos to England, but the proposed deal quickly unravelled.

Tottenham already know one of the agents who is affiliated with Castaignos, Rodger Linse, because he had worked on the deal to take midfielder Mousa Dembele to White Hart Lane in 2012.

There is also a good working relationship between Tottenham and FC Twente after the two clubs negotiated the transfer of Nacer Chadli over last summer.

Spurs contacted Twente to query the claims of the Croatian negotiator and left the matter in the hands of the Dutch club, who deny anyone was mandated to conduct a transfer.

It has since transpired the alleged false mandate document included a forged signature of Twente chairman Joop Munsterman.

A Twente spokesman said: “The club were informed about the situation by a contact in England. It is correct that the signature of the club chairman was forged and the matter is now in the hands of the Dutch federation and Fifa.”

Tottenham officials confirmed raising the issue with Twente, but were unaware of the scale of the attempted scam.

Twente approached the Dutch football employers’ organisation, FBO, to investigate the case and they have now referred it to the Dutch federation and Fifa after alerting clubs of the fake mandate.
They have also sent a letter to three agents, Domagoj Lisica, Karim el Atmani and Danny Budimir, threatening police action.
Budimir, who is based in the United States, immediately contacted FBO to explain his involvement.


He said: “I was approached with this mandate to try to help find a club for Luc Castaignos in the MLS.
""I have seen false mandates before, but never a fake mandate from the club. I’m happy to assist the Dutch federation and Fifa with any investigations.”


The other agents have not responded.


Serge Rossmeisl, CEO of FBO, is aware Tottenham were one of the clubs targeted. He said: “We have never seen a false mandate before. The first priority was to ensure it would not be used again and now we have left the matter with the Dutch federation and Fifa.”

Spurs believe they were contacted by the scammers because of reports the club still have plenty of money to spend from the sale of Gareth Bale to Real Madrid and want a new striker.

Chairman Daniel Levy is traditionally active in the final days of the transfer window and could be tempted into a deal to re-sign former forward Dimitar Berbatov until the end of the season.

Berbatov has only six months left on his Fulham deal and the London club are keen to try to sign Olympiakos striker Konstantinos Mitroglou, who could be a replacement.

Head coach Tim Sherwood has insisted he is happy with his squad, but admitted Spurs may be attracted to the right piece of business.
Midfielders Etienne Capoue, who is a target of Napoli, and Lewis Holtby, who is interesting Borussia Dortmund, Schalke, Fulham and Stoke, could both leave White Hart Lane before the transfer window shuts.

Tottenham entertain free-scoring Manchester City on Wednesday night and Sherwood has promised his team will not simply try to stifle the visitors, despite losing 6-0 at Eastlands in November.

Sherwood sees similarities between this season’s City team and the Blackburn side with whom he won the Premier League title in 1995 and believes Alvaro Negredo can be as influential as Alan Shearer, who scored 34 goals that season.

“If he can be anything like Alan in the Premier League, then he won’t do too badly,” said Sherwood. “They both score every type of goal, they hold the ball up well. He is probably the most similar to Shearer as there has been in recent years.

“Teams were scared of the Blackburn side I played in, they got everyone behind the ball and they were just waiting to get beaten.
""You can see it is the same with Manchester City. I have never been a believer in that. You can have a lot of people behind the ball and get hammered. You need to have your own attacking threats.

“Pellegrini has made a mockery of the ‘boring English 4-4-2’. People keep saying it’s old hat, but they’re running away with the league playing that, just as United did for many years.

""We never changed our system at Blackburn to accommodate anyone and Pellegrini isn’t doing that either.”

Meanwhile, Tottenham defender Vlad Chiriches was accused of being drunk in his native Romania after video footage emerged of him having to be helped to walk by friends before falling over.

“He had a weekend off and now he has got to play well,” said Sherwood. “We won’t fine him. He wasn’t breaking any rules. For his own sake, you wish it didn’t happen. He was unsteady on his legs. It’s windy over there.”

That's a matter for the supermarket, not the police. Trespass is not a criminal offense.

The people who shop during regular hours are generally not the same people who resort to skipping to obtain their food. There's a compromise to be made by relying on waste food - you don't get to choose what you want, and you have to put up with food that is past its peak freshness. 

The fact is that supermarkets have created a business model that wastes a large volume of perfectly edible food. The kind of things you generally find in a supermarket bin are high volume short shelf life items that have high mark-ups, such as bread (especially from in-store bakeries), cakes, factory processed meat and dairy products, ready meals, and bagged pre-sliced vegetables. 

The only reason why you can find so much food in supermarket bins is because there are plenty of people who are willing to pay for quality and convenience.

They obviously sell these items in high enough quantities to make the amount wasted profitable.

What the hell are you talking about.  I'm referring to a very successful scheme in the Netherlands, and you equate it to rape and feminism.

It is part of their policy, separate cyclists and mopeds from cars in areas where people have high speeds, in residential areas, remind cars not to drive in an aggressive manner.  A street I frequently use in London would greatly benefit from signs like this.  Thanks to cars parking, it is only wide enough for one car.  I will do about 18-23mph according to my gps.  Yet a lot of cars over take me aggressively, breaking the speed limit and without a car width to do so.  I am not complaining about that, I complain because obviously thanks to all the parked cars, they will have to stop, yield so another car can pass in the opposite direction.  Which they frequently do blocking me.  My point is changing the priorities on that street wouldn't slow down motorists, but would create a much safer environment.

I'm not some cycle nut, I enjoy rally driving and have probably taken it a bit too far on more than one occasion (best car I've ever driven is every one I didn't own!), hell I'm a recreational pilot, so I love speed and machines.

I think that Gerrard will play there week in week out even when Lucas returns. 

For me, Villa was a tactical mistake by BR. We played 4-2-3-1 whilst last night it looked much more like a 4-3-3 with Coutinho practically playing as a CM alongside Henderson. 

I honestly believe the days of us playing a tough tackling DM are gone. BR wants us to play this high pressure game, with two hard working, almost box to box, midfielders with a deep lying playmaker in behind them. For me, there is no better two midfielders in our squad than Allen and Henderson to play these roles. 

Essentially, Gerrard has all the protection of two CMs who know how to press, how to win the ball back, and how to start an attack. Meaning his defensive qualities aren't of upmost importance, his distribution and his ability to read the game will be - something which are Gerrard's best qualities.

It might be an insane opinion, but I don't see much room for Lucas in this lineup. BR already tried to play him further up the field a few weeks ago, something which didnt really work out and without the need for a tough tacking DM, I genuinely think he'll be benched.

No, I fail to understand how a sign telling me that I am a guest on a road I paid for reminds me of the rules of the road.

Why does the sign say *cars* are guests? Why not all vehicles? We all pay for the roads and all have every right to be there. Why are cars the guests?

&gt;For shits and gigles a mate and I made a little ultrasound distance measuring logger, strapped it to my bag, and measured the average distance people left between over taking me in London. I trust everyone here who has a license knows what the highway code states as a must on this matter. Less than 10% of overtakes detected by this where legal.

You're either lying or are not familiar with the highway code. It insists upon no specific minimum distance whatsoever.

&gt;There are a significant number of drivers who have no respect for cyclists, in areas where it isn't economically viable to provide safer infrastructure, things that help change the mind of these poor drivers is a good thing surely?

There are also a significant number of drivers who have no respect for the highway code.

A sign specifically aimed at motorists when all road users should be keeping the rules of the road in mind, is ridiculous.

You paid for?  What's that got anything to do with it.  By that logic we should all be yielding to Simon Cowel.

It is about reminding cars they are to yield.  Cars are frequently capable of speed far in-excess of that of most other road users.  My understanding of their ethos is that it's about ensuring that the users with the most energy yield.  The fact is that cars have resulted in the death of far more pedestrians and cyclists, than pedestrians and cyclists have killed car drivers.

&gt;You're either lying or are not familiar with the highway code. It insists upon no specific minimum distance whatsoever.

163 says helpfully, As much room as when overtaking a car.  But the ThinkCyclist bit specifies half a car width.  These old pair I had where only accurate to below 30CM.  I don't think anyone could justify that as a legal overtake?  Obviously the calibration has dodgy, and a host of other things.  It was just an interesting insight.

&gt;There are also a significant number of drivers who have no respect for the highway code.
A sign specifically aimed at motorists when all road users should be keeping the rules of the road in mind, is ridiculous.

The reason is simple.  How many drivers have been killed or injured by a pedestrian or a cyclist? ",0,1390996263,null,0,false,0,cf1qgxn,t3_1wewvq,t1_cf1qgxn,t1_cf1qb9r,null,1432157654,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Well, someone has to start :) And if anybody is going to compel MS to make it such that MS Office writes files in the standard they forced through ISO it's a Government. Though probably not ours.

&gt; which will be a problem that never goes away while almost the entire private sector sticks to MS Office (and let's not discuss the cross-training onto another app - another neverending cost),

If only there were a body that could mandate not teaching children how to use single, specific examples of software... :)

&gt; this seems to be more a case of the government trying to get a licensing discount from MS than any real intention to deploy something that will ultimately cost everyone more in the long run.

The cynic in me agrees with that, though I like the thought that they're citing MS Office because that's what they expect their audience to understand. Most savings will be made in infrastructure and consultancy that doesn't really affect which applications are being deployed. Things like replacing a series of discrete IBM+Oracle clusters with commodity hardware and probably virt.  The big change here is the procurement methods, not what's actually being bought.

true,CrashingAnalyst,eng-gloucestershire,Cheltenham,"I think the nuance you may have missed is that on your jobseeker agreement you might say you will apply for 10 jobs each week. So you apply for 10 jobs that you feel you are suited to. I was having interviews with chartered accountants around the country and getting to the final stage. It was just a matter of time and persistance before I landed a permanent role.

Your job centre advisor will *actively dissuade* you from doing this, as they prefer to churn you through the jobs on *their local system*. They will tell you to apply for jobs for which there are no more application forms because they're all gone (Argos), or jobs for which you are not qualified to do (security) because thats what the computer says they have to offload onto people that week. I literally just submitted applications on the job centre plus website and that filled my weekly quota in a quarter of the time it took me to do a 'real' job application. I never got a call back for any of those jobs, but I kept my advisor happy.

After three months signed on one of my real job applications panned out and I moved 200 miles and have been here and happy ever since. The job centre did not help an iota. I was looking for casual work as well to be clear not just graduate jobs - but I couldn't even get a job at McDonalds. Literally the only people half interested in me were the graduate recruiters.

As someone else has said, you need to stop thinking their 'apply for 10 jobs a week' means 'apply for 10 jobs a week'.

On a few occasions, particularly in the first half, Walker was caught too far forward when he should have dropped level with his defensive line. He has to read the danger earlier, otherwise he’ll give more free-kicks away in dangerous positions like in the second half.'

You know a couple of years back, I was nocked off, I was wearing a couple of hundred quids worth of clothing specifically designed high vis stuff, two rear lights.

This is the problem.  A bad cyclist might create a respray bill or something.  No harm to the driver will happen.

A bad driver can result in serious injury and death.  They do, hundreads a year.  The dutch system works well.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;Because all versions of MS office can read files for all the other versions

For the most part, yes. A simple 30Mb, free add-on from MS will make older version read the new format, certainly with more success than...well, any other office suite - most sites rolled that out years ago in order to be able to read email attachments that have come from the newer versions.

&gt;and people never need to be trained on new versions? 

Generally, no they don't. The biggest recent change I can think of was the introduction of the ribbon, but I've yet to visit a site where someone couldn't handle it. Remember, when you're dealing with software that almost everyone runs at home it's much easier to expect this.

&gt;I'm sure there will be some pain involved, but sticking with MS isn't pain free.

That depends on how much integration with non-MS systems you've had to do - suddenly the pain of sticking with all-MS becomes a nostalgic glow. One example - format your SAN to use ext3 (because someone asserts that it's a better filesystem), then discover that you can't use DFS or search tools because they expect to see NTFS. There are *loads* of examples like this.

&gt;Yes, it would be nice if everyone else switched first, but someone has to start

And that someone would be the public. The goverment has never 'driven' IT take-up - not sure why that would happen here. It's not like the whole of Germany decided to go open-source just because Munich wanted to pretend that their savings on MS licenses wasn't going to cost them in the long run.

&gt;and the government is the only orgainisation big enough to make it work.

In a time when it's vital to keep costs down for local authorities, I don't see how that works. No company is going to save money changing to an office suite that almost nobody else uses, that's why there hasn't been a rush of councils (and certainly not private businesses) following Munich's example.",1,1391001059,null,0,1391002862,0,cf1rc7x,t3_1wghfs,t1_cf1rc7x,t1_cf1r45u,null,1432158093,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

And Snowden is an attention seeking coward who has traded military secrets with Russia and China (bastions of human rights and democratic morality) in order to keep out of prison. He says there is no chance that they acquired any of the NSA documents, but you really think Putin would have allowed him to stay without Russian agents having access? Do you reckon Putin would have let him leave if he didn't? Putin could have easily had him disappeared and gotten away with it as the entire world would have blamed the American government, then forced Snowden to give up any files through methods which adhere to Russia's appreciation of human rights, then killed him, left his body somewhere obvious and enjoyed a worldwide PR scandal against America for the next couple of years.  

If he had any balls at all, he would return to America and stand trial.

true,wanson,lfc68,,"Of those three - Moses is the only player you would call a traditional winger  - and he's more of a wide forward than a winger. Aspas and Alberto are central players that have played out wide. Neither has the pace or dribbling ability to succeed in the role. Add to that, Moses has been largely ineffectual when he has played and will likely not be signed permanently leaving us with just one winger in the senior squad - Sterling. Ibe is also on the periphery but is not quite ready yet, massive potential though.

So I can understand us going after Konoplyanka - he's a quick, skilful winger that is not afraid to get stuck in and help out defensively. A massive upgrade on Moses. 

Like most of us on here, I'd also like to see a defensive midfielder signed. But if the right player is not available for the right price, FSG are right to not overspend. Gerrard has proved he can play there (in the right system), and we have Allen and Lucas to come back from injury.

We're 3 points clear in 4th place at the moment and out of the other teams in the top 7 we have arguably the easiest run in with most of our big games to be played at Anfield. We can push on now with the players that got us here and claim (at least) 4th place in the league. 

In the summer, with CL qualification in the bag, we will have more options on players of the right quality.

The row centres on a controversial decision by the Second World War code-breaking complex to stop its tour guides from visiting the neighbouring National Museum of Computing (NMOC).

Now against Everton, Gerrard was deep with Henderson and Coutinho ahead of him. Coutinho was the key to why it worked, he is not only brilliant under pressure, able to pass quickly and precisely but he is also a god at turning players in tight spaces.

With Coutinho in that role, we were able to pass well in midfield without being overran but he was able to turn out and start attacks too. I don't think it was a coincidence that it was Coutinho's best performance of the season, the role seems to suit him down to the ground. That flick over Barry's head was incredible.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt; So what distance are you using as the minimum? And where were you measuring from? The car's doors?

First thing that would give a bounce.  We're talking about £2 worth of components here.  The project started because someone was saying he finds people go closer to him when he wears high vis than when he doesn't, I thought it would be easy to test, and I don't get cause to use my rusty microelectronic skills, so figured it would be interesting.  Thanks to the large amount of 20 zones around me and my friend it was rather easy.

&gt; See, this is what I have a problem with. How are motorists guests on public roads that we all pay for? If motorists are guests, then why isn't everyone else?

That is the point, everyone should be.  Now whilst there are many cyclists who make me cringe, who I hate to share a small cycle lane with, I've never been injured by one.  (My scores so far, hospitalisation thanks to pedestrian who ran out in front of me, 3 scrapes and bruises due to cars, one minor damage to car due to me being distracted, yes I paid for all the damage, I also got an xmas card from him lol).

However, when a cyclist feels they are the priority vehicle no one dies.  Except maybe the cyclist.  When car drivers are like that people die.  Hell that video that went viral last week of the Audi going beyound the ASL into the cycle escape box, because he didn't like the cycles going in front.  There are people like that on the road, they clearly feel cyclists shouldn't be there.

So by making autos guests, other road users feel safer.  But what does that really mean for the motorist?  What does that mean they now can't do? ",0,1391002766,null,0,false,0,cf1rqdf,t3_1wewvq,t1_cf1rqdf,t1_cf1rcqy,null,1432158354,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;To think that they spent 10 years to complete this migration in order to achieve independence and freedom!  And not justify the conversion through cost savings, is surely a cop-out.  I have to wonder what the opportunity costs of this migration were?  All the time and energy spent to swap out Microsoft technology for Open Source yields no functional improvements in their IT portfolio.  At the end of a 10 year effort all they have to show for their investment of time and money is doing the same old word processing and spread sheets on a new OS platform.  If only they took all that money and effort and invested it in delivering new functionality to both the government sector as well as the citizens of Munich - think of the benefits could have been delivered.

&gt;This is like ripping all of the plumbing and electrical wires out of your house to replace them with new components (not sure why you would do this, but it's the best analogy I can come up with).  You notice no difference when you flip on the light switch or turn the water on at the sink, but somehow you feel better having done it.

&gt;I'm no fan of Microsoft, and their pricing structures are crazy, complex and expensive.  And they certainly did take advantage of their market power to extract maximum payments from their customers - but such is capitalism.  Is it Munich's dislike for profit and capitalism that drove them in this direction?  Or was it Munich's dislike of American's profiting from selling their software to the Munich government?  If Microsoft was SAP I bet they never would have under taken this adventure.

You'll be paying higher interest rates on the debt than the rest of the UK

 From the FT;

*Moody’s sovereign bond rating methodology explicitly states that countries would be marked down if they did not have a long record. “Immature economic and political institutions increase the risk of unpredictable behaviour in times of stress, inviting negative credit implications,” its methodology states.*

*It adds that countries more vulnerable to “sudden changes to the economy” could expect lower ratings, a concern that would apply to Scotland, given that 12 per cent of the notional revenues an independent Scotland could hope to collect would come from volatile North Sea receipts.
With such difficulties and a lack of monetary and debt financing flexibility, a senior sovereign bond analyst at a leading rating agency said that a sensible guess for Scotland was that “the rating would be investment grade but [would] fall short of [The UK's]”*

*Launching a report highlighting the vulnerability of an independent Scotland last week, Jonathan Portes, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said the financial strength of an independent Scotland was “not Greece, but not Norway either”. The NIESR report highlighted research that showed Scotland was likely to run a substantial trade deficit. “Countries with external deficits and without central bank powers pay a premium on their government debt,” the report said.*

&gt;We understood that UK law **did not require cyclists to wear helmets or cycle at least 0.5 metres from the kerb**. However, under the Highway Code it was recommended as good practice for cyclists to wear helmets. Therefore, we considered that the scene featuring the cyclist on a road without wearing a helmet undermined the recommendations set out in the Highway Code.

So the ASA appears to be attempting to follow the recommendation of the highway code to wear helmets. OP's article doesn't really address this. (Not whether wearing a helmet is or is not a bad thing but whether it is in the highway code).

The mistake the ASA has made here is mentioning the distance from curb at all.

Remember, when you're dealing with software that almost everyone runs at home it's much easier to expect this.

I was doing Windowsy desktop support when that happened, and that was when we dropped MS Office for OSX and switched our mac users to OOo. The problems were more caused by users who couldn't deal with different than the differences themselves.

Honestly, much as I do take seriously the point that free software has training and support costs that are not necessarily orders of magnitude away from the license fees of proprietary software, I don't think the Offices is as disruptive as people say. But I've only ever been involved in one migration.

&gt; That depends on how much integration with non-MS systems you've had to do - suddenly the pain of sticking with all-MS becomes a nostalgic glow. One example - format your SAN to use ext3 (because someone asserts that it's a better filesystem), then discover that you can't use DFS or search tools because they expect to see NTFS. There are loads of examples like this.

Yeah, MS is absolutely brilliant when you're all-MS. It all fits together seamlessly and wonderfully. But that does limit you rather, and it certainly seems to be getting less and less acceptible to demand only-Microsoft products.

But I work for an all-free-software hosting company, so I definitely get a slightly skewed view.

&gt; No company is going to save money changing to an office suite that almost nobody else uses, that's why there hasn't been a rush of councils (and certainly not private businesses) following Munich's example.

Yeah, this is the point that I remember being far too much of a zealot to notice; were it such a stupid idea to buy MSOffice fewer companies would. As it happens, we'll probably end up largely standardising on doing all this in a web browser in the not too distant future...

1. You are forcing facts to fit together and you can't do that. The best theories go together naturally and make sense. This one does not fit together that well. The 2005 series Master has a brass pocket watch, so does Rory. Just because both have a brass pocket watch does not mean it's the only pocket watch in existence. 

2. We've seen Rory as a baby in the Broken Man companion comic. Please remember that everything Doctor Who related counts as the official story. 

3. The Simpsons have a hallway closet that is also the access to the basement level. It also has an attic that's way bigger than the modest ranch house exterior betrays. Don't forget the two living rooms that are decorated differently and all of the extra walls that appear only when the plot needs it to. Not only that, it's within an afternoon's drive to just about everywhere in America. All of those facts about the Simpsons house combined with what we know about the Tardis does not make Springfield the Doctor's American getaway haven. Homer having a pocket watch does not make him an exiled Time Lord and the fact that you see Tom Baker in the background of certain episode does not mean the Doctor needs to keep tabs on Homer.

The issue though (for me atleast)  always comes down or one to two arguments....

Does wearing a cycle helmet decrease cycling numbers - and does this have a negative impact? The consensus seems to be yes.

And what are helmets for? If its protecting yourself from yourself then pedestrians and drivers should also be wearing them. If its to protect yourself from others, why are we not doing more to stop others from harming you.

Past that I don't put much stock into the other arguments, which if im honest seem pretty weak.

Possibly but if you are fleeing to Russia, you would keep a significant amount for bargaining power. I certainly would. 

&gt; He give interviews, writes letters, might even testify to a European parliament committee. The US certainly won't let him use his trial as a platform and he certainly won't be able to continue his activism in whatever federal supermax he gets thrown into.

And yet his cause fails to significantly resonate with the public at large. His trial would intensify the media debate and force real focus on the issue. I would imagine there would be a queue of hr lawyers ready to take up his case, the court trial would go on for months. He may not be able to use it as a platform, but his supporters certainly could. 

&gt; Hostile acts towards the US intelligence apperatus are what Russia does (and vice versa).
It was a popular move in Russia and he doesn't care how popular it is in the US.
It gives him a powerful bargaining chip.

Those are all reasons to let him stay, but they are not reasons to not acquire any and all the data that was with him at the time. Putin could still pretty much dictate any terms of staying as Snowden couldn't exactly leave - who was he going to ask for help?

&gt; And make it look like the US can do what it likes on Russian soil? Appear weak like Pakistan after the Bin Laden raid? Protecting Snowden is a matter of Russian national pride and sovereignty.

This is a good point. Putin has built his image around being a strong man but you must admit he is very practiced at absorbing attacks or events which could make his government look weak. The countless amounts of terrorist attacks from the Chechen rebels and the Caucasus including the recent Volograd bombing are always followed with ad hoc political flexing that really appeals to the Russian public. Putin seems to always use such events rather than put much effort in to avoiding them. It is plausible that the same thing could occur in this case.

true,BenPistlewizard,eccleston,Eccleston,"I don't think it's fair to dismiss the problems people have with Martha and with Clara down to an over attachment to previous companions. There are serious issues with both of these characters that for many people make them difficult to connect with.

 Firstly Martha; the most widespread complaint about her character is she's annoying. Why? Because her character has essentially a single element to it; which is pining after the Doctor. They could have developed her work as a Doctor, her relationship with her family, or simply made her relationship with the Doctor more complex. But time after time whenever her character is given space and a voice, its to look like a kicked puppy at the Doctor. And its really dull. Her defining characteristic becomes her hurt devotion; and so she often loses much respect from viewers. 

 But if the problem with Martha is that her promising character is stripped down to a single emotional attachment, the problem with Clara is that she doesn't have a character at all. Until 'The Time of the Doctor', where things were vastly improved, we hadn't as an audience been given a single reason to care about Clara. Not one. 

 Her entire first season uses her character as a plot device, she's this 'big mystery'. We're encouraged as an audience to continually guess who she might be and why she might keep appearing. But the consequence of this is that none of the writers want to give us any information about her at all. Or any real moments of character revelation or depth. She's just there. The Doctor may as well lug around a juke box that delivers witty/sassy/cheeky lines at the press of a button.
 
 There's a moment in The Cold War which encapsulates this problem. There's a character called Professor Grisenko. He's the old guy bumbling around listening to Status Quo or Ultravox (I forget) on the Submarine. In the first 20 minutes of that episode we're given plenty of reasons as an audience to warm to him;

-an eccentric/unexpected taste in music
-an informal/innulluisioned figure within the atmosphere of conflict
-he gives warm fatherly advice

 At one point he asks Clara what she likes to do for fun. She says ""You know, stuff"". At times it feels like the writers are going out of their way to make this character bland. The closest the show came to giving us real insight into what Clara was like was The Rings of Akheten, which amounted to a bit of back story about her parents. Thats it.

 I was fond of Amy and Rory, but I was fond of them because I felt I knew them, because the show gave me insight into them, they're relationships, feelings and continued to invest and develop their characters. Until TTOTD there has been no such investment in Clara by the shows writers. It seems like they have begun to amend this, and I look forward to a new season which isn't ball-gagged by a 'mystery' companion.

 TLDR: No, many of us feel unable to connect with Clara due to the shows lack of investment in her character. The companion needs to be more than an auto cue of witty responses with the Doctor, because when we can connect with the companion we feel we are travelling with the Doctor ourselves.

I had informed them of my last address, but not the one before, which still fell within the 3 year period. Being a student I'd moved about a lot and not been as organised as I should've been. 

I entered all addresses into the form, even the one which the DVLA didn't know about, and it wouldn't let me progress and prompted me to call them. I called and it seemed my account had locked me out so I had to wait 20 mins (I waited 24 hours) before trying again. 

This time I tried only the addresses which the DVLA were aware of. Again, the same problem with it prompting me to call them.

After this I gave up with doing it online and called up another number to do it over the phone instead. For this process I'm quite sure, but not 100%, that they only asked me for the address currently on the license and that which I wanted to change it to. They did need information from my photocard and paper counterpart however, so make sure you have both of these handy. I'd advise doing it that way because it was pretty quick and painless for me. 

As I said I can't be 100% that they wont ask for the previous 3 years, but I'm relatively sure. In general I wouldn't worry too much anyway, I think the fine is more if you get caught out by them/the police.

If you're good enough you'll move up a year or two, maybe at 15-16 you'll play for the U18s. U18 you'll go to U21 and stay there. If you're good enough then, you'll move to the first team.

When the show specifically called out John Smith's and Professor Yana's pocket watches, it did it in an overt *Pay attention to me because I'm important* manner. It wasn't a random detail in the scenery dressing of a bedroom.

Coincidences do happen, even on Steven Moffat shows. I know fans want to give the man more credit than that, but don't. He writes mysteries, but he follows the rules of mystery writing. The main one is make the twist obvious early on so perceptive fans can get it on repeat viewings. This is what good mystery writers do. They don't call out a detail unless it means something.

*. We don't see Martha Jones or Donna Noble as babies either. Does that mean they are Time Lords also? Can people simply have unknown childhoods? Or, do we have to see them as babies, like Clara, in order for us to accept they were babies?

*. You can have exactly that situation where it worked in one episode and does not in another. This is a television show and the needs of the plot trump logic. Again, you are making things fit together when they don't. You are also adding connections that did not exist in the first place. 

A lot of this theory relies on you looking for connections that aren't even there in the first place. It also relies on cherrypicked details to work.

Unless everyone *in the world* changes over a short period, what will happen? You can change your software and retrain all your users....but any new starters will still need training. Any incoming docs which are still in the format everyone else uses will still need converting. Any systems that need upgrading will still need more expensive devs (which will always be the case unless linux becomes more popular on desktops and servers than windows). That's just for starters.

&gt;None of those will be any more expensive than MS

Actually they will - you're not incorporating just how many systems (like single sign-on, DFS etc.) come out-of-the-box when you pay for the license. To implement these as an equivalent is a much different prospect under another OS, and some can't be achieved at all.

&gt;And besides, there's nothing to stop the gov getting their own developers.

true,nycsurfer,num22,,"First, your responses seem so short-sighted.  As someone who claims to know more than everyone else here, I just don't know why you are so eager to sell players.  This is a fucking squad.  Not a starting 11 plus a 5 man bench.  We need rotation, something that I think Sherwood has been lacking.  Maybe we don't need as much as AVB, but we need more than Redknapp.  FWIW, this is my uneducated opinion.  I have not been a lifelong fan, but I am a pretty smart guy and this is what I've decided based on my experience watching this team and watching the other top teams (esp Bayern who has depth that won't quit).

Second, you listed a bunch of players to play the CM spots... Of those players, Paulinho and Sandro are currently not match fit (specifically not saying injured, cause I don't actually know their status).  Dembele has a recurring hip problem.  Eriksen is our starter, agreed.  Siggy is good backup, fine.  But I want more than backup.  I want DEPTH.  We could go out there today and have Dembele come off cause of his hip and a bad tackle on Eriksen.  This is not that far-fetched and then what?  Bentaleb (who I don't rate yet) pairs with who?  

I want depth and lots of it.  I want players fighting for their first team spots.  I want to be able to rest players that play all the time in order to prevent the March/April implosion.  Getting rid of the depth players doesn't accomplish that, especially when so many of our players are injury-prone!  

&gt;Kaboul is back now

For how long?  You make this argument like our players come back and are instantly ready to go.  How often do we see them disappear for another month after coming back.  Or have their return date pushed further out?

As for the EL, you're forgetting the travel involved.  Dnipro is not simply across town.

Finally, I'm done arguing with you.  I don't care how tired you are of people missing the point or how you have to tell us a million times what you think or how you think you are always right.   I replied for the sake of conversation but it's pointless.  It's not a conversation with you.  It's me trying to make a point and getting told how wrong I am.

For strikes to be effective they need cooperation from all unions across the country in one set time.

&gt;If other unions used similar tactics which disadvantaged further unions, the disadvantaged union would not and should not be happy.

Ok so it's based on the premise that striking teachers are only hurting students. As I explained in my very first comment, these cuts are affecting everyone, including students.

&gt;

&gt;A **footmouse** (also spelled **foot mouse**) is a type of computer [mouse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse_(computer\)) that gives the users the ability to move the [cursor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursor_(computers\)) and click the mousebuttons with their feet.

&gt;It is primarily used by users with [disabilities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability) or with high-back or [neck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck) problems. It is also promoted as a way to prevent such problems in the future and as a means to increase productivity by not having to move one's hand between the [keyboard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard) and mouse.

It's costs are made up of both fixed costs which stay the same regardless of how much business it does in a time period, and variable costs which depend on how much business it does.

Over a time period with fluctuating demand, it makes sense to adapt pricing to demand to ensure your services are still being used. 

When there's low demand, and the price is low, the company might not actually be making a profit, but providing you're still taking more per sale than the unit cost, you're paying something towards your fixed costs.

When there's high demand, and the price is high, the company can take money to pay for the remainder of the fixed costs and generate it's profit.

In fact, if companies didn't discount when demand was low, fewer people might buy, and so the company takes less in these periods, and the price would actually be higher in the periods of high demand.",0,1391012757,null,0,false,0,cf1v79a,t3_1wgn5g,t1_cf1v79a,t1_cf1s8y3,null,1432160133,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Observations:

Salah has pace for days, he's like Kuyt on meth.

Konoplyanka's definitely got pace, but he looks to manage his efforts a little more than Salah who's full tilt the whole time.

Konoplyanka looks like he's got a way better touch and keeps the ball tight, very good on the ball.

Salah is smaller, which doesn't always translate well in the prem. 

Salah does have some solid UCL experience, where it looks like Konoplyanka has been playing in Europa.

Konoplyanka has a better shot from range, especially cutting in from the left on his right foot (watch any video of his).

I think Salah has more experience in Europe and he's a more pacey player, but Konoplyanka is more dynamic and has a better shot. 

ESPN has him in an article as the 'Ukranian Robben' - I think that's a hell of a compliment, but it does explain some of his dynamism. He'll take a guy one on one to the end line, but he'll also distribute or cut in and burn you with his right foot. I think Konoplyanka is a jack of a few trades where Salah is a very specific type of attacking player (which I think we have in Sterling - who stretches the hell out of play).

The biggest difference between villa and everton was that Coutinho, Gerrard and Sterling were much more disciplined on defense.

Brendan has constantly shown that he's willing to change the formation depending on who is in form or who were playing. I agree though that theres no place for Lucas if BR wants to play a single pivot as Gerrard just cant play the role that Hendo is playing for us now.

true,MyboNehr,lfc68,,"I think the decisions for the future of the team are entirely revolved around Gerrard. 

**This** **is** **pure** **speculation** **by** me.**

Gerrard will be a regista for us. (He's world class, and in no time will adapt to the demands of that position. He's a multi-dimensioned and highly experience human being and I have full faith in his ability to master that position by season's end.)

Active midfielders who can play defense and attack will support Gerrard. That's why the focus probably isn't a pure DM, it's been wide attacking players. We have 3, maybe 4 (if you want to include Coutinho based on his performance yesterday) midfielders who can be that engine around G8. 

Our focus has, I think, been on fast wide players, because they are the x-factor for linking the composed and grinding midfield with the free-flowing attack. They are the players that are high enough up the field to take on defenders without giving away fast breaks and distribute to the best 2 strikers in the league, or score themselves. However, they are also fast, and therefore capable of dropping back to be the frontline of defensive cover too. 

Sterling has shown exactly that type of play this season, and I think BR is hoping to replicate that on the other side of the field with players like Konoplyanka. 

I know you'll bring up our players out on loan and where they may fit for the future when they come back, and that more attackers aren't necessary. I don't really have a great answer to dispute that. My only guess would be that we are fully preparing for life in Europe next year, and the players coming back are our depth for the more packed schedule next year. 

Our philosophy on new transfers is revolved around the evolution of Gerrard, and his new role, I think. So, personally, I think the ""we need a DM"" call just isn't what's on Liverpool's mind. We have Lucas, and he will be our defensive rock when we need him.

His defensive work was outstanding! He's always had the desire to press but I have never seen him tackle so successfully before. If he can keep it up it will be huge for us, as he will take some pressure off of Gerrard and Hendo in the midfield.

I think this game shows why he has to be played at the 10. Brilliant touch and composure under pressure, and of course his phenomenal passing. He can pull all the strings from the center and can't be taken out of the game like he can if he's out wide.

Around Christmas time I made a post analyzing his season so far. All of his statistics (key passes, pass totals, pass percentages, dribbles, etc.) were up from last year, except for goals and assists. I argued he was still creating many chances but they weren't being taken. His shooting has been poor, but it has also been unlucky - the post vs. Everton was his 5th of the season!

I really think he's about to break out into a hot streak. With SASS so deadly and threatening, Coutinho at the 10 is going to pick everyone apart, just like he did yesterday. He could have had at least 3 assists - Sturridge's last miss and Sterling's penalty among others.

true,binaryv01d,null,null,"There's one thing that is never factored into these calculations: does the software do what it does *well*? 

Most of the time, in corporate IT, the answer is a resounding 'no'. Software, particularly anything that faces the end-user, is generally awful. This results in a huge amount of lost productivity - I should think I spend half my working day waiting for the software/hardware to catch up with what I'm doing. That's a massive hidden cost. 

Is open-source software better quality? I guess it varies - from awesome stuff like the Linux kernel, Postgres and Git, to software that just doesn't quite match up to its proprietary rivals, like LibreOffice.

One definite advantage is that you can 'try before you buy' to your heart's content - a far cry from the proprietary software that is bought purely on the basis of bullet points on a PowerPoint slide and the quality of the lunch the sales rep took the managers to. 

Really, though, I think the problem is the procurement process. After all, there is - among the crap - also excellent proprietary software that you'd be a fool to ignore. Most large organisations just don't have technical people in the decision-making roles. This is important, because non-technical people generally find it very difficult to see through the sales bullshit. IBM and Oracle will be perfectly happy to sell you very expensive support contracts for open-source software, whether it meets your needs or not.

If the government wants to go open source, it needs to hire (competent!) in-house developers and contribute back towards the projects it uses. If every large organisation did this, it would be much more cost-effective - all the money spent would go into improving software, not into large tech companies' piggy banks. LibreOffice could be a formidable opponent to Microsoft Office, etc. 

This would also solve the procurement problem - in-house developers would be able to choose exactly the right solutions, and they would be able to provide support. Adopting a new piece of software would become cheap - there would be no need to pay for new licensing or support, and that would help keep non-technical (i.e. bean-counting) management out of the procurement decisions.

A Person (A) commits an offence if - 

**a) he intentionally penetrates the vagina, anus or mouth of another person (B) with his penis,**

b) B does not consent to the penetration, and

c) A does not reasonably believe that B consents.

Male on male rape ABSOLUTELY counts as rape in England and Wales.

With a ped which should have a top speed of 28mph its fairly easy to test with a LIDAR device and a stretch of empty road.

true,momin_q,null,null,"He's been getting a fair amount of minutes. In the beginning when he was on super form, he would start every game non-stop. Many people were even questioning Ancelotti by saying that he should be getting some rest as he's still very young. Then, about a month ago, he suffered a drastic dip in form, nobody seems to known why. Ever since, Ancelotti has been trying to adjust the team to see which players work well in what position and with which other players. A few times, Modric and Di Maria would try out the CF/CAM role (Isco's postion), but that didn't appear to out work so well. As you can see [here](http://www.whoscored.com/Teams/52/Show/-Real-Madrid) or [here](http://www.whoscored.com/Players/82989/Fixtures/Isco), even with all the changes/adjustments, he's been getting sufficient minutes.

As far as satisfaction goes, I don't think he's indicated that he's unhappy. Recently, it might appear as though he's trying too hard to impress/get back into form by trying to do everything himself. He might appear to be a bit selfish when he's constantly trying to dribble through the opposition when passes would suffice, but I don't see that relating to unhappiness.

Just to be serious for a second, though. Think about it. You want to give everybody in society a chance at a tech job?

See, when you had Microsoft everywhere, you had to have Microsoft-trained workers to administer that installation.

But with open suites and standards *anybody* with access to the Internet can teach themselves - as well as download the software and learn how to use it *for free*.

This greatly opens the pool of available talent and also offers the poorest in society an opportunity to work in IT if they are prepared to teach themselves.

CM area is tricky.  I thought our #1 goal this window was to get a good CDM (Fernando??).  The game yesterday and subsequent analysis changed my view on this.  Someone said that even if Lucas is fit, he'd have trouble breaking into the team and here's why.  Gerrard did really well yesterday but it's also a reflection of the midfield system as a whole.  Instead of having one dedicated midfield anchor, like Lucas, who offers little going forward, playing the Coutinho Gerrard Henderson trio is more balanced.  Defensively, ALL THREE will have to contribute. for example, Coutinho did really well defensively yesterday.  Henderson has really good energy and drive to complement Gerrard's more tactical style.  Offensively, Coutinho breaks really well when going forward and Gerrard still has his passing range.  I'm still not convinced about Allen, he needs to get more nimble or stronger.  He gives the ball away too much.  ",0,1391021580,null,0,false,0,cf1zfc0,t3_1whfz9,t1_cf1zfc0,t3_1whfz9,null,1432162176,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0

true,aM_7,lfc68,,"I wrote the following on the post match thread against Everton.

&gt;I didn't expect the kind of positional discipline from him on a match like this. Maybe it was that he was the first on the score sheet, and that set him up to be content with his role for the rest of the match. Or, perhaps you can teach an old dog new tricks. 

&gt;Either way, Flanno and Sterling were pivotal to keeping the skipper in position. With Henderson and Coutinho also working the covering so well, it was as if Gerrard was the quarterback and the rest were his linemen. They kept coverage, and the skipper never had to leave his""box"". Amazing application of the 433 formation.

&gt;It was an almost perfect performance in one of the best and most significant of fixtures. I am excited for what was shown by the boys today. The tactics and the heart displayed today should motivate for what's to come this season. And Anfield should be ecstatic in anticipation for the home games against top 4 opposition. YNWA!

For primary school it's more about literacy &amp; numeracy rates.

As others have said, go and visit the schools too. But don't be fooled. They will only show you well behaved classes (if any) and the nice facilities. For example, my old school recently had a ~£40million rebuild. It looks amazing and has great facilities now, but it's still not a brilliant school. It's good, but there are better ones in the area. So don't be fooled by facilities either. 

Edit: I noticed in another post here you're in Kent. There will more than likely be grammar schools near you and I know that for a lot of Kent you can just get a train to the best ones. I highly highly highly recommend them for when your kids are 11. Please, for their benefit, apply to them. I'm just finishing my schooling at a grammar school and wish I had gone there for the whole of my secondary education. It's not for everyone admittedly, but those it's not for won't get in. If your kids get in, they will get a great education and are far more likely to get top grades and into top universities.

true,Larseth,eng-gloucestershire,Gloucestershire,"I am unaware as to if the figures are correct however in my experience the best way of dealing with this issue is to wait until the end of the financial year. Shortly after this your employer will provide you with your P60 form which breaks down your entire earnings and tax payments for you. Check that against what you expected and see if there is a discrepancy, chances are if you have under paid then HMRC will be all over you like a rash and will ask for the payment within i think 40 days. In the case of under or over payment you will get a letter, normally around the same time you get your P60 form.

You may find that your tax will go up in the coming months if you have indeed underpaid however the person in your workplace who deals with the payroll should be able to inform you of this.

For any queries i would look at the HMRC website or give them a call. In many cases if there is an issue they will ask you to send copies of a load of stuff to them.

Good Luck!

Looking at the remaining fixtures of each squad, City has to go @ Man U and then @ Arsenal back to back. They also have to play @ both Merseyside squads. Chelsea is clear of Man U and only face Man City Sunday and Liverpool away at the end of April. Much more favorable road IMO which might be what's prompting Mourinho to cheer for the two horse race.

-Just for practice, a defensive formation change to 3 CM's later in the game (leaving Matic, Ramires and Mikel/Lampard on). I suggest 3 CM's because I think we're playing 3 CM's against Man City later.

-Hazard w/ 10 dribbles

-David Luiz playing CB without any simple defensive lapses

-Demba Ba to get some real play time. Hopefully start, but I would be fine with half an hour

And I don't think I've seen Allen hit any long balls, not that it would be crucial but it is definitely a nice-to-have ability in that position.
Allen is definitely better at passing than Lucas and may be better at playing box-box than Hendo, but defensively I would bank on Henderson over Allen. Hendo is also good in the air.

I've watched a few documentaries about cycling in places like the Netherlands and very few cyclists wear helmets. I'm all for the de-lycrafication of cyclists. Helmets, although proven to make travelling safer, are part of the problem.

true,ruizscar,cnty-expat,South America,"&gt; Before automation, more than 40% of society was involved in agricultural work. Now it is less than 1%. Huge displacement led to humans relocating en masse to cities. But there still was plenty of work left to humans because it required more than just simple repetitive movements. It required object recognition, navigational abilities, decision making and at least 3 degrees of movement. Now there will be no field of activity left untouched. These are not simple mechanical tools anymore. They can recognize, can navigate, can make decisions and actually do have 3 degrees of movement. And most importantly they reached a point of being cheap to manufacture.

He was hugely cut up about it, became depressed, dropped out of university (although he eventually went back to a different uni) and still feels unbelievable guilt about it to this day over 20 years later.

He is now one of the best drivers I know, takes driving safely more seriously than anyone else I've ever met and is the person I'd trust more than anyone else never to cause a death whilst behind the wheel. 

I have a strong belief in a retributive justice system, lean politically to the right on just about all law and order issues and would be the first to say that if he killed someone whilst driving again he should get life behind bars. But at the same time banning him from driving for the rest of his life would have ruined his life chances and in all likelihood eventually resulted in him driving without a licence or insurance and a reckless attitude towards driving. Instead he is a researcher who drives to work, pays his taxes and tries to make the world a better place.

The way I see it, we don't intend to, or want to sell anyone. However if a player really wants to leave to play champions league football and a club are willng to pay over the odds for them, we will seriously consider it.

Until you are in the champions league, nothing is certain because that higher level is always there.

That is why we say ""we have no plans to sell anyone"". ""Plans"" is the key word, it feels like there is always potential to sell because ""plans"" are not final outcomes.

Thats what I think anyhow!

 [**Skinhead**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skinhead): 

---

&gt;A **skinhead** is a member of a [subculture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subculture) that originated among [working class](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_class) youths in [London](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London), [England](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England) in the 1960s and then soon spread to other parts of the [United Kingdom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom), and later to other countries around the world. Named for their close-cropped or [shaven heads](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_shaving), the first skinheads were greatly influenced by [West Indian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies) (specifically [Jamaican](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica)) [rude boys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rude_boy) and British [mods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mod_(subculture\)), in terms of fashion, music and [lifestyle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology\)). Originally, the skinhead subculture was mainly based on those elements, not politics or [race](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_human_beings\)), in fact many British Skinheads during the 1960s were Black.

Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.

Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.

There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux.

He is an *awful* commentator. He sides with the underdog on almost every close call. I think he learned it in commentating school because then there is ""drama"" and ""controversy"" when there is in fact none.

That half wasn't too inspiring, so in order to keep people engaged, he has followed his usual trick of inventing controversy where there was none. It's what you need to do when your expensive team haven't got much to talk about.

This match, they've actually shut him up a bit.

He's still doing the ""they look dangerous from set pieces for me"" thing - he says that about every team that gets a lot of corners and don't piss them away - and he is also doing the usual ""well, when I played""-style reminiscing that leads to huge assumptions, extrapolations and inferences that might not actually be valid. 

Hamstring injuries, intentions of a defender, intentions of a striker, mid-field scrambles for the ball: he knows what they were thinking. He knows what everybody is thinking. He's so *wise* you see. Except he is a boring pillock who spent most of his playing career being uncreative on the pitch, and by some accounts in the bookies off the pitch.

I pay for BT Sport because I'm on Sky as a package, and I would happily continue to give them money if they got rid of him because Sky needs a competitor with some balls the next time the rights come up.

The No campaign claiming that [Scots would have to pay roaming charges if they voted for Independence](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/telecoms/10150160/Mobile-phone-users-could-incur-roaming-charges-if-Scotland-gains-independence.html) the very day that prices for them were reduced in preparation [for their removal the next year](http://ec.europa.eu/news/science/130916_en.htm)

The notion that the prospect of Independence was damaging investment in Scotland when [it was up by 16%](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-23431486)

or my personal favourite, the Idea that if Scotland went Independent the MoD would [annex Faslane Naval base](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/jul/10/mod-trident-scotland-independence), which only took [2 hours before they realised such a threat was the type that made people angry, not scared](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jul/11/trident-base-no-10-disowns-mod-faslane-sovereignty).

This is a short list of a much wider campaign, you may have heard the term ""project fear"" to describe the No campaign, what might surprise you is that this was coined by people working *for* the No campaign, even the deputy of the Scottish conservatives said that [""some of the arguments against Independence are becoming silly""](https://twitter.com/JacksonMSP/status/351057431746461697)

true,gregzorian,flair8,,"Absolutely right. The red ""for denial of a goal-scoring opportunity"" is only if the player is outside the box--a rule that was implemented to weed out taking out the opponent on a breakaway before he reached the penalty area. If a penalty is awarded, then that is meant to be the punishment, not a red. So if the referee was applying that rule, he got it horribly wrong.

There is also the possibility that the referee was showing the red because was just a malicious challenge. It clearly wasn't. So he's wrong in that regard too.

Moreover, I don't even think there was contact. If there was it was very little, but I would say that it's a dive. Wouldn't be the first time we saw that from Dzeko. Furthermore, Rose gets the ball and kicks it away. Now, maybe it's a foul simply because it was a bit reckless and from behind, meaning from Rose's perspective, he could have ended up causing more contact. If that's the reason, fine. Penalty. But in no way do I see this as a red. I just can't think of an explanation.

Note: the referee wasn't going to give a penalty at all. He only gave it because the line judge told him too.

Ok, that said I thought the team played alright. Substitutions were good but way too late. I thought Mikel brought nothing in the first half. He doesn't move the ball forward in the way that you need to against that defense. Frank should have come on at half. He brought something to the game that was nonexistent for the entire match until he came on. I don't think West Ham could have played 10 more minutes with him on the pitch without conceding. 

Frustrating game. Won't kill us but Monday is a huge match. A draw would suffice but may not be enough in the end. I don't see City dropping many points to other teams the rest of the season.

Whereas in any ol' movie people'd hate it for being far-fetched. I feel sometimes they go too far for their own good, and they probably don't have anything to hold them back in that. As with any big, popular phenomenon, fans of the show are probably looking at it through sweet-tinted glasses. Meaning, a part of why people like Doctor Who is because it's Doctor effing Who.

The problem is that is soon as people not controlled by the Scottish government , the Market will set a rate, based on how they evaluate Scotland's ability to repay it's debts etc.

E,g. 
Small country, spending like crazy = less likely to be credit worthy than the rest of the uk, so the Market exchange rate goes down, even if the official government rate is 1:1.  Worse still for the Scottish government, this overly official high exchange rate, means that Scotland eother ends  up subsidising currency speculators (if scotland honours the 1:1 rate), or ends up looking even less creditworthy (driving the exchange rate down still further).

If scotlands wants it's own currency, and a 1:1 exchange rate with the rest of the uk, it needs to be *more* fiscally prudent than the rest of the uk, given that there are lot of doubts about the Scottish economy, the country's relatively small size (see recent experience of other small european countries with high debt levels), and the uncertainty about things like eu membership,  etc.

Seriously, can anybody see an snp Scottish government being more fiscally responsible than the government of the rest of the uk?

true,ThisBoysGotWoe,null,null,"&gt;The red ""for denial of a goal-scoring opportunity"" is only if the player is outside the box--a rule that was implemented to weed out taking out the opponent on a breakaway before he reached the penalty area. If a penalty is awarded, then that is meant to be the punishment, not a red. So if the referee was applying that rule, he got it horribly wrong.

This is not true at all. To quote the [Interpretation of Law 12](http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/worldfootball/clubfootball/01/37/04/28/law12-en.pdf) (the last section entitled ""Denying a goal or an obvious goalscoring opportunity""):
&gt;There are two sending-off offences that deal with denying an opponent an 
obvious opportunity to score a goal. It is not necessary for the offence to occur 
inside the penalty area.

There is an exception if advantage is given and the attacking team subsequently scores. In that case, it is only a yellow. But in this case, if the referee calls the foul, he is pretty much bound by the laws to send Rose off for DOGSO.

In my opinion, while Rose does get ball first (though that itself doesn't necessarily mean it's a fair tackle), it is a really risky tackle and is very easy for refs to view as a foul at full speed.",0,1391033503,null,0,false,0,cf25nzo,t3_1whuur,t1_cf25nzo,t1_cf24mrg,null,1435512126,7,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,7

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"British Muslims find it offensive for various explicit and implicit reasons. Someone will give you the actual doctrinal reasons - ie. no images. 

I think the actual issue is a lot deeper. This stems from a mixture of things. 

Firstly, Muslims love the Prophet. Unless you have that belief its very difficult to understand the depth to which that attachment goes. Even with my belief in freedom of speech, seeing a picture of Mohammad and one that is meant to offend hurts me almost like a slap to the face. 

Couple that with a lot of social issues. The cartoon issue has become symbolic of the lack of power that a lot of Muslims feel that they have. Thus it takes on an extra significance. 

To British Muslims the image is basically someone stamping on their identity and they seem to be unable to do anything about it. This is common in many societies, if you take the issue of flags and marches in NI for example. 

Thus ,rightly or wrongly, you create a mythology around the cartoon, that it's been built to slight you and hurt you. It's the powers that be rubbing your nose in it. This couples with the constant Islamaphobia, the various conflicts involving Muslims around the world creates a narrative of victimisation that appeal to a few people.

1. exiting.

Well we do have more variety of food as a result of immigrants. Curry being one of the UK's favorite meals. In the last few years i have tried Ethiopian food, Iranian food and some decent Moroccan food which I probably wouldn't have had without immigration. 

For me personally that is about it as far as making UK more exiting. Maybe I need to get out more.

2 Healthier

By this I assume you mean society in general? I am not sure. Immigrants have integrated here much better than some other countries, and may work much needed jobs. The nhs would fail to run without immigration, and we have many doctors, scientists and professionals who came form other countries.

We also have a lot of low skilled migrants who could potentially be a drain on society and potentially could cause upset when they are trapped in poverty, somewhat like what happened in Sweden with the riots.

I think in some ways they have made the UK healthier and maybe a little more exiting, but it isn't all good. I can feel public sentiment shifting. We need immigration but I think the balance has been off a little with too many migrants entering the UK in the past decade or so. I think if we made it much easier for highly skilled migrants to come to the UK and harder for low skilled migrants then that would make the UK more exiting and healthier.",0,1391034599,null,0,false,0,cf267s6,t3_1wdzvj,t1_cf267s6,t3_1wdzvj,null,1432165509,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

All I can say, and it's obvious as fuck - it's staged. Seriously staged. The camera crews are hanging around waiting for a sniff of drama. Something was unideal about my working conditions, so the second the director caught wind of it, they swooped in and got us to re-enact everything, complete with staged over-reaction from the partygoers and family. I honestly got the feeling it was the parents egging on the awfulness of the children on purpose. They were behind it, not her.

Also, the house looked good-ish on screen but IRL was... Awful. A million pound hack job. Everything about the child, her friends, her house and its grounds was a nouveau-riche dry heave.

Mata was a bench warmer and rather than have him sit out his contract on the bench, Mourinho decided to act like a human being and sell Mata to the only club that made a real offer.  Part of this money was used to buy a replacement in Salah and part of it was put aside for the summer transfer window to hopefully sign a new striker (you know, to strengthen an actual position of weakness in the team).

Now, as far as the West Ham game is concerned, Chelsea had 39 shots but no goals.  The problem was the finishing, not the chance creation.  Under Rafa, when Chelsea would fail to score and only have like 4 shots during the game, chance creation was the issue.

Now on to the players you mentioned.  Willian is a fantastic fast, skilled player and has been a great addition to the squad.  He was a Mourinho purchase and Mourinho, in case you've forgotten, has two CL medals, 2 PL medals, 2 Serie A medals, and a La Liga medal; long story short, he fucking knows what he's doing.  Eto'o was bought as cover for Torres and now that Torres is hurt he's being used as cover for Torres (whoa, what a fucking novel idea, buying squad players).  Ramires is the backbone of the midfield and he does a whole lot more than just run.  Exhibit A: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pss6AU1npmM scoring against the best team in the world at a point when Chelsea had all but given the game away Exhibit B: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlSFivmemyw dribbling through a Man City defense like it's nothing.  Exhibit C: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeLKaRN_Ss making Lindegaard his bitch after doing one of those silly runs you were talking about.

Now, on to my comment.  Chelsea had plenty of chances and failed to score from them against a West Ham defense that had 11 men behind the ball for the whole game.

I never said that. I offered you an explanation of why it's seen as offensive. Actually most Muslims are offended by the way people take the piss out of Jesus ( a Prophet) and generally abuse the sacred. 

However, the issue you raise isn't a Muslim issue, it's a society issue. IF we were living in a perfectly equal society you could enforce a rule of total free speech. 

But, we don't live in a society of free speech. We live in a society where freedom of speech and the right to say what you want is mitigated by the different way offence is treated.  Thus as a society we already put limits on free speech and take account of offence. 

In that respect, a minority group can ask why it's rights are not being protected as offence when other groups are. For example we had men convicted for poppy burning (an action which I found despicable). 

So this negotiation has to be two way, by necessity because we've already set a precedent of what is offensive and what is not.

This goes against everything I've ever held close to my heart.  The us-vs-them mentality.

It also reminds me - and this possibly sticks in the throat more - that to the average Liverpool FC fan, their biggest game, their biggest rivals, isn't Everton... It's Man Utd.

If there's one thing I'd love to see, and I accept in the wider perspective it shouldn't matter, is that those over the park start to *fear us*, to *respect us*, to start to dread derby day.

We can finish above them in the league come the end of the season for year after year after year, but I don't think they will fear/respect/dread us.  It'll take many years, and quite a few trophies, before that happens.  And that is something I find unbelievably galling.

So, as a player, you must play knowing that any lunge in the box is highly likely to be punishable by a penalty, and possibly a red card.

Of course Rose is going for the ball, and of course he's trying to stop a shot on goal.  But he's coming at it from an angle that immediately gives him a disadvantage in the referee's eyes.

It was an incorrect decision to be sure, but I won't for a second argue that it was a BAD decision.  I dare say pretty much any other ref in the EPL would've given it the same way.  And that's because it looked bad, and was a bad decision by Rose.

For ease of use and user-friendliness, you can't go far wrong with Ubuntu or one of its associated distributions or derivatives; Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Linux Mint etc. With vanilla Ubuntu there are some privacy concerns owing to the way Unity handles information put into the search bar because of a little feature called ""scopes"" that packages your query and broadcasts it across the internet. Not the best way to do things really. However, Canonical (the London/J'burg-based company behind Ubuntu) offers support along with the Ubuntu community, who tend to be quite welcoming and friendly, and there's an awful lot of documentation available to help you more easily patch any holes that could appear in your user experience (e.g. lack of native Netflix support for Linux systems).

If you don't mind a moderate learning curve and perhaps a bit of work tweaking it to properly work with your hardware, OpenSUSE is a very nice distribution, backed by Novell. Again, the community is great and very helpful, though sometimes documentation can be either thin on the ground or outright arcane.

Alternatively if you're after getting into the true hobbyist DIY spirit and tweaking every last thing imaginable, there's Arch Linux. Once again, a wonderful community with lots of spirit with an almost religious zeal for correct documentation, though there is an extraordinarily steep learning curve here with the potential for a lot to go wrong.

Of course there are other OS out there; FreeBSD and the like; but I haven't enough experience with them to be able to guide you in any meaningful way or help you make an informed decision.

Torres and Eto'o are certainly more experienced than Lukaku and, if direct quotes from the manager and player are to be believed, Lukaku asked to be loaned, presumably because he realized he wouldn't be a starter ahead of Torres.  Also, the finishing was shit from every player on the field, not just the strikers.  Lastly, Lukaku has scored 1 goal in his last 9 starts (not including the Liverpool game as he got injured early on), so he's not exactly banging them in at the moment, either.

Your exact words.

For the 3-0 over West Ham, this is how football works; some days games go your way and some days they don't.  In that game, Chelsea got an early goal so West Ham couldn't defend with 11 men behind the ball the whole game as they were playing from behind, but in this game Chelsea got no such goal so West Ham just had to play for the point.

When I went through the education system, finishing my schooling in 2003, the IT GCSE wasn't even considered and computers were rare as rocking horse shite.

We were all but kept in the dark and clueless when it came to using computers and technology. We were never taught about UNIX or -like systems, only Microsoft, because enterprise used it hence the future workforce should too. Computers were reduced to VERY expensive typewriters due to inadequate teaching and a few too many pub lunches 'twixt administrative staff and the business brains over at county hall.

Point being, we need better IT teaching in schools. The standards even now are absolutely awful, the reliance on Microsoft as 'industry standard' and an inability to think beyond the bounds of a single software program are still hallmarks of the UK's education system, even up at University level.

In a perfect world i'd love cyclists to have their own space. Indeed they do in many newer towns. But I don't think it's feasible to make these lanes in the majority of London. I look at the road space, then the pavement space, and I don't see where they are going to fit. So with that in mind, I feel that maybe cyclists could be a bit more thoughtful - like they seem to expect everyone else to be.

I agree that running red lights when people are crossing is a bell end mover. But no one does it on a bike at 40mph. If they could they would be pro racers.

2. Siggy, as much as we love him, should not have been started. With all the other winger options we have, not sure why we went with him. Siggy, is also not Top 4 material. He was invisible this entire game, as is the case in most big matches.

3. Bentaleb. The press, many on this sub, and probably some experienced coaches in the PL will be rubbing this one in Les Ferdinand's face. You need a holding midfielder, especially when you have a player like Silva in between midfield and the front line. The man has more assists in the EPL's history than anyone else.

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;but surely as much of the parodies of Christ are mostly in the context of him being the son of god, its mocking a part of Jesus that Muslims don't believe?

No, Muslims still believe that it's mocking Jesus and thus mocking the Sacred. Yes, they won't believe that Jesus is the Son of God, but the pictures of him being mocked are still mocking the personality of Jesus. 

I think the wider point about offence is important. As a society we've decided holocaust denial is an offence, burning poppies is an offence, burning the Queen's image is both a legal and cultural offence. So we , as a society have decided that there is a line to be crossed. 

In that respect, the mocking of Mohammed could be seen as something similar - an abuse of a symbolic totem. I would argue that it would be same as images of the Gollywog and big lipped racial stereotypes that are rightly called out for being deeply offensive. This is because the racial stereotype of the Golliwog itself may be a cartoon figure - but the deeper symbology is one of race hate.  It could be argued that the cartoon of Mohammad are seen by Muslims as a form of race-hate and race-baiting. 

The other thing is that people use this argument to push a vision of civilisation and integration that they want. The image is used as a way of manifesting the superiority of a culture or belief system versus another. It's not just an innocent use of a cartoon. 

The people who did the cartoon are specifically to make a political point about thier values being better and how others should get used to it. 

Now if this was a totally equal society where there was no imbalance of power and control then that would be a fair argument to make. 

But the power in our society is balanced against the poor and the vulnerable. The people who made this cartoon are taking advantage of their position near the top of the power pyramid for granted and then abusing it to bash those who don't have that power. 

Again, a comparison with the African Americans is a good one. Uncle Tom's cabin could be seen as a mild victorian morality tale. But it's not, it's an exercise in setting out the values that white protestant america believed that the african americans should live by. Ask an African American how they would feel if you called them an Uncle Tom now?

Also, lets say in Salah's case, or in this case we pay the full price and not the price we value him, then would you people be happy that we stick with our valuation for future buys? the answer is no, people will still bitch in the summer that we should pay more to get other players.

true,kharma45,,Belfast,"&gt; The amount of civil servants it needed to hire to go through and check who got free and who didn't etc apparently it was cheaper to get rid of a massive civil servant division of box tickers

Could everyone not just pay a flat rate? Free prescriptions were envisaged to cost £13m pa by the health service when brought in but the BBC reported in 2011 it was actually £30m. It's a cost I can't see being sustained. Even a charge of £1 per item (up to a maximum figure of something like £5 as some do get a lot of items, I've seen scripts with 15 or 16 items on them) would generate a lot of cash and not impact hugely upon most.

&gt; without massive investment in public transport and roads, this takes time and extra money.

Which needs to be done. I get sad looking at the motorway plans from before the Troubles. It looked pretty fucking great. Instead we're left with dangerous single carriageway in so many areas.

&gt; Never use trains but it has been in the news about the passenger increase and the proposed investment. 

Yeah numbers are up (12.9m journeys in 2013 which was a huge increase of 1.6m the year previous) the  and they are a nice way to travel as our trains are actually pretty fucking nice machines, but it says something when the bus is usually faster than it both to Derry and to Dublin. The Dublin line especially needs a lot of work as at least the Derry line is reliable. The Enterprise train is shamefully bad but I would imagine there are more issues to work out when it's a cross border service.

Our rail network could be really good but it'll take a lot to get it up to standard with how sparse it currently is. Linking up to Belfast International (something EasyJet are big fans of doing) would be one of the easiest as the Lisburn-Antrim line is still in good condition as it's used for training and in the case of any diversions. 

There was also a proposal done in 2008 that figured it'd take £460m to get the Portadown to Derry line (linking up link Omagh, Strabane and Dungannon, with branches to Enniskillen and Armagh) up and running again. There's a bit about it here http://borderireland.info/info/mdetail.php?mref=1105

I'm going to give him a break, but I have no idea what the fuck our ""coach"" was thinking.  Hey, we spent a 100 million dollars over the course of the summer, lets play one of our youth players.  This makes sense.

I really like Bentaleb, and like to see him getting some minutes, but not all of the minutes against teams that annihilated us when we played with two holding midfielders.

I am really disliking Sherwoods team selection.  I really hope that Levy is out negotiating with someone else.

true,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"Yeah, it amazes me how short the memories of some people on here seem to be, given how much we've massively overpaid for players in the last decade or so.

* Downing - Bought for £20m, sold for £6m less than two years later.
* Carroll - Bought for £35m, sold for £15.5m
* Aquilani - Paid £17m, got back only £3m after less than 20 appearances
* Adam - Paid £7m, sold for £4m next season
* Dossena - £7m and sold for £4.5m a year later
* Poulsen - £4.5m sold for £1m a year later
* Keane - £19m sold for £12m six months later
* Diouf - £11m sold for £4m (and amazed we even got that much for the gobshite)

Now sure, hindsight is 20/20 and there are also transfers where we made money in that period, but total all that up and you've got £70m we've lost on players we've bought and then sold without getting our money's worth in between - there are plenty like Babel and Riera that I could have included and didn't bother to because the margins weren't quite as bad and they at least played quite a few games. 

That's £70m that could have bought us the likes of Ozil or Mata. We could have had two or maybe even three world class players, but instead we just pissed that money away paying more for a player like Carroll than we even did for Suarez or Torres.

Five years ago, we were in the 08/09 season with a squad that almost won us the Premiership, and we finished 14 points ahead of Arsenal with that squad. Since then we've had a net spend that is [£90m more than Arsenal have on transfers](http://www.transferleague.co.uk/league-tables/transfer-league-table-last-five-seasons.html) and yet they've done far better for their money in that time, because they're a club that don't spend stupidly in transfer windows. And their fans seem to bitch almost *every* transfer window about how Wenger isn't buying anyone, yet they've managed to consistently finish top four while we happily blew a load of money on mediocre players and completely slipped off the ball. 

We're naturally going to be nervous as fans if it doesn't look like we're improving the squad, especially if rivals are. And there's extra pressure this season because it's our best chance at top four in ages, but just panic buying players and paying over the odds because we feel we need to sign *somebody* isn't the way to do it. If anything, I'd say it's a big reason why we fell out of the top four so badly to begin with. If Spurs want to spend £25m on a player we value at £15m, then that's money they won't have available to spend in the summer that we will.

I like your analogy, but it is incomplete. 

You have to pay an annual retainer to your electrician or he'll take you to court. 

He won't tell you exactly how he's wired your house, so only he or his mates (with whom he's shared a few of his secrets) can go in and fix things up. Naturally as the only experts, they charge a premium. 

If he decides he doesn't like the make of your TV, it stops working. 

If he decides to change the amperage in your house, he may or may not give you the option to use your existing electronics and may or may not decide to charge you for the privilege. 

In my house, pretty much any qualified electrician knows how it works. Right now there aren't too many of them because the big housing developer has such a good deal with the monopoly electrician's outfit, so it can cost a bit to get someone good. However, there are many people out there who can give me help with a buzzing plug or other DIY issues.

Not trying to be a dick but a few million is not something you spare, even as a billionaire. And like i said, if we ""spared"" an extra few millions in this case, would that be it for you, or would you like us to spare an extra few millions every-time we buy someone?

""Even if that means we finish somewhere between 10th and 5th every year?""

Over paying for players does not guarantee success, i'm sure you would agree with that. We overpaid for Carroll, Downing, Aquilani and Cole and got left with shit players. Imagine if we had walked away from Cole and let Spurs have him, or walked away from Carroll, sure we might have gotten no one, but would that have been worse?  Spurs overpaid on a number of players this summer and spent over $100 Mill and do you think they got value for money? maybe if they walked away from some deals they wouldnt have a $30mill kid warming the bench and instead used that cash in Jan to buy a striker. 

All im saying is, its clear from the past that paying to much for a player is not always better then getting no one. Sometime its better to hold onto your cash till you find someone you value at $20mill, rather then spending $20 mill now because you're worried you might get nothing if you dont pay the extra cash. All smart business men, walk away from deals that cost more then they value, sometimes they lose but most time they win.

true,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"In the long run, I really don't think that's much to cry over though. For clubs that aren't City, Chelsea and to an almost similar extent Manchester United, overspending one season is always going to cost you in transfer funds later on (or just bankrupt you). And if the Fair Play rules actually work then that'll start cutting down on lavish fees too. 

Man Utd bought Van Persie for £22m the same season we bought Sturridge for £12m. Sturridge currently has a slightly better goals/game for us than RVP at Utd, and he's six years younger. They paid £12m and £15m for Kagawa and Zaha while we paid £8.5m for Coutinho. Suarez and Torres for £23m and £27m seem like bargains compared to what similar strikers have changed clubs for (and the fact we somehow got £50m back for Torres when he'd been useless for the previous 12 months).

It's more than possible to get quality players without paying over the odds for them, you've just got to be patient and wait for the smart deals to open up. If clubs want more than we think the player is worth, then it's worth moving on and going for players that look like better investments. And if a chance to buy a huge name like Ozil or Mata does come up then we've held onto the cash to go for moves like that.

And like i said, if we ""spared"" an extra few millions in this case, would that be it for you, or would you like us to spare an extra few millions every-time we buy someone?

That would be it for me. I think this season is our best chance to make top four, and the cash and player infusion THAT could bring is worth a little overspending. I wouldn't advocate it every window, but Manchester  United is in 7th right now. This kind of thing isn't just going to happen every season. We need to take advantage while the opportunity is there.

&gt;Over paying for players does not guarantee success, i'm sure you would agree with that. We overpaid for Carroll, Downing, Aquilani and Cole and got left with shit players.

Right, but that's a scouting issue. The reason those players sucked isn't that we overpaid, it's that they were poorly-chosen targets in the first place. Obviously I don't want us to overspend on players who won't make an impact on the team or don't fit the philosophy. 

&gt;All im saying is, its clear from the past that paying to much for a player is not always better then getting no one.  

I agree with that, but I don't think it's the case this window. We're in a unique position, and with one of our main rivals for a CL spot weakened in a way they probably won't be again. We're also totally decimated by injuries right now....and yes, we've got people coming back over the next month. Maybe. But remember when Enrique was coming back this month? Now it looks like he's out for the season.

If there was *ever* a time to overspend to get our top targets, it's now. Because if we miss CL, we can sell all the Suarez's we want.

Levy has always showed a lack of respect for other big teams, and  he needs to be put into his place.

true,jvdbization,lfc68,,"I don't recall hearing of Tottenham's interest in Konoplyanka during our heavy pursuit of Salah.  Only after we made our move have they expressed real interest in the player.  So if the direction of our transfer priorities so heavily sways their actions, whether or not they've been looking at the player, it backs my claim that they make an asserted effort to compete with us specifically, while having a more defeatist attitude when competing with their London rivals in the same market.   We're the biggest club they feel they can assert superiority over financially, especially since FSG's more modest and cautious approach since the Comolli/Dalglish signings.  

We're competing for the same ""pool of players"" worldwide, and there are other clubs throughout Europe with similar financial structure and needs to our own, yet Tottenham is, by great distance, our most common competitor for the players **within** that pool in which Rodgers feels fits his model and actually pursues.  Sure, it's a sound strategy, it makes sense for them to disrupt what we do while they can.  Their motivations in the market (specifically under Levy) have been much more than just acquiring players to address their needs.  It was blatant last summer that Levy did everything he could to prevent Arsenal from getting Ozil by prolonging the Bale negotiations.  And a similar drama seems to be unfolding with Arsenals pursuit of Draxler and Shalke's minuscule interest in Holtby.  It's not entirely sinister, as I said, it makes sense for them.  But their motives undeniably go beyond strengthening their own team, they want to prevent their direct rivals from strengthening as well whenever possible.  Their ""coincidental"" interest in an overwhelming majority of our major targets kills two birds with one stone.

true,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"The model is a smaller percentage take from a larger overall GDP.  It's the same principle people generally take away from the idea of the Laffer Curve, though in general that's a horribly misunderstood model.

In extremely simple terms it's a gamble that a business will choose to locate itself in a lower tax regime because it gets to keep a larger percentage of its profits.

Taxation is extremely complicated - The legislation is complicated enough, but the way things interact and trigger behaviour can be astoundingly complicated.  It's also an area where even the so-called experts are regularly as good as clueless.

The main reason I would suggest that the idea that lower tax rates will not lead to inward investment is the ease with which big businesses can avoid tax.  Take Starbucks for instance as a high-profile example.  Do you think Starbucks need to relocate to Scotland to pay a low rate of tax?

On top of this becoming a member of the EEC or the EU will come at a price in terms of restrictions the government of an independent Scotland would have to agree to.  As noted in this, entering into a monetary union with the remaining dregs of the UK would come at a price in restrictions.

The ultimate thing is that no one really knows how independence for Scotland would pan out.  Or staying with the UK, for that matter.  But no politician ever went to the polls under-promising.  Pretty much everything you get to see is a journalist's interpretation of a politician's sales pitch of something extremely complicated that he wants you to think he has a clear handle on.",0,1391049556,null,0,false,0,cf2d4h6,t3_1wgwx2,t1_cf2d4h6,t1_cf29xnq,null,1432168782,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Some great defenders can get away with it - Chiriches has, so has Dawson. Rose is not a great defender, and needs to realize that he can't be taking those absurd risks.

Rose fucked up. Maybe the ref did too, but Rose put himself in a bad situation with little likelihood of success. Stop blaming the ref and accept the truth: Rose made a judgment error, Spurs went down to 10 men against the 2nd best attacking team in the BPL, and as a result we lost. 

And the good news is that that's ok. Judgment can be taught. This isn't our 6-0 thrashing under AVB when it was readily apparent that AVB was completely incapable of dealing with the City attack. It was 1-0 when Rose made a mistake, and then we paid for it.

Wouldn't there be a provision in the contract with your electrician to document how the house is wired. If you didn't include that then you're an idiot (hypothetically speaking).

Also your analogy about someone coming in and doing some DIY is a bit off. I would say it's more like someone coming in and updating some wiring in a big office or factory than it is someone coming in to change a bulb in your house. 

Sure maybe they could change the bulbs or fix a fuse but updating the wiring is still probably the domain of an electrician and only the ones with the right experience and/or training would probably do a good job.",0,1391051240,null,0,false,0,cf2dwdd,t3_1wghfs,t1_cf2dwdd,t1_cf2bali,null,1432169187,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2
