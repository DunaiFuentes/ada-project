Well the difference between the Doctor and Adelaide are huge.  Adelaide is a human being, and at the end of the episode the time line corrects itself with her death.  Also for all we know that mashed up world happened, and they just didn't show it.

Yes the CD prefix is for Cardiff but that doesn't mean that foreign diplomatic cars don't use CD too. Although there *is* a specific system that cars owned by embassies *can* use (and we do ask them to if the car is staying for any length of time) but this is generally staff-cars etc. There's more than a good chance that the ambassador (or any other car at that) is not using the UK system.

Also - the average police / traffic wardens have absolutely no idea whether or not they are looking at a diplomat or accredited staff until they call it in. I've asked my police colleagues (in traffic) and it simply doesn't come up. If it were flagged as diplomatic on system when they ran a check, that's when they would find out (or if they were using ANR). This may not hold true for guys in the Met who have to deal with it more often but they are just as likely to see CD plates as they are the UK issued one.

While yes it may have weighed a little more towards the criticism it did show that gaming is a very normal and popular thing to do but it is not all good. 
The GTA argument while I do agree somewhat, does not fully back your point that violence in video games does not cause any real life behaviour. It doesn’t reward violent behaviour, but it does by definition allow you to commit those crimes and get away with it with enough work, which could suggest similar behaviours in real life (however only on a very small scale as the games are usually the release for violence and I also disagree that video game violence = real life violence)
&gt; Is it too much to ask for a wholly positive show about some of the best and greatest games with the most scope and depth or where the criticisms of gaming are laughed off with a decent argument against them?

To deny that any and every criticism has no merit is just dumb and to try and make an informative and rounded documentary as Charlie is one to do then It would be equally as dumb to not include any or just laugh off them all without even considering what each one may be suggesting.

My main point being that Charlie made a good documentary for the target audience he had and while it may not have been very good for people who already know about games it did inform how ‘video games changed the world’ which is exactly what the documentary set out to do. 

That doesn’t mean to say I thought it was perfect, I thought the #1 was kind of dumb [](/s ""Twitter may be some kind of social game but it certainly isn’t a video game in the way that the entire rest of the program defined them to be"") but overall the list was pretty sound. 

*I did have a much better argument written out* ***twice*** *but both times I clicked away accidentally and lost it all, this one was done on word so not to lose it, so there may be some holes as I wasn’t writing ‘in the heat of the moment’ per se*

false,NotanotherYank,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,"Perceived overpopulation is a systematic problem, with a technological solution. We could provide higher density habitation which provided food, energy, water and waste processing if we bothered to apply higher technical standards to the way we create our built environment.

In doing so we could potentially reduce the current footprint of our towns and cities, increasing the area available for the green belt, and increase our capacity for future population growth.

Our current economic model requires perpetual growth in a finite world, and encourages the wasteful application of finite resources (see mined and refined rare materials being reburied in landfill). The application of technology and careful resource management could provide a suitable habitat for a far greater human population than we currently have, with a higher standard of living. We are very far away from 'being full', it is just easier to suggest attempting to stop humans breeding than it is to actually attempt to evolve (in the technological sense).

You are correct in your assertion, I do like the challenge of overcoming our long term survival problems with the proper application of design, technology and the scientific method, it is vastly preferable to me than shipping 'foreigners' back to where they happened to be born and hoping the problems will go away, or attempting to limit the fundamental drive to reproduce most humans have.

FYI currently the birth rate is less than the ~2.1 replacement rate, were it not for immigration our population would be dropping, and slowly becoming more top heavy to the point of unsustainability. We need to encourage people to have for more babies and plan society accordingly.

As a British citizen by descent, you cannot pass on your citizenship to your daughter. If she can obtain Australian (or any commonwealth) citizenship, she could apply for a British ancestry visa that would allow her to work in the UK for 5 years. But again, it would be difficult to prove without your father's name on your birth certificate.

Then if you decide you don't want to work for crappy pay in the games industry you can go and make a pile of money working for someone else.

false,NapoleonHeckYes,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"It could be that we need to work harder on improving integration, rather than reducing immigration, but this hasn't featured prominently in any of the main parties' manifestos, despite the fact that it would directly benefit communities who feel that immigration has changed the character of where they live.  

It is fine to suggest we need to make sure immigration does not get out of control, but an ideological echo chamber has been created whereby false accusations from political parties or the media are bandied about and given the semblance of credibility. It doesn't mean the people are naive, it means they are rarely presented with clear and accurate facts, but rather confusing mixed messages of questionable veracity. 

In 2011, just over 10% of our population was foreign born, however these people are not evenly distributed - many people will have had experience with foreigners but usually concentrated in certain areas, and few of these 10% are criminals. Over a million of these are from Western or Commonwealth countries with close ties to British culture.

Most of the country is not by any means flooded by foreigners. Still, in London, an area with a lot of immigration, UKIP has previously won no seats at the London Assembly. Not even one. A lot of people with foreign backgrounds may have voted here, but if the 'problem' with immigration was so clear from Londoners' personal experience, wouldn't they have got at least ONE seat?

Could it be that even areas which have not been greatly affected by immigration are on the anti-immigrant bandwagon, despite there being few immigrants and even fewer criminal ones? This would suggest their views do not come from personal experience but rather what they have been told or learnt from newspapers (for example).

false,Delheru,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"&gt; By 2050, a lot of economists are believing that China will replace the USA as the dominant economic power. 

But this is complicated by the wording.

Power isn't just GDP, otherwise 100 people with 20,000 GBP per year income would have the political influence of one person with 2,000,000 GBP per year income. This isn't so.

Why not? Because the real issue is free cash flows. The poor people spend all their money on rent, food, childcare etc leaving each of those 100 people with 50 GBP per month on ""fun"", totaling 5,000 GBP per month for the lot or 60,000 GBP per year.

Meanwhile the 2,000,000 GBP person spends 10x more on his normal living, but that still amounts to only 10x  19400 GBP, leaving him with no less than 1.8m GBP to play around with.

Similar issue with China and India. Even if their total GDP reaches very high levels due to the population, there might not be that much surplus capital looking for interesting things to do. Now on top of this a lot of China's elite is very keen to invest abroad to keep money safe from a regime that can confiscate it all on a whim even today, which means that not only are their free cash flows far worse than the total GDP implies, but a huge chunk of that is not even being used in China but is coming abroad.

Now what WILL change is that a lot of very powerful Chinese tycoons will rise (and have already risen) and the global elite will have a significant chunk of Chinese citizens in it. That still won't make China a peer of Europe and US though.",0,1413838625,null,0,false,0,clexz4y,t3_2jscwb,t1_clexz4y,t1_cleq1l2,null,1426433702,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

I think the main problem is that the establishment/public in the UK has always seen Americans as family and the US like a lost dominion waiting to be reunited. So we saw/see the USA as [natural allies](http://www.britishempire.co.uk/media/punch/punchcolumbia.htm).

The opposite is not the same though. I would dare to say that there is still an anti-British/English element to the American identity. Even though she was built on and by British/English ideals, institutions, and people. Due to this continued notational creation myth of the evil English/British oppressors over the good American colonists. They view us with a ""mistrust"" and, when we had an Empire, something to dismantle and marginalise for their own good.

Though I do like Americans and the USA I do feel that we need to remind ourselves that the US only looks out for itself. Plus where possible move slightly away from them, e.g. not directly helping in their wars. We need leaders (I can't believe I'm going to type this) like Enoch Powell who will be distrustful of the USA.

I'm not sure what's in the terms and conditions, but if the phone EE have supplied her with is not fit for purpose, they should make every effort to sort it out. It looks like they _are_ doing, albeit in a roundabout and not particularly helpful way.

They basically promise to provide you with a mobile network, but if your equipment seems not to be working with it, tough shit.

You can cancel the contract with one month's notice, but they'll apply a cancellation charge which is probably going to be all the £38 charges for the remaining months of the contract.

In terms of his offense, I can't say much that hasn't already been said. He needs to be more energetic and run more into the box.

false,emptyhunter,cnty-expat,Expat m8,"&gt;In August, the British Embassy in Washington provoked a diplomatic upset by tweeting a picture of a cake surrounded by sparklers to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the burning of the White House by British troops. It was silly joke about an event that took place in 1814 but, even with the passage of two centuries, it was “too soon” for some Americans. The embassy had to apologise, proving that the humour gulf between our countries is wider than the Atlantic.

It was a slow news day and the people who mattered (i.e. the US government) took it as what it was: a joke. He's just like the idiots in America with regard to this event, making it a bigger deal than it ever actually was.

&gt;And it dawns on you that the Yanks would probably dump their number one ally in a New York minute if only they could persuade Germany to be a bit more servile.

That's why Germany has the same intelligence-sharing agreements with the US that we do... oh wait, they don't. They tried to negotiate it and were rebuffed.

&gt;As recently as the 1930s, the US had secret plans to attack Britain. These were aimed more at eliminating British influence (especially in Canada) than actual war with the UK, but even so. In the end, the Americans didn’t need to reduce our reach: World War II did this for them. Nonetheless, they played a cynical blinder with the Lend-Lease programme which was a disgusting piece of asset stripping in the guise of aid to nations that had no choice.

No source provided for the first bombshell claim. It could very well be true, but he hasn't demonstrated that it is. Lend-Lease was hardly asset stripping. The US government, *while still officially neutral* adopted a policy in which they sent the UK vital wartime supplies and equipment with the proviso that they get paid after the war. Without this program we wouldn't have stood a chance. You know how we get really annoyed with the French when they try and brush aside the fact that we liberated them in World War 2? Ask yourselves whether what Proud is doing here is any different. 

&gt;Post war, our great mates shut down nuclear weapons intelligence sharing, forcing us to develop our own hydrogen bomb. Simultaneously, they pursued policies which, in the event of World War III, would resulted in the UK being incinerated. The US, meanwhile, would have escaped pretty lightly because, at the time, Russian missiles were capable of hitting US airbases in Britain, but not North America.

The Americans did do the first bit. They changed their minds afterward and started to share information after we developed our own hydrogen bomb. The idea that America was using Britain as a human shield is completely ridiculous, we were part of a military alliance - of course we would get hit if war were to break out. As would the United States - Soviet missiles might have struggled to fly over the atlantic ocean, but they had no problem reaching the states by flying over Canada and the arctic. If World War 3 broke out, we would have all been dead. 

&gt;More recently, we slavishly supported the horrific, ill-advised policies of Bush in Iraq. From receiving no top level reconstruction contracts to being openly mocked by US Generals the moment we didn’t do as we were told, our loyalty gained us nothing. In retrospect, the French got it exactly right. Iraq and Afghanistan have cost the UK £30 billion (and around 600 lives) and are widely regarded as strategic failures. In the final analysis, being called a “cheese eating surrender monkey” by some bozo on Fox News looks pretty good.

You could make the argument that the UK was a very willing partner and contemplated deposing Saddam well before the Americans announced ther intention to do so. [Here's Tony Blair talking about the danger Saddam poses to the international community in 1999. Well before Bush was elected.](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/international-jan-june99-blair_doctrine4-23/)

&gt;Of course, our unthinking and self-sabotaging subservience to the US doesn’t end in the bloody sands of the Middle East. From our extradition treaties to our nuclear deterrent to our business practices, no “ask” is too big or small for Uncle Sam.

Our extradition arrangements with the US are far too lenient and need to be looked at again, but the US doesn't dictate our business practices in any sense of the term. We share a common ideology in that sphere.

&gt;Our drugs policy is America lite. Rather than upset the US government, we pursue a policy which has been proven not to work. 

This is a new one. I've never ever heard the argument that the UK's drug policy is beholden to that of the US. He hasn't presented any evidence that it is, either.

I'm going to leave it there. The Telegraph should really have higher standards - this article is complete and utter nonsense. Digital detritus.

false,GreyShuck,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"For a start off, I think that there are different categories of Fixed Points, and each category may have very different consequences if they are altered, or an attempt is made to alter them.  

I think that we can distinguish ""personal"" Fixed Points (such as Rose's dad), which are fixed in the sense that the person(s) in a position to alter them has already experienced their immediate consequences. Alteration of these results in localised paradoxes, and can ultimately be healed/resolved (by Reapers, where Time Lords or other more subtle intervening agencies are not present) or will form a self contained time loop or something.  

Then there are ""Universal"" Fixed Points, which are major events in the history of the universe and would have cascading consequences for other fixed points if changed. For example, However ""Fixed"" *Waters of Mars* was, if some previous threat to Earth had resulted in it being destroyed, it would hardly pop back into existence simply so that this could happen. 

I tend to think of these Universal Fixed Points in the context of the ""big ball of wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey"" model. For simplicity, let's drop a dimension (or 9) and think of a circular board covered with fixed, magnetic pegs. Loads of wibbly-wobbly rubber bands, also with magnets on their ends, are stretched between pairs of these pegs, criss-crossing all over the place, but with certain colours of bands only able to attach to certain colours (or polarities or whatever) of pegs, and a limited number of bands able to attach to each peg and with the bands only able to stretch so far, etc etc.  

Put sideways pressure or one of these bands, and it will hold for a while (and sort itself out again when you remove the pressure), but with enough pressure the magnet will jump away from the fixed point at one end. Maybe that end will snap to a free spot on a suitable, nearby peg. Maybe, in doing so, it might cause one or more other bands to snap away from that peg, (due to similar polarities etc), meaning that they would need to find new pegs themselves, and so on and so on.

In short, the various timelines MAY be able to form a new, stable combination, with a new set of ""active"" Fixed Points, but it maybe that one or more of the wibbly-wobblies will NOT find another point to attach to, and with a loose end, the Apocalyptic Whoniversal Kitten of Doom will be attracted and soon unravel the entire ball of timey-wimey.  

I rather think that there are other categories of Fixed Point too, but have grown bored with typing now.",0,1413841699,null,0,false,0,clezmrj,t3_2jtemn,t1_clezmrj,t3_2jtemn,null,1426432929,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

Some people are openly racist. They're a very small minority in the UK these days in the grand scheme of things. We have come a very long way as a country. We're also far less sexist - we still have a way to go, but we have made massive progress. Chinese people can't really vote so that's by the by, but I don't see how we vote for ""ultraconservative"" policies. The Tories can be called many things, but their policies are not ""ultraconservative"" in any true sense of the term.

&gt;Spitting in the street, flicking cigarette butts on the floor.

This happens. Spitting is pretty rare here but it's very common in Mainland China. Not going to dispute the cigarette butt comment.

&gt;Heckling in theaters, kids throwing popcorn in cinemas, texting in theatre.

I've never experienced heckling and I think i've seen kids throw popcorn once in my entire life. Not a big deal. I don't much care if people text as long as their phone is on silent. What business is it of mine?

&gt;General lack of care for the environment, fracking.

Don't be ridiculous. Britain's environmental problems pale in insignificance to the issues China is facing right now - they're a developing nation. Our rivers aren't black with coal dust, and we don't have cities where it's dangerous to breathe the air (at least not anymore). 

&gt;Third most popular party in the UK is dangerously nationalistic, and the Scots want to leave to become their own nation.

UKIP are still a minor force, and I have yet to see mobs of British people smashing up French pastry shops. Or curryhouses. Scotland voted to remain part of the United Kingdom, and did so pretty decisively, all things considered. 

&gt;We keep shitting on the middle east and fly drones over other people's sovereign territory to kill people extrajudicially.

The UK doesn't fly drones. The US does. And yes, it does kill people extrajudicially. But it does so with the permission of the governments of those countries (most of the time). Extrajudicial killings are not justifiable in any way.

I do agree with the rest of what you said. lovren's reading of the game has been poor. He is making wrong choices as well(like when to head clear vs, when to chest it to a teammate).

You just seem to dislike and I understand that but to say he's not top class is delusional. I hate RVP, but he's world class.

&gt;The __Cloister Bell__ was an alarm bell located in the Cloister Room inside TARDISes. [__source__ needed] The Cloister Bell was used in the most serious of emergencies, which saw either the TARDIS or its inhabitants in danger. 
&gt;Its distinctive, sonorous, ringing sound resembled that of a large church bell. It could be answered by anyone inside the TARDIS. The Fourth Doctor told Adric that if he needed him, Adric could sound the Cloister Bell, indicating it could be manually activated. (TV: *Logopolis*)

We need to work harder on improving integration AND we better control on the numbers. Having the **power** to control immigration can only be a good thing. How we use it is up to the British public.

I find it hard to believe that anyone can think that unlimited immigration year on year can be a good thing. So where do you draw the line. It was over 200,000 last year, what about 500,000? 1 million? And how do you come up with your preferred figure? 

&gt;It doesn't mean the people are naive, it means they are rarely presented with clear and accurate facts, but rather confusing mixed messages of questionable veracity. 

I agree that people are rarely presented with all the facts. You yourself have made several statements of fact without any evidence to support them.

&gt;A lot of people with foreign backgrounds may have voted here, but if the 'problem' with immigration was so clear from Londoners' personal experience, wouldn't they have got at least ONE seat?

It's well know that white British people, the group most likely to vote UKIP are now a minority in London. The number of white British has fallen dramatically in every borough of London, as can be seen [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21511904). There is not a single borough in London where the white British population is rising. 

I think these facts make it very obvious why UKIP has had no success in London. 

And by the way, in case you are trying to imply that UKIP haven't had any success because living side by side melts away any ill feeling towards each other, speaking as someone who lives and works in London, I can tell you there is still plenty of racism around.

This is a professional sport. It is played and managed by millionaires and owned by billionaires. There are no moral victories. Getting points from the result is everything. If you only want positive comments from me when QPR loses on a regular basis it ain't gonna happen. 

I am an overseas supporter. If QPR gets relegated I am back to watching bullshit extended highlights on QPR player for 4.99 a month and catching them on the occasional Sky Sports match from some crappy ass Internet stream. QPR doesn't even replay the whole game on QPR player like Derby and other clubs do. All of this makes following the them very difficult if they wind up back in the Football League. Therefore avoiding relegation means quite a lot to me and it pisses me off when they lose.

Three separate Japanese PMs have apologised for it (in 1972, 1995 and 2001) and the Japanese government has apologised on many other occasions. The Chinese government has consistently found these apologies to inadequate or insincere, which is their prerogative but apologies have definitely been made. 

Now there have also been other Japanese leaders and senior figures who are much less apologetic, including current PM Shinzo Abe, who provide China and other victims of Japanese actions during WW2 with legitimate reasons to be very angry with Japan. There are some truly awful people and beliefs in Japan but Chinese claims that Japan has never apologised or attempted to make right the actions of Imperial Japan are false.

2)From papers I've read about UK university policy for accommodating foreign students at UK universities and anecdotes from HE staff, cheating is a serious problem with Chinese students. 

Apparently they also are extremely reluctant to share their work in tutorials and seminars, hoping to take everyone else's good ideas but hold onto their own. This is a problem because one of the main aims of getting students to share their own ideas is to identify mistakes in their thinking and help them improve.

**Name of product:** L'Oreal Skin Perfection Miracle Cleansing Oil 

**Price of product:** £7.99 for 150ml

**Where did you purchase:** Boots! But it is seriously everywhere.

**Product claims:** *“Instantly dissolves even waterproof make-up, skin feels perfectly clean with a non-greasy finish. The oil formula helps to re-balance skin’s natural oil production for healthy-looking skin.”*

**About you:** Oily, closed comedone prone skin. Daily acid (AHA/BHA) user. So far I know I'm sensitive to niacinamide, but so far nothing else!

**Your opinion:** I absolutely love it! This is my third bottle and I can't see myself buying or using any other oil cleanser. It's essentially mineral oil, with an emulsifier and perfume.

The first four can all play as a leading striker or in a strike partnership role (can not wait to see the link up play between Pelle and J-Rod, could be lethal) and all of them but Pelle can take up a wide role to assist the front man. As for our midfield We've got Cork, Davis, JWP, Wanyama, Schneiderlin, and Reed, those first three can play jsut about anywhere in midfield and the way thuis seasons been going even our DMs are getting forward so that midfield is unpredictable as to who will play where.

Essentially our front 6 could line up one week with


Tadic - Pelle - Mane

Davis - Scheiderlin - JWP

Mayuka - Long - J-Rod

&gt;I might just be too optimistic though...

You might. If you don't know how your funds work then you might be in for some surprises. The markets have been rising steadily since 2011 so any share or fund will have done well. I recommend you learn about asset classes, bond vs shares specifically and work out how rebalancing a portfolio is done. Right now you sound like a fund managers dream and they always need a new Porsche.


&gt;Well, as putting the money in cash alternative gives me nothing the options are rather bleak... 

Keeping some money as cash gives you options. Specifically the option not to shit your pants when the markets dive (treat it like the sales, get the bargains), the option not to have to sell your investments at the worst time (redundancies often happen at the same time the markets dip) and best of all the option to stay out of debt when something breaks.


&gt;hopefully that would be enough ?

All down to you to work out mate. You have had three years of good times and you worried at the first sign of a dip. Maybe your appetite for risk is not as high as you think. High returns mean high risk, cash gets bugger all but has its uses and there are plenty of ways to to play the middle.

I'm also to begin lecturing Foundation students who will go on to study Games Programming at Bachelor level, at DMU, come January. Both me and my housemate studied AI and Robotics at DMU and got our work lecturing there via contacts.

DMU's a very good university for computer science, at least in certain areas. The courses can start off basic (The first week of my first year lectures had me fearing I'd chosen the wrong uni when people put up hands to ""hands up if you've never touched a keyboard before"" - but you'll find those are the people that drop out) but right from the start of the course there are ample opportunities to make of your time there what you will. Again, can't speak for games programming specifically since I didn't study it, but the centre for computational intelligence (which has a fair amount of overlap with games programming) has some of the greatest minds in the world on the subject of CI working there, who are more than willing to take your education as far as you want to go with it so long as you take the initiative to talk to them. I imagine that's the same with most lecturers in most faculties in most universities, but again I can only vouch for what I've experienced.

As for whether you should study Games Programming - as others have said, it can close doors. Then again, it's only the title of your degree. You don't even need a degree if you have experience or a portfolio, most hitech SMEs are run by young, modern-minded individuals who grew up and got jobs without needing a degree, and they'll pass the benefit of the doubt on to anyone willing to demonstrate the same thing. What's more, degrees are quite freeform, and you can quite easily find employment if your final year project is outstanding, regardless of the university or grade of your degree. Personally, I wouldn't opt for straight up computer science as the title of a degree, as it's quite generic. You'll find that in any given subdiscipline of computer science, about 75% of modules overlap with other degrees such as software engineering, artificial intelligence, etc. whereas those other titles might be the thing that stand out to an employer with all-else-equal candidates.

Do you need to be in favour of everything? I can see working class people believing in the principle of not taxing somebody just for dying. Is lowering the top rate tax necessarily a bad thing?

You make this assertion, could you back it up? You say it's the root of all our problems in the first paragraph but never mention it again. 

&gt;These Tory scum are screwing us blind and there is nothing being done about it

In what sense? Unemployment is falling, the economy is the fastest growing in the G7.. what would you do differently?

&gt;British politics needs a complete reshuffle

You might say UKIP is a part of that.

&gt;politics should be a mandatory subject up until GCSE.

Do you really think so? I think History, taught properly, can give a decent understanding of politics. I'm not sure what teaching politics would help with, but, maybe. I think this is probably the best point you made.

&gt;theyre further right than the Conservatives

This is a classical mistake. You appear to be using the left/right paradigm as part of your reasoning why a group shouldn't vote for a party. The left/right paradigm is for *describing* a political alignment, but it's far too simplistic to be a meaningful decision-making tool. If you take one thing from this post, please make it that.

You are also assuming that the working class can't be right-wing. I know the current Tory leader is a rich son of a stock broker, went to Eton, is literally related to the Queen, etc. But the Tory party is broader than that - it might not be born from the Trade Unionist movement, but it's far from a rich-only club.

&gt;they don't know about UKIPs other policies

Are you thinking of anything specific, outside of getting rid of inheritance tax and general lowering of taxes (for example, taking people on the minimum wage out of income tax altogether; national insurance, etc...).

&gt;it seems their main policy that everyone talks about(immigration) is popular among the working class and they vote for them because of this without knowing any better.

Immigration is a hot issue. It's not one I particularly care for, but if some working class people have a real concerns about immigration, shouldn't they vote for a party that represents that concern? You say the working class don't know better... don't you find that a bit patronizing? You don't give the impression of knowing all that much either, frankly. No offence, if you're willing to learn.

Nor are you viewed as such by any Americans that I know. None of this is meant to be patronizing. It is a sincere and honest perception of Britain from the viewpoint of one American (and I really don't think I'm alone on this):

-Casts a very long shadow politically and diplomatically: Britain is not only a powerful nation independent of any other entity, but what Britain thinks and how she proceeds carries a great deal of weight in the US, the EU and the world over. From the perspective of this American, you are one of the strongest, most respected democracies on the planet, a true ally and deeply respected partner. And I'm not taking an overly-complimentary position for the sake of this post...we truly respect the hell out of you. 

-One of the most powerful center's of financial gravity in the world: I would suggest that London is more important to global finance than even Wall Street. Britain is uniquely poised to broker relationships with the US, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. For everything that is right and wrong with global finance these days, London, and Britain as a whole, are critically important to the continuity of global commerce and financial services. 

-Culture: You may disdain American culture but we tend to revere yours. Just a few scant examples: Peep Show, The Young Ones, The Office, Trainspotting, literature and music, music, music. If you think American culture has far reach, just take a good look at yourselves. Britain is a powerhouse of some of the best literature and music on the planet. Countless Americans are raised to revere The Beatles, Led Zepplin and The Rolling Stones. They continue to have 'best band ever' status with people all over the world. And literature? Every American student is drilled on the English greats and it represents an important part of our basic education. A true affection and interest in British cultural output has been retained by a lot of Americans and your continued artistic influence over all English-speaking cultures cannot be understated. I don't know how else to say it but we like you at 'Hello' and tend to have a prounounced respect for your culture. 

Sorry if this seems flowery or over-blown but sometimes I read the posts of British folks and there are times when they don't seem to understand their own political or cutlural importance from the perspective of outsiders. 

EDIT: The Kinks, Pink Floyd, The Clash, The Underworld, The Sex Pistols, The Cure, The Smiths (we know you hate Morrissey, but piss off, we all like something from 'Meat is Murder', even if you won't admit it, Americans will).

false,rainbowscooter,null,null,"I kind of used to think like this too. I was doing fine and saving some a month, no huge expenditures. 
But I recently started actively monitoring my spending and I was a bit shocked by how much I was spending on some things - there was a lot of waste going on, not to mention spending on things that I thought were worthwhile in small chunks, but once added together were pretty shocking amounts. Like buying 6 bargain clothing items @ £20 = £120. 
I realised that I could be saving quite a bit more a month just by being a bit more aware of what I spent and actively budgeting. 
For example, I have managed to cut £150 off our (SO and I) monthly food shopping spend without actually buying anything that different, have saved around £50 a month by buying work-related train tickets in advance (I'm freelance so can't claim these back apart from against my tax bill), and have rearranged our banking so that we don't pay any unnecessary charges and get good interest rates. I switched broadband and energy providers which has saved us jointly around £700 a year. 
It's early days yet but this is going to seriously boost our savings rate and allow us to pay off small stray debts that have been lingering for years, painlessly.
Investing is great, but I honestly can't recommend the satisfaction of spending less and being conscious that you're not wasting money, enough. 

I have been particularly inspired by a few websites/blogs, I'm a long-time lover of Martin Lewis money saving expert, and just discovered a blogger called Mr Money Mustache, who is really the one who has inspired my spending-less attitude - if you read about his saving philosophy you'll see why, one of his posts said something along the lines of 'if you cut back on your daily starbucks and cable tv, you could retire 8 years earlier'... that makes you stop and think, eh?!
I'm not an affiliate of either of these - just wanted to recommend them whole-heartedly as a wake-up call to how much more I could save and hammering home why it was important. Investment-wise, the sooner you invest cash, the sooner you get interest on it - so the less you spend, the higher your investment returns are. 
I thought I was living pretty frugally and saving plenty too, but those small odds and ends add up. ",0,1413850899,null,0,false,0,clf44nq,t3_2jpn09,t1_clf44nq,t3_2jpn09,null,1426430760,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3

You might not be that bothered about renting but consider that one of the best returns on investment in the future might be a buy-to-let property and also the fact that you can't get a buy to let mortgage on your first property. If you want to build up wealth then buying property to rent can be a really good option. Not for everyone but it's worth considering.

Digital forensics is not a speedy process. First you need to take images of any and all disks (in order to perform forensic operations without disturbing the original copy of the evidence). That takes a few hours on its own. You can then perform preliminary scans of common cache and history files quite quickly, but then you probably want to scan the free space in the drive for deleted files, which takes hours too.

Then there might be encrypted files, encrypted volumes, protected archive files, virtual machines, evidence of self-contained applications on removable drives to avoid caching on their main drive, they could also be running an open wireless access point - because if they get caught downloading material from a honeypot or via network monitoring on their ISP, they can then claim that it wasn't them, for which you'll need to investigate evidence of the contrary - and all kinds of methods to try and generate plausible deniability in regards to evidence and hide their tracks. Every one of these can take serious time to perform properly, and you definitely want to do it properly: If you break the chain of evidence in any way, you possibly lose any chance of a firm conviction. There's no cutting corners in a forensic investigation.

Now, people who spend so much time and effort covering their tracks obviously raise an eyebrow of suspicion, and while these are almost certainly the people you *should* be investigating, their evasion methods are going to be the ones that take up the majority of your time. If your lab is backed up with a storeroom full of the computers of every person who was found to have downloaded a single file, then you either deal with a constantly building backlog, all the while actual child abusers may be allowed to continue, or you have to start funding external contractors to aid in investigation; which detracts from your overall budget and is a major drain on your resources for the purpose of basic forensic investigation - you really want to save these resources for times when you need contractors who offer specialist forensic services that you may not be provide internally.

Here's hoping they come up with a sensible process for selecting the most likely cases. Best of luck to them.",0,1413854454,null,0,false,0,clf5u6w,t3_2jsl5m,t1_clf5u6w,t1_clesq0w,null,1426429963,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

In this usage it retains the historical connotation of ""outside the bounds of normal society"" and can be construed as ""breaking the rules for sex and gender"". It can be preferred because of its ambiguity, which allows queer-identifying people to avoid the sometimes strict boundaries that surround other labels.

Sturridge had a point to prove after being benched by Chelsea and being used as a sub although the talent was clearly there.

But there are 2 extremely elite big money teams in the EPL (Man City and Chelski were HUGE favorites coming into this season) who will almost surely finish 1-2. After that there is the big money team on a hangover from losing a pantheon manager (Man U), and not quite as big but still big money teams looking to hang in there and nick a trophy here and there (Liverpool, Arsenal), and second tier teams who are always pretty good but not great (Everton, Spurs).

Those 7 will almost certainly finish in the top 7 places in the league. This isnt the NFL. Wages and transfer spending are based on revenue, not a salary cap. Big teams stay big (with few exceptions) and smaller teams fight over the scraps.

UK and Canada also had plans to secretly attack US. It's what bored military advisers do, plan for everything ...

&gt; Nonetheless, they played a cynical blinder with the Lend-Lease programme which was a disgusting piece of asset stripping in the guise of aid to nations that had no choice.

On the other hand the UK got the most money of all European nations from the Marshal Plan.

OK well yeah was a bit of a sore issue *some* naive Americans helped fund at one point.

You know, this is beginning to feel a bit like a pisstake. I get up and do a facial wash. I put two layers of moisturiser on. Apply foundation. Apply primer, pressed powder and eyeshadow. And now I have to apply this milk stuff to make my shadows look the colour they are in the palette? WHY FFS?

I'm after some matte greys and blacks, but [none of these](http://www.reddit.com/r/MakeUpAddictionUK/comments/2iaef2/greys_and_blacks_eye_palette_with_some_mattes_in/) are any good. Thoughts? 

&gt;So I own a lot of eyeshadow, then? I didn't think I owned a lot...

You do have quite a few yes! I don't have patience for huge palettes; they're a pain the the arse to store. I've got another half or dozen or so stashed in the cupboard that I haven't decided whether to sell or keep yet. If eBay and PayPal keep pissing me around and not paying me, it looks like they'll be miiiiiine :)

&gt;I tried out a couple of the Makeup Revolution shadows

Oooh, nice, I like that a lot. Do you put a little bit of white in your inner eye? What's that meant to do? I think I'm going to mess around a bit with Eyes Like Angels today. 

&gt;Eyeshadows never last properly on me for an entire day, but they did no worse than most. I am impressed!

Really? That's annoying. They do seem to for me; maybe we have different shape eyelids or something. And I'm still using a cheap £1 MUA primer at the moment. 

Have you experimented with indie makeup at all?

For example, [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/2j08fn/according_to_a_survey_i_read_about_recently_9_of/cl7ow8q). 

 What starts off as being gig buddies inevitably turns into friendship = get invited to parties, picnics and lots and lots of other stuff. It feels a bit incestous at times because we all bloody know one another and everyone seems to be in everyone else's band! But natural sub-groups also seem to form for those with different interests too, i.e. those who juut want to get trollied, and those who want to get up to a bit more as a group. Also, there's none of this 'this person can only be my friend' kind of shit. I met a fella through a gig buddy a few years ago in the pub when said fella was down in London and gathered a group of us together; got on well with this one chap who I now have on Facebook, and he invites me to various events including but not restricted to his annual re-visit to the Best Kebab I've Ever Had In London, which is just an excuse to get a bunch of people together, drink, eat and party. I've only met him once.

Would highly recommend looking for some gig buddies in your area to get this ball rolling. I have 13 invitations outstanding on FB at the mo, all of which are through gig/music mates and/or their friends. 

Otherwise you know what I generally do with my evenings: watch films, post shit on Reddit, and, increasingly frequently, chat and/or Skype various Red Lioners (and some real life friends - I do have them, honest guv). I need to pick my book back up/make attempts to draw/paint stuffs soon, as I feel I have a creative urge welling up that I really really to need to get out right now (and frankly staring at the shit artwork in the house I'm living in at the moment is doing my nut in - I want to make something better!).",0,1413875386,null,0,1413876487,0,clfdt45,t3_2jt06e,t1_clfdt45,t3_2jt06e,null,1426426185,1,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,1

I honestly see some of 4 in 12 because of that insensitivity and lack of emotional awareness that they both appear to have. Both have had moments where they showed they care, but both are more dismissive and lacking in visible empathy than many of the other Doctors. Both have a truly alien feeling compared to the other Doctors.

There are also numerous parallels between the two incarnations, a dislike of those who they deem stupid, getting quite upset over such things in both incarnations. When taking a leadership role they both become rather callous with their egos coming into play. Both are playing this sort of father figure role to their companion.

Both 4 and 12 show some of the Darkest aspects of the Doctor's personality. Perhaps I'm seeing things that aren't really there but to me they both seem so similar to each other. I could honestly see Capaldi going through the entire series behaving in a similar way to how Tom Baker does.

I slightly disagree with 11 not having anyone to criticize him, there are quite a few moments where the Doctor goes off the deeper end and he's criticized heavily for it. For example Amy during the Wild West episode where she basically calls him out on his crap. Pointing out that when he travels alone he becomes a darker more callous person.

As for being manipulative, I honestly kind of feel like that's just how the Doctor is. You see it less in Ecleston and Tenant from what I can recall, you see it heavily with 11, but you can also see it heavily in the Classic Doctors as well.

false,rubygeek,null,null,"&gt; There isn't enough space in the big cities.

There are places with **far** higher population density than British cities. the core of London for example is still at a density that'd be considered pretty much suburban many other places. 

There are plenty of places in London where the population density can be upped dramatically without big problems. Consider Croydon, for example, where most of the town centre is gradually being replaced by highrises (a 44 floor residential building under completion 4-5 of near the same size or higher have planning consent, along with a dozen or so building in the 14-30 story height). No green spaces being replaced, rather ugly post-war concrete office buildings and brownfield sites.  

Greater London alone is expected to handle a rise of about a million in the next 6-8 years, thus eating up about half the total rise. Furthermore, the *majority* of the rise in London is expected to come in the form of increased density in the inner boroughs and town centres, so the actual area most affected is tiny. 

&gt; how long do you think we can carry on taking in 250,000 extra people every year?

For decades, easily. And it'll be *needed*, because an increasing proportion of the post-war population bulge is entering pension age.

The rise is furthermore there for one reason and one reason only: People manage to get jobs. In other words: Most of them are needed.  Unemployment is low enough in the UK that if any sizeable fraction of immigrants left the UK, the country would be severely fucked - the number of immigrants in the UK is several times the total unemployment. Millions of jobs would remain unfilled for lack of people. Businesses would collapse or move abroad, and the economy would massively contract. 

&gt; The countryside would be ruined because labour and their ilk would brick it over to building housing estates.

Interestingly, according to media they made it clear at the Labour conference that one of their priorities was to reintroduce a ""brownfield first"" policy. A claim that's directly at odds with yours.

&gt; They are so fanatically devoted to the doctrine of multiculturalism and mass immigration, and they hate themselves and Britain so much (as we can see by them turning a blind eye to the rape of 1400 British children and the subsequent coverup), that they will gladly destroy the countryside if it means they get a few more million life long labour voters, which immigrants overwhelmingly are.

Who do you think sounds most fanatic after a paragraph like that? You or them?

false,JorgeSalama,null,null,"&gt;There are places with far higher population density than British cities. the core of London for example is still at a density that'd be considered pretty much suburban many other places.

So? I don't want to live somewhere like Delhi or Beijing. I know London is less populated than some places but I don't see why that is an argument for allowing it to become more so. It is already bad as it is. I don't see how the existence of more densely populated areas means we should just allow London to become like that.

&gt; For decades, easily. And it'll be needed, because the post-war population bulge is starting to enter pension age

If immigration is NEEDED, then we can have a work permit system, can't we? We can look at our society, see where we need workers, and then let the appropriate people in. 

There's absolutely no need for an open door immigration policy, even if you are correct. And besides, what happens when these decades are up? 

Also I don't think you are correct. With certain targeted policies to encourage/discourage people to have birth (based on what our reproduction levels are at at the time), we can perpetually keep the population around 65 million, with an upper limit of about 80 or 90 million as our life expectancy rises due to scientific breakthroughs. As the average life expectancy increases, it is true that people will receive pensions for longer, but the overlooked facet of that argument is that due to the fact people are in better health, they will be able to work for longer. If the average age rises to 120 over the next 60 or 70 years due to life prolonging medication or operations, then it would be silly to have a retirement age of 60. 

For the transition period where there is a big pension bill but we still have the same retirement age, we will have to decide whether we want to raise the retirement age, or increase taxes. 

None of this requires mass immigration, and it is a lie to say so. By importing people to solve this problem, you are just kicking the can down the road and engaging in the creation of a ponzi scheme. What happens when in 100 years the UK is as densely populated as Mumbai and we can't actually take in any more immigrants? The whole thing would collapse.

The difference between our approaches is that I am actually thinking ahead 100 years and thinking about how we can have a sustainable society, whereas you seem to think that we can just carry on growing our population and by the time shit hits the fan and we're an overpopulated mess, you'll be long dead anyway and none of this will matter.

Just think ahead. Think about the reality of what you are proposing. You say that to pay for pensioners, we have to have an ever increasing amount of migration. Well, answer me this. What exactly happens when we can no longer physically take in more migrants, or have the physical space to provide them with public services?

That is the future that we will face if we follow a course of action like that. The only sensible option here is what I am advocating. Economic measures designed to keep the population around 65 million, with an upper limit of 80 or 90 million. If we do it right, by the time life expectancy is high enough that our population is bound to increase, we will most likely be at the point of colonizing other planets then, which will free up more space. No, I am not joking. That will almost certainly happen at some point, and if it doesn't, I'm not sure how we're going to deal with the ever growing population.

&gt;Unemployment is low enough in the UK that if any sizeable fraction of immigrants left the UK, the country would be severely fucked - the number of immigrants in the UK is several times the total unemployment. 

Why are you inventing some bizarre situation where all the immigrants are kicked out of the country? The UK being a first world nation, there is a huge demand to come here from all across the globe. If we do genuinely need migrants, there will be more than enough who apply to come here.

&gt;Interestingly, according to media they made it clear at the Labour conference that one of their priorities was to reintroduce a ""brownfield first"" policy. A claim that's directly at odds with yours.

Yes, the policy is brownfield **first**. [After that they plan to build on green belt land.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/greenpolitics/planning/11169967/Revealed-Labour-plans-to-build-on-the-Green-Belt-if-it-wins-election.html)

Ultimately I have to ask you, where does this end? Let's say we get what you want and all the brownfield sites are built over, and maybe some green belt sites that have little environmental value.. Let's say we build these huge tower blocks that you want, and we keep perpetually importing more migrants to the point that we are as densely populated as Mumbai.... is that it? Does it end there? Do you then say ""this is enough, we can't go any further"".

I have to be honest when I tell you that it really doesn't seem that you have thought this through at all. I hate to have to say it but it appears that you are happy to turn the UK into an overpopulated mess (the inevitable end result of infinite migration), and then leave the clean up to your children.

&gt;Who do you think sounds most fanatic after a paragraph like that? You or them?

Clearly Labour are the fanatics. It is a case of fact that immigrants overwhelmingly vote labour and it also a case of fact that under new labour they actually sent out search parties to round up families of immigrants to bring them here, knowing that they'd have their electoral support. This was all detailed by new labour's former speech writer Andrew Neather.

It is also a case of fact that labour councils and police commissioners turned a blind eye to the industrial scale rape of 1400 white children who were targeted specifically by Kashmiri Pakistani muslims, for purposes of political correctness. While they were doing this, it was also a labour council that decided to kidnap foster children from a perfectly respectable foster couple simply because they were UKIP supporters.

Because of all the goodwill he's generated, everyone whoops and cheers every time he does anything, but so far in eight Premier League games he's got 0 goals and 3 assists. He looks ok but that's it. If he were a young, untried player we'd spent £8m on then that would be fine, but we bought him for £30m as one of the best young players in the game. £30m should not buy you potential. £30m should buy you a player who is ready to take the league by storm. To put that into context it's more or less the same price that Chelsea paid for Diego Costa or Fabregas. I really hope he turns out to be a Spurs legend, but so far all we've seen are glimpses of potential.

Because he's Argentine, was signed from a glamour club and cost us £30m, everyone assumes that he's amazing and that it's only a matter of time before he turns into the next Bale.

I was reading an article in the New York Times a month or so ago that was describing this issue.  Most of the problems the Democrats are having with the Republicans are down to the fact that Obama refuses to engage with the Republicans.  Obama's own party has given up on him now due to his isolationism regarding party politics.  

Generally speaking, Obama has been the biggest political disappointment of modern times.  He came into office like a breath of fresh air, full of promises and new ideas.  But that breath of fresh air quickly turned out be a fart in an elevator.  Obama just wasn't ready for the job of President.  He wasn't the bridge that was needed to cover the gap between Democrats and Republicans.  This is a guy who won the Nobel Peace Prize but uses drones to kill innocent families in the Middle East.  Obama has turned out to be almost everything he promised he wouldn't during his campaign to be President.

I also agree with the belief that if it's on the streets it's not protected, it just isn't. If you want protected and curated art then do it on a canvas, if you want street-art then it will deteriorate and/or get dogged, it's just how it is and protecting one artist while buffing all others obviously has created a friction.

&gt;There have been 55 occasions when the UK voted against an EU measure in the Council of Ministers [...] how many times, out of those 55, we succeeded in blocking the measure? That’s right: zero. That literally is, to use Mr Barroso’s phrase, ‘zero influence’.

Indeed. And that's because Britain doesn't engage properly with the institutions of the EU. That the UK doesn't get its own way when we throw a tantrum isn't an indictment of the people who ignore our childish whining. We could have enormous influence, if we wanted it. But we'd have to act in an influential way.

You can send compromising photographs to a select group of people like employers, parents, colleagues, and the victim may never even know why they've been denied job promotion of treated differently. The damage has already been done, using law as means of redress if futile unless you argue it serves as a deterrent for future uploadings, which i'm not convinced it does. If someone is determined to share digitised media, there is no way to stop them. Technology and the internet cannot be policed by conventional means. Mass GCHQ spying and laws like this are reactive and imo futile attempts to mitigate big governments eroding ability govern their respective nation states.

The proposed law is, like the new trolling law, symptomatic of how the Daily Mail, lobby groups and pressure groups are now wielding a lot of power over the direction of our government. I know you generally get this anyway with coalition governments, but this conservative administration is especially weak, headed by a man with no real principles and no real vision and runs his ship on what his various 'advisers' tell him. Advisers who, desperate to be seen to be 'in tune with public opinion', all immerse themselves in social media and think what people say in comments sections is representative of public opinion. This is what you get when you have a government that 'listens to the people', it listens to those who shout the loudest.

Danger isn't an 'all-or-nothing' thing: There are degrees of risk depending on the activity and the circumstances surrounding it. Just because something's dangerous in some circumstances doesn't mean it's always dangerous all the time. Caffeine's dangerous if you drink too much but mildly stimulating if you drink 1 cup of coffee. You stand a greater chance of dying from riding a horse (if you're so inclined) than you do from smoking weed.

York Castle Museum is also worth a look, but is less about torture and execution and more about actual history.

If you're at all interested in trains then the National Railway Museum is a good bet too.

York's Chocolate Story is also, apparently, very good, although I've never visited it. York played a pretty significant role in chocolate manufacture throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, and this museum presumably tells the story.

All of the above are in the town centre, and within walking distance of the Minster.

Out of town attractions worth visiting: Yorkshire Air Museum, Eden Camp, Castle Howard or maybe a day trip to Whitby/the Yorkshire Dales if you have time.

They can get your credit report for you... that's the bulk of a credit reference agencies (CRA) income. Businesses getting credit reports of customers from CRAs.

&gt; What is it?

A credit report is a list of all your credit accounts and the state they're in. Also, a CRA will give an indication to lenders how likely they are to see their money back. Or in this case, how likely you are to pay rent.

Credit reports come in consumer form, or business to business (b2b) form.

The consumer form is for you to look at. It shows your current accounts, their state. Any late/outstanding payments. That sort of thing. It will also give a score. The score is your ""quality"" as someone to lend to. So a high score means you're a safe person to lend to. You'll get better rates etc. when you apply for credit.

The b2b report is often more tailored. It'll focus on loans/credit cards. It usually comes with a % score. This is ""how likely are you to get your money back"", to the business doing the loan.

In your case, the letting agency should be going direct to the CRA and getting the information themselves.

However, if you'd like to get things moving now. Go to [noddle](http://www.noddle.co.uk) and signup. It does ask for card details, but the product is free. The card details are one form of verification. The CRA (Callcredit in this case) already has your details somewhere on file.

Another option is to go to one of the CRAs

[callcredit](http://www.callcredit.co.uk/)  
[experian](http://www.experian.co.uk/)  
[equifax](http://www.equifax.co.uk/)

I'm not arguing that UKIP does not have the worst voting record, of course they do, THAT'S THE POINT.

That fact does not mean they do not represent the people who voted for them. It shows the opposite, that they are doing exactly what they were voted in to do. If UKIP had a good voting record, it would mean they were engaging and working with the EU, which gives it more legitimacy and power, which is the opposite of what they were elected to do. 

The only business interests UKIP is failing to protects are those that rely on the UK remaining part of the EU. Because that is what UKIP is campaigning for, its what they were elected to do. 

Its fine to disagree with what I am saying, but you are not disagreeing on any point of fact. You are simply misrepresenting the facts of the situation. 

It is extremely foolish to try and vilify UKIP by saying they have a low voting record, implying that they are somehow lazy.

Are they going to have a panel of experts to decide which feathered headdress is sufficiently non-native so that people can wear it?

EDIT: To counter my reactive statements, I'll add some constructive criticism. Instead of banning, I think they could have added a surcharge to every headdress and donated all monies to a Native American charity instead.

false,rubygeek,null,null,"&gt; I don't want to live somewhere like Delhi or Beijing. 

Delhi and Beijing only have about twice the density of London. Have you been there? I've not been to Delhi, but where Beijing feels cramped is not the high density areas, but the relatively low density low rise areas.

&gt;  I know London is less populated than some places but I don't see why that is an argument for allowing it to become more so. 

London will become more densely populated with or without immigrants, for the simple reason that people want to live here, and rising salaries for those who are already doing well enough to afford London creates a massive demand for more properties here. Want to change that? You'd need to re-introduce a far stricter planning system. Good luck getting people to agree to bureaucrats having even more power over planning.

&gt; If immigration is NEEDED, then we can have a work permit system, can't we? We can look at our society, see where we need workers, and then let the appropriate people in.

Which is what the UK *does have* for people outside of the EU. It is how the *majority* of the net migrants to the UK are allowed into the country.

As for people inside the EU: That's the cost of give and take. It would not alter the net migration much if the UK were to leave the EU, as the majority of net migration to the UK is by non-EU citizens, and a substantial proportion of British emigrants emigrate to EU countries, making the net migration between Britain and the EU fairly small. And while that is unrestricted, a fairly substantial amount of it is high skilled labour in areas where there's a strong demand.

&gt; Let's say we build these huge tower blocks that you want, and we keep perpetually importing more migrants to the point that we are as densely populated as Mumbai.... is that it? Does it end there? Do you then say ""this is enough, we can't go any further"".

It'd be *fantastic* if the big cities got to a population density that high. High density urban development is the *most environmentally friendly* and allows us to leave far more greenfield areas untouched. If London grew to the density of Mumbai, the entire current population could fit in London alone. 

Anyway, with 250,000 net migration a year, assuming no changes to birth pattern, nor deaths, and assuming the net migration would lead to 250,000 more people in London year on year, it'd take more than two centuries for London to reach that population density. In other words, you're being melodramatic.

And for my part, I'm not worried about whether that development comes here or elsewhere in the world. My yardstick for whether or not it is ""enough"" or too much is not absolute numbers, but whether or not it we are able to accommodate it. As it stands, the UK clearly is: The vast majority of immigrants are not immigrating to poverty and unemployment. The amount of immigrants is so much higher than unemployment that they are demonstrably contributing to expanding the overall economy.

With dropping crime rates, and dropping unemployment, despite the fact the coalition government utterly failed to meet their own stated goals of reducing immigration, I see no evidence that immigration present an objective problem.

It does present a *subjective* problem, in that we do need to accept that there is a substantial number of people who believe it is negatively affecting them. It doesn't really matter whether or not they're right - it does need to be addressed. But reducing immigration will not solve their grievances, just force them to find another scapegoat.

&gt; Clearly Labour are the fanatics. 

I'm not a labour support - I'm far too far to the left to find them sufficiently different from the Tories - or UKIP - to matter. But your ranting about them, and the way you're trying to tar the entire party based on things the vast majority of them did not know about, and had nothing t odo with, does make you seem far more fanatic than any Labour politician or supporter I've come across.

false,Herald_MJ,null,null,"I did this ride with some friends in February this year. 

My main tips:

* Don't do it in the middle of terrible storms. We rode for a miserable day to the ferry terminal in pouring rain, while having to deal with aggressive London-suburb traffic. It was really miserable, and when we eventually got to the ferry terminal, many ferries were cancelled due to weather, and so those that were left were super busy.

* When you arrive in France, you'll find the stretch between the coast and Paris to be largely devoid of any towns of a decent size, so it's a really good idea to carry a meals-worth of food with you, and to have addresses/phone numbers of accommodation candidates for each day with you.

* In France, everything closes on sundays. Even hotels. We had an absolute nightmare finding somewhere to stay late on a sunday evening. Things often have erratic opening hours on normal weekdays too. Perhaps this is less true during the holiday high season, but when we did the trip in February, finding even a simple café in medium-sized towns that were actually open on a weekday afternoon was sometimes a challenge.

* I guess I'd not spent much time outside of larger towns and cities in France before this trip, because for the first time in my life I came across French people working in service roles who didn't (or were unwilling to) speak English. The standard British attitude of ""everyone speaks English"" won't cut it, do brush up on your French. On our ride, we had a French-speaker along, and he saved our bacon on more than one occasion.

As for accommodation, we had some bad luck at first, but eventually stumbled across some really great places to stay.

* [Le Clos](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g3940403-d3594694-Reviews-Le_Clos-Fay_les_Etangs_Oise_Picardy.html) in a town called Fay-les-Étangs, about one day's ride from Paris was incredible. Beautiful accommodation, reasonably priced, and the kindest host we could have asked for. When we arrived here, the host kindly produced a massive delicious feast for us, complete with wine and cheese, and at almost no advance notice from us. Brilliant.

* Another place we stayed was a gîte (guest house) not far from Neufchâtel-en-Bray, but sadly I'm finding it difficult to come up with any information on the place from Google. I'll try again later and update this comment if I come across anything. Neufchâtel-en-Bray does also have some hotels, but all but one were closed on the sunday evening we arrived there (and the one that was open was fully booked).",0,1413893199,null,0,1413895952,0,clfha3d,t3_2jvg46,t1_clfha3d,t3_2jvg46,null,1426424494,5,false,londoncycling,t5_2wcdj,5

**Price of product:** £8.99 for 125 ml

**Products claims:** 

*Clear your skin of dirt, excessive oils and toxins which lead to breakouts with this Pore Purifying Clay Mask.*

*It contains Salicylic Acid proven to help unclog congested skin and oil-absorbing Dead Sea Mud rich in magnesium, calcium, potassium and iron for the perfect detox facial at home.*

*Avocado oil rich in Vitamins A, D and E with Acacia Honey further help skin rebalance itself to reveal a clearer, refreshed-looking complexion.*

**About you:** 22 years old/Fitzpatrick IV/ dry skin prone to dehydration and PIH

**Your opinion:** I have repurchased this mask 4 times and despite trying various others, cheaper and more expensive, *I just can't find anything more effective*. This is the new formulation that now contains niacinamide (10th ingredient). It only needs *five* minutes (I wouldn't leave it on for more than 15 otherwise the clay will dry out your skin). It is perfect for those areas where you have *enlarged pores/ breaking out/more oily* as it works without dehydrating your skin like most clay masks.

I don't use it all over my face, just where I need it. After washing it off, you're instantly rewarded by *smoother, clearer more even looking skin*, any *spots look flatter* and *less red* and tend to be* less inflamed* the next morning! *It does however have a distinct and quite strong smell* (which I like but I know some people are sensitive). 

I know I sould like an advert, but I do adore this mask, *it's good value and it does what it says*. For reference, my mother (45 years old) likes to use it across her nose because she feels like it makes her pores appear smaller (even though she has fantastic skin) and my brother (18) likes to use it all over his face because he's got oily skin and it helps with all the PIH leftover from cystic acne and prevents new breakouts.

**Ingredients:** Aqua (Water), Kaolin, Silt, Cetearyl alcohol, Glyceryl stearate, Polysorbate 60, Sorbitan stearate, Butyrospermum parkii (**Shea butter**), Mel (**Honey**), **Niacinamide**, Persea gratissima (**Avocado) oil**, Maltodextrexin, Citrus aurantium dulcis (**Sweet orange) peel oil**, Citrus aurantium amara (**Bitter orange) oil**, Canaga odorata (**Ylang ylang) flower oil**, Parfum (Fragrance), Phenethyl alcohol, **Salicylic acid**, Caprylyl glycol, PEG-20 stearate, Xanthan gum, Coco-glucoside, Glycerin, Citric Acid, Equisetum arvense (Horsetail) extract, Nasturtium officinale (Watercress) flower/leaf extract, Urtica dioica (Nettle) extract, Sambucus nigra (Elderflower) flower extract, Potassium sorbate, Sodium benzoate, Amyl cinnamal, Benzyl benzoate, Benzyl salicylate, Cinnamyl alcohol, Geraniol, Hexyl cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool, Dipropylene glycol

With the exception of CFC (who look like a great team in great form) and City (who look a great team starting to find it's form) everyone that would be expected to be in the top half of the table has been wildly inconsistent.

If you look at the table from this time last year (13/14 Season) it looked like this:

1. Arsenal - 22 pts
2. Chelsea - 20 pts
3. LFC - 20 pts
4. THFC - 19 pts
5. Soton - 18 pts
6. Everton - 18 pts
7. MCFC - 16 pts
8. United - 14 pts
9. Swansea - 11 pts
10.  Hull - 11 pts

Now look at this years (14/15 season) table:

1. Chelsea - 22 pts
2. MCFC - 17 pts
3. Soton - 16 pts
4. WHU - 13 pts
5. LFC - 13 pts
6. United - 12 pts
7. Arsenal - 11 pts
8. Swansea - 11 pts
9. THFC - 11 pts
10. Stoke - 11 pts

So bar CFC (+2 pts Y/Y), City (+1 pt Y/Y), Stoke (+3 pts Y/Y) and West Ham (+4 pts Y/Y)....every single team in the top half of the table is performing worse this season than last season so far.

If you took the performances from this year and applied it to last year's table MCFC wouldn't even manage 6th place. Soton is in third place this season despite being 2 points worse than last season.

What we are seeing is CFC playing good football out of the gate, City looking like it is settling in and everyone else playing terribly, terribly inconsistent football.  Soton is playing nice football at the moment and beating up on the lower part of the table, WHU is playing more consistent football than everyone else at the moment beyond that it is crap shoot each week as to who will actually play well.

I still think at the end (been saying since summer) it will be CFC and City at 1/2 with Arsenal somehow slipping into 3rd (they seem to find enough points along the way starting in mid-season) and then one of the United, Everton, LFC, Spurs group backing into 4th.

It's great to hear workloads are on the agenda. This is a profession which sees her regularly working a 60 hour week; it is no wonder the career experiences such a high burnout rate. But I think the ""bureaucracy"" angle can be overdone. The long hours are not all about paperwork.

Let me put it like this. Every school day she would spend from 8:00-16:00 in the classroom either with the pupils or with parents (without consistent breaks, as there is always something that needs dealing with over lunch break). That means that the ""other bits"" of teaching are done in the evenings and weekends- such non-bureaucratic things as planning and resourcing lessons, or marking and assessing work, or completing parent-teacher reports. Sure bureaucracy plays some part in that, but by no means the majority.

The only respite at the moment is a previous Labour introduction, ""PPA"" time of 1/2 a day a week to carry out planning and marking. In other countries, equivalent non-teaching time can be much higher. I seem to recall ""half of the timetable"" from at least one country, but I can't cite a source.

It was not always so. Throughout history, bands of children gathered and roamed city streets and countrysides, forming their own societies each with its own customs, legal rules and procedures, parodies, politics, beliefs, and art. With their rhymes, songs, and symbols, they created and elaborated the meaning of their local landscape and culture, practicing for the adult work of the same nature. We are left with only remnants and echoes of a once-magnificent network of children’s cultures, capable of impressive feats of coordination.

So fewer people are paying less tax because this government has taken more people out of income tax by raising the threshold and most new jobs being created are low paid or part time. right?

So even with more people in employment, and fewer people claiming less benefits, we have to continue to increase borrowing because there's less money moving through the economy because people,in general, have less money in their pockets and aren't earning enough to pay as much income and sales tax as they used to, right?

&gt;Mobile phone contracts

&gt;If your phone forms part of your mobile phone contract, your claim would be against your mobile phone service provider and you may be entitled to a free repair or replacement as part of your contract. It’s worth checking your mobile operator’s terms and conditions to see what you’re entitled to.

&gt;In addition to your mobile phone operator’s terms and conditions, you also have your statutory rights under the Supply of Goods and Services Act.

&gt;This means your mobile provider – in addition to providing their service to you with reasonable skill and care – has to ensure the actual handset is of satisfactory quality and fit for purpose.

&gt;If you encounter a retailer that refuses to refund, repair or replace a faulty item, you should complain in writing to the store manager.

&gt;We've often heard of retailers passing the buck when it comes to taking responsibility for products after they develop a fault.

It is simple human nature to panic when the value of our assets fall, but consider this: it is only a loss if you sell the investments - until then it is all imaginary.

So, do you need the money in the short term? If the answer is yes, you shouldn't have used ""real assets"" as a vehicle for holding short-term funds, and you may find yourself *needing* to sell at a loss to fund your requirements. Chalk this down to experience and move on.

If you don't need the money, and you have made sensible arrangements, and your reasons for investing went further than ""I'd like to make a quick £"", then you need to ignore that most basic of emotional reactions and realise this is a time to rejoice - those sensible investments you made just got 5% cheaper!

You comment below that you are worried about buying more now because you have read that investment assets are overpriced. If that is the case, why did you buy them in the first place? 

If you only buy shares when they seem like a good buy (i.e. after stock market rises) and only sell them when they seem like a terrible idea (i.e. after stock market falls), you end up doing pretty badly as an investor.

However, even if you only buy when confidence is high, but never sell, you do pretty well. [Demonstrated here.](http://awealthofcommonsense.com/worlds-worst-market-timer/)

The choice has been made and backing out and saying 'we didn't mean it' isn't going to get us anywhere. The way forward is with the EU, federalization so we can compete with the US and China.

&gt;Give it a break, it's been more than 2 months now.

The team as a whole haven't performed for two months, should we suddenly start dropping and selling most of our players? What about Rodgers? He's spent over 100 million on players who haven't done much in 2 months, should he be fired? That's a lot of money and it's his job to get the players performing.

I didn't claim they would suddenly wake up and start performing. It'll happen over time.

I am not en expert by any means, and I can only give you my understanding of each point, but I would recommend posing the questions to an accountant and letting them answer them on an hourly rate. By knowing allowable exemptions and so on you may find that an ongoing relationship with an accountant is preferable.

1. See above
2. Dividends are received net of a notional 10% basic-rate tax credit, which acknowledges the fact that corporation tax has been paid. This is non-reclaimable. If you become a higher-rate taxpayer dividends attract a further 22.5% tax based on the *gross* dividend (i.e. dividends received / 0.9)
3. You will pay both employee NI (12.0%) and employer NI (13.8%) on anything above the primary/secondary threshold respectively. As a director this will be based on annual earnings not weekly. It may work out being more than you expect. You will qualify for state pension (and other NI-related benefits) as long as your NI-able earnings are above the lower earnings limit, but you won't have to pay NI until you hit the primary/secondary thresholds.
4. Seek advice on this area. Getting allowable expenses wrong can be incredibly expensive if HMRC investigate you.
5. See point 6
6. It is legal, but HMRC can choose to ignore it if they classify you as an employee of the people you contract to. There are a plethora of tests that are undertaken, examples being how much autonomy you have, whether you are responsible for the costs of your own equipment, and so on.

&gt; Says Banksy, estimated net worth £20 million, with six books, films under his belt etc.

It's an ironic quote, but he hasn't changed what he does. He never started out with the intent of making money. He keeps doing it for the same reasons he always did - which just happen to have made him a lot of money. Good for him for raising an otherwise overlooked platform of art and social protest to the radar of the every-day masses.

UK/US are both prime targets for terrorism and so it France which is why we follow the same policy on most fronts and for a bunch of other economic reasons. What's good for the UK tends to be good for for the US and vice versa.

If you take a look at the whole Vietnam thing you'll see it, but the US is the superpower so it's kinda difficult to say no alot of the time being a major power or not. the EU can talk on somewhat equal terms with the US just because it's economy is much bigger but you can kinda play the countries against each other, like Russia is doing. The problem is doing that means your pushing the EU to integrate further.

""We kinda know you guys joined us in Iraq/Afghanistan""

We literally took on the most dangerous southern provinces and proved the second most amount of troops. Seriously look at the numbers, the US comes first (US invasion) by a long shot, then look at British numbers... compared to everyone elses. Kinda joined us when you take up the place with the opium fields where the Taliban were strongest is kinda annoying.

""I don't really see any huge trade agreements happening between us and immigrating between the countries other than for going to university is still extremely difficult so I don't see where all this sucking up is happening from our point of view.""

We're literally negotiating right now a free trade agreement between the EU and the US. The sucking up view comes from the whole Iraq/Afganisatan thing. Mainly Iraq, the French said no and we didn't despite large protests.

Don't be obtuse.  The feather headdresses in question are plainly intended to mimic the ones found in Native American cultures.

I've never seen anyone at a festival wearing headdresses that look remotely like those ones.

You can't compare mockery of extant cultures with mockery of cultures that died out thousands of years ago.  You might as well compare Viking helmets to blackface.

&gt; This would effectively turn the headdress in to a memorial object, and raise some awareness about its origins. I feel that banning the headdress breeds ill feeling.

These headdresses already have very specific meanings and purposes in the cultures they are copied from.  The idea that white people can ""reclaim"" them from other white people is ridiculous.  If you are going to try and raise awareness of a culture, you should do it in a way that members of that culture consider respectful, not as an excuse to be disrespectful.

I understand that probably not many Native Americans will have heard of Glastonbury, and probably not many British people have enough awareness of race relations in North America to know why the feathers are such a sore issue, but I can't understand why it's bad for Glastonbury to discourage mockery of other cultures.",0,1413900814,null,0,false,0,clfjyuq,t3_2jvkeo,t1_clfjyuq,t1_clfh384,null,1426423240,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

false,specofdust,,Abbot. Lots of Abbot.,"Well, Prostate cancer obviously only affects men who tend to be quite bad about saying ""Hey, we need to fix this"". There is no race for life equivalent for men.

That said, while breast cancer is the more common type among women and hits frequently between 20 and 40, prostate cancer tends to disproportionately affect older males (getting it in your 40's is young). Further to this, because prostate cancer is really very survivable in the short to medium term, there's less of an impetus to cure it. Billy Connolly is 71, his life expectancy at this age is approximately 84.

There is a 2/3 chance your average prostate cancer sufferer lasts 10 years anyway, so it's perfectly possible that his heart will fail, or he'll become frail and die from complications related to a fall or any other thing which kills old people, rather than die from the prostate cancer. Sadly, it does do pretty horrific things to the body, and while it's survivable, the effects on the...lower parts...of the body are pretty humiliating and debilitating, from what I understand.

Oh and...balls got nothing to do with prostate cancer, but you probably already knew that nouser :p",0,1413900912,null,0,false,0,clfk0g2,t3_2js77l,t1_clfk0g2,t1_clfjrrj,null,1426423220,1,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,1

No, I'm assertive that all activity carries risk.

&gt;I can only presume that you have, at the very, very least, a ball park estimate of how likely you think it is that this occurs.

I recognise it's common enough that entire websites have been created for people to submit pictures of people to, that so and so leaking/sharing so and so's nudes *appears* to me to be a common occurrence in each social group, and that clearly enough people feel unhappy about this to cause protest and outrage. I wouldn't attempt to stick a number on the likihood of this occurring as obviously each individual case carries different risk.

Into what?? You've lost me here.

Ok, sure, I wasn't actually assuming bad intentions on your part in saying women, but rather just that you were falling into the familiar trap of thinking only of a single gender when it comes to rape rather than all humans.

Overall my point: I'm not going to stick a number on this risk because I haven't quantified it nor seen it quantified - I am going to assert that there is a risk and on face value it would seem to be low-moderate given the nature of humans.

There are no spot lights shining down on things to illuminate what they're filming. Either it's day time or they are simply zooming in on a stadium already lit by its own lights. 

And yes, the Philadelphia sports complex has a parking lot surrounding it that takes up a couple blocks, which are then surrounded by hundreds of thousands of homes. But for every example like that, there are other counter examples such as in Baltimore, Chicago, Pittsburgh, New York, where stadiums do not have that buffer as many were built while the neighborhoods were still growing and becoming more urbanized. These are also where blimps occasionally film a game taking place. And in either case, given the height in which they fly, a few blocks of parking lots are not sufficient buffers to avoid a blimp flying 450 meters above to not capture residential areas. They simply don't spy on people at that distant or do anything else that would result in anyone worrying about their privacy being invaded. It's simply not a concern.

So that isn't a valid reason to explain the lack of blimps in the UK. It may just be a phenomenon specific to the US for no reason besides it just is. I was truly just curious, because I did not know whether they were employed in England or not so I asked the simplest of questions.

Example of a [non-Native American feather hat at Glastonbury](http://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2014/jun/28/glastonbury-2014-get-a-hat-get-ahead?index=16)

They were just random examples of feathered hats used in spiritual ceremonies and special occasions. My point being that feathered hats are common, so why rule against one and not the others?

I don't see how the people who buy those headdresses are mocking or being disrespectful. If anything, they are being naive. They buy and wear the hat because it looks good, not because they want to make fun of anyone.

I personally don't believe any culture has the right to take ownership of any object as their own.

For one thing, discussion definitely does happen about gangs and violence and disenfranchised youths in impoverished areas and whatnot. We do understand that for many people joining a gang is not as simple as someone going ""hmm, I'm a terrible person and I want to kill people, I'm going to join a gang!""

As for going to a warzone: it'd be more like going to visit a friend in a warzone who promised you that they would never blow you up, then having that friend blow you up after you'd trusted them. With naked photographs you put your trust in someone and have it betrayed by them. Revenge porn is nothing like the huge, uncontrollable force of warfare. When you enter a relationship with someone it is not like intentionally entering a warzone.

We all take risks in our daily lives, even with strangers - I step outside the front door and I trust people to not drive down the pavement at 100mph. And with partners we do even more trusting things. My SO and I have a joint account and I trust him not to steal my money from it. I trust him not to poison my food to make me ill when he cooks, or tell all his friends my most personal secrets, or deliberately try to ruin my life. 

There is nothing about sending saucy pictures that is any more innately risky than many other things we do every day. The reason it's such a Thing is because it can be so very, damaging and for some reason is not viewed by many people to be a horrible thing to do to someone. We all like to think we can take one look at someone and go ""they shouldn't be trusted"", but it just isn't true.

Having said all that, there are still flaws with this approach. Many people never even know they've been revenge-porned, so they're outta luck. If someone knows it's illegal they can absolutely find ways to hide themselves. We should be tackling issues around sexual consent and the actual reasons that people feel revenge-porning is anything other than a horrible, awful, immoral thing to do.

* It strikes me that a lot of ""UK Citizens"" living abroad probably aren't what most of us think... i.e. the middle-age/early-retirement couple living in Spain or Cyprus 8 months a year.

* I suspect that actually a lot of these ""UK Citizens"" living abroad might themselves be 1st generation migrants who nominally hold UK Citizenship, probably by way of the commonwealth or non-EU states. The fact they are UK citizens is probably more of a technicality than an ethnic-cultural point.

* For example, when I've spoken to a lot of 1st generation migrants it's not uncommon for them (especially those from Asia and Africa) to have seemingly innumerable cousins and siblings living elsewhere in Europe, and quite a few have chopped and changed states at a moments notice to live/work in other EU nations where they have family or other commitments. 

I appreciate this is entirely anecdotal, and ultimately the meaning of it is perhaps difficult to interpret since by even bringing it up I'm essentially suggesting that one type of citizen is perhaps ""lesser"" than another. But its probably worth bearing in mind that in order to satisfy the now sizable part of the population that clearly want something done about the pace of immigration and are prepared to vote for it, something obviously needs to be done... and the views of these apparent UK citizens living in other parts of the EU probably aren't that significant to the whole debate... harsh as that sounds.

So Income tax is the biggest source of income for the Government, with VAT and NI being the next two.

Consequently, wouldn't it be easier to increase tax income by targetting those taxes? We're already happy to pay all of those taxes - we like our luxury goods, we prefer to work, and we prefer to work for a larger wage. Does that all make sense?

The deficit in those figures (out of date I expect) is 84bn. Income from those three main taxes was almost 400bn.

Now this is where I get a headache...it makes logical sense to me that if one was to stimulate a flagging economy, then you'd do it by making that tax income increase, and you'd do that by encouraging higher wages, giving companies the confidence to create jobs of substance rather than hiring at minimum wage, raising benefit levels above, or at least at the rate of inflation so that the least well off also were more likely to make VATable purchases...You want more people to earn more and subsequently spend more and pay more VAT, NI and Income Tax, surely? 

Wouldn't the easiest way of doing that be to build corporate confidence by allowing more freedom to borrow, shore up the lenders so they don't stop lending to companies who need the buffer zone of solid, reliable credit after a horrible couple of years in a global recession?

So why does it make sense to cut spending, freeze wages, cut benefits, panic the banks into stopping lending, and make millions of civil servants unemployed? How are these austerity measures having a positive effect on the economy, when they're the opposite of the intuitive thing to do?

All these cuts and freezes were supposed to be the **only way** of quickly eliminating the deficit, but they seem to be on the verge of increasing it.

So why was the intuitive way wrong? And if it was wrong, why aren't we seeing deficit reduction targets being met? I might be wrong, but hasn't Osborne failed to meet a single deficit reduction target? Why do people still think his way is the only right way to do it?",0,1413903401,null,0,1413903830,0,clfl6yv,t3_2jvnqk,t1_clfl6yv,t1_clfjeod,null,1426422669,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

I don't know, sounds like one of the worst places in Europe to me. I kind of rate my loved ones not getting raped as a very important metric if we are deciding if a country is ""one of the best"". Also you realize British and American education is only rated that highly when the ranking is done by English speaking institutions right? There is plenty written about this bias.

http://universitypost.dk/article/european-university-lobby-rankings-are-biased

&gt; Rankings focus too much on elite universities, and they are biased towards natural sciences and English-speaking countries. This leads to skewed policies, shows critical report

How good can those universities be anyway if they produce a political class that cannot get rape occurrence below third world levels? Not to mention they are expensive unlike in the rest of the EU, in England at least.

Naismith is fantastic but he doesn't have the swagger of Barkley and Osman in the centre can't do a shift longer than 30 mins nowadays. this meant all our attacks went through Baines and a crocked Pienaar (and Mirallas until he got crocked) which meant it was easy to defend against and reduced them to punting long balls at Lukaku in Liverpool and Utd.

Howard

Baines - Stones - Jagielka - Coleman

The way I see it is, as much as we should try to discourage smoking (by making it as socially unacceptable as possible), even if their proposal were to go through, which I doubt it ever would, I can't see many establishments taking it up.

Firstly, the number of smokers in the UK is dropping by the day.  I used to smoke, as did most of the 20 strong office I work in. There is now only 2 smokers left working here.  There isn't such a large customer base as there once was.  I think it's something like 20% of the UK smokes, a lot of them are teenagers who are actually giving it up as they get older.  Like I did.

Secondly, everyone is used to a completely smoke free environment, reintroducing that, no matter how divided and ventilated etc is likely to put some people off. Smoke doesn't respect boundaries, and it's going to waft into the next room creating a horrible smell for everyone else

Thirdly, the cost of installing something like this. Building entirely separate rooms just for smokers.  Most pubs and restaurants just don't have the space, or the money to do something like this.

There have indeed been several statements by members of the government over the years, indicating their ""heartfelt"" apology over what happened, but that's all. Plus what's the point when years later, you have situations where members of the LDP denounce the Nanjing Massacre as a fabrication.  

If members of the government even consider saying such a thing, the government hasn't seriously done anything to educate and enforce the meaning behind being apologetic for something. Holocaust denial is illegal in many European countries, let alone members of a popular government party publicly doing it.

Or consider many Japanese PMs visit the war memorials of WW2, which include war criminals on them, with shrine panels saying the Nanjing massacre didn't happen. It's actually slap in the face to verbally apologize and keep up with these actions. It's almost like a German pm, making an apology, then publicly going to pay their respects to a shrine of Hitler and the SS.

On one side you have people saying, the Chinese won't accept any apology and keep changing the definition of what they want, and on the other we have the opinion that Japan has never sincerely apologized, and merely used funding and a few political verbal speeches to cover it, which aren't sufficient, that there's never been a cultural attempt to recognize nationally what was done.

Personally I see the problem being that because of the culture of ""face"", respect, being slightly different to the western idea of taking responsibility and respect. That this has caused a divide in the relations, it's like two stubborn people, refusing to commit to any agreement, in-case they look bad to their friends for making the first move.

They also don't get paid for the 30 minute daily break they HAVEN'T taken. It is always assumed you had 30 minutes because they're 'mandatory' and unpaid. This is universal in the NHS. This means if you didn't get a chance for a break, you've given them 30 minutes free labour.

To add insult to injury, nurses are then expected to 'make up' those cumulative 30 minute breaks with an extra shift - because their contracts stipulate minimum hours that are eroded by the theoretical breaks they're not taking. So not only are they cheated out of nearly all their breaks (excepting Night shifts, which do get them) they then have to make up the time they didn't take with free time.

First it has to be tested and proven to work, not on one person but on many.

Then it has to go through processes to make sure it is safe and find out any potential dangers it could cause to certain people.

Then it has to go through more processes to bring the costs down so it can be available to all of us.

I'm sure there is more I'm missing. Call it red tape if you will but that red tape is there for very very good reasons.

Isolationism? Well here's the thing. He spent his entire first term trying to get the Republicans in Congress onto the table for anything at all, and they filibustered close to every single fucking bill the Democrats or any policy he proposed. They tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act 50 times. That's NOT EVEN AN EXAGGERATION. They spent 4 years calling him a Kenyan Muslim socialist, whatever that is, calling his legitimacy for the Presidency into question way before it was justified by his actual performance in the chair. They accuse him of being to party friendly, but when Chuck Hagel is suggested by Obama for office, who was a respected Republican, they even opposed him. 

They went so far as to shut down the government. 

So, yes. Obama's isolationist now. He extended the olive branch too far, you could argue, but you can somewhat understand why he wants nothing to do with them. 

I agree that he has been a disappointment but he is not one because he isolated the Republicans. He is one because he didn't have the strength of his convictions when he promised certain things on the campaign trail and because even given that experience, he still doesn't learn from his mistakes.

I would also be concerned if a group of Romanian men moved in next door to me. Why? Well, first off the house next door to me is 2 bedroom, hardly adequate for a group of men. Then, if they were to live there they could be paid below the minimum wage, which is still a lot to them. I would be concerned for their saftey, wellbeing and if they were being involved in criminal activity.

But the whole point of the EP is debate, debating the issue and trying to convince others that your concerns are valid.

Nigel Farage isnt doing that, and is not therefore serving the public interest, its not ""just a rubber stamp"" but an actual debate.

&gt; Looking at what they've achieved they've certainly being using their time for something productive.

What have they achieved? All theyve done is hurl insults at other MEPs (and the president) and in general make Britian look like uncompromising whiny babies.

between UKIPs 12 MEPs they have tabled no reports, 11 have tabled no opinions, nine have signed no written declarations or motions, and seven have tabled no amendments to reports ranking them at the bottom of the pile out of all 753 MEPs. Sounds like theyve achieved *so much*.

I might believe your argument that they where doing other constructive things throughout the UK if they hadnt taken £11.5 million in salaries, staffing and office costs. And that is not even counting their expenses. Whilst the Liberal Democrats have done the most work in the European Parliament for the least amount of money of any British MEPs.

UKIP has **only 1 decent MEP**, The Earl of Dartmouth, Ukip’s representative for the South-west. He has asked over 550 questions and made over 260 speeches yet only cost the taxpayer £50,000 more than Mr Farage.

In conclusion, whatever you think ""UKIP have achieved"" is complete bollucks. They are a detriment to Britain and the British people.

&gt; Incidentally UKIP councillors have the highest attendance in the UK.

Because it's about pacing.  You can't blow it all at once.  

Besides, the way we are playing right now, we're not a CL quality team.  We all cheered when we got Ludogorets in our CL group, but if not for a extra-time penalty, we'd drew them.  At home.

And tomorrow, we all fully expect us to be embarrassed by Real Madrid.

We were lucky and spoiled last year to have a player like Suarez who could single-handedly put the team on his back and carry us to victory.  We don't have that luxury this year.

The fact of the matter is that right now, we are a mid-table team.  Migs' decision making in goal is questionable at best.  Our defending is leaky at best.  Our midfield is lackluster, save for a few quality long-balls from an aging Gerrard.  Our ""big"" signing in Mario is coming up short, Sterling is being plagued with injuries again.

Sterling and Couthino are looking great, but they alone won't carry us anywhere.

You really have to be kidding. 

From the last window:
Origi (19), Can (20), Manquillo (20), Markovic (20) , Moreno (22) even Balotelli is only 24.

Add the other buys of Lallana (26) and Lambert (32) and the average age of our 7 buys was 23. Exclude the somewhat anomalous Lambert from that and we've bought 6 players there with an average age of 21.

Now consider that these buys are being added to what was already the youngest squad in the whole Premier League in the 2013/2014 season with an average age of just over 24.

http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/lfc-are-premier-league-s-youngest

So, if anything, it's the club's policy to target ever younger players as we go forward. It's ALL about youth/potential because we can't outspend United, City, Chelsea and Arsenal. It's the reason the Club/FSG got the scouts from City.

You can't pace it out at 6th place for a couple of years because then our top players want out and we are then unable to buy suitable replacements because we don't have the CL money and more importantly, we aren't competing with the other top clubs!

We are a CL quality team, because we are in the CL and we 100% deserve to be there after a fantastic season last season. We are performing pretty badly due to a number of different factors (injuries, squad taking time to gel, inexperience with large fixture list) but the only way we can combat these issues is through experience and through consistently aiming to be the best, not a 6th place team in transition.

We were not lucky last season. We surprised a lot of people, but we were not 'lucky'. We had a good first XI, a great manager, a couple of standout players and a very nice fixture list. But we cannot build on that unless we strive to be a team consistently in those CL places every year.

Nobody is expecting to win the league this year. Very few would have said we would before even a ball was kicked. My expectations at the start of the season were to have a few solid cup runs and retain CL football, rather than drop off as we did after Rafa nearly won the title a few years back. My argument is not that we should be a top team right now, but that we should be aiming to be a top team and the way to do that is by consistently achieving CL football.

Teams are not built in a season, you're right. This is Brendan's third season and he nearly won the league last season.

There is a world of difference between banning smoking tobacco indoors because it's harmful to people who've not made the choice to smoke, and banning something because people find it unpleasant when there is absolutely no evidence at all to suggest its harmful. 

I'm not saying you're wrong in suggesting it smells crap and that you'd rather not sit around it, some vaporiser liquids stink and I'd certainly rather not sit around an unpleasant smell, but I don't think a subjective opinion (which at the end of the day, is exactly what smell is.) should be something we should ban.

 After a hard fought battle all game the match is tied 0-0 in the 85th minute. Just then, Coutinho picks up the ball and feeds a delicious through-ball to Balo who is racing on to it from the left channel, leaving Marcelo in the dust as he bears down on Casillas' goal. Without any hesitation Balo nutmegs the on-rushing GK and slots the ball into an empty net. 

Casillas is distraught on the ground, the Kop is going wild. Ronaldo is desperately signaling to the Madrid bench to be substituted because he can't take it anymore. 

The camera pans to Rodgers who has a devious smile on his face, then quickly back to Balotelli who appears to be pulling his shirt off to display another ""Why always me"" undershirt. But wait. What's this? Instead of taking of his shirt Balo is actually shedding his skin. The costume is coming off, under the mask is Luis Suarez with a smug look on his face. He kisses his wrists, takes a defiant bite out of Ancelotti as he strides off the pitch. Madrid proceed to lose 5-0 as Gerrard scores 4 free kicks in the last 3 minutes of the game.

4. Look for things such as the /r/askuk thread I linked you to and just offer to meet up or ask if they mind if you tag along. 

5. If you buy tickets on scarletmist (last minute fan-to-fan cost only ticket selling website), they have several categories and often those selling a spare ticket say 'happy for you to come with us.'

So on."", you'd get a more accurate reflection of what countries the British people think should be part of a free travel zone.

The problem with the EU (as far as British perception goes) is that it includes many poor countries. UK GDP per Capita is something like $44,000 (taken off IMF 2014), and we're being asked to share free travel zones with Bulgaria ($7,328), Romania ($8,874), Poland (£13,435), and even going up to Greece ($22k). Then you look at Germany ($45k), France ($44k), Denmark ($60k), Italy ($35k), and Spain ($30k). Those I got from Wikipedia, because IMF doesn't list them all nicely: of note is the UK's GDP per Capita on wiki is $40k.

I'm not anti-EU, but it's really easy to make an anti-EU case on those numbers. No British person is ever going to move to fucking Bulgaria unless a job they got in the UK makes them go there. The reverse isn't true: many Bulgarians will move west (not just to the UK) because standards of living here are far higher.

This poll doesn't show a contradictory attitude at all. If you delve deeper I'd bet money that you'll discover the British people are totally ok with the French, Germans, Dutch, Belgians, Spanish, so on, moving here as they please, and far less amused with the extremely poor eastern European countries having the same privileges.

First, we're experiencing high winds due to a fucking hurricane. Every wind turbine in the country is flat out.

Second, of the 9.5GW of installed Nuclear capacity, 3.5GW is offline right now: Hartlepool is offline, Heysham 1 is offline, Torness is on reduced operation and Hunterston has 1 reactor entirely offline.

So yes, well done outperforming 63% of our Nuclear power capacity during extreme winds.

I'm pro-wind, but all these green idiots that spout their bullshit about it ""beating nuclear hurr durr"" and it ""sweeping away fossil fuel!!1"" are doing more harm than good. Learn the facts, learn how electricity works, and defend wind from a standpoint that isn't ""I just don't like the thought of evil coal!"".

Throughout the entire month of September, wind energy output UK wide was skidding along the floor at 1-2% of national production. It was so quiet that Scotland, traditionally a constant exporter of power to England, was importing English power because all our wind turbines weren't doing a thing.

October has been a windy month.

Consider this as food for thought: So many people on reddit and beyond are getting wet dreams about the Energiewende in Germany and how it's forcing fossil fuel plants offline. The entire European energy industry regards the energiewende as a perfect example of how **not** to introduce renewable energy onto your electricity grid and, in fact, think that Germany's recklessness might have actually slowed down worldwide adoption of renewable energy.

Nigel Farage isn't leading the actual debate?  I think his speeches get far more air time than anybody else.

They'd love Farage to not be so outspoken!

At a committee level what's the point of a talking shop when you know how the vote is going to go?  Best spend your time wisely - and even if you disagree with them they have been very productive.

&gt;What have they achieved? All theyve done is hurl insults at other MEPs (and the president) and in general make Britian look like uncompromising whiny babies.

They've kicked the door open of 3 party politics and controlled the UK debate.  They warned about the Euro crisis years in advance.  They even warned against EU policy giving rise to the likes of Golden Dawn.   

It's the EU that has been uncompromising towards Federalism and it has cost the EU dear.

&gt;between UKIPs 12 MEPs they have tabled no reports, 11 have tabled no opinions, nine have signed no written declarations or motions, and seven have tabled no amendments to reports ranking them at the bottom of the pile out of all 753 MEPs. Sounds like theyve achieved so much.

Why on Earth would you expect them to table motions through a body which they state they don't believe any motions should be passed, which they wish to disband?

That's like complaining the Tories aren't socialist enough because they aren't socialists.

&gt;I might believe your argument that they where doing other constructive things throughout the UK if they hadnt taken £11.5 million in salaries, staffing and office costs. And that is not even counting their expenses.

They've not taken nearly enough.   

That's UK taxpayer money.

&gt;In conclusion, whatever you think ""UKIP have achieved"" is complete bollucks. They are a detriment to Britain and the British people.

It is inevitable the UK will leave the EU at some point because the UK cannot follow the EU into federalism and that's where the deflating EZ must go.

UKIP will be the facilitators to this departure and return of sovereignty, replacing a course to EU federalism for a course of trade and UK accountability: their service is priceless.

Sam made a great adjustment at halftime and switched to a flatter midline, allowing us to widen the pitch and take advantage of Enner and Diafra's speed through the channels. He also pushed the fullbacks up higher to put more pressure on Burnley's midfielders/backline.

You are right that they looked a bit disjointed Saturday*, but it was because Burnley was tactically sound in denying them the ball in the first 45'. Watching the second half and the last few games gives you a better idea of their capabilities playing off each other. They both have outstanding positional awareness.
