true,ctesibius,UnionFlag,Various Triumphs,"Have you already done something about trousers? I agree that helmet, jacket and gloves are the highest priority, but I'd suggest that if you can't afford leather trousers, it's a good idea to get at least some kevlar jeans. Hood jeans seem to be well recommended, but cost about £100. I have some Oxford jeans that I got from Ghostbikes for £45 inc p&amp;p. Definitely not as good as leather, but better than nothing.

Have a look at [Sharp](http://sharp.direct.gov.uk) for some solid information on safety of different helmets, and some indicative prices. You can shave the budget there and still get a safe helmet. The down side may be things like noise and ventilation, but even so, they should be acceptable for that.

It's probably going to be necessary to budget a bit more for a jacket unless you hit a sale. It should be cow hide, thick enough so that it bends rather than folds or crumples when you flex it, and stitched at seven stiches per inch. Armour at the elbows is valuable, and most jackets have it now.

2. You never established that Lush actually took any oil money. At worst, it's money inherited upon the death of someone who made money in oil.

Play around with the options on the comparison sites, check how it is with different vehicles, even where you keep the car overnight, sometimes it's cheaper to keep it on the road rather than in a garage (due to the frequency of accidents people have backing into their garage). 

As someone else said further down, add some older named drivers! Loads of them, if you've got a relative over 40 with a relatively clean driving record, throw them on your insurance quote! Just try it on a comparison site, add 3 or 4 and see how much you're quoted. Doesn't mean you have to let them drive the thing :P

If you're not particuarily knoweldgable about cars, the RAC run an [approved dealer](http://www.rac.co.uk/buying-a-car/rac-approved-dealers/) scheme. You might pay a slight premium for cars that are sold be approved dealers, but it's worth it to know it's not going to explode as soon as you drive it off the lot (for me anyway!).

true,mateiharry,null,null,"Esterhazy, you have me at a disadvantage - I don't know who you are - yet you boldly propose to raise tone. Fine.

The substance is spelt out in the paragraphs before the transcript and the conversation has a lot of meaning itself. Now:

It's tabloidesque because it shows how a company as right-on as Lush, which gains a great following from its self-serving activism, has an American CEO who comes from a dynasty of oil and mining money, and lots of it. Not an investigation per se, but an analysis and a satirical approach to its holier-than-thou marketing style. Further:

1. Castevet's PR hacks checked me out thoroughly (as he admits), otherwise he wouldn't have called my phone. You are naive or feigning naivete if you think the way he treated me as a possible shill for the oil industry is anything but a tactic aimed at discrediting the work. You say it's clear what he said. Elaborate. What did he say? The whole transcript's there.

2. Lush sold the right to open shop to Mr Wolverton in exchange for money. Wolverton Securities is not just his dad's company, it's his family's business, in which he took a very active hand, pretty high up as well. Therefore it's true to say that whatever money he paid for the Lush brand when he stared (and however little money) - even via real estate - was still oil money. Again, you are either dumb or playing dumb.

3. I'm insulted. Your gall takes me by surprise. The reason I've posted the entire conversation is because what Castevet says only makes sense in context. He is media-coached and evasive. He is making an analogy to explain his own hypocrisy, then presumes 'we are all the same'. It is you, Ezterhazy, who are putting things out of context.

4. Mr Mark Wolverton's job title is President and CEO of Lush North America. Lush is privately held and owned by mr Castevet. You labour under the impression it is a public enterprise. Read the article again or do your own research. If you think 'it's neither surprising nor remarkable that a businessman involved in a company that markets itself as green isn't actually an environmentalist' - to the extent that Lush markets itself as not just green, but Gaia itself, and to the extent that Mr Wolverton is 'involved' as you put it, in Lush - I hope you are not a journalist.

5. For a journalist to ask a public figure, owner of a multinational company about his family business connections as they pertain to his public affairs/ business/ marketing interests is not the same as for the interviewee to retort about the journalist's brothers/ sisters. I'm sorry I have to point that out to you. I have fully comprehended Castevet's point and found it disturbing.

7. What do you think he meant when he said Lush would offer me its support to fight against the Rosia Montana mine? I am convinced he meant to have me join a Lush campaign, and nobody works for free.",0,1404177447,null,0,false,0,cilcaey,t3_29iahw,t1_cilcaey,t1_cila9ec,null,1434490274,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

20 years ago, Manchester felt so much safer than the small rural town I grew up in. 

Now, it's very rare I step foot in to Manchester City Centre during a weekend as it has a very threatening atmosphere about it. I was especially shocked about how bad it is in Piccadilly. The gardens always had a bit of a bad rep, but the number of random drunks and homeless people sitting around the fountains looking at the small children who seemed to have been left to their own devices by their drunken parents is disgraceful. 

Couple that with the masses of empty beer cans, take away boxes and even used needles that cover the ground then it's a no-go area for me personally.

The beauty of this monster, of this episode, was that everything the Doctor usually does with the monster of the week; taking control of the situation, trying to find out what the monster is and what it wants, and trying to calmly diffuse everything, led to the people believing *he* was the monster and turning on *him*. Revealing a physical form, or even just showing the Doctor properly defeating it, would ruin both the monster, and Midnight. Trying anything else would pretty much be a rehash of the episode.

Although, I like the fan theory that it was a monster similar to the one from The Satan Pit or Abaddon (from Torchwood.)

true,Jackpot777,null,null,"Excellent stuff, but there's something that has been on my mind for years and it cropped up in the comments. 

The use of the phrase ""a spot of tea"" specifically to indicate British people talking about drinking tea. 

As a Yorkshire born lad who also lived closer to London (Stevenage) and now living in Pennsylvania, I just want to say that only Americans say ""a spot of tea"". British people will say they ""fancy a brew"" or ""could murder a cuppa"", but never ever ""a spot of tea"". I spent the first 31 of my over 44 years of life in Britain. Almost 15 of those years was working on the railway, so a lot of tea was made and a lot of accents were heard. Not once did anyone say ""a spot of tea"". 

And what I've noticed is Americans only say ""a spot of tea"" when they're referring to British people drinking tea. Which makes me think a lot of Americans think it's a common British phrase. 

The only instance I found of it in literature was [in a C.E.Murphy book called Urban Shaman](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/tea) ...she's from Kansas. 

Even the TVTropes page on tea is called [Spot Of Tea](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotOfTea) ...the only instances on the page it's used is by the page's author, not in any of the cited sources at all. Because British people have no idea why Americans keep using the phrase with a Mockney accent. 

The only other example of this (that I can think of) is when Americans think Australians say ""throw a shrimp on the barbie"", when the only Aussie ever to say it was Paul Hogan in an ad made for US television and he had to use American terminology. Aussies don't call them shrimp, they call them prawns (but if Hogan had said ""chuck a prawn on the barbie and maybe get a tinny out of the esky"" he wouldn't have been understood).

You really have to wade through the shit to get an accurate and unbiased view of the news with the Mail.

If they constantly label people by their Muslim religion during negative stories, and use more semantically heavy words like prostitute, and then pick up on the mosque statement despite it not being accurate, and this is repeated several times a week, then Mail readers subconsciously link all these things to be true.

It's like how benefit automatically leads to scroungers in our minds now, giving a bad view of an otherwise good system. Even more simply put, the word juvenile conjures up the word delinquent immediately, tacking on negative connotations to the harmless former thanks to the aggressive latter.

Citation? I've never heard this before and I've never experienced it.

They have significantly LESS emissions, that's why the tax is significantly cheaper. Diesels are far better for the environment.

&gt;anyone driving less than 12,000-15,000 miles per year is unlikely to benefit overall from the lower fuel costs

No, diesels are big savers at that range, but they are still a lot cheaper than petrol cars at small mileages  and short distances. In my experience diesel cars even out perform petrol hybrids in terms of money spent per month on fuel. I've never heard of someone spending less than me on fuel each month apart from my buddy who rides a 125cc crosser.

&gt;And they're often noisy and less enjoyable to drive, especially the ones in OP's budget.

Our manufacturing sector remains larger than our financial sector. We also have a large service sector and creative industry (which strangely bundles software and art together).

Britain has a very diverse and overall balanced economy. We are roughly middle of the road on pretty much everything. The only imbalances we have are a strange housing market and an overly strong pound.

true,Girlwithnousername,,Proud 2nd member of STFC Official Fan Club. Go the oranges!,"&gt; If someone that open in the public eye can get away with it for ~60 years how easy must it be for an average joe to conceal it?

Two things: 1) the internet and 2) awareness. 

The internet has lead (led?) to instant sharing of information and has created an easy forum for victims to be able to discuss, read about and share information and 2) awareness; well, that's a change in attitude. When I lost my virginity to rape, it wasn't seen as 'rape' - rape wasn't a word that was in frequent use at the time. What actually happened was that my then-boyfriend wouldn't take no for an answer, and charmingly after he took my virginity then reported it to his friends and it spread around the town that 'she has no pubic hair' - well, what the fuck do you expect? I was 14 and I had not yet hit puberty. I digress. Anyway, back in those days it was seen as me being 'frigid.' I can't imagine it would have occurred to anyone I knew at the time to accuse him of raping me, because he didn't pin me down and he wasn't violent towards me, and such an act would have never been considered as rape back then. It's only been in the last few decades that the use of the word 'rape' has become far more prevalent and it's now thankfully public knowledge that it's not okay to have sex with someone against their will.

Similarly, and I realise I've gone off on a tangent, groping/and/or sexually assaulting kids/teenagers was only far more prevalent in previous decades because people could damn well get away with it and seldom feared the wrath of internet witch-hunting campaigns. 

They've been doing it for decades and it's only coming to light now because people have easier methods to share information. ",0,1404203680,null,0,false,0,cilky1j,t3_29hbgq,t1_cilky1j,t1_cikwxkw,null,1434495041,2,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,2

The best way to get a good quote from these is to put your parents on your policy aswell but just as named drivers, have their milage set as high and yours as low as possible but make sure it adds up to roughly how many miles you do a year. For examples

Dad: 2-3k
Mom: 2-3k
You: 0-1k
7k miles, you can go above or over this it's just a guide like. (Setting the total lower will bring down insurance but even if you set it high usually you will get some money back if you dont do 7k miles.

Other ways the price comes down is if your car is in a locked garage over night or like if it has an immobilizer.

My first year quote with them on a 1.4 mk4 Golf was about £1,700 but after the first 3 months they gave me £350 of that back so in total I paid: £1350

My second year quote with them on the same car was about £850, they refunded me £60 a few months ago though so it's about £790 at the minute.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"The question is how do you stop this, I should mention here my parents used to run a day nursery in a very poor part of the UK, they ended up closing it down when Labour allowed pre-schools associated with schools to have staffing ratios half of those required for a day care establishment.  This really pissed off my mum as she has her PGCE!

Minimum wage is a problem, if you've got a young child it's a 3:1 staffing ratio.  That's before rent or insurance comes into it.  It's also unlikely you will be able to have 3 children all the time for that one member of staff.  This means that many places consider the babies to be a loss leader, they make a loss until your child is old enough to be in the more profitable 2.5+ category.

What is far sadder however is that we put children to be nursery nurses who are thick as pig shit.  When my dad was in hospital, I did the pay roll and helped run things for a bit.  Whilst this happened, NI was increased.  This meant that many of the staff were getting less in their pay packet than before.  Now they were all getting a raise, but that was happening after my father was back from hospital as some of the parents hadn't been notified about the new fees changing.  Whenever you raise fees, you loose customers in a business like that, so it's very difficult.  Even harder to get these girls to understand percentages.  The schools put students to do a GVNQ in childcare when they were too thick for anything else.  Your precious little life is being cared for by the academic rejects.  Luckily my parents had a few core staff who were doing it mostly for the love of children, including the rarest of all, the male nursery nurse!  In the end, we didn't allow staff to use the microwave, GNVQ qualified level 4 people couldn't understand you can't put metal in it.  3 microwaves gave their life before that decision was made.

I look back at what my parents did, they worked on this for about 15 years, I made more in a month selling my time than they did in a whole year working very, very long hours.

I said I'd just make things, try and go back to my uni days of inventing stuff without worry.

One thing I really want to make is an open source designed car distance camera for motorways and the like.  I'm in favour of reducing the number of people who have licenses based on demonstrated poor driving.  I don't consider speed to automatically be one of those metrics.  I've driven the motorways late at night, travelling at *ahem* 70, with perfect safety, 4+ seconds of visibility etc.  Meanwhile I've been in 50mph traffic, with people having fraction of seconds gap in very bad rain.  Speed doesn't kill people, inappropriate speed does, but we seldom measure that, instead it's conflated into one metric.

I think it would be interesting to see what would happen if I made a production ready distance camera, which would detect the gaps road users have on the motorway, this should be fairly easy with computer vision, a little bit of clever processing could save massively on hardware.

What would happen as far as the policy makers, and the public go?  The idea of having these distance measuring cameras, I wonder how it would be taken....",0,1404208427,null,0,false,0,cillq4c,t3_29jphp,t1_cillq4c,t1_cillo4z,null,1434495574,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

**Is it pretty much required to have a club membership to have any hope at getting tickets? I am willing to pay the $45 but would like to avoid it if possible.**

Pretty much, yes. While it is possible to buy without a membership, this will require either ringing up on the phones or going down to the ticket office window. To buy them online you will need to log in with your official LFC membership I'm afraid.


**Are secondary ticket markets reliable? In the US, we have many online brokers that you can reliably (albeit above face value) purchase tickets from others.**

No, no and no. There is no official secondary market for second hand tickets that is recognised/authorised by the club. I know the blueshite and a few advertise using StubHub/Viagogo etc for ticket resale, however Liverpool don't. Whenever you're buying a ticket off someone, always be careful. 

NEVER send money over Paypal/bank transfer and expect the tickets to pop through the post. Don't get me wrong, there are genuine reds out there who can't make the game so they resell their ticket, however there are also a fair share of evil bastards more than willing to lead you on with the promise of tickets and take your money without giving you as much as the steam off their piss. Scams like this will be more common around the derby/Mancs/Chelsea games etc.

If you do arrange to buy a second-hand ticket, always meet them in person, with people around. The Shankly statue outside the Kop is used fairly frequently, also the flagpole by E1//2/3/4/5 turnstiles is good, usually a lot less crowded, and you can get signal on your phone!

**Will it be difficult to find lodging over a match day weekend?**

No way. Liverpool is quite a big city. You're always gonna find somewhere close to stay. There are loads of hotels in the city centre, and quite a lot of guesthouses, etc to stay in. If the unlikely happens, and for whatever reason you can't find somewhere to stay in town, you could always stay in Speke/Warrington and get the train in to town. Usually only takes 10 mins from Speke and 20 from Warrington. Accommodation isn't a problem.

One word of advice, I assume this is your first game? 

If so then don't be that lad that rocks up expecting tickets on the Kop for the derby or Manchester United/City, or one of the other big games. Try and get to a smaller game first. One of the newly promoted teams would be ideal. You'll definitely have more of a chance to get a ticket to those games for sure.

true,mushroomgodmat,null,null,"&gt;Maybe it's just me but when you say 'motorist' I think of a single car

I hate the word 'motorist'. Whenever I use It I'm totally aware that im finger pointing in much the same way as those who point fingers at 'cyclists'. Its the reason I clarify myself and say most motorists are fine, and I believe most cyclists are fine too.

But yes - all motorized traffic (so hgvs/buses) are a potential problem. Buts its not so much the vehicle as the persons attitude - or terrible road design.

&gt;My bus driver today was weaving between cyclists and whilst he pulled it off and they didn't seem to mind - I would have found it intimidating to have a double decker bus pass me as it did...

Yep - whenever I get ranty about cycling (and that's quite often ;)...It is because I want to normalize cycling so kids, OAPs, and my wife who are not sporty, fit or aggressive enough to mix with traffic can. Personally speaking I don't really feel in any danger on the roads, but I worry allot for my wife. And that's totally down to the actions of drivers like the bus driver you mentioned here.

&gt;I digress - ultimately the best way to get around this problem is to provide a completely separate route that cyclists can use (especially some kind of arterial network through major cities and towns) that keeps them well away from motorists.

Total agreement. At the moment in the UK cycle lanes are very hit and miss. And we need joined up lanes, we need to make it convenient to use a bike. The bonus for everyone is less cars as a result. Even motorists win.

But not always....In cities where there's no space for a cycle lane, Id like to see a blanket 20mph speed limit. I feel motorists hate this (in fact I don't like driving at 20) but it will make towns and streets safer.

Convincing the general public of the benefits of cycle lanes (and cycling), and 20mph limits is a massive uphill struggle. Iv lost count of the times ive read someone say ""the war on motorists"" when someone suggests slowing cars in built up areas, or removing a section of road for a cycle lane.

In some sense the tax system is already a punitive disincentive against working (via income tax) and against consumption (via VAT), and its already well established that we tax vices such as gambling, alcohol, smoking. So my argument is that its better to attach more of the punitive disincentives onto actively harmful activities - whether harmful for the individual or harmful for society - as we already do with cigarettes. Particularly I want externalities priced into the goods. So for example, using petrol releases greenhouse gases which will affect our children and possibly us. The idea would be that the tax on petrol (note that this is an example of something that is already heavily taxed) would somehow cover the cost of the damage to the environment, for example by paying for carbon capture. I would make a similar argument about sugar consumption in this country - its well understood now that refined sugars and starches consumed in excess lead to obesity, heart disease, diabetes etc. Unfortunately the human appetite is tuned to generally desire an excess of these types of food. I think we should either tax sugar etc at a sufficiently high level to significantly reduce consumption, or we should tax it at a level that ensures that the tax revenue funds NHS treatments for obesity and class 2 diabetes.

true,MrPattonhead,null,null,"During my first year, I worked 3 days doing 8-12 hours shifts at a nursing home (I was only a waiter) but it paid really good and every month I would walk away with around £800. It was always nice to not have to count down the days till student loan day. I found it very hard to juggle my work load and working (In uni 3 days and working 3 days), I'm studying Graphic Design so there is insane amounts of folder work. But I passed first year with an average grade of 50% so was pleased but I was constantly being pulled into meetings with my lecturers because I was underachieving, which I was I just didn't have the time to do more work. I worked through the summer of first year and quit just before second year started with enough money saved to carry me through the next years. It was certainly worth getting a lower grade to have the money, Although I was seen to be a ""weaker"" student in the eyes of my lectures, who were constantly telling me to quit my job. I also went on most night outs going out probably 2-3 times a week because this is a must do!!! 

Are you moving into halls? As when I talk to people on my course that haven't moved and commute, they always give me the impression they feel like they've missed out on first year antics. I would recommend moving into halls. 

Run for course Rep, This will hopefully put you very close with both the student body and the staff, meaning if you need help you could pretty much ask anyone on your course and all the staff know your name. 

If you do miss lectures just a quick email as to why you couldn't make it go's along way with lecturers, (in my case) they get really pissed if you miss one and don't give them a reason, Yet a quick email explaining often got me a 20 minute lecture review and 1-1 feedback.

Take up a sport if you can, I tried to do Rugby (never played it in my life) but their training and matches where whilst I was working, seriously felt like I missed out there.

Good luck and just enjoy it.

The cyclist starts the turn to the left of the road, putting in out of view to a driver who is coming up behind him. He slows down to under 10mph because it's uphill. Because of the low speed and it being a left turn, he drifts out towards the centre of the road, the driver then had about half a second to slam on the brakes or hit him.

1: give way being a foreign concept. Don't pull out on give way lines if a car is coming, it's not hard. Even less hard, don't pull out on a roundabout if there are cars coming, especially if said car is indicating that he's coming off the next exit and will drive into you if he doesn't slam on the breaks.


2: undertaking on left hand turns and bends. It's stupidly dangerous, you can slow down for a few seconds and make sure you stay behind the vehicle.


3: cycling at full speed in between two lanes of cars in traffic or traffic lights. It takes around a second for you to go from not being in the cars mirrors at all to being right up next to them which, coincidentally is also about the time it takes  to release the handbrake and pull off after checking your mirrors in a car.


4: crossing zebra crossings at full speed. Extremely hard for cars to see you in time and stop, you're looking for people waiting at the stop, not 20 metres down a path. If a car is in a position where he can't safely stop or he's already partially over the crossing, you do not have right of way, stop.",0,1404212027,null,0,1404217400,0,cilmbcp,t3_29jphp,t1_cilmbcp,t1_cill92u,null,1434495925,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

My local council are about to spend [£760 000](http://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/local/dundee/dedicated-riverside-cycle-path-ruled-out-1.438121) on our Riverside drive to make it 'more welcoming for pedestrians and cyclists'.

And despite saying this, they've 'ruled out' a dedicated cycle path! 

So for some odd reason they're going to spend all this money to make a 4-lane road into a 2-lane road and NOT put in a dedicated cycle lane?

It's a popular route along the river, and it would have been nice to have a separate path so we don't have to weave around prams and joggers....

The council claim it's because not enough people cycle there, there are always people out there! And I think if provision was better then more people are going to use it.

The roads terrify me, I've had several near-misses on roundabouts here, and whilst I love cycling I really don't want to be squished so I go on pavements whenever they're wide enough for me and pedestrians.

When you've got so many of the qualities Rodgers wants in his players, qualities that Rodgers' system is built upon, then it doesn't matter that the player's just had one good season - he's coming into a setup that's very similar to the one he had success in. 

Contrast that to someone like Fellaini, who predictably struggled at United because he was being played in a different position (box-to-box midfielder) to the one where he had so much success at Everton (a sort of no.10 target man); or even Downing, who went from being a big component of a counter-attacking Villa side to impotent in a Liverpool team faced with packed defences; or Charlie Adam, who played in a 3-man midfield at Blackpool that allowed 2 others to cover for all his deficiencies, and then got found out in a 2-man midfield for Liverpool.",0,1404212238,null,0,false,0,cilmcri,t3_29jvba,t1_cilmcri,t1_cilm5e4,null,1434495952,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9

Landlords these days are legally required to keep your money in a tenancy assurance scheme.

If he doesn't, you're looking at a small claims court claim.

In your circumstances, the best way to protect your money is take hundreds of photos of anything remotely damaged when you move in, take a thorough inventory of everything with all damage clearly noted (12 plates, small chips on one, drawer slightly loose, etc) and give him a copy, ideally getting him to sign it. Note and photograph the cleanliness of the place because it's a classic landlords scam to withhold £250 for 'professional cleaning' when you leave and never actually clean. Keep these photos and inventory safe.

Others will say it better than me but this really isn't an ideal living situation, and you should try and find a better arrangement as quickly as possible.

true,LS69,eng-yorkshire,We are Leeds,"&gt; Most unified hatred in that period comes from the aftermath. Where the Tories shut down good and bad alike so they could crush the unions completely. Viable industries were swept away with the unviable just because they could. That doesn't mean everyone agreed with Scargill. Most people seriously dislike Scargill for giving Thatcher the excuse she needed to cripple entire regions.

This is the problem in a nutshell. I despise Scargill for playing into her hands, but when the question is asked, ""are the Tories the nasty party?"", I can't ever forgive or forget the cruelty inflicted by Thatcher on mining towns, for example removing all emergency benefits provided to the children of strikers.  She starved kids to break strikes.

To me this is the crux of the article :

""But the educational aspirations of kids from former mining towns are still being affected by the positioning of those communities as 'the enemy within' by the prime minister of the time, Margaret Thatcher. It's hard to see that you have a stake in things when your family and community have been positioned like that.""""

true,M2Ys4U,eu,Manchester,"&gt;Using tax as a ""lever"" for raising levels of regional growth, Mr Miliband cited the Greater Manchester Combined Authority as a model for how cities and counties can pool their resources and know-how to make a difference.

&gt;For the past three years, the 10 councils in Greater Manchester have been co-ordinating their economic development, regeneration and transport functions to try and map out a long-term plan for sustainable, balanced economic growth.

The GMCA is great and everything, but it's seriously lacking in accountability and legitimacy.

I'd much rather a Greater Manchester Authority be set up along the lines of the Greater London Authority - with a directly-elected assembly and mayor. As it stands now, the GMCA is effectively just the leaders of the 10 councils.

I doubt Labour would ever agree to set it up though, they have almost *total* control in the region - Manchester City Council is effectively a one-party state and they really do not want to lose their fiefdom.",0,1404214351,null,0,false,0,cilmqqh,t3_29jofv,t1_cilmqqh,t3_29jofv,null,1434496231,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,arathkone,null,null,"With some of how this all went down seemingly coming out now i.e. him stating he'd never play for Saints again, how he refers to coming to Liverpool will change his ambitions:

""They have to - it's a huge club that wants to win titles again and compete in the Champions League. There are different targets to what a club like Southampton has, but I'm just going to be pushing to do the best I can.""

How is that different to what ANY club wants, of course Saints aren't Liverpool but we strive for as much success as possible like everyone else.

Looking at his 5 year extension from April 2013:

""I'm absolutely delighted,"" said Lallana. ""To commit my future to the Club for the next five years is something I'm really happy about.

""I can't wait to work with the new management team and the lads to continue our progress in the Premier League. It was an easy decision for me with the direction the Club is going in.

""I've been at the Club since I was 12 and – being honest – I can only see my future lying with Southampton Football Club.

""If someone was to say that I'd end my career playing for Southampton in the Premier League then I'd snap your hand off for it.

""I am privileged and honoured to be given the opportunity to be here for the next five years. It's something I'm going to look to grab with both hands.

""I'm honoured to be playing for Southampton and captaining the Club at the present moment, and I just hope the next five years don't go as quickly as the previous five! 

""I can't wait to get going and to continue playing for this club.""

It all just leaves a sour taste. I think Southampton fans were proud to have him in our club and to see how he's grown with us to become an England international etc.  Maybe it's just we sent 3 England players to Brazil and the plane came back with 0.

Fuck I hope we sign some decent talent and beat Liverpool again this year.

true,mushroomgodmat,null,null,"&gt;The roads are first and foremost made for cars and other fast-moving vehicles. That does not include cyclists

I sorta accept that's an attitude many have. And that's brought on by a particularly car centric society - which has resulted in cyclists being scared off the roads which further perpetuates the idea that they don't belong. Not all nations are like us in that regard.

I do take issue with it though. Because although that's how it seems the road is a public place, that pedestrians use as well as cyclists. The rules and concepts behind that have been in place since the 1st roads, and are mentioned multiple times in the highway code, which of course is something every driver should know....but as you sorta illustrate its often forgotten.

&gt;Cyclists do pose as a hazard to motorists in a number of situations because ultimately you have to overtake them 

Well, you don't....this also illustrates a problem with attitudes. Its seen as an absolute need, a compulsion by some to get in front. Its a dangerous attitude. And again it goes against the HCs recommendation to only overtake only when its safe to do so.

Again I appreciate that's the general attitude by many, but I don't feel that's a good enough reason to put someone else in danger. Especially when that just results in having to stop at lights 20 seconds later and the cyclist just catches them up again.

&gt;This is why we need better cycling infrastructure to minimize the risks to both cyclists and motorists by building more more cycle lanes and routes in and outside of cities.

* although we don't know the details, the contract Suarez signed last year will have clarified exactly what the conditions are that could lead to a Suarez transfer.
* if another club meets the valuation laid out in that contract, Liverpool will sell. They essentially agreed to that when they offered the contract last season.
* if a lower offer comes in, Liverpool will consider it in the light of recent events and the fact that Suarez is on this bizarre punishment escalator that means his next transgression will likely see an even more absurd ban. But they only need to sell if they feel it's in the club's interest.
* all this talk of clubs ""preparing"", ""monitoring"" or ""bracing""is just blather to sell page impressions.
* Suarez will quite reasonably be doing whatever he can to improve his situation. If he feels he'd be better off at another club than Liverpool, even after last season, then he'll be angling for a move. Exactly the same as last summer.
* Suarez's agents and representatives will of course be stooping to new lows to try to get a move, because that's how they get paid. Wherever there is money, there are people who are willing to abandon dignity to get a slice of it. This will never change. What they're trying to do is to get FSG to blink first and get drawn into a disadvantageous deal. It's happened to previous Liverpool owners often enough, but FSG aren't going to fall for it. They're perfectly comfortable playing hardball and probably find it all a bit amateurish.
* at least it's not as embarrassing as the nonsense about Yaya Toure feeling unloved that comes out every summer.

However, I disagree with almost everything that's ever been written about this apology, including what Bascombe says here.

When Suarez bit Chiellini, it was nothing to do with Liverpool. So when he issued his apology without dragging Liverpool into it, that's the right thing to do. He's bitten a fellow and let his teammates and nation down. That's two things he needs to apologise for that are nothing to do with Liverpool, Barcelona or anyone else outside Uruguay and wherever Chiellini is right now (props to him, by the way, for his gracious and level-headed response to Luis's sentence).

An apology to Liverpool is forthcoming. There probably needs to be a public statement in that regard before the season starts. There's no rush for that, though.",0,1404216750,null,0,false,0,ciln9ev,t3_29jqxh,t1_ciln9ev,t1_cill0oa,null,1434496548,10,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,10

I don't remember how the dream started, whether everything was normal at first or if it began already into the disaster, but there was a huge creaking/crashing/rumbling and all the buildings were falling horizontally as the Earth had stopped spinning dead in its tracks, however the things on the surface still had momentum.

I was having to jump and leap constantly to avoid being hit by masonry, glass, cars, people, etc.
No idea how I survived but I remember particularly after it was over and climbing through all the wreckage of a destroyed city. Pretty awesome.

I fairly sure the dream's basis was a short story by H.G. Wells which I read many years ago, where a man gains the power to make anything he wishes happen. He uses faulty reasoning and thinking he can stop time by stopping the rotation of the earth, wishes it so with ~~hilarious~~ disastrous consequences. It's amazing what the mind comes up with in dreams and what things are remembered below the surface.

Precisely. 

Here's an example. http://www.womensaid.org.uk/domestic_violence_topic.asp?section=0001000100220036sionTitle=statistics

I realise it's ""womens aid"", but they deliberately try and make out that any statistic that says men are abused is flawed in some way. They use half the page to discredit male victims of abuse.

I was so angry I wrote them a letter, they have not replied.

I am so sick of having anything involving men thrown aside entirely because women may have a slightly higher probability of being a victim. It's like society considers women the priority and men will get a look in once every problem has been solved for women. 

Kind of like how we have numerous ""violence against women"" government departments etc. yet 2/3 of all violence is against a male victim. Kind of makes you think.

AVB did favour defensive tactics in the sense he would always protect the back line. This meant that we only had 4 players going forward trying to break through teams that parked the bus. However the reason we struggled to score was because when we tried to break them down we had players like Townsend and Lennon. The lack of service even broke Soldado! And AVB wouldn't risk bringing on new players who didn't know their defensive duties...

Most of the the Haas proposal on parades were fine however there were worded in such a way that would have allowed any single person, if they were so inclined, to stop any parade anywhere.

true,FRDUM_FOOF_SPETGH,newcr-1,Hungry Hungry Hibbo,"Call me cynical, but no.  I've ranted on the subject a few times on here, but the whole European football system is broken and only exists to benefit the top few clubs, which doesn't include us and won't for the foreseeable future.

The ultimate success of a club is dependent on money, that's just a fact unfortunately.  The richer clubs can all afford better players and in greater depth, and European football doesn't have the collective willpower or capability of imposing things like salary caps.  The gap can be reduced by good management (as we have had with Martinez and Moyes) but can't be closed completely.

Rich owners aside, the majority of these clubs' money comes from commercial sponsorships and TV rights.  The top teams get more of their matches aired on TV, [so get more in broadcasting payments](http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/news/2013-14/may/premier-league-broadcasting-commercial-payments.html).  In addition to these extra payments, [their increased exposure and profile allows them to demand more from their sponsors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_football_sponsorship#Summary_of_shirt_sponsorship_deals).  The top 4 teams also qualify for the misnamed Champions' League, which gives them even more money (through increased TV money and sponsorship money that accompanies it) and even further exposure throughout the world.

Everton can make inroads by playing good football, holding onto our star power (Barkley &amp; Howard in particular), and challenging the top teams, but without greater exposure in the media we will never have the same appeal to foreign fans as the clubs which they consistently see and hear about.

Gerrard excels more in the latter role than the former (hence why Jordan is relied on so much) and it might be that Jordan never gets as comfortable behind the microphone/in front of the camera as Stevie.

After a couple of months of that, he was the worst full-back in the world. Then after a couple of games in the front three, he was our best player again. It's hard to keep up.

I always thought it went: One tribe had it all. The other got uppity and still won't give over about stuff that happened 400 fucking years ago. Violence ensued. Got a bit out of hand for post-WWII white on white fighting. But the tactics of the conflict were sent around the world to fight brown people, or teach other terrorists how to fight states.

An agreement was made that when one tribe's population in six of the nine counties of the province of Ulster rose to a certain level there would be a referendum and if that referendum succeeded then no part of Ireland would be British any more. 

And when it occurs so much money and time and effort will be put into it by the Irish and the British states and the International Community that there is nothing Unionists here could do short of nuclear armament to make it fail. But there's no cultural war?


So all that information I gleaned throughout my life about the Northern Ireland problem isn't real? Fuck.

Yes...No....Maybe. I'm not sure what you mean by prescriptive/descriptive issue, but I'll take a guess. From OP:

&gt; I'm still waiting for everyone to realise that 'inception' means the establishment or starting point of an institution or activity, not simply layers.

OP implies the ""layers"" concept is not an accurate use of the term Inception, because OP believes inception means only establishment from a starting point of an institution or activity.

&gt; Just because some people on the internet made a silly meme about a film title then that means the definition of the word ""inception"" has changed?

Yes. Although I don't think it's changed away from OP's expected definition. More, the definition of Inception has been expanded to include the concept of layers. 

Sure, you may not find that definition in the dictionary yet (like you'll find OPs) but language was around well before dictionaries. Dictionaries and formal definitions are there to document a language. Language is not there to represent what's written in dictionaries or as other formal definitions, it's there for communication.

&gt; 
&gt; **It's important to stress that OP is not a redpill troll. He genuinely thought that he disagreed with redpill philosophy because he didn't understand it fully**. However, when he tried to express his personal opinions on sexual dynamics and what makes a relationship work, he inadvertently promoted core redpill theories.

Now that it's been shown to be a massive cock up and nothing but beneficial to the redpill sub, I think it's a fair prediction that the bluepill and feminist gilders and upvoters will try to save face by doing a 180, playing the victim card and calling OP out as a redpiller manipulating them into upvoting him just to draw attention to TRP.

I disagree, it's the way roads are layed out that causes traffic to flow in a non-bike friendly way.

Roads are designed to allow motor vehicles to travel at a speed that bikes can't match. Roundabouts in particular allow cars to flow without leaving space for slower traffic to merge into the flow.

There is often room for cars to overtake safely, but obstructions such as parked cars or crossing refuges narrow the road so the unofficial second lane disappears with little warning.

I don't disagree with this in theory, but they are currently designed and planned for cars and other motor vehicles; there's no two ways about it.

&gt;With more people choosing to cycle, their needs should be met.

Sure, I'm not arguing with that.

It's not nonsense. The fact that roads were here before cars is completely irrelevant. You design infrastructure based on current and future needs.

'Felt' being the key word here. Your mum's and my wife's feelings on the matter are obviously poles apart. It doesn't help us objectively assess anything as big as an entire nation's health service.

In every city I've lived in there are many roads where vehicle traffic is restricted and the surface is, for example, cobbles or bricks.

Too many people dismiss that there is any culture at all. When clearly there is actual cultures. 

Also the definition of ""unionism"" and that **somehow ""unionism is a culture"" is complete bullshit** and completely ignorant to the facts.  ""unionism"" is an idea, not a culture. Apart from that idea, that some do distinguish by declaring it ""pro-union"" there is no ""unionist culture"" at all. Unionism is only ONE very narrow idea.

The OO culture has issues.... needs addressed.

Regarding the causes behind the Iraq Invasion.... I think a lot has to do with the idealogical backgrounds of Bush and Blair- both held a neo-conservative mindset, believing that liberal-democracy is universal and could be spread by military force if necessary. After 9/11, I think they viewed radical Islamism as the antithesis of liberal-democracy, and I think that this gave them a strong motive to look into ways of spreading democracy and freedom more ""assertively"" in the Middle East. 

We won't know precisely why they decided on invading Iraq until their private telephone conversations are fully revealed. However I suspect a lot of it has to do with the political values of Bush and Blair, they wanted to forcefully impose democracy in the Middle East, probably to counter the threat of Islamism. 

Personally I think though that if you're going to do that, invading Iraq is probably one of the worst places to start. It was a country full of religious and ethnic divisions and only held together by the iron grip of Saddam Hussain. Remove him and his power structures and whole country goes to shit. I know I'm writing this with the benefit of hindsight, but you'd have thought that Bush and Blair might have learnt from the break up of Yugoslavia that ethnically/religiously divided countries break down into bloody chaos without the grip of a strong dictatorship. 

Given Bush's ""victory"" speech after the fall of Baghdad, I think they genuinely expected a nice short war were a wicked dictator is toppled and replaced by a democratic allied nation smack bang in the Middle East. America would also be able to demonstrate its military supremacy whilst giving the Iraqis good old freedom and democracy. Everyone would forget about the whole WMD justification because the war went so well, and the whole thing will be over and done with by Christmas.

Most of the time I don't use the cycle path as it's on the side towards the river and the big Tesco is on the other side (the only thing down there apart from the station that most people use regularly). I would use it if there were proper crossings without having to make a huge detour. It's easily possible to cross at the rail bridge and the station, but at Tesco it's quite a bit further down the road. So there's no point in using the cycle path. But that road is really scary. Even if you are riding as close to the roadside as possible you will still have loads of people going past you at speed and close enough to easily knock on their windows.

I hope it gets better though after they finish the Riverside. At least for longer distances it's alright in Dundee. Cycling along the river is better once you get out of the centre and the route through the port is alright (barring the bit where they ask you to dismount). Going south you've got the Tay Bridge which is alright with the only problems being the slope and the danger of it being closed due to high winds. Going north is the worst I think because you have to fight yourself through all the traffic and up some roads where you have to push your bike to get it up the hill.",0,1404227305,null,0,false,0,cilqswy,t3_29jphp,t1_cilqswy,t1_cilmboi,null,1434498491,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

This does not make it a liability. Cost is a choice. My car cost less than a lot of bikes do.

&gt;As long as you operate it it costs a fair amount of money.

All methods of transport cost money. And again, money is a choice. If people wish to spend their money on a mode of transport that is vastly superior for their personal requirements, then so be it.

&gt;The bulk of the time it sits about rusting.

This has nothing to do with anything. A bike sits around for most of the day too.

&gt;Most of the time most of the seats are empty.

So? Sometimes those seats are needed, sometimes they are not. You cannot have it both ways.

&gt;In cities, a cyclist is faster - and due to the difficulty in finding parking, can get you closer to your destination.

Most people do not live in city centres. In many, many applications a car is vastly quicker than any other mode of transport. My 25 mile commute for instance, going straight up and through a city takes 50 minutes in the car. It would take 2 1/2 hours via public transport, and about the same on a bike.

Sometimes one mode of transport is quicker, and sometimes another mode of transport is quicker. 

&gt;In the cases where a vehicle is required, it makes a lot more sense to pool resources and have large shared cars.

Many people do pool resources and share trips. That should be encouraged. Doesn't mean you need to get rid of cars.

&gt;Hey, we could call them buses.

Buses, are very slow, not nearly as practical as cars, and don't go everywhere.

Very useful in many situations, but so is a car.

&gt;Global politics has been warped by the need for oil - and we piss it away on 2 mile trips to the shops.

This has nothing to do with global politics. This is entirely to do with the fact that a 2 mile trip to the shops is faster, more convenient and more comfortable than walking or cycling.

true,eldudovic,lfc55,,"This is what I've been thinking too. People say that our team would be strengthened by adding Markovic and Sanchez rather than weakened. Fact is that Suarez takes up one place in the starting 11 while Markovic and Sanchez take up two.

On the other hand we have Sturridge. I'm not too afraid of losing Suarez since we already have a great striker waiting in the wings. Compared to spurs who had noone who could replace Bale. Maybe if we could bring in players of actual top quality to add to our squad we could improve. We'd lose the moments of brilliance that Suarez adds, but instead we might be able to keep up our intense pressing game and dominate teams until the 90th minute. Last season our glaring weakness was not our back four in my opinion. It was that after the 60th minute we looked gassed. Our midfield and front three couldn't keep up the pressing game. That invited teams to attack and we couldn't control the game anymore because we had no players with the energy to string two passes together.

It's a gamble for sure though. With Suarez we know what we get. 90 minutes of tireless ferocity. Technique and ruthlessness. Moments of magic. He comes at the price of two world class players though. I would sell him only if we could manage to pick up Sanchez as part of the deal. Sanchez is not as good as Suarez, but he brings with him a similar set of skills. I'd sell him reluctantly. Liverpool is not going to be as enjoyable to watch without Suarez bending his head down and just pushing through defenders.

It shouldn't be too much of a problem for places that operate 24/7 because you simply hire more people and rearrange shifts. But for 9-5 office jobs that close at weekends, it could be problematic finding someone who only wants one day of work a week. 

And while it would be an initial boost to the employment figures, it would also pull a lot of workers back into the threshold to receive benefits. 40 hours a week at £8 an hour would put you over the earning threshold for most benefits, but 30 hours at £8 an hour means you're going to be claiming working tax credit, and housing and council tax benefit. 

A shorter working week would benefit many employers as they would reduce their employer contributions such as tax, NI, pension schemes, etc. but it would vastly increase the cost to the benefits bill as many more workers would now be eligible for benefits. 

The majority of working people already claim some kind of benefit, such working tax, child tax, housing or rent, etc. This would simply increase those numbers by around 20-25%

Without a huge change to the benefits bill and minimum wage, a 4 day week would end up being the government subsidising workers pay, as they currently do for millions of low wage workers.

true,JohnShit,eng-wiltshire,Wiltshire,"&gt;You've now agreed that it's not true, yet you still also seem to be claiming that it's sort of true.  

Oh please. The bit where I said ""this was false"" was a clue to me not thinking it was true. I have no idea what you're trying to achieve here.

&gt;Let me give you an analogy. If you asked ""is that red fruit there an apple?"", and I replied with ""No. An apple can only be green"", I would be wrong. The fact that an apple can be green is irrelevant.

Ok, let's bend the analogy so that it might actually work. In this hypothetical universe, apples can only be green or red, though until 1985 it was unclear whether they could be red. I am somehow only aware of the existence of green apples, red apples being much less common. Somebody says ""this is fruit! It must be an apple"". I say ""actually, it can't be an apple unless it's green"". You say ""are you sure? I can't see anything about greenness in the official description of apples"". I say ""yes and no, actually. The apple does have to be of a particular colour, but it seems that I was wrong about it only being able to be green. It can also be red"". You say ""then it is irrelevant that it could be green"" at great length until I lose the will to live.

Do you see how this is a massive waste of time? Do you see that, if apples must be green or red, it is wrong but *not entirely irrelevant* to say that apples must be green, especially when a significant part of my purpose in saying that was to point out that apples can't be of any colour whatsoever?

I'm guessing probably not.

As for the ""might have affected the outcome"" part, I suspect that you weren't able to read Millward because, while your definition is one perfectly reasonable interpretation of what I said, it doesn't reflect the law as it currently is.

Firstly, a concession: you're right that it isn't a question of the select committee member necessarily relying on the statement, because it is for the perjury trial judge to determine whether the statement was material, not the select committee members. That was a mistake (N.B. this means that it was false, I am not claiming it was true, please shut up). So yes, consequently, it is significant whether the statement *might* have been relied on, but don't interpret this too widely. The judge in Millward, in rejecting the defence's argument that only a statement that *would* affect the outcome could be material (which was based on [the only statutory definition for materiality](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Edw7/6/41/section/18)), affirmed the following test from R v Lavey:

""...on the question, whether what she falsely swore was material or not, you will consider whether her evidence in this respect might not influence the mind of the judge of the County Court in believing or disbelieving the other statements she made in giving her evidence...""  

From that, it isn't just ""might have affected the outcome in any way whatsoever"" but in that particular way. This is clarified in Millward itself, in which this is the basis for judging the statements that were made as material:

""...the lies told effectively brought to a halt that line of cross-examination, which undoubtedly went to the heart of the case [...] The fact that further cross-examination was prevented might very well, it is clear, have affected the outcome of the case.""

So we know that a false statement will be considered material if it is to that individual's credit (see also The Queen v. Baker - ""all false statements wilfully and corruptly made by a witness as to matters which affect his credit are material""), and we know that it will also be considered material if it is possible that it shut down a line of questioning which might have led to a different outcome.

It's *possible* that, in a future case, a false statement which *might* have (but didn't) shut down a line of questioning that *might* have led to a different outcome could be considered material, but as yet we have no authority for that. Hopefully you can see the distinction between the two ""mights"" and which one Millward actually addressed. ""It is possible that it did, but we needn't concern ourselves with establishing whether it definitely did"" is different from ""it could have, but we know that it didn't"". Millward established that the former was valid, not the latter.

That's really it. To apply it to your latest example of a criminal trial, it is not perjury ""regardless of whether anyone believed me"". After Millward, it will be material if we don't know whether anybody involved relied on your statement but it is possible that they did. There is currently no authority that says that it will be material if it is clear that nobody relied on your statement but it was possible that they could have. That remains to be seen.",0,1404229299,null,0,false,0,cilrpe6,t3_29etc0,t1_cilrpe6,t1_cil3cll,null,1434499228,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Now, 

Why is James Rodriguez unproven ? 

I do understand that a player playing well in the world cup, might not be that good in Leagues. But let's look at his stats.
He played for FC Porto and was their Best Player and Golden Ball winner in the Portuguese League. He then transferred to Monaco and was in the Ligue XI too. He has played consistently at a consistently high level throughout his career, and by that i mean Age 22. 
And now, his performance in the World Cup is electric too. Only scored 10 goals ? 
Now, Sanchez and Rodriguez are different players. Out of the two, Rodriguez is more like Suarez. And i meant, like for like replacement, albeit a younger one. 
Sanchez might be the better player, but is he the player we need ?

Defensive Midfielder ? Yeah i agree, easier said then done. But seeing the number of matches Liverpool are gonna play, i would like someone like Ilori or Rossiter to play in Cup matches.

Right Footed Central defender is irrelevant ?? Defenders should be good with both feet. Yeah, but they are not. And the ones we have are definitely not, apart from Agger and Toure to an extent. 
Let me ask you, If Skrtel missed a Premier league match, whom do you think Brendan Rodgers will play ? Agger and Sakho both ? NO. He'll play Kolo Toure.

scabs you mean. those who refuse to go on strike aren't neutral, but on the side of capital and the state in there aggressive attack on workers, you can't be neutral on a moving train. If someone refuses you the right to live, you take it. I love how the ideology of capital is sooo ingrained into every aspect of our social conscious from birth that is seems alien that workers should actually have any say over their own work or the job that fills their lives, it's projected as self-evident that capital should control and dominate every aspect of our lives and determine our freedom and life itself. When workers even attempt to express their individualism or right to control their own lives and make the decisions affecting them themselves, we have the trained sputter of disbelief. The class struggle never ends and endlessly pits labour and capital to which the state inherently sides with capital and will crush those who don't fall in line. The disputes in the 1970s and 80s were but another revolution in the logic of capital. The activity of labour forced evolutions in capital; globalisation, the emergence of the social factory, and immaterial labour, and the rise of neoliberal hegemony and the most powerful union of capital and state yet in a quasi-fascist new order (quasi-fascist in the sense that our society is proclaimed to be 'post-class'/'classless' or at least a truce between the classes as all work together in a 'national interest', of course there's no national only class interests and capitalist society can never, despite how much it preaches so, deny or end the class struggle (it only means that one side is so completely dominating there rule appears natural)).

He doesn't want a formal tenancy because he doesn't have consent to let from his mortgage lender, in some cases if his lender finds out he's letting without permission they will recall the mortgage which can result in you being evicted. If he can't get consent to let it's probably for a good reason, he might even be with a lender that is *trying* to cancel all mortgages (I believe Northern Rock is one such lender). This is *even worse* because it would appear he's operating an HMO, which has even more regulations, depending on the local council he could be in even more trouble. 

There's no such thing as a ""formal tenancy"" anyway, a tenancy is created just by you moving in to the property, whether there's a paper contract or just a verbal agreement doesn't matter, a tenancy is a tenancy. Regardless of your ""deposit"" being stolen (which is entirely possible, this is a common scam) he's trying to do *bad* things, don't get yourself mixed up in it. I've had a landlord breaking his mortgage terms before, it was not a pleasant experience, I spent a good few weeks expecting eviction when the lender found out.

If you must do this then expect for bad things to happen and don't give him the deposit until you get the keys, the fact that he's making it so easy for you (""oh don't worry, you can just not pay for the last month!"") should be a warning sign.

I mean market efficiencies like reducing the price of a barrel of oil by a factor of twelve due to moving it in tankers, like Rockefeller did, thus making cars more affordable for everyone, not to mention reducing the cost of transporting other products. Or to take a more recent example, Amazon reducing the price of just about everything by cutting out the overheads of brick and mortar stores, thus meaning we can buy a book for half its RRP.

&gt; It was obvious I meant a human cost. The rich get richer and the poor get called shirkers and scroungers.

The richest man today will not be able to afford what the poorest man in a hundred years will take for granted, and that is because of capitalism.

&gt;

&gt;In [optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics), particularly as it relates to [film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film) and [photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography), __depth of field__ (__DOF__) is the distance between the nearest and farthest objects in a scene that appear acceptably sharp in an image. Although a [lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics\)) can precisely [focus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(optics\)) at only one distance at a time, the decrease in sharpness is gradual on each side of the focused distance, so that within the DOF, the unsharpness is imperceptible under normal viewing conditions.

&gt;In some cases, it may be desirable to have the entire image sharp, and a large DOF is appropriate. In other cases, a small DOF may be more effective, emphasizing the subject while de-emphasizing the foreground and background. In [cinematography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematography), a large DOF is often called [deep focus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_focus), and a small DOF is often called [shallow focus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shallow_focus).

At games QPR fans, mostly, fail to show nearly enough support for the team.

I often cringed at the flack Fernandes would get from our fans on Twitter. 
Admittedly he's made very big mistakes,  but there are times and places for that kind of thing.

I also dislike seeing our fans firing insults at fans of other clubs on social media.  It really makes us look s**t.

We had to do it on our shoe department after Christmas because we physically couldn't put sale shoes out due to all the customers crowding around us, digging through the boxes and just helping themselves to shit in our cupboards. Nevermind being annoying bastards, they made the whole environment really unsafe.

Boots closed off whole aisles last year while they wheeled in the Soap &amp; Glory half price gift sets out in cages, I felt awful for the staff, they were begging and/or screaming at customers to move out of the way so they can unload the goods but people just stood there blocking the way. They tried asking them to form a queue so they could hand them out one at a time, one per customer instead of trying to fill a shelf but it caused too much drama. Customers just helped themselves and shoved each other, big gift sets went flying through the air as people chucked them to their mates, it was ridiculous. I know a cage is a simple hardly dangerous object but customers can't just go playing around with them for 'elf &amp; safety reasons, it only takes one idiot to trap their fingers or wheel over their toes and blame us for it.

* Belfast (13), Edinburgh (14), Middlesbrough (17) are all a long way from the planned HS2 network.
* Brighton/Worthing/Littlehampton (15), Bournemouth/Poole (18) will also see benefits from CrossRail 2.
* Leicester (16) is relatively close to Nottingham-Derby.
* Stoke (20) isn't all that far from a number of HS2 stations.

Perhaps the most obvious addition is a phase 3 that goes north from Leeds to Middlesbrough, Newcastle-Sunderland, Edinburgh, and Glasgow, but that's a lot of track for not all that many people.",0,1404234993,null,0,false,0,cilukkd,t3_29k7cn,t1_cilukkd,t1_cils43p,null,1434500994,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

""As my Dad pointed out;

Poch really only inherited Adkins teams mostly, with the exception of Lovren, and Wanyama who was injured half the season, he worked with those players to make them the best to his ability.

And what I took from it;

Now Koeman, has the chance to fill in 3 players that he likes, + anymore for squad depth/better replacements, that he will know and can build the team he wants around. We should still be an appealing team to watch, we've lost 3 players so far, our Captain, who barely seemed interested the moment someone was interested in him, an 18 year old who isn't the best LB (yet) and was prone to mistakes/not the best decision making, and Lambert who desperately needed to be an impact sub last season let alone upcoming one, but we lacked the depth of a better striker. We haven't in fairness lost much, we still currently own our CDM's, 3 back players, Stevie D/Ramirez/Prowse/JRod and then add on whoever else we bring in, i'm really not worried at all. We have the money to bring in better players in all those positions, the downside is now just how long it takes them to settle, or will they flop.""

As to how Lallana has left, everyone else has pretty much summed it up, got a picture with him downstairs that I may have to put down for a while, I feel the reception difference between him and Lambert when they come to St Mary's will be vastly different.

Had no qualms with Lambert going, was chuffed for the guy, Shaw not too much either, the money he is being paid is insane, he is 18 and can build his career where he'd like, and wish him the best, they both gave adequate thanks to the club, and you know we'll always have a place in them.

""The Sound Of Silence""


 Hello darkness, my old friend,
 I've come to talk with you again,
 Because a vision softly creeping,
 Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
 And the vision that was planted in my brain
 Still remains
 Within the sound of silence.
 
In restless dreams I walked alone
 Narrow streets of cobblestone,
 'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
 I turned my collar to the cold and damp
 When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
 That split the night
 And touched the sound of silence.
 
And in the naked light I saw
 Ten thousand people, maybe more.
 People talking without speaking,
 People hearing without listening,
 People writing songs that voices never share
 And no one dared
 Disturb the sound of silence.
 
""Fools,"" said I, ""You do not know –
 Silence like a cancer grows.
 Hear my words that I might teach you.
 Take my arms that I might reach you.""
 But my words like silent raindrops fell
 And echoed in the wells of silence
 
And the people bowed and prayed
 To the neon god they made.
 And the sign flashed out its warning
 In the words that it was forming.
 And the sign said, The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
 And tenement halls
 And whispered in the sound of silence. ",0,1404236619,null,0,false,0,cilvg2q,t3_29jto4,t1_cilvg2q,t1_cilu1d5,null,1435484524,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

Well, you're (mostly) wrong there.

You may have misinterpreted one of the prohibitions: the horn must not be used when stationary, except in an emergency.

Whether or not Mr Focus RS is using it correctly when slowly accelerating behind you is debatable. It's probably not within the spirit of the code, but it is within the letter.

I've pre-emptively sounded my motorcycle's horn approaching a junction when I'm worried that someone else hasn't seen me. As far as I'm concerned, that's a perfectly correct use of the horn.

Also, you would likely run afoul of [Rule 169](https://www.gov.uk/using-the-road-159-to-203/overtaking-162-to-169), were you to attempt to stop traffic.

true,chochazel,null,null,"&gt;So we are back to my point that not drawing on the NHS is a matter of age and being a parent, which means the net contribution is lost as an immigrant gets older unless they are a big earner.

We're trying to explain an imminent collapse. Also being net contributors to health insurance is *far* more common than you seem to imagine - most people are net contributors, including parents - it's a minority who draw most of the resources, and the fact that immigrants come at working age, without having themselves been drawing on resources as children, and *more likely than the general population* to go home before retirement, means that they will be more likely to be net lifetime contributors.

&gt;And my definition of externalities is correct. Declaring otherwise does not make you right.

Likewise.  Externalities are not fixed costs! they are costs or benefits which affect a third party who did not choose to incur those costs or benefits (e.g. the pollution caused by a factory affecting the farm upstream).  The costs involved in paying out on an insurance scheme to the people who pay into it are not in any way external costs!

What a lot of people fail to understand, since they don't cycle and can only view the road from their metal box is that there is a lot of ""cycling infrastructure"" in this country which is unusable.  

But it's the language of the typical bad driver that gets to me:

There is zero evidence to support the case that our disarmament would persuade other countries to abandon their own weapons, nor would it dissuade others from seeking them. 



The UK is a stable, fully functioning democracy that has no extremist tendencies. Removing them would likely make it a less safer world as the balance of power tips towards those countries that have or are seeking to have nuclear weapons that aren't as stable.

true,JackXDark,null,null,"The Tories are being driven by the concept of '[nudge theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory)'. 

They want to privatise the NHS. They want to remove the welfare state. They want to open education to private profit-making interests. They want to reshape infrastructure for businesses' needs, not people's needs. They won't do these things outright. Yet.

What they will do is make things in the NHS worse. But just a little bit. By setting impossible targets and cutting resources. Whilst bringing in some private services in some areas that are quite good, but subsidised by slack in other areas. They bloke on /r/Britishproblems that recently made a post about his cheese board in a private hospital that was offering an NHS service. That's a nudge too.

They'll make it utterly shaming and stigmatising and inconvenient to claim any sort of benefit so that going into the grey economy or relying on family or sofas-surfing and sponging off friends and letting the CCJs mount up is actually preferable to being told to move to a city you've never been to, for a job with no prospects that means you don't see daylight for six months a year.

On their own, each 'nudge' is perhaps reasonable and justifiable. As policy, it adds up to a massive and wholesale ideological restructuring of the nation, with many, many lives being ruined along the way.

Each nudge is not quite enough to protest about en masse. Yes, there are protests about some policy changes, but because these are nudges and moderately small steps each time and not outright impositions of huge change, protesters can be marginalised as concerned with small elements of single issues. Or if they turn nasty, well, there are water cannons now.

Tony Blair and New Labour believed in what they were doing. They had a (slightly crazed and messianic) vision, but at least were fairly open about that and thought they were at least helping people. John Major believed in balancing the books at any cost, but he did at least try to do that. Thatcher believed in having a massive pool of available labour that was cheap and willing to work, and at least also saw that they had just enough to live on, without having to jump through too many hoops. This went wrong occasionally, such as with the miner's strike and the poll tax, when people didn't go along with her changes, but there was at least an honesty to her actions there, which was just outright nasty rather than trying to make it all happen without anyone noticing, as the modern Tories are doing with their nudges.

The Tories now, believe in profit for people that look like them, or who can pay and influence them. They're not elitist, because they don't actually believe in excellence above all else, rather they're exclusionary and will vilify anyone that doesn't accept their nudges. That's part of it.

They're nasty because they're selfish and self-serving and socially xenophobic and they're much worse than just nasty because they've now hit on a tactic that works whilst killing people. But not quite enough people in one go for it to be seen as a problem.

Fuck nudge theory. And fuck nudge policies. Don't vote for this shit, please.

Pros: Adorable part-furnished flat, ten minutes from everything. Private let with a friendly landlord. As the flat is being tidied up prior to letting, there'd be a reduction in price. (Also, you have the whole top floor of the building, so can play music to your heart's content!)

To expand upon my disagreement (if you were curious), I think our identity was clearly defined in how we played against bigger squads. I would consider it a mistake to base any top squad off of how to beat lower-tier clubs as opposed to elite opponents, especially if one or two specific sorts of players could be inserted into our lineup to help in unlocking those lower-tier clubs to achieve better results. The fact that we played against lower-tier clubs in more games last season is irrelevant to the club we were, which was defined as back to front, having the best defense in the league and using that to press forward.

From Wikipedia:

&gt; In August 2013 Harris was again arrested by Operation Yewtree officers and charged with nine counts of indecent assault dating to the 1980s, involving two girls between 14 and 16 years

Costa started football relatively late. 
At his age he has less then 300 appearances which is very little. Drogba had 180 and he started very late, torres had played around 100 games or 2 extra seasons worth of football at same age. That's so I expect maybe 6 years of good ability from Costa before he starts becoming worse. 
He also spent half a season on loan where he scored 10 in 16 as a striker, a return similar to his season last season in terms of percentages. Plus when played in domestic cup during falcao time he got more chances as a striker and performed well.
Can't see him scoring same levels because atletico is very reliant on their strikers to score compared to the other players on the field. But I'm saying 15 goals in league wouldn't surprise me.

You either get a cash ISA (which currently have poor interest rates), or a stock &amp; shares ISA, which you can then invest into as you please (for a possibly greater gain, or not).

I don't think anyone would disagree that protecting your savings from tax is a bad thing.

The problem comes when you want a greater return than a cash ISA, without the risk of investing in the market via a stocks &amp; shares ISA. Now we're talking about fancy accounts like the Santander 123, and various deals where you lock your money away for 12 months to get 3%, and all that jazz. Even taking into account tax, you can still get a better return than a cash ISA if you go in for one of those. 

But most of these special deals have amount limits on them - £300 p/m, or a flat £2.5K, for example. If you've got £25K, and want to try for greater returns than a cash ISA, you're looking at a stocks &amp; shares ISA.

Furthermore, even if you don't want to get into stocks &amp; shares because it's too risky, you _still_ probably want to whack your money into an ISA.

But your claim that ""it's still valid"" suggests that you still think it's valid, which it isn't.

&gt;It can also be red"". You say ""then it is irrelevant that it could be green"" at great length until I lose the will to live.

If you're losing the will to live, feel free to stop replying.

&gt;Do you see that, if apples must be green or red, it is wrong but not entirely irrelevant to say that apples must be green,

But it *is* entirely irrelevant in a discussion about a red fruit - or in this case, "" a statement that might have affected the outcome of the proceedings,"". 

&gt;Hopefully you can see the distinction between the two ""mights"" and which one Millward actually addressed. ""It is possible that it did, but we needn't concern ourselves with establishing whether it definitely did"" is different from ""it could have, but we know that it didn't"". Millward established that the former was valid, not the latter.

Apologies if I'm misunderstanding, but your argument seems to be based entirely around the fact that a couple of specific judges only mentioned a couple of specific reason why something could be considered perjury, and that therefore this excluded other possible reasons. If so, I'm really not sure I follow your logic. Do you instead have any judges stating that deliberately lying by admitting guilt wouldn't be perjury? It's quite clear that a guilty plea *might* affect the outcome of a trial. Take Vicky Pryce for example, who was found guilty of perverting the course of justice for pretending to be guilty of Chris Huhne's speeding ticket. What's that got to do with perjury, you may ask? The [SFO](http://www.sfo.gov.uk/media/103061/perjury%20web%201.pdf) has the answer - ""In most cases, perjury will often amount to perverting the course of justice. It is appropriate to charge with perjury if the perjury is the sole or principal act. If however it is part of a more significant series with the aim of perverting justice, perverting the course of justice will be the more appropriate charge.""

So, we have established that lying about being guilty of a crime can be seen as material, and that if done with the specific intent of perverting the course of justice you can be charged with that. So where is your evidence that lying about being guilty but without there being enough evidence that you were intentionally trying to pervert the course of justice would somehow be seen as not material?",0,1404247479,null,0,false,0,cim13pm,t3_29etc0,t1_cim13pm,t1_cilrpe6,null,1434504315,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,UncleArthur,null,null,"From a Stocks and Shares ISA perspective, it depends.

If you're investing a modest amount in equities and are a Basic Rate Taxpayer, it is arguable that an ISA gives you nothing. The income will be from dividends, and the ISA wrapper doesn't avoid you suffering 10% tax on those. Similarly, although any gains are shielded from Capital Gains Tax when you sell, you already have a CGT Exemption of £11,000; so as long as your gains in any one Tax Year are less than this, you've gained nothing by using an ISA.

If you're using a Stocks and Shares ISA to invest in corporate bonds and Gilts, it's another story. Such investments normally provide little capital growth, so the CGT aspect is as per equities - barely worthwhile - as most of the growth comes from re-investment of the ISA income. However, all this ISA income is classed as Savings income, and the ISA Manager can reclaim the Income Tax paid at source on this income, saving you 20% Income Tax.

If you are a Higher Rate or an Additional Rate taxpayer, the tax wrapper advantages of a Stocks and Shares ISA are significant. If, on the other hand, you are a non-taxpayer, they are almost non-existent.

For Cash ISAs, if you can find a higher net interest rate from a normal savings account when compared to the tax-free ISA rate, then go for the former every time.

true,Seismica,cnty-uk,Teesside,"&gt; We already have issues with this in situations where cycle lanes are already in place. 

Cycle lanes on the road are just inadequate, and actually narrow the road for all users as cyclists have to move into the 'car lane'. 

&gt;What we really need is segregation and a separate infrastructure for cyclists - something many cyclists do agree on. That could be mean widening roads to find space or closing some roads off to cars completely and making them arterial cycling routes. 

This is the best solution. Let's stop trying to divide the road into pieces and just put a full lane for cyclists to use, completely seperate from the road like [this](http://www.hembrow.eu/studytour/10-nl.jpg). 

In places where the road is narrow you can have a shared use cycle/pedestrian lane. In places where that genuinely wouldn't fit, then the cyclist can use the road, but you're talking small villages where it's already single lane traffic with no footpath. Where full cycle lanes can't be accomodated for next to the route, provide an alternative route (bypass) for those who are just cycling through the area.

Currently I don't use my Bike for travel because there is no infrastructure. The National Cycle Network is a gravel/mud path that seems to stop randomly in places, sometimes in the middle of the countryside, or when it connects to a 70mph A-road. Shared cycle paths within towns and cities (That are seperate from roads) have moving obstacles in the form of pedistrians, and also static barriers designed to prevent motorbikes, but which cause me to have to get off my bike and lift it up every couple of hundred metres. It's a complete shambles. The bottom line is that it's so inconvenient, I'd rather drive.",0,1404248130,null,0,1404259653,0,cim1fon,t3_29jphp,t1_cim1fon,t1_cilnk0l,null,1434504533,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

For example if you are saving for a house deposit in one year the decisions you make are **vastly** different from if you're saving towards your retirement.

I've heard Paul Finney complain on occasion on the podcast that the club doesn't advertise enough with billboards etc, but to be honest I don't think there's enough vacant seating at Loftus Road, especially in the Prem, to justify spending money on marketing like that. Fernandes might be onto a better bet trying to chase down the global TV audience, as with the Park signing. Obviously the problem with that, as we've seen, is that you need to maintain PL status to maintain that strategy. I also doubt being top flight is enough to give you appeal - I don't imagine Stoke or West Brom have snowballed a critical mass of supporters in Africa or the Far East.

I read a book a while back (Soccernomics) that said there's decent evidence showing improved stadium comfort definitely increases attendances. As you say, Loftus Road has its charms, but trying to spark a deeper relationship with potential matchday fans by asking them to pay 50 quid for the leg room, the pillar-obstructed views and the crowded hospitality is a bit of a stretch. So I suppose a new stadium will finally give the club a better product to sell, and the increased capacity will hopefully allow them to play around with pricing more.

On the whole I just wish more people would get behind the team because it's their local club though. English football isn't the dark world of the '70s and '80s any more.

Travelling at 140mph is only about 10% faster than 125mph. So lets assume it reduces the journey time by 10%, that means they'll only take 72 minutes.

Of course reducing the journey time by 10% is a ridiculous assumption, the train is only travelling 10% faster along stretches where it was previous limited to 125mph, and even in these stretches it has to accelerate to and decelerate.

So we know it will have to take more than 72 minutes.

&gt;The __Can-can__ (sometimes non-hyphenated as in the original French: __cancan__ French pronunciation: ​[kɑ̃kɑ̃]) is a high-energy and physically demanding [music hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_hall) dance, traditionally performed by a [chorus line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorus_line) of female dancers who wear costumes with long skirts, [petticoats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petticoat), and black stockings. The main features of the dance are the lifting and manipulation of the skirts, with [high kicking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_ballet_terms#Battement) and suggestive, provocative body movements. The *Infernal Galop* from [Jacques Offenbach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Offenbach)'s *[Orpheus in the Underworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orpheus_in_the_Underworld)* is the tune most associated with the can-can.

Yeah, but also very expensive, possibly overkill in a very literal sense, and those subs can't really do any other jobs.

A rotating schedule of nuclear patrols would bring investment to other areas of the armed forces and would be just as effective politically, and there could still be a nuclear armed sub at sea at all times, just with stealthy cruise missiles, not ICBMs. No, they've not got the range or power of ICBMs, but they're still enough of a second strike capability to be an effective deterrent.
