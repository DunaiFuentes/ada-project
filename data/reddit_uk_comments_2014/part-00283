false,Jelly_Jim,null,null,"This was the trend for a few decades, but since the 2000s it's changed to city locations - Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow, Gateshead. Brighton is the only seaside location for a party conference in recent years, although the TUC still goes to Bournemouth.

Historically, seaside locations were chosen for their venues and large numbers of guest accommodation (typically guest houses, B&amp;Bs and hotels). The latter was important, because most delegates of party conferences were party members who needed somewhere affordable to stay. Seaside town accommodation was ideal for that.

Party conference security changed in the 1980s, becoming much more intense. Places like Blackpool had the conference venue and party leadership hotel in separate locations, around half a mile apart, which created additional security improvisations and logistical issues. The cost of security - not entirely borne by the taxpayer - is a consideration.

More recently, the kind of people who attend party conferences has changed. Whereas most delegates of earlier conferences used to be party members, modern attendees are often media, policy-making and public affairs people (whose job it is to talk to politicians and develop or influence party policies). Their accommodation and dining is usually a professional expense paid for by their employer, so the kind of hotel they expect to stay at and the restaurants they want to eat in are quite different to what is on offer at a seaside resort (perhaps except for Brighton). Blackpool is just *knackered*, basically. At the last party conference to be held there, complaints about accommodation were rife; the conference facilities are dated; the experience was treated like a bad joke by London-centric attendees.

The cost of a modern conference for party members can be off-putting for all but the most dedicated: £50-£150 for a pass; peak room rates for three or four nights' accommodation; several meals a day and drinks in the evening, and then transport to and from the conference - it can be equivalent to the cost of a holiday. The change in delegate means that a return to seaside towns is unlikely.

Cosmopolitan city centres are much more attractive places to be, for the parties and for their delegates. They offer modern, self-contained and secure conference venues, with a good range of quality accommodation and leisure in the area. Not to mention, transport links are much more convenient (Blackpool's railway is yet to be electrified and does not yet have a direct link to London).

From a seaside resident's perspective, party conferences were an inconvenience, with mutterings about the cost of security always looming. ",0,1411611516,null,0,false,0,ckrtpqz,t3_2h5lj9,t1_ckrtpqz,t3_2h5lj9,null,1426835966,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

Aspas was cheap cover in a season without many games. It was worth a try. There's no reason not to take a chance every now and then. Coutinho, for instance, was also a gamble for around the same price. You win some and lose some.

false,DahhKid,null,null,"If you look at Suarez for a slew of last years games he was making those runs in the channels and helping to create as well as put them away. He'd go out to the byline and also came into the midfield to receive and help give support in order to link up. Now I don't know if this is right or wrong as there are not truly right or wrong ways to try to play football. I may not like long balls over the top or the way Stoke used to play by knocking in crosses but a wins a win. 

Now my biggest issue with this all is the lack of communication and vindication with which our midfield works with Mario. When he goes out wide to collect, there are not runs being made through the middle by others due to what I believe to be the fear of allowing a speedy counter against a slowing Gerrard and our rather high and aggressive line our CBs have been playing. This d line does drop back to allow mids to come back and support but again, Stevie's legs really don't allow that to happen especially if he's tightly man marked which makes the counter even harder for us to handle. 

Not only that, but our refusal to place players around the ball and crowd an area to allow our extremely technical players for me is the only true issue. We are way too spaced out while trying to find that killer 1-2 pass/decisive through ball to be played to a runner coming into the box which is something that teams like Arsenal and City don't do. I'd love to see our wing backs to get more central based off which side the play is, allowing more of a crowding and quick passes to help exploit our quick midfielders pace. 

It also seems were too happy to recycle possession rather than just hold the ball in a dangerous area, look up, turn towards goal, and make a through pass to Moreno/Manquillo who are making runs into the ""channels"" created via runs pulling defenders away from these areas.

false,unemployed_employee,null,null,"I know I am coming in late, but here's my take on the day's event.

Our performance was atrocious. We may have won, but I feel we didn't nearly enough. It could be down to the lack of good understanding from the players on the pitch, but individual performances were generally poor.

Let's start with our defence. Shaky. Uncomfortable. We conceded from the most basic of set pieces, and it was a failure to man mark that allowed Bolton to score. In open play, we see again that our defence was incapable to handling small, fast players. How many times did we see Beckford getting the better of Cahill? At times, there was such a huge hole between midfield and defence that it nearly gave me a heart attack. A positive note, though, was that Felipe Luis was able and willing to cover the entire left side. I see Ashley Cole in him.

Midfield. Oh god. I was most angry at these bunch. No penetration whatsoever. Movement was lacking and all attacking players had their own plans. Oscar was not inspiring aside from the goal. I cannot recall any dangerous passes from him within 90 minutes. Salah was ineffectual with his penchant to go sideways whenever he sees a man. As a winger, the inability to go past a man means he was dead weight. Schurrle tried, I know he did, but all he did was waste chances and he struggled on the left. The only thing he saw whenever he came close to the 18-yard box was the goal even if there were better options on the right. Mikel? At fault for goal, misplaced forward passes, rusty. However, from my fiery eyes, I saw a glimpse of the future. Ake was calm and composed even under pressure. He was helped by a good range of passing and even his long balls were accurate. He was the only light I saw from the appalling display from our midfield.

Now we come to Remy. I was watching the screen and asking myself: where the fuck is Remy? Left? Right? Centre? I know playing a sole striker means you have to move around to find space and create space for your teammates, but he did neither. His moving around didn't help find space for our attacking midfield, but the fact that the midfield wasn't mobile at all didn't help. There was no threat in the middle whenever he moved out wide. I recall seeing crossing flying in the box without anyone receiving it. Whenever Remy tried to go through the centre, he was muscled off the ball too easily. He needs a lot of work on his physique to continue playing in that position. 

I know Bolton was playing very deep, but I saw options to unlock them. Our players merely didn't take it because they were too absorbed in their own game or they didn't have the ability. In a game like this, we shouldn't need Hazard or Matic to help draw the curtains. We should have put this game to bed in 60 minutes, but we toiled for the entire 90. It was poor and some of the players out there need a lot of improvement if they are to stake a starting spot.",0,1411614173,null,0,false,0,ckruy2u,t3_2hd5bi,t1_ckruy2u,t3_2hd5bi,null,1426835321,4,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,4

Clearly the government isn't as broke as you are telling me because they can afford to pay this £2,500 per head per month to companies like [scammer I was sent to] and eat the increase to my JSA without issue.

Give US the money.  Give us that two grand a month for six months because everyone I have spoken to has issues that you [the DSS/DWP] can't deal with and don't offer solutions for but can be solved with a short but massive injection of money in to their lives.

We have the best manager in the world in Mourinho.
We have Diego the motherfucker Costa
We have Cesc Fábregas who plays like a video game and hits the incredibly overpowered lobbed through ball.
We have Andre Schürrle, a World Cup winner who was arguably Germany's best player in the tournament.
We have Thibaut Courtois, the second best goalkeeper in the world second only to God damn Neuer.
We have Nemanja Matic, a beast, a tank, and a general of the midfield.
We have John Terry and Gary Cahill, the best CB pairing in the league.
We have Dave. Nobody gets past Dave one on one.
We've got our lovable Serb, a fullback, a midfielder, and a striker all in one.
We have Felipe Luis, one of the best LB's in the world last year who apparently can cross the ball wherever the hell he wants.
Jesus Christ we have Eden Hazard, a future Balon d'Or winner who is one of the most amazing players I've ever seen.
We have a bench that if it were its own team, would do pretty fucking well in the Premier League.

To become a London taxi driver, you have to do 'the knowledge'. This involves having your character assessed by the public carriage office, and learning by heart every street within a 6 mile radius of the centre of London. This process usually takes 2-4 years. If you see a scooter driving round London with a clipboard attachment, it will most likely be a 'knowledge boy' - a taxi driver in training learning routes and landmarks. A taxi is the only vehicle which can be flagged down in the street and cannot refuse a fare if the destination is in London. The meter rate is regulated and standard.

A mini cab must be pre-booked.  The driver has to have a basic criminal record check. The driver may not know where he is going and can refuse to take you if he doesn't want to go there. The fare is whatever he wants to charge.

Uber drivers, I have no idea about the regulation of the driver. The fare is pre calculated. I assume the drivers can reject fares.

Then we had twin injuries to Carra and Toure and Skrtel playing became necessary.

As we know he was imperious in the few games he got, despite everything having one player willing to take risks and be aggressive actually helped us rather than hinder us, and with BR's new 4-3-3 rolling out, Skrtel carved himself a spot in that back-line.

HMRC penalties for incorrect returns are based upon the behaviour behind the mistake and reduced if you voluntarily disclose the error and are helpful and cooperative during the enquiry, and can even get reduced down to 0%. If it was not deliberate and no steps were taken to hide it, then either the penalty will be low or even suspended, which is likely to happen if it is only a few small errors, as you suggest. There is no real threat of 'legal action'. Once their enquiry is over they will make an assessment of additional tax due, interest and penalties. Any part if that assessment can be appealed to tribunal and/or you can request an internal review if the decision is unfair. So, none if that I would really describe as HMRC taking legal action, although some if their requests count as formal legal notices. If they are being as heavy handed as you suggest then it sounds like these errors are more substantial than your family member is making out. An enquiry in to family members is sometimes appropriate where they also work for the business or directly receive funds from it, but if this was not the case and it was more of a 'pay up now or else I'll make your family's life hell' kinda thing then that would certainly be grounds for complaint/review/appeal and probably disciplinary action against thay inspector.

Again - an attempt to claim that there's nothing wrong with Islam itself, that problems like Islamism are due to a misrepresentation and misunderstanding of the religion.

But I think there *are* problems with Islam.  There *are* problems when people try to follow the words of Islamic texts.  Good grief.  Practically every surah in the Quran fantasizes about unbelievers being tortured in hell-fire.  I know we'd all like to pretend that Islam is an inherently peaceful doctrine, but it's not.

So what can be done?  I don't want to convert, deport or kill anyone.  But I think that Islam does need to foster a spirit of self-criticism.

Before whining starts about the wisdom of spending money on space research/exploration while there are other issues facing India:

1) [ISRO's(Indian Space Research Organization) budget is only **0.34** per cent of Central Government expenditure currently and 0.08 per cent of the GDP(~USD 800 Million).](http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/winning-is-a-matter-of-belief-isro-chief/article3875930.ece) Compare that to billions spent on ""Fix Poverty"" programs such as Employment Guarantee Programs([NREGA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi_National_Rural_Employment_Guarantee_Act), USD 7.24+ Billion spent each year) and Subsidized/Free Food Program([FSB,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Food_Security_Bill,_2013)USD 20+ Billion to be spent each year) etc.

2) [And Mars Orbiter Mission/Mangalyaan would cost USD ~**74** Million only.](http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/isro-plans-to-push-more-satellites-this-year/article4469711.ece)

3) ISRO is actually funding itself thanks to annual revenue from foreign satellite launches and sale of satellite data/imagery(that is useful for things like Google Maps for example) through its Antrix Subsidiary. Last time I checked it was **INR 9 BILLION**. [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antrix_Corporation).

4) Data generated by ISRO and related organizations is helping the poorest of poor in India:

&gt;Voluminous data from the Indian remote sensing satellites has benefited millions of farmers and fishermen in achieving higher productivity and making optimal utilisation of resources, a senior space scientist said Saturday.

&gt;""Studies by the premier economic research institute NCAER have shown that remote sensing data has accrued multiple benefits to farmers across the country **with seven percent increase in productivity and helping the farm sector to contribute about Rs.50,000 crore to the national gross domestic product (GDP) over the years**,"" Indian Society of Remote Sensing president V.K. Dadhwal told reporters here.

&gt;Similarly, **application of remote sensing data by the fishing community contributed about Rs.24,000 crore to the GDP and saved fuel consumption by 30 percent** with timely advisories on weather, sea conditions and identification of potential fishing zones for maximizing the catch.  [source](http://zeenews.india.com/news/science/remote-sensing-data-benefits-indian-farmers-fishermen_835856.html)

5) And it is saving lot of lives:

&gt;India was hit hard by Cyclone Phailin, with 12 million people impacted, including millions evacuated from the Odisha coast to safety earlier this week. This was the strongest storm to hit the state in 14 years, and it devastated homes and villages in both Orissa and Andhra Pradesh states, with flooding that has closed roads and left some 100,000 people stranded.[..]

&gt;**The country's satellite imagery satellites are being credited with saving lives thanks to better forecasting, and the ability to share intensity with citizens and policymakers to urge evacuation.** [..]

&gt;There are 11 Indian remote sensing satellites in service, allowing the National Remote Sensing Centre in Hyderabad to help agencies **forecast cyclones more than 72 hours in advance.** [..]

&gt;The **synthetic aperture radar satellites, Risat-1 launched in April last year and Risat-2 which has been in orbit since April 2009 have the ability to look for impending cyclones even at night and through clouds**. The synthetic aperture radar in the satellites enables applications in agriculture too, especially for paddy monitoring during kharif season. Saral, an Indio-French satellite launched on February 25, 2013, can study ocean circulation and sea surface elevation.

&gt;**""Those who criticise the expenditure on space science don't realise its contribution to not just saving lives but alleviating poverty,""** says Bhargava, who founded the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad. ""You can argue that the space department gets higher allocation, but it is well justified. After all, Indian space scientist makes satellites and rockets at a fraction of the cost of similar US projects."" [source1](http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-10-13/india/42992231_1_satellites-cyclones-isro) [source2](http://www.asmmag.com/2012-12-30-14-40-18/feature/5908-india-credits-satellite-sentinels-for-saving-lives.html)

TL;DR: Investment in Science and Technology == Good.

I suspect a combination of anti-western sentiment along with your basic, run-of-the-mill impoverishment.

1. The major changes after WW1 and WW2 are such distant history to the majority of people that it is hard to imagine a life without the NHS. While there may be a few on the extreme right who'd like to abolish health care which is free at the point of use we're a long way off this happening if it does at all. Tinkering with how services are delivered is not and should not be such an issue. Many scandanavian countries have mixed public/private provision of health care. Also Singapore is a good case study for private provision and public payment. So to so extent the right has accepted the changes the left has introduced.

2. Secondly, people still identify upwards and until this changes (which may be sooner than we realise) people will focus more on the aspirational elements of policy and punishing those who are seen to be free-riding.  This is closely linked to the 3rd issue.

3. For quite some time now we seem to have hit a poltiical consensus. There is very little left that is ideologically driven as things were in the post war periods.  There are very few new, radical ideas that people want to subscribe to, or has not captured the public imagination. 

Nationalisation was ot a good thing for the UK relative to the success of privatisation (not everything was a success but many things were). IF the left wishes to succeed it needs new ideas that inspire, not tinkering at the edges of capitalism.

No, but a lot of the money supposedly going to aid the poor is probably being spent on stupid shit by those corrupt officials. 

&gt;All that goes to fund more projects that help the people of India. Moreover it provides opportunities for the educated people to stay back instead of going to other countries and prevents 'brain drain' which is one of the biggest problems.

They were able to do this not because they were good at their jobs but because they were unaccountable and impervious to actual responsibility.

They had a meeting in the lead up to the 2010 election to discuss their tuition fees situation and realised they were not going to be able to deliver it in a coalition, but continued saying they would while running campaign ads like this: http://youtu.be/jTLR8R9JXz4

While individual party members have stood against individual policies the hierarchy have been more concerned about power.

Plus even at their height they weren't going to be elected to even a minority government. Which means that a vote for them will not affect who the dominant party is and may actively hurt your interests. Vote Lib Dem and get Tory is not a very appealing strategy. This time round it could even be Vote Lib Dem get UKIP which would be (for the average LD supporter) a nightmare. Hence tactical voting. If you are in a UKIP/Tory area this election, you might well vote Tory to avoid UKIP getting a seat (this is a problem for UKIP but they can do little about it and it's why they almost certainly won't get a seat).

The once chance they had was AV and it failed. Without AV the spread of their voting base means that even when they poll reasonably this doesn't transfer into an equivalent number of seats. By contrast Labour and Tory have many 'safe seats' and 'political heartland' (big cities/the north and countryside/south respectively) and do fairly badly outside those areas. So despite only getting 40% or so of the vote they get a majority government.

In the US this is even more marked, the country is roughly divided into three groups: Red states (Republican), Blue states (Democrat) and Battleground (either). Any third party has almost zero chance to break this stranglehold. During an election there are states that aren't even worth the other party campaigning in - why waste time in a state which has voted in a 90-10 split every election for the last 50 years - even if, by some miracle, it goes 60-40 you'll still see no return on that (financial and time) invested and you risk losing other states which could be genuinely likely to vote for you.

You've picked comments by trolls or morons trying to get a reaction. I wouldn't put much thought on idiots like that as the internet is filled with them.

&gt;Do you think only poor should live in India? 

I'm well aware that poverty is a problem world wide, that governments all over the world are letting their own people down. But that wasn't your question, you were talking about India. Plus you seem to be twisting what I'm saying.

&gt;Why don't you want jobs for educated people trained in fields related to space research? 

I have no problem with space research, but as somebody on here said, the Mars mission smacks of vanity.

&gt;Oh you want them to migrate so India doesn't develop?

Again, you're putting words in my mouth that I didn't say. OK, I'll ask you a question. Do you think that you would have a more developed nation if you have an education system that helped raise more out of poverty?

false,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;400,000 voters seems like a lot, but in the grand scheme of 4.3 million registered voters it isn't quite such a strong lead.

So...you're using the number of people that didn't vote to belittle the result. Which, of course, it doesn't. A majority of 400,000 doesn't 'seem' like a lot, *it is*.

&gt;If voting was compulsory, an extra 900,000 people could have influenced the vote and made or broken either campaign.

'If' is a big word. 'If' *Scottish People* who now lived in England or abroad were allowed to participate, rather than restricting it only to people that live in Scotland, I suspect it would have gone much more towards the 'No' - so ultimately, together with the youngsters, the referendum was already unfairly biased towards the 'Yes' crowd, and they *still* lost.

&gt;The younger voters turned out more than anybody and I don't believe they're likely to grow into their no-voting forebears

Haven't seen any evidence that this will happen. It's not exactly a new pattern, so you'd have to demonstrate why this will be so as opposed to the norm.

&gt;I was referring to the way you format your posts and the word salad I had to rummage through to find an actual reply.

Two short sentences is a word salad? Righto.

&gt;On top of this you seem to take issue with my assertion that the two largest political parties are backtracking on their promises of devolution, which they are.

Which is a take on things that says more about how you'd prefer them to be as opposed to how they actually are. Do you really, seriously think that *all three* of the main parties are going to pretend they *won't* be hoisted by their own petards, for making pledges etc. that they then ignore? Are they really going to deliver for Scotland and the other territories that are affected will just have to be sorted out later? Would you have berated Salmond for not putting a currency solution in place within eight (now nine) days?

&gt;Stating facts does not deserve any such reply.

In your opinion. When you're using such 'facts' in such a short term after the vote...well, that says more about you than the issue.

&gt;Scotland and Quebec are directly comparable and I don't see why you can't understand that. 

Illustrate how they have a similar social, geographical or economic history - otherwise you're asserting that wanting independence is all that's needed to draw a parallel, which is silly.

&gt;Both have had repetitive referendums come out of nowhere

Scotland's didn't come out of nowhere. Last week *or* in 1979.

&gt;and both have been torn down the middle by nationalists and loyalists.

Quebec's last referendum was much closer that Scotland's - 'torn down the middle' is therefore another expression that doesn't do much other than demonstrate how you personally *need* to see this issue as opposed to being an accurate summary. Or to put it another way, if the vote had been 55% *in favour of independence*, would you now be complaining about Salmond not holding another referendum to address the issue within eight days?

&gt;And Scotland's referendum was too close for anyone to call. 

Odd how so many (on both sides) are acknowledging it as 'decisive'. It's almost as if you're expected to abide by the rules of democracy *regardless of whether it goes in your favour*.

&gt;If you predicted the exact result beforehand then you should probably go buy a lottery ticket because you have some fucking gift.

He also gets about the pitch a lot. While he is a classic RW, using his pace to take the ball to the byline for a cross, he often wanders inside and sometimes to the left as well, making him much harder to track.
Last night, after scoring his goal, I think Kirkland was worried about getting hit at his front post again, so rushed out to block Navas, who simply then slid the ball across the box for Pozo to score instead.

I was refused by a black cab driver on my last trip into Heathrow because the destination was too close, until I explained that it was just the first of 4 places I needed to go to and I wanted to be able to leave my paperwork laptop etc in the back of his cab at each one and have him wait for me. Then all of a sudden he loved me and couldn't have been more helpful.

There is a huge amount contempt and outright disgust and you see it every time there is a discussion about obesity. If you are fat it's your own fault and you are just a lazy over eating cunt and you don't deserve anything less but harsh criticism. As if being obese is a lifestyle choice and these people really want to be fat.

I have some experience with this as I spent many years with an undiagnosed medical condition. Despite working out and being a very keen cyclist I could never get the weight to drop off. Even after being diagnosed the doctors really had no clue as to what I should do about it, it was only after doing the research myself and speaking with a doctor in the U.S that I got some actual direction. I changed my diet and the weight just fell off.

You also have to consider education. Not everyone is taught healthy eating habits, the existing current dogma surrounding diets and exercise is a load of bollocks. We've been told for 30 years to eat less fat, we are eating less fat than we ever have done yet we are getting more and more obese. Slowly people are starting to realise that chugging a low fat yoghurt might actually be worse for you if the fat's been replaced by carbs and sugar. People buy low-fat mayonnaise thinking they are making the healthy choice but it's been replaced by sugar and carbs and has twice the glycemic index.

It's a big complex issue and there are a thousand reasons why people are fat. It's not just their own fault for being a lazy. Try and have more compassion and understanding. That doesn't mean we have to go full retard and suppport all that BodyPositive wank that says you can be happy at any weight because clearly being obese is a health issue. 

That being said we need to consider it more as an clinical illness than simply a lifestyle choice.

&gt; You MUST NOT leave a parked vehicle unattended with the engine running or leave a vehicle engine running unnecessarily while that vehicle is stationary on a public road. Generally, if the vehicle is stationary and is likely to remain so for more than a couple of minutes, you should apply the parking brake and switch off the engine to reduce emissions and noise pollution. However it is permissible to leave the engine running if the vehicle is stationary in traffic or for diagnosing faults.

But being treated as any other human being would in the same circumstances is not the same as being ashamed nor is it a form of regression. Having to identify oneself as married only as a colloquial term because law does not recognise your union as marriage may seem perfectly fine for you, but why do we have the distinction?

I don't for a second believe civil unions exist purely because homosexual couples want to keep themselves unique and distinct, rather from traditional (read: bigoted) views from people who feel that heterosexual marriage is threatened by the status being granted to anyone other than themselves. 

Homosexuals are being bashed, certainly less so than in previous years, but to say there are people within society who feel nothing short of disgust that their traditional social norms are being handed out as if they're the rights of all law abiding human beings and not just to those privileged few must be a bitter pill to swallow.

It's not just the broken promises, it's that they completely gave in to the tories when in fact they (the Lib Dems) have all the power. No bill passes without the Lib Dems. None of this needed to have happened. If Clegg had left the Conservatives to do their best (worst?) as a minority government, they would have inevitably crumbled - or at the very least, we wouldn't be where we are now. The Lib Dems saw their chance for power, took it, and then didn't even use it to their full advantage when they had it.

&gt; What are the licensing requirements to drive with Uber in London?
&gt; Uber works with Public Carriage Office (PCO) licensed drivers. At the time of onboarding, you will need to bring with you all up-to-date legally required documents. For yourself this includes:
&gt; 
&gt; a valid driver's license
&gt; driver's license counterpart
&gt; PCO license.
&gt; For your vehicle you will also need to bring:
&gt; 
&gt; a valid MOT
&gt; logbook
&gt; commercial insurance certificate
&gt; PCO license.

As to your security concerns - when you book an Uber, you see a picture of the driver, his car and reg.  To pick you up, he'll have to accept the journey on his phone, which he can only do with his uber issued phone and password, which is required to be in the car, and tracking him, throughout the entire journey.  If you're still concerned, you can even send a link to somebody else so they can track your journey in real time.",0,1411640219,null,0,false,0,cks1q4z,t3_2hdd59,t1_cks1q4z,t1_cks1ocz,null,1426832087,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Bad black cab drivers are massively outnumbered by the number of bad (and unlicenced) minicab drivers.

Taxi fares are regulated and the current fare is displayed on the meter. If it goes higher than you expect, you can request that they stop and let you out early.

&gt; Except for when they don't and are now totally outclassed by modern GPS with live traffic and roadworks updates.

Taxi drivers have a mandatory ""knowledge"" qualification that ensures that they have extensive knowledge of the area. GPS systems are getting better, but are still can't replace local knowledge, and there's no reason why you can't have both.

&gt; There's already perfectly adequate regulation for all cars and actually zero guarantee that the car you are in is compliant.

The MOT doesn't cover nearly as much as the approval process for new Taxi designs. Taxis display a plate like [this one](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/71/PCO-Licence.jpg) that confirms that it is compliant.

&gt; Again, basically no guarantee that this is actually the case.

See the above. The licence plate also confirms this.

Because no one would want to do it, not even you or the other commenter who are proposing it.

We'll still have taxis and buses and trains, they'll just be automated. Private vehicles will stay private vehicles and we will share them as much, if not less than we do now.

Maybe more people will buy into an automated taxi service which is cheaper but the shortcomings of sharing with other people will still be there. While at the same time the cost of owning and operating your own automated vehicle will actually be lower than owning and operating a private vehicle now.

A degree will increase your earning potential, but make sure you take useful modules and marketable skills. Half the point of a degree is to prove you can work to professional standards and to teach you how to handle bureaucracy, but the other is to gain actual applicable skills.

You wanna do Graphic Design? Try take a couple marketing modules as free electives if they're not already in your course, so you can find work in a marketing department as their in-house designer, that kind of thing.

Experience can be important, and if you do a degree, you should definitely try to fit in an internship at some point so long as it doesn't damage your studies - looks great on paper, is a little extra cash if you're lucky, and puts you ahead of competing graduates.

University is also an amazing time of your life. I'm biased but seriously, it's amazing.

Some things to note - party hard, but get your shit together. You might be the best graphic designer at your school, it means nothing at university. You have to study hard as well as play hard. That's why students are always tired - they are either hungover from booze or an all-nighter at the library. I almost messed up my degree, and it was only by putting in the effort in final year that I recovered and got a decent grade.

After university, you will have plenty of marketable skills, especially if you did an internship. You will also have access to graduate entry courses, some of which can be seriously lucrative - big companies want to acquire new, young talent who they can give their own training and guidance to, in order to mould their next generation of managers/experts/techs/department heads.

Does it include only in UK or in connection with the rest of Europe?

In any case, couple of them:

- new opportunities to live and work in Europe without a hassle, nor requirement for first job placement and usually high skill possession. You went for a holiday to Spain, you loved it so much there that even during that stay you started looking for job there. If you found one, or have extra money, you don't even have to come back from that holiday, just stay there, or make actual plans when you get back to UK;

- retire abroad in Europe, again without much hassle. Probably possible with other non-EU countries but I would expect much more hassle and possible limitations;

- expensive studies in UK (after all, you do have to pay them off eventually). Look for a EU country which offers them for free (or real cheap). Often those courses can be found in English and if you are learning other language already, you have a great chance to study in it. At the same time you visit a new country and can explore it;

- better air passenger rights;

There are plenty more, good start up page is: [The EU - what's in it for me](http://www.the-eu-and-me.org.uk/whats-in-it-for-me/travel-working/air-passenger-rights)

With direct, as in UK-only improvements:

- there are plenty of typically EU funded programmes, which help different social groups as well as business. These of course could exist even without the EU but the questions is, would UK make them and if yes, whether in such form?

- plenty of pro-green stuff, which surprisingly UK had to be told about. Like some recent EU's extension of time for the deadline, as UK didn't meet some kind of pollutant level, the same pollutant which is responsible for thousands (?) of dead each year. You could argue that UK could do it on their own, but this clearly shows that UK doesn't. Why? I haven't got a clue....

- easier to trade with whole Europe, so economic reasons as well.

I also don't agree with some things EU does. For example:

- the Brussels to Strasbourg travelling circus;
- things like ""unaccounted expenditure"" for MEPs;
- bit confusing process of making new laws/voting for them etc, which is too often not understood by people and used by anti-EU ones, who claim it's not a democratic process (in my view, it is, just not clearly fully). On the other hand it's hard to make those things easy, simply because of different facts like: countries have different sizes (hence they get more/less MEPs), yet they are one of the members and should be equally counted as well (hence existence of Council of Europe with one head of state from each country).",0,1411640915,null,0,false,0,cks1uih,t3_2hevk0,t1_cks1uih,t1_cks1gkz,null,1426832031,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Met some nice people but got myself a reputation as a bit of a bellend. Messed up some exams in my first semester and got 48% again.

Worked very hard for a year completing the job &amp; assignments &amp; losing weight. Started taking Class A drugs at the weekends which was very very fun (don't do too much!!!).

Finished my placement year &amp; managed to get a first for it! This made my final year a lot easier in terms of pressure to get a 2:1. I worked very hard, joined a Hockey Club (amazing decision, I gained a lot from it &amp; still play to this day). Completed my dissertation in good time using the ethic I gained from my placement year. 
Moved home and got a good job in an energy company where I have been for about 14 months. Recently managed to get onto the Civil Service Fast Stream as an Economist. Going to do that in November.

false,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; the Scottish parliament has income tax varying powers itself to vary the total amount it gets (and this changes in 2016 to even greater powers which requires the Scottish parliament to actively choose a tax rate rather than just following the rest of the UK 'by default').

Which sounds good in theory, but in practice these tax varying powers are something of a poisoned chalice (deliberately so, IMO).

The current powers (Scotland Act 1998) only allow the basic rate of income tax to be varied, it must stay within 3% of the UK rate, and Scotland would have had to pay HMRC an extra surcharge to administer the service.

The new powers (Scotland Act 2012, applying from 2016) does allow all three rates to be varied, however they can't be varied independently and they must stay within 10% of the UK rate.

So the current system is that Scotland can't raise the higher rate of income tax, and if it raises (or drops) the basic rate then it has to pay a fee for the privilege of doing so. The new system is that Scotland can raise the higher rate of income tax, but if it does so it also has to raise the basic rate.

IMO this is one of the problems with the current proposals for enhanced devolution.

Firstly the chain pub. This is a [wetherspoons](http://lateralproperty.co.uk/content/uploads/2013/01/wetherspoons.jpg) for example and it's pretty 'Mickey Mouse standard' as pubs go. Everywhere you go the wetherspoon's will probably give you the exact same experience. On the plus side it's often the cheapest pint and dependable when you have an hour to kill for a train or something.  
Secondly is the [local pub which is slowly transitioned into a gastropub](http://www.orbissouthmelbourne.com/images/orbis-south-melbourne-apartments-lifestyle-local-pub.jpg). Often found in the middle of large cities there's a large focus on food. It's generally very clean and modern, slightly more expensive than the chain. I might add, this style has come under a lot of flak from people who see this as 'going against everything a pub is about' which is largely bollocks, I'd rather see a pub adapt and stay afloat than see it close.  
Lastly is the [local at the end of the road or the town/village pub/club. [examples](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-PAqNbeTmUJc/UgHR8bQYSqI/AAAAAAAADYM/lntssXgZUII/s2048/Photo%252520Aug%2525206%25252C%2525202013%25252C%2525204%25253A27%252520PM.jpg) [2](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4QovkK6d_DU/T187qqTQLpI/AAAAAAAAAfU/JkD1YPXrESg/s1600/Miner%27s+Arms,+Milton+2011.JPG) [3](http://www.ecocampuk.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/05-The_Green_Man_Pub_Horsted_Keynes_Fireplace.jpg) .  
These come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, the pictures provided are pretty lacklustre as the differ so wildly. They can be rough as hell or (usually) warm and friendly. Found on council estates, street corners, standalone or built into a main/market street of the town. They often have quiz nights and the like. Serve the most varying booze and fluxuating prices. Food is less of a focus and crisps, pork scratching and nuts are usually all you'll get.  

All three of these pubs may also have a jukebox, [bandit/fruit machine](http://www.fruitmachinesinfo.co.uk/images/fruit-machines/bellfruitgames/deal-or-no-deal.jpg) or stage for live bands all for entertainment.

false,ninereeds314,null,null,"Bullying can cause obesity, basically because a long-term sustained stress response can cause obesity. It may sound counter-intuitive - stress burns more energy, and a lot of those fat-burners trigger the autonomic stress response to do it - stress in this context is a physiological thing, as much linked to excitement as about fear or anger. The trouble is once the immediately available blood sugar is depleted, when the stress response is active, the body tends to burn *muscle* for energy, not fat.

The short term reason is because releasing energy from fat takes time, whereas muscle is right there where it's needed. In a short term emergency, losing a tiny amount of muscle isn't a problem - you just replace it next time you eat some protein.

In the long term, if the stress is sustained too much, it means you lose muscle and get hungry (because you need the protein to replace the lost muscle). If you don't get a high enough proportion of protein (perhaps because you can only afford cheap shitty fat-and-carbohydrate food) you accumulate fat without fully replacing the muscle. Less muscle means a lower resting metabolic rate, so you burn less energy when you *are* burning bodyfat.

The you get the eat-fresh-fruit-and-veg doctrine. But that contains virtually no protein - even the small amount of carbohydrate it provides is still too much carbohydrate when you mainly need protein.

Why could this actually make sense for our ancestors even for long term stress? Well, the obvious long-term stress for our ancestors was famine. If there's no food available for long periods, preserving as much fat as possible, losing the energy-expensive muscle, and getting the metabolic rate as low as possible to hopefully outlast the famine was a good survival strategy.

Of course it also doesn't help if the only safe place away from the constant bullying is indoors, so you can't get any exercise. After all, it's not just burning energy in a more balanced way, and it's not just encouraging your body to build muscle and increase your metabolic rate, it also releases endorphins which can suppress the stress response.

Incidentally, this burn-muscle-for-energy stress response thing is also part of why you should warm up before exercise, and why using fat-burners (or just drinking caffeine all day every day) can be counter-productive.

I picked my course based on what interested me. I then looked for a list of unis that provided sources in that topic, went to a few open days, and decided on Leicester because they (a) have a good reputation for Ancient History and Archaeology and (b) had a well planned, informative open day hosted by friendly, accessible lecturers.

&gt; What was the process like applying to a university?

Can't remember, it was like 2005/6.

&gt; What exactly do you do at university?

Lectures, seminars, essays, studying in the library, attending club activities, riding the Pater Noster in the Attenborough Tower (this last one is Leicester-specific).

* Lectures: Arrive at the posted location 2 minutes before the posted time, chat with other students for a bit, go in, sit down, listen and make notes. Doodle in margins of notes. Occasionally nod off if lecturer has a monotonous delivery. Once back home/ on a library PC, I'd download the lecture slides too.

* Seminars: read the assigned reading, make notes, attend seminar and discuss assigned reading with others at seminar.

* Essays/studying in the library: Each module has a series of assignments to complete, including a final exam, just like at A-levels. But at uni, essays are not like A-level essays. In A-levels, for humanities subject essays, we'd have to read a source and discuss that source and what it says, occasionally in comparison to another source. Like comparing a newspaper report from 1944 to a soldier's war diary describing the same event. At uni, it's totally different. You start with a topic and you've got to go looking for sources. And you need to use as many as you can. In the first year, you'll probably be supplied with a suggested reading list of three or four books or journal articles. This is your starting point. Make notes from those sources, and make a note of which sources they cite too - and then go to those cited sources and see what else you can find out. Then look for anything with certain key words in the title of the book or journal article, searching the library catalogue. By the time I was in third year, my process when starting on an essay was to get a whole stack of books, everything that might have something relevant to say, and quickly scan the appropriate chapters, search the index, etc. I'd sort them into piles: useful or not useful. The not useful pile would go back on the shelf, and then I'd start in earnest with the others.

* Club activities: joining student societies is a great way to make new friends and structure your social life. It's boring staying in every night, and most societies had a weekly event that broke up the week nicely, not to mention monthly or term social events.

&gt; What is after university - can you look for work placement in your 2nd year?

Yes, look for opportunities to get work placements in the summers between years, or to assist a professor on a research project. It's worth the experience and it looks good on your CV. Plus the networking is useful too.

&gt; Anything you wish you knew before hand?

How to take notes effectively, both in lectures and when studying for essays and exams. I eventually developed a good system, but at first I was terrible. In lectures, it's best to try and listen carefully and only take occasional notes - the slide show will be downloadable, and key info will be available in that. Only note down questions you want to follow up afterward (either at the end of the lecture or privately when reading) and key ideas that spark something or would be useful for the assignment you are going to write.

For studying, I developed a process for note taking that made it very easy to go back and find where I'd been reading when I made the note, and made my notes nice and organised. First of all, colour coding: red for the bibliographic entry (the full name of all authors, full title of the book or journal article, publisher, etc). Blue for general notes about what I'd reading. Green for personal musings leading on from those notes including questions I wanted to follow up on. Black for direct quotes from the text I was making notes from. If you're going to be making notes on a laptop, though, you can use the Styles in Word to do that too, changing fonts and adding bold or italics, etc. I did mine handwritten.

I made a note of the page number for every single individual note I made, in the margin. For larger assignments, I also ""tagged"" each note according to what part of the topic it covered, under the page number. Including the page number makes it easy to go back to the source and find what was written, to then compare with other sources. You'll also need to mention page numbers when citing this in the essay, eg:

&gt; It is unclear how literate the population of Athens was in the classical period, but estimates have ranged from 10% to 50% having sufficient understanding to read and write a complete sentence, with up to 90% of people understanding common words and numerals like those used on market produce (Thomas, 1999, p 72-74).

Everything has to be cited. Always cite sources. And to enable that efficiently, make notes that allow you to put down the right location without needing to look in the book again.",0,1411643060,null,0,false,0,cks284v,t3_2hf0d7,t1_cks284v,t3_2hf0d7,null,1426831853,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Eventually, as in most commerce, this expanded into providing other forms of support to those local leaders favorable to British interests and not to those that didn't. This ultimately turned into the East India Company army and, after the mutiny, the British Indian Army. 

When the British went to India it was a place, not a country. Some of the nation states that existed IN India were loosely arranged into a form of empire themselves, others were not. They were also in virtually perpetual war with each other. 

The British Raj wasn't ""built"" on anything. The British Raj is the term used to describe the final 100 years of British involvement in India following the mutiny, when control shifted from company hands to direct state control. It was also the point when the British started to heavily invest in domestic infrastructure - yes, like universities - under the belief it would help the Indians form their own structured civil service, so they wouldn't need to be governed by Europeans, which had been a contributory factor to the mutiny. Ultimately that is exactly what it did - and by the end of WW2 British and Indian interests had diverged, and India's domestic capability increased to such an extent that they separated fairly peacefully considering. 

The basis for your argument is that left to their own devices, the industrial revolution would have reached places like India by some other more preferable method.

No, but it's a good start. Compared to other countries worldwide, we're doing a very good job of it.

Charity is a top-up from this point. So that £20k there, how much did the UK government give in aid? The £20k a on top of what our taxes are already doing.

But Clegg looks to be going to push out, so there is new opportunity for the party after the next election to re-build. This is a great opportunity to win back support for the Young voters, the Lib Dems have always been about young voters and as a they go back to roots after what will look like a tough election. 

The other many factor is there pro-EU stance. The Lib dems seem like the only party who want to work with the EU to make it more federal giving people a greater say in Intra-European politics. 

The Lib Dems stand for the middle, they stand for looking at problems then coming up with solutions for these problems, they try and balance it between the individual and whats best for the state. They accept they criticism for there problems and rather then deflect.

I think this is a poor idea, really. 

Chancellors aren't expected to be some kind of economic genius sitting atop the country's finances- they're the products of an extensive policy process, and work within structures designed around the assumption of certain levels of expertise. 

Having, say, done a single year of Economics at the start of your undergrad twenty years ago doesn't really qualify somebody for the post any more than, say, a History degree would, if they've been involved in the party policy sphere for that period. They'll already posess a sound grasp of the topic by dint of the path that put them into the job in the first place. The endless parades of advisors around them *are* professionals in the field- they're not going to make decisions without consulting with them beforehand.

* Firstly I suspect those numbers are cooked. Ultimately we're talking about GDP figures from a PLACE, rather than a nation, at a time when records for the vast majority of trade didn't take place. I really doubt they are accurate for either India or Britain.

* Secondly, I would also point out that when India left the UK in 1947 there had been a [fairly major world event](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II) several years earlier, that had a tremendous effect on the economy of many nations. Not least India which had also simultaneously had a famine. It also saw the rise of three monolithic nations - Russia, the United States and the Empire of Japan. i.e. looking at Indian GDP estimates from 1947 probably isn't judging India by its best performance. It also neglects a bigger picture which is the industrialization of the modern powerhouses like the USA. 

* On the Meiji Restoration in Japan, that really is a very interesting topic. The reason being that Japan is the exception rather than the rule. They industrialized very late (in the 1870s!) and had been protected from the rest of the world by their geographical position and their strict isolationist policies. For example I believe foreigners were not even allowed to make landfall at most ports in Japan until after the restoration. However, I wouldn't necessarily paint it as a golden example of industrialization. It meant the Japanese underwent one of the most rapid and aggressive transformations from a pre-industrial almost feudal state to a westernized trade empire in less than 30 years. To say that was painless is simply wrong, and as with industrialization in India and the UK it created winners and loosers.

&gt; The fact is that today, even with the Empire, India is not an industrialized nation

The fact is that overeating is the main cause of obesity.

For the average person the fat/muscle argument is not particularly relevant. As long as they maintain *some* form of exercise (like standing and walking every day), they're not going to be losing muscle mass at a huge rate.

The average person simply needs to eat less, and make better choices about WHAT they eat. Food is surprisingly calorie dense.

Pick the course by thinking about what job you want and checking (as in actually have a list of graduate programmes or vacancies) for the career you want that require the degree you are studying for. Don't go assuming you will 'figure it out'.

At university you should work hard - even the first year grades count - not on your transcript, but for getting internships which is vital for getting a job.

Yes you should look for paid internships during the summer - in the first year it's pretty much impossible, but I got paid by the German government to work in research labs there for two summers which was fun (und heute ich kann ein bisschen Deutsch sprechen :D)

Try and make sure you know what you want to do and have at least a somewhat reasonable and realistic plan.

Yes it is worth it, for any professional career you need a degree these days pretty much - my dad became a successful programmer without one but times have changed.

I don't know about design stuff - just be sure that there are sufficient vacancies in the field - if only 5% of the people actually end up working in design then it's a poor bet.

Ultimately you should enjoy yourself and learn cool stuff and meet awesome people - this doesn't have to involve drinking shittons and acting like a tosser, there are plenty of decent societies and some professional societies will help you land a job.

Both polls are ""correct"" in as much as they tell you what their respondents said, but I'd be very wary of extrapolating from either and saying that it's a **fact** that X% of Y age range voted Yes or No.

I don't mind immigration, I don't mind multiple cultures, I don't mind other nationalities, i genuinely think that all people are born equal and I'd love it if we all treated each other as such. 

I still think that religion is a dangerous and ignorant mind set to have, it segregates, it can lead people to actually kill those who don't believe the same bullshit. It's not just Islam, look at the zionists. You can find videos online where they are just as fucking vial as the Islamists.

It's a dangerous mentality and I think that criticising it publicly should be not automatically be equated to ""racism"". I don't give a shit about their race, I care about the fact that they think I and anyone else who is not a muslim should be dead or be converted. I dislike it because they can justify the murder of thousands to them selves and others by quoting an old book.

If I was to say I was a nazi, I wanted to see a rebirth of German nationalism and german influence and control over Europe with the removal of all mentally ill people, all blacks, all gays and all jews. I'd be called a racist, if I was in Germany i'd be locked up. If I was in the UK i'd be ridiculed by everyone especially the left wing press and banned from certain types of jobs.

Yet the believers in Islam, who share some similar views in relation to gays, jews and their own dominance over the world are free to say and do as they please because for some reason if your racist, sexist, appalling ideology is a few hundred years old it's racist to criticise.

&gt;You are comparing a man stealing because he's poor or got some kind of addiction, or assault or even a murder with someone who wants to blow up a bus full of innocents or a tube full of commuters?

Nobody did that. The comparison was that of *convicted* criminals and *suspected* terrorists. Your comment assumes everyone accused of terrorism is guilty, which is demonstrably false.

How can terrorists be easily identified? Are you one of those people that think racial profiling is a necessary evil?

Its possible Smalling may recover in time for the game, but he only just came back after a month away due a groin problem. 

Just thought this was interesting news given we have to play them at Old Trafford come Saturday, and whilst it sucks for anyone to get injured...

LVG will most likely have to play more inexperienced CBs or two who haven't played together - given how their defense was against Leicester and how we tore apart a similarly disorganised Liverpool back line last weekend, I can't help but feel the stars are aligning for BFS to give LVG the 'outtacticed' treatment.

99.9% was hyperbole I admit and it is very hard to find statistics to back up either argument. However if you look at

Lists two medical reasons for obesity, one that affects every 1 in 1000 men and the other there are only about 60 known cases of per year!

So whilst my 99.9% may have been a bit over the top - you can probably round it down to 99.8%

&gt;People are just ""lazy"" right? Same way depressed people need to pull their socks up and stop feeling so sorry for themselves? And people who commit suicide are just weak individuals who really deserve to die because well, it's their own fault for being so weak minded?

..What? Perhaps you should look up a straw man argument and stop making such ridiculous comparisons.


&gt;Do me a favour and stop talking shit, you are just like the vast majority of people who have zero understanding of the matter yet will spout the exact same bollocks. It's like a stuck record ""eat less food and you will lose weight"" 

There really isn't that much to understand. Bodies run on energy, we use food as energy, if we eat too much food we store the excess as fat.

Unless you think some people have found away to create energy from nothing, yes eating less will cause people to lose weight.

&gt;wow, why is society getting fatter if all we have do to is tell them to stop eating less?

People need to make better food choices, eat less and move more. If people don't care about being fat, why would they eat less?

There are many reasons for societies increase level of obesity. Curing obesity isn't done with a pill or an injection, it takes will power and effort.

That never made much sense to me. Why should eating un-needed food be any kind of comfort unless the body needs some kind of food? Have you ever noticed that over-eating tends to be unpleasant? If you don't believe me, ask the people who do it deliberately, such as body-builders.

&gt; you can not get fat unless you consume too many calories

Commonly claimed, obviously true but simplistic.

What I described *is* someone eating ""too many"" calories. That doesn't change the fact that either sufficient protein is needed to replace the muscle lost, or else that's a choice between will-power avoidance of food despite hunger (itself a stress response trigger) or eating more.

Of course it's perfectly fair to say that - often, probably always - choosing to eat the wrong things is as much or more the problem than the stress.

&gt; As long as they maintain some form of exercise (like standing and walking every day), they're not going to be losing muscle mass at a huge rate.

First off, that's a good reason not to drive people back indoors, isn't it? Walking from one room to another isn't enough.

But it doesn't need to be a huge rate. When people first become obese, it tends to build up slowly. The big binges come after dieting. Not so surprising considering the hormones given off by fat cells when they're depleted.

The body has its appetite regulation systems as part of homeostasis, but the body is complex.

&gt; make better choices about WHAT they eat. Food is surprisingly calorie dense.

That's both true and misleading. The reason is, again, homeostasis. Unless you really binge, eating a bit too much just means it's longer until you get hungry again or you'll eat a bit less next time. More exercise = more hunger to balance the energy used etc.

That's true for most of us the vast majority of the time, but it's simply not the whole story.

Of course eating the wrong things is a huge part of the problem, but you know what... the standard diet advice tends to be to emphasize that people don't need that much protein. After all, protein tends to come from animal products that are often also high in fat.

The one thing you say I really disagree with is ""since appetites adjust quickly"". People don't like to accept that appetite regulation exists, and does a remarkable job of keeping most peoples weights roughly constant, but it does. Even obese people have remarkably constant body weights most of the time, unless there's some deliberate over-riding of the appetite going on. Binges tend to happen *because* the person has been trying to diet.

OTOH, the foods in the modern diet most definitely aren't the ones that were available to our ancestors - and the tendency to eat cake when one needs a boiled egg is IMO most definitely part of the problem. Sure that extra piece of cake may provide 500kcal, but that's carbohydrate and fat (and the worst forms of both) with no protein.

Even so, bullying won't replace education, especially when the current education tends to be in denial of certain issues.

For example, the few diets that have been proven to work in the long term are basically Atkins and low-GI. Both focus on eliminating carbohydrate (in the case of low-GI, primarily the simple and processed carbohydrate). But as a side-effect, both tend to increase the portion of protein in the diet. The best scientific studies of Atkins in particular (that I knew of some years back) really pointed the finger at the protein, finding that irrespective of Atkins, people in a controlled study who ate a higher proportion of protein tended to eat less calories overall and slowly lose weight.

Oddly enough, this was described as ""suppressing the appetite"" as if protein was some kind of scary mind-altering drug, whereas logically it seems more likely that it was simply providing the particular nutrient that was needed. And then there was the emphasis on body-builders and the damage they do to there bodies, even though no-one in this case was force-feeding themselves nutrients they didn't need - quite the opposite.

I may be making it sound like there's an evil conspiracy against protein. I really just blame that low-level prejudice saying that it must be the fat persons own fault, so anything that sounds like it might be ""an excuse"" must be refuted. After all, even without specific obesity prejudice being pervasive, there's always the fundamental attribution error.

However, you're right that people should be mindful of how they get those calories and that simply thinking that you can chow down on as much ""low fat"" food as you like is dangerous when it comes to managing your weight. Obviously there are people like yourself who have rarer medical conditions which mean you should avoid certain types of food too.

There's also the issue with a lot of food that it doesn't leave you feeling full. Eat a chocolate bar and you'll probably feel hungry in an hour or less, whereas if you'd eaten something that will take time to process (e.g. porridge) you probably wouldn't.

However, fat people are fat because they take in too many calories and don't use them over the long term. The reason that society is getting fatter is because packing calories into your mouth isn't difficult and requires almost zero thought.

Partially true. After all, how many Brits live in Spain as of this moment? Other EU countries can offer things which UK doesn't have, like the Sun ;)

Also, just because the UK is desirable for the moment it isn't automatic that they will always be. How many people possibly migrated from the UK during the recent recession. Maybe because new opportunities for work have arisen for them? This means it's also a kind of a security.

&gt;Also, as someone who has lived in several different countries (including right now I am not in the UK), it isn't that much hassle

But do you mean in Europe or outside of it? Your sentence would imply it's a non-EU country but obviously you had to apply for a working visa. That I assume would have to be based on finding a work offer first. You then have to make sure your visa doesn't expire and I'd assume you have paid for it. Also, I's presume visas have tier system, meaning it's rather impossible to migrate to USA for work if you are not highly skilled etc.

&gt; I would say that they aren't exclusive to the EU and it would be possible to form trade agreements etc outside of the EU.

Would, could, should.... In theory it's even possible to sell and guy stuff from North Korea. The market has its own rights though and based on the recent Scottish referendum, businesses do NOT like uncertainty. Hell, just looking at recent Tesco news, even speculation can lead to a disaster!

&gt;Personally I'm ok with the EU, but I do think the immigration is a bit one-sided. As probably the best country in Europe, the immigration argument certainly impacts us more.

You are somehow correct, especially that UK has English language.... so best known foreign language. On the other hand though, why be against immigrants who add to the economy and integrate? We are humans after all, so what's the big deal if your co-worker is British or Portuguese?

Somehow scraped BBCb in a host of history related ones, and suddenly had to pick from the list of universities I'd applied for without really thinking. It was simplified for me, though, because only about 13 institutions ran my course. Ended up picking UEA on a whim because their study abroad program was the most impressive.

I studied 3 courses a semester in 1st and 2nd year, abroad in the US in 3rd year, then 3 courses and a dissertation in 4th year. All amounted to anywhere between 6 and 3 hours a week in university. 

Look at prospectuses! They should tell you about work placements etc. Don't apply for a course that doesn't mention work/study abroad program's - my university, at least, wasn't lenient about just letting people wander off in 2nd/3rd year. It was all decided well in advance.

I wish I'd taken on a part time job in 2nd year. I also wish I'd taken anyone's advice and not spent my dissertation semester going on holiday/drinking copious amounts of Merlot and watching Blackadder/finishing 7 seasons of Buffy.

I most certainly would beg to differ. Even if they were not exact figures, the exact figures would be close to what I have mentioned.

That ""fairly major world event"" affected India solely because it was a part of the British Empire. India fought as part of the British Empire. If India was not a part of the Empire, there was a high probability that it would not have been dragged into it. The famine that India had in 1943 was an artificial one that was created solely by British policies. It was created because Churchill and the British government decided to divert huge stockpiles  of food from India to already well supplied Britain and other parts of Europe to fuel the European war machine. In fact, Churchill responded to a telegram sent by the government of India about people dying in the famine by asking ""why hasn't Gandhi died yet?""

http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2031992,00.html

Oh, and this was not the only famine the Empire was responsible for in India. [Here's a timeline of famines in India under British rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_major_famines_in_India_during_British_rule)

Like Tharoor said, Britain's industrialization was made on the de-industrialization of India. British policies forced farmers to grow cash crops like cotton, jute, indigo etc instead of food crops that led to famines in many parts of the country. Raw materials would be grown in India and instead of manufacturing the finished goods in India, they would end up being shipped to Britain after being bought from the farmers at dirt cheap prices and the finished goods would be manufactured and sold back in India at exorbitant prices. It was so bad that at one point of time during the 1900's, India became the largest market for British textiles even though all the raw materials would be grown in India. Many other policies like the [Salt Tax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_British_salt_tax_in_India#Effects_of_the_salt_tax), [Indigo revolt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigo_revolt) etc hammered the Indian economy. You should read about the [Swadeshi movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swadeshi_movement) in India. In fact, the aim of the [Dandi March](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_March) was to protest against the salt tax by producing salt without paying the taxes proposed by the British. The fact that Japan did industrialize without colonialism shows that colonialism was not necessary for industrialization. In fact, the British Empire was disastrous to the Indian economy. 

&gt; Ever been to India? It is every bit as industrialized as anywhere in the UK, if not more so.

Except for the major urban areas, it is not industrialized at all. India was never seen as a nation full of poor people where poverty thrived before the British came. But when the British left, there was abject poverty in almost every part of the country. The British policy of divide and rule ([Partition of Bengal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_Bengal_(1905\))) gave rise to religious intolerance of such an extent that it can be seen even today.",0,1411648022,null,0,1411650040,0,cks3d0k,t3_2hb64z,t1_cks3d0k,t1_cks2flj,null,1426831324,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

But there are diminishing returns on good local knowledge with GPS.  All having a local knowledge does to help is allow them to disregard the GPS if they know a shorter route.  You don't need full knowledge of the area to be more efficient than the pure GPS route, just a passing familiarity.  Since Uber drivers are likely to be going down familiar routes day in and day out, they probably could develop enough familiarity to always pick an optimal route.  And it is also worth noting that Uber actually has a refund system whereby if you feel the driver took an inefficient route, then you can contact Uber who will confirm whether the more efficient route was possible and then refund you appropriately.

Very, very rarely go out to parties or stay up late but I don't work as much as I should/could either, I just bugger around on my laptop most days doing not a lot that most people would consider productive. Don't get me wrong, I live and breathe science, it's one of my true loves but I don't want to do it 24/7 so I take time out to write books for my own amusement, write programs for my own amusement and generally do things not related to science, it's a good tonic and I'd recommend it to anyone; Make sure you have a handful of serious interests outside of your degree to give you some down time.

1st year, went OK and passed with a high 2:1 (68%)
2nd year likewise, 69% (there is a joke there somewhere...)
Currently jut started 3rd year and I'm really stoked to write my dissertation. Evaluation of bacterial autolysins, should be fun but I don't intend on dedicating my whole uni life to it.

The one thing I regret so far is second year, I commuted. It meant I spent at least 2 hours a day doing nothing except travelling, which is a waste at uni. Make sure you live close to your institution and don't waste stuff. I've never had a chance or desire to get a part time job or volunteer. The reason being I'm good at money management so I never ""run out"" and I always have things to do so I'm never bored, my CV will suffer though so this year I need to get out and volunteer to bulk it up a little.

Things I've struggled with? People. Because I'm more introverted than a lot of people, inadvertently on other people's part, I've been made to feel bad about it. There is an ethos at uni that you must go out and I really, really don't like it. If you don't like to party/stay out late, you are almost being an inconvenience to other people in your flat (if you live in halls) and that made me feel really bad for the first semester. Some of my flatmates understood but others didn't and he actually made my life awful for a long time (music into the early hours of the morning, bringing people home and making a racket, waking everyone up etc.) He didn't necessarily understand our annoyance until some others and I went to student support because it got so bad. Over Christmas he had a party and trashed the entire flat,  eventually uni kicked him out. This was all whilst smoking weed in the flat and making everyone's life a misery because of it (smell, attitude issues, music, ignorance etc.). Don't be that guy OP.

On a happier note, I'm on an accredited degree which is extremely successful. In correspondence with the people who accredit the course I'm on it's a rare thing that's looked on favourably so job prospects look good. I'm not sure if a first in an accredited degree with a blank CV is better than a 2:1 with a degree littered with menial jobs done for a few months each though. I like to think it shows dedication to my line of work but I'm not sure that will carry.

If I could do it again, sure I would. I'd almost advise against living in halls but I'm a rare breed being thrust into an environment which invites hostile reactions to those who are ""not like everyone else"" so I'm hardly qualified to advise the masses. I'm hoping mine was just a one off bad experience but Uni is a lot like school, just more ""grown up"" in the sense that now you're just ostracised if you don't fit in, rather than being made fun of.

The best advice I can give you is try, but not too hard. If you try too hard you won't enjoy it, for whatever reason you went in the first place, even if it is to study for a good future job. Don't be someone you're not. There are plenty of societies to join if that's your thing, if not you don't have to but bear in mind that people at Uni will be different from you and don't be afraid of that. 

If you're still reading then as far as UCAS goes, pick a uni and subject you like. Don't pick a subject because it's ""easy"" or it ""sounds nice"". It'll just make it harder when you have to invent a reason to an interviewer later. Be honest about it and pick something you enjoy and a place you like. UCAS is a nightmare and you'll think twice about suicide before the end ;). Seriously though, UCAS will test you. It's the first part of uni, so treat it like it. Be serious and do it, don't put it off for later. The sooner you apply, the sooner you'll likely be accepted and get some places down and feel better about life. If you haven't been accepted to any uni by the time things get serious with exams because you left it late then you only have yourself to blame. Be responsible about it, it's your life.

I know I sound like an old grump but I'm only 20, honest! I just prefer to go to uni to actually study rather than have a traditionally ""good time."" Don't get me wrong, I have a blast with the friends I have, it's just we don't have outlandish desires to be accepted and go out everynight on the piss.

false,BrotoriousNIG,null,null,"I got stuck in Milton Keynes for three hours, once.  It was a grim afternoon.  I was on my way back to Manchester, from a two day stay in Watford at my last company's HQ, and the day finished up early so I set off home early.  I had to switch trains at Milton Keynes, and so I went for a cig outside the station but my ticket wouldn't let me OUT of the station.  I collared a guard and he pointed out that my ticket was off-peak and not valid for another three and a half hours.  So he let me out of the station and I had to wait until my ticket was valid before I could catch a train home.

Worst three hours of my life.  Exited the station and there's just fuck all there.  Couldn't even see Milton Keynes.  Got my phone out to check a map and couldn't see where the fuck I could go with my suitcase and bag that wouldn't be an hour's walk there and back.  Ended up having to mosey over to a Borders bookstore in a nearby (15 minute walk) retail park and sit in a Starbucks for three hours.

What made it worse (and this is not Milton Keynes' fault) is that when I got back to the station to catch my train, I couldn't find my ticket.  I had the desk looking for it, a guard, and then I had to phone my boss and find out that we couldn't petty cash another ticket and that if I've lost it I've lost it and have to pay for it myself.  And then, I took out my iPod Classic, and the fucking ticket had stuck itself to the back.

There are some that **HATE** ENIC, there are some who think ENIC have been solid stewards of the club.  But i think there are a fair amount of supporters who look at ENIC, regardless of personal opinion, and see an investment group that has some money but runs us to be a self sustaining club in a league dominated by an Oligarch, Oil Baron and big money investment groups and think maybe an investment group with more money than our current investment group owners could be the best chance for a move further forward.

false,myimportantthoughts,cnty-uk,It's grim up North London,"I liked politics and economics at A-level and thought economics would be a good bet for a career. Realised economics was insanely competitive and maths heavy so I thought Management looked equally good for a career but was basically easier. Did a decent amount of reading about economics, business and entrepreneurship first to know what sort of thing I was getting into.

Looked up and visited various good unis with management / business courses, applied to 5 and got an offer for Management at LSE which if I'm honest was very lucky given A) it is super competitive and B) my offer was ABB which is LOL low for LSE.

Got AAB at A-level and got into LSE for Management, got insanely ill in week 2 and had to switch to their distance learning course which I am on now. I wouldn't recommend it really, you get zero support and it is pretty tough. Course is totally weird, you turn up for 4 exams at the end of the year and that is it, no contact. Crazy cheap though full cost is like £4K for entire degree.

My courses are about 40% reading a subject guide / textbook, 20% writing notes and 40% doing problems ( maths, economics, finance, accounting etc). 

Hope it will be worth it, definitely learning a lot about business and the LSE brand on my CV should impress employers.

Tips:

1) Do some work experiences / internships as early as you can, in as many different areas as you can. Even if it is a week unpaid. I did 3 of these between year 12/13 in a musuem (OK but slow), tiny recruitment business cold calling (horrible) and a big newspaper (awesome, 10/10 even got 2 tiny pieces published in the back page). Seriously, do not graduate with zero clue what to do with your design degree.

2) Also, spend some time on your Personal Statement.

3) Try to get someone who knows and likes you to do your reference. I had an economics teacher as my tutor who taught me for 3 years do it, which helped. I would try to get someone who likes you (or at least doesn't hate you) and knows a bit about design / art stuff.

4) Only do 3-A2 levels, some guy in my year did 4 and got like ABBC when maybe he could have got AAB if he did 3. Stupid mistake to make.

5) Don't apply somewhere without visiting, hard to get a full picture from their website. Certainly do not accept an offer without visiting.

They aren't ridiculous comparisons. In both cases, people with depression/suicide tendencies are generally considered clinically unwell and there isn't as much stigma attached to people with those conditions. (though still more than their should be)

Being overweight in my opinion is almost exactly the same because in the vast majority of cases people do not CHOOSE to be fat. There are a huge combination of factors which can lead to people being fat.

Your utterly simplistic viewpoint that 99.9% of fat people are just lazy is the same argument that depressed people just need to pull their socks up. You are ignoring a million reasons why someone is fat and condensing it down into a simpletons view of, eat less food = lose weight. Well done, we know that.

&gt;Many people just don't care and are happy to be fat.

Most people seem to think that if you eat a piece of fruit or something ""healthful"", then you gain +1 health points (bonus points if you hit your 5 a day!) This is **wrong**. Also, weight loss is 90% diet. It's far easier to not eat 200 calories rather than exhausting yourself on the treadmill for 30 minutes.

Exercise is largely useful for; 

* keeping your metabolism up when on a large calorie deficit (diet)
* preventing surplus calories from adding up when you've reached your goal weight (1k calories/week from gym 2 or 3 times a week) = 4k cal deficit/ month - losing 1lb/month by default. As it's not always possible to stay under calorie goals - i.e: restaurant, night out with a few beers, christmas period etc it evens out and you'll stay the same.

Eating properly is all about working within parameters. You have a certain amount of calories you can eat before gaining weight (usually 1800 for men, 1600 for women). Within the calories, you need a certain amount of protein, carbs and fat which requires choice making to hit those goals.

Eating a McDonald's burger will get you to the calories easily, but you over consume on the fat at the expense of protein as there won't be enough calories left to achieve your protein goal without going over your TDEE. A far better option would be a low calorie density option, such as chicken breast with 50g of couscous.

The issue is that processed foods and fast food is far more convenient (and perhaps cheaper) but has mountains of carbs and fat, are not very filling and are specifically designed to be addictive. It has reached the point where you have to take a very active role to ensure you are receiving adequate nutrition whilst not eating too many calories.

I realise that perfectly. What you don't seem to realise is that committing murder, plotting to commit murder, and belonging to an organisation that aims to commit criminal actions is already crime, and what we do with crime is to investigate it with the police, gather evidence, make arrests if necessary and try the accused in court. That's how it works and **it is a fundamental part of our way of life**. I and many others are not willing to sacrifice it out of fear or hatred.

&gt;You are comparing a man stealing because he's poor or got some kind of addiction, or assault or even a murder with someone who wants to blow up a bus full of innocents or a tube full of commuters?

No, I'm comparing a convicted criminal with a suspected criminal. I'm comparing someone _suspected_ of stealing, assaulting, or murdering with someone _convicted_ of stealing, assaulting, or murdering. 

&gt;Have you forgotten?

Have you forgotten [Harold Shipman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Shipman) was convicted of murdering 15 innocent people and is thought to have killed over 250? That's almost 5 times as many as died in the London bombings.  What did we do? Did we take his British citizenship from him? Did we get MI6 to assasinate him? Did we sacrifice our rights out of fear that it might happen again? No. We convicted him in a court of law and sentenced him to life imprisonment.

&gt;These people are easily identified and can be caught before they do any harm, so why shouldn't we? 

Who the hell says we shouldn't? We can identify and catch them if they have committed a crime, which includes plotting to commit murder or joining an organisation known to commit criminal acts. We should catch them and try them in court and, if found guilty, they should face the appropriate penalty as set out in the law.

&gt;Its not like joining Muslim extremist groups or going to Syria/Iraq to fight for a terrorist organisation is ""Suspect"" they are damn right fucking guilty part of it. 

It's not like holding a knife to an old woman's throat and taking her money is ""Suspect"", it's damn right fucking guilty of assault and mugging. It's not like shooting your wife in the face is ""Suspect"". It's not like joining a gang that specialises in robbing betting shops is ""Suspect"". Hey, no need for a trial to prove that's what happened and the intentions of the criminals! Let's just throw them in a dark room, take their citizenship, or kill them with plausible deniability! Hooray!

Our whole system is based around proving beyond a reasonable doubt that someone comitted a crime. If it's so fucking obvious that they have committed a crime that you and Theresa May can just ""know it"", don't worry: so will the judge and jury.

I'd rather not have a repeat of that either, but then again I'm not a fucking coward willing to do away with the basic principles of my civilisation just to feel a little bit safer.

&gt;now fuck off trying to treat them like normal citizens. They wouldn't do the fucking same to you.

Yes, I know. And do you think the guy that broke into my grandparents house while they were there and forcefully took my granny's handbag from the kitchen table would treat her like a normal citizen? Do you think any violent criminal would treat either of us as respectfully as the police and our courts would? No, because that's the whole fucking point of us having principles. If you give up on your principles when it's hardest to follow them they're not principles anymore: they're hobbies

But back to your first sencence:

Sustained stress is certainly a common causal factor, but not the whole story by a long shot. Sufficient exercise and a *healthy* diet with sufficient protein will *absolutely* prevent that.

A family-sized ready meal from Iceland may well contain *some* protein, but it's artificially high in carbohydrates and fat of course. It's part of the problem, absolutely. For someone not eating that much else, you'll find the actual number of calories provided perfectly reasonable even for one person - but because it doesn't provide the nutrients needed, that's probably not all that person will eat.

Some boiled eggs also aren't rocket science, but strangely enough, you didn't think of that either.

&gt; If someone wants to lose weight, most people can.

Yes, at least in the short term, or otherwise a relatively small amount of weight. Otherwise, due to homeostasis, actually no. Of course once a person becomes obese to a sufficient degree for long enough, that changes the ""set point"" upwards by known mechanisms - fat cells releasing hormones demanding to be replenished is part of homeostasis, and diet and exercise tend to deplete fat cells - not remove them.

&gt; Unless they've got some mental or physical condition preventing them from doing so.

Well, that's exactly what I'm describing, isn't it.

&gt; Unless someone has a mental compulsion to continue eating poorly then thinking ""Oh, I'll not buy these chocolate biscuits, instead I'll get sunflower seeds and some granola bars."" Is not rocket science.

Sunflower seeds and granola bars are certainly better than most cakes and biscuits, but still show that you don't know much about healthy foods. Granola bars are still heavily processed and high in fat and carbohydrate. Protein at a little under 10% is better than nothing, but not necessarily enough.

&gt; You are responsible for your own body, you decide what you eat and drink, you decide whether you want to watch TV or go and walk in the park.

You decide what food education to receive. You decide whether you can get some exercise without being bullied and driven back indoors. Oh no - wait...

The actual process of losing weight is really easy:

you need to read food labels, understand what is in it - nothing is more important than knowing the total amount of calories.

You then need to work out what someone of your height,gender and activity class should be eating (in terms of calories).

Eat that amount and use a pen/note pad to track what you eat through the day...

Stick to this 90% of the time and make a token effort to be more active, and you really should see results - and if not? 90% of the time its due to poor estimation of what you are eating on a daily basis.

Its easy enough in writing, but the amount of mental hurdles involved in getting to this simple realization is astounding. My ego &amp; deep down fat denial was one part. Fat shaming didn't really help, it just forced me to hideaway from the issue at hand.

&gt;__Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy__ (__HCM__) is a primary disease of the [myocardium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardium) (the [muscle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle) of the [heart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart)) in which a portion of the myocardium is [hypertrophied](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricular_hypertrophy) (thickened) without any obvious cause.       It is a leading cause of [sudden cardiac death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_cardiac_death) in young athletes.  The occurrence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a significant cause of sudden unexpected cardiac death in any age group and as a cause of disabling cardiac symptoms. Younger people are likely to have a more severe form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]

false,kevio17,,Alex Mowatt is just a good Tom Cleverley,"Woo! I made this post nine months ago - I've modified and updated a few bits... so much has changed since then.

**A quick history** 

* Formed in 1919 after Leeds City FC were dissolved after making illegal payments to footballers during WWI.
* Most successful period was in the late 60s/early 70s, winning the league twice in that period, runners up 5 times, won the FA Cup, League Cup and should have won what is now the Champions League but lost out due to a dodgy linesman (1975).
* Then-manager and club legend Don Revie changed the Leeds colours from yellow and blue to all-white to emulate Real Madrid (20-odd-times Spanish champions at the time).
* Also won the league the year before it became the Premiership (1991/92), the season after getting promoted.
* More recently, made it to the semi-finals of the Champions League but spent a *lot* of money in the process, had to sell sell sell as a result, got relegated (twice) and went into administration (twice). 
* Started 2007/8 at the bottom of League One (third tier) with -15 points due to aforementioned admin, ended this season and the following losing in the playoffs before winning promotion as runners-up.
* Currently well-established in the Championship (second tier) for the fourth season in a row, under new manager Darko Milanic who won loads of trophies with Maribor of Slovenia a couple of years ago.

**Some bits to get you up to speed**

Current notable players:

* Jason Pearce, captain. Rock hard central defender from NW London who went to my rival secondary (high) school! Passionate guy who has probably been our most consistent defender over the last few years and tough enough to head a brick back at you if you threw one at him. 

* Rodolph Austin, former captain. Tough tackling and strong centre midfielder who can also power forward and set up a few goals. Passing can be either awful or immense depending on his day but is combative and has recently played in a more advanced role where he has shone. Will shoot from like 30 yards out with a shot that will take your head off at least once a game (and probably not score from it). 

* Sam Byram, young English right back who was thrown into the first team a couple of seasons ago. Quiet and gets on with it but one of the most creative players we've had in years and most people will tell you he should be playing on the right wing (I disagree). 

Most remaining players (who weren't brought through the Academy) were brought in over the summer. Some have had a pretty big impact on the first team (Sloth, Doukara, Antenucci) while others are yet to appear for the side.

Recent names you'll probably hear a lot of:

* Alex Mowatt, Chris Dawson, Lewis Cook - three of the club's most recent academy graduates, all in and around the first team at different stages of the past couple of years. Mowatt's a creative central midfielder who was brought in last year and has recently been brought back into the team. Dawson made a couple of appearances toward the end of the second-to-last season, while Cook broke through this summer after winning the European Championship with England's U17s.

* Giuseppe Bellusci - Italian central defender with the odd error in him but his tough playing style alongside Pearce has earned him the fan nickname of 'the Warrior'. Gathering a bit of a 'cult hero' status after [this immense free kick](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2639fk_giuseppe-bellusci-goal-v-bournemouth-lufc_sport) last week, and [playing a huge part in a charging counter attack the other day](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x26czte_mirco-antenucci-goal-v-huddersfield-assist-giuseppe-bellusci-apopey-lufc_sport) which ended in a chip hitting the crossbar and Antenucci scoring from the rebound.

* Adryan - Brazilian 'wonderkid' who has yet to play for the first team but has garnered a *lot* of hype since signing at the end of the summer. Nicknamed 'the Heir to [Zico](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zico)' in his home country.

* Marco Silvestri - Italian (see the theme?) goalkeeper who, [despite a dodgy hairstyle](http://i.imgur.com/CsN9c4V.jpg), has made a name for himself as a top shot stopper in less than 10 games and has become a popular figure with fans.

* Massimo Cellino - Italian club president who bought the side in April and could well be out of here before Christmas down to a few tax-dodging convictions. Depending on who you ask, he is either the club's saviour, or Satan himself. Brought in [15 new signings](http://www.reddit.com/r/LeedsUnited/comments/2f8zzn/someone_should_do_a_transfer_roundup_please/ck6zvcq) over the summer, most from Italy or Italian clubs. Definitely played a part in helping stabilise our finances and is never dull. Known for sacking managers a lot.

There was a section here about notable former players but I've stopped caring, and you know yourself about McCormack.

And finally:

* Historic rivals - the likes of Man United and Chelsea will always be put into this category. Reasons why could go beyond the text limit of this post, but Man United (*never* just 'United') are the big ones, and both have their own Wikipedia articles ([Man Utd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds_United_A.F.C.%E2%80%93Manchester_United_F.C._rivalry), [Chelsea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.%E2%80%93Leeds_United_A.F.C._rivalry)). [This is up there with the highlights of our recent history, we were in League One at the time (and won btw)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owpnrxCXZJ4), and we also [beat Chelsea 1-0 in a match that lasted 45 minutes last season.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20690782). 

* Geographic rivals - most of these have developed over the last 10 years or so in our period outside the top flight, but recently, matches v Huddersfield, Middlesborough and (not-so-geographically) Millwall have taken on a larger significance (to the away fans at least). The Millwall one probably stems from a) two very, very passionate sets of fans and b) Millwall beating us in the League One playoffs a few years ago.

* Leeds salute - fist bump your chest a few times, [as wonderfully demonstrated by our former captain last season.](http://i.imgflip.com/4l16b.gif) Not too sure about the history of this one, maybe one of the folk who've been around longer than me (or in the Leeds area - I'm a southerner) can help out here.",0,1411652028,null,0,1411657934,0,cks4osi,t3_2hdzau,t1_cks4osi,t3_2hdzau,null,1426830632,24,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,24

It is very unreasonable to assume that India would have simply stop advancing in technology. There is nothing that indicates that technology would have simply stopped moving forward. By that logic modern technologies such as electronics, aviation etc. would not be in India today.

He is not playing both sides at all, saying colonialism was a force of greater good is ridiculous. He went as far to say that Africa is the only place that suffered negatively from Colonialism. The point is most historians would definitely disagree that colonialism was good. You have to be the one to point out why it was good, when all the evidence points to the opposite.

I also care about civil liberties and human rights and the Lib dems are the only ones who actually are in favour of them. Labour introduced horrific terror legislation after 2001 and was integral in creating the GCHQ spying system while the Conservatives have carried it all on the same, tried to pass the communications bill giving the security services much more power (opposed by the Lib dems btw) and they will force us out of the Council of Europe's convention on human rights after 2015. Even Russia is only suspended but we're the ones who'll be first to leave. It's crazy. Both major parties don't give a shit about the liberty of citizens. They'd both rather control you and tell you what you can and can't do. The Lib Dems political philosophy (being about liberalism and liberty) means they are diametrically opposed to that sort of authoritarianism.

The fire engine sat on my tail, flashing his lights, but he was so close that I couldn't see the lights. I took my foot off the accelerator, and moved over a bit after he honked the horn a few times. But there was nowhere else for me to go, and I couldn't slow down without slowing him down or running the risk of him running in to the back of me. The whole situation didn't make any sense.

Eventually he overtook my car, and kept going.

Turns out that I knew who the driver was, and he had recognised my car. The next day the guy had a bit of a shout at me for not pulling over. I told him that I couldn't see the lights because he was right on my tail.

**Price of product:** £1.65 for 200ml

**Where did you purchase:** Superdrug on half price offer

**Product claims:** *""a perfect blend of multi-vitamins and skin-loving ingredients to keep your skin clarified and refreshed. 100% alcohol free, perfect even for sensitive skin.""*

**About you:** Oily skin. Closed Comedones and nasty whiteheads on my chin during hormonal acne. Grr.

**Your opinion:** I wanted to keep using this toner. I actually really liked it! It smelled pleasant, didn't sting when I put it on and I could see that when I used it parts of my skin looked more radiant. Unfortunately, it reacted badly with my acids (sobs). The research tells me flushing occurs, but I've got darker skin so I didn't see any flushing, just really uneven skin texture.

I've been experimenting with where I can put it in my routine to get the full effects, but even when I used it on my skin in the morning with no other acids my skin looked worse by evening. My skin only started improving when I took it out of my routine entirely. As I'm currently dealing with horrible hormonal acne, and my skin never just gets better during it, but that it did, lead me to believe that this really wasn't helping my skin overall. The final nail on the coffin was when a crop of *papules* (don't Google it) on my temples that I had attributed to some medication cleared up once I stopped using it. My skin clearly seems to prefer AHAs and BHAs over what niacinamide can do for it.

Never considered Oxford or Cambridge, because as a working class, publicly educated Scottish teenager I never thought I'd have a chance at getting in, which possibly says something about our society.

Application consisted of a UCAS form and personal statement, nothing too strenuous, though if I had lower grades I might've had to go to an interview.

Work placements in my experience take place between 3rd/4th year in Scotland, 2nd/3rd year in England, and I was lucky enough to get one. If you can get on an ""X with Industrial Experience"" degree course, even better as that gives you a much better chance of finding something. Those will have a full year of relevant work experience.

I graduated with a 1st class MPhys degree with an industrial placement in the middle of the recession, couldn't get a job and the prospect of a career in finance sounded soul-crushing. So I applied for some Postgrad positions that interested me and that's how I ended up here today doing an engineering PhD at Edinburgh.

1. Get drunk, but not so often that you neglect other social activities.
2. Join a fucking sports club or society or something. I didn't in my undergrad because I failed at Top Tip #1 and I regret it to this day.
3. Try not to fall off the wagon with regard to studying if it's easy work. It's difficult to get back into the habit.

Unfortunately the most / only significantly effective strategy SO FAR is gastric surgery. If you go to your GP they probably won't tell you that Volumetrics and Weight Watchers have slightly higher success rates, and Atkins and Detox have pretty poor success rates.

Success rate by the way is looked at by people who have lost and sustained the loss over a 12-24 month period.

But that on it's own doesn't make a good method for learning, which is why there are thousands of educational professionals who work out the best way for people to learn and change the curriculum every year to improve upon that.

Joining the military doesn't *automatically* make you anything.
 
Everyone who joins does so for different reasons, and everyone who serves does so differently. Some do so because they can't do anything else, some do so because they see it as a way to gain skills and education they wouldn't have access to otherwise, some do it because they believe they are protecting their country (they may or may not be in reality, but that doesn't really matter when assessing their intentions).

I've never liked the name ""Help for Heroes"", though. It's far too emotive for one thing and seems to lend itself very easily to the kind of shit the Sun are trying to pull in the linked article. I personally believe that serviceman and their families should be helped, not because they have ""risked their lives to protect their country"" (whether or not this is even the case is a matter of some dispute), but simply because they are people in need. It should never be an issue of political point scoring. 

I also think that if you are going to chuck around the term heroes, you should at least include members of the emergency services.

To a naysayer, any evidence to the contrary would be flawed. 

The Industrial revolution was a technology driven process, but saying that raw materials were not extorted is taking it a bit too far. The fact is that the British, like any other colonial power was interested in profits. The East India Company was a corporation. How could it not be interested in profits? If the raw materials was grown in India, the finished products were manufactured in India and then sold the world over, how would the British get their profits? Saying things like mechanized manufacturing would have never arrived in India without the British is also taking it a bit too far. The British wanted British industries to grow. But the raw materials were not available in Britain. So, they got their raw materials from their colonies. And to make sure that British industries made their profits, they destroyed all forms of competition especially in the colonies. 

You may think of the effects of divide and rule to be revisionist, but its effects are quite real. Divide and Rule is was implemented to make administration easier. Instead of having one unified force standing against you, you divide them so that they bicker among themselves.

false,AimHere,null,null,"Ethnicity isn't wholly defined genetically, but culturally and socially. 

Language, dialect, religious outlook, upbringing, how someone defines themselves nationally, and, to some extent, race, all play a part. Ethnicity comes and goes. Zionism and the Israeli identity was created in the 19th century. The Palestinian ethnic identity was formed in the latter half of the twentieth century. It's a social construct.

You cannot deny that there is a concept of 'Scottishness' that can be distinct from 'Englishness' or whatever. And there are obviously Scots in Scotland both for and against Independence, with the OP contending that the latter were more numerous (which I believe is likely).

Someone of almost totally English upbringing born in Slough who moved to Edinburgh and voted 'Yes' at the referendum is not 'nationalist Scottish person'. That's just silly, but it's the logical corollary to what you said. There might be a grey area for some people as to what their ethnic group is, but that's not the same thing as saying that Scottish or English (or British) ethnicity doesn't exist.

Having said that, bringing up the notion of ethnic Scots is exactly the sort of toxic nationalist shite that the vast bulk of the independence movement has long moved away from, modulo the odd fool like /u/fix_it_mike here (unlike the more scummy parts of the mainstream unionist camp, such as the Daily Mail or the odd Labour MSP), and it's unprecedented success at the referendum (we didn't win, but we made a damn good fight of it!) pretty much vindicates the notion of avoiding that whole ethnicity shitpile altogether.

The BBC decided that one appearance a year on question time was a proportionally fair amount of exposure, considering the popularity of the party. 

The recent failure of the BNP does not have much to do with Griffins appearance on question time. It was actually very well received by his supporters, which is sort of my point, of course most people would say what he said was horrible, but the people who support him, or are considering supporting him saw his performance in a positive light, and appearing on the BBC legitimised what he said. 

The same can be said with Anjem Choudary. Of course most people will disagree with him.

They established alliances sure, but they also fought against and took control of others. That is an invasion, just because they had temporary (and ever changing) local alliances it doesn't mean they weren't invaders. They were a foreign entity that used force (among other methods) to take control and keep control of India. This qualifies the British to be invaders, they were foreign entity that kept control of India through force. 

The identity of India wasn't created by the British. That flies against the British strategy of dividing and conquering. India has been unified geographically multiple times before the British got there. It was the Indians desire to gain Independence that led to its unity. The British sought to keep the country divided, they never wanted India to be a unified independent political entity. There was no concept of ""Indian"" during the British rule, the concept of unity was forged by Indians not the British.

The British ""invested"" in India in order to exploit it, they didn't invest in it in order for us to be independent. What a ridiculous statement, the British rule destroyed the region - it was far from a positive influence. If that where their intention, there would have been no need for an independence. It took countless lives to British were forced out, they didn't simply leave. Why would there be any need for violence and oppression, if the British intended to leave peacefully? You're view on colonialism is simply laughable.

As luck has it, the [YouGov poll](http://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/e1yphtuis8/Final_Prediction_140918_Final_Website.pdf) does provide breakdowns for Scottish, non-Scottish UK, and elsewhere origins.

For people born in Scotland, the result is almost a dead heat, 51% to 49% in favour of No.  Non-Scottish UK go No by 74% to 26%, and non-UK born go no by 59% to 41%.

So I'm afraid it's dead wrong to suggest that the ""vast majority"" of Scottish-born people residing in Scotland voted yes - it's much more likely that they voted No by a very slender majority, which was then strengthened by the votes of all the Scottish residents who weren't born there who do indeed break more strongly towards No.

&gt;The industrial revolution didn't happen like it had in Britain but neither had most of the world at that point.

Which is partly why we were able to take over a good chunk of it - but that was my primary question; why hadn't it happened anyway?

&gt; Has technology stopped advancing in India just because the British were forced out (or the rest of the world)?

Err...how many aspects that I didn't mention are you going to introduce as if I had?

&gt;It is very unreasonable to assume that India would have simply stop advancing in technology.

Again, nobody stated that.

&gt;There is nothing that indicates that technology would have simply stopped moving forward.

There's also no reason to assume it would have advanced at enough of a rate to be competitive.

&gt; By that logic modern technologies such as electronics, aviation etc. would not be in India today.

You're asserting that India invented electronics, aviation etc.? There's a big difference between creating technology and copying someone else's.

Do quote where he demonstrates this, since you're now speaking for him.

&gt;saying colonialism was a force of greater good is ridiculous.

Sure, [what have the Romans ever done for us?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9foi342LXQE).

&gt; You have to be the one to point out why it was good, when all the evidence points to the opposite.

I already have, but I think your agenda might be stopping you from seeing it - it's worth noting (again) that neither he nor I stated that it was all good - but you're the one insisting it was all bad, so list some of the scientific, language, social, engineering and medical benefits introduced that were actually detrimental to India. (The link above shows you how long ago this attitude was addressed).

&gt;Rome vs British empire are two different animals occurring in two different eras. Not even close to being the same.

Both invaded, both brought good and bad elements (technology/ enslavement, for example), and when both left they *didn't* take a lot of the good elements with them, which was good for Britain after the Romans, and India after the British Empire.  That's already enough parallels to make your statement more about you than the matter at hand.

1) Inaccuracy. I checked your links; there are 114 Surahs in the Koran, and I don't think they got more than half there. A good few, to be fair, but not ""most"" - though I didn't count, and several appear more than once. So to say ""most Surahs"" would probably be inaccurate. ""Practically every"" is *definitely* wrong.

2) Misleading. Some chapters are really short (as short as three verses), some are really long; so saying ""most Surahs"" gives us no real data to work on even if it's true. What %age of verses contain such stuff?

3) Misleading part II. The definition of ""Unbeliever"" is a little ambiguous in the Koran. At times, Jews and Christians are ""People of the Book"" and believers. At other times, they don't appear to be. Ambiguity is one of the problems which gives rise to fundamentalism. Heh; so much for the ""perfect book"".

4) Specificness. You said later that you'd say the same of the CoE: good! That's consistent. But it sounded at first like you were singling out Islam, and there are lots of nutters who like to do that.

Me, I stick to calling ""dogma"" the problem, as that's nice and clear and covers all the bases. Islam seems more prone to dogma that the other two Abrahamic religions at this point in history. There's lots of possible reasons for that, and I think I agree with what somebody said earlier (may have been you) that they basically need a Reformation.

I'm not saying that Griffin's appearance on Question Time per se was the reason for the BNP being in the doldrums now but I think that by giving him the airtime it sort of diluted a lot of the potential for woe is me, we're being discriminated against because they don't want you to hear the truth tripe and that takes the sheen off of what he says.

Those who lionised Griffin in the aftermath of his appearance were probably already inclined to vote BNP and agree with his views anyway but I have more faith in the British public than to think he won many people over- certainly not enough to shore up the BNP's position on the political landscape for longer than the blip that they enjoyed in the limelight. 

And that has parallels with Choudary.

I'm sure Muslims will attest to not liking him because he just talks so much crap in front of cameras at the most unhelpful of times. Those who feed off what he says will no doubt eat up his ramblings but I sense a backlash against him from other Muslims who are just fed up of his being put at the forefront of the debate whenever an event occurs that warrants input from the Muslim community.

In this case, of course, we are looking at WW1 propaganda - if it was ever indeed promoted deliberately as propaganda - and the story could easily take a look at the nature of propaganda with this as an example. If the British had developed some kind of Space/Time visualiser that could project historical images across the battlefield for propaganda purposes, but in doing so it caused massive disruption to the original timeline, maybe the Doctor would turn up, stop the horror-from-beyond-time from slithering through and then give them a good talking to, or something.  

More widely though, since the show is British, it is hardly surprising that historical episodes that are currently seen as important or interesting in British history are often dealt with. Personally, I would love to see more historical stories set elsewhere in the world - outside Europe altogether, really, which would go some way to mitigating this.

If you look at the new system it is a fairer alternative. Most people who hate the lib dems still have no clue how the new system actually works. I missed it by a year and I honestly wish I didn't. I'm not going to explain it, someone else undoubtedly has much better.

Still not going to vote lib dem because they have like less than 1% support where I live, but I consider Nick Clegg to be the biggest political matyr in modern history, and I respect him for doing the right thing even when it spelled certain doom for his political career.

I went because at the school I attended (very posh, I was there on a scholarship) it was just expected that you would, we weren't really presented with any other options. So, almost on a whim, I decided to do a Performing Arts course because I did Drama at A Level and quite liked it. I chose the university because my school careers advisor suggested it and it was far enough away from home to feel like I was independent but not so far that I actually had to be independent, in other words I could pop back for odd weekend to get my washing done and my belly filled. As you can tell, I didn't take the whole thing very seriously because I was young and more than a little foolish. Had tuition fees been a thing back in my day I probably would have put a bit more thought into it.

My course was a lot of fun but all it really achieved was to confirm that it wasn't what I wanted to do with my life. I wasted my first year messing about, as a lot of people did. Fortunately the first year didn't count towards my degree. I pulled my socks up in the second year and third year and ended up with a 2:1 but to be honest I could have done better if i'd been passionate enough about the subject to really put the work in. 

So I graduated having had a good time, made some good friends but not actually trained for anything that anyone wanted to pay me for. I worked in a variety of jobs such as retail, catering, office stuff etc. then eventually ended up as a Support Worker for people with Learning Disabilities and Mental Health Problems. I loved it immediately and realised that was what I wanted to do with my life so I went back to Uni, worked my arse of this time, and graduated as a Registered Mental Health Nurse. 

My second degree was a lot more demanding but I actually found it much easier because I loved it, knew it was what I wanted to do as a career and had (hopefully) grown up enough to appreciate the opportunity. I suppose the moral of the story is, if you're going to spend three years of your life at uni with all the hard work and financial strain that comes with it, try to pick a subject that you actually give a shit about. On the other hand, if you do pick the wrong path it's never to late to put it right.

But think about how few supporters Anjem Choudary actually has. Far fewer than Nick Griffin or the BNP, and yet he has many more tv and radio appearances. 

Perhaps Nick Griffin was allowed on tv to appease the BNP's followers, but it doesn't not make sense for Choudary  to be allowed on tv for the same reason. He has a tiny number of actual followers in comparison. 

Even if Choudary's supporters did complain, what would they be complaining about? That their views that it is acceptable for Muslims to behead people in the streets, and that no one should feel sorry for someone who is kidnapped and executed on tv, aren't being given enough airtime? Nobody is complaining about that because they know that their views are unacceptable in this country, and often boarder on illegal. All that allowing Choudary on tv does is give people who do hold these views a sense that they are not the only one who feels this way. And allowing him on tv more often than a moderate Muslim just gives the impression that there are more Muslims out there that believe those things than there actually are.

I got into UCL as well but really wanted to move out of London and live on my own, plus Warwick has a great reputation too. I didn't really know what to do and it was pretty much a toss up between Chemistry and Biology (even though I got the A star in Bio), but chose chemistry for my back ups as it was more challenging.

Got to Warwick did Chemsitry for a month and really couldn't be bothered with the work, so transferred degree streams over to biological sciences. Was on the whole pretty much a cake walk from there on, just memorising for exams really. Just a warning, I found the transition from a2 to first year not so big, but the transition from 1st year to 2nd year was almost overwhelming as it got significantly harder. The key thing I realised from uni is that everyone is there to help you get a better grade. Warwick was massively lenient to me and others and it's one of the best Uni's in the country, they let us get away with so much bullshit and excuses. I didn't really do much at uni work wise, since bio didn't require much contact time and revision could be done completely from slides. Only work I did through the year were lab reports, and some tutorials as only half were compulsory and for credit. I did a lot, a lot of socialising and going out and played football and cricket for the uni. Obviously it depends on what you're doing but I even had mates who did MORSE and straight maths, supposedly the hardest degrees from any uni in the country, regularly going out. You just have to be clever with how you manage your time, and be prepared to have no life in the 2 months leading up to exams. I can say I did significantly less work at three years at uni than 2 years at A-level and, I left with a high 2:1.

If you're view is that Britain's colonization of India was good for India, then it is simply not true . India suffered economically and politically under the British, its people were oppressed. Whatever innovations that were made in India were primarily made to exploit India, not for its benefit.

I don't support factory farming, I try to source my meat responsibly. I'm actually quite sad and/or angry when I hear about tragedies affecting humans as well. And so on. 

Throughout the article she is beating away at a strawman, while reducing all her arguments to absurd conclusions. It's disgraceful and insulting and she should fuck off, quite frankly. 

If she's looking for a reason that this incident raised so much money, here's a few off the top of my head:

* Unlike farming animals for food, this attack was born out of pure malice. 
* Unlike disease or war or other instances of ongoing suffering, this was a problem we knew we could do something about. We knew exactly what needed to be done and where the money would go.
* Many of us have dogs and can understand how terrified and confused they would be to die in a fire.

That's because terrorism is not a side, a nation, a people or object of any kind - it is an asymmetrical warfare tactic used by people who would be ordinarily overpowered in a traditional battle.

Fighting a War Against Terror is as effective as calling for a War Against Violence... both are a symptom of warfare, not a root cause (but both lead to extreme reactions that further or prolong warfare so it's easy to misdiagnose as a cause).

Terrorism is also a guaranteed effective slow-burn weapon against an opposing nation/oppressive government. It literally causes the other side to eat itself from the inside out; by provoking a government to impose disruption, confusion and misery upon the lives of it's people on a scale that surpasses what a small fighting force could ever hope to achieve with traditional warfare tactics.",0,1411657517,null,0,false,0,cks7479,t3_2hetzv,t1_cks7479,t1_cks0r00,null,1426829500,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

false,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;As for why it hadn't happened anyway? There would be many reasons, Britain was simply ahead of most of the world at that time.

Indeed, but that's the reason for the parallel with the Romans - most brits (certainly the Iceni) would agree that we'd have all be happier without them, but on the other hand they rapidly upgraded almost everything and saved us a lot of time in doing it. Hence his example of the Great Wall - not nice if you had to build it, very nice if you didn't.

&gt;I'm not asserting that electronics was invented in India, I'm simply stating that technology kept on advancing.

But not at the rate it would have on their own. If it were, that would have happened before then. Why is this a bad thing?

&gt;Britain didn't create electronics/aviation either, technology is learned and innovated by everyone.

That's a bad path to start down. Shall we begin with the [television, telephone and world wide web?](http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/15-best-british-tech-inventions-ever-548346). India made a good amount of discoveries on its' own, but it's not quite in the same league, really.

&gt;What the Roman's did to Britain and what the British did to India two are different things.

But similar enough to hold, which is why I then stated 'That's already enough parallels to make your statement more about you than the matter at hand'. So explain why the parallels don't hold - if anything, the brits would have had it worse under the Romans.

&gt;They occurred in completely different era in different ways.

With ultimately the same result.

&gt;If you are view is that Britain's colonization of India was good for India, then it is simply not true

You keep saying that without substantiating it (or even addressing the benefits I and others have listed). Simply saying 'we would have done that anyway' isn't enough.

&gt;Whatever innovations that were made in India were primarily made to exploit to India not for its benefit.

Just like the Romans did in the UK. I think I've already pointed that out.

false,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;But Choudary's media exposure is based on the relative importance and impact of Islamic extremism in Britain today. 

You mean Choudary gets media exposure because there is lots of Muslim extremism going on and the media wants the opinion of a religious extremist? I don't believe that is the reason. 

&gt;Griffin was a flash in the pan reaction against the Establishment that we see time and time again which takes the form of UKIP in its latest incarnation.

I think UKIP is a very good example of how negative media coverage can help someone's cause. Interviews with UKIP have almost always been negative, yet there is no doubt they have helped their image, as people who like what Farage has to say will listen to him, even if the interviewer is negative towards him. This gives the whole moment momentum. 

&gt;I think Choudary is allowed media access both to stop his supporters claiming he's being silenced so nullifying marty status

Again, I think that could be easily be achieved by giving him one appearance a year, like the BBC chose to do with the BNP. Why then does Choudary get dozens of appearances every year even though his following is much much smaller? 

&gt;also to dispel myths he espouses when appealing to moderate but potentially targetable Muslim demographics (young, disenfranchised Muslim men) as if to prove he's not as credible as they may feel had they only been fed information according to his agenda and not through the prism of the mainstream media where he can be challenged.

I disagree with this as well. Very rarely does he appear alongside other moderate Muslims. It is rarely a case of his cause being presented alongside a moderate Muslims, he almost always appears as the ONLY Muslim voice, and it is left to the interviewer or other non Muslim guests to claim that he does not represent the views of all Muslims. However, that message obviously looses a lot of its impact when it is non Muslims saying it to a Muslim. 

&gt;That freedom of expression and other democratic values are meaningless when the gist opposes the 'acceptable' line (as theirs does) thus undermining the dichotomy between what he and his supporters see as the hypocrisy of the West and their 'truths'.

I'd love to see that read out on points of view!

http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Obesity/Pages/Causes.aspx[1]
Lists two medical reasons for obesity, one that affects every 1 in 1000 men and the other there are only about 60 known cases of per year!
So whilst my 99.9% may have been a bit over the top - you can probably round it down to 99.8%

Your whole post is the Dunning-Kruger fallacy writ large.  

There are two facets to the obesity epidemic to consider: the societal reasons for energy excess that drive the epidemic at a population level, and the individual variances that influence obesity risk at a personal level. Both of these interact and combine to alter the risk of obesity in every individual in the country.

With regards to ""medical reasons for obesity"", I can assure you there are a huge number of genetic variances that alter an individuals risk of obesity.  Have a look [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics_of_obesity) for a small, incomplete snapshot.  The majority of these variances induce obesity risk by altering how our appetite works, such as the MC4R polymorphism.  Their presence literally makes your sensation of hunger greater.  Note I'm not arguing for any violation of thermodynamics - just, that the sensations of hunger and satiety are defined by biochemical processes that can be drastically different between individuals.

These polymorphisms don't even include my area of research, epigenetic modification of genes, which can introduce another layer of variance.

Just to illustrate the power genetics has on obesity propensity at an individual level, [research](http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v34/n1/abs/ijo2009177a.html) has demonstrated a far greater correlation between the BMI of adopted children and their biological parents than their adoptee parents.

The above factors dictate the inter-individual variance seen in obesity risk.  However, the population as a whole has also experienced a massive increase in obesity risk, driven by changing environmental pressures, which really should be fairly obvious - aggressive marketing and abundance of cheap, low quality food, lack of dietary education, low levels of physical activity throughout the course of the day.

Of course our genes haven't changed substantially over the last few decades (well, [classically anyway](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1471-0528.2006.00989.x/full)), so why has the prevalence of obesity increased? It isn't because we've got ""lazier"" or somehow ""lost willpower"" to eat less or exercise more.  It's because the environment we live in is exerting ever greater pressures on us to become obese, and our bodies, evolutionarily designed to intake and store maximal amounts of energy, are not built to take this into account.

&gt;Curing obesity isn't done with a pill or an injection, it takes will power and effort. Many people just don't care and are happy to be fat.

Curing obesity will NEVER happen this way, and it's a fallacy to claim people don't care.  The only fool-proof and effective method of weight loss in the literature is bariatric surgery.  Losing weight is fucking hard.  The only way we will beat the obesity epidemic is either a miracle anti-hunger pill (Steve Bloom @ Imperial is working on some interesting inhibitors of gastric hunger signals, but they are years away from marker) or a widespread knuckling down on the societal causes of obesity.",0,1411659040,null,0,false,0,cks7v52,t3_2hey7d,t1_cks7v52,t1_cks32qo,null,1426829150,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

false,shortpaleugly,null,null,"&gt;You mean Choudary gets media exposure because there is lots of Muslim extremism going on and the media wants the opinion of a religious extremist? I don't believe that is the reason.

I don't actually think there's a lot of extremism *per se* but the effects are so far-reaching that it's easy for us to think that- as you said earlier far more Muslims oppose Choudary than support both because they think his views abhorrent but also because they frankly have too much to deal with day-to-day to give a shit about what he says. The boring, mundane travails of life like worrying about their kids' educations, putting food on the table, rising energy bills and all the other soul-sapping realities of life detract from efforts to speak up, as it were, against men like him. A fatigue sets in when constantly having to defend yourself from suggestions of alliance merely through shared labels.

I think that his media exposure serves to put him in front of the public as a figure of hate- someone for the collective to direct anger at in the aftermath of a terrorist attack, for example. Someone to come along and present the type of delusion that perpetrators carry and to be challenged and exposed for the ludicrousness and fallacy that it is.

&gt;I think UKIP is a very good example of how negative media coverage can help someone's cause. Interviews with UKIP have almost always been negative, yet there is no doubt they have helped their image, as people who like what Farage has to say will listen to him, even if the interviewer is negative towards him. This gives the whole moment momentum.

I think the momentum comes from someone finally addressing concerns that weren't being dealt with or confronted by the mainstream though. As you say, it reinforces the opinions of those who *already* support him but on the flip-side I don't think he'll be around for long once the mainstream acknowledges his keynotes as issues and then renders his appeal null because he's a one issue man with little staying power.

As with Choudary he's given fuel by appealing to the victimhood that his supporters feel but once they're allowed to speak freely they can't cling to that anymore and their support eventually abates and dissipates.

&gt;Why then does Choudary get dozens of appearances every year even though his following is much much smaller?

Because with Griffin we were talking about politics- a failure of the Establishment and the main parties to acknowledge grievances a significant portion of the British public had about immigration but with Choudary we're talking about a different animal in Islamic extremism.

Something that has and has the capability of having deadly consequences.

&gt;he almost always appears as the ONLY Muslim voice, and it is left to the interviewer or other non Muslim guests to claim that he does not represent the views of all Muslims. However, that message obviously looses a lot of its impact when it is non Muslims saying it to a Muslim.

I actually agree with you here in that I think more moderate Muslims should be given airtime alongside Choudary to give credence to the stance that most Muslims in Britain take which is not aligned in any way, shape or form to that which he claims ""true"" Islam offers.

That's a very real shortcoming with the approach but again I think it just becomes tiring after a while for Muslims to have to defend themselves and distance themselves from him when they shouldn't be lumped in with him by default so maybe that's one reason why many would rather stay out of it.",0,1411660154,null,0,false,0,cks8fo0,t3_2hexpt,t1_cks8fo0,t1_cks7r1i,null,1426828884,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

So in your point of view, technological advancements happen equally? It is not a ""bad thing"" when you look at it by itself, it is a bad thing when you look at the big picture. 

&gt;That's a bad path to start down. Shall we begin with the television, telephone and world wide web?. India made a good amount of discoveries on its' own, but it's not quite in the same league, really.

Define league, Most Indo-Euopean languages are derived from Sanskrit. India contributed the number system, the decimal system, the pascal triangle, surgery, anesthesia, etc. Without the number system, you don't get modern computers. Innovations have occurred in different eras, there is no way to compare them. They are all inter-related, without number system you don't get computers, without computers you dont get the world wide web, without the world wide web many current/future innovations wouldn't be possible.

&gt;With ultimately the same result.

No, colonization has been negative for India. It is a logical fallacy to assume that Rome/Britain is good, therefore Britain/India is good.

Multiple historians have addressed why, even if you are to look at it purely economically: 

&gt;At the beginning of the 18th century India's share of the world economy was 23%, as large as all of Europe put together. By the time we won independence, it had dropped to less than 4%. The reason was simple: India was governed for the benefit of Britain. Britain's rise for 200 years was financed by its depredations in India.

&gt;the population of Dhaka, which was once the great centre of muslin production, fell by 90%. So instead of a great exporter of finished products, India became an importer of British ones, while its share of world exports fell from 27% to 2%. 

This is merely one example of how the British exploitation of India had left its infrastructure in shambles. Whatever ""benefits"" you are listing came at the overall cost of India's economy and freedom.

If India's economy hadn't slowed down to a crawl during the British rule, India would have made technological advancements at a much higher rate than what is happening right now.",0,1411660446,null,0,1411660693,0,cks8kzg,t3_2hb64z,t1_cks8kzg,t1_cks7enu,null,1426828816,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Q2; I think Mata is my favourite manchester utd player and it's sad that LVG doesn't seem to agree. I keep up with his blog he seems like the kind of guy you want to know, he's very talented and is a great player to have in the hole. I don't hate any of them but i think Rooney is overrated. lvg's answer to him not playing well upfront is to take mata's place in attacking midfield?! massive mistake for me, i feel like he's only in the pitch because he's captain, like Nolan for us and Gerrard for Liverpool.

Q3: I don't think Reid will leave, i believe he will sign an extension with us eventually. as for going to utd? certainly at present you'd be lucky to have him, but i feel like he'd struggle to hold his spot once you start splashing the cash for defenders. i'd value him at 8m.

Q4: I'm sure LVG is right for UTD but i honestly think had Moyes been given the same money and time he could have been great for you, i think the club should be ashamed for the way they treated him 

Q5: having Kouyate out is a big blow for us but i'm sure we have the depth to cover for him. Having our record signing and captain out? huge blessing. we play far better with Noble as captain and without Nolan slowing our midfield down, on top of this Sakho and Valencia are proving to be excellent in front of goal. you have it worse in the way of injury's.

false,aoeuisnthd,null,null,"OK. I'll bite:

1) Our current form is fantastic but it remains to be seen whether or not that will hold. I think it safe to say we've all been thoroughly impressed by Sam's work thus far, but there's a lot of variables that will impact this, like  Carroll and Nolan coming back, or potential injuries, or whatnot.  I'd guess 6th-12th for us. 

Near as I can tell with Man U, you lot have two major issues: first, your defense is in shambles. Not exactly a secret, and we'll be looking to exploit that. 

Second - and here I delve into conjecture - the problem last season for you guys by all accounts was that ""Moyes lost the dressing room."" I'm reading now that Spanish is starting to dominate your dressing room in spite of LVG's insistence on using English. This seems small, but communication is really as basic as things get. It's not that I think  LVG is losing the players, but that it's going to take longer than he seems to have hoped for everyone to get on the same page. That's going to hinder you lot. I'd guess 8th to 14th depending on how long your guys take to gel. 

2) No opinion one way or the other. 

3) Go fuck yourselves. You can't have him. 

Alternatively: nah, he's terrible. You guys don't want him. 

If we get him to sign again, I doubt we'd be willing to let him go. Would have to be a pretty sizeable worm on the hook. 

4) You guys sacked Moyes too quickly, full stop. Ferguson had better than two decades to build his dynasty. You need to better manage your expectations, because it's wholly unrealistic to have expected a new manager to come in with a different method of doing things, and still bring stellar results while using his predecessor's acquisitions. 

That said, the blame isn't entirely on your board. Moyes shouldn't have sacked the backroom so quickly to bring his own people in like he did. 

On topic: Van Gaal is a talented manager, but you lot are going to have to be patient with him. 

5) The majority of us view Carroll and Nolan's absences as a good thing as far as actual football goes. Kouyate's presence will be missed, but we have sufficient depth for his role. 

6) Stab in the dark? It's going to be a high scoring game, I think. 4-2 to the Hammers.  Your attackers are top notch, but your midfield and defense will get wrecked if we play like we did vs Hull and Pool.

4)Van Gaal will be the manager to put Man Utd at the top again. He needs to be given time to pick the team up from last season, bring in new players and mold the team to his tactics and style. After that Man Utd will be laughing.

5)Nolan and Carroll being out is a blessing. It's allowed us to use more of our new signings who have been superb and helped us get the decent start we've had. We'll miss Kouyate but we've got enough depth to the squad to still put out a solid team even with injuries across the field.

Most migrants may well come to work, but do they come with jobs lined up already? Do they come with skills that we actually need? We have a plethora of young school/university graduates who need jobs who could work in many positions that migrants fill. Meanwhile we have skills shortages in the STEM areas in particular. We should be looking to fill those gaps. Not make it even harder for young people to find jobs than it already is.

&gt; freedom of movement is fine between countries of similar economic standing

That may be so. But of the EU28, how many countries are of a ""similar economic standing?"" 

Perhaps...5, 6? Looking at the GDP per capita (Purchasing power parity) I might go so far as 10. But then Luxembourg, Finland, Ireland and Belgium (4 of the smallest countries by population) are included in that. 

So perhaps we could make agreements with those nations to make it easier for their citizens to move here. But the other 17 nations will (and do) drag us down. And we can put restrictions in place to ensure we only get the best candidates from those.

&gt; What would the implications of this be? A giant tax hole and exacerbating the rising inequality. Personally, I think £325,000 is already pretty generous.

£4bn, which can be recuperated from leaving the EU for 73 days. 

And far from it. 90% of my grandfather's estate was taken by the tax man. 90% of his money which had already been taxed when he earned it, and would've been taxed again if any of the inheritors had spent it. Why should the tax man get any of it? The redistribution has been done when he earned it. His house was his own, why should that be redistributed? It's disgusting. Robbing from the middle classes. The super-rich can get round it with their semi-legal accounting. The middle-classes are the ones that are hit.

&gt; Leave the EU.

Pretty common sense in my opinion. Save £55M/day. Be able to control our own laws. Trading with the EU is slowing while we are trading more and more outside the EU, but we can't make free-trade agreements individually. If we leave the EU we can go and make free trade agreements with whoever we want (like...idk, emerging economics such as India, Brazil, Russia, China, Mexico, and Nigeria?), bringing in more trade. The rules are stupid but they're a non-issue, as you say. Although we can get rid of them for ourselves which would be nice.

Equally we wouldn't lose many, if any jobs (and any lost would be more than replaced by non-EU trading jobs), don't be absolutely ridiculous. We would still trade with the EU, that is really a non-sensical argument. London is one of, if not the most important financial hubs in the world, with massive stock &amp; shares indexes. Europe will trade with us regardless. 

I am not a fan of the freedom of movement. I'm sure as part of the negotiations, all ex-pats will be granted permanent leave to remain in their given countries. You can very easily move abroad, if you so choose, without open borders. Just apply for a visa, if you want to move that much. It's not difficult. But it removes the moving on a whim element, which I think is a good thing. (Also removes the hoardes of people coming to the UK for a better standard of living but unable to contribute to an overall increase in economic output).

As for CAP, it's created over-supply problems, and artificially boosted food prices. I don't see the need for it, personally.

And RDF? We can create our own. HS2 being scrapped would help that.

The hunting &amp; smoking bans are not a priority for me. I'm far from a fan of smoking. Hunting I don't know enough about to be honest, although I think in principle, with the right restrictions, I don't see why it shouldn't be allowed.

&gt; Increase defense spending and buy 3 aircraft carriers

Well...we need them. Yes these things are expensive. But laughing at them without saying why it's not possible is hardly constructive.

£6.2bn for HMS Queen elizabeth. So we could get one HS2, or 7 aircraft carriers. Obviously this is not how the accounting in the treasury works. I'm simply demonstrating how funds can very easily be reallocated in-line with their promises.

Which leads me to the other issues you ignored (full list found [here](http://www.ukip.org/issues)):

Yes, the debt and deficit did increase after 2010: you can't simply cut billions overnight, it doesn't work that way. Actions taken need to be gradual and thus need time to bear fruit, as they now are.

You're being ridiculed because of the very partisan, very unwarranted anti-Tory slant you're putting onto a state of affairs that are largely Labour's doing.

Had Labour won in 2010, the debt would still have went up, and Labour's manifesto for 2010 included major cuts of their own. They'd have been trying to fix the mess as well, and would be doing no better than the current Government.

false,[deleted],null,null,"Well, I finished my IB with good grades (34/45) but unfortunately not with the right mixture of grades from my six subjects to go to either UCL or KCL, my first and second choices for Geography. I went through clearing and ended up at Leicester, largely because of a guarantee of accommodation and because it was a relatively good university for my subject, as well as being highly rated for student satisfaction.

First year I worked really hard for no real reason, given that it didn't count. As an IB student I was already quite used to academic referencing and writing essays at a suitable level, so it wasn't much of an adjustment, and in hindsight I don't know why I tried so hard to perform academically but didn't give any of the societies a chance. I did try the hiking society for a day but found it very hard to gel with people. I still do, actually, despite having a lot more social experience.

Second year I moved in with some lovely people, and we had a blast together at home but I still didn't do much outside of that. Didn't help that they were together, always made going out a little bit awkward, as if I was the very definition of a third wheel. 

Come to the end of the second year and I felt burnt out. I hadn't enjoyed any of the modules in the second semester and performed quite badly in two. Most of the content felt regurgitated. One lecturer spent most of his time showing photos from field trips. After a terrible time trying to do some independent fieldwork for my dissertation on a bog in Galway, I dropped out at the beginning of the third year.

I've spent the past three years studying towards an Open Degree with the Open University, having transferred in 240 credits from Leicester. I finish on October 10th, probably with a 2:2. Given that grade boundaries are roughly one up over all bricks and mortar universities, with a First at 85%, 2:1 at 70% and 2:2 at 55%, I'll be quite happy with that, but at no point in the last five years has it seemed clear to me what I should actually do with this degree. I do have a job but it's nothing I want to continue with.

A few things:

1. If you're not very sociable, like me, I would **strongly** recommend taking a gap year to get some life experience before university. There was a big difference in attitude in my year between those who had spent that time away and those who had jumped straight into university. I'm planning on going travelling after Christmas, but I think having done that sooner would have made life a lot easier at university.

2. Take every opportunity. In hindsight, I had loads of great opportunities to make friends and talk to my lecturers, but saw myself as too socially awkward, as an outsider, to take them. Not taking those routes is a great way to isolate yourself, but that's not a good idea when you're in the hyper-social environment of university.

3. Work smart. Something I'm still terrible at is prioritising notes and work, despite three years of independent study. Don't just write down everything and hope it will stick, find a time-saving way of making notes that will be useful in revision and essays.

After all that, could I recommend going to university? Yes, anyone can, maybe not everyone should. For a subject like design it's not an absolute pre-requisite but it should be very helpful in building a portfolio. Seek employment and experiences outside of your comfort zone, use some of that Sixth Form/College free time to get some work experience.

If you don't let them back in, you're rendering them de facto stateless which is questionable. You're also missing a great propaganda opportunity (look isis, you suck so bad people are fleeing your cause for the West).  
  
If you let them in and detain them, you have to charge them with a crime. Good luck figuring out what they did overseas that you can charge them for in Britain. You can hold them without charging them, but that's a whole other civil liberty can of worms.

&gt;**How did you pick you your uni and course?**

*By taking a few years out. I was originally planning to go to Lincoln to study Psychology which was a subject I loved in GCSE, A Levels gradually beat that out of me to the point where I just stopped caring. I took Psychology, Sociology and Law and left college with a CCD. I got into my second choice which was London South Bank to do Clinical Psychology. I went up for an open day and hated it so I decided to take some time out to work.*

*I worked at a supermarket for a year while I tried to figure out what I wanted. No offence to retail workers but that was great incentive to sort myself out. I HATE working retail. It so happened that some business associates of my Dad's needed a website built and they came to me because I'd done tech support for them in the past and I'm 'good with that computer stuff.' So I took a week off work sick and taught myself to build websites and really enjoyed it. Like, it was the first thing in a few years that I actually enjoyed doing. The website was shit, but the client was happy and commissioned me to do some logo and general branding work for them which was also a blast to do. When UCAS application time came around it made sense to apply to some design schools because I could actually imagine doing it until I retire.*

&gt;**What was the process like applying to a university?**

*For me, probably a bit different to usual. I did the normal UCAS stuff and applied to three different Universities. Two of them declined my application at the first stage because while I met their point requirements I didn't have any art or design background that met their criteria (which I'm still bitter about, but whatever.) and the other place gave me an interview. I went to the interview with the world's smallest portfolio on my iPad and basically just shot the shit with the lecturer who told me that they couldn't offer me a place with my current portfolio.*

*Either I'm a silver tongued devil or they saw some potential but they agreed to give me a sample project brief from the course, if I could complete it to a satisfactory standard within a few months they'd offer me a place. I guess I did alright because I go into third year on Tuesday.*

&gt;**What exactly do you do at university?**

*Graphic Design and Communication BA Hons*

&gt;**What is after university - can you look for work placement in your 2nd year?**

*On any design course worth its salt you'll be encouraged to do work. Sometimes lecturers will bring in live briefs for you to work on or bring you job opportunities but you should be able to find freelance gigs. After Uni is your choice, and it really depends on what area of design you're interested in. Personally I like the sound of moving abroad and working with interfaces.* 

&gt;**Anything you wish you knew before hand?**

*Use and abuse every resource at your disposal. My initial line of thought was that I want to pursue digital design so traditional methods aren't useful and therefore must be pointless. Nope. If you're aspiring to be a digital designer lose this mindset immediately. Actually taking the time learn how things used to be done is incredibly powerful for learning how things are done now, and how to do things more effectively. It sounds stupid to say, but learning the fundamentals of all aspects of your field will make you a much better designer. I don't know how I didn't get this.*

*Use and abuse every resource at your disposal. This is so important that I'm going to say it again, now with more reasons! When you graduate there's an incredibly high chance that you won't have access to a screen printing studio (for free). You also probably won't have access to a typesetting machine, a ([really cool](http://img.groundspeak.com/waymarking/cea74016-c1fa-4ba6-b1a9-f873a6748677.JPG)) Royal Colombian press, a 3D printer, a laser cutter, a library full of books and a building full of academics. Make. The. Most. Of. These. Resources. You will miss them. Also, you know what else? Your lecturers get to choose who's work is presented at D&amp;AD at the end of third year. You know who's at D&amp;AD? Employers, and lots of them. People notice when you put the work in. If you are inquisitive and make it very clear that you're at University to make the most of it people will notice. The inverse is also true- if you don't go to lectures and don't work hard they will not care. You will not be noticed and you won't get the favorable attention. If you're as lazy as me you will need to completely change the way your brain works. Do it in the first year because it's really fucking hard to do.*

&gt;**Who has studied design and what are your experiences?**

&gt;**Is it worth it, I have heard that you can learn most of it by yourself and experiences are more important?**

*I think the above sums up my experiences pretty well but there are a few things I will add, most are pertinent to your second question. Yes, you can learn most of it online. Probably the most input towards learning programs my lecturers have given is a subscription to Lynda.com. Software is so incredibly easy to learn that beyond the basics they might not teach you that. But that isn't why you're there. You're there to become a better designer. When you get in you get in because you have okay taste, you know vaguely what looks good and you'll spend the next three years building on that. It may be hard to work out in your first year why learning semiotics and art history are important but believe me, they are. Learn to use constructive criticism as a tool rather than viewing as an attack and you'll go a lot further.*  


&gt;**Does a degree really increase your earning potential, especially in something like design?
Any other tips?**

*Honestly, I'm not sure. There was a time when you would get an apprenticeship or just straight up go it alone but that seems to be a really tough option now. A degree will get your foot in the door and your portfolio will do the rest for you. Seriously, work on that portfolio.*

This got super long but I'm not really sure there's a TL;DR version. Most of it is mistakes I made and why you shouldn't make them but in the long run I'd say this: If you're passionate about design then do it. The idea of being able to something you love for the next few decades and get paid for it is an amazing prospect.

But I'm under no illusions about people a decade or two older than me having it worse.

&gt;The majority of Sikhs and Hindus that came here pre 80s were of Punjabi origin, whereas alot of the Pakistani's I believe were of Mirpuri descent, an area which is much more poverty stricken than Punjab ( I haven't done personal reading on this so not sure of the details)

The main distinction here to my mind is religiosity. Pakistani Muslims are more conservative and religious than are Indian Sikhs and Hindus who are more focused on education and achievement in the business and professional spheres.

Though they probably hold degrees and such to a greater extent, a great deal of Sikhs and Hindus here came without much education at all. The distinction between the two groups in terms of deprivation is explained, in my opinion, by the emphasis Pakistanis place on theological study rather than academic.

That, combined with a more liberal outlook that affords Sikh and Hindu girls more of an opportunity to engage in the workplace and in higher education will explain a lot.",0,1411666154,null,0,false,0,cksbjqs,t3_2hexpt,t1_cksbjqs,t1_cksavj1,null,1426827364,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

You can bin all the competition you want, nobody is still going to come in the numbers needed to make up the shortfill we have in middle grade posts and service needs.  Nowhere near enough people of all professions to fill all of the rota slots needed if this or any government wants to push through ""7 day working"".  The lure of the other english speaking countries is that whilst the renumeration might not be better, the allowances for training and working culture is a massive improvement on the one here, which is to work everything to the limit ""for service"".  There was a time where we'd fill up many of the middle grade positions by nicking doctors from 3rd world countries but those years are long gone now that ""they've"" figured that it's just plain nicer to work somewhere else.  Locum agencies make a killing based on this shortfall.

The rise in pay scale is also not an arbitary thing - with every step up - it is effectively a promotion - with all the added responsibilities that falls to a doctor of increasing seniority.  Work your way up from FY1 - FY2 (bam, have a load of extra responsibility), to CT1 (bam, have a load more).  You seem to suggest that the pay scale is paying us more to do the same work...it really isn't.  Not in a training game where are comtinual and yearly evaluations of what you've done to learn more and better yourself as a doctor.  All expected to be done in your own time - mind.

AS for your accusation that I'm out of touch?  I'm from a council estate, I grew up with jack shit and I do look at the world around me, I see them on the wards that I work and in the people that I clerk as well as the people I used to goto school with.  I work longer hours than my schoolfriends do, I was at university for longer, and thus accrued more debt to pay back.  All for a salary that isn't THAT much more than when I was working at my local cinema.  I'm not crying that I'm poor, but that to suggest that we are ""lucky"" to get what we're given is just silly - we worked hard for our luck here.

The one point I will agree with you on is that yes, the pension is pretty good, the possible one good thing left, but the private sector got shafted on pensions and decided to blame those who were able to protect their pensions, rather than those who shafted them in the first place.

I've heard multiple theories about why Arsenal have it so bad, but I don't really know. Some of the reasons I've heard are:

- Wenger doesn't like to rotate players much

- Wenger's urge to play younger players leads to them peaking earlier

- Wenger only buys a certain small/technical type of player who tends to be more frail

- Because of Arsenal's size teams know they can beat Arsenal by playing overly physical

- Due to the high number of injuries, players are rushed back before they are ready

- Due to the high number of injuries, players are played out of position in roles that don't physically suit them

- Wenger is a closet Chelsea fan who likes to beat Arsenal players with a sack of frozen oranges while they sleep

Oppose the government? You're a Jewish spy, you get disappeared and/or killed. Oppose the local jihadist group? Clearly an Israeli sympathiser, off with your head. 

The hatred for Israel is such that anyone who is branded an Israeli sympathiser can no longer be taken seriously by the wider community, consequently moderates get shafted and extremists drive the political discourse. 

You can see the same in any authoritarian state. Look at how Hamas has managed to keep power in Gaza despite turning the place into a crater every few years, for another example look at Mugabe's Zimbabwe  and his constant use of the threat of ""western imperialists"" as a way to maintain his grip on power. 

Every murderous regime or wanna-be regime needs a threat to rally their populace and Israel really is one of the best, especially these days since it's ran by neocon nutjobs and is clearly breaking international law. What unites Muslims more than Palestine?

And what? When someone asks who you married you hold a picture of a guy up and say ""This is my wife, Dennis"" with an awkward smile on your face then try to convince everyone that he's actually just a really manly looking woman?

You're legitimately retarded.

&gt;Why are gays not proud to be in civil unions? Because they are deeply ashamed.

Or, radical idea time, they actually just wanted to have exactly the same rights as everyone else. And there's still plenty of gay people who have civil partnerships because, newsflash, there's lots of gay people who don't believe in marriage. Just like there's lots of heterosexual people who have also had civil partnerships. You really are a fucking idiot.

&gt;Gay marriage is a regression. Yet you seem to be celebrating this! How hateful of gays are you?!?

""Liberate the Kurds"" Oh lord the holy Kurdish victims, 2nd option saints trotted out since the WMDs didn't turn up.  Let's establish some facts about global politics when Saddam genocided the Kurds in 1988.  In 1988 the Iran-Iraq war was still happening.  During that war the U.S. and [big supporters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_support_for_Iraq_during_the_Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_war) of Iraq's military efforts.  The U.S. provided Iraq with [satellite intelligence to deploy poison gas on Iranians.](http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/08/25/secret_cia_files_prove_america_helped_saddam_as_he_gassed_iran).  Everyone was bandwagoning with Saddam to contain Iran's revolutionary Islam.  The Kurds were allied with Iran as fifth columnists.  When Saddam was committing his crimes against humanity he had NATO countries selling him the weapons and giving him the intelligence to do it with.  In many cases Saddam was making alliances with the very same people who would turn on him later.  This is in the period when he is committing his worst atrocities!

Hitchens was famously anti-Iranian.  I don't think he was much of a friend of the Kurds until many years later and for very different reasons.  

This whole region is more complex and morally ambiguous than you're giving it credit for being.  The Kurds aren't a mystical oasis of secular rationality in a Jihadist desert, they're armed actors in an anarchic political environment.  They have made as many compromises as anyone over the years.  It's funny, all these supposed ""pro-Kurdish"" opinions, when the US/UK has always stood with Turkey in suppressing the Kurds.  Today you can buy an ISIS t-shirt on the streets of Istanbul and wear it through the city.  Turkish government says it can do nothing and Turkish defenders say that's proof of liberty.

He was worse than the 20 year old playing in his first set of regular minutes for the club. Flanagan performed better, and lets not kid ourselves, Flanagan isn't a top four club fullback yet either, and Johnson wasn't even matching that. 

No, it isn't okay to wish injuries on him or be mean to him, but the man has been a liability. He's come back this season worse somehow. It blows my mind why people make up this ""he's being victimised for all our problems"". 

People were happy he was injured because despite a player being in the squad currently out-performing him, Johnson was starting ahead of Manquillo. 

Glen has been a great servant to the club, and was amazing a few seasons ago, but if he carries on performing at the level he's at, I don't want him in the team ever again. Just because you're fond of a player because of their history doesn't make it wrong to jog them on once they become a liability...that's football. 

Now onto Gerrard. He hasn't been performing adequately and people are asking for him to be dropped to either get some rest and sort his game out, or see if we perform at a better level without him. Nobody is ever happy with Gerrard out, but he's not the player he was in 2009 and it isn't the end of the world if he's not fit. 

He's currently playing in a defensive position, and not defending. If one player man marks him it's pretty much game over, and it's barely an exaggeration. His offensive game gets completely shut down, and because he has defensive issues on top of that, all we do is give up more pressure on the defense.

Times move on and sentimentality doesn't get results. I love Gerrard, like I'd make a fucking shrine to the man, but if he starts become an issue, he should not be above criticism or being dropped. Same with anybody in the squad.

Anyway, if I had more time (or next time I'm in the UK) I'd love to sit in a one pub town type of pub...or like seven of them all over the Kingdom.

All of my best pictures travelling are in front of some natural wonder, but all of my best memories are sitting in a bar somewhere.

The pub by the Museum had a fruit machine, and my dad was taught by another father son pair how to play. He won something like 50 pounds within 5 minutes. The dad was so angry, he'd never won shit. My dad bought him a few beers obviously, but it was hilarious.

I smoked at the time too, and when I lit one up, the son sitting next to us said something like, ""Thank Christ! I heard your American accents and assumed you'd be all pissy about fag smoke."" Then he pulled out his pack and we were all best friends for the next two hours. That's the one thing I miss about smoking as a matter of fact.

The pictures you found are awesome. We went to a pub or two like the first one. I'd never have known if it was a chain, and have no clue where it was, but one looked very similar to that place.

Our gastropubs are modern too but not in the same way. They're almost always decorated with ""reclaimed"" wood, and are often very unpolished in feel. Big hunks of meat and hardwood, rusty metal, geometric concrete shapes and big letters on everything (menus, walls, whatever) are sort of the craze.

And a ""bootlegger"" burger: http://i.imgur.com/emEX3Sj.jpg ...a lot of the theme in these places is supposed to go back to the early 1900's when people were smuggling moonshine in the South. Bootleggers used to distill liquor in their barns...hence all the crappy old barn wood everywhere and Mason jars in every hipster hole around.

So many tropes are taken from British pub culture but nothing of any substance. Things like saying ""cheers!"" but not quite in the right contexts; even the use of the words tavern, public, pub, or house annoys me. They're basically just restaurants with a bigger beer selection, there's really nothing ""public"" about them in my opinion (but here I am asking about pubs). It just seems like all the pub accoutrements but not much pub.

Suarez and Sturridge are masters at this: allow the centre back to get tight, then move out wide, either taking the marker with them or getting space as the centre back transfers him to the left or right back. That space gives players like Henderson, Sterling, and Coutinho great room to combine from midfield.

If Balotelli and Lambert get a bit more mobile, and smarter in dragging defenders with them, we'll be able to play (and complete) many more attacking forward passes at speed. So many of our recent games (Villa especially) we looked congested down the middle, so everything naturally has to slow down or the ball gets intercepted. This is why Coutinho's had such a hard time of it lately -- the channels have become narrower, which means his passes aren't completed as often.

Create space, pick up speed, and play incisive forward passes. That's how Liverpool won games last season, and how they can again.

Yes, I did read the comment. Let's find all of the standard UKIP apologist talking points...

- *""Being anti-immigrant isn't racist""* -- check.

- *""It's not racism, because we hate (some) white immigrants too""* -- check.

- *""UK immigration is currently unsustainable""* -- check.

- *""Immigrants should integrate, multiculturalism is bad""* -- check.

It's amazing how much bullshit you can squeeze into a few short sentences.

UK immigration is *not* unsustainable. In fact, if it weren't for immigrants, our economy would be in serious trouble. British people aren't having enough children, if we want there to be taxpayers to fund the NHS and our pensions once we've retired, then we need immigration.

So, there's no good reason to oppose immigration, except xenophobia. The fact that only certain immigrants attract UKIP's ire is really telling: There are 400,000 French immigrants in the UK, but you never, ever hear UKIP complaining about them.

Multiculturalism is one of the great things about the UK. It's one of the reasons that we are so successful at attracting immigrants. Open-minded people think that it's great that we live in a cultural melting pot. We would feel stifled by a monoculture. We also very much like being able to go and work wherever we like in the EU. That's a precious freedom.

&gt;&gt; some choked-off, ossified little-england.

UKIP hate everything that we've achieved in the last 50 years. Their vision for Britain is to turn the clock back to some imagined halcyon past, and freeze it there. Here's Alex Massie on the subject:

Honestly that middle place next to Capoue is up for grabs, ranging from Stambo to even Mason, no one has really been a stand out candidate for it.  
However Poch will probably pick the same team from last week with maybe only one or two changes.

It couldn't work just as it couldn't fail. All I want is *a* voice even if it's just one party making sure people are being challenged in their views. Nationalism and the sort of personality politics of Nigel Farage rarely lasts that long unless the public are provided with no other alternative. 

If a party existed in the United States to provide decent health care and decent welfare provisions along with political funding reform and other things I know plenty of people would be energised to oppose the status quo - enough people moan about it anyway. As it is most of the country sits around and moans about it but doesn't do anything. To be fair the system is so corrupted over there that it has much less of a chance of working than other places but if the option was there some real change could be had. I want the Lib Dems to stick around to be an alternative and a catalyst for opposition to UKIP's extremism (which itself is starting to disappear on it's own as the party seeks to be more electable). They don't need to win elections or debates to do that though it is nice when they do. I actually thought he destroyed Farage in  the debates they had but then again I find Farage's argument totally insubstantial and his speaking style incredibly irritating so I suppose that was a given.

Does a 10% excess really sound like an addiction to constantly stuffing the face to you?

To me, it sounds like a failure of appetite regulation to compensate for a small but sustained excess. Something well within the range of normal daily variation except that it's not just for a short period.

Here's one for you anyway, since people here are more interested in downvoteing than engaging in discussion. 

/u/daos was obviously making a sarcastic comparison between how people have been reacting to the news of several high profile crimes committed by Muslim's and Pakistani's, and how people do not react in the same way when it is Christians who are the ones who are committing crimes. 

He says that he is being sarcastic, but I believe that he actually thinks that people are being discriminatory by reacting to the crimes that Muslims have committed and not those of Christians. 

The problem with that logic, a problem that the two of you share, is that if you look at the recent high profile crimes committed by predominately Muslim/Pakistani men, the systematic rape of children across several different towns and cities around the UK, including Rotherham. You should be able to see that those crimes are much more serious, organised, damaging, and liable to cause outrage and offence than a few people leafleting a residential home. 

Add to this the fact that it is clear that the cultural upbringing of these men was a contributing factor in why they committed the crimes, and you can see that outrage is understandable when it comes to the Rotherham and other similar cases.

Land taxes are phenomenally hard to implement and what exactly is a ""luxury"" and why should they be put out of reach to those on more modest incomes?

Most bizarre is the focus on poverty vs wealth, framed within the technological age. 

The one thing about the technological age is the guaranteed wealth gap. Technology is global and this gives a handful of people the chance to make ginormous amounts of money.

Poverty is the key issue here - not the wealth gap. And while this theory tries to address it, it seems massively costly with no real benefits for employers, whose taxes are supposed to fund it. If their productivity drops because people are busy working on their rights and deciding whether they want to come to work, then you'll have a smaller pool of profit to tax.

Thing is though, I am feel confident enough in the beliefs which I articulate in public under my own name to have them withstand scrutiny. If I was targeted for punishment by this group, I think the very worst they would do is publicise some of the more fringe but (I think) obviously correct positions I hold. Even my reddit account, which I am careful to keep anonymous, doesn't contain anything I wouldn't be prepared to express in public although I might moderate my language a bit in public, although I would defend the right of people to keep their reddit accounts anonymous if they wish.

I think you're right the key issue here is whether FB constitutes private speech. I don't think it can, otherwise people can speak without social repercussion - (social) repercussion is a crucial check on unfettered free speech; if I say something stupid I should expect to be robustly challenged on that speech by anyone with an interest in the topic (including my employer). If I can 'take back' speech which is inflammatory by claiming it was intended to be private then I am essentially given a license to abuse whoever I want without reply; I am not in favour of this, so I am not in favour of the concept of 'private speech' (except obviously insofar as people shouldn't but my telephone, though they could listen in to my conversation if I had it on a train)

A second issue is whether TFL constitutes 'the government' - I don't think it is right the government punish you for speech no matter how bad that speech (although the law in Britain is that they can), and never for political opinion (which this clearly is, and which the government can punish you for in Britain).

And unlike you, I have looked at the report by the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Exploitation in Rotherham. 

By the standard of that report, literally hundreds of children have been ""systematically raped"" by white men in Lincoln. 

It's funny how you don't want to talk about systematic rape, except when it's caused by people with a different colour of skin from yourself.

If you cared about rape, then that's what you'd be talking about, not about pakistani muslims. You'd be doing so in places like /r/SRSDiscussion, where they actually care about this stuff, and where they're actually informed.

Instead, you choose to ignore rape by white men, so you can make cheap and ignorant political points about ""those Pakistani immigrants"".

It's quite clear that ""the cultural upbringing"" of men like you ""was a contributing factor in why they committed the crimes"", but you're too lazy, misogynistic and pathetic to get outraged about that, you weaselly whining wanker.

A better approach IMO would be to call it a negative income tax, as people would naturally see how 99% of people actually still earn more than the negative tax component, and most still pay more positive tax despite it.

If you market it as a free cheque in the post for everyone, people will raise questions like ""What do I need this for? I'm a working class hero, etc."". Instead, by making it an income tax component most people will clearly see the simplification of ""giving with one hand [negative income tax], and taking with the other [positive tax]"". Although some at the lower end will be a net receiver of money, they will still feel an involvement in the system that will justify in their head the whole thing. Likewise, someone who's a net contributor today and begrudges ""everyone else"" getting a free ride will see in his monthly pay cheque that his benefit is coming in just the same as everyone else, it's just he also pays more tax.

false,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;You didn't give me an answer, though, did you, mate?

Yes I did. The difference is the severity of the crimes, not sure how I can make it any clearer. 

&gt;And unlike you, I have looked at the report by the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Exploitation in Rotherham.

Me too, the day it came out, as did half the people on this board I'm sure, it was linked in every discussion about the case. 

&gt;By the standard of that report, literally hundreds of children have been ""systematically raped"" by white men in Lincoln.

Yes obviously. As I have had to explain to too many people, Pakistanis make up less than 2% of the population of the UK. Obviously the vast majority of rapes in this country are going to be committed by white men. If the majority were committed by less than 2% of the population we would have an epidemic. 

The issue is whether Pakistani men commit a **disproportionate** number of these crimes. There are less than 3000 Pakistani men living in the Rotherham area. And a very conservative estimate puts the number of victims at 1400. Does that seem disproportionate to you? 

&gt;If you cared about rape, then that's what you'd be talking about, not about pakistani muslims. You'd be doing so in places like /r/SRSDiscussion, where they actually care about this stuff, and where they're actually informed.

So the only people who care about rape are those subscribed to /r/SRSDiscussion ? 

I have gone into detail closer to the time about why these men committed these crimes, and I firmly believe that one of the contributing factors was their cultural upbringing. I'm very well informed, and I don't need your approval. 

&gt;Instead, you choose to ignore rape by white men, so you can make cheap and ignorant political points about ""those Pakistani immigrants"".

Here are my comments on the situation from a previous discussion:

&gt;The question is do Pakistani men commit a disproportional number of these crimes.
The answer is hard for many people to accept, but it does seem to be yes. There are many reasons for this, but in part it is because of Pakistani culture being imported from Pakistan, and then incubated inside of isolated Pakistani communities in the UK which do not integrate, and so pass these cultural ideas along the generations.

&gt;You mention that there is a significant issue with sex abuse by white men, but it is very unlikely that it is wider British culture that is to blame for their actions isn't it? What is it about British culture that encourages that behaviour? There is plenty that discourages that behaviour.

&gt;The likelihood is that there is a more localised reason for the way they act, in the same way that the the reason these Pakistani men acted in the way that they did was localised to their community.

&gt;In almost all cases like this it is the environment that the perpetrator is brought up in, or surrounded by that leads to their actions, either by encouraging it, or doing nothing to discourage it. Whether it be the culture of being a priest within the catholic church, the culture within television in the 70s that said that stars could get away with doing whatever they wanted, or being brought up in a community which has a culture that says that women are the property of men, and should do as they are told.

So to repeat myself again, these men came from a cultural background where it was the norm to treat women as possession that belonged to men, and where children having relationships with older men was accepted.

This is in no way a accusation that all Pakistani men are child abusers. But if you are in a Pakistani community and you said that women should do as they are told by men, you will get a much less hostile response than if you said that in wider society. Similarly, If you said in a Pakistani community that girls should be able to get married and have children at a younger age, you would get a less hostile response than if you said it anywhere else.

This sort of environment makes it easier for a child abuser to get away with what he does.

Again to clarify, there will always be child abusers in every section of society, but different parts of society will be more of a breeding ground for this behaviour than others.




&gt;It's quite clear that ""the cultural upbringing"" of men like you ""was a contributing factor in why they committed the crimes"", but you're too lazy, misogynistic and pathetic to get outraged about that, you weaselly whining wanker.

Run out of sensible arguments so your resorting to name calling?

Here's my reasoning; Kaboul and Demebele IMO are a must. They know the rivalry all too well and will be vital. Maybe Rose can pull off a nice goal like he did before eh? ;) Now Super Jan HAS to start IMO, vital to our back line. If not, I cannot bare myself to start Vlad back there v. Arsenal. Midfield for the most part stays the same. Now, Bobby SHOULD start. I know he played Wednesday but he needs another run out compared to Ade who just doesn't seem ready again.

Hitchens was pro-Kurdish from the start. That was his major reason for supporting the Iraq war. 

&gt; Let's establish some facts about global politics when Saddam genocided the Kurds in 1988. In 1988 the Iran-Iraq war was still happening. During that war the U.S. and big supporters[1] of Iraq's military efforts. The U.S. provided Iraq with satellite intelligence to deploy poison gas on Iranians.[2] . Everyone was bandwagoning with Saddam to contain Iran's revolutionary Islam. The Kurds were allied with Iran as fifth columnists. When Saddam was committing his crimes against humanity he had NATO countries selling him the weapons and giving him the intelligence to do it with. In many cases Saddam was making alliances with the very same people who would turn on him later. This is in the period when he is committing his worst atrocities!

How is this related to Hitchens in the slightest? What the USA did to arm Saddam was horribly immoral. That doesn't mean that nobody from the west can ever oppose the gassing of Kurds or Iranians in the future. 

&gt; Hitchens was famously anti-Iranian. I don't think he was much of a friend of the Kurds until many years later and for very different reasons.

Against the Iranian regime, yes. Irrelevant. 


&gt; This whole region is more complex and morally ambiguous than you're giving it credit for being. The Kurds aren't a mystical oasis of secular rationality in a Jihadist desert, they're armed actors in an anarchic political environment. They have made as many compromises as anyone over the years. It's funny, all these supposed ""pro-Kurdish"" opinions, when the US/UK has always stood with Turkey in suppressing the Kurds. Today you can buy an ISIS t-shirt on the streets of Istanbul and wear it through the city. Turkish government says it can do nothing and Turkish defenders say that's proof of liberty. You could not say the same of a PKK shirt.

Totally irrelevant to anything. Not every individual in the west needs to support every action of every ally of the US government. ",0,1411676924,null,0,false,0,cksh8as,t3_2hfgl8,t1_cksh8as,t1_ckscwiu,null,1426824713,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

I tried to get into wearing it, but I kept trying physical sunscreens and they all have a white cast so I shelved the idea. After diving into the world of AHAs and photosensitivity I knew I had to give my skin some kind of protection, and reading around it seemed like sun protection 24/7 was the only option. But, if it really is in the UK, then why is sunscreen a seasonal product in shops? Why isn't anything said about all year protection on the NHS pages?

The more I researched, the more I read the more I realised that no, in the UK wearing sunscreen all year around is not mandatory. It won't do you any harm, if you do though.

We aren't protecting against visible sunlight, we are protecting against UV rays. If in doubt, check the Met Office for your UV ratings. In the months between October and March, not wearing sun protection should be fine. Between April and September, be diligent in wearing it, be extra diligent if you're using products that increase photosensitivity.

Gerrard provides amazing emotional support definitely but is positioning is constantly off and his legs are gone. Watching Stewart Downing breeze past him last week show me that that's a way forth Not sure about Henderson's fitness and while his play is improving half the time he's covering for Gerrard. Coutinho has been poor this season. . Moreno is a formidable full back going forward but like Baines/Coleman that's going to leave pockets of space to attack. Seeing Manquillo hauled off after 25 minutes was amusing if nothing else.

I doubt they'll play the formation they changed to for most of West Ham (3 CBs, Sterling and moreno as wing backs) because that opens them up on the counter. It'll be the 4-3-2-1 or the diamond if Rogers chances it and looses Sturridge - I think he'll keep him on the bench with an eye on the League. A draw wouldn't be the worst result in the world for him - though my head says Liverpool will win it due to the psychological burden on Everton.

Their main threat is Sterling and him running at the Everton defence is scary... Balotelli has been dropping deeper and is a big-game player but IMO doesn't have the workrate of Sturridge. I could see Lallana/Sterling combined dragging people wide and creating space - they have to be cut off from midfield support to isolate their efficiency.


If Naismith is playing he has to drop further back and harrass Gerrard - that's who I'd stick him on. Get under his/Balotelli's skin. No high line.

If you know any of the answers to these questions, that would be amazing, but if not, that's ok!

1. Do you know if they're open to the idea of having an international postgrad student for a placement? I know it'd be a bit more complicated to set things up from 3,700+ miles away (e.g. legal agreements, forms, etc.) so that's a concern of mine (if they're even willing to go through it). Or have you seen any international students while you've been there? 

2. Are there any particular people you can think of that I should contact directly, or should I just try to get a hold of anyone within my department/area of interest? It's been pretty difficult for me to get responses out of people, unfortunately. (Pretty much the only responses I've received from sites in NI are like, ""...did you intend to contact xyz service in Northern Ireland?"" YES I WANT TO GO THERE! Is that so unbelievable? Ha! :) )

&gt;

&gt;When the day's predicted UV Index is at various values, the recommendations for protection are as follows: 

&gt;When interpreting the UV Index and recommendations, be aware that:

&gt;


&gt;* The intensity of UV radiation reaching the surface of the earth depends on the angle of the sun in the sky. Each day, the sun achieves its highest angle (highest intensity, shortest shadows) at solar noon, which rarely corresponds to 12:00 on clocks. This is because of the differences between solar time and local time in a given [time zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone). In general, UV risk is high when the sun is directly enough overhead that people's shadows are shorter than their height. 

&gt;* Likewise, UV intensity can be higher or lower for surfaces at different angles to the horizontal. For example, if people are walking or standing outdoors, UV exposure to the eyes and vertical surfaces of skin, such as the face, can actually be more severe when the sun is lower,  such as the end of a summer's day, or winter afternoons on a ski trail. This is partly a consequence of the fact that the measurement equipment upon which the index is based is a flat horizontal surface.

&gt;* UV intensity can nearly double with reflection from snow  or other bright surfaces like water, sand, or concrete. 

&gt;* The recommendations given are for adults with lightly tan skin. While those with darker skin are more likely to withstand greater sun exposure, extra precautions are needed for children and particularly fair-skinned people and those who have [sun sensitivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosensitivity_in_humans) for medical reasons. 

&gt;* Because of the way the UV Index is calculated, it technically expresses the risk of developing sunburn, which is caused mostly by [UVB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet) radiation. However, [UVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet) radiation also causes damage (skin aging, [melanoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma) ). Under some conditions, including most tanning beds, the UVA level may be disproportionately higher than the UV level described by the UV Index. The use of broad-spectrum (UVA/UVB) sunscreen can help address this concern.

&gt;* Damage from sun exposure is cumulative over one's lifetime (but see Berking 2005 ). Cumulative exposure to the sun causes damage to the [epidermis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin\)) (the skin's outer layer) and the [dermis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis) (the deeper layer where the skin's framework exists). Damage to the dermal layer changes the structural components, leading to wrinkling. [Collagen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen) is damaged and degraded; [elastin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastin) fibers thicken and become more numerous; and [reticulin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticulin) fibers appear throughout the dermis rather than outlining the specific [dermoepidermal junction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermoepidermal_junction).

Under some conditions, including most tanning beds, the UVA level may be disproportionately higher than the UV level described by the UV Index. The use of broad-spectrum (UVA/UVB) sunscreen can help address this concern.

Never in a million years.  Which is ironic as the people who would vote against this will vote for things like Workfare, Work Program and such.  All of which are outsourced to private companies (a4e, etc.) and all of which are run for profit.

You'd think these people would realise that their argument of ""something for nothing"" equally applies to the companies and their employees providing these things.  They aren't doing it for free.

I'm pretty sure that if you did a per head cost breakdown of how much an unemployed person costs the system (on Work Program, another on Workfare and a third breakdown of not on any scheme) it'd turn out that the actual JSA hitting the claimants bank was a negligible part of it.

&gt; If you're on JSA you don't have to pay rent or council tax anyway.

Actually a top up of different amounts depending on age, location and such is often required that's without any 'bedroom tax' being factored in.  So yes, people on JSA can end up paying rent; just not the full amount.

Quick rundown:

Leicester (my hometown woohoo!) - small city (~300,000), not very pretty but has it's moments. Right in the middle of the country with transport links for road and rail and East Mids airport is very close so good for seeing the country. Sizeable student population, and decent bars, clubs, restaurants and shopping. Pretty safe overall as long as you steer clear of the rougher areas though burglars often target students but unfortunately this is standard across the country. The uni is good with nice facilities - the library and Student Union are newly renovated and pretty excellent.

Glasgow - biggest city with half a million people and a big student population. Great nightlife and shopping and pretty cheap relative to the rest of the country. Has a bit of a reputation for crime, particularly in the more dodgy areas. Close to Edinburgh so it's well placed for visits and exploring Scotland generally. 

Coventry - small city and had the shit bombed out of it by the Nazis so it's kind of a concrete monstrosity right now and one of the uglier UK cities. Nightlife and attractions are pretty meh as is the shopping so a lot of people just go to nearby Birmingham which is far nicer and only 30mins away by car or train. Again as long as you avoid the shitter areas crime is no different to any other similar city. Personally I'd rank it dead last.

Hertfordshire - uni is in Hatfield which doesn't have a lot to write home about, it's just a small town. BUT it's only 20mins away from London which means there's plenty to keep you occupied but it also means it's incredibly expensive. Don't really know much about it to be honest.

Limerick - ask in /r/ireland

You may be better off asking in the specific regional subreddits (/r/glasgow, /r/ireland, /r/leicester /r/hertfordshire, /r/coventry) as there should be plenty of students in each sub, maybe even some international ones.

Let's contrast two groups: Fundamentalist Muslims and British far-right  extremists.

Both groups contain people born and raised in Britain. Both groups incite violence and division. Both groups use fair means and foul means to pursue their agenda. Both groups use fear and intimidation to control their members. Both groups espouse values that disgust, horrify and offend most of the population. 

But when it comes to the far-right, no one says: ""Well, fuck it. If they don't like living in Britain, why don't they fuck off to Poland or Serbia or Russia."" Because it's understood that these people are British and it's their right to be here, and that it's their society too, even if we think they are pricks. And I think underlying that is the assumption that certain kinds of people aren't really British; that even if they are born and raised in Britain and their parents were born and raised in Britain, they don't really have the same rights as white people - that they are guests, who should abide by the social rules of the majority or fuck off to their ""real"" home.

And believe me, it's tempting to feel like that.

false,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;Your culture puts rapists on TV, where they can sexually assault teenage girls live on air, and gives them knighthoods.

You are close to making a good point, but it is not British culture as a whole that is responsible.  

It was the **culture** of television production in the 70's and 80's that said that the stars were untouchable by the police and could do whatever they want. This lead to the creation of an **environment** where these men could prey on young girls without any consequences. 

It was the **culture** of the priesthood in the 70s and 80s that said that having sex with a young boy was ok, and didn't break your vows, which lead to an **environment** where such things happened regularly. 

So following that logic, it is the **culture** that exists within these small isolated Pakistani communities, where ideas about how women are inferior to men, should do as they are told, and that girls as young as 10 can get married to older men, are carried over from immigrants from Pakistan. The isolated nature of these communities means that these ideas are passed on through the generations, and this creates an **environment** where young men are more likely to develop a feeling of superiority over women, and perhaps more likely to develop sexual urges towards children. Those that do develop those urges will find it much easier to act on them, as it is less of a taboo within their community. 

Please notice I have said Pakistani, not Muslim, because while their religion may have played a part, it is not a defining factor in why they acted in the way they did.

I am also not saying that all Pakistani men will rape, or even all of the men within these communities, but that the **culture** and **environment** of these communities makes it easier for men to develop and act on sexual attraction towards children.

false,dfmacca,cnty-scotland,Edinburgh,"I actually can't remember what I got in high school except for an A at advanced higher art and a C at advanced higher English. The rest of my grades were highers with As and Bs. I just graduated this summer with a first in graphic design, and I'm considering trying to do a masters at RCA or Camberwell etc. Your portfolio will be far more important in most cases. I only did advanced high art so I could spend a year making a portfolio to apply for universities with.


I would highly recommend studying rather than doing things on your own straight from the get go. University gives you two things: *the time to try new things, and without being scared of failing at them*. At university I had the time to try video editing, illustration, editorial work... a whole swathe of things I could never have found the time to do if I was always worrying about getting the next pay cheque in.


Also for graphic design or any design course I would recommend going to an art school or an art school which is a faculty of a larger institution (like mine was) rather than just a one-off course at an ordinary university. Of course this is my own bias, but I find art schools always have a greater sense of community than other faculties and just being in that kind of environment was amazing. During my time I made good friends with painters, printmakers, fashion designers and seeing how other people work in different practices is so informative for your own work. Being with a group of people who do things you're interested in and are interested in what you're doing is the best working environment you could have.


Finally if you ever get a chance, study abroad. I went on Erasmus in France for a semester, and it is the only time I've felt a positive change in myself. Again, it's one of the best ways to live abroad for awhile that becomes harder once you've graduated, and you don't need to worry so much about whether or not you'll make friends and so on because there's a lot of people in the same boat as you.",0,1411684798,null,0,false,0,cksl3nc,t3_2hf0d7,t1_cksl3nc,t3_2hf0d7,null,1426822730,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Non-American or American supporters who have doubts voiced them, 

then the backlash happened and they are all downvoted and the top comments are about hating on American players.

As an American fan, I am super excited his rights are owned by Spurs and really hope he develops, but truth be told, he is coming into one of the strongest spots on the squad (in terms of incumbent starter) that is also a young spot (Walker is 24). This means he is gonna be stuck behind Walker as long as Walker is at Spurs. This changes if a) Walker becomes King 2.0 and is only available for like 20 matches a year due to injury or b) walker stays healthy, plays amazing, then gets sold. 

Another factor generally working against Yedlin is that he is, in terms of a high level European prospect, Old. yea he only turned 21 in July, but most decent European players are going to be playing first team at either a top second tier or lower level top tier club by then (for reference, Danny Rose, who no one thinks is a world beater, but still quality, was playing for Bristol city by the time he was 20 and Sunderland when he was 22).  Now obviously Yedlin can buck this rule, but let's be realistic.

My opinion, Yedlin is a clear purchase by the club to continue to grow the USA fanbase (three tours since we made the champions league, billboard in NYC, selling players like Dempsey and Defoe and Keane before them to MLS. Business wise, there is almost no way this is a downside deal since he was purchased for so cheap and can be sold on. However, I don't see him playing any role bigger than Kyle Naughton does (Cups and spelling injuries). His ceiling is Rose I think, which is phenomenal for an American, but borderline good enough if Spurs really want to challenge and get top 4 every year.

A reduction of £330 a month for each new baby? That's unfair on the child, as he or she should have an equal right to the benefits of that cash.  

What about the state automatically putting the money away into a fund to be given to the child when he or she reaches 18? Then parents would find themselves in poverty after having just one child, without the extra payment to help them cope with bringing up a new life.  

I believe there are solutions to this, but not easy ones.  

I don't believe hyperinflation would play a role here, as taxation and reduced spending on the welfare system (almost all benefits would be replaced by BI) and other related bureaucracy (esp. if it comes with a simpler, reformed tax system) would offset much of the potential for inflation.

This just isn't true. All shares have some volatility: risk and reward go hand in hand. 
But if your hand-picked shares are fluctuating *wildly* then it suggests you're investing in micro or small caps.

Firstly, I promised to update you on the Naked3 [dupe](http://www.makeuprevolutionstore.com/index.php/palettes/redemption-palette-iconic-3.html). I was pretty disappointed when I opened the palette and thought the colours were a bit 'meh', but oh my god, they look so lush on. I haven't been able to find my eye primer all week but they've stayed like a motherfucker. Much, much love. That said, I've only tried two shades so far. I had quite a bit of heavy fallout from one, but as I've only used it once, I'm unsure if that was me being a dunce, or a result of that particular shade, as the second one was fine. The palette really suits blue eyes.

Today I bought their [32 palette do-dah](http://www.makeuprevolutionstore.com/index.php/eyes/palettes/ultra-32-shade-eyeshadow-palette-flawless.html?___SID=U). 

Oh Bethany. It's soooooo pretty. It's in a really heavy gold case and the colours are amazing. I was tempted to buy the one with the more quirky colours too, but I'm not sure they would suit me. 

I am completely enamoured with Makeup Revolution.

You proved yourself an idiot, and that you know nothing about the subject you presume to discuss, as soon as you suggested that 1½ victims a week was some kind of freakishly high number, in a city the size of Rotherham.

Brighton, Plymouth, Hull and Preston all have comparable sizes of population to Rotherham, and it's not credible to imagine that they bask in an incomparably lower crime rate for this particular subcategory of offence. They might have half the rate, or a quarter, but their figures will not be the order of magnitude lower that would be required to make Rotherham's figures truly shocking.

It's also idiotic to take these figures, which refer only to an obscure subcategory of exploitation (previously known as ""teenage prostitution""), outside the larger context.

In any of these cities, ten times the number of women will experience rape or serious sexual assault, but they'll be adults, and their rapists more than likely white, so you don't care about them.

If anything, Rotherham's figures for this crime are high because perpetrators have been allowed to get away with it for so long, but the victims there were vulnerable, and many of them were let down by the system before their groomers even met them.

You absolutely do have a nasty prejudice, that you're obsessing about that one case, when you care nothing about these kinds of issues at any other time.
