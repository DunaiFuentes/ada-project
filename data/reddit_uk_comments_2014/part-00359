It's taken her years to come to the point of accepting her illness and accepting the help she requires and taking her mess. But last year she was going through a bad episode and decided to ring an ambulance for herself. She ended up in a&amp;e and then was released the next day when they said there were no free beds in mental health hospitals for her to go to.

Now she's had a history in the past of sometimes being violent when she is bad. It took her a lot of courage to admit herself to hospital and I just find it horrific how in cases like this when people are trying to go to hospital themselves they are being turned down.

false,chippeh,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"ahh, my apologies for the confusion. by ""them"" I refer to British soldiers. Let me further explain:

""Theirs not to reason why"" comes from from a famous poem called the Charge of the Light Brigade https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Charge_of_the_Light_Brigade_%28poem%29

The whole verse:

    Someone had blunder'd: 
    Theirs not to make reply,
    Theirs not to reason why,
    Theirs but to do and die:

The general interpretation of this means that a bad mistake was made, and the soldiers who died in that ill fated charge (and in all wars) can not ask why they are fighting. Their job has no allowances for them to to ask why they fight, their job is to do and die. 

Thus, I support those who ""do and die"" - but I do not in most cases support those who choose to send those to ""do and die"". So I wear a poppy to support veterans, but I question the reason why.

There was one episode where he started off slow then threw in something random like he does, like how Paul Whitehouse took the piss on that sketch; 'is it a dolphin in a bathtub?' And the audience erupted in laughter, but he just looked unhappy. Next question, same again, and the next. And he just had this wierd expression on his face.

Then he started breaking the fourth wall. 'I just said something random and they laughed' &lt;Audience laughs&gt; They did it again &lt;Audience laughs&gt; I can say anything it doesnt matter they just laugh &lt;Audience laughs&gt; 

It was a wierd moment to watch, possibly all a gag but it looked like he was seriously questioning 'what the fuck am I doing with my life?' I think he went off for a series not long after too. Now he says the show got better after his break but I dont know you rewatch early series and he did appear to be having more fun. And its only after that happened we saw the episodes where it crossed over into vicious territory, like when he took his feud with Deayton to air and ended up getting him sacked. Or the one where Bruce Forsyth hosted and him and Linda Smith just tore him to shreds the whole episode. Now I hate Bruce Forsyth and actively avoid watching him dodder his way through every crap joke but I felt genuinely sorry for him watching that, it just got cruel. 

So yeah I reckon he had a moment and he just hasnt been the same since, he has days that are OK but most episodes he just looks like he's phoning it in and the guest comedian provides the humour. Which is sometimes funny in itself because he'll sometimes seem to get jealous at the other guy getting the laughs and do anything to steal focus, if its shouting over the top of them or remember when Reginald Hunter was on and he threw water in his own face (noticably pissing RGH off when some splashed him).

Firstly the [Edinburgh University Musical Instrument Museum](http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/information-services/library-museum-gallery/museums-and-galleries/musical-instrument-museums). Lots of nice instruments to have a look at there, great place.

A couple of notable places to look for music are the [Usher Hall](http://www.usherhall.co.uk/) and [The Queen's Hall](http://www.thequeenshall.net/). The Usher Hall hosts classical concerts (e.g. Royal Scottish National Orchestra, Scottish Chamber Orchestra) as well as other music events (rock, pop, etc). The Queen's Hall tends to focused more on smaller classical events (chamber music etc) I would say, as they are better suited to that hall as it's much smaller.

You might also be interested in e.g. the [Festival Theatre](http://www.edtheatres.com/festival) as Scottish Opera often perform there.

I'd say it verges on the point of harassment.

The police don't send out letters to everyone reminding them that it's illegal to steal, so an ""OFFICIAL INVESTIGATION"" has been started to see if you've nicked a Fredo from your local corner shop.

I moved into uni halls in September, and after about two months everyone received a letter about them launching an ""OFFICIAL INVESTIGATION"", basically saying you need to pay or declare that you don't need to.

So you fill in the form online, and then you're informed that they may visit your property to check you don't need a TV license. (Which prompted me to pre-emptively remove their implied right of access.)

I don't watch live TV at all, so to have to go through all that is annoying.

You don't need carbs to feel satiated. Fat triggers satiety well enough. Well, [unless you eat it with carbs it would seem](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/095032939090048Y) (""satiating power of dietary fat is least when it is eaten in the context of a high carbohydrate, energy-rich diet"").

In general science seems to agree with you though, that carbs provide better satiety than fat per joule. Then again in eating regimes such as keto you of course also eat *protein*.

The problem with carbs, for me, is that it is like crack to me. I do get sick of eating fatty food eventually and just stop. Whereas with carbs I keep going even if I feel like I'm going to burst. And even then I still have appetite. It's just that I physically can't eat anymore.

This is of course different for me as a formerly severely obese person with a bit of an eating problem, I suppose.

What do you think the Police were like when you grew up? 

I hate to break it to you, but your old memories are nonsense. The police used to do whatever the hell they wanted, used to beat the shit out of folk in the back of the vans, batter the shit out of them in the cells etc. Do you think the ""they fell down the stairs"" trope comes from nowhere? Do you think the racism in the force is a new thing? It's come from generations of it in Policing.

Shocking performance by Azpilicueta. Ivanovic was in blistering form at the beginning of the season, but now that's dissipated. I think now is the right time to make the switch, and return Azpi to RB and let Luis hold down that LB position. We were really missing that involvement from the fullbacks today, to give us some width and crossing ability. If our wingers weren't willing to do that, at least we could have relied on natural fullbacks to do so.

Tough game, Sunderland parked the bus hard. Deserved point from them. I think this game may have been a blessing in disguise, as it may bring us back to earth. Just hoping Southampton can get a draw tomorrow. UP THE CHELS!

Um. To answer seriously I don't really have any idea. I mean, it's my nationality I suppose, more than anything. I have ancestry from each country, and Ireland too, so it's the only thing I can really label myself as.

Like others have said the '100% British' trend, flag flying and 'make britain great again' are all a bit much for me. We don't make or do anything anymore, anyway. Surely it should be a given that the milk sold in supermarkets should be made in Britain, otherwise what are all those cows in the countryside doing? As for anything useful, well that all comes from China, Japan or California... Can't really compete with them either.

I suppose it feels a little like we've been neutered, we don't really have much of a niche. I mean there is the good old financial sector but that's not exactly something you can take any pride in. Doesn't mean anything to me... And yeah, wow, we finally managed to splutter out a new aircraft carrier with no fucking aircraft on it. Not exactly getting my flagpole stiff with that. 

Maybe that's why we do have this obsession with labelling the damn milk as British, as we aren't really *doing* anything. Oh and the farmers milking the cows are getting ripped off anyway, so we won't be able to drink British milk anymore. 

Then we have the trite little obsessions that even we on here go on about all the time (well moreso britishproblems). Ooh I dunked my digestive for too long. Ooh my tea went cold. Ooh I held a door open and they didn't say thank you. Those are what everyone else thinks it means to be British, and they aren't exactly wrong. That kind of thing is probably the most relatably British stuff we do actually get up to these days. I mean it's alright, nothing wrong with it all, but it's hardly very... Hardly very hot-blooded or vigorous is it? I'd rather be like someone from the US who takes pride in freedom/liberty/strength/history and so on, as much as that kind of attitude gets shit on by us.

I suppose as a history student, I relate strongly to our history. But that's a difficult game to pull off these days, as it's not so popular to do so anymore. We're even divorcing the only thing that anybody might be able to take pride in, right or wrong. Can't say anything good about the empire otherwise god knows somebody will start arguing with you. And they aren't wrong, it wasn't all roses, but there's at least pride in it. Some strength, and pride too. 

For me I suppose being British is a lot like being a Liverpool fan, banging on about how great things used to be.",0,1417289231,null,0,false,0,cmgb90a,t3_2nr4ff,t1_cmgb90a,t3_2nr4ff,null,1425767398,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Theory 

I am hoping a 4-1-3-2, give the team license to attack, multiple forwards, and let the defense you know you have faith to hold up against Leichester.  They need to score quickly and destroy any fight the home team has.  I would understand not changing Moreno for Enrique, he did play okay and was a part of the clean sheet.  But I would like to see Moreno back in the XI.  

Game plan

Allow full backs to attack.  CM will have to cover a lot of ground, so will need help from the three attacking midfielders/wingers.  Strikers stay up top, with pressure on the back line when defending looking to cut passes.  Three attacking midfielders look to interchange and create one twos off the back of the strikers.

When you start a job with a company you're handed out a Employee Rights and Responsibilities leaflet/booklet etc.

[I.E. something along the lines here.](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/32184/10-1202-starting-out-your-employment-rights.pdf) 

A quick scroll down to the Discrimination section quite clearly lists two main points:

----
At work, unlawful discrimination
is when someone is treated worse
than others for a reason that has got
nothing to do with the job.
Reasons why you can’t be
discriminated against include:

gender or gender reassignment

sexual orientation

marriage or civil partnership

disability

race

colour

ethnic background

nationality

**religion or belief**

age 

----

Indirect discrimination is when a
working condition or rule puts one group of
people at a disadvantage for one or more
of these reasons. **Shop assistants**, who
wear turbans for **religious reasons**, **lose
their job because the company’s dress**
**code** doesn’t allow hats or headscarves.
That’s **indirect discrimination on the basis
of religion or belief**. 

---

Now let's go back to OP's situation here, they're Jewish and do not wish to work in the meat section due to possibly having to handle pork.

You claim that they can handle pork, but that's just not true, it explicitly states in two separate passages in the bible that Jews are unable to do so:

And the pig, because it has a cloven hoof that is completely split, but will not regurgitate its cud; it is unclean for you. You shall not eat of their flesh, and **you shall not touch their carcasses**; they are unclean for you.

—Leviticus 11:7-8
And the pig, because it has a split hoof, but does not chew the cud; it is unclean for you. You shall neither eat of their flesh **nor touch their carcass.**

—Deuteronomy 14:8


Now let's go back to the indirect discrimination example and apply OP's situation:

Indirect discrimination is when a working condition or rule puts one group of people at a disadvantage for one or more of these reasons. **Shop assistants, that refuse to handle pork, lose their job because the company’s scheduling forces them to break their religious code.** **That’s indirect discrimination on the basis of religion or belief.**

Going back to a league where its Rangers V Celtic competing for the title whilst the rest fight over the scraps that fall off the table is going to help no one.

I think the league needs to be ran as a complete product rather than for individual clubs.  There needs to be a challenge at the top and one of the best ways to do that is to give more money to the other clubs in the league.  Instead of Old Firm Fans saying why should they give Ross County or St Johnston their money weakening their team,  they should look at it being more competition for the team, making them more competitive in the long run and increasing interest in the league.

The 20 teams would play two single round-robin tournaments each year.  An opening league and the closing league.  2 Champions would be awarded and European positions would be given by having playoffs between the clubs per each season.

Ultimately you have to choose - either let people who can't afford the licence get access to the BBC for free as well, or decide that people who *can't* afford the licence fee also aren't allowed to watch ITV or other paid channels.

The first option basically means that *nobody* bothers paying for a licence if they can possibly get away with it, so the BBC doesn't even exist in its present form (with all the negative consequences that implies), and people who do pay feel hard done by that other people are getting entertainment (a *luxury*, don't forget) for free that they're forced to pay for.

The second option is ""unfair"" in the other direction, but all it means is that poor people can't get access to a luxury service that otherwise *economically* they could be given access to.  A luxury service, remember, that is a *luxury* - nothing they have any inherent right to demand or expect.

The UK government has already demonstrated that it doesn't give a shit for the south west, especially the further west you go.

Look at transport - Cornwall and Devon have shit roads and a shit rail line with no sign of improvement (Exeter is where civilisation ends as it has the airport, motorway and two lines to London, one of which is quite fast). Even Bristol is only finally getting electric trains decades after the north got them.

What's sad is that Cornwall's funding is based on a programme that is aimed at getting eastern Europe up to speed - and it's the only place in England to qualify (alongside some part of Wales). So it makes me laugh when northerners go on about how they're so hard done by and assume ""the south"" is just full of people in 2014 plate Range Rovers with wheelbarrows of money in the back - especially if they're not from Newcastle and the North East, which is probably about the closest to us economically.

I'd love to see a regional assembly for this reason. I think a Bristol/Exeter based assembly would probably care about us far more than Westminster, whose priorities seem to lie around a diagonal line that connects London and Manchester.

Our voting history doesn't help either. The Conservatives know that they do well here and there's plenty of pensioners who will be happy with their solid gold pensions, so they don't do anything, and Labour won't do anything because they will always do poorly so there's no votes to buy like there are up north",0,1417292116,null,0,1417292530,0,cmgck5x,t3_2nrbuk,t1_cmgck5x,t1_cmg6g1d,null,1425766776,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Let's be serious.  The positives were that BR benched Gerrard and played Lucas, same with Lovren and Kolo. This, combined with his interview makes me hope we'll start using Gerrard as an impact sub in an attacking role. Also Enrique and Johnson played well. When I saw them start I was disappointed but they both played well. 

However I think until Adam came on we lacked the creativity to break through the defense. The fact we stuck with the 4-5-1 is frustrating as fuck. Yes Lambert played well but until the second half and introduction of Adam we had no shots. I honestly think had Hughes not brought Adam on it would have been a draw or loss. 

That said I think BR is the man for us. He showed last season that he is tactically flexible, think of all the formations we tried from 3-5-2 to 4-3-3 infill we settled on the diamond. His transfers have been poor but hopefully that can be fixed. I'm not sure why he's so stubborn this time round and also why he's abandoned some of his buys like Borini.

false,Captain_Reid,,Lisburn,"Compared to the Belfast that my parent's grew up in Northern Ireland is a much safer place. Nothing much happens now a days, sure we have 'security threats' every now and again.

We don't have a functioning government, and hate crimes against non-English speaking residents in very specific areas of Belfast are becoming a bit common; but no more so than any other area of western Europe.

Certain areas of Belfast aren't great and you should probably avoid, but that's the same as any city. 

The south of the city (where Queen's is and the majority of students live) is safe and a nice place to live. 

Cost of living is great here, quality of life is great too.

Queen's in particular is a fantastic university, with a great reputation across the world, fantastic facilities, a fantastic community and excellent teaching. Stranmillis and St Mary's are 'colleges' of Queen's (Note that these are different from american colleges; they're 'sub-universities' of Queen's). Stran. and St Mary's tend to be mainly focussed around teaching but they do do some other courses.

University of Ulster has a series of campus' spread across Northern Ireland: they have Jordanstown (just outside Belfast), Belfast (Currently only the art faculty is based there, however in the coming years all the faculties located at Jordanstown are going to be moving to this campus as they build new buildings), Coleraine (North Coast of Northern Ireland) and Magee (Just outside Londonderry in North East NI). I'm not that knowledgeable about UU, I know that there computing and engineering faculties are based at Jordanstown for now.

Belfast Metropolitan College is a combination of a former 'technical college' and several 'further education institutes', they do a wide variety of courses, most of which are non-academic and all of which aren't 'degree level'. They do Foundation Degrees accredited by University of Ulster and Queen's (varies by course which one), and BTEC Level 5's (UK nationally accredited qualification) which can be a 'foundation' for entry into university in a corresponding course.

**TL;DR: Queen's (QUB) is the more internationally recognized university and tends to have much better facilities. University of Ulster (UU) tends to have a more 'practical approach' than QUB. Stranmillis and St Mary's are 'colleges' (In the UK further education system sense of the word) and Belfast Metropolitan College (Belfast Met) isn't a University but can lead you to university.

Does your GP know about the side-effects? Have you done your own research into whether the medication may be to blame for the side-effects, and whether alternative drugs are available?

It's not necessarily in your head, but you GP may be reluctant to accept otherwise. Here's a story:

I was laid low for 3 years, taking Simvastatin for high cholesterol. I spent every day of my life with no energy, massive, chronic joint pain and would look at octogenarians with envy, as they had more mobility and a better quality of life than I did. I didn't susepect it might have been the statins that were causing me the misery until I hit google and did my own research.

When I told my GP, they switched me onto Atorvastatin, which promptly doubled the negative side-effects. 

I made the decision to stop taking them and never take them again. My GP has to respect my wishes, although she still would prefer me to be taking them and *deal with* the side-effects of feeling like a 90-year-old - I'm 41.

Do your own research, come to your own conclusions, have a look for hypo/er-thyroid forums and subreddits and get the opinions of people who've been in your shoes already, of whom there's probably many thousands.

Go to your GP ready to discuss alternative medication, the side effects your experiencing, the suggestion that it's the drugs that're causing your misery and be open to what they suggest. Remember alternative drug names and look them up for yourself later. Your GP only sees you in five, ten minute bursts and rely on you explaining what's going on thoroughly and succinctly.

When in fact capitalism can function without democracy, and in fact can function better, see china, bismarkian germany etc. Also the struggle over state power between the classes in a democracy is favoured by those with the resources and cultural hegemony, this is how the number disparity is neutralised. there are alot of over factors at play however as we saw when state power was captured by the unions and nationalisation happened. Think of the obvious class nature and dominace of americas political system. the amount of money spent is vast.

Sure, but not by them.  The drinks in First Class have already been paid-for... but we don't give them to the passengers in Economy.

I really don't see why anyone's entitled to it merely because it doesn't *directly* cost anything to provide it to them... and - with respect - I don't feel like you've really made the case yet so much as just blithely assumed they are so entitled.

&gt; I don't agree that TV is a luxury, not for people who are house-bound (the disabled, the elderly)... That isn't a luxury, it's a lifeline.

See, *that's* a more powerful argument.

Of course blind people and people in residential care already do get cheap TV licences already (for down to as little as [£24 per year](http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/check-if-you-need-one/for-your-home/blindseverely-sight-impaired-aud5)), and over-75s already get them [completely free](https://www.gov.uk/free-discount-tv-licence).

So what you're really arguing for now is not abolishing the TV licence for poor people if they agree to only watch non-BBC channels - it's to minimally expand the rules on who gets a free/reduced-rate TV licence to also include the minority of ""disabled, housebound but not actually in residential care"" people in the country.

That's not a particularly contentious position, and it's certainly not one I even disagree with.  It is, however, a fundamentally different argument to the one we were having about ""*anyone in the country* too poor to afford a TV licence but who can still afford a TV still being allowed to watch ITV/Channel 4/Channel 5"".",0,1417295309,null,0,1417295590,0,cmge07m,t3_2nqwil,t1_cmge07m,t1_cmgdezm,null,1425766101,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

the main point I was arguing against was the idea that anyone who can't afford £2.80 a week should sell their telly.  I am fortunate enough that £2.80 a week is not something I would have a problem paying. But there are a lot of people for whom that is a lot of money, way more than they can afford. So they should just sell their TVs because it's a ""luxury""?   Having a TV is a fairly cheap hobby/time suck...  The licence fee is from a previous age, I don't understand why you need to pay it to watch *any*  broadcast TV, it makes categorically no sense to me and I find it disgusting that people can be criminalised for not paying it.

Puerile or not, I find it an interesting journal of the TVL authority's process(es).

&gt;it's so easy to get them off your back

To me, there seems to be an element of risk even if you follow [the process they put forward](http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/check-if-you-need-one/topics/how-to-tell-us-you-dont-watch-tv-top12) to declare yourself exempt:

From the TVL ""How to tell us you don't watch TV"" page
&gt;Once you are sure you will not watch or record television programmes as they’re being shown on TV, using any device, then please let us know..

This seems to be saying that I simply have to declare that I am sure I will not watch or record television programmes as they’re being shown on TV, using any device.

&gt;As it is our duty to ensure that everyone in the UK who needs a licence has one, we may visit your address to check that no licence is required.

Does this mean they visit my home to ensure that I am sure I will not watch or record television programmes as they’re being shown on TV, using any device?

&gt;If we find during the visit that you do in fact need a licence...

In other words ""If we find during the visit that you are in fact not sure that you do not need a licence...""

&gt;when we make contact on these visits, almost one in five people are found to need a TV Licence... ...you'll need to pay the full licence fee, and you could risk prosecution and a fine of up to £1,000.

Like the letters they send out, it uses vague statements seemingly intended to ensure that I shouldn't risk not paying.

I think you're missing the point of the BBC - the *reason* it's unique amongst UK channels and a world-class media organisation is precisely because ""the unique way it's funded by you, the taxpayer"" insulates it from naked commercial pressures that force other channels to prioritise (or *exclusively* serve) cheap, lowbrow, non-educational, second-hand and/or lowest-common-denominator content instead of original quality programming.

The great thing about the BBC is that it can take chances, make documentaries, serve minority and niche interests and audiences and generally have less pressure to be populist, chase ratings or pander to commercial advertisers.

The question is not whether someone should have to pay for a commercial service they don't want.  The question is whether it's worth denying people access to commercial programming they *could* access for free (but have no inherent moral entitlement to), in order to *ensure the continued existence of a non-commercial media organisation* that turns out quality programming, avoids commercial sources of bias and serves unprofitable minority niches ignored by its commercial competitors.",0,1417296753,null,0,1417297104,0,cmgemzp,t3_2nqwil,t1_cmgemzp,t1_cmge8wt,null,1425765806,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

you then each are told to get on your marks with the chosen vehicles (usually from the main entrance) and told to do 3 laps around the store and you can use whatever weapons you can find to knock each other off or slow each other down, personally i used the Thunderbirds tracy island to knock some lass of her electronic scooter.

false,Shaper_pmp,null,null,"&gt; you keep making some point about free drinks in first class, but I don't see how that's relevant 

Fair enough - I was trying to use an analogy to get across the point ""merely because it's free, that doesn't mean you're therefore inherently morally entitled to it""... but I can see it wasn't really working.

How about if I just point out that even though - say - *a picture of your genitals* might cost you nothing to produce and entertain me, that doesn't mean I have an inherent moral right to demand you send me one? ;-p

^\(But ^seriously, ^please ^don't ^send ^me ^a ^picture ^of ^your ^genitals ^;-)

&gt; So they should just sell their TVs because it's a ""luxury""?

I'm not sure I agree with that claim either, but it's perfectly possible to watch videos, DVDs or the like without needing a licence fee.  The licence fee is for *receiving broadcast TV* not ""owning a TV"" or ""watching anything on a TV at all"", regardless of what the third-party asshats who operate the TV licensing company might unofficially advise people.

&gt; The licence fee is from a previous age, I don't understand why you need to pay it to watch any broadcast TV

There's your first mistake, then!

The licence fee exists in order to support the BBC, to ensure the existence of a well-funded and above all *non-commercial* mainstream media organisation, who are charged with a special mandate from the government to:

* make original, high-quality and educational content
* serve the public interest
* cover unprofitable minority and other niche interests and audiences

... and *not* merely chase ratings, pander to advertisers and dive straight for the lowest common denominator content, as commercial channels and organisations are inherently predisposed (arguably even *required*) to do.

It's not ""a relic of a bygone age"" in the slightest - it's an institutional social protection in favour of the public interest, and serving as a bulwark against the otherwise omnipresence of crass and lowest-common-denominator commercial interest infecting every corner of our media and reducing it to nothing but Fox News, X-Factor and Big Brother.

As I've said elsewhere in this page, aside from vastly larger budgets (a consequence of the fact they have massive scope for lucrative domestic and worldwide syndication that the UK TV industry can't match), look at the frankly *abysmal* quality of much American TV:

* rampant and unchecked bias and inaccuracy in the news media
* lowest common denominator content
* omnipresent advertising crowding out even actual entertainment content (seriously - it's not unusual to have an advert break followed by the show's credits, followed by another advertising break!)
* lack of factual or educational programming, to the point *even supposedly factual channels* like the History Channel end up showing reality shows like Duck Dynasty and bullshit ""documentaries"" like UFO Hunters and [Ancient Aliens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Aliens) (famously featuring [this dipshit](http://www.davidduke.com/images/Alien-Guy.jpg)).

The different funding mechanism removes many of the commercial pressures, compromises and sources of pressure the other channels operate under, and allows the BBC to operate *in the interests of the public*, rather than in the interests of its shareholders or advertisers.

The point is to ensure the British media contains and is influenced by a world-class media organisation, suffering fewer of the economic and agenda-driven pressures that commercial competitors are forced to compromise with, and thereby not only churning out quality original programming itself and representing the best of Britain abroad, but also keeping the other UK media organisations honest and to a higher standard by comparison.",0,1417298202,null,0,1417299204,0,cmgfa15,t3_2nqwil,t1_cmgfa15,t1_cmgeamo,null,1425765508,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I grew up on the coast, not too far north of Aberystwyth, and am practically fluent in Welsh (all be it, very rusty). My parents don't speak a word of Welsh yet I was forced into Welsh first language classes throughout high school. On requesting to change to second language (because I'm the oldest sibling, therefore have no assistance at home), I was told that I had to remain in first language because they had to keep numbers up. 

I left school with a D in my First Language Welsh GCSE. Second language classes left with a As level in second language Welsh... I was pretty livid.

I worked from 14-24 in pubs, behind the bar and as a waiter, before moving and only spoke Welsh when someone from England asked to hear the language and to eves drop on the very few people who actually use it. Now I'm out the country, I never use it (except to insult friends).

I understand why people adore the language, it's a very cultural thing, but I refuse to force my daughter to learn a language she'll never use instead of a language she could easily use (French or German) at work in the future.

When you consider that only 19% of the population of Wales speak any Welsh at all, you can see why. There aren't any figures for first/second language speakers that I've been able to find, but there are plenty of first language families, especially in North Wales, whose choice language is Welsh, but they're equally proficient in English. 

There is indeed an area of the Argentine Patagonia that speak Patagonian Welsh. People migrated there in the 1860's in hopes of protecting Welsh culture and language, as they feared it was threatened in Wales. It's not worked though, the language is declining in use over there too. 

As for accents, It's as varied as it is with English accents in England. There seems to be 4 types of accent:

1. North Walian
2. South Walian
3. A Welsh twang

A North Walian accent sounds a [bit like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uW0IPo6RWg)

One of the best examples of a South Walian accent is [Rhod Gilbert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOGxHVVFP-M) ([or this lass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1RELyM1NhM)), a comedian from Carmarthen. 

I'm of the 3rd category. I lived in a very tourist-centric area of Wales (from birth to 22 years old), as well as in an English family, so I sound like I'm from the midlands more than Wales. When I'm talking normally, a few words will come out with a North Walian accent, but the majority of what I say doesn't. I sound like a cockney when I'm pissed off, which I got from my mother... So I'm some sort of strange hybrid, but it's a similar story for most English speaking families from Mid-Wales.

The important bit that people seem to forget it that if you want to trade with the EU tarrifs free etc you need to obey their rules, which means that UK would still be 'ruled from Brussels' except now it has no say whatsoever.

I accept that, but even fantasy has a plausibility factor and internal logic. If the action breaks the suspension of disbelief for a significant percentage of the audience it's gone too far. I'd argue Doctor Who is guilty of this very often these days, especially in the season finales. People are more science-savvy than ever and some stuff that might have seemed plausible fantasy in the 1960s is now just absurd.

It's frustrating because they could often make minor changes and the plots would be fine. Moon could have been fine if they'd landed on an asteroid that had been caught in Earth's gravity (a second moon) and if the ""single-celled organisms"" were blobs instead of spiders.

I don't agree with the rest of your assessment, though.  Having our post-EL matches at home has not helped us, because if anything, we've played better away from home this season.

As for the teams we and they have struggled against ... Yes, Everton lost to United.  They also lost at home to Crystal Palace.  Furthermore, United has only really started to get their shit together in the past few weeks.  To call United ""resurgent"" on the 5th of October is a bit strong, and the fact that the Toffees could only manage one goal against that United back line is poor indeed.

As for our losses ... the Newcastle match happened very much *after* they had improved: they were in the midst of a six-gam win streak, coming off a draw away at Swansea (who were just beginning to come down off their flying start) and a win over Leicester, and they went on to beat City at the Etihad, Liverpool at home, as well as WBA and QPR before finally losing again at West Ham.  Likewise, in our loss to Liverpool we went up against a Reds team that played its best match of the season against us (I'm not necessarily saying that's a coincidence, mind you). 

We can only play the matches we're scheduled to play, and given our struggles at home, I don't think our schedule has been any more favourable than Everton's.  And the results have been very comparable.

The same with the BBC - even if you don't watch TV or listen to radio, it is a cultural good which enriches the lives of many people and therefore elevates the culture of our nation. Just because you don't use the BBC doesn't mean that the person who you might be debating politics with in the pub doesn't find it a fantastic resource for news and information - or would you rather he pay a subscription in order to be educated about the world around him via his medium of choice? Or would you rather inflict him with yet more adverts (as if we don't get told to BUY BUY BUY enough already in our lives everywhere we go)?

The idea of only paying for what you use directly is to forget how different our country would be without a neutral  broadcaster, unaffected by ads. A pluralistic, mixed media system helps to put pressure on commercial broadcasters to improve themselves to match the quality of the publicly-funded broadcaster. That and the BBC pushes billions of pounds into Britain's private media production economy. 

Sure, ITV is a public broadcaster which doesn't take from the viewers... but I genuinely cannot think of a programme which I saw on ITV which made me feel enriched. There might be some, but I can't name them off the top of my head, unlike with the BBC. What was the last wildlife documentary you enjoyed from ITV? 

Also, looking at the crumbling public media systems across Europe, I think that naive Britons who don't see the benefit of the BBC in comparison with the TV and radio wasteland across the continent will be shooting themselves in the foot if they decided to get rid of the BBC. In Germany, the public broadcasters receive almost double the money, PLUS they have some advertising and the quality is terrible (quantifiably terrible when looking at the statistics of how many would be prepared to actually pay the licence fee if it weren't compulsory).

false,layendecker,crest-new,OLD CREST 4EVA,"I said it at during the late run of the league last season, and I will say it again... This is what supporting a club like Everton is about. 

You get so many pragmatists who will say that the Europa is a poison chalice, and you know what.. They might be right, but drinking out of it tastes fucking great. We are not a club with a top 4 budget, but we have a working class fanbase who deserve these amazing moments because of the amazing support they give week in week out. 

Anyone who said 'I hope we either get Champions League or nothing' can leave their fucking shirt at the door... It is plastic bastards like that, that are ruining the game and turning it from a sport of heart to a sport of money. I would like to think we are above that bullshit, but from the comments I heard from fans 8 months ago- I know we are not. 

The Champions League may bring in huge revenue, and the Europa might tire the players out- but why the hell would we want to grind top 6  if there is a change of beating Wolfsburg in Germany, even if it costs us that position next year.

There are kids whose dads will have taken them to that game, and I guarantee they will never forget it. Yea, going on the coach to Hull or Chelsea is a fun experience for anyone- but waking up with your old man and going for a bratwurst before hitting the town square for the buildup is something that sticks, and will be a story told when they have kids. 

Call it a small club mentality if you like, but I am proud as hell at what Bobby and the boys achieved last year- and I am not bothered in the slightest that we are playing Lille and not Real Madrid, because I know that everyone who went to those away games cheered as loud, and were as proud to be there as anyone in the Champions League.

Besides that, both us and them are going through *massive* transition periods right now. They've bought seven or nine players or some shit like that, and most of them spend their time on the bench.

Dembele (this hurts, because he used to be a favorite of mine) isn't what he once was and I doubt we'll ever see him dominate our midfield again. While his ball control is still really good, I haven't seen him use his pace to break forward like he used to. It feels like he mostly slows down the play now. I'd maybe even sell him this summer.

Lennon is still useful and should even start imo. Lamela and Eriksen both likes to take their time on the ball, Townsend is unfortunatly often very similar. With Lennon we got a player who is quick and plays it simple. This is good in order to compensate so we don't get to static in our attack.

In your otherwise beautiful poem ""The Vision of Sin"" there is a verse which reads – ""Every moment dies a man, Every moment one is born."" It must be manifest that if this were true, the population of the world would be at a standstill. In truth, the rate of birth is slightly in excess of that of death.

I would suggest that in the next edition of your poem you have it read – ""Every moment dies a man, Every moment 1 1/16 is born.""

I've said most the season that playing Sterling alongside either until Sturridge returns would be the best solution as he creates space, drags defenders, gets in the box and has an eye to create chances. Was hoping to see that last night but Sterling ended up playing a wide midfield role in transition and Coutinho instead played off Lambert. Think that was an error IMO.

Moreno is an attacking convert, so naturally he powers forward.

Unfortunately we have neither and even more unfortunately, BR addressed Moreno first in making changes, rather than the last 2 - which I can only deduce is the result of political factors rather than merit (the most powerful authority in the dressing room &amp; the premium CB that BR is shielding away from becoming his gravest managerial error).

At the time when the Holmesdale was rebuilt in the 90's, the away fans used to sit in the whole of the Arthur Wait Stand (now they have a few blocks in it.)
The Holmesdale Block B was the closest these fans could get to the away fans. That's why it was in that location. The reason why they managed to secure a block was probably down to two factors.


1 Shit seats. The actual location and view from Block B is direct under the sky for rainy days. They go from about Row 1 - 20 in that corner. The view is not comparable to about 25 rows back in the middle of the Arthur Wait Stand. Because they are ultimately, shit seats, it leads to the next point 


2 Not sure if they were created in 04-05 (Prem) season or 05-06 (Champ) season, but attendance would be lower in that 05-06 season. I imagine for that first year, fans had tickets somewhere in the holmesdale, saw a few blokes in the corner, thought ""I'll have some of that"" and just sat in the empty seats around them to the point it grew. At the 06-07 season I imagine thats when season tickets were actually bought for the area by these ""wandering"" fans. Once you have the season ticket, you have first picking next season. I suppose it just grew and grew. 


That report was from the Championship days, obviously things have changed. Crowds are obviously bigger now. The Arthur Wait bit at the back do sing pretty much in unison with the fanatics and the notoriety of Palace's support has been good for the club. I would say most people, like yourself, see them as a positive factor, because at the end of the day, they make an atmosphere home or away, win or loss. Arguably 3-0 down to Liverpool with 12mins to go and hearing your fans still fired up and supporting you must do something for the players.


But I do tend to see the same types of comments from people on Twitter who don't like them.


""Someone tell them they're not in Italy/Turkey/Germany etc."" My response to that is, why is that a bad thing? Fans in those countries are notoriously noisy and supportive. 


""Cringy."" That's the convenient, easy, put down that means they don't need to back it up. 


""You fucking need a drum to sing."" No. Plenty of away games we're not allowed it and still outsing any home side. But it does help keep the fans in order when singing the words. 


""Good fans? The 20 kids on benefits, dressed in black in the corner."" Now in the prem its around 150-250. Of varying ages from teens to probably 40's.Yes dressed in black (didn't know you're judged by clothing at football). I personally don't know any one of them but I find it hard to believe with modern football pricing, benefits people could pack out an entire block. Again, its just an irrelevant put down that makes no difference if they were or were not on benefits. 


But when it all comes down to it. They make a great atmosphere and I would rather support a club with ultras / fanatics where other fans come on Reddit and credit our support than support a club like Arsenal where they are frequently mocked by fans for their quiet support.

I think this is the crux of the problem. Racism isn't a simple concept. It's whatever anybody wants it to be.

The more hateful and vocal the activist group (read: blacks, Asians) the more that the definition of racism helps them. The quieter the group (read: Polish, Orientals, Antipodeans) the more abuse they receive.

Don't be weak. Don't be fooled, either. If you let others tell you what ""racism"" is - the more of a retard you are.

Exactly what policies are you talking about anyway? Our policy isn't decided at Westminster. We didn't have our tuition fees tripled, our NHS hasn't been privatised, we haven't had the Tories' welfare cuts (they've had to resort to blackmailing us over it because they can't implement it directly), we don't have shitty pointless elections for Police commissioners, etc., etc.

We don't have enough seats to affect Britain's policy and devolution allows us to set our own, our seats at Westminster are symbolic at best. So having a third of NI return empty seats is entirely appropriate for people who don't think it should be in the UK, and harmless, since nothing is lost.

Anyway, this argument is a bit disingenuous.

You see, what's clear is that whoever is in the next Parliament governing the UK is going to be forced to make MASSIVE MASSIVE cuts.

So you have to ask yourself: How is the UK managing it's money so poorly? 

Secondly the EU has already gone over it's budget too. So again here's a case of spending money on unsustainable ventures/initiatives (in total) and then cutting back.

To look at the difference in fees the UK pays currently 60 million pounds per day to the EU which has increased in over time. What has the EU delivered? The EUROZONE and that has affected the UK economy far more adversely than if we'd kept most of that fee for **political union** and only paid for **single market** access.

It was also super simplified and made to be about the SNP and Alex Salmond - which was totally not the case. There were many voices on many sides of the debate not being heard. It was ""angry nationalists"" versus ""clever sensible folk"".

My understanding is that the BBC intentionally didn't over-report on the issue much before the referendum precisely because they *didn't* want to be seen as having any stance (intentional or otherwise).

We put up with adverts on every other channel. So how about we start putting adverts on the fringe content of the Beeb, the channels and radio stations with the lowest audience, iPlayer could have 30 second ads before each broadcast. 

Offset some of the license fee in the places where people can understand and accept that adverts are a part of modern broadcasting.

Pretty sure that's our last game of the season, so it would already be on my list of potential away days regardless - but yeah, hopefully. Although I'll hopefully be doing so to outsing your lot!

As for the rest of it, I've seen a lot of people who to be honest have no idea what they are talking about hear about your fans and start talking about Turkish fans with knives or nonsense like that - a big issue is that some people just can't seem to separate the term 'ultra' from 'hooligan'. It doesn't help that certain high profile incidents, combined with a few tragedies, have made talking about football atmospheres as a good thing in this country ripe for criticism, and like all things with a tenuous link to a tragedy some people would just shout you down as insensitive rather than talk about it.

For me, in all honesty I watch football more for atmosphere than for actual football - I don't really watch all that much TV football other than Swansea, and obviously I'm heavily invested in seeing us do well but my primary concerns are always more core values (is our ownership the right model, is there a good community spirit in the stands, are we going to have a good sing together) rather than points on the table. It's easy pickings but I'd struggle to tolerate what's gone on in Cardiff in recent years.

Some of the stuff you've said makes me realise it would be difficult to make it happen in Swansea as we don't have the right circumstances - our loudest support is already right by the away fans, which is good, but unfortunately (in regards to this) we sell out every game, so there is no space to set up shop with a small group as you described. It seems to me that you have to start fresh, because while I normally now stand in that above mentioned noisy section, and while it even has a drum and some great songs going on (hymns and arias is a cracker), I'm not going to be able to turn it into an ultra block because it's already too embedded in what it is.

false,WinterSoldier5,null,null,"I wholly agree, we play far too negative as evidenced yesterday. Yes we were playing Arsenal and so it may be fair to play more defensively but we were playing at home, to a weakened Arsenal squad to the point that they were playing a goalkeeper that had never played premier league football before.

Now there may be more factors that i'm not aware of but for me when I see that, i'd want to be a bit more attacking. It annoys me that when discussing the booing of his substitutions he said roughly ""I'm sure fans would love to see me put 8 forwards on but you can't do that you need balance"" Well that's fair enough but balance means a mixture of the two, that works both ways sitting back and defending for 70 odd minutes before deciding to do something is not balance for me.

Going back to the booing of substitutions whilst i'm not a fan of it personally I can see why, Irvine seems to have a set script that we stick to week after week. It's the same starting 11 every week regardless of the last weeks results and even then we seem to make the same substitutions every time, first is Anichebe on Sess off followed by Poco off and Gamboa on and we do that every week. We have become far too defensive and predictable for the premier league, our objective seems to have changed from lets get the wins and get back to 8th, instead we are going with lets just lose by the smallest margin we can do and hope other teams do worse.

In terms of players there may be stuff I don't know about, maybe on the training ground they're not showing well and I can't see that, but why are we not using players like Varela/Blanco/Ideye when we are struggling for goals, the last goal we actually scored ourselves was in October. Even if they aren't doing the best in training lets give them a chance in a game, maybe it'll boost their confidence or maybe they will do something fantastic, we can't know till we've given them that chance. 

The key one for me in this is Gamboa, we know from the world cup that he can perform all parts of the RB job well, he's got the pace to push forward and then turn round and come back if he needs to, and he can put in a good cross and tackle to boot. Yet he is always playing second fiddle to Wisdom who himself has made a few mistakes and looks better suited to the CB role than the RB, he's got to be the first RB to be outpaced by Cazorla surely. Why not give more playing time to someone we actually bought and can develop than to someone that even if we do develop them will be going back to another club anyway.

Before anyone gets me wrong i'm not saying that we should be beating Chelsea one week, Arsenal the next and then looking to challenge Bayern and Real Madrid. They were small loses and that's okay but at least give it a go, in the big scheme of things whether we lose 1 or 3 nil doesn't matter but if we at least try to win maybe we could.

TL:DR Too negative, too predictable, too stuck in to his ways, time for Irvine to move on.",0,1417344597,null,0,false,0,cmgvrr2,t3_2nst3j,t1_cmgvrr2,t3_2nst3j,null,1425757671,3,false,WBAfootball,t5_2tivu,3

The trappings of a middle class lifestyle have become the preserve of the rich and aspiration to own a modest terrace house in central London has changed from being unambitious a generation ago to unrealistic nowadays. 

A fundamental realignment of priorities is needed at the heart of Westminster and there will have to be a of of pain before things are put right. The property market needs fixing and this is a nettle that needs to be grasped sooner rather than later and in such a way that it plateaus rather than falls. Education needs reworking. Gove, much as he was hated understood this even if he attempted too radical a shift in too short a space of time but we need fewer graduates and more thorough alternatives to higher education in the forms of vocational opportunities. The pension time bomb is already kicking off and the government needs to adopt a BOGOF type scheme to get people to save and reward them for doing so. At least the NHS seems to be doing better with less by syphoning off elements that can be privatised and making better use of resources. 

The Boomers have overspent and left Gen Y to pick up the bill, but this was inadvertent and the extent of this has only become clear over the past 20-25 years.

My friend, a mechanic, was caught without a seatbelt while test driving a car he had just fixed near his garage. He was told to go to court to pay the fine.

A few weeks later he went to court to pay the fine like any honest man. But the judges had a nasty surprise waiting for him. They said there has been a warrant for his arrest for nine years regarding non-payment of a TV licence in 2005. The judges told him they have two options: Send him to jail or ask him to pay a hefty fine.

At no point did the judges inform him of his rights such as a chance to prepare a defence or get advice from a lawyer. He basically turned up to court to pay £50 seatbelt fine and was told upon meeting the judges that they had the choice to send him down for a few months there or then or fine him.

My friend wasn't aware of his rights at all and was just so shocked and worried that he could be jailed and his wife and three young children would have to fend for themselves. He begged the judge there and then to just fine him and not send him to jail. The judges made him grovel and explain why a fine would be better than sending him to jail. My friend just said anything he could think in a panic saying that any him paying a fine is better than the state paying for him in jail. The judges probably saw this as a perfect opportunity to give him a fine that is beyond any reasonable amount for a one time 'offence'.

The best thing about this story is that he had never even received a letter about a TV licence. The backstory is that in 2005 he was preparing to move house and was loading items into a van. He was visited by a man who asked if he could have a look around. He thought the man was a possible future tenant from the landlord. My friend showed the guy around which of course meant he saw all the rooms with TV's. As the man left he told him he was from TV licensing and that he would have a letter for non-payment. My friend insisted he had paid but later found out that his girlfriend (now wife) had cancelled the direct debit two weeks earlier because she knew they were moving.

Anyway, they moved to their new house and received no letters and with the stresses and strains of family life quickly forgot about the incident. That was until he had to pay that particular £50 seat belt fine nine years later and ended up having to pay £1,900 to avoid jail. I deplore the judges for not allowing him time to make a defence and the aggressive nature in which they threatened him with two choices. He had been paying his licence in the nine years since so effectively had to pay almost two grand for a few weeks that had been missed.

It's difficult to mobilise individuals to vote when they don't feel like their vote changes anything, but collectively, these non-voters could make a difference. It always frustrates me when people complain that their vote ""doesn't count"" because they're in a safe seat. Given that elections very rarely swing on one vote, your vote has a vanishingly small chance of counting individually anyway. But maybe your ""safe seat"" would actually be marginal if everyone who couldn't be bothered to vote went out and did so? Not voting is the surest way to ensure that there won't ever be any change.

That the parties don't offer much to younger people is certainly a problem, especially when the Liberal Democrats didn't make a priority of keeping their pledge about tuition fees, furthering disillusionment. I can only hope that we would see more interest in that demographic if they were more politically active, or else a rise in popularity of parties that did represent those interests.

Look you seem like a nice fellow, I've upvoted you in the past according to RES so you must have done right by me then.

But taking easy jabs at a religion for free karma is a little low.

Yes it's something we shouldn't be encouraging in our more enlightened time.

But come on friend all OP asked was ""Can anyone me any advice on my rights and what I can say if they try to dismiss me, and legal options I have.""

So after having worked upon my own ERR Workbook the past couple of weeks it was fresh in my mind that this is indeed a case of discrimination against their religion.

and I grabbed the most relevant sources to their case for their religious belief involved.

So there it is, OP asked for their rights and if they have a case for unfair dismissal.

Turns out they do, we'll see what that advice can do for them and if they choose to go that route.

Barton is an example of this, with some poor passing and regular off-target shots into row Z. Fortunately we were able to score more than we let in.

For me, it wasn't a pleasant game to watch. QPR fans were very quiet, I think we expected to beat Leicester. There was a feeling that after recent performances, we were due 3 points, so it wasn't until late in the game that the crowd got going. When we looked in danger of not winning our players came back concentrated and ruthless, quickly scoring. When that happens I ask myself why we don't do that all the way through the game.

With all due respect to Leicester, they looked like a good quality Championship side, with little individual skill, relying on the counter-attack and our very poor defence; but they are a team we have to beat to stand a chance of staying in this league.

Excellent energy levels from QPR players and great to see a very attacking team, not something we've been used to for many years - 37 shots yesterday (6 on target) - and that was without BZ.

Traoré: Not someone we see play very often. He's another player that needs games. Sitting in X block I had a close view of his performance. His ability to put in a cross is quite amazing. He puts in crosses crosses from seemingly nothing, as he's squeezed into the sideline with no space. I think his crossing ability should be used more often.

Conversely, some people will claim that the Smith Commission has recommended *extensive powers*, nay, ""[Vow Max](http://www.itv.com/news/border/update/2014-11-27/nick-clegg-weve-over-delivered-on-devolution-vow/)"", irrespective of what actually [made it into the final draft](http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/scottish-politics/revealed-the-devolution-powers-shelved-at-the-last-minute-from-smith-comm.25999250).

&gt; Repeat after me: Devo-Max was not promised. Devo-Max was not promised.

Here's a sample of what was promised:

* Gordon Brown, 2014/08/08, ""We’re going to be, within a year or two, **as close to a federal state as you can be** in a country where one nation is 85% of the population.""

* Gordon Brown, 2014/09/08, ""The plan for a stronger Scottish Parliament we seek agreement on is for nothing else than **a modern form of Scottish Home Rule** within the United Kingdom.""

* Danny Alexander, 2014/09/13, ""Scotland will have more powers over its finances, more responsibility for raising taxation and more control over parts of the welfare system - **effective Home Rule** but
within the security and stability of our successful United Kingdom.""

* David Cameron, 2014/09/15, ""If we get a No vote on Thursday, that will trigger a major, **unprecedented programme of devolution** with additional powers for the Scottish Parliament.""

You can easily make the argument that ""oh, well, Gordon Brown doesn't speak for anyone and Cameron/Alexander were just voicing an opinion rather than making an official commitment"".

That seems like a pretty obvious attempt at revisionism though.

The result of the Smith Commission is at best a slight advance on what was already legislated for in the Scotland Act 2012, and it's quite clearly not ""effective Home Rule"" or an ""unprecedented programme of devolution"".

The difficulty with the Smith Commission result is not that it doesn't placate people like the SNP who, as you say, were likely to find fault no matter what (that's hardly news - the Conservatives and Labour were always going to praise it to the hilt no matter what too).

The difficulty is that two months ago Scotland was 190K people away from leaving the UK.

Arguably Scotland already has/will have more powers than say, the states of the USA, so I'd say he certainly kept the promise of a federal UK, at least as Scotland is concerned. 

&gt; Home rule means everything except Defence and foreign affairs. 

Defined by whom? Do you think that's what Gordon Brown meant and *thats* what the party leaders said they agreed with?

Now I'm not saying they had it worse, I'm not saying they had it better, but you are naive if you think we are the first to go through a recession, the first to see cuts in public spending or that tuition fees make going to uni more difficult for us than previous generations (it's a fuck load easier for anybody to go to university post 90's), although tuition fees are of course a step back. 

We have a lot of problems that our generation has, does and will face, but complaining about how easy the previous ones had it is naive and utterly, utterly pointless, they had their problems to face too (impetuous children for example).

false,PJHart86,,Belfast,"Although the extent of the ""boom"" here probably is exaggerated It is still possible to have a viable career, though it is an extremely competitive industry - just as it is in London and elsewhere. 

&gt; The various schemes that run are almost always earmarked for specific individuals, and niscreen are fine for people with existing experience, but useless for new people - unless you're personal friends with them.

I didn't find this to be the case. I wasn't even in the country when I applied for the NI Screen scheme that I eventually got accepted on so there was no personal connection there.

Yes, I had a little bit of experience but it was mostly experience that I had created for myself. it's never been easier to shoot your own stuff so it's hard to be taken seriously if you've never even bothered to take your iphone out of your pocket to film something with it. 

&gt;There's the other matter of basic nepotism that runs right through the industry, so new people aren't exactly welcomed with open arms because they're an unwelcome competition.

This may the true to a certain degree, and cultivating contacts in the industry is key, but MDs at production companies will always be on the look out for skilled/talented people that they can get away with paying very little for as this obviously helps their bottom line and stretches their budgets. If you're looking for runner work, there's no point contacting other runners because, as you rightly say, you'll be competing for the same work.

&gt;None of it will have anything to do with how passionate, capable or talented you are

Actually, this is all it's about. It's not like applying for a job in a bank, you really need to prove how passionate capable and talented you are to employers and there's no better way to do that then getting out there and making your own stuff. Another important skill is being able to deal with failure and rejection. Your first film/sketch/whatever will almost certainly be shite, but if you really are passionate, capable and talented you'll learn from your mistakes and you'll do better next time until eventually someone takes notice.

&gt;And if you don't know anyone (and especially aren't into arselicking) then you're screwed. If you love arselicking you'll probably get something

As I said above, you do need to develop contacts and you do need to develop a thick skin when it comes to rejection. If you aren't the sort of person who is comfortable putting yourself out there, engaging with people you don't know and taking it on the chin when they say no, then this isn't the industry for you whether in Belfast, London or Kathmandu.

&gt;Go to London if you're serious, and if you can afford it. The opportunities here are virtually nil. 

""if you can afford it"" is the key here. Entry level positions in the media are always for very low to no pay and London is a VERY expensive place to live, especially if you have no support structure around you. The industry in London is EXTREMELY ruthless and you'll find yourself doing a lot more work for the same low/no money as you would do here.



To OP I would say that the media industry is very competitive and a very tough nut to crack, but if you're serious about it - and you can't live off your trust fund from a flat in shoreditch while you shop yourself around - then Belfast is as good a place as any to at least start building a base of experience.",0,1417354848,null,0,false,0,cmgxj00,t3_2nu3n7,t1_cmgxj00,t1_cmgw91s,null,1425756852,4,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,4

Perhaps it's different where you live, but in a lot of places around the country the ladder has well and truly been pulled up after the last generation. Hard work no longer goes far enough. Those who get ahead *got lucky:* usually family ties or family funds.

Anyone who says ""you wouldn't just give up"" has never really struggled. Even the come-from-nothing success stories realise that they *could* have given up. That failure was a real option. A risk that they avoided through whatever means, not something that only happens to other people. The narrative that thinking supports is the narrative that turfs disabled people off their benefits to starve.

The point, beautifully illustrated by comments on here, is that this story rings a bell with a lot of us. It doesn't apply directly to every soul from 19 to 31 in the entire country, but not every young person loved disco, or fought in the war, or saw the Berlin Wall fall first-hand. It still says something relevant and important about a non-negligible segment of our society.

It's what Irish home rule meant, it's what Indian home rule meant. It's what the term home rule historically means.

I don't think he wanted that, but he wanted people to think that's what he meant. Devo-max would have won overwhelmingly, it was Gordon Brown's job to convince people devo-max was on offer.

Also, I'm not half the half-wit you seem to have convinced yourself I am. For starters, I have no difficulty believing you're a feminist - I also don't really think that fact is relevant here. Are you under the impression that feminists never disagree with each other?

Secondly, the study you found was both older than the one I linked to and based in the US - this means that its findings are explained by the second, more recent study, which, again, displays the lack of ceteris paribus in previous studies finding opposite results. I mean, come on, you knew that was the obvious answer, right? 

&gt; FWIW, the solution I see is for fathers to pick up the slack, not for mothers to stop working. 

Exactly. In which case though, why the lack of studies examining the link between childhood obesity and fathers' contributions to child care or - for that matter - working dads? Or even better, instead of pretending that correlation equals causation, why not concentrate on things that probably are relevant factors like parental education levels, pricing of healthy eating options, ingredients in preserved food (much less heavily regulated in the US than here), hours worked by both parents (likely much more significant than simple working status), state support for parents in the form of such things as parental leave, state support for workers rights in general (in the US they only get 15 days - that's surely unhealthy for everybody, not just children) or the obvious elephant in the room of the surrounding eating culture?

Look, I know you've gotten it into your head somehow that I'm a feminazi psychobitch or whatever, but if you try to imagine for a second that I'm actually a reasonable, honestly rather intelligent (if I say so myself) thinking person, you might find I'm actually not all that wrong here. 

The past was never the utopia of cheap housing, happy couples and healthy children /u/ArtistEngineer (by his own admittance rather emotional on this topic at the moment) was trying to make it out to be. When we allowed half of our workforce to actually work to the best of their abilities, our quality of life went drastically up, not down. And the children of working mothers have overall better outcomes in life, as you're expect would be the case with greater financial stability and prosperity. 

And even if all this is about idle imagining - how nice it would be if one partner was financially dependent on the other! - why not go the whole hog and simply talk about how nice it would be if *nobody* had to work. And honestly, I'd be all for a minimum income system that meant that only whose who wanted to had to work. But again, lets not pretend that harkening back to a time of stay-at-home parents is not sexist, because simply declaring that you're a feminist while saying it does not fix that.

Mangala played quite well too and he really had no choice on that second yellow. I've not much else to say about him. He is good, but still the amount of cards he's been getting is concerning.

Clichy has really stepped up. Been great on both ends of the pitch and he even got himself his first goal. Very good for him after some awful games earlier on.

And best of all, Yaya actually gave a shit today and him and Fernandinho absolutely bossed Southampton's midfield even with Schneiderlin. Nasri was great today too.

Aguero really shut up the cunts on /r/soccer calling us a one-man team at Bayern or calling him selfish at Swansea. Brilliant game from him even without a goal to his name.

Navas has been really average and was maybe our only bad player today. I really struggle to see what he adds to the team except for giving us lots of corners we're not going to do anything with. Nasri has been more successful with his crosses and defenders seem to have his game worked out. Milner should be starting instead of him.

Bullshit, you have the loudest voice and you could have done so much if you just got your act together. You *easily* outvote the other home nations. Hell, as far as westminster issues are concerned if you win over England you win over Britain.

By the next election there will be a nice, round number of 600 MPs. 502 are English, 30 are Welsh, 52 are Scottish and 16 Northern Irish. 502 against 98 is nothing. Your MPs outnumber the other home nations  over 5 to 1. Hell, it was one of the reasons why many people I know voted Yes on the referendum, because they feel that as far as UK issues are concerned. they'll get dragged along with the English vote. Holy balls, do you guys not realise the epic power that exists in your vote? If you vote and campaign in the right way, you could get anything you want. *Anything!* English MPs can even vote to overrule the Parliaments and assemblies on all matters without the consent of the devolved admins or the people living under them (Now there's another version of the West Lothian question that I would like to call the East Lothian question). You can get your way if you so wish, take a leaf out the Scot's book and campaign, you'll get your way easier because nobody wants to piss off most, if not all of their voters.

&gt;And yes you are right , leaving the EEC will obviously be a UK matter and not just us English, but this is the only chance we had to voice any opinion.

Not with that attitude. But yes, if put to a vote, the UK will leave the EU, the good points be damned. England, as a whole wants to leave but Scotland wants to stay, and England can easily outvote Scotland so we'll be leaving the EU unless the EU dramatically reforms. Mind you even if it does we'll still leave because often in these cases the heart and the knee rule the head and the hand.

But to finish, the lie that the English are powerless is bullshit. You hold the keys to number Ten as the largest nation. The political landscape didn't change in Scotland in the last election but it did in England and we ended up with a Tory led ~~abusive relationship~~ ""coalition"". You have the power, go on and use it. As long as you don't try and dominate the rest of the UK with more powers, I will support you as an Anglo-Scot, and Scots in general will support you as your noisy northern Neighbours.

He tells you to look around at your fellow man. To notice everything. And then he tells you to do better. And of course this man is fiction. Hes an actor playing a role. But behind every new face, the Doctor is still there. Telling you, if not indirectly, to be amazing. And I think that is why people love the doctor. No matter how many different people you are in your life. No matter how many different faces you have. You work face. Your home face. Your friend face. No matter how many different people you become in your life, you have to remember that the universe is an amazing place and every day you wake up from your bed is a chance to be amazing. And I think that is what I get out of it. That is why I love the Doctor.

false,joylongdivision,null,null,"Well, back to earth I suppose. The only real disappointing thing about this game was how poorly we played after going a man down: we were always underdogs regardless of our table position. 

While I admire Koeman's dedication to attacking and flowing football, I fear there might be a bit of Wenger-syndrome there given our performances against ""big"" sides. I actually like Yoshida, but his inclusion was just *weird*: halftime is not the time you decide you want to put in another CB and sit back and defend: either do it from the beginning, when you're leading, or don't do it at all. But he's still great, he's adapted to the prem fantastic (better than Poch for sure), and he's getting there. Think this game may have been a bit of a tactical brainfart though.

As others have said though, would like to see Long start. I've said it before, I like Mane as he's really the only player we've got who's eager to run at defenders and take them on, but no use playing him if the end product isn't there and he won't know what to do with the ball until he's past them. Long on the other hand can be a bit of a headless chicken at times, but I think that's more of what we need against teams like City, we really lacked consistency this game.

false,EdgarAllanBro_,null,null,"My mother grew up in a small town in the rural West Midlands. Her parents separated in 1962 when she was 6 (mother moved back to hometown leaving father in the city 40 miles away) and were definitely divorced by 1967/8 because he married another woman that year. Divorce was UNHEARD OF in the 1960s outside probably the aristocracy who have always had their own rules.

There was a huge amount of social stigma, people would whisper on the streets and cross the road to avoid my grandmother, and she could never have set foot in a church. My mum said she was the only child in her primary school who had divorced parents, and when she was small one of her teachers pointed out in front of everyone how little Timmy's mother was A Good Woman because she was a widow whereas little Sarah's mother was A Bad Woman (basically a slut) because she got divorced.

I should point out that there was almost certainly domestic violence or other serious abuse going on because it was my grandmother's own father who insisted she leave her husband and bought her a house to move back to (with him as he was widowed). They were affluent, respected long-time members of the community and still faced all of this outrage. My grandmother could never have remarried, no one would have had her as she was little better than a whore in their eyes. Even though with a modern outlook, she was very much the victim.

Child support was definitely paid. I don't know the system but it was definitely in place. My grandfather, as far as I can tell, received nothing but pity and didn't have to carry any shame or stigma around. He remarried and his second daughter grew up not having a clue about his past marriage, because no one talked about it or gossiped about him.

I think that's it but feel free to ask any questions, I'll try and answer as best I know.

PS you could definitely get divorced long before the 60s though. My great grandmother ran away from her husband in 1924 and moved back in with her parents - a divorce definitely happened at some point, because he married again, though I don't know many details on that one.",0,1417366412,null,0,1417366656,0,cmh16qp,t3_2nlshf,t1_cmh16qp,t3_2nlshf,null,1425755090,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

I lived in Chesham for 3 years, which has a Met line station, until 2 years ago and then moved to a smaller town, Prestwood (has a parent town Great Missenden, with a national rail station). 

I think Chesham was nice, but if you like a town with things going on (cinema, shopping centre, etc), try a larger town like High Wycombe (edit: or Aylesbury). Chesham does have a fair amount of pubs and coffee shops, and lots of charity shops. ""Things going on"" are not valuable to me, and right now I don't mind having to travel half an hour to get to the larger towns. Unfortunately only Chesham and Amersham have Underground stations.

The reason for moving out of Chesham was financial - my (immigrant) parents wanted to finally buy a house before they retire, and there was a house to buy for them here. When I move out, I'd consider living in any town around here (including Chesham) if the conditions are right.

Statistically the whole area is also [really expensive, compared to other places outside London](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23234033). But I dislike cities, and suburbs feel like the countryside compared to London, where I lived between 2003 and 2008 (when I was still in school). Before that I lived in Pretoria (ZA), also a big city.

Expect reciprocal international agreements on student loan payments within 10 years. The world is steadily globalising, and people like your mate are not going to be able to get away with this forever. 

Within 20 years, I'm pretty sure it *will* be possible to bankrupt student loan defaulters and seize their property *(edit: or, realistically, just garnish their wages)*, at least in countries like Aus, Canada and the USA.

I wouldn't be at all surprised if we got together with these countries and said ""look, here's the deal, if we give someone from your country a visa, we'll become liable for collecting their student loans"". In that case, all of a sudden, Canada would be handing the UK the £20,000 or £30,000 that your mate owes, and coming after him directly.

Having said that, your mate probably isn't breaking any laws at present, and the interest rate on his mortgage is probably higher than that on his student loan, so he may be financially better off postponing his loan repayments (but IMO he should be stashing money away in safe longterm savings to prepare for when the SLC catch up with him).",0,1417367291,null,0,1417377660,0,cmh1k6k,t3_2ntond,t1_cmh1k6k,t3_2ntond,null,1425754916,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2

 Dread is not telling the complete truth here as many more players have been removed from the Skype group.

 The term ""Autism"" is constantly used in the Uk Dota2 community and meme or not most of you use it as an easy way of describing someone who is usually being a complete cunt because he thinks he wont be called out on it.. I personally dont think we should be calling eachother that as its not accurate.

Most of you seem to have gotten poor information on the Hunter/Kaneo vomit situation as you dont even attend LAN and well... sheep being sheep...  He was sick some went on his trousers he changed them but did not shower.

On a final note. The skype group... This is not really an elitist group of players lft,its more of an elitist group of players who have been in teams then get kicked as they cannot control their ego's and attitudes for long. Possibly in the past the skype group was productive but now its complete shit.

* England = 53,012,456
* Wales = 3,063,456
* NI = 1,841,245
* Scotland = 5,327,700

You'll see England is ~84% of the population. Breaking England down into population by [List of English districts by population](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_districts_by_population) is probably more applicable concerning Representation and Democracy.

However if you compare as part of the EU:- Regions of the EU:-

* South East = 8,634,750
* London = 8,173,941
* North West = 7,052,177
* East of England = 5,846,965
* West Midlands = 5,601,847
* South West = 5,288,935
* Yorkshire and the Humber = 5,283,733
* East Midlands = 4,533,222
* North East = 2,596,886

It's more comparable to Scotland, Wales, NI.

However now we have a level comparison, let's ask another question: What is the optimal size for Direct Democracy of Localism of Democracy? And how is that best fitted into a Nation State Federal System?

I don't think these regions + an English Parliament + UK Parliament is a very good system. I'd recommend English Districts + Federal UK system and remove the ""middle-man"" Regions of 1-5 million units.

false,Paludosa2,null,null,"&gt; Can I ask why in other EU countries being a member simply doesn't appear to be an issue?

Hmm, some observations:-

1. ""anti-EU, eurosceptic"" parties across EU are very diverse
2. There diversity indicates various major differences between what their local/national issues with the EU are.
3. One unifying features which you point out with the AfD = dislike with the EURO.

Eg: [Watch out Eurocrats, here come the Pirates!](http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/9108492/here-come-the-pirates/)

However to come back that the UK is sort of unique (apart from Cyprus for obvious reasons!), then yes it does appear to be so.

Why is that? For a multitude of reason:-

* Historic
* Cultural
* Treaty Negotiations
* Economic and Political and Legal

Let's go through these very briefly:-

1. Historic: The UK had an Empire before then strong Commonwealth ties with the rWorld. Heath or Wilson I forget wanted both Common Market and Commonwealth trade so joined. The reason for this need was the WWII Loans from America and paying them back via Britain as well as losses of Empire and War had depleted the UK economy. Unfortunately joining the Common Market meant signing up to rules that led to loss of Commonwealth trade links.
2. Cultural: The UK as an island and former Global Empire has always had a different identity to Continental Europe and taught as such. More could be said of this but you get the gist. I could lend some funny jokes here to make the point for example.
3. Due to our Treaty negotiations eg Rebate Thatcher, and Maastricht Opt-Out of the EURO Major after the ERM fiasco, the UK is the singular different EU member not legally bound to join. Effectively De Gaulle kept us out for a decade then since joining we've been attempting to exert our own interests which ALWAYS were: Trade &gt; Politics: See Winston Churchill's speech below. This totally contrasts with the founding father of the EU = Jean Monnet who always intended since about 1920's that it would alway always be Political &gt; Trade ie United States of Europe.
4. The UK has a different legal system Common Law vs Roman Law, our Parliamentary Sovereignty is also different in various respects and our economy is a major one that again exerts influence that also requires more trade globally due to our Global links such as with the USA and so on. These all put the British into deeper contention with the EU

&gt;*""We have our own dream and our own task. We are with Europe but not of it. We are linked but not comprised. We are interested and associated but not absorbed"".*

~ Winston Churchill

Coming back to Cameron and the Tories: I must check your assumption here: The Tories have allowed the signing of the most Major Treaties with the EU out of anyone. To claim they are Anti-EU is contrary to the track-record evidence.

For example using a very crude voting on EU in Parliament proxy measurement (very crude but useful) from data provided by Bruges Group using their MP Watch tool:-

[Conservatives voting on EU track record of MPs](http://s1004.photobucket.com/user/Suri42/media/MPWatchConsRating.png.html?sort=3&amp;o=0)

Cleary the Tories are a majority mild to strong Pro-EU party with a small faction of very strong Eurosceptics.

What you suggest is that they APPEAR to be most beligerent: But this part of our adversarial political system of communication as well as the influence of the above on our attitude to the EU and finally a balancing act of the Tories who with Major's signing of the Maastricht Treaty gave birth to:-

&gt;UKIP !!

The Mordred of British Politics! Coming back to working constructively with the EU: This is limited by:-

&gt;Treaty Structures themselves of 28 members, EU instutions formal voting process in the Parliament and the Council too.

To attempt to fit the UK into the same block as for example Greece is logically not sound as we're seeing with Greece + Germany in the EZ.

Chiriches I think is a bit risk and reward, he can make defensive mistakes like the back pass, and then he is dangerous going up the wing, and that pass from the throw in to Soldado! 

Fazio looked good to me, calm and looks like he has things under control. Davies as well did a good job today.

Mason was wasteful and should have come on for Paulinho or Moussa. 

I'm really happy that players that we were starting to cross off have been playing and showing that they want it, for instance Lennon, Paulinho and Chiriches.

I loved Poch's celebrations and the Soldado's celebration, everyone was so happy for him. Anyone else spot Paulinho's celebration on the bench?

Basically there was an agreement that all the partisans would take orders from the Greek government.  The communist partisan group refused to do so, and refused to disarm either.  Basically an armed insurrection, by a subgroup of the Greek population, against the legitimate government of an allied country, while ww2 was still going on.

The pro-axis group referred to is general grivas' movement.  I think it's a stretch to call them pro-axis, probably.  In any case they were a minor element fighting on the same side as the Greek government.  I don't think there was any love lost between grivas and the British - only a few years later he was killing british soldiers in the Cyprus emergency. As a result, he's a big hero in Cyprus (lots of statues and museums to his exploits in the Paphos area in particular).

Howard - 5 - Should have done better with the goal. Didn't really have much else to do.

Coleman - 6 - Didn't look up for it. Better in the second half.

Jagielka - 7 - Couple of important tackles.

Distin - 6 - Dunno why he seemed intent on letting Harry Kane do whatever he wanted all afternoon.

Baines - 4 - Possibly the worst I've seen him play for us. I really thought he was awful at everything today.

Besic - 6 - Generally tidy, still had his stupid moments though.

Barry - 7 - Usual Barry, didn't really do anything wrong.

Mirallas - 7 - Great goal, went very quiet after that though.

Barkley - 7 - Good performance, but still never really created any chances for anyone.

Eto'o - 5 - Not his game at all. I would have replaced him with Pienaar at half time.

Lukaku - 6 - Didn't do anything wrong, but his team let him down so much that he didn't have much opportunity to do anything good either.

McGeady - 5 - Completely anonymous.

Osman - 6 - Fine, but that's all.

Generally a poor performance. They looked like the same slow, predictable and static side that started the season, and I refuse to believe that a two day trip to Germany is the reason for that. Spurs are by no stretch of the imagination a great side (otherwise they would have created some more proper chances and taken us to pieces), but I think they absolutely had our number today.

false,Baggzio,newcr-1,You Signed Lambert We Signed No One At All!!,"That wasn't the nicest thing to watch. We are back to Distin and Jags being shite and uncomfortable on the ball being unable to pass. Howard was bad too and I know that the Americans around here will probably have a go since he's obviously the best player ever even though ye probably only started watching football in the summer and ""cheer"" for us when we win. He's been getting away with it now for a while and maybe the first goal was a bit much even though I think he could've done better the second was dreadful, any half decent keeper would've at least batted it out of play or something. Awful. Baines and Coleman had quite games too, just wasn't working when it needed to.

Barry was proper bad today, misplaced too many passes and like with their second, regardless if it was a foul which lets be honest it wasn't, just being too slow to give it and holding it far too long inviting tackles. Besic was easily MOTM for me, seemed like the only one, aside from Ross, who knew actually what he was supposed to do and how to do it correctly. He defended well and passed well, with Barry's performance today I'd like to see Macca and Besic given a good run together in the team.

 Eto'o was another who wasn't great and needed to be taken off at half time in my opinion. Mirallas class again no clue why he was taken off seemed to be the only real attacking threat up to then. This is a special message to Bobby: ROSS IS NOT A WINGER! Again today Ross played well when Eto'o went off because he was in his correct position instead of switching with Eto'o every 2 minutes. It's a case of square pegs in round holes really. 

Rom didn't have much today but I got the feeling that if it was given to him he'd be able to do something with it and I haven't feel that way about him this season until recently. Looks like he's gonna fulfil his potential and price tag, really coming into his own.

As for the subs, as I said it was all wrong (again!!!). Mirallas shouldn't have been taken off but Eto'o should've. It should've been McGeady for Eto'o and have two actual wingers playing on the wing. Once Mirallas went off it was almost always on the right and that's obviously predictable. Roberto needs to stop playing players where they simply can't because it worsens the whole team. Play wingers on the wing, strikers up front and attacking midfielders in the number 10. It's not that hard to figure out..

Anyway bad day, need a new goalkeeper sooner rather than later and a new centre back in January even though Roberto's already said he won't get a centre back because he's too stubborn and would claim ""youth can do it"" while probably sticking Hibbert and Osman in two centre backs before using Browning or Galloway.... Not too optimistic for next week too I'm afraid after City hammered the most in form team in the league after not playing too well and getting a player sent off...

You know, and I know, that theft is wrong (or at least illegal). It's a simple bit of old fashioned morality.

&gt;Instead this sort of rhetoric reinforces the idea that men are all rapists waiting for an opportunity to strike. 

That's not what the poster suggests. All it is doing is reminding the viewer about whether or not consent could be given if the other party is wankered.

While I hate to read negative stories about Northern Ireland, it's still good to be reminded that racism is a big problem in Belfast, and how it's being looked upon internationally. 

This isn't good for us at all. Many people are calling for a cut in corporation tax in order to increase foreign investment in Northern Ireland, but who would want to invest in a place like this were racism is still a big issue.
