Until I experienced SFE this last year I didn't realise what complete and utter incompetency really truly was. They are head and shoulders beyond anything I've seen in my 43 years on this earth.

For example they claim they didn't receive my marriage certificate and my kids birth certificates. So I spend a ton of money and time getting copies from the various registry offices and send them off again. What do I get when they return all my documentation? The originals they claim they never received and the copies. Can I get compensation for the cost?

Then there's the fact things don't get updated and they send 6 letters out over a period of two months asking for information they already have which is all well and good but when its the middle of September they're asking this and you've got to prove you have the finance for tuiton fees in place a week later its stress not needed.

I could go on and on but I'm quite sure those who have been unfortunate enough to experience it know too well.

When the team has played well, when we have won under Tim it seems much less tied to tactics, ideas or philosophy and more reliant on moments of individual brilliance....problem being Tim doesn't seem to put the players in a position to consistently have the opportunity to really succeed, to be in a position to have a moment of brilliance consistently.

There does seem to be a disconnect, and i can't say i am surprised.  This is a team full of high end internationals players who have played under the likes of LvG (Dembele at AZ), Blanc/Deschamps, Del Bosque, SAF, Capello and Scolari. They have been part of organizations like Real Madrid, Ajax and United. These are players that have played in the Champions league, that have played an won in major tournaments, have won respective league championships, this is a squad full of players who have the capability to win.

These are effectively a squad of winners, a group of individuals who understand the emotional requirements to win, they understand passion.  They need guidance on tactics, they need guidance on how to succeed within the framework of the team's overall plan.

I have maintained for a while now that the team may like Tim (and at this point i am questioning how many actually like him) but they don't respect him, he has given them no reason to respect him. He seems incapable of providing the squad what it needs, a framework for success.

Tim is in over his head as a manager and is struggling to put forward any ideas that would put the squad into a situation where they can consistently succeed.

Really? So you're saying that if someone is racist, and a person agrees with that racist on any subject, whether or not it is related to racism, then that person is also implicitly racist? That sounds completely ridiculous to me. I've read that Hitler was vegetarian. Are all vegetarians implicitly anti-semites, because they offer an opinion in support of Hitler?

You say that the Quenelle ""may not be racist in context"", but I've yet to see anyone offer any context one way or another. The general attitude seems to be ""Ask a Frenchman,"" as far as I can tell from a cursory google search, the Quenelle is closer to gutter humor than it is to anti-Semitism.

It does sound silly to say ""we invaded to help"", but they had extremists going around blowing up civilians, and their own governments proved extremely ineffective at stopping them. There is a certain point where you have to step in and clamp down forcefully. 

On a simpler plane, it's like reprimanding someone for acting out against a bully. Telling them they had no place to fight back, that if they had just let it go and done nothing about it, maybe the violence would stop. 

Or maybe it would intensify when they thought they could get away with it.


I don't condone war, and very rarely celebrate killing, but ""Victim of a circumstance"" or not. If your aim is to kill people that are in no way involved in a conflict, I will be happy that you're out of the picture. 


At the end of the day it really is all about who has the bigger stick, and who is willing to use it. I wish it weren't, but if the bigger stick means making 2 countries better off, I'm all for it.

2) Due to Muslims paying a percentage of their income to charity.

3) Muslims judges shouldn't interfere with actions of non-Muslims unless they wish to use Sharia law

4) For those special taxes those who pay are permitted to practice their faith, to enjoy a measure of communal autonomy, to be entitled to the Muslim state's protection from outside aggression, and to be exempted from military service and the Zakat taxes obligatory upon Muslim citizens.

5)There are two views on this tax, one is that it replaces Zakat (tax that Muslims pay to the poor) and that the right of freedom and protection are birthrights. The other belief is that this tax grants the right of religious freedom and a status of protection.


I'm a former Muslim, I know for the most part where the flaws lie and where they don't and this is an example of claims used within improper context.

I've been feeling confident about us for the past few weeks because the side's been displaying it. They go out there and have a fucking run about. Look at the goal celebrations - look how happy everyone is. They're a side with nothing to lose *and they know it*.

Of course, now that we've all soared this high there is something to lose. The title is close enough to make the supporters dream, and it has to be in the back of everyone's minds at the club. But the thing is we don't play like a club gunning for the title. That's Chelsea losing to Palace and City drawing with Arsenal. Those teams play with expectation, that everyone including themselves expect to win the title. Anything less is failure.

Meanwhile, we were expected to be at most champions league participants heading into next season, not title defenders. We've met our expectation. Everything from this point is gravy. So we go out and beat the shit out of teams and have a great time doing it. Sherwood thought we might get a case of the nerve '...all the best'.   

Now of course this doesn't mean we aren't in fact gunning for the title. It's Stevie's mentality projected onto ten other players - we will fight for everything. They're trying to win it for him. And when you combine this will to win with the fact that we have nothing to lose you get a fantastic side that has been on absolute fire recently. We've beaten the four teams challenging for fourth by an aggregate 16-1 at home. I believe we can do it. Stevie made me.

Do you feel had your defense also not been as injury-prone you'd have actually had a pretty good season, or do you think your tactics would have slowed you down no matter how healthy your backline was?",0,1396407334,null,0,false,0,cghvb58,t3_21x9sn,t1_cghvb58,t1_cghck1w,null,1433171597,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

If I were objectively asked then whether we were the best team in the land, the most deserving of the title - I think no, I wouldn't have said we were. We got a lot of draws, a lot of what you could call negative play, 1-0 wins etc. 

This year feels different. For the calendar year of 2014, we are undoubtedly the best team in the land. We play with such verve, such togetherness, and with such amazing application of Rodgers' tactical vision. 

So --- yes, it makes me nervous. Because though I'll be made up if we're 3rd or better, a thought that never struck my mind last August, now these 7 months later... we're the best team in the land. And it makes me nervous to think that any slip in the next 6 games could cost us what is truly so well deserved. 

I am especially nervous against teams such as West Ham, who will park the bus, cars, trains and trolleys. All space will be smothered and yet we'll have to find a way to win. 540 minutes of agony and ecstasy - here we come.

And Rafa is at odds with the owners literally in every club's he's been. He publicly spoke out against them in Valencia, he cried like a baby about his interim tag here at Chelsea. The reason he's so deified by you guys, beside the Big Cup reason, it's that he happened to pick his fight with the owners when the fans were also hating their guts and Rafa had a working class martyrdom around him.

I can asfely say that it's been like day and night between last season and this season.

I also found that taking one before I go out drinking and the morning after normally removes my hangover headache (alcoholic drinks have varying levels of histamine in them - red wine being one of the highest). I'm not condoning the use of them with high levels of alcohol though, as some reports say this isn't good for you.

true,The-Darkest-Knight,num19,,"Here's something to put those numbers into... perspective? This is from the club's 2012 Annual Report:

**Financial highlights** 

Revenue for the year was Â£144.2m (2011: Â£163.5m) while operating profit excluding football trading was Â£14.2m 
(2011: Â£32.3m). The lower revenue in the current year is due to the lack of UEFA Champions League football which 
produced record high revenues in the prior year 
 
**Revenue** 

Premier League gate receipts rose as did domestic cup competitions, with the Club reaching the Semi-Finals of the FA 
Cup at Wembley Stadium and the Third Round of the Carling Cup. The Stadium continued to sell out for all Premier 
League home games further underlining the need for an increased capacity stadium to meet demand and satisfy a 
waiting list that rose to 39,000 during this period. 
 
The Club did not progress past the Group Stages in the UEFA Europa League and as a result gate receipts and prize 
money from UEFA competitions fell to Â£6.4m (2011: Â£37.1m). 
 
In domestic cup competitions, the Club reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup at Wembley Stadium and the third round 
of the Carling Cup, earning the Club Â£3.6m (2011: Â£1.9m). 
 
Media and broadcasting revenues increased by 10% to Â£59.2m (2011: Â£54.0m) largely due to a higher number of 
televised games as the Club finished 4th in the Premier League (2011: 5th). 
 
Sponsorship and corporate hospitality income increased by 10% to Â£35.1m from Â£31.8m. In the main this is due to 
increased revenue from the main shirt sponsor deal. 
 
Merchandising income fell by 4% to Â£9.2m (2011: Â£9.6m) mainly due to a drop in sales caused by the lack of UEFA Champions League participation. 

***********

Long story short - yes, it's a fairly big chunk of potential revenue and we as a club should be aiming for Champions league each year.

The other problem is crosstalk, where the signal on other people's lines leaks onto yours and vice versa, reducing the maximum speed even more. There are things BT are trying out (vectoring) to see if this can be reduced/eliminated. They could also go for line bonding to increase speeds. Or, far off, they could finish the job and install full fibre to the premises.

I'm about 350-400 metres from my cabinet and when I first got fibre, the technician's tester and my modem claimed I could get 150Mbps. Now that everyone in the street has signed up, the maximum is currently closer to the 70Mbps I actually get. Hopefully vectoring is successful, BT rolls it out, and I can get something closer to that original estimate again.

Not that Virgin is really any better - they can promise whatever speeds they want, but it doesn't mean their network can take it.

Coutinho is honestly not a pure CAM as people often seem to think. He drops way deeper than your typical number 10. 

He's basically a floater. Suso, ideally, will have the same sort of freedom. And really when you look at our team it's all about fluidity and movement. Joe Allen is up in attack way more than his ability dictates he should be. Just the same Coutinho is deeper way more than his defensive ability dictates it should be. 

This is because everyone does a bit of everything. It's working because everyone is on the same page.

My big hope is that if we (and I assume we will) make a summer signing in attack, Rodgers doesn't just drop the lad into the first 11. We're where we are because this is a UNIT.

Read that article. Clegg gets more than double the coverage of Farage. 

&gt;UKIP's coverage was disproportionate for a long time- that's part of the reason they've clawed their way up to their position in the polls.

No it wasn't. They've been around for 20 years and only in the last couple of years have got more coverage than the smaller parties and that's because of their EU and polling success. 

&gt;Their coverage is proportional to their poll standings now. But they didn't deserve anything like that level of attention for the past couple of years.

They've been polling around 10% for about 2 years now which was similar to the lib dems. Based on the polls then they've deserved the coverage they're getting for quite a while. ",0,1396426420,null,0,false,0,cgi0ixo,t3_21wq8i,t1_cgi0ixo,t1_cghqewl,null,1433174056,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Flying-Fox,null,null,"The highly competitive arts' and creative industries will look at what you can do, rather than your piece of paper, unless you are going into something like media law.  Even then if that kind of work interests you you could consider policy or copyright areas.

Art galleries, ballet companies, theatres: they all have jobs other than artist, dancer, actor roles.

People who work in these fields managing the business, operating the lights, setting up the scenery and properties - many of these people will have arrived there from a variety of backgrounds.  Some will have degrees, from a variety of subject areas.

What is sought is genuine passion, and skills.

If you want to work at a large public art gallery ring your favourite ones up, ask to speak to someone in personnel, set a telephone meeting time if they are busy, and let him or her know how much you want to work there.  Then ask them how you can get there from where you are.  Ask their advice about what voluntary work would help, what roles are most likely to be suitable for young people, that sort of thing.  Then volunteer and skill up.  You need to start thinking of where is the most amazing and exciting place for you to work, and start heading over there.  

Make a list of the ten places you would most like to work if qualifications and experience didn't matter.  Then start heading in that direction.  Ring each place up and talk to them.  

You might end up somewhere even more interesting to you on the way to your top ten.

Radio and television are great because if you volunteer at a community station you really will learn skills you can use to get yourself paid work.

In on my phone so I can't provide many links but it definitely sounds like this would engage both Article 8 and the Data Protection Act, see here: www.yourrights.org.uk/yourrights/privacy/other-types-of-surveillance/cctv-surveillance.html

Then again, I know the DPA doesn't cover external home use (I.e. to protect against burglary) so idk how lucky you'd be with that. It would definitely be tenuous to convince him with the law, though I think that it should come down on your side. 

I'd suggest going to the landlord and that they should intervene. If it comes to it, you could all threaten to leave; a landlord would far rather have one guy leave because he can't spy on his roommates than have four guys leave because of a douchebag who's still in the flat and who will make finding future long term tenants difficult. 

Is there anything in your lease about common parts/shared areas? I don't think many leases would anticipate the sort of paranoia your flatmate's exhibiting, but it's worth a shot.

Good!

We want more younger people to get involved though, because these things *are* relevant, to everyone.


Regarding nuclear policy, I won't try and talk you into changing your opinion but I will say that even as a Green Party member myself, there are definitely policies that don't reflect my personal opinions. However, *overall* I find I agree with far more of the Green Party policies and aims than I do of any other party. I'd guess most people don't agree with every single thing the Conservatives, Labour or the Lib Dems do or promise either, but they pick the one that most closely matches their views and vote for that because realistically, unless you start your own party, the chances are there'll never be one that 100% reflects everything you believe. 


I personally was attracted to the Greens less by their environmental stance (though it is a plus) and more by their outlook on education, healthcare, crime and housing.

As a recent vape convert I personally think this is ridiculous. This is the first time I haven't had cigarettes in over 20 years and I was a pretty heavy roll-up smoker. 

Patches don't work for me, gum doesn't work for me, inhallors are completely useless, in fact anything available on the NHS has been a waste of time for me.  

The vape however is great. It doesn't leave a smell, the vapour doesn't linger, it has no tar, no carbon monoxide, no carcinogens. It doesn't even look like a cigarette. The vapour won't get other people addicted either - basically what happened to me as a kid on long car journeys with my parents smoking. I was addicted way before I ever started smoking. 

 I can even regulate and reduce the nicotine content of the e-liquid over time.  

As a smoker who's been desperate to quit for a long time, what is the fucking problem here? 

No doubt they'll now be talk of heavy regulated, the cottage industry will be kicked out and the tobacco companies will come back with a way inferior product. I'd actually bet on that happening right now.

Maybe you can get home tickets, or I don't know if Palace have any kind of neutral section of the ground, but you don't have a hope of an away ticket  without paying over the odds for hospitality packages or through scalpers. 

Away tickets are sold officially from the club website a few weeks before the game. They go on sale first to people who have a load of away matches on their membership from the previous season, then to people with fewer, and then fewer again, and then usually they've sold out long before they get close to general sale. 

Details for the Palace game aren't released yet, but for comparison tickets to the West Ham United game this weekend [sold out at the point where you needed 8 away games from last season to qualify](http://www.liverpoolfc.com/tickets/latest-ticket-news) (it actually sold out at 10, 8 games was just for the resale). 

You basically need to be on the LFC membership scheme to get tickets to *any* non-friendly game through official channels, but for away games in particular you're completely screwed unless you already went to loads the previous season. I've been trying to rack up away games for years and it's basically impossible to get onto the ladder because except for cup games they always sell out with at least four to six games from last season required.

As a recent vape convert I personally think this is ridiculous. This is the first time I haven't had cigarettes in over 20 years and I was a pretty heavy roll-up smoker. 

Patches don't work for me, gum doesn't work for me, inhallors are completely useless, in fact anything available on the NHS has been a waste of time for me.  

The vape however is great. It doesn't leave a smell, the vapour doesn't linger, it has no tar, no carbon monoxide, no carcinogens. It doesn't even look like a cigarette. The vapour won't get other people addicted either - basically what happened to me as a kid on long car journeys with my parents smoking. I was addicted way before I ever started smoking. 

 I can even regulate and reduce the nicotine content of the e-liquid over time.  

As a smoker who's been desperate to quit for a long time, what is the fucking problem here? 

No doubt they'll now be talk of heavy regulation, the cottage industry will be kicked out and the tobacco and/or pharmaceutical companies will come back with a way inferior product. I'd actually bet on that happening right now.

Yet that wasn't really your point, was it? So, let me try again...they're exempt from tax, I believe, because their opportunities for employment are not equal to that of ordinary people and not always in a good way. Prince Andrew might have earned a pretty penny doing his ""business trips"" but I'm sure you'll remember the kind of hot water he was dropped in once word got out about how excessive these were. The Queen's job right now is simple...be the Queen. Dunno about you but I've not seen too many openings for that lately.

You spoke of the power of veto, yet declined to mention when such a power was used. The permanent members of the UN Security Council also possess a Veto, but whether it is used or not, the only people that have a problem with that are those that don't. Which raises the interesting question of: If everyone had that ability, would anything get done? and if everyone that had the ability lost it, then what is to stop the UN becoming more partisan than is appropriate?

It's not cognitive dissonance to believe that stripping this man of certain royal priviliges because he couldn't keep his fucking mouth shut but still be in support of the British Monarchy in its' current standing.

true,MatthewWilkes,eng-Bristol,Brizzle,"IANAL.

It's perfectly legal to record the inside of your own house, otherwise you couldn't use your phone to do it. When it comes to CCTV there are two problems, installation and consent.

Your contact with the landlord is between the group of tenants and the landlord. That's what the ""joint"" bit of ""joint and several"" is all about. Therefore, to ask your landlord for permission to install fixed cameras you need to do so as a group. One person on his own does not have the authority to speak for the entire group.

The second aspect is consent. Usually the way photography is prohibited in private spaces is through a condition on entry. That makes photographing anything trespass. That wouldn't really work in a domestic situation, but I see no reason that dismantling the system (as long as you give it back and don't damage it) would be a crime.

Finally, although a right to privacy is protected in the UK, breaching that right has not been shown to be sufficient for a legal dispute (sadface). The closest we have is ""breach of confidence"", which I believe would hold if the person recording tried to use the tapes in any way to his advantage, or show them to others.

Don't quote me on this, but I'd guess that in the case of a dispute like this you'd have to go on a majority rules thing, like a partnership would. I'd personally recommend speaking to your other housemates, agreeing you don't want him there, then approaching him and saying something like ""We've discussed the situation and believe that your request for surveillance has irreparably damaged our relationship. We think it's time you left"".

I've got 15 close friends and extended family now living much healthier lives because of e-cigs (quite a lot still use them but many went on to quit completely). 

Your post about people getting passively addicted to nicotine is ridiculous as well though. Vapour disperses incredibly quickly. Indoor tests show tiny amounts of trace nicotine within feet of source. And these were small enclosed environments with no ventilation. It doesn't linger like cigarette smoke. The idea that someone might get passively addicted is ludicrous to any rational person who understands biology and the nature of addiction. 

There are much stronger forces at play in this debate, and it's not about indoor air quality.

With the way we've been playing, it was only a matter of time before someone decided playing for a point was enough going to Anfield.

Also, the camera issue can be resolved in a breath if your landlord refuses him permission. At the moment you're trying to resolve the specific camera issue by running a marathon, when you could end it with a short sprint.

You might actually want to sit down with your other (reasonable) flatmates, write an objective and composed list of his unacceptable behaviours, and ask the landlord to give him notice.

Someone mentioned the castle isn't much to see, but they do also do a cave tour (you have to go into the castle building itself and book a ticket for that tour for a couple of quid more) which is worth it and also gets your entry to Brewhouse Yard afterwards - which will give you a look into Wartime England (ie, a house kitted out with various objects and such from what people used during that period).
Brewhouse Yard is right next door to the Olde Trip, which you're planning already - so could coincide nicely.

Galleries of Justice has been mentioned - I like it, and have been a few times already with visiting friends and family.

The caves in the broadmarsh are 'ok', although I'm not that hyped about them.

There's a ghost walk from The Sal(utation Inn) which I *think* is on Saturdays - unsure what time though - someone else can fill in the details if you're interested. It gives a good run down of some of the history of Nottingham and such.

I am not saying benefit cheating doesn't happen; I'm not saying it's not inherently wrong; I am not saying that, of the cases I know personally to be true, it doesn't infuriate me.

Of course, therein lies the rub, these shitty articles on the front page of the Metro emotionally engage the reader and get us up in arms, ""Arghh scummy neds and chavs stealing *my* tax pounds that *I've* earned when *I* have been out working all *my* life."" Companies owing incomprehensible amounts in tax do not inspire the same angst in the general public because of exactly that.. these figures are incomprehensible. It's much easier to get angered by the notion of a personified group of tax cheaters, often individually named in the papers, stealing from *our* money that *we've* paid in tax, rather than huge companies skimping tax in the realms of huge, unimaginable numbers. 

As for this article, and how suffering like this is ignored in view of publicising the likes of benefit cheat stats, I think the media is designed for a pretty apathetic and torch-and-pitchfork audience.

I have seen the hugely detrimental result of cutting disability allowance extended to relatively well-off families, but those who are genuinely poor and in ill health suffer dire consequences. I think this comment on the article summed it up reasonably well:

&gt;Not many comments on this thread, but I would like to say this. Through no fault of my own I broke my back in two places in 2011. I can't work and I have taken a huge hit with living standards, as it happened in my own home i have no one to sue and no one to help me. Now what I get is an existence, scrapping and saving by not having any living standard or lifestyle, no hobbies, no sky, I don't drink and I don't smoke, my day to day living is one of worry and concern. Thanks to the lib/lab/com pact I am sure things will only get worse. Three suicides in my street since 2011 and I am sure there will be more soon.

Nobody likes change and I believe vaping is a powerful tool in the transition from a smoker to a non-smoker and forcing vapers outside will destroy this one of many facets of a very viable and positive alternative to smoking and stopping smoking.

&gt; In a genuinely historic move, every trade union in the UK has signed up to a sustained general strike against austerity which could begin in the next few days Unite leader Len McCluskey has confirmed.

&gt; The shock announcement comes after months of secret meetings by union bosses in which agreement was reached to take decisive action to fight back against the demolition of the welfare state and NHS.  In a statement released early this morning McCluskey said:  âWe are tearing up the rule book.  Fuck the law, Iâll go to jail if I have to.  Itâs time to take a decisive stand and we call on everybody, in or out of work, to join  a sustained militant campaign  to support the strikes.â

&gt; Senior Tories have yet to comment on the move, but McCluskey is unrepentant.  Revealing his personal motivation for the strikes he explained: âI did not come into trade unionism to see everything that working class people have fought for over the years destroyed whilst we stand on the sidelines.  History will not forgive us if we do not act now.  We will not go back to work until a radical new settlement is reached or until the whole rotten neo-liberal charade comes crashing down.  Iâm proud to be part of this great initiative which will place trade unions right back where they should be â at the heart of working class struggle.â

Reina, Agger, Toure, Coates. Maybe Enrique but he's ok. Assaidi.

We then need:

First choice CB who can rival either Skrtel or Sakho. Full back, probably on the left to keep pushing Flanno, or so Flanno can push Johnson. 

Another CM to give us the depth we need for the CL. We need at least 5 CM's if we're playing 3 per game.

And another wide player/CAM to push Sterling and co. Maybe 2.

We keep Suso, Alberto, Ibe, Wisdom, Illori at the club not on loan. Borini also comes back.

Possible signings

- LB - Moreno or Rodriguez. Someone of their ilk. 
- CB - Howedes? Or maybe someone young and talented like Veltman from Ajax.
- CM - Kovacic from Inter, he's not getting games and has fallen out with the boss. Fits the club profile. 
- W/CAM - Konoplynaka or someone similar.

Just because the rider is the most likely to be killed, doesnt make the danger to others non existant. Also the lifelong effect on the driver whose bumper they fly over is worth noting.

It was important for us to recognise that we had dropped off a bit in the last couple of years and that if we were going to make real improvements, it would have to be done gradually and patiently. 

Compare FSG's approach before Rodgers and after Rodgers. In two transfer windows (January 2011 and Summer 2011) they spent A LOT and were hopeful that it would be enough to get Liverpool back into the Champions League under Kenny. After a poor season bar a couple of decent cup runs, they had to accept that Liverpool had fallen far from where their perch and that without the financial power of City or Chelsea things would have to be completely overhauled if we were going to make any progress. Come summer 2012, they fired Commolli, overhauled their approach to transfers and brought in a young and exciting manager to instill a new philosophy. 

What's mental is that the expectation from FSG was that Brendan would be given 3 years to implement his ideas and hopefully by then we'd be back in the Champions League. Who could have foreseen that we'd be where we are right now, hungry as ever, battling for the league title?

Proof? 

&gt; So when they give a small percentage of the money they are cutting to local councils to deal with the problem, it's obviously never going to be enough.

So why don't the councils use some of that Â£19Bn of reserves they're sat on? Why aren't they using the money that the government gave them specifically to deal with this very issue? Hell the government has even increased the DHP funding by Â£25m. [The total of DHP funding for 2014-2015 is Â£120m.](http://nationalhousingfederation.newsweaver.com/update/sn3aa6jvbd0)Where is it? Sat in the councils bank accounts accruing interest.

The truth of council funding is the government gave them the money they actually needed to operate at a time we needed to cut spending instead of giving them what they wanted with the difference getting banked. The fact that councils still managed to bank record amounts despite having their funding reduced speaks volumes about just how overfunded they've been for the last decade or more.

Now we are under Sherwood and the attack has been better but the defence has looked much less organized. In truth the entire squad has looked a lot less organized as a whole.

However this makes things a littke trickier tbh.

Not something you want some paranoid loon throwing your way. But ultimately you want to either remove himself or yourself from the picture. Recording without consent is legal in public places and private places with consent. But a flat isn't a public place so unless he is on a written lease he sould have no right to record anything in your communal areas.

Even that bit where he just wanders in and takes a photo of you then wanders away. You have to wonder what he's doing with that data, and in a place with no mentioned incidents of theft or intrusion or seems to me like he's more interested in being a creep. Just my opinion but sounds like he wants any available chance to get images of you and your flatmates.

West Ham will have a new essentially free stadium but their other revenue streams and lack of European football of any kind mean we're unlikely to be competing for the same players.

As for Spurs the money for a new stadium has to come from somewhere. While their ultimate owner is a very rich man he's shown no indications that he will be willingly to throw money at the club. Which suggests an approach more akin to Arsenals financing of the Emirates and similar financial constraints as Arsenal faced prior to the arrival of Ozil. Again Spurs lag behind us in terms of revenue generation and if we can reestablish a regular CL spot then the current trend of our transfer targets joining them should reverse.

As for the actual stadium debate it dates back at least 15 years to the late 90s/early 200s and was a key factor in David Moores selling the club in 2007 as he hoped to find a new owner who could personally finance a new stadium or Anfield redevelopment.",0,1396441484,null,0,false,0,cgi2vls,t3_22086d,t1_cgi2vls,t1_cgi2j4f,null,1433175236,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

Right?

Nope. I got nothing. Nothing at all. Not even interviews, doing this, I was unemployed for 6 months.

As soon as I gave up and went back to looking for work in architecture, I got a job within 6 weeks. I'm INCREDIBLY lucky in the fact that I LOVE working in architecture but HATE studying it.

In the first year you will cover a wide variety of subjects; from the website:

    The Business Environment.
    Business Resources.
    Introduction to Marketing.
    Business Communication.
    Business Accounting.
    Creative Product Promotion.
    Recruitment and Selection in Business.
    Understanding Retailing.
    Starting a Small Business.

And then in the second year of the course you'll pick a specialist subject like Finance or Marketing and focus more specifically on that subject. If you were to just go straight into accounting from the get go you will find that the qualification is so specific it will be very applicable to accounting jobs but not 'business-y type jobs' in general.

If you don't qualify straight onto the Level 3 Diploma (4 GCSE's at C or above) you can work your way up to it however long it takes; doing the Level 1, then the Level 2 or jumping in straight at the Level 2. It's all about finding a pathway that you can handle. If you aren't sure exactly what you want to do in the long run I think this will do you better than taking a specialist subject like jumping straight into accounting. Think about it!

Also, you said you are 15? At that age the course will be free for you. If it's your first Level 2 course? Free. First level 3 course? Free. Under 19? Free.

It's not that you can choose not to pay loans until you are comfortable. If you are employed, then loan payments will be automatically removed from your earnings by the PAYE (pay-as-you-earn) system, at the rate of 9% of every Â£1 earned over ~Â£17,000. If you're self-employed, a similar amount becomes due from your tax return calculation.

This is the default. If you earn less than the threshold, or are unemployed, you don't pay anything. If that continues for 30 years, the remaining debt is written off.  And the debt never grows more than 1% above inflation, so it never becomes significantly bigger in real terms over time.

You have to *choose* to pay back larger amounts, and as I said above, that's almost always a bad idea.

I vape myself, have done for the past 6 months.  It has been a miracle for me, I am mid 30's and was suffering with some chest pains before going to bed.  At times walking back from places, could find it hard to get my breath.  Since using them, I feel so much better.  My life has improved dramtically.  My sense of smell is back, my taste is better then ever also. I don't smell of tobacco anymore.  But, I still think that too many people are going to view vapers as getting through the back door to smoking indoors again.  Me personally, I wouldn't want to have anyone else breathing in my vape or smelling it.  

I have some lovely flavours, but they aren't going to be to everyones taste.  Not to mention that some people have allergies to things like PG and VG.  (The two main ingredients)

So, I think it's the decent respectful thing to do to go outside and vape.

Legislation has already taken away the right to smoke in public places and effectively pushed people out onto the streets.

The main reason this legislation was put in place was to protect staff and other members of the public from the damaging effects of second hand smoke. I can completely get behind that, and i'm sure a lot of smokers understand this point of view, as smoking in public places is completely different to smoking in the comfort of your own home.

But what I do not understand is how water vapour from E-cigarettes poses the same risk. I believe it is absolute bullshit that they are considering banning them. They pose no risk to other people (None at all), they pose a significantly reduced risk for the user compared to real cigarettes, and furthermore they encourage people to give up real cigarettes.

The argument that it psychologically makes smoking more acceptable is bollocks, because it's not the act of smoking that is the problem, it is the effects of the chemicals on peoples health and wellbeing. If you eliminate that risk as E-cigarettes have, then they should be considered ok.

Today, they have gone digital just like terrestrial TV and the entire point of the DOCSIS standard is to shove data through the network using the space that one or more TV channels would take. 

So, if they have some free channels they might be able to use them for more DOCSIS channels and thus more capacity. This isn't necessarily easy or cheap, it means having to buy more of the expensive headend equipment and making sure it won't affect anything. 

If they don't, they might have to get drastic and physically split the areas served by the nodes into smaller ones. Each node has a separate set of DOCSIS channels, so usage on one shouldn't affect the others. 

It's not terribly easy and no matter what they do, it is easy for demand to exceed capacity. BT meanwhile has the distance issue but the cabinets and exchanges can have gigabits of bandwidth to connect them to the rest of the network.

Tell them that you have ongoing issues with your housemate, who is prone to acting strangely and you are worried may not be in his right mind. Describe what has been happening and that you are planning to confront him about it (via telling your landlord about the CCTV thing, or talking to him yourself.) 

Whilst the Police initially cannot do anything about this as they'll probably call it a civil dispute, tell them you just wanted to log all of this information with them incase things kick off. They will give you a reference number, and if there ever is a breach of peace situation, it means the officers who attend will be informed about what you have reported before. Even if you're not looking for a police intervention, its good to build up a paper trail, as others have said - and if Police ever are called out, they work pretty closely with mental health services.

Whilst true, the difference is that the lines between evasion and avoidance are greyer to the point where a bunch of lawyers turn up in court and argue over the finer details and often still don't agree - there definitely is a big line between benefit fraud and undeserving claimants.  Plus the barrier to tax avoidance is high enough that it means that unless you are wealthy it isn't worthwhile doing, whereas most people who try to claim benefits but don't deserve them are usually shooting themselves in the foot (who really thinks having to look after a fifth child is worth the extra Â£13.40 per week and a slightly larger house if they can find you one).",0,1396445812,null,0,false,0,cgi43gc,t3_21zxma,t1_cgi43gc,t1_cgi3s64,null,1433175805,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Reina was never going there to be a backup anyway. He's already playing hardball with Napoli over their contract offer. I expect them to work out an agreement.

It looks like Ter Stegen may have already signed for Barca on the quiet. Not sure whether this ban will mea the deal falls through or of it os allowed to stand.

It is clear to the Board of Chelsea Football Club that a complete new build of a 60,000 seat stadium at Stamford Bridge has little chance of acceptability. We believe that, after our discussions with the council they have come to the same conclusion. A 60,000 new-build would cost over Â£600 million and require the club to play away for at least three seasons and, even if the economics were acceptable, the planning risks would likely be insurmountable.

Expanding Stamford Bridge to 55,000 also has a number of challenges. The cost per seat of expanding the stands is very high. The incremental revenues provide an unsatisfactory level of return, would not even cover the hypothetical financing costs, and the planning risks are significant. We believe the council recognises these challenges.

The club's exercise over the years has been to analyse a large spectrum of possible expansion options, even some which would appear to be unworkable. The Board recognises that our work will not satisfy every fan, but the Board also believes its work has been thorough, appropriate and in the best interests of the club and all of our fans.

To reiterate what was said at the beginning of this summary, the club are not in any way stating we have made a decision on the need to move.

Depending on their income/State Pension/employment status, your grandfather could claim Pension Credit with Carer Addition which is similar to Carer's Allowance. The rules are fairly complicated, and you could seek advice from your local Citizen's Advice Bureau or the [Carers UK Adviceline](http://www.carersuk.org/about-us/contact-us). More info about Pension Credit with Carer Addition [here](http://www.carersuk.org/help-and-advice/help-with-money/benefits-a-tax-credits/carer-benefits-for-pensioners).

Finally if your grandfather receives State Pension or any workplace pension, he could have that money paid into his own bank account. Obviously this would mean he would have to take some control of finances from your grandmother, but as the State Pension recipient he can ask to have it paid to wherever he likes.

Age UK may also be able to offer advice on benefits and pensions, but it seems like your grandparents have a wider problem than just money.

FCB are currently appealing the ban, in an effort to reconcile any issues with child trafficking errrrr, 'the transfer of international minors', and I am optimistic that we will likely have our summer 2014 ban postponed while we appeal, and the appeal will be reduced to the winter 2014 window, and a right slap on the wrist for us. We may end up giving up on nearly 10 players in our youth system, but that is what most of our punishment will consist of. So, have faith(?), we are still likely going to purchase Jan.

On a side note, I just want to clarify that Rule 19 seems kind of ridiculous because from what I understand it only applies to countries (like Spain) that have a federal law on the movement of minors for job seeking purposes.

Did you watch Chelsea in the 2012 season? What else would you call ""merit"" when he had the most PL goals in the team? (tied for first with Lampard, and more than double the goals Torres had) Do you see how wrong you are now? If not then you're not forming opinions based on what happens in front of you. Do you think Sturridge is better than Torres now? Do you think this miraculously came out of nowhere the minute he left Chelsea? It must take a lot of work for you to come up with BS that explains your erroneous logic. He was always this good, and he was better than Torres by miles at Chelsea.

true,Shamyrock,IE,ireland,"I'm searching the premier league handbook but can't even find anything about the two year rule. Does anybody know if its a different association that imposed that rule?

Edit: Is the maximum years at a club on loan 100% a rule?

Edit: Think I found it!

&gt; Where the player is extending his employment with the same club 
If a club wishes to retain the services of a player, they should submit a new application before 
the work permit or Certificate of Sponsorship expires. If the criteria are satisfied, an endorsement 
will be issued for the period of their contract, up to a maximum of three years. 

I have no qualifications in law or anything but this is my interpretation of it. In the premier league handbook loans are called ""temporary transfers"". Which basically means returning to a club on loan is extending that temporary contract which as it states can only be done for up to 3 years. Now while obviously its Atletico's temporary contract not ours, I assume the Spanish FA has a similar rule. Which basically means the problem is on their end, not ours. I don't know if they can offer a different contract to keep him there though instead of extending. We can't do anything about it though so an extension for us won't change the loan I don't think.

The smoking ban exists to help protect people from the (possible) dangers of second hand smoke. These devices do not have that danger. Ergo, the smoking ban is totally fucking meaningless.

The EasyBus goes to Baker Street though, which is really close on the tube to Wembley Park; that makes travelling to the stadium easier but won't save on fares.

I made a point in response to your laughable claim that Lennon's poor performance was down to tactics. I pointed out that when a winger who is actually good came on the pitch he did more than Lennon has done since the United game. Thus disproving your laughable claim.

I then went on to claim in a seperate point that Lennon is possibly the worst starting player in the PL - and is certainly the worst starting winger in the PL.

Vaping provides an easy way to ditch a highly addictive, destructive habit which lots of you have been battling with for years. Isn't it enough that you can now get your health back without withdrawal symptoms?

You really need the added incentive of being able to do it indoors? It may be a lot better than tobacco, but do we really know it has no effect on other people? Someone who spends 20 years working 40 hours a week in a bar where everybody is vaping will suffer no ill effects over time? We don't know.

As for tax, that will come. The government make too much from tobacco to lose it. If they can tax some dried leaves, they can tax the new fangled fluid that replaces them. The tax might be a little lower, since vaping will probably not directly cost the NHS as much. Or it might just stay the same, because people are already prepared to pay it.

And it will get regulated. The tobacco industry aren't about to walk away and start making healthy fruit smoothies instead. They are going to push for regulation, complex regulation that only a multi-national has the resources to comply with. Unregulated materials will become class C drugs.

true,Thetonn,eng-sussex,Sussex,"First off, the case for leaving the EU is largely a principled rather than utilitarian one. Most advocating leaving the EU support it irrespective of the economic benefits due to their commitment to soverignty and democracy. Granted, these are highly questionable and easily debateable, but they stand irrespective of whether a bunch of rich industrialists say it would be the right thing or not.

Secondly, industry tends to favour the status quo unless there is direct evidence that something would benefit them. Stability, planning and trade are good for them and in their interests and are more obvious and apparent than the alternatives. Considering the uncertainty and hassle that leaving the EU would have, it is more than reasonable that even if the economic costs were non-existent or negligable, they would choose to stay.

Finally there is a basic opportunity cost thing here. The argument of eurosceptics is not that there is no benefit to the EU. That would be moronic. Of course if the EU spends Â£100 million on research and development that is a good thing. But that Â£100 million comes from taxes and contributions made by us. The EU is just allocating money. British governments could do so if they wished, the question would be whether or not they should do.

So, yeah. A technocratic, unaccountable body focusing on promoting economic growth and prosperity is supported by business.

true,WarDamnSpurs,num1,,"&gt; I made a point in response to your laughable claim that Lennon's poor performance was down to tactics. I pointed out that when a winger who is actually good came on the pitch he did more than Lennon has done since the United game.

Townsend came on when the match was already over. Liverpool knew they could sit back and wait for a dumb decision. It's pretty obvious that Spurs have lacked in regards to tactics this season. Telling Lennon to 'just go run around a bit' is not going to work for him. Give him a system in which he can make quality short passes (i.e. LvG), and we could see him regain his form.

&gt;I then went on to claim in a separate point that Lennon is possibly the worst starting player in the PL - and is certainly the worst starting winger in the PL. Can you name one starting winger worse than him?

Damien Duff and/or Jonathan Walters.

&gt; Oh and btw what on earth were you trying to claim with your inane comment with regards pass completion stats earlier on??

Pass completion percentage is one of the most important stats for a midfielder or winger. If Lennon is the worst winger in the premier league, then Townsend isn't far behind him.

Can you find me some statistics to support your claim that Lennon is the worst starting winger in the league? I'd love to see them.

If your disability wouldn't cause you problems if you were kicked out of your home then that's good for you. I know people with disabilities that would mean moving to a smaller property or moving in general would be huge problem, including someone who does live in a council house (Fortunately they live with a pensioner, and are therefore exempt from the bedroom tax thanks to the bizarre exemption for pensioners which only makes sense if you consider the Tories are worried about losing pensioners votes).

&gt;The councils don't need to run a deficit to make up the difference because they're still increasing their reserves which suggests that they have excess money does it not?

You can't tell from an aggregate figure across all councils including all incomes and expenditures whether or not individual councils are running a deficit or whether they're passing the money from central government onto disabled people. [The poorest councils have suffered the worst cuts](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jan/30/local-government-cuts-poorest-areas) and are also the most likely areas to have more people in social housing. It could be the wealthy councils that are adding their reserves, while the poorest ones are already running a deficit. Without a breakdown of the income and expenditure of individual councils we don't know, the aggregate figures tell us very little. Anyway the fact remains that money they got from the government for that cause was less than the amount the government cut in the first place, so some people will obviously suffer.

&gt;You don't put money in the bank if you don't have enough to pay the bills.

It does make sense for the councils to try and save some money. We've still got years of damaging cuts ahead as the deficit has only been cut by a third so far. They're almost certainty going to be asked to do more with less in the future. If you know your bills are going to rise and your income is going to fall, it makes sense to save what you can before things get even worse. Any money they spend is money they won't be able to spend in the future, so they'd just be putting off the problem and leaving themselves in a worse position, in which case you'd probably criticise them for their lack of financial discipline.",0,1396454827,null,0,false,0,cgi7ucr,t3_21zzty,t1_cgi7ucr,t1_cgi32mx,null,1433177571,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Townsend came on when the match was already over. Liverpool knew they could sit back and wait for a dumb decision.

Liverpool did this for almost all of the game. A more proactive game plan from Liverpool would have suited Lennon more anyway so this is just a dumb point.

&gt; Telling Lennon to 'just go run around a bit' is not going to work for him.

Why shouldnt it work for him? He played fine under Redknapp.
And what tactics are you thinking of that would make him play better?

&gt; Give him a system in which he can make quality short passes (i.e. LvG), and we could see him regain his form.

Are you honestly trying to claim that Lennon would thrive in a possesion based system? Thats not his game. He is a direct player who suits a direct system like Sherwoods. The fact that he is playing so poorly in this system indicates how rapidly he has declined.


Damien Duff doesnt start for Fulham and he is better than Lennon anyway. Jonathan Walters is also better than Lennon. He has four times as many goals and twice as many assists.

&gt; Pass completion percentage is one of the most important stats for a midfielder or winger

No it isnt. That is actually one of the dumbest things Ive heard someone say on hear. Its almost completely irrelevant when it comes to wingers. Gareth Bales pass accuracy is 76%. Ronaldo's pass accuracy is 80%. Arjen Robbens pass accuracy is 82%, Ribery's is 84.4%.

&gt; Can you find me some statistics to support your claim that Lennon is the worst starting winger in the league?

His goals and assists statistics are the worst for any starting winger in the PL as far as i am aware. His dribbling statistics (supposdly his strong point - lol) are near the worst. Week in, week out he is the player with the least touches of the ball showing how little he gets involved in play.

A detailed study by Belgian consultancy Transport &amp; Mobility Leuven has found that a slight shift in traffic composition from cars to motorcycles significantly reduces traffic congestion and emissions.

&gt;A model change of 10% more motorcycles meant 40% less congestion - a modal shift of 25% me...Traffic intensity versus speed, from the detailed study by Belgian consultancy Transport &amp;...Motorcycle rich traffic flows carry far higher numbers of passengers
The study, which was presented at the Association des Constructeurs EuropÃ©ens de Motocycles (ACEM) 2012 Conference in Brussels, found that if 10 percent of all private cars were replaced by motorcycles in the traffic flow of the test area, total time losses for all vehicles decreased by 40 percent and total emissions reduced by 6 percent (1 percent from the different traffic composition of more emission-reduced motorcycles and 5 percent from avoided traffic congestion). A 25 percent modal shift from cars to motorcycles was found to eliminate congestion entirely.

You should thank me for riding a bike and filtering between traffic.  ;)",0,1396456483,null,0,1396456722,0,cgi8mng,t3_21zzoi,t1_cgi8mng,t1_cgi1fp1,null,1433177940,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

- How the squad cope with midweek games on a regular basis. I know you said without incoming players, but to compete in both the PL and the CL we are going to need a bigger squad with more quality in depth. 

- How Rodgers handles the CL. It's a new experience to him as well and whilst I have been very impressed with his tactical expertise, it's still a new competition he will have to adapt to and learn from!

- What kind of group we get. If the draw is nice, awesome. If the draw is bad due to our seeding, which from memory puts us in pot 3 possibly(?), we could end up with a couple of heavyweights. Whilst that is great for experience, it has shown with Man City that it can also cause early exits.

Honestly, if we get out of the group, I believe we can challenge most teams on our day. Sure, there are better teams out there currently such as Bayern and Real Madrid.

It does hurt, every team that is in the EL (apart from CL drop outs or CL teams having a bad year and not making it) is hurt by the EL. The difference is the massive amount of cash CL teams get to get a bigger squad with better players.

[The US has already stated that the UK will be excluded from trade deals that the US works out with Eu if it leaves and it will not negotiate separate ones with the UK.](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/27/eu-exit-risks-us-trade-deal) and it makes sense for them too, the UK really is worthless to the US without the EU outside of speaking the same language. The EU market is far larger and more lucrative for US businesses. 

Not to mention that countries like Norway still have to pay into EU programs in return for trade agreements, its not like the EU just lets them trade for nothing. Its just that Norway has 0 say in how their money is spent and none of it ever goes to Norway. They also have to obey EU laws as well. So much for 'we want independence from the EU'
 
And on top of that you have the added problem that if the UK left the EU than Scotland will definitely pull out of the UK and go for independence and join the EU. They've already made clear that they wish to join after leaving anyway, this would only cement that fact.


People who push hard for the UK leaving the EU are stuck in the past, we don't have an empire to support us anymore. ",0,1396458604,null,0,false,0,cgi9o17,t3_220b5s,t1_cgi9o17,t1_cgi94ev,null,1433178430,19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,19

The last 2 times Rooney has played primarily as the lone striker for a whole season (disregarding this season while RVP's been injured), he's scored 26 and 27 league goals with 32 and 35 in all comps for each respective season. It's obviously not Suarez level but it's pretty damn good. Since then we've have Berbatov and RVP who have each shifted him out of position. But I agree with the general consensus around here.

A small fine?

http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/220pgv/im_from_microsoft_and_your_computer_is_infected/cgia1hs

&gt; 5,000 fine + 5,665 compensation + 13,929 prosecution costs = 24,594 total legal fees

&gt;The article says he charged $35-$150 for the scam service. Assuming the differently priced services were distributed evenly, the average cost for this service comes to 92.50.

&gt;24,594/92.50= 265.9 people scammed before he breaks even on his legal fees

&gt;For scaling purposes, let's say he scammed 1,000 people before he was caught. 92.50 x 1,000= 92,500

&gt;Edit: forgot one detail: 92,500-24,594= 67,906 left to pay normal salaries and bills

&gt;I did this math to point out that this is not a warning to other scammers with similar gameplans. If anything, this tells the scammers that their behavior will be met with minimal legal fees even if they are caught. The next step for the scammers is simply to include this as part of their operational costs.

Are you in the cabinet or just hoping to get in one day? 

The discretionary fund is not enough to cover the benefits cuts. In addition, it is pretty stressful for someone to have to constantly apply for Discretionary Payments. It would obviously be a lot better if they just received the benefits they were entitled to in the first place... Or is that too simple a solution for you? Why add an extra layer of bureaucracy for the poorest people in society to deal with? You expose them to an extra potential hurdle, and as the fund is discretionary they are at the mercy of the employee who deals with the form. I thought right wingers wanted to cut red tape?

Of course there are some councils (especially Labour) who are shite and trying to capitalize on the cuts, but it's the Tories that hold the cards, they're the ones in power. If they care about vulnerable people, why not fix the benefits system? If not then why not? So they can lay the blame on the councils?

Uhh, let's look back at our discussion, using direct quotes:

You: Adults in the real world, not fairy-guardian land, have to contend with the fact that if the system is not fixed, then we will be looking at the poor and disabled actually being totally fucked with no welfare whatsoever.

Me: Going to have to elaborate on that last bit buddy. How are these ""fixes"" the only way we can save welfare as we know it?

You: **These fixes are the only way we can save the welfare state as we know it** because the deficit was growing at an astonishing speed ( and it is still growing quite quickly even now).

true,CompleteNumpty,null,null,"I used to work for the Home Office deportations department many years ago, so I can give you my take on it based on roughly 6 months of dealing with stuff like this.

There is some conflicting information out there, some sources say she came over in 2011 with her family, or that her mother came over in 2009.  If her mother came over in 2009 then the argument that the family came over due to danger doesn't really stand up, as if it was dangerous why did she stay by herself?

The family originally had visitor's visas, then applied for asylum when they expired - if they had applied as soon as they arrived then the case would have been seen more favourably, as the Home Office takes the opinion that people who apply for asylum when their visa runs out are trying to game the system.  The importance of how the staff view the family cannot be overstated - if they think you are genuine then they will do their best to help you, (even granting asylum in a single day) but if they think that you are taking the piss then they will do everything they can to get you out.

As they waited she was over 18 when the application was made, so her claim was processed separately and a single person is easier to deport than someone with young children - which is why she is going before her mother and younger sibling(s).

Lastly, a single abusive relative isn't considered grounds for asylum - the Home Office's stance is that they should be sent back home, but to a different city.  They will even provide a grant for setting up a business etc. so that they aren't being dumped with nothing.

This isn't a perfect answer, as I wasn't a caseworker (thankfully) - I just prepared court documents for them.  The asylum system in the UK is a joke at times, such as in 2008 they would refuse to grant asylum to Zimbabweans, but would also refuse to deport them as it was considered too dangerous to go home.

You cannot go into a shop and buy it in bulk, unless you are going to go into multiple shops and buy multiple packets, which is a whole different problem than just popping painkillers, and those kind of people will find some way to get their high. 

Though I do agree about the drunk/high thing, but just like alcohol, it should be up to the shop to restrict the sale in these conditions.

Whilst it is easy to say 'have some in the house as back up' it's not always that easy.  What if the packet you have is out of date by the time you need it, and then you have to wait for an appointment just for painkillers?  Not everyone will be running to check pills every so often, and not everyone needs it all the time.

The point of painkillers is for quick and easy relief when the pain is bad, to restrict them, like other drugs, does no favours except for the people that are apparently overdosing on them, who will find something else to go for if this happened.

&gt;Let's put 100 non-smokers in a room with people who use these and see how many get addicted to nicotine, something these e-fags **do** contain. If it's just one person they should ban every e-fag ever.


So? Nicotine isn't inherently dangerous, it's danger comes from the fact that to consume it you have to ingest a fuck load of carcinogens. 

If you get addicted to nicotine via second hand vapour it won't force you to start smoking - your brain develops the connection through the method of consumption.

This actually used to exist.

If you came off disability benefit and went into work, but within a year or so you found that your health had deteriorated or your health problems just made working not a viable option, you could return to benefits at your previous rates without having to go through all the tests etc.

The present govt removed this option pretty much as soon as they came into power.

This is on of the reasons someone on disability benefit is possibly more hesitant to try working and see if they are capable of it.  If they get a job but it turns out that working is detrimental to their health or they just can't manage it as well as they thought they could, then they need to apply for benefits as a new claim.

With the exception of streaming media (where terminology reflects the country you live in), and BBC America's website (which is geared towards, you guessed it, Americans), every other official source states these new Doctor Who episodes as *series* and not seasons. The cast and production crew both refer to the new episodes as being a ""series"", and references to the classic episodes are talked about as ""seasons"". Hell, even in America on the DVD cases it is written as ""Series 6"" and **not** ""Season 6"".

Truthfully though, I understand people mixing them up (I'm American, and yes, it took a bit to get used to), but it can be frustrating for some because maybe they'd like to talk about the classic series, which sadly doesn't happen too often. It would be the same as if someone posted saying ""I just finished season six, *The War Games* is amazing!"" (which it is), and fans of *only* the new show getting frustrated because that's not the ""season"" six they're familiar with.

This is a subreddit dedicated to *ALL* of Doctor Who, **not** just the new series, whether you are initiated with the classic show or not. Disregarding specificities makes things more difficult in discussing a show that has been around for 50 years, which is much longer than a lot of it's fans have been around, I'm sure.

Nick Clegg does his best school prefect impression, and Nigel Farage his 'slight drunk accountant from down the pub that talks for goes on just long enough to make you uncomfortable'. Success mostly comes down (as it did in the 2010 debate) to debating style. If you have any more than a passing interest in the subject, you will have heard all of the talking points made before a hundred times. Debaters never concede nuance or uncertainty in their position, and will shift any question onto familiar ground to attack their opposition most effectively. They really are little more than theatre, and not very good theatre at that. I feel the same way about Question Time - every question is some well-trod issue from the week, and every participant gets their chance to parrot the very well-established party line, then the show moves on to the next topic. It produces far more heat than light. I think, if they do happen, they should be more focused, much longer, and strictly moderated, so that there's at least some chance you might hear something original.

Nick Clegg is saying business doesn't want to be out (although Farage pulled the 62% number of car makers for serious reform), Farage is saying the people should be able to chose their own destiny. I'm inclined to go with the people and what they want over business interests because that's what democracy is about. Business is not going to collapse and people aren't going to pull out of markets because we aren't a part of the political union. Agreements on those things whether we're in or out is mutually beneficial. Deals will be done regardless because money is the master. Will it be more difficult to strike deals? I think maybe but if people think they're going to lose out, they will make sure deals are struck.

I realise that it will create difficulties but it comes down to the fact that *we* will be able to chose the best deals and trade by people *we* elected. Farage's argument hasn't been stated to be a complete pull out only that we resign from the political oversight and make it our own again.

A guide to one of my [favourite films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_People_%281942_film%29) by one of my favourite critics. If you've never seen Cat People and you enjoy horror or psychological thrillers then you should definitely check it out. It features a very daring psychosexual subtext for a film from 1942. The sequel, [The Curse of the Cat People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Curse_of_the_Cat_People) is also well worth watching, drawing upon the power of a child's imagination in an almost Disney-meets-the-Brothers-Grimm way.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Pep's possession football just isn't a winning strategy against teams that defend in numbers and attack on the counter.

That is why he has only lost 14 games in the last 5 years right? He went to Old Trafford, completely dominated a team that has been one of the worlds best in the last decade, and got a point away from home and you are criticizing him? We went to against the exact same team earlier in the season and couldn't dominate them and ended up going scoreless, is that better?

&gt; Anyone who watched the United game knows that Bayern were lucky not to lose 3 - 1.

Complete ignorance. That was far *far* from the case. Anyone who actually understands football can tell you that was far from the case. The whole point of a counter attack is you have to be lethal when you get your opportunities, which they were not, so you can't make up goals that didn't happen. Bayern were in the driver seat the entire game, and if a goal was to come, it was always going to most likely be from them.

&gt; Possession will not win anything against a disciplined team, as we have seen over the past 10 years in the Champions League.

Again, its like you are clueless. Barcelona has won 3 out of the last 8 Champions league titles... Have you not been watching football for that long or something? That exact style has been what won them all those trophies. Real Madrid for the last couple seasons has been playing counter attack, guess what, they haven't won a champions league in years.

Mourinho's Real Madrid was the most expensive team assembled and they almost always played on the counter vs barca, you want to know his record against Pep's Barcelona? 

3 wins, 5 draws, **7** losses.

true,mejogid,cnty-uk,London,"&gt; Most advocating leaving the EU support it irrespective of the economic benefits due to their commitment to soverignty and democracy.

I'm really not so sure. A lot of arguments are about things like bureaucracy (""red tape"") and immigration (""bloody foreigners""). People may mention sovereignty, but I think that's more of a talking point than a real motive.

&gt;  Considering the uncertainty and hassle that leaving the EU would have, it is more than reasonable that even if the economic costs were non-existent or negligable

If there's a lot of uncertainty and adjustments, then that's a huge detriment to industry. You'll have certain industries shrinking dramatically, lots of people needing retraining, and much more. There's no way that leaving would be anything other than very costly in the short term.

&gt; The EU is just allocating money. British governments could do so if they wished

No, not really. Centralised funds and redistribution of resources are proportionally a very small part of the EU's purpose.

The [TD SIPP](http://www.tddirectinvesting.co.uk/choose-an-account/sipp/retirement/) doesn't mention small pots on their retirement options page. They can also hold contributions as cash.

true,JohnPeel,null,null,"I strongly believe that reform is not possible. The system itself would prevent this. The chain in accountability goes something like this:

The European council is formed from the elected heads of state of EU countries. These countries decide who the EU commission president is going to be. The parliament may either accept or reject the candidate. They may not select the candidate and do not get to vote on the candidate. Only the EU council may do this. The EU council must elect the candidate with a qualified majority of 50% from the EU parliament. This presents a problem in that the council can simply keep putting forward candidates who are rejected up until the point that parliament gets fed up. This is faux democracy, no citizen gets to vote on it and the elected parliament members may only select from a list of appointed candidates. It is a fair election in the Soviet sense, you may choose your Communist party official but you're not allowed to choose a capitalist.

Now, the commissioner has been elected. Great. He may now select some appointees for the commission from a list prepared by council member states. Again the parliament may choose to approve his selection but they cannot have their own candidates unless the council graciously selects them for their list. In practice they have not been selecting candidates from parliament. Again this leads to the situation where you're given a Sophie's choice of candidates.

So now we have our commission sorted. They get to write the laws and then put them to parliament to either pass or reject. Parliament may put forward suggestions for change but the commission does not have to abide by them. This is important because if the commission never drafts a reform bill, then it cannot be voted on and parliament has no say over the content of bills.

It took 20 years for the EU parliament to even get a partial say. It has not gained increased power in practice since the original vote in around 1993. I'm far from convinced we're ever going to see a fully elected EU parliament for another 20 years still (if the EU survives that long) because that would not be in the best interests of the majority of EU council members.

true,davewi11o,null,null,"Hey guys, just logged on for my usual browse of Reddit and spotted my name, which is kinda surreal! Thought I'd take the opportunity to clear things up as I know some people arent quite sure of my background.

The project started out last year as a personal hobby, Im a graphic designer by trade, and at that point I worked full time at a design studio (designing a lot of stuff for fulham fc ironically). I designed Postcard No1 a few days after the Stoke game because it was such a nerve racking game, but Id just seen a set of posters online based on Breaking Bad, where an artist had designed one poster for every episode of the show. I thought this would work well when applied to football, and as Liverpool was my club, that seemed the best place to start!

In the beginning, I had no intention to sell them, I wanted to design them and post them online, with the idea of getting some exposure for my work, which in turn would hopefully attract some freelance work and get my name ""out there"".

I was blown away with the reaction, and as Liverpool's season went from strength to strength, so did the series. People started asking for them, so I got a small number printed and went from there. I had no connections to the club at all, but after the 5th or 6th postcard, a member of their social media team got in touch and asked if I would be interested in letting them upload them to their facebook page, so obviously I said yes! From there, the series was featured in the official LFC magazine, and the Anfield Wrap online mag, all of which just came about through word of mouth on twitter and facebook.

Postcard No10 was the first time one of my designs was noticed by a big audience. The tube design was really popular on facebook, but somebody reported it to Transport for London, who own the rights to the map. Their licensing team got in touch to say that my design was to similar to their 150 years of the FA poster, which you can see here... http://shop.tfl.gov.uk/design-collections/maps/product/the-football-association-150th-anniversary-tube-map-framed-white.html

I had genuinely not seen that poster, and it was a fair claim (so their issue was with the fact it was too similar to one of their licensed products, not the fact that it was a tube map so much) and to be honest, they were really understanding. I explained people were collecting the cards, so they let me keep selling them until the end of the month, then I had to change the design.

Fast forward to the start of Feb this year, the postcards were doing well, I had managed to keep to my promise of doing a new one every match and they were getting a good response online (most of the time). Then LFC got in touch in an official capacity to say that they loved the series and that they were interested in making them official. So while negotiations took place, I took the cards offline for a short time. Thankfully everything was sorted out 2 weeks ago, so the cards returned, the LFC Facebook team resumed their weekly posts and today (out of the blue) the website team decided to write a story on the series.

So in terms of logistics, nothing has changed. I still design, print, pack and post all of the orders.

For instance, he was careful to say that world trade talks mean that there aren't all that many tariffs on global trade in manufactured goods. But Britain's exports are principally not in manufactured goods, but services, and [attempts at a global deal on trade in services have been going on for 15 years, and are utterly stalled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha_Development_Round). Also, he said that Iceland has a free trade deal with China, but saying a deal has been signed does nothing to address the content of the deal. For instance, in the current trade deal with the US, America wants Europe to import American food, and trust their food standards regulation. So American meat farmers would be able to continually medicate their cattle with anti-biotics (which is banned in the EU), and thereby undercut British and European farmers. The greater the divergence in power, the greater the ability to push these sorts of clauses into any deal. And it's not like China has not been very aggressive in putting terms on access to its market - global companies are forced to create local subsidiaries and transfer huge amounts of technology in order to import goods.

Also, there's a great difference in the politics of an Iceland-China deal than a UK-China deal, and the same applies to India. Iceland is a small, neutral, harmless country with no historical baggage, Britain is a former global superpower, who ruled over India, and exerted huge power in China, in the process doing some pretty unpleasant things. We may not know much about the Opium Wars, but try asking a Chinese person about it.

true,eldudovic,lfc55,,"I think it depends. We obviously have a great team. We play the greatest football in England. Now how much does that actually tell us? England have been hit or miss in Europe lately. 

Now, I am of the belief that the lack of european success for Manchester City, Arsenal and, to a certain extent, Chelsea (I know they won the cup two years ago but bear with me) has been because they don't have an identity. There is no City way or Chelsea way. There is an Arsenal way but they haven't been able to play their way for years now, mostly because they can never keep their players. United have had their way of playing, their identity, but the last few years they've mostly relied on grit and determination.

Chelsea and City have had league success because of the pure fact that their quality of players have been higher than their opposition. Their playstyle have been nothing special. They've played standard football. They've not had that same solid foundation to fall back on when their quality fails them, namely against quality opposition in Europe. If you look at Bayern, Barcelona and Dortmund there's a certain style of play that you associate them with.

Now where does that leave Liverpool? I think that Brendan Rodgers have instilled a solid foundation. How we should play and every single player knows their role on the pitch. I also think he's instilled the mentality that we're a great club and when we go to play, we play the way we want. We want the opposition to adapt to us rather than us to adapt to them. I think we might do well in the Champions League IF our players go in to games with the same mentality we've had in the league. We need to keep our core group of players. Of course we might crash and burn and our players might just not be good enough, but I'm carefully optimistic.

This is of course just pure speculation, but I think this is a theme that's been prominent in the champions league the last few years.

We managed to negate some of the worst excesses by altering the quantity of our currency but then Germany returned to growth way before we did despite being an EZ member along with many other EZ countries. There's a correlation between the EZ and economic crisis, but not a necessary link. Iceland and the Balkan states went through hell despite not being EZ members (they're not even EU members). 

The EZ will outdo us in the long term and prove Nick Clegg and the car industry right. ",1,1396473629,null,0,false,0,cgihdpv,t3_220b5s,t1_cgihdpv,t1_cgid2sb,null,1433182140,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

If they are in such a way that they get confused over drug use, then perhaps they should be the ones being prescribed from their doctor, and having their drugs set out in such a way that they can take them in a safe manner.

Say we put a tariff on Chinese textiles, the British people will buy less of them and we pay a higher price. This will then be met aggressively by China, as we are restricting their exports. They may restrict the amount of rare earth metals they supply which will affect our technology industry, meaning we lose jobs as well as the technology company's price being higher. This then spirals, causing a loss of jobs and higher prices.

The Guardian's economics team did not draw that conclusion last year when doing a what-if scenario: http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2013/jun/02/britain-euro-what-if-joined
&gt; As in Spain and Ireland, a spectacular bubble developed in the housing market, fuelled by excessively low lending rates, an ""anything goes"" mentality among lenders and lax regulation. Even outside the euro, the UK had quite a boom going in the housing market in the mid-2000s. Inside, it would have been like the wild west.

&gt; When the crash came in 2007 it was a spectacular one. The financial markets imploded, the banks stopped lending and cheap credit dried up. The housing market collapsed, unemployment rose, tax receipts shrivelled and the government's budget deficit went through the roof.

Nor did the Telegraph's assistant editor: http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/finance/jeremywarner/100024801/what-if-britain-had-joined-the-euro/

&gt; The immediate effect would have been to turbo charge the latter stages of Britain's already out of control credit boom. There would then have followed an even bigger banking bust than the one we had, followed by a Baltics style economic contraction.

&gt; The upshot would have been an even more terrifying deterioration in the public finances than the one that occurred, combined with sky high interest rates to reflect default risk on UK sovereign debt. Like the debt colonies of the eurozone periphery, pretty soon we would have been in deflation and depression, with little or no help from monetary policy to ease the pain.

Because then your country isn't under your control.

&gt; Parliamentary Sovereignty still stands because the Parliament has the authority to leave the EU.

This is an interesting debate. Parliament is legally only bound by its own will to be bound. But in practice Parliament cannot make certain decisions without being heavily penalised. So I would say that by being in the EU, Parliament is sovereign in a legal sense but in a practical sense is no longer independent. The limits placed on Parliament go much further than issues relating to the common market, too, so I cannot see this as anything less than an attempt to create a federal European state by stealth.

&gt;Why not? States are the highest form of tribe, and nationalism and patriotism are the highest form of devotion to it. Tribalism isn't one of humanity's more noble characteristics.

Tribalism keeps people happy. Multiculturalism always leads to smaller groups feeling oppressed by the larger groups.

&gt;The current Crimean crisis is basically accelerating the federalisation and unified militarisation of Europe at a pretty alarming rate. Especially former eastern European countries are really gunning for it now. It's amazing how a well engineered crisis can acheive long term ambitions in such a short amount of time eh?

In what way is this true? All military precautions in Eastern Europe are being dealt with through *NATO* and the forces are being supplied more by the USA than Western EU states. 

The Crimea crisis has been going on for several months and no notable moves by the European Union to federalise in that time have occured (not that they would, because a few months is no time at all to start drumming up support for such a thing). 

&gt;Putin is being used as the horror man to federalise Europe and everyone seems to be swallowing the bullshit wholesale.

In what is this a bad thing? There is a genuine danger on our doorstep who gives us a legitimate reason to stand strong, together and oppose him. Why is it bad that people put the picture forward that way. And TBF, that problem is mostly dealt with through NATO which is why very few pro-Europeans advocate for a European military.

&gt; I bet you'd be for IQ tests, and if you're below a certain IQ your vote does not count

No because IQ tests are pretty much pointless and aren't really a good measure of intelligence. I don't support a total democracy in any fashion because by design it only favours the majority by default. 

&gt;why do we even let people vote for a representatives if they're too stupid.

Because the representatives more often than not are people who take the time to look into the situation and analyse it first, unlike the typical voter who will just vote depending on whatever headline was in the paper for the past few weeks. A total democracy is a shirade and does nothing more but plonk power firmly into the hands of people like Rupert Murdoch. 


&gt;Everyone should get to vote on important issues, even you.

Disagree entirely for the reasons I've explained. If the world employed a total democracy then things like Slavery would never have been eliminated. Black people in America would still be without rights.

I agree that people are never the answer, common policies are what people should vote for, but I personally could never support Farage. I dislike all the blind devotion to that cause and the anti-EU rhetoric, much of which does not pass the fact checkers, and do not agree with his party's line on many other issues. 

Modern political climate has led to a generally high level of distrust and prejudice against politicians (which somewhat causes their attitude), so being represented by people you trust seems unlikely regardless.
