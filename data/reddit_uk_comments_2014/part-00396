However, I don't think it's right that people that have been living there since their great grandparents or longer should be forced out of the islands. Ideally I would want them to become their own nation (probably while still part of the commonwealth), then if Argentina does anything then it would be conquest rather than ""taking them back from the imperialists"". I can understand how this would be impractical however and how the Kelpers would prefer to enjoy the full backing of the UK. My view is most definitely in a small minority.

There is also some fact in the propaganda, it's not all lies. The islands were property of what would become Argentina, passed on through treaty, and the British invaded them. I'd say the reason most people can't look past their upbringing is because the view that they are ours is very prevalent. If you assimilate knowledge before you have critical thinking skills and then when you do have those skills no one around you questions them you are not likely to question this knowledge yourself. 

No harm would come to me if I were to tell people that the islands are British, but some people might strongly disagree with me. 

At least 95%. That doesn't mean that 95% support invading the islands or taking them by force, however. Most people now believe diplomacy is the only way.

&gt;Have Richard Stallmans books have managed to reach a massive audience through this method of distribution?

Yes. He is the founder of the Free Software movement, and (among other things like actual hands-on-work), his writing has contributed to the IT world we see today. Without the likes of Stallman, Torvalds, Cox and others, the technology world would be a worse place.

&gt;Did it ever occur to you that Russell Brands goal was to get the message to as many people as possible

And striking up his media contacts to get his book out there on Amazon for a token 1p or something was *so* beyond him? This isn't the 15th c. with Guttenberg's press. Distributions costs can be as low as £0 if you want them to be.

&gt;This seems like the best result possible for someone who is anti-corporate. Use their own distribution and publicity means to get a book with an anti-corporate message to a huge audience.

1) The person in question knows nothing at all about the current political scene and what these kind of parties are about (which makes sense as the poster is an immigrant supporting an anti-immigration party).

2) The poster is fully aware of the nature of BF and is trying to conceal it in order to boost the popularity of the far right.

The most important thing I think I wanted to get across was that you will be compared against people who do have degrees, so you're not playing on a level playing field. You don't need to be great, you just need to be better than everyone else who applies. Your philosophy and ethic sound good, so you're ahead of 80% of people out there. Just be weary of HR/recruitment people as they will discard your CV immediately if it doesn't have a degree on it, even if it's superb. For this reason, try and bypass them if you can (one of the reasons I suggested going through your college) or apply to smaller firms who deal with recruiting directly.

One suggestion that might help would be to contribute to an open source project. That will give you experience of working with legacy code (all code is legacy code, if anyone tells you anything else, slap them), working with other people, having your code reviewed by others, having to follow coding standards, having to work with repos and build processes and working in a team (if it's a larger OSS project, it will have QA people as well. The first time you work with a QA professional who's good at their job might completely change the way you think about software!). Just be aware that if you claim to be involved in such a project, I'm going to look through their repo to see your commits, just in case ;).

Just one more thing that I'd like to say in case my original reply came across as a little negative. I've never hired anyone on the strength of their university education alone. Ever. Even placement students have had to show something extra curricular, some sort of project they've done (other people's suggestions for getting a Git Hub account are great - do it), or a side job they've had, even if it's something short term and minimal.

There is no self evident flaw. He wrote an anti-corporate book, used a corporations own machine against it to distribute and advertise, and then fucked over the corporation. They've made money out of it - and I also completely dispute that the people pirating via his tweets it would have bought it.

&gt;And striking up his media contacts to get his book out there on Amazon for a token 1p or something was so beyond him? This isn't the 15th c. with Guttenberg's press. Distributions costs can be as low as £0 if you want them to be.

Book was available for several days on audible.com for free, so he did do that.

I'm also amazed that you keep avoiding the issue of publicity. Would his book have had a Tube advertising campaign if he set it up with his ""media contacts"" on Amazon instead of a publisher?

&gt;Yes. He is the founder of the Free Software movement, and (among other things like actual hands-on-work), his writing has contributed to the IT world we see today. Without the likes of Stallman, Torvalds, Cox and others, the technology world would be a worse place.

So if I go to people on the street tomorrow and say ""Have you heard of Richard Stallmans books?"" and follow it up with ""Have you heard of Russell Brands books?"", lets say I ask 10,000 people for a huge sample size, what's the % on each question do you think?

I've said this to you in our other comment thread, but Stallman makes books for a technical audience who seek him out and are likely to use his online distribution means. Russell Brand was writing a book he wanted to mass distribute. Two totally different goals.

&gt; In July 2007, under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 the Ministry of Defence published Operation Banner: An analysis of military operations in Northern Ireland, which reflected on the Army's role in the conflict and the strategic and operational lessons drawn from their involvement.[2][4] The paper divides the IRA activity and tactics in two main periods: The ""insurgency"" phase (1971–1972), and the ""terrorist"" phase (1972–1997).[75] The British Army claims to have curbed the IRA insurgency by 1972, after Operation Motorman. The IRA then reemerged as a cell-structured organisation.[75] **The report also asserts that the government efforts by the 1980s were aimed to destroy the IRA, rather than negotiate a political solution.[76] One of the findings of the document is the failure of the British Army to tackle the IRA at strategic level and the lack of a single campaign authority and plan.[77]** The paper stops short of claiming that ""Northern Ireland has achieved a state of lasting peace"" and acknowledges that as late as 2006, there were still ""areas of Northern Ireland out of bounds to soldiers.""[Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Banner#Analysis_of_the_operation)

Your assertion is entirely wrong; the British Army went all out in the late 80's and early 90's, it had absolutely no intention of creating a scenario for peace; as it states quite clearly in its own report. Co-incidentally this same period saw a huge increase in collusion and collaboration with Loyalist death squads.

Our defence refused to hoof the ball out of the box, and instead wanted to pass it out, which fucked us up all the way through the second half. Exact same defending we had against Ipswich, just Ipswich were better at capitalising on our mistakes.

Not looked at too much, but you could see Derby were also struggling at the back, and could hardly handle our attacks. However since they could clear it properly, it wasn't a constant onslaught.

This was a game of awful defence, and ours was worse. The main problem to take from this game is clearances, fucked us up more than anything else because it put us under pressure constantly.

&gt;If you think there is no one who should stand to benefit from the capital costs of the factory, the machines, etc then you are severely deluded.

Of course, in fact this is exactly my point. Someone should benefit from having capital and at the moment it's the capitalist, they make more capital merely because they already have capital. In a socialist society the workforce as a whole would benefit from holding the capital collectively. 

&gt;The problems are: subjective value is reality, labour theory of value is totally disconnected from reality.

Well first of all I should clarify that by no means is the LTV the only reason to object to capitalism. Hierarchical power structures, internal contradictions that lead to periodic crises, inevitable imperialism, alienation and the stratification of society into classes are but to name a few. 

As for your point, fine - for the sake of argument let's accept that value is subjective. However, you still must accept that workers add value to products - if they didn't they wouldn't be employed. If their boss pays them the full amount of value they added then the boss has no money, therefore they must exploit them. And, as I explained before, due to the effects of the market they must exploit them as much as they possibly can.

&gt;If you try forcing me to pay $8 for something that you spent x amount of time labouring to make, and I don't value it at all, I'll tell you to f right off.

This is called the *Das Mudpie* argument and it tells me that you really don't understand the Law of Value. I'd check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UltE6U4t8Vc) if you want to learn why it's so wrong.

&gt;Secondly, without ownership, no one takes care of stuff. This applies to personal affects as well as a factory and the tooling therein.

Yes, this is an odd version of the tragedy of the commons argument. But your premise is wrong, because the means of production are owned not by nobody, but by the workers who work there. They have an incentive to maintain them because they don't want to go out of business and loose their job, if anything they have more of an incentive because now any damages/mistakes come out of their pay packet - not the boss who's exploiting them. 

&gt;If you don't have any experience in business, feel free to ask me for more details on why I think this.

Please, explain to me why capitalism is now so magically different just because people work on computers now.

&gt;I'm a labourer. I happen to own the means of my production.

Recently John Lydon called him out on it, Brand responded via YouTube (The Trews) and in it said ""I adore the Sex Pistols, I adore his music and I adore him, but it's a common misconception that I told people not to vote.""

So it would be a bit embarrassing for Brand if there was a [website](http://www.correntewire.com/russell_brand_vs_jeremy_paxman_the_full_transcript) out there that had a transcript of him talking to Paxman telling people not to vote wouldn't it?

You could've just read on past the fullstop to see that part?

&gt;He tells people to get out and be active directly because voting is slacktivism, vote for a party and think you've done your bit for the next 5 years.

People drop a piece of paper in a box every 5 or 6 years, and then generally disengage from the political process. They think that is their contribution done, they elect people and disengage - and then whinge but do nothing when the elected people don't deliver what they promised, because there's another election in 5 years to change them and ""that's how you effect change"" apparently... Even though nothing changes, and parties like the Lib Dems literally do the exact opposite to what they were elected to do.

If you can't see that the current voting system has created mass apathy to the political process, I don't know what more I can say to you.

&gt;So you're saying Brand never said ""I have never voted."" or "" I feel it is a far more potent political act to completely renounce the current paradigm than to participate in even the most trivial and tokenistic manner, by obediently X-ing a little box.""[1] 

No, not at all, again you are kinda making things up.

The piece of your post I actually quoted is re-quoted below, which makes the rest of your comment a waste of your own time. You are proving something I already know, unrelated to the point I was making!

&gt;He's encouraging slacktivism when he should be energising people to actually get out there and make a change.

He doesn't encourage slacktivism, he quite literally encourages the opposite, activism. According to you, only voting counts as activism?

Do campaigns like the New Era Estate, Focus E15 mums and Fire Brigades Union Pensions not count as activism?

It's sad when the only way to shut him down is ignore everything else and focus on his not voting.

3) Brand is seeking profit from his booksales

Brand seeking profit, after calling it a 'filthy word' is inconsistent. He might be putting the money towards good causes, but I hold that (a) he doesn't need the profit; he has his own money to spend without compromising his principles, and (b) he's admitted that profit is a zero-sum game that causes deficit (in this case presumably from his readers who bought his book).

Yes, but you conveniently skipped the really good point I followed that up with, so I'm just going to copy and paste it:

&gt;Celebrities fighting famine in Africa are not doing anything controversial, in fact, they are pretty much doing the least useful thing they could - supporting a ""safe"" cause that people already care about. 

Those celebs are doing the safe thing, adding publicity to campaigns which are already massively supported. That is the definition of doing it for PR.

Can Russell Brand be accused of the same thing? Wrecking his TV &amp; movie career to raise an issue which has proven to be extremely unpopular and led to bags of abuse?

&gt;If he's ""filling a void"" left by Labour's shift to the right, he better have some substance. He can't have it both ways, being both a spokesman for The Left, and saying he doesn't need solutions as he's ""just a comedian"". I think it's this hypocrisy that bothers me the most about him, and his fanboys.

OK, please don't take this **too** personally, but this is a ludicrously stupid opinion to hold. I really am sick of seeing this line of thinking floating around.

I'll go back to my classic analogies, and this time my favourite, the asteroid coming to destroy us.

- Hey there's an asteroid coming to destroy us, why aren't we doing anything?!

- Do you have a detailed engineering design and orbital mechanics plan to deal with it?

- Well, no, I'm a comedian

- Then shut the fuck up!

Right now there is nobody voicing the views of the left. Is your argument really that nobody should do so until a leader emerges? No complaining until you have the solutions? Come on, this is rubbish!

&gt;Can Russell Brand be accused of the same thing? Wrecking his TV &amp; movie career to raise an issue which has proven to be extremely unpopular and led to bags of abuse?

The moment I stop seeing him on TV, I'll believe he's ""wrecked"" his TV and movie career. I seriously doubt we won't see him back on the screen. 

&gt;I'll go back to my classic analogies, and this time my favourite, the asteroid coming to destroy us.

If I start going on about this asteroid, and if my fans start saying I'm the only one worth listening to when it comes to asteroids, and that I am the de facto spokesman of all things asteroids, that (apparently)  nobody else is talking about asteroids, then yeah, I do think I can be expected to have some ideas beyond ""asteroids are bad"". 

&gt;Right now there is nobody voicing the views of the left. Is your argument really that nobody should do so until a leader emerges? No complaining until you have the solutions? Come on, this is rubbish!

Firstly, there are plenty of people on the left, voicing views. Look at any of the political panel shows, listen to Radio 4 comedy (News Quiz &amp;c), come up to Scotland and look at a lot of the groups working for independence. No, none of them have the you-tube views of Brand. There's plenty of people on the left who have been talking about a lot of this (and a lot more) for a lot longer than the year that Brand has been involved. And who says we need a ""leader"", especially a leader that a *lot* of people on the left don't trust and don't like? 


&gt;And got crushed by the media as hippies because the message they were putting out would hurt the people that own the media. Difference is this time he is someone the media can't stop obsessing over so the story is around much longer. 

I won't argue with that, but it also doesn't negate my point that all of this has been in the news before, he's not really saying anything new.

Come on, can you compare his appearance fee on Newsnight (if they even pay them, no idea) to the money he could make doing ""Get Him to the Greek 2""? 

I really do doubt we will ever see him onscreen again, unless it is a movie made by some liberal Hollywood producer backing it with his own money. No way any corporation is going to hire someone who promotes such an anti-corporate message to star in one of their movies!

&gt;If I start going on about this asteroid, and if my fans start saying I'm the only one worth listening to when it comes to asteroids, and that I am the de facto spokesman of all things asteroids, that (apparently) nobody else is talking about asteroids, then yeah, I do think I can be expected to have some ideas beyond ""asteroids are bad""

That situation has simply not happened. I am certainly not saying Russell Brand is the only person worth listening to, I'm saying he's the guy with the biggest media image doing it, and it's admirable. I definitely do say he is the de-facto spokeman, but only because no-one else is taking it up at the level he is. 

If nobody agreed with what he was saying, or felt they were hearing it better elsewhere, he wouldn't gain any traction.

&gt;There's plenty of people on the left who have been talking about a lot of this (and a lot more) for a lot longer than the year that Brand has been involved.

And how many column inches and discussions have they generated compared to him? How nuanced were their positions in year 1?

&gt;And who says we need a ""leader"", especially a leader that a lot of people on the left don't trust and don't like?

We definitely do need a leader, but I think you misinterpreted what I said - Russell Brand is not that leader, he's the guy standing around with a big neon sign over his head saying ""Politicians, apathetic electorate available here!"" He's simply a symptom of the lack of left leaning parties.

But the left does need a leader if it has any chance of making any real change. Both Labour and Tories raced to the centre, UKIP have filled the gap on the right... Who is there for the left? The Greens? No chance.

&gt;I won't argue with that, but it also doesn't negate my point that all of this has been in the news before, he's not really saying anything new.

false,Sir_Bantersaurus,null,null,"Again though your analogy starts with the premise that it's not a recognised compliant. People knew and where debating about poverty for a long time before he came and will continue to do so after. 

I think the analogy would be someone with a camera walking into a room of people that are shouting about how we're going to stop the asteroid and demanding they stop the asteroid. That guy has no value. We all want to stop it. It's not that simple so unless you have a silver bullet then all you are is a guy seeking attention. 

Russell Brand complaining about poverty isn't the problem anyway. It's the times he does suggest solutions when it goes off the rails. He wrote a book so it's not unreasonable to expect him to back up the points he brought up but when that happens he pulls the 'i don't have the answers' card and people defend such intellectual cowardice. He wants the kudos of being part of the debate without debating anyone. 

&gt; All parties are pro-poverty in that they are locked in to a system which will always produce poverty, the best they are aiming for is reducing it. Perhaps you don't like it phrased like that, but it is true.

I don't like it phrased like that because it's simplistic and disingenuous. As Evan Davis pointed out in the interview with Brand (Brand mocked him and didn't engage by the way, usual tactic) capitalism has actually lifted a a lot of people out of poverty. Now that itself is very simplistic too. Inequality has grown a lot but does it matter as much if the bottom earners as still doing a lot better than they would have 100 years ago? What time period did people live in an era that is better than this one? I think you have to go to a time before the agricultural revolution, as soon as people started hoarding grain those with power took more for themselves. 

Finally if all parties are locked in a system that will always produce poverty then what system would not? Maybe it's not just possible and the best we can do is reduce it? 

Has there ever been a system that didn't have poverty? Maybe poverty is the natural state and the various methods of lifting people out of it have never reached 100% success. 

Even money, finance or economics isn't bad. Civilisations long before ours saw the power of these concepts.  

This is what I mean. It's very complicated. We could have long interesting debates on these things and there is no clear answer. We're the guys arguing in the room and Brand waltzes in with his camera crew and says the economy is fake because it's got the word 'con' in it. No one expects him to have the answers but he could at least have a point or a something to contribute more than vacuous soundbites. He is the type of guy who in the middle of a debate about war says 'bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity'. There is never a decent way to respond to that guy because they never add anything of value to the debate. Yet usually they don't get fretted to the extent Brand does.

Remember that only those in social housing (who aren't also penalised by bedroom tax) are likely to have their full rent paid by Housing Benefit. The rest have to put some of their meagre benefits towards their rent. Also, those in housing association properties often have to pay service charges not covered by HB.

Now factor in Council Tax. Since the abolition of Council Tax Benefit, many councils expect everyone to pay some of their own council tax (usually about 10% for those on welfare benefits).

Now factor in gas and electricity. This becomes a precious resource which some weeks you might not be able to afford at all. Also, if you're on a meter you'll be paying a lot more per unit than someone on quarterly billing.

Then there's food. Maybe you can't afford gas to cook your food. Maybe you're in an unfurnished flat (as most HA props are) and you need to replace your cooker. Can you afford enough food now to feed yourself - especially if you can't cook it?

&gt;I really do doubt we will ever see him onscreen again, unless it is a movie made by some liberal Hollywood producer backing it with his own money. No way any corporation is going to hire someone who promotes such an anti-corporate message to star in one of their movies!

Not so sure that's true. McCarthyism ended a while ago. He was able to get a publisher to print his book, I don't doubt he'd be able to get a studio to film him. 

&gt;And how many column inches and discussions have they generated compared to him? How nuanced were their positions in year 1?

I'm not sure that Brands standpoint is particularly nuanced.   

Anyway, listen, good arguing with you, but I need to go to sleep. Work early tomorrow. Thanks for a good discussion on Brand, one where you didn't accuse me of being a corporate shill, unlike some of Brands other fans on here... ;) 

Good night. I'm sure we'll have another one of these... :)

false,spacetimebear,null,null,"In the UK these days unless it's a degree from a specialized or prestigious university a degree is worth fuck all. I'd only look at the conventional methods of job acquisition if you are currently desperate for a need of cashflow. If you've finished what you've deemed to be the education you need and still live at home you are in a good position to break out from the low ball-ing bullshit rat race. A university degree in general these days is basically having a 40k~ debt to basically jump into a pile of other 40k~ debt holders waving that pretty much says ""i'm not retarded"" to get a job that you'll probably hate 6 months later. 
Honestly looking for jobs i'd look at ""start up"" companies for employment. Getting involved with a start up company in your field that may or may not make it big will provide you with some very nice and relevant experience whether the company sinks or floats. Of course if you just want to go into a big corporation then unfortunately a  degree is a massive benefit, however the role will probably just be a Junior 'whatever.' Very rarely will a degree holder get anything remotely important straight out of uni. So you're not far behind them.

However we're not here to debate the weight of a uni degree in terms of getting a job.

**Cover Letter:** Obviously when going for jobs a CV is usually the first point of contact you have. However including a cover letter, whether one is required or not can make just as big an impact as the CV. So work on your cover letter writing. The hardest thing about these things is making it stand out from the other 5000 candidates. So say things that'll make you stand out. Lets say you're applying for a job creating a database documenting pigeons or something, don't say ""i enjoy making databases and like pigeons"" Point out what it is you would actually enjoy working on in a project like that. Do you like the challenge of what it would be? The chances to improve on what you already know? Would you like the dynamics in working within a team of pigeon enthusiasts to produce a one-stop look up guide of pigeons(honestly I have no idea if there are different types of pigeon documented or otherwise, it was the first thing that pop'd  into my head.)

**CV Content:** CV's are a similar deal, just be different, not too different but different enough to stand out. Make someone remember you. To use an example the place I consult for were looking for a programmer about 6 months ago for an upcoming project. There was one CV that in particular stood out amongst the pile of other CV's. It's not that this person had exceptional skills or anything, merely competent and in line with all the other applicants. In his hobbies section he had ""I like to fly drones."" It doesn't mean much (except that he was a bit of a nerd, which to be honest is a plus for the type of role anyway) it was just different from the usual ""I watch films and read books"" or ""I like socialising"" lines thrown into these things and whoever is reading your CV might remember that as a distinguishing feature. Do you have something that might be genuinely interesting to add? Are you an avid Games Workshop visitor? Do you fix up cars in your spare time? DIY enthusiast? Spelunking?(another actual example of someone that stood out.) Put these kinds of things in your CV, regardless of what someone thinks about these hobbies what you put in your interests/about me section can help you stand out.

**Presentation:** Similarly presentation of a CV. You probably already learnt this in college, but don't make your CV a pain in the ass to read. I wouldn't want to read through 5 pages of a persons CV, make it fit 1 sheet of paper. If you can get enough in on a single side great, if not, two sides is fine. Just don't make it a book. There are many different CV layouts you can use or create all I can say is don't make it boring, but don't make it contemporary art. Use tables to manage your sections. A nice CV I once saw was quite simple. At the top it was the usual name, contact details etc (you should throw in links to your portfolio or things you've worked on here; title it appropriately. You can include ""CV"" or ""Curriculum Vitae"" if you want to be a pedantic twat but it's not necessary.) Anyway the left side of the page, maybe a quarter was separated out into headings; the usual ""Education"" ""Employment"" ""Skills"" ""About Me"" and coloured red along with whatever they had to say listed next to it taking up the other 3/4 of the page in the usual black. Doesn't sound like much but hey it was simple, clear, concise and easy to read.

**Random Tips:** Probably things that you already know but i'm gonna throw them here anyway. Power words, nope. In regards to teamwork if you include it as a skill don't ever put ""natural born leader"" even if you think it's true, it's an awfully obnoxious thing to say and actually seems to appear quite often. I always like CV's that have a few sentences about the person before the deluge of school and employment history. Take the time to write a few sentences about your achievements in your field. Something like: *My career aim is to work as part of a passionate team developing a database for the documentation and organisation of pigeon breeds. During my college years I learnt about ..(fancy stuff here)... I developed an understanding of the various structures, templates and frameworks used in planning and production of a pigeon management system. Over the past year I have created a portfolio containing miniature databases and examples of how pigeon data can be filtered, explored and managed.* Basically just a couple of sentences to show what you hope to aspire to. Keep if from being obnoxious though. When you're a big shot software engineer/consultant/expert etc then you can be as obnoxious as you like.

As someone else here mentioned things like LinkedIn can help. Also upload your CV to job search sites; indeed, SimplyHired etc. On your portfolio site make the aquisition of your CV easy. Have a button apart from the menu/header items that says ""CV"" and has a picture that symbolizes a download on it so that potential employers browsing your portfolio have an easy way to grab your CV. Do you visit any forums/internet communities linked to software development, think about adding a link to your portfolio there (consider it carefully though, if you want to do this to promote yourself don't have a CV download button on your portfolio.) There are many methods of self-promotion. Each one can be just as helpful as having a good CV. 


Anyway, good luck with the CV improvement and job search hope this helps. Oh and don't let any employer ever lowball you, if they try to pull that shit just quit(or if you need the money, start looking for a new job asap.)

Almost.

It's like a room full of people arguing over small tweaks to the solar sail solution which has already failed - and then someone bursting in and saying, hey, maybe we need to go back to the drawing board, ditch the solar sail and try something else?

&gt;I don't like it phrased like that because it's simplistic and disingenuous. 

Poverty is defined relative to wealth, and a system which encourages a small group to hold a large portion of the wealth is a system where poverty is a definite outcome.

&gt;Inequality has grown a lot but does it matter as much if the bottom earners as still doing a lot better than they would have 100 years ago?

Yes, I have no idea why you would think it doesn't? Inequality for me is a moral issue, it's irrelevant what the relative living standards are.

&gt;What time period did people live in an era that is better than this one?

This is irrelevant too though, this is like me turning to you before the founding of the NHS and saying ""When did we ever have the NHS before? No need to change anything."". Don't worry, things used to be more shit than now so be grateful and don't ask for change? Pardon my French, but fuck that, that is abandoning the advancement of civilisation.

&gt;Has the boom in food production, technology and health in part driven by capitalism and war not helped us as well? There are all sorts of areas where advances driving by a desire for profit have helped us all. Computing for one. Producing food faster with less waste has helped make food cheaper! Of course not all of this is down to capitalism. University research driven by grants, military applications, pure luck. We invented things before Adam Smith after all (though we're currently living though one of the fastest eras of invention ever).

You kind of made my point for me, many of the things we love today were produced without a profit motive which proves that it IS possible. The situation you describe where capitalism has helped us does not mean that capitalism is the only way we can be helped - it just so happens to be the way things have been. Is it actually the best, or is it just what we have?

&gt;Finally if all parties are locked in a system that will always produce poverty then what system would not?

It would be great to have a debate about that, but unfortunately all of the people with the most expertise and knowledge to enable that debate are firmly locked in to an existing paradigm and refuse to talk outside it. 

&gt;Maybe it's not just possible and the best we can do is reduce it?

I think my position on capitalism can be boiled down to this (OK it's a US example, but makes the point):

Maybe instead of the Walmart Heirs having as much money as 165 million Americans, they only need as much as 65 million Americans so that their employees don't need multiple jobs just to scrape by.

If we are going to stick with capitalism, it requires that some people amass wealth. But perhaps they don't need the obscene wealth they have...

Lloris

Walker Fazio Vertonghen Davies

N/A   N/A

Lamela Eriksen Chadli

Kane

&gt;What player(s) have impressed you most this season, why?

Kane - Obvious
    
Chadli - He went from a pretty mediocre-looking player last season to a great, clinical finisher (and dolphin)

Mason - In July most people didn't even know he existed

Lamela - He's still underperforming but that rabona is second only to Ibra's bicycle kick in my book

&gt;What player(s) have failed to impress this season, why?

Adebayor - Was great last season under Tim, has been completely useless this season

&gt;What position on the pitch is the club STRONGEST in?

Goalkeeper. Hugo is sublime and Vorm has proved to be more than decent cover.

&gt;What position on the pitch is the club WEAKEST in?

Striker. We only have one striker who can reliably score goals.

&gt;What transfers OUT need to happen next summer?

Adebayor, Chiriches, one or more CMs, most likely Paulinho, followed by Dembele and Capoue. I can't see us getting rid of Stambouli already, Mason counts as homegrown if nothing else and Bentaleb is, well, Bentaleb.

&gt;What transfers IN need to happen next summer?

Schneiderlin, possibly Cabaye. Another striker who can score goals to replace Adebayor, possibly Benteke or Bony.

&gt;Do you believe Poch has been able to implement his system yet, why?

Our play during the last month has been revolutionized. We still have moments of the good old indecisive, shitty play that has plagued us since AVB but the difference between now and then is night and day. So yes.

&gt;Are you satisfied with Poch so far, why?

Absolutely. He started out a bit slow but at least he's a man with a plan and as previously mentioned he looks like he's actually succeeding so far.

&gt;Where do you see Spurs finishing in the league this season?

Fifth behind Chelski, City, United and the scum.

&gt;How do you see Spurs progressing in the domestic cups this season?

I don't see us beating Chelski in the League Cup but with some luck we can definitely make the semis in the FA Cup as well.

&gt;How do you see Spurs progressing in the Europa League this season?

I reckon we've got a decent shot at going far. We've done well in the Europa League so far and Poch has shown that he's willing to invest in the competition.

false,Frostler,num38,,"**What do you believe is the strongest starting 11?**

Lloris

Walker Vertonghen Fazio Davies

Mason Bentaleb

Lamela Eriksen Chadli

Kane

**What player(s) have impressed you most this season, why?**

Eriksen seems to have gone up another level, Kane has solidified himself as a starter along w/ Mason and Ben Davies has outright won the LB position. Lloris is a straight up god also.

**What player(s) have failed to impress this season, why?**

I've been disappointed in Soldado and Lamela, Lamela has been better but he still needs to be better than he is right now.

**What position on the pitch is the club STRONGEST in?**

The three attacking positions behind the striker are our strongest: Eriksen, Lamela and Chadli look pretty smooth together and Townsend and Lennon are great backups.
**What position on the pitch is the club WEAKEST in?**

Striker for depth, but for talent I think we need a truly great CM to pair w/ Mason.

**What transfers OUT need to happen next summer?**

Paulinho, Soldado, Adebayor, Kaboul, Naughton

**What transfers IN need to happen next summer?**

One pacey striker like Ings or Lacazette, another CM if one doesn't step up this year.

The manager:

**Do you believe Poch has been able to implement his system yet, why?**

Not yet but it's getting there, we seem better in every way now than we did earlier. He's starting to find his best 11 and it's showing in results.

**Are you satisfied with Poch so far, why?**

Very much, he seems to have control of the locker room and we are making progress. Once he gets in more players that fit his style we will be great.

The competitions:

**Where do you see Spurs finishing in the league this season?**

4th or 5th and it will be very close either way.

**How do you see Spurs progressing in the domestic cups this season?**

We win the Capital cup, make the semi's of the FA cup.

**How do you see Spurs progressing in the Europa League this season?**

We will make the semi's.

**Who do you think will make the top 4 this season?**

false,TrouserDemon,eng-Suffolk,Ipswich,"QE has nothing to do with taxpayers money. QE isn't a transfer of money exactly. It's almost better not to think of it as money in that sense. It's a way of altering the central bank, and the private bank's balance sheets so as to prevent/ease a liquidity crisis.

To clarify, a simple liquidity crisis is when a financial institution can't pay its immediate obligations because its assets are things like buildings that take time to sell. QE was almost a kind of asset transfer to a more liquid form. Basically the central bank buys these illiquid assets(in this case mostly government bonds) with money it has ""printed"", allowing the banks to cover their short-term obligations and not collapse/lose market confidence. It prevents a spiral of collapse and bank runs.

It also has plenty of handy side-effects, where banks now have more liquid cash to lend out as mortgages and small business loans, plus disincentivising holding government bonds over market assets like shares, boosting the stock market.

At the time I didn't really agree with QE because I thought it would be more inflationary than it has been, but I'm quite happy to have been proved wrong. Long term effects are yet to be seen, but so far it's worked quite well.

Austerity is a government policy set intended to shore up the government's ability to borrow in the longer term by reducing spending to increase confidence in its ability to cover short and mid term obligations. It's not really connected to QE in any direct way.

""quantitative easing has transferred billions of pounds of taxpayers money into the pockets of the richest people in Britain."" is entirely incorrect.

The Debt is a value. The Deficit is a rate of change (of the debt).The debt is increasing, but the rate at which it is increasing is going down (the deficit is decreasing). Another problem is that these are often expressed in terms of GDP, which is another moving value.

It's fairly sensible economically to express in terms of the GDP which is close in value to the GNI (Gross National Income), and in that regard the Deficit has been falling under conservative rule.

The other concept is the wealth transference. In proportional terms that's technically correct, but that's misleading because in absolute terms there hasn't been a transfer. What has happened is that things have gotten better economically for the bottom half, but things have gotten even more better for the top half. Everyone has gotten better, just the top folk moreso.

&gt;As for your point, fine - for the sake of argument let's accept that value is subjective. However, you still must accept that workers add value to products - if they didn't they wouldn't be employed. If their boss pays them the full amount of value they added then the boss has no money, therefore they must exploit them. And, as I explained before, due to the effects of the market they must exploit them as much as they possibly can.

great, how do we allocate labour and capital without valuations by the market? i watched the video and i get that mud pie is a strawman, but the rest of the videos just said ""value is a complex thing involving use vs social value and supply vs demand"" &lt; until someone makes this simple and logical, i'll stick with subjective because it seems to me thats why people spend the fruits of their labour the way they do

&gt;Yes, this is an odd version of the tragedy of the commons argument. But your premise is wrong, because the means of production are owned not by nobody, but by the workers who work there. They have an incentive to maintain them because they don't want to go out of business and loose their job, if anything they have more of an incentive because now any damages/mistakes come out of their pay packet - not the boss who's exploiting them. 

yah i'm all in favour for that. i've seen worker owned lumbermills turn over millions per year. i buy everything at john lewis and waitrose (big shop there today) because i think i'll get better service and a better product because they are employee owned. do this mean i'm no longer an ancap/voluntaryist? idk i just start at the NAP and golden rule and end up opposing the state but never getting rid of the market. tell me where i'm going wrong, 'cause as much as i like employee owned (or family) business, i can only see it working in a free market, competing with capitalists and mutualists and whatever anyone else wants to try next",0,1419985866,null,0,false,0,cn9unlu,t3_2qnvsv,t1_cn9unlu,t1_cn9px4i,null,1425140298,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

But it is not absolute poverty and trying to mislead people about relative poverty is not on, nor is trying to say that absolute poverty isn't as bad as relative so long as there's lots of other people in the same boat.

There are entire extended families in India who are homeless. In the UK you do not have a homeless family, we have people with addiction or mental health issues certainly, but we don't have people who are beggars, who have children who are beggars, who have parents who are beggars and their parents are beggars. 

We don't have people who pick over hazardous waste knowing it's killing them, and having their kids pick over hazardous waste knowing it's killing them because that slow death is better than starvation. 

We certainly do have abusive family members, but we don't have wild spread child prostitution where parents are coerced into giving their children up for a short, horrible miserable existence being continuously raped. 

India is a third world country, poverty is absolute there and poverty means a whole lot different than trying to deal with cash converters and wonga.

I might be somewhat biased for being Norwegian, but this kid is incredible talented. Not only did he debut on the first team of Strømsgodset in April, he made a team regular by the end of the season, became the youngest player in Norwegian PL ever to score a goal, played himself into our national team (which sucks tho) and did put up some really good performances boosting our chance creation and offensive play by loads coming off the bench. He's also the youngest ever to play an euro qualifying match. All this BEFORE turning 16.

As of physicality, which is without doubt is biggest weakness, he makes up for it with incredible ball control and ability to glide past defenders untouched much like David Silva, which also is the player in City's squad he reminds me the most of.

If he continues his development at this pace he could be a world class playmaker within the next few years.

EDIT: As of circus, I completely agree. He's been visiting clubs all over Europe after the Norwegian league ended in September. There is no confirmed interests or evidence he's been in talk with Arsenal, but clubs the article doesn't mention include Dortmund, Wolfsburg, FC Copenhagen, Hoffenheim and PSG among others.

**Crossgar:**




Pros - It used to have quite a strong sense of community spirit with lots of different projects and events going on, particularly for kids, not so much anymore though. It also has some interesting sites of natural heritage, like the Ulster Wildlife Trust centre and the grounds of Tobar Mhuire monastery. 


Cons: A lot of the good aspects of the village have slowly eroded over the years. It not feels somewhat lifeless - just a thoroughfare for traffic travelling from Downpatrick to Belfast. It also has its fair share of insular dickheads, like any village. 




**Downpatrick:** 




Pros - It has a fascinating history. Many parts of the town 'feel' ancient, particularly up around the cathedral/Down Gaol and of course on heritage sites like Inch Abbey and Struell Wells. It's a real archaeological hotspot. The town has a great musical tradition, with bands like Ash, Relish, half of The Answer etc hailing from the town. It also has a lot of great pubs and a pretty vibrant nightlife. 



Cons -  There are A LOT of scumbags in the town. There are particular enclaves that have been hiving with subhuman wankers for 30-40 years now and don't look to be getting much better. Also, a number of areas of the town have suffered from neglect and businesses have succumbed to economic pressures, leaving the affected areas somewhat derelict, which is depressing to see. A personal frustration would also be that the town has all but lost its artistic (and particularly musical) buzz due a multitude of factors that I can't be arsed going into. Awk well.

With newly created money, which can ultimately be used to make more loans, thereby creating even more money. 

Essentially the Bank of England creates money to lend to itself (at a low rate of interest) and with the money the private savers (e.g. pension funds) are no longer lending to the government, they can lend elsewhere instead, thereby further reducing the general cost of borrowing (interest rate) by increasing the supply.

&gt;So from the rich to the poor? :P

And from the old to the young.

That's about it really.

With about £500 at current rates of interest you're looking at a return of between £2 and £15 per year depending on where you put it. 

However as you plan to grow this, the simplest thing you could do would be to put it in a good instant access savings account (or current account with good interest rate) and start to build up an emergency fund. There are a lot of options for this, but they're all pretty much the same, so with smaller sums its best to go with the most convenient one. As you already have one, I'd leave it there. Compare the interest rates but remember that you're not going to seems huge difference in return.

If you earn less than the tax threshold, then I believe you can apply to have your interest paid tax free without needing to put it in an ISA, but I'm not sure of the details, hopefully someone else can add that.

https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/credit/

If you disagree with the way the law is structured or its provisions then the best approach is to discuss this with your MP. 

The fact that there are 3 companies counters your monopoly point. 

You can't have information removed, but in theory you can prevent them from having any information about you in the first place. Any time your signed up for credit you will have given permission for the lender to submit information about you to the CRAs. 

The other problem with your argument is that it's not ""your information"" its ""information about you"". We exist in an information economy and information is valuable. You weren't responsible for creating, collating, storing or disseminating the information, which means you don't own it. The DPA provides mechanisms where you can ensure it is correct and stored appropriately so you can have some control, but it does not belong to you.

The DPA is pretty clear about the need to keep data safe,  so its little surprise the CRAs go over the top with identity checks, they could get into a lot of trouble for sharing the data with the wrong person.

Its shitty that it's private companies involved, and in my belief should be nationalised, and some requirement should be placed on the CRAs to ensure the information is accurate.

Re better attack in Europe; I have not looked at the numbers, but feel like we are scoring first or starting the game in a comfortable position in Europa games, so our somewhat toothless possession game is useful, but in the league, we're getting behind and/or conceding easily meaning we must press for goals and the opposition can just sit back and absorb. We can posses but have no ideas; no moxie, no flash of brilliance to open them up. Possession ala Barca only works when you've got a Xavi, Inesta, Messia to provide those final, brilliant bits to break into the box.

Leo Strauss claimed that many great philosophers tried to bury the true (and controversial) meaning of their work in the middle of their books, where no one but the most careful readers could spot what they are really trying to say. There has been those who tried to ""decode"" what Strauss was *really* trying to say in his own text, that he was using the same techniques to obfuscate his true philosophy. The most popular of these attempts, and among the first to advance the claim that Strauss was some great right-wing pedagogue, was a book by an academic named Shadia Drury. The book (*Leo Strauss and the American Right*) is a bizarre mix of rumours on the (some times scandalous) personal lives of Strauss's students and collogues, misreadings of source text and ""he-said-she-said"" anecdotes. Bear in mind, that Strauss worked and lived in a secular liberal democracy that strongly values free speech, he had no real reason to hide his true arguments. Contrast to Hobbes, Locke, Hume and Nietzche, all in their day could have been tried for various crimes (including heresy), if they presented their arguments more plainly. 

We actually do not know anything about Leo Strauss's politics, he held an academic position lecturing during the Vietnam war protests and Civil Rights movements, as far as we know, he has never commented on either of these, or almost any political conflict in his lifetime beyond the need for Israel and how the weak Weimar Republic led to the Nazis. At the most, his ""conservatism"" could be described as a preference for known evils over unknown ones. Nothing about the need for American militarism or whatever.

Physique - ? (180 cm and 68 kg - not sure how that translates to the US system)

Handling - 5 (top class - as seen at :30)

Neuer Similarity - 3 ( 1:16)

Lad appears to be a quality goalkeeper, garnering minutes for a highly competitive Red Star Belgrade 1999 Youth Squad, that features the likes of Kovač Stefan and Obradović Vanja.  There will be natural concerns about the progression of the boy, and whether he will be able to develop into an adequate keeper in spite of poor Serbian pitch conditions.

For occasional use I tend to only use the 5-day deal as that one seems to be truly unlimited whereas the other two are max 1GB/month (although I'm not sure how strict they are on that).

If you don't use one of these packages then mobile internet costs up to max £1 a day on the days that you use it.

Driver arrested and processed without incident. Goes to crown court due to severity of events leading up to said car chase and all of us are witnesses.

The people are organised in workers councils, syndicates and communes. Using direct democracy we debate, deliberate and collectively decide how to employ resources. Perhaps we elect delegates to organise some of this, perhaps we do it ourselves. There are several different models, you might want to check out [Parecon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_economics) as it's a very detailed proposal for how this should work.

&gt;do this mean i'm no longer an ancap/voluntaryist? idk i just start at the NAP and golden rule and end up opposing the state but never getting rid of the market.

Ahah, I certainly hope I'm swaying you away from Anarcho-capitalism. 

I think your problem is that you define capitalism as a market, whereas the a market economy is not unique to capitalism. Capitalism is defined as a system where the means of production (factories/workplaces/anything used to create value) are owned privately, rather than by those who actually work there. In a socialist society *all* businesses are owned by the workers, and I cannot use my ownership of the means of production to exploit any workers. 

Socialism can certainly operate with a market economy, if you still believe in that. I'd suggest checking out mutualism or Left Wing Market Anarchism. However, I oppose the market because for two reasons:

1. Markets produce for profit, not for society. If a factory makes bombs to flog to dictators and in the process destroys the environment then it's obviously not good for the people of the earth, but it would make a shit ton of money for the owner of the factory. If we can plan the economy we can plan for what we want and need - not what makes the most money.

1. Markets centralise power. If there are different co-operatives in a socialist society and some made more money than others than they would gain power, it would turn society ino winners and losers and the power gained by the winners would mean that society would no longer be an anarchist society. Hierarchical power structures would reemerge. 

But it sounds like you should definitely read up on left wing anarchism, I'd suggest [the Anarchist FAQ](http://www.infoshop.org/AnAnarchistFAQ) and the videos by [Libertarian Socialist Rants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLNW0sZKYhU) on Youtube.

I *just* gave you an entire list of UKIP candidates being racist and Farage being racist. 

&gt;Also, how many isolated incidents does it need

I don't think you understand the point I'm making. Racism is a structural system of oppression, in Britain black people and Asian people (especially Asian immigrants) have been and are structurally oppressed by both the state and capitalism. White people have **never** been structurally oppressed in the West and so when Diane Abbot makes a racially prejudiced comment about white people it may well be bigoted but it cannot be racist. 

&gt;I'm going to continue both our ongoing threads here, and point out that the use of the word 'chinky' is not even an isolated instance of prejudice (because it wasn't used to imply that the chinese, are say, medically incompetent or manipulative).

Um... what? ""Ch***y"" has always been used as a term of racist abuse, you cannot separate it from its historical context. If I referred to black people as ""n* ***s"" but then claimed that I wasn't using the term in a racist way, you'd laugh me out of the room.

It is more than just an isolated act of prejudice because Chinese people are structurally oppressed in the UK and there is a fairly long history of racism against them.

I've been thinking about this for a while.  I don't have a good reason to support Spurs (no geographic or familial ties).  It just happened.  I think part of it is the white and navy blue.  However, when I look at the other sports teams I consider myself a fan of (Sixers, Pre-Terrell Owens Cowboys{long story}, Phillies) I've come to the realization that my love for Spurs is probably driven by a subconscious desire to be teased and disappointed.

false,chamber37,,Joe le Tactics,"Sinclair on loan would be a decent shout I reckon. I don't doubt we could ship Zog out to a Championship side. I'd keep Andi and Richardson around though. Squad players.

Campbell is a decent option too, but would we use him? Benteke is nailed on as the striker, and Campbell isn't really a winger, is he? Also, he'd be keeping Robinson out of the team, presumably. Not sure the trade-off is worth it. I'd rather give Robinson a shot first, and bring Campbell in if he doesn't cut it. Too bad Southampton beat us to Elia. He'd have been a good loan-with-possible-transfer option, IMO. 

In terms of actually going out and buying players, it's hard to say because we can't really be sure how much Lambert will have to spend. I doubt he'll have more than 15m, and apparently half of that is going on Cleverley... so lets say he has 8m to spend, 10m as an optimistic figure.

With that in mind, might be worth looking at Belgium and Holland again if we want a creative midfielder. Fair number of talented young players in both countries, who would likely take a move to even a mediocre Premier League side because of the difference in quality and salary. So we could try for Narsingh on the wing, maybe... or we might be able to pick up someone young but decent with good potential, like Praet or Maher for 6-8m perhaps.

Failing that, we might even get away with a cheeky loan bid for Januzaj or Lingard. I mean, you could argue that Man Utd have *too many* attackers.... might be willing to let us borrow one, even if for a small fee, especially if we're giving them 7m for Cleverley. In fact, if that happens, I'd argue they owe us, personally.

Otherwise, I don't think we *need* anything else. If Vlaar goes, cover at centre back would be wise because injuries, but Clark-Okore is a decent starting pair. If Delph goes, well, we're looking at midfielders anyway, and I suppose Cleverley could slot in. If Shay retires we have Steer. If we get rid of Andi and/or Zog, again, we're already looking at a replacement in that area. I think we have most of the pieces we need for a comfortable mid-table finish.

Any framing of the debate from a South American nativist point of view (i.e. the Argentinian government seeking to portray themselves as more legitimate rulers of the islands because of Argentina's native population) is irrelevant because there were never any pre-colonial Native Americans in the Falklands, and disingenuous because at the time of the British occupation, the Buenos Aires government (Argentina did not exist at the time) was waging a war of expansion and ethnic cleansing against Argentina's native population.

&gt; There's also the argument that Britain should have renounced its claim to the islands when it gave up the rest of its colonial assets.

This point is a nonsense once it's understood that the Falklanders are just as legitimate South Americans as any other, and certainly the European Argentinians who dominate their society and government. See [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1a4j55/falklands_vote_in_favour_of_staying_british_988/c8u935w) for a very brief summation of Argentina's very limited relationship with and laughable claim to the islands. Buenos Aires chose to cut ties with Spain, Stanley chose not to cut ties with Britain. They are self-ruling but for defense, so Britain does not stake a claim they might renounce; the two countries are kept related by the Falklanders themselves.

Argentina literally has nothing to do with the Falkland Islands apart from in the continued imperial mythos of Buenos Aires, which expanded itself from the dominant city state of the United Provinces of the River Plate, to the capital of a conquered empire (the Argentina we know today) during the course of the 19th century.

&gt; the Falklands made for a good point of reference close to home for a lot of different claims and arguments that are made in other cases too.

Very seldom do we see off the ball movement in these videos, or even like how a player reacts when the opposition scores, or whether the player bothers to track back. Plus most of the time, we are unaware of the amount of pressure in the match (whether the player's team is 2-0 down when he tried that audacious dribble which went out for a goal kick etc). It's pretty sad when a YouTube channel called ""ScoutNation"" overlooks these things in their videos.

You need:
9 to 5 cleanser,

Imperialis moisturiser,
Honeytrap lip balm (optional). All by Lush.

With clean fingers apply 9 to 5 all over your face, smoothing it all over, it removes all the dirt and make up. Let that sink in for a few minutes then spray the toner water on cotton pads and wipe off the cleanser. You'll see all of the day's dirt come right off onto the pad. Once you've done that, let the toner sink in before applying your moisturiser. Apply with gentle upward strokes. Then, if you want to, apply honeytrap lip balm to your lips. Obviously nothing to do with SD but it smells of white chocolate, honey and vanilla, it also heals your lips well, so you can't go wrong! I do this morning and night and it works so well.

I'd love to hear what exactly are you challenging from the above.

&gt; Until FFP really bites, and until Liverpool have a bigger stadium, then the money the club spends on transfers will never be enough. You cannot blame FSG for living within the club’s means, and even then, they are dangerously close to the 70% mark in terms of wages-to-turnover. Years of neglect, and falling behind rich oligarchs, has left the Reds stranded. When the Premier League began, Liverpool were the richest club. By 2005 they weren’t even half as rich as the richest club (based on squad costs). Now they have the 5th-most expensive squad.

All this garble and just sounds like 'Brendan Rodgers is never wrong'.
Let me remind you, since you seem to suffer from temporal memory loss, that the philosopher had 120 million to spend. 

&gt;  You cannot blame FSG for living within the club’s means, and even then, they are dangerously close to the 70% mark in terms of wages-to-turnover.

You don't have to have a job in advance of moving to Canada on the IEC visa; the only real requirements are having no criminal record, being between 18 and 30, having the UK passport (lots of other passport can qualify for the same visa, but under the scheme specific for the country of the passport), having travel insurance and C$2,500 in your account. You can do pretty much any job, with a few sensible exclusions.

I used two of those before applying for Permanent Residency (PR) via the Canadian Experience Class route (CEC). That takes a long time to process (8 months for me, which was short) and whilst it was in process, my second IEC visa was going to expire, so I applied for a Bridging Open Work Permit (BOWP) and used that visa until my PR was approved (which was about a month ago).

It was all relatively straight forward. Fire away with questions if you have any.

I don't have too many opinions on the last four years. I think that had the libs been in on their own they'd have done very well, and I think he's worked hard to bend what the Tories would've otherwise done.

Ongoing, I'm in two minds about Clegg. I do think he's the best out of him, Cameron, Miliband by far, but I don't think he's as squeaky clean as he likes to make out.

He repeatedly says he's ""anti-establishment"" and that he thinks PMQs is a farce which I agree with. But then you watch a deputy-PMQs and he acts in exactly the same way that he claims to dispise.

In this very video he says that things are boiled down to simple statements, and yet when he did d-PMQs, he answered many questions in simple statements, often avoiding the actual question asked, and indeed in this video he pulled out some context-less numbers.

He also said that there's too much in the way of blame, something else he has done in d-PMQs.

I think Borini being a 'slightly worse version of Sturridge' is going a bit far because clearly Borini hasn't proved himself in training or in the limited time he has had to play to be featured more often. And in spite of many of Rodgers' perceived flaws, I do think that Rodgers is very good about giving players opportunities if they work hard in training.

However, the one thing Borini *does* have going for him is that he is only 23-years-old and still has time to grow and possibly be a bit of a late-bloomer and blossom into solid footballer.

What interesting is that you'll get articles on The Guardian and elsewhere by 'serious' progressives that lay the productivity and wage issues in the UK on the shoulders of the retired 'working longer' due to the removal of the retirement age. 

When you look at the figures you find that the number of people 'working longer' is about the same as the number of people coming in from the EU Accession states.

So apparently retired people working longer impacts wage growth and job availability but people coming from EU Accession states don't. 

Essentially there is a 'one world' political view being pushed here. 

The number of desired hours in the UK economy started to rise after 2004 when the limits were taken off and the retirement age abolished. It's very easy to have a growing economy if you just increase the size of the population.

This IOU counts towards banks reserve requirements and allows the banks to lend more money (should they wish to).

In normal times, they would do so because the return on these IOUs is either zero or very low and the bank can make money by increasing its loans to customers or by buying govt bonds.

At a time of very low interest rates, however, the bank may just choose to sit on these IOUs and do nothing (which is pretty much what has been happening in the UK).  

The other effect is on the assets which the central bank has bought. In the case of the UK, this has been gilts and it is likely that yields have fallen because of the QE.

A knock on effect is how the sellers of the gilts reinvest their proceeds. Lacking gilts to buy, some of the money will be reinvested in corporate bonds, foreign  bonds and a little will go into riskier assets such as equities.

Where is see the difference is that it is a relatively low cost and regressive tax, for which there is council tax benefit built in to allow for change in income/employment status.

I would happily subscribe to a land value tax that follows the australian model:

""There is a version of the Land Value Tax that works – and it is in operation in New South Wales in Australia. Crucially, farmland and people’s main homes are wholly exempt … The tax bears down on vacant land, holiday homes, investment properties and commercial properties. If we were to implement it in the UK, it would need to be
deductible from business rates so that struggling retailers and other firms were not faced with a devastating double whammy – and it might in time replace business rates altogether. Thus targeted, the tax would deter speculative land banks and would encourage property owners to develop brownfield sites and put rundown areas of inner cities back to good use. Over the longer term, it would lower the price of development land and help us get off that quintessentially British rollercoaster of house price booms and busts. 50""

I'm going through them by Doctor and am almost through the Pertwee era, so for the first three I'd suggest:

* *Time and Relative*, *Empire of Glass* or *Ten Little Aliens*  
* *Dreams of Empire*, *The Dark Path* or *The Indestructible Man*  
* *Eye of the Giant*, *Harvest of Time* or *Last of the Gaderene*

After that, there are the books in the ""50th Anniversary collection"" which are fairly reliable choices (but I've not read them myself so far):  

4= *Festival of Death*, 5= *Fear of the Dark*, 6= *Players*, 7 (They have the novelisation of *Remembrance of the Daleks*, but I'd suggest *Nightshade* instead.), 8= *Earthworld*, 9=*Only Human*, 10= *Beautiful Chaos*, 11= *The Silent Stars Go By*  

For the War Doctor, it has to be *Engines of War*  

For Twelve, if you want a full length novel, then *The Blood Cell* is the best so far, but the novella *Lights Out* is actually the best print-based tale for Capaldi's Doctor overall.   

On the subject of novellas/shorts, there is the [12 Doctors, 12 Stories](http://www.amazon.com/Doctor-Who-Doctors-Stories-Slipcase/dp/0141359714) collection (which *Lights Out* is part of) and that might be a good place to start.  

Otherwise, there are loads of short story collections, most of which feature tales by different authors featuring different Doctors, so you're pretty much bound to find something you like in any of those.

Step 1 seems sensible as your ""emergency fund"", but this is probably a little high (depending on your monthly expenditure).

After that, you want to get your money into stocks and shares ISAs as you suggest. Personally, I think HL is an expensive option and discount brokers and market tracking ETFs may be a better option.

A big ""no"" for premium bonds, in my opinion. They aren't a good long-term investment due to the impact of inflation.

My first suggestion would be to wear them as a fashion item. Otherwise, they will likely have some resale value if they are made of a precious metal.

I kid, I kid.

At the basic level, there's not much to this personal finance lark. It sounds like you are already on track with budgeting to some degree. When you start earning a real salary and having more serious expenses, it's just the same thing on a bigger scale.

Make sure your outgoings are lower than your income. Aim to save as much as possible, and from as early a point as possible. Try to make your money do the work for you - put your money into things that grow in value rather than shrink.

&gt; Do I put as much as possible into an ISA (and how does that work with tax?)?

An ISA is a tax-free savings account. 
Gains made in a regular savings account are taxed at 20%. If your bank pays you £1 in interest, 20p will be paid in income tax, leaving you with 80p in interest. An ISA is exempt from this tax, up to a maximum of £15,000 saved in the current tax year.

An ISA doesn't have to be just cash. You can put a number of other different things in an ISA too. I use my ISA for other investments, like funds. That's a long-term investment (10 years plus), however.

&gt; Do I save as much as possible to get a first mortgage?

That all depends on you, sport. Do you want to buy a house? Where will you be working? Are you likely to be settling down in that place permanently? We can't answer that without knowing more about your life situation and prospects. 

&gt;My first aim will be to build up an emergency fund, whilst paying back what I owe my family. Whilst it's not an interest debt as such, I think it's only fair. 

An emergency fund should be three months of living expenses (rent, bills, tax, food, etc) held in a separate account where it can be accessed instantly. Interest on this money is of much lower importance.

How much do you owe your family? The best ways to treat a £1,000 debt and a £50,000 debt might be very different.

&gt;So yeah, what should I be doing? Are there any books or guides you'd recommend?

[This is the one I used.](http://www.gcflearnfree.org/excel2013) spreadsheets are great for plotting your goals, available resources, your spending and your incomes. Everyone should be able to create and manage a basic excel system. If you own a smartphone you can easily plot your spending while you're on the go. Being able to get a clear picture of the money available to you is unspeakably I!portant for sensible personal finance. Don't be the guy who 'forgets' he owes 400 bucks due in 2 weeks.

Otherwise be sure to be rigorous in your research. Set yourself goals of things to learn about by the end of a week or month (you could track these with a spreadsheet) such as basic tenancy, basic credit and etc. Be realistic with what you can learn, don't try to cram it all at once.

Also be aware good PF practice won't last forever. Keep on top of relevant changes by following reputable media regularly.",0,1420024172,null,0,1420024806,0,cna8neb,t3_2qwqgs,t1_cna8neb,t3_2qwqgs,null,1425133592,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

You could translate, copy and paste what the PRC is saying about Hong Kong and you'd find millions of posts on Reddit from Westerners (especially the Anglosphere nations) saying the own things about protests in their own countries.

What I have seen from the PRC and its citizens has been a very calculated, very Western approach to the protests. 

1) Ignore the protests if you can, there's always something else to distract people with. Eventually everyone gets bored anyway.

2) Vilify the protesters but don't further their cause by reacting as they want you to react. So that means subtle media campaigns and having the rest of the population ask questions like ""why aren't they at work"" and ""they should stop causing trouble""

I also like the fact that rodgers will look to bring our own through like ojo and maybe 1 or 2 of our other youngsters.

If you want exposure to riskier investments (higher potential gains), then you can use a stocks and shares ISA.

okay let's think about this: so you want only children and parents who are rich to be in our pen and we're ignoring native British people, we need those kit-kats I agree, let's speculate on what might happen, first let's throw out the black kid because he's poor and we saw he was prone to violence with the white child, the white child can stay presumably because he is white and therefore superior? 

So first we spend kit-kats on throwing the black kid and his toys out, then we need to secure the pen with round the clock security, guards, fences, because we don't want any undesirables in the pen at great expenditure and then we audit every new foreigner for kit-kats.

Then we bring in the rich people, the parents turn up prove their credentials and then leave their child, but what's this? The rich people aren't giving us the kit-kats, and do so legally, they claim their kit-kats are earned in the cayman islands and they can't afford the kit-kats we originally audited them for.

We can't kick them out because it's legal for the rich to pay no kit-kats, and use the pen for free, so we're losing kit-kats every day because the rich are not paying for their service, then we have the extra cost of the body guard who hovers over the play pen, sometimes he spies on the children and their conversations but he has to because he has to watch everything to ensure no poor foreigners. 

Mean while a couple of children/parents we had to throw out at the audit, the parent was rich but the child was a student he studied play pen repair and maintenance but the child was poor, the family wanted to come to the pen together but we rejected the poor child, we even trained him ourselves at our nursery of play pen repair but he's poor right now so he can get lost and by extension his entire family, another child was similar he has the talent for it but he doesn't have the qualifications right now he doesn't pass out criteria though.

The original black child is now without a play pen he was originally paying his kit-kats but now he's off the grid, he is a on going cost to our play school because he tries to get back into the pen he was used to but no long pays because we told him he's not welcome, every now and again he makes it back into the pen, starving hungry, we feed him only enough to make sure he lives and spend kit-kats on healing any life threatening problems he might have got trying to get in the pen and then we kick him out.

Where does that leave the white kid? He's still in the pen, he's not getting his kit-kat any more not even one piece because the pen is haemorrhaging kit-kats paying for the rich people to use the pen for free, the creepy body guard watching the kids, soon the rich kids start complaining about the white kid he's ruining the rich kid's lunch so we move him into the corner of the pen and tell him there's no kit-kats the black child has them all.

The other kids in the pen are rich, their parents gave them kit-kats in their lunch box, not to share, the rich kids tell their friends, ""this pen is free"" ""they've segregated the poor"" so all their rich friends flood the play pen, the rich people have enough money to jump to the cheapest play pen in town at a whim so they just flood the play pen, all of them are a huge cost to our play pen and our original white child is hungrier than ever we can barely afford to keep him alive whilst he watches the rich kids driving around the pen in their new Land Drovers and Porsches.

&gt;

&gt;__Yomp__ is [Royal Marines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Marines) [slang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slang) describing a long-distance march carrying full kit. The origin of the word is unclear (one suggestion would interpret it as an [acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym) of *Your Own Marching Pace* ). It was popularized by journalistic coverage in 1982 during the [Falklands War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falklands_War). ""Yomp"" has been compared to the term *yump* used in rally-driving in the sense of ""to leave the ground when taking a crest at speed"", apparently a variant of *[jump](https://en.wikipedia.org//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/jump)*. 

&gt;The most famous yomp of recent times was during the 1982 [Falklands War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falklands_War). After disembarking from ships at [San Carlos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Carlos,_Falkland_Islands) on [East Falkland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Falkland), on 21 May 1982, Royal Marines and members of the [Parachute Regiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute_Regiment_(United_Kingdom\)) yomped (and tabbed) with their equipment across the islands, covering 56 miles (90 km)  in three days carrying 80-pound (36 kg)  loads.

false,Taure,null,null,"&gt; The point is that the central bank buys assets from a bank (it doesn't matter what) and pays for them not with ordinary money but what is essentially an IOU from the central bank.

As far as I'm aware, this happened in the US but not in the UK.

The UK's quantitative easing was more limited. BoE did everything via government gilts, they didn't buy any old bank assets. Essentially, BoE buy up huge quantities of government debt, driving up the price of that debt via supply and demand market forces (excess demand). 

When it comes to bonds, an increase in price for the buyer means a lower yield offered the issuer (essentially, the same amount of money invested buys you a lower interest rate, thus lower return on investment, and so the price of the product has essentially gone up). So UK gilt yields fell.

In doing so, the Bank of England made government gilts less attractive to private sector investments, forcing them to look elsewhere for places to invest i.e. the private sector. This is how quantitative easing stimulates private sector investment -- not by directly injecting cash into the private sector, but by redirecting investment into the private sector. 

This in turn had knock-on effects, e.g. increased demand for so-called ""junk"" corporate debt (because it was now relatively attractive compared to low-yield government debt) drove down corporate costs of borrowing (i.e. yields on the junk debt went down) and so we saw a massive glut of mergers and acquisitions.

Now, in the US the Fed did in fact go further than this and started directly buying private sector held assets as well as government assets (e.g. they exchanged Fed-held US Treasuries with short-term maturities for privately held Treasuries with long-term maturities, thus putting more cash into private sector hands when the Treasuries matured), but as I said, I don't think the UK followed suit.",0,1420027458,null,0,1420027667,0,cna98w1,t3_2qutow,t1_cna98w1,t1_cna7ht4,null,1425133314,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

first we keep the black kid, let's pretend our play pen is the best in town and as such it's attracting all kinds of people so that we get this ""flood"", rich and poor and now we have hundreds of parents at our door, some parents are paying kit-kats some are not, most of the poor are, because they can't afford to not pay kit-kats they don't have access to the cayman islands.

So we have all of these kit-kats and on day one we struggle to expand, we want to make our play pen greater than ever. Luckily we have all the tools we need, we have kit-kats and one of the new children knows pen repair and maintenance, so we give him more kit-kats to expand our pen out, while work is completed we spend more kit-kats to temporarily house our new arrivals, that should be a cost that goes away fairly quickly but even if we are struggling then we can temporarily ask for more kit-kats to cover costs or tell rich families they need to pay (we should be doing this anyway) and then reduce the kit-kat cost once we have expanded out.

Eventually with enough kit-kats in our kitty we distribute them back to the kids, the kids are no longer hungry or fighting, there's no need to fight if you're not desperate to survive, the poor kids can get to know the rich kids which can help them move up the social ladder themselves, in closer proximity the children can learn skills from each other even quicker and then play pen itself is a success with a big renovation raising the best kids in the entire town, a shining example the only entry fee is a reasonable amount of kit-kat given how much you can afford.

3.  Pushing Henderson out wide to accommodate Gerrard affects our ability to press effectively in the middle. We win possession back much quicker with Henderson in central midfield.

In Westminster, drafting primary legislation is reserved to Parliamentary Counsel only, a specialist cadre of lawyers in the Cabinet Office. These people only draft primary legislation - it's their sole function. That's how specialised it is - if you don't work for that office then you are not permitted to draft Acts of Parliament. Even instructing Parliamentary Counsel in the purpose of the legislation they need to draft is something of a learned art.

There is more flexibility around secondary legislation, e.g. regulations, which are drafted by lawyers in the relevant Government department or by Treasury Solicitor (the Government's in-house law firm). Even that requires a lot of specialist training though - by way of example, the handbook on how to approach it is called Statutory Instrument Practice and it runs to over 200 pages.

Drafting in general is a skilled task.

Finally, we're not talking about making parliament pass crowdsourced drafts through some compulsory process. Instead, the idea is to see what the general (this-website-using) public make of proposed legislation, and what they would like to see in it.

* Death threats to developers (both men and women)

* Non-stop harassment of women on twitter 
* Doxxing people for daring to disagree with Gamergate 
* Literally ruining the private lives of at least 3 innocent people

false,airz23s_coffee,flair5,,"**What player(s) have impressed you most this season, why?**

**Kane** is an obvious one. When we were misfiring in the league earlier in the season, I was watching him in the Europa being very impressed. Great positioning, willing to have a shot, and great work ethic. Was hoping he'd be able to translate it to PL performances and he has. Still a few things to fix about his game (Needs to lift his head up more often) but it'll come with time.

**Fazio** after a shaky start, and not knowing much about him, he's formed a really solid partnership with Vert. I feel much safer when the balls in the air now

**Lloris**: We all know he's good, but god damn. He has single handedly won us multiple points this season.

**What player(s) have failed to impress this season, why?**

**Kaboul** despite a beasty performance against Arsenal, still has all the issues and mistakes as previous seasons.

**Lamela** Obviously still young, but his on pitch performances do leave a lot to be desired. His decision making isn't great, and dwells on the ball too often. Seems to be working hard to fix it though, so we'll see if I still think the same come the end of the season.

**What position on the pitch is the club STRONGEST in?**

Goalkeeping, world class Lloris, with Vorm in reserve is fantastic. Everywhere else I feel we're still shaky. We still can't seem to find a consitently strong midfield duo, Chadli can go missing on the wings, Eriksen can get outmuscled, and our defense makes endless mistakes.

**What position on the pitch is the club WEAKEST in?**

Strikers. Kane is good, but raw. I love Soldado, and he improves our all around play, but he's just not firing and maybe never will. Adebayor has done what Adebayor does. Have a good 6 months, and then do fuck all till he gets farmed off somewhere else.

**What transfers OUT need to happen next summer?**

Paulinho, Dembele, Kaboul, Naughton, BAE, Chiriches

**What transfers IN need to happen next summer?**

A Bony-esque striker or two (Ezpz to find right?), a Matic-style DM, and a left winger. 

**The manager:**
**Do you believe Poch has been able to implement his system yet, why?**

He's getting there. You can see the fitness levels are through the roof simply from how much we're still running towards the end of the game. The press system relies on work ethic, which is a player based thing. 

**Are you satisfied with Poch so far, why?**

Yes. Something about his appointment felt different, like I was okay with giving him time. He was consistently tallking from the start about this being 3/4/5 year project to build and grow the club, and that feels me with a good bit of hope.

**The competitions:**
**Where do you see Spurs finishing in the league this season?** 5-7th. No way we get top 4.

**How do you see Spurs progressing in the domestic cups this season?** Quarters of the FA cup, finals of the League cup.

**How do you see Spurs progressing in the Europa League this season?** Knocked out in the round of 16 after scrappy wins of Fiorentina. 

**Who do you think will make the top 4 this season?** Man City/Chelsea/Man United/Arsenal.",0,1420031737,null,0,false,0,cnaa5nw,t3_2qpovp,t1_cnaa5nw,t3_2qpovp,null,1425132889,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

false,nieuweyork,null,null,"&gt; such that a crowd sourcing initiative would inevitably produce texts that couldn't be implemented without weakening the statute book

I hope you realise you're arguing against a strawman. No-one is suggesting (a) that the public draft legislation from whole cloth; or (b) that the publicly *amended* legislation be put into force. The fact (granting that it would be so) that the legislation wouldn't be ""production"" quality is neither here nor there.

&gt; multiple amendments will almost certainly introduce inconsistencies and weaken the overall text 

This is one area where IT can help enormously. 

&gt; what do we achieve by crowdsourcing the drafting, which is a technical exercise?

1. The actual legislative text is exposed to public scrutiny, for substantive problems (as perceived by the voting public);

2. The actual legislative text is exposed to public scrutiny, for technical problems such as those you mention above;

3. The public is able to detect, and comment on, the gap between the supposed policy, and the actual policy as it would be implemented by the draft bill;

4. The public will be able to demonstrate how specifically desired policies could be implemented, rather than anything outside of the Overton Window being waved away as ""impractical"";

5. Gaps between the popular draft and the passed legislation will potentially expose substantial differences between what the public want, and what was actually passed;

6. During the legislative process, parliamentarians may choose to take account of the popular draft, if the site has sufficient visibility;

7. Plenty of legislation passes without public comment or debate on the policy - this will, if it works, help build a community which can highlight legislation that is not getting sufficient attention; 

8. The public are frequently not engaged at the policy level before legislation passes - this will (if it works) help the public engage before legislation is passed, rather than when the media notifies them that it is coming into force; and

9. The purpose of a genuine democracy is popular deliberation over rational policies. Anything that advances public engagement advances that goal.

But this was all top-down shit. There was nothing I could do about it. Fucking frustrating.

The British public have to shoulder some of the blame in this. Civil servants are dragged though the dirt in the media at every single opportunity and the British public are only too happy to go along with it. 

Better than average pensions for civil servants? Yeah, that's to offset the worse than average monthly salaries through your working life. It's easy for a government to keep wages low and compensate this with the promise of a pension that some other government will have to worry about paying. Then they turn around and slash those pensions 'because that's what the public wants'. So we end up with shitty wages supplemented with shitty pensions. And the public wonders why they have such a shitty service when nobody with any skill will stay there longer than they absolutely have to.

What used to be a respectable career has turned into a  Mc.Walmart job. And would you want a McWalmart employee calculating your pension payments?   

One party promises to slash civil service jobs, then another promises to slash even more. The promises go back and forth with no consideration given to the number of people actually needed to do the job effectively. Until an arbitrary figure is reached which is far below the figure needed to actually do the work effectively. 

Meanwhile, the public look on in glee at those bastard civil servants getting their comeuppance...then 12 months later they are screaming blue murder because their granny's pension is taking months to be paid and when it does get paid it is all wrong. Yeah, I wonder why that is. Maybe because the workload has doubled and the moral has halved while granny's pension is being evaluated by someone with a fraction of the training they should have had.

But what does the government care? They promised cuts. They delivered cuts. The public should be happy. And they are. At least those who are not dependant on benefits.

I used to work in the Department for Work and Pensions many years ago and remember doing my training in a real old-school office. Most of the staff could still remember the days back before they had computers and everyone used to smoke at their desks. They had been there since they left school and they were close to retirement by the time I got there. Imagine the TV show 'Mad Men' only with even more cynical 55-year-olds and you are halfway there. Sure, these guys were imperfect. But they knew their shit like the back of their hands and they took pride in doing their work as proper public servants.

As such, they were really obsessed with getting every benefit claim right, down to the last fucking penny. No exceptions. They were SERIOUSLY anal about that accuracy shit. Does it take you a whole day to correct a 1p underpayment? Doesn't fucking matter. It's the principal that counts. You get that shit right or you get the fuck out of here. We are not a commercial business. Accuracy trumps everything, NO exceptions. We are professionals. You correct that mistake before you go home or we haul your ass over the fucking coals. Maybe next month you are on the other side of the desk begging for money.

I remember spending six hours calculating the correct payment on a really complicated case once. I left it on my supervisor's desk and went home. Glad to see the back of it. The next day I come in and the case is back on my desk with a little note. ""2p out. Do it again."" I spent another two hours getting it right but by god did I learn my lesson, and I never made that fuck up again. At least for a while...

A few years later the Labour government closed down all the local benefit offices in the name of 'efficiency' and started to shunt us all off to huge benefit processing centers that were little more than glorified call centers, like the ones you would find in India servicing the big banks. You ever had to call one of them before? Do you remember the quality of service you had? Well that was the model for our new method of business. Volume over quality.

Rumour was, our jobs would soon go to Indian call centers too, but the government was struggling with some old data protection laws that forbade disclosing private information to foreign countries. So we were safe for the moment.

That is when I saw the big culture change.

Suddenly people were hired 'off the street' and given a tiny fraction of the training we old guys had had. Mistakes were abundant. Personally, I transferred over to one of these centeres about a year after it had opened and I was amazed at how many over or underpayments I came across. But nobody seemed to care. Nobody.

I used to get shouted at for being a few pennies over or under in my old office, but here I saw many cases that were out by thousands of pounds. Regularly.

I worked on one case that was exceptionally difficult and I thought my calculations might have been a bit out. So I in the interest of accuracy I went and found my old supervisor and mentor to ask for advice, the one that had left that note all those years back about my 2p overpayment I mentioned earlier. 

He looked at the case papers then looked at me and said ""Just pay it. Pay it. I don't care. Nobody does any more. Pay the claimants a little extra if you think you think you might be wrong so they don't complain. Do it and move on quickly to the next one. Nobody cares about accuracy here any more. They only care about how many cases you process. It's all about the monthly stats and how many cases we clear. THEY can't let this place be seen to fail in the public eye. It's all political now."" 

And that was that. This paragon of integrity and professionalism I had trained under so many years ago had now withered to a simpering 'yes-man'. Doing the job right didn't matter any more. Only pleasing the higher-ups mattered now. And the higher-ups demanded that this new 'efficient' paradigm be seen to succeed in the public eye, regardless of the cost to the public purse. Image had become everything, regardless of actual substance.

I kinda lost all respect for the guy in that one short interaction. A few years earlier He was bawling me out for making a piddling little 2p mistake. Now he was waving off a four grand overpayment like it was nothing. Because to give it attention would be to distract from waving through other cases and bumping up the monthly stats. And if he wasn't clearing his allocated monthly stats then the centre would look bad and that would reflect badly on him. And on the ruling government.

Accuracy meant nothing under this new system. Statistical volume was everything. My old supervisor looked to me like a defeated man. A perfectionist who had been told that his high standards counted for nothing in this new system. A dinosaur in a new world. The government had to look good in this new age. Fuck the actual quality of work. This was a new system, one based on numbers alone, one that the public wants, one that panders to populist news columns in the tabloids and props up a flailing political party.

For example, in the old system we would look at benefit claims and respond to letters in the order they came in. Nobody skipped the queue unless it was a real emergency.

But in the new system we quickly learned to keep all the 'easy' benefit claims to one side until the end of the month so we could pull them out and quickly process them to buff up our numbers near the end. Is your claim urgent? Tough shit. If it's an easy one to do then we are going to leave it until the last minute so we have something to bump up our numbers in the last week of the month if we are running short. Numbers are everything now, remember? It's what the public wants and what the public demands of those lazy-assed civil servants.

I had a new supervisor who encouraged this. Unlike my old supervisor who was very experienced, this one  had transferred from some Internet banking call center and didn't have a clue how to do my job, let alone hers. She was just there to hand out memos, collect stats and arrange holiday leave. A paper manager, oblivious to the work at hand. She only cared about the stats. Fuck the quality or accuracy.

And me? Well, I stuck it out for maybe another six months or so after a total of  six years on the job. By then I had stopped taking any pride in my work and could see the same attitude in all the older people. The new guys, fresh off the street with little training didn't know any better. But I had given up. It was time to quit. 

I never took this job for the salary. Nobody did. The salary was a joke. No, I took it because I wanted to do my best in a job that wasn't completely focused on shareholder profit. I took it because I didn't want to dedicate my life to making some rich arsehole even richer. I took it because it placed a high regard in professionalism. At least it used to. I could stomach the low wages based on the slightly higher than average pension we were promised and the vague notion of job security. But with the pension gone, the professionalism evaporated and the stability tenuous I decided it was time to move on.

So one day I walked in on a Monday morning and just quit. Just like that. 

I jumped on a plane flew to another country and I never ever looked back.

Best fucking thing thing I ever did in my life.

TL;DR Old DWP was good. New DWP is all about massaging stats for politicians.

As for blaming Brendan, I,  unlike you, have decided to refrain from judging him until the end of the season, because we're not even halfway through it. Things are looking up and I believe that finishing in the top 5 is fairly typical to expect for a team with our finances, let alone in a year where we lost two of our best players. 

You say I absolve BR of blame? Well, you blame him for absolutely bloody everything, with no regard for the transfer committee's role, the owners, the players, our poor results for 5 years before him and our injury record. Spending 120m isn't as effective for teams like us and Spurs because we don't have the power to pull the very best players, and that's a fact. You also can't keep howling that figure while ignoring both net spend (where we were 100m or so below say United) and wages (where FSG visibly skimps and none of the top 4 do). The wages are absolutely minuscule at Liverpool compared to the constant leaders; we have not a single player on anywhere near 200k/week. The other teams have 4 players each on close to 300k. Go ahead and blame BR for that. Our transfer business is the result of a policy far bigger than BR, and is necessarily completely different from the oligarch teams for reasons obvious to people with a rudimentary understanding of a P&amp;L.

In my view, the worst thing Rodgers has done so far is have us at 8th (possibly 7th) at the halfway point, while bedding in half a team worth of new players (not all of whom he wanted, including our primary striker).

How long are you planning to be on a 125? Just getting your first license at 17, or moving up from a scooter, or what? If you're just gonna ditch it after a year and aren't expecting to get much cash back, some of the Chinese manufacturers (Sinnis, Kymco etc) can be pretty good, they just don't last long.

That said, ignore the stuff I just said and get whatever bike you like more. No point riding something you feel ridiculous on. Take a look at the Aprilia and Derbi 125 machines, which are a lot like the CBR - you'd have to go with quite an old bike for the Aprilia with your budget and they're a bitch to maintain but they're by far the sexiest 125 around.

After all, I'd argue that our standard of legislative drafting is probably amongst the best in the world. It's very rare to find cases of defective primary legislation (the Dangerous Dogs Act being the most famous example). If the current standard of legislative drafting is good then how will a crowd sourced alternative improve the situation?

Your reply has shed a lot of light on what you perceive the underlying problem to be, which is helpful. I think it's extremely unlikely that the draft text of legislation will not properly represent the intended policy of the Government. It's far more likely that the Government's publicly stated policy does not properly match the instructions passed to Parliamentary Council, i.e. the public is being misled deliberately or through omission. Here though the problem is not with the drafting, but with the government's stated policy, which is why I say would be useful for the public to be better engaged at the policy stage. The position is quite different for secondary legislation, which is both subjects to lesser public scrutiny, and is also more prone to error and oversight through the drafting process.

I agree that draft legislation be better accessible to the public than it currently is. However, all draft legislation is currently available on Hansard. If you're proposing a better public front-end to Hansard, specifically for draft legislation, then I think that would be an excellent idea. I doubt that crowdsourcing amendments to the draft is the best solution, simply for the reasons I've stated – drafting legislation is a specialist skill, and whilst GitHub works for coding, there are far more coders out there than statutory draughtsman.

There was one case where a guy was accidently given something in the order of a million dollars. He put it in a high interest account, and didn't spend it. When they took him to court, the courts decided in his favor that the interest earned was his, since it was under his name, and kept in his account. 

But this lady spent money she knew wasn't hers.

That's not the problem. The problem is legislation which does not properly represent the stated, publicly understood policy of the government.

Obviously, I disagree with you. The problem may be not with the stated policy, so much as with the unstated policy actually legislated.

&gt; If you're proposing a better public front-end to Hansard, specifically for draft legislation, then I think that would be an excellent idea. 

I think that would be one way of using the mooted site.

It's not a good solution to the problem you keep referring to, which is obtaining a text which could be legislated without amendment. However, no-one else has proposed it be used for that purpose.

&gt; I'd rather see the text used to analyse whether the government stated policy matches what they are seeking to achieve through the draft, and stimulating debate around that rather than how to solve it in the text.

As soon as the  banks noticed that these debts were toxic they hid them in large bundles of debt packages and traded them on, so when the market began to notice that these packages were in fact liabilities rather than assets all of the banks were holding them, and by now it's a global problem.  So we the taxpayers bailed out the banks in 09 to stop them collapsing, but they were now reluctant to lend, so the BoE sets up the first round of QE to encourage the banks to lend to small businesses which are the engine room of our service sector led economy, the problem Curtis highlights is in retrospect that money hasn't been lent to small businesses, it's largely been swallowed by the wealthy and used by the financial services industry to engage in exactly the same type of lending that collapsed the market in the first place, only this time the property is in London.

It's funny you should say that, because that's actually the central point of Marxism.

Providing the MoP is of a lot of value. Because the capitalist is able to provide it they receive that value.

[This](http://www.amazon.co.uk/lift-depression-Human-Givens-Approach/dp/1899398414) is a book that I've found really useful to help me get by. Although the main focus of the book is about how to lift depression, it can also be used as a prevention rather than a cure. I'm pointing this book out, because telling yourself things will get better isn't a very proactive approach, and I've found that to be one of the biggest factors in how I feel. If you don't change anything in your life, it's unlikely things will just change of their own accord and get better for you in general. I really hope I'm not coming across as patronising here, I have no idea of your personal circumstances - I'm just going by my own personal experiences.

And when you say you have nobody to guide you out of it, I would seriously recommend some kind of talk therapy with a professional if that's the case. Having some kind of support is so important at times like this. Even having someone you can offload to is a big help.

Anyway, I hope I haven't offended, and apologies if I have. I hope that 2015 does prove to be a better year for you!

What the fuck are you talking about? Have you read about Able Archer?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Able_Archer_83

The soviets believed the west was preparing a pre-emptive nuclear strike against them, and the way the west was behaving they had every right to. 

""""It really got to them,"" told Dr. William Schneider, [former] undersecretary of state for military assistance and technology, who saw classified ""after-action reports"" that indicated U.S. flight activity. ""They didn't know what it all meant. A squadron would fly straight at Soviet airspace, and other radars would light up and units would go on alert. Then at the last minute the squadron would peel off and return home.""[19]""

""In April, the United States Navy conducted FleetEx '83, the largest fleet exercise held to date in the North Pacific.[20][21] The conglomeration of approximately forty ships with 23,000 crewmembers and 300 aircraft, was arguably the most powerful naval armada ever assembled. U.S. aircraft and ships attempted to provoke the Soviets into reacting, allowing the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence to study Soviet radar characteristics, aircraft capabilities, and tactical maneuvers. On April 4 at least six U.S. Navy aircraft flew over one of the Kurile Islands, Zeleny Island. In retaliation the Soviets ordered an overflight of U.S. Aleutian Islands. The Soviet Union also issued a formal diplomatic note of protest, which accused the United States of repeated penetrations of Soviet airspace.[22]""

Reagan: ""Three years had taught me something surprising about the Russians: Many people at the top of the Soviet hierarchy were genuinely afraid of America and Americans. Perhaps this shouldn't have surprised me, but it did...During my first years in Washington, I think many of us in the administration took it for granted that the Russians, like ourselves, considered it unthinkable that the United States would launch a first strike against them. But the more experience I had with Soviet leaders and other heads of state who knew them, the more I began to realize that many Soviet officials feared us not only as adversaries but as potential aggressors who might hurl nuclear weapons at them in a first strike...Well, if that was the case, I was even more anxious to get a top Soviet leader in a room alone and try to convince him we had no designs on the Soviet Union and Russians had nothing to fear from us.""[55]""

Don't you think this should be illegal.

So your status is automatically devalued. 

I see why ""charities"" like this exist, but in reality I think it just makes the problem worse in the long run. It breeds resentment amongst white Britons who might be denied a placement in favour of a less capable candidate from a BME background. It entrenches your separateness and fuels the view that you get special rights above native ethnic Brits. The image of ethnic minorities will be improved by your achievements in legitimate fields of endeavour, not by fiddling with equality mandates and affirmative action legislation.

The fact that random colonial borders were drawn with no thought given to the composition of the population means that it is difficult to have peace unless you are being ruled by an iron fist because there's a weak sense of national identity. When this iron fist is removed and its army dismantled (as happened in Iraq), all hell breaks loose. 

The war in Iraq (in my opinion) was waged in an incredibly ignorant way, and as you rightly point out, was based on outright lies. The removal of Saddam opened the door to a centuries old conflict, but to suggest the war itself was the direct cause, I feel, is a mistake. 

I also feel like you're oversimplifying loads of things. British muslims going to Syria has very little to do with Iraq (though the collapse of Iraq and Syria are probably no coincidence) and lots to do with the Wahabbi control of religious doctrine in Saudi Arabia. These nutcases are paying serious cash to perpetuate their sick version of Islam around the globe and it is working.

Matic came home to us in January and is already recognized as the best in his role in the Premier League. Courtois came home and in the year's other bittersweet element, we have gotten used to seeing Petr Cech on the bench. But taking it like a man.

**Books**

Obviously the big one for me.  It’s been a good year of reading.

*White Teeth* by Zadie Smith.  Possibly the only ensemble cast that I can honestly say I sympathised with every character on some level.  You know how you can’t really explain what ‘well written’ means but you know it when you see it?  This book is well written.

[*Pride and Prejudice*](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42671) by Jane Austen.  I actually had serious doubts about this book.  I think it’s common to assume it’s a typical sappy romance, but then I was told it was a satire on that kind of thing, and I thought it might be too clever for its own good.  When I actually gave it a chance though, I found it to be warm, intelligent and funny; I loved how, for all her headstrong independence, the book doesn't ignore the reality of Elizabeth Bennett’s socioeconomic situation.

*Cold Comfort Farm* by Stella Gibbons.  I love a good self-aware melodrama, and it doesn't get much more self-aware or melodramatic than seeing something nasty in the woodshed.

*The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner* by Alan Sillitoe.  I can’t even remember why I picked this up, but I’m glad I did.  I don’t think I've ever read a more vivid portrayal of Nottinghamshire’s lower working and criminal classes.  It strikes just the right balance of sympathy without emotion.

**Short Stories**

[‘The Stolen Bacillus’](http://www.classicreader.com/book/1423/1/) by H. G. Wells, which is a story that loses its charm if I tell you why I love it so.  Similarly ‘Obituary’ by Isaac Asimov.

[‘Lord Arthur Saville’s Crime’](http://www.eastoftheweb.com/short-stories/UBooks/LorArt.shtml) by Oscar Wilde, which has these wonderful dual themes of obligation and destiny vs. free will.

**Comic Books &amp; Graphic Novels**

A new form of media for me.  I started out with *The Gigantic Beard that was Evil* by Stephen Collins, just for the name, which told an unexpectedly beautiful and poignant story.  As a life-long prose fan, that was a pleasant surprise to me, so I went looking for more.

*Castle Waiting* by Linda Medley.  A lovely comic about pasts and futures and feminism and fairy tales and a million other things.  I’m so indebted to the redditor who recommended it to me.  Both volumes shot straight up into my all-time favourite books.

I also read the first volume of *Bone* by Jeff Smith, which has possibly the most adorable looking protagonist I've ever seen.  [Look at the little guy!](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/78/Bone_Issue_1.jpg)  I’m not sure where the story thinks it’s going, but I’m very interested to find out.

**Film**

*The Lego Movie*.  Okay, so there’s that bit at the end that some people find a bit weird, but I defy any of you to name a better film based on a children’s toy.  Also, [clearly the best Batman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGVqzWrl02o#t=28).

**Games**

git - and github in particular - has a great model of allowing branches off a central ""master"" and allowing forks and even ""pull requests"", so you could branch off the official draft, modify it and have a set against that. You could then have a couple of branches off that focusing on specific concerns, or somebody could take that branch, fork it and go in an entirely different direction.

Doing this with text in a user-friendly manner is interesting to me.

As far as i see it if i call you a cunt you would be well within your right to tell me to go fuck myself and that I'm a cunt to. If you start making threats of violence or or try to hunt me down and do me harm that's crossing a line. You see IMO it's not about being offended, IMO it's about having a direct and proportional response instead of going full on nuclear straight away.

&gt; This was always going to happen, the internet would not remain lawless forever. Whether it is right or wrong? Probably both. This ""thought police"", ""rip free speech"" and ""tyrant government"" shit is so ott though. 

It is and always will be lawless that's the point. Only the people that are not very techie are having their views controlled or think they can control the views of others. Literally if i wanted to i could go out buy a Koran wipe my arse with it, piss all over it and then set it on fire. Then all i would have to do is upload it via an unsecured wireless network anomalously and no one would be able to catch me. That's a really low tech way of doing what ever you want on the internet without getting caught. There are loads of other ways you can be a cunt on the internet, you don't even have to leave the comfort of your own home to get away with what you want. 

The worlds a changed place instead of the police being lazy and going after the numpties that say and do stupid things, as it's the easier thing to do. They should get of their lazy arses and go out and sort out the truly dangerous nut jobs in society that are threatening harm or trying to actually harm someone.

Because Clinton is a near certain to win the Dems nomination (she has the money, the connections and will have learnt lessons from 2008) but the Republicans are more open. Just as the recent torture practices came to light, I think we can expect more revelations about the Bush administration (possibly some damaging stuff coming from the Chilcot inquiry here). I think that will damage the Bush name. Also, in 2008 there was a lot of unease about going Bush/Clinton/Bush/Clinton which worked against Hillary last time and could do the same against Jeb.

Or why is US politics more interesting? It's bigger, brighter, brasher and there's nothing quite like it (except maybe India's elections which are also fascinating).

false,callumgg,cnty-expat,Expat,"&gt; In the final two free elections before Hitler’s rise to power, in July and November 1932, the Nazis received 38% and 33% of the vote, respectively — a plurality but not enough to bring them into government. In the 1932 presidential election, Hitler lost to Hindenburg by a wide margin.
&gt; 
&gt; Hitler came to power not through elections, but because Hindenburg and the circle around Hindenburg ultimately decided to appoint him chancellor in January 1933. This was the result of backroom dealing and power politics, not any kind of popular vote. It is true that after Hitler was already ensconced as chancellor, the Nazis subsequently won the March 1933 elections. But this was in the wake of the Reichstag fire, when the government had passed an emergency law that sharply restricted the activities of left-of-center parties (including the arrest of many Communist leaders). Thus it is difficult to claim that these were “free and fair” elections.

I mourned when the show went on its first hiatus and was heartbroken when it went off the air. So I was absolutely beside myself when I heard that the show was coming back- even better, I had a chance to introduce my wife to one of my favorite childhood shows.

At first I was skeptical about how Davies chose to sweep aside a lot of the show's continuity, but in retrospect it was a stroke of genius. The Time War allowed the parcel out the old continuity piecemeal, without overwhelming new viewers with decades of canon and lore. By the time they brought back the Master I was a true believer. As far as retconning the Time War is concerned, I think it's a reflection of how far Nu Who has come in catching up to the breadth and depth of the old series. At this point I really do feel like they could bring back Gallifrey and the Time Lords, whereas before it would have been a disaster.

As to which version I prefer? I love them both. Every Doctor has brought something new and special to the show, and I think it's a hoot that we now have lifelong Doctor Who fans both as the lead character and the showrunner. I know that the Moffat hate runs deep, but for all his perceived faults I have always appreciated his love for the show and have been willing to spot him the occasional plot hole or misstep as a result. As someone who grew up with the show, I always enjoyed making up my own Doctor Who stories and playing ""What If?"", so I enjoy watching someone else get to do that for real.

&gt;* the type of gonads—ovaries or testicles;
&gt;* the sex hormones,
&gt;* the internal reproductive anatomy (such as the uterus in females), and
&gt;* the external genitalia.

&gt; People whose five characteristics are not either all typically male or all typically female at birth are intersex.

false,seemylolface,lfc12,,"Yep, it's going to be extremely hard to get the right keeper in, especially since the first choice keeper needs to be a really top level one.  This talk of players like Ochoa and Romero is silly... they had good world cups but they overachieved this summer and neither is a significant improvement over Mignolet.  IMO the only way a keeper like that is an acceptable buy right now is to see out the rest of this season and then take up the backup spot this summer when we are more able to get a top class keeper.

false,The_Valiant_Seahorse,null,null,"Way to completely ignore my point about wages. We pay around 125m in wages annually. The lowest top 4 team pays 165m. The top one pats 200m. That is a massive amount concentrated amongst the best players. The link between PL wages, cost of the starting XI and top 4 qualification is absolutely indisputable. Us spending 30 percent less each year than the lowest top 4 competition means anything more than 5th in a season is massive outperformance. You throw out 'we need to be a top 4 club' so nonchalantly that it's clear you have no understanding of how monumental an effort it takes to do it in this age of Premier League spending. And not just 120m in transfer fees in one season; I mean a consistently high wage bill and regular success. Until we can get players like Costa, Silva, Sanchez et al in, we can not reasonably expect to be top 4 regularly. It is a massive endeavour and finishing 2nd last year was shocking outperformance considering, which you again refuse to acknowledge.

We have no fucking God-given right to top 4 until we spend on top 4 quality players. Which we can't. Mathematically. Wages or transfer fee wise. Neither LVG nor Mourinho nor Pellegrini could change that with Balo and Lambert up front. If Rodgers gets us top 4 again in this league stacked with 300k/week players, he should be damn near unsackable. This is why Wenger will never be fired; the owners and most of their fans realize how amazing his consistent top 4 success is in context. His longevity came with stability. You just can't seem to understand that.

Part of me almost wants BR to go so you can see just how unfeasible it is to go top 4 with no financial change. I can guarantee you more of the same or worse, a la the Kenny/Hodgson era.",0,1420045691,null,0,false,0,cnafp4w,t3_2qtd07,t1_cnafp4w,t1_cnad84x,null,1425130233,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

It can't be because they've done anything much of value over that period - the amounts involved are simply too large.
