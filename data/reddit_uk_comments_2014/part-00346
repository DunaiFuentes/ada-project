&gt;

&gt;__Rafael ""Rafa"" Benítez Maudes__ (born 16 April 1960) is a Spanish [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) manager, and former player. He is currently manager of [Napoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S.C._Napoli).

&gt;Born in Madrid, Benítez played football throughout his youth and joined the [Real Madrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_C.F.) academy. He mixed his university studies with his football career at lower division Spanish teams. He joined Real Madrid's coaching staff at the age of 26, going on to work as the under 19 and reserve team coach, and assistant manager for the senior team. Benítez moved away from Real Madrid, but management spells at [Real Valladolid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Valladolid) and [Osasuna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CA_Osasuna) were short-lived and unsuccessful.

&gt;Benítez guided [Segunda División](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segunda_Divisi%C3%B3n) side [Extremadura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CF_Extremadura) back to the [Primera División](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga) in his first season in 1997, but the team was relegated the following season. He left the club, taking a brief break from football before returning to coach [Tenerife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD_Tenerife) in 2000. Benítez was appointed coach of [Valencia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencia_CF) and he proved himself to be amongst the top Spanish managers by winning [La Liga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga) in the [2001–02](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001%E2%80%9302_La_Liga) season—*[Don Balón](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Bal%C3%B3n)* and *[El País](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Pa%C3%ADs)* named him *Manager of the Year*. In 2004, another [La Liga league title](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003%E2%80%9304_La_Liga) and a [UEFA Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003%E2%80%9304_UEFA_Cup) victory were added. However, a disagreement between Benítez and the club director over team investment caused the Spaniard to switch to English [Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League) club [Liverpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.).

There are all types of statistical trickery because not all crimes are recorded equally.

He's one of my favorite managers ever and he got a raw deal, but he's far from perfect and made plenty of mistakes at LFC.

I paid a similar amount for my education in a third world country for third class education with little access to internet, research, quality teaching and support infrastructure. There are few medical facilities over there and insurance is expensive. I can go on and on about the difference in life between a third and a first world country but that is not the point.

More unequal maybe, but hardly more authoritarian. Authority as a concept has been on steady decline in Britain since WW1.

Workers have better rights than they used to, even if the job market is in dire straits. 

The only way in which society is more authoritarian is that inequality has undermined relative opportunity, in the sense that most of us cannot live like the stars of Made in Chelsea.

Also using the argument ""it's bad over there, be thankful"" is fucking insulting to say the least.

That's literally the same argument as saying ""oh they were born poor, that's there own fault.""

Are you kidding me?  Sounds very much like you've got a good job, probably have already got on the housing ladder, and are enjoying this market boom which is literally crippling two decades of people to essentially working poverty.

As for as I'm concerned, I think that the un-concensual nature of taxation is wrong.  I *have* to pay for stuff I'm not using, or don't plan to use.  At an extreme, if you know you have the gene Huntington's Disease, hasn't life dealt you quite a blow already? Why are you paying everyone's pensions, when you'll never see one?  I also appreciate that without taxation, certain services would be compromised - like acute medical care, policing, fire (if someone doesn't want fire protection, their neighbour doesn't deserve to lose their house) and many others.

Consequently, I think that the most ""just"" thing to do is to have a safety net that is just that, allow charities to pick up the slack (Government should support them at that), and ""modularise"" taxation, so if you send your kids to private school, you pay only a very minimal amount towards government education you don't use.

I think the present system is unfair, because it demotivates hard work (nothing is more demotivating than taking on extra work and paying 40% tax on it).  You may believe that everyone should earn exactly the same amount of money, in which case you'd think the present system is unfair, because it's too nice of top tier earners.  Despite that, I've yet to meet anyone who donates ""extra"" money to HMRC voluntarily - they always want other people to do it though.

Why am I explaining this?  Because I by showing you a contrasting philosophy I hope to show you why they're doing nothing wrong^probably.

I'm pragmatic.  I think when it comes to tax, the ethical code must be set by the government in the form of legislation.  You will never really see consensus except through the democratic process (even then, it's limited).

This means that Bono, Geldof, you and me shouldn't pay more tax than required at law.  If you figure out a way to pay less, that is still legal, good on you! Otherwise where do you draw the line? Are tax credits bad? Is the P87 the root of all evil?  Have I become a better man because my new employer won't let me have a gym subscription as a salary saving scheme? My last employer even did parking as a salary saving scheme - are we evil? The gaps in tax law, are not Bono's problem, they're Osborne's.

false,KIAA0319,null,null,"&gt; I always think if Germany can plan to phase out nuclear power by 2022 why can't we? 

Erm.....very different energy mix, very different approaches to power distribution, different reactor designs and ages........  The UK and Germany are very different in total energy production and consumption.  Just because Germany would like to go nuclear free has no correlation to the possibility of the UK going nuclear free.  Even if *any* country decides to go nuclear free, how do you suggest a country does it?  Win the election and they simply layoff the entire nuclear industry?  What about nuclear decommissioning, production of radioisotopes for industrial and medical use, current investments and early gate markers that are already paid for the next generation, investment in our companies developing the next generation of European reactors and so on?  As statement in a policy saying the ceasing of nuclear power is empty if these aren't considered.  How about the thousands of UK jobs which are reliant on the nuclear industry?  Even before we get to the argument of climate change by energy source, the Greens have alienated all the energy sector investors and workforce.  Can you not see that this is vastly out of favour economically?  In the Energy policy, only EN261 and EN262 covers a huge impact on our energy constraints.  20% of our base load written off in two paragraphs.  How about a few links to supporting documents to back up these two paragraphs?  And that's just the first line of your reply.  I'll grant that it is far better to see that the energy policy has been updated (Sept 2014) but that supporting documentation needs the reasoning behind the policy.  Are you opposed to nuclear for carbon, economic or technology reasons?

Back to the drug policy, I've made plenty of previous comments.  My issue about the policy is that it is 2006.  Since 2006 there have been numerous high profile cases involving Khat, legal highs, drug classification and so on.  In a period coming up to an election, shouldn't all parties have been through all of their policies and updated them?  If the drug policy hasn't been touched since 2006, what does it say about other policies? In scientific research, citing anything over 10 years unless a seminal paper for context is almost criminal.  Not citing current opinion and literature is suicide, so usually if a document lands on my desk with old references I'll immediately ask for the updated version.  Shouldn't political parties have the same accountability?  For policy volume, a million page policy would be wrong.  But as with all the EU project calls I've worked through, the headline document always has an appendix, reference source, support material or reason discussion to explain how the headline document came to be and strengthen the case.  As I point out above, 2 paragraphs for nuclear in an energy policy maybe one thing, but by by voters in the energy sector who read it on that face value.",0,1416303842,null,0,false,0,cm5uimm,t3_2m04cc,t1_cm5uimm,t1_cm39imj,null,1425968920,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt; manipulation) in crime-recording as a result of performance pressure, and approached those who told us that it was going on, but relatively little was found. [...] Our online survey of officers and staff
&gt; produced many assertions and allegations, but no-one came forward with firm evidence.

God, don't you hate reading the article instead of just fitting it to your worldview?  Also perhaps relevant, crime continues to drop in the CSEW, hospital statistics, and pretty much everywhere else.  Police aren't reporting crime properly - mostly because when somebody goes ""somebody nicked my bike saddle but I don't want it reported"", adding a crime report doesn't seem to make an awful lot of sense - but crime definitely isn't going up, and it's not some conspiracy to fiddle the stats.

The police ""whistle-blower"" had no evidence whatsoever, because, and I quote from the select committee hearing from memory, ""it's more insidious than that"".  A bit like the Illuminati, lizard-people and chem-trails. 

Random addendum. If you're a police officer walking down the street and a man walks up to you says ""I live here, and have been told by my neighbours that fifteen individual thefts have occurred on this street that they haven't reported, but I don't have any further information"", home office reporting rules say you have to put on fifteen individual crime reports, which will probably take at least 15 minutes each.

Adele was fine to make her decision, and she shouldn't be criticised, Geldof is being a twat 

But celebrities being rich doesn't mean they shouldn't help unless it's giving away millions. They do raise awareness. 


Yet people love to say they should give money away, not just for this, but all the other charity events throughout the year. Which doesn't make sense 

Bono can fuck off with his hypocrisy, and so can Geldof, especially with his attitude. But to paint the whole thing as bad is wrong, especially with an attack on all of them. An attack on something being done, 


The line ""
**It’s not the troops deployed to Sierra Leone who are going to make a real difference – that honour will go to Geldof and his merry army of pop stars, even though they probably think a hazmat suit is a creation by a hot new designer.**""  is extremely ignorant. Implying all of them are stupid for being singers and popular, while he knows about the other work being done 

The author loves to make the point they doesn't care about these popular singers, don't recognise them. That they knew all about efforts being done, the celebrities are arrogant for thinking they are helping and raise awareness, they already knew. . A bit of hipster attitude to it. 

Instead of attacking the movement and calling all of them dumb, attack the tax avoidance only, how a **few** are being selfish while asking for money.  But don't go on about how all of them are bad people for thinking they're helping, or feeling good about helping. They're making a difference.

Or it was Clara's fantasy anyway or maybe you have to have a key for the snap to work 

&gt;We've also abandoned the idea of a Doctor who refuses to sacrifice the one for the many.

Yes? The last Doctor hold onto that value truely was 8. In fact it was even a theme this season that the Doctor judges himself harshly for making these choices but he is doing it so others don't have to.

&gt;Why didn't The Doctor just command the CyberZombies to go explode themselves when he had control of them?

Because then he would have been the ""officer"" litterally commanding his soldiers to die. 

&gt;Why did Missy stick around during CyberDanny's little speech when it was the most convenient distraction during which she could have made her escape after discovering her plan backfired? 

She was fully prepared to escape but yeah that was dumb.

&gt;If love was all that was needed to resist the Cyber programming, does that mean that Danny and the Brigadier were the only dead people who loved someone?

No but people dead for a long time had been emotionally tortured in the nethersphere until they choose ""delete"" and maybe there are some other rogue cybers still stuck around.

&gt;Clara: I'm gonna murder Missy. Doctor: No, I am. CyberBrigadier: Haha, beat you to it! Seriously?! They should have left it to the mention on the plane.

Yeah...cyberbrig was a big wtf moment...especially since the actor's death was the reason the chacter died during 11s time.

&gt;Why did the bracelet suddenly only have enough power for one trip back to the really real world?

Because time-lord tech is so far ahead it's just magic. Was kind of dumb but when it stored their minds it probably stored a detailed copy if their body.

&gt;What the hell did Clara do with the no-longer-dead kid from the Middle East??? The most logical thing would have been to have The Doctor pop them into the past so it could be as if he never died, but since The Doctor thinks Danny came back, that obviously didn't happen. So what the hell did she do with that little logistical nightmare??

She's ultra resourceful, she found a way to get him home or it will be addressed at Christmas.

&gt;So, is Clara pregnant, or did Danny have a kid with some other chick before he met Clara, or are we just going to completely abandon the whole Orson Pink storyline?

Probably (hopefully) cleared up at Christmas.

To be brutally honest going that far back is largely guesswork unless your ancestors were of noble birth. English and Welsh non-nobles couldn't even read and write back then, so they wouldn't have kept track of people's movements, births, deaths etc. 

I have a lot more respect for people who move to another country and feel an affinity with it than people who never go there but claim their ancestors 1,000 years ago was from there. Scottish people have it worse with Americans and others wearing kilts for weddings despite never having been to Scotland.

Your ancestors could be English, they could be Welsh. Best thing to do is visit both and see if you feel an affinity for it all. 

&gt;2- That's great about keeping your identity. That's one thing about USA it's that the ""melting pot"" has blurred some of our original identities.

That's the thing about the US though, you're a melting pot but that *is* your identity. Anyone can be an American, because there is this identity that goes beyond race, place of birth etc.

You and your kids would struggle to be seen as Welsh, but me and my kids could easily be seen as American if I lived there long enough.

Cyclists can break and physically stop the bike with their feet if they have to, and they don't tend to be going too fast (not as fast as cars at least) and they'll be more aware of their surroundings for their own safety too. You ring a bell and the pedestrian moves or you can stop and walk around them to get past them, so cyclist vs pedestrian can be very easily avoidable, whereas cars are huge hunks of metal machinery, they take a lot more work to manoeuvre and travel at greater speeds, you can't just stop and go around a cyclist until it's safe to continue, you have to overtake and give plenty of room and be aware of so much more than a cyclist overtaking a pedestrian. Obviously it should be allowed within reason, very busy areas just aren't suitable for cyclists (city centres etc) but where I live the paths aren't exactly crowded, plenty of room for everyone!

The longer answer is that it is theoretically going to be possible for constituents to get a recall vote.

&gt; P2: Nigel Farage traded commodities

&gt; C: Nigel Farage is not a banker

Seems legit. 

From [Nigel Farage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Farage)'s Wikipedia: 

&gt; On leaving school in 1982, he decided not to go to university, but to work in the city, trading commodities at the **London Metal Exchange**. Initially, he joined the American commodity brokerage firm **Drexel Burnham Lambert**, transferring to **Credit Lyonnais Rouse** in 1986. He joined **Refco** in 1994, and **Natexis Metals** in 2003.

let's look at those things

&gt; The [London Metal Exchange](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Metal_Exchange) (LME) is the **futures exchange** with the world's largest market in options and futures contracts on base and other metals.

well, a ""futures exchange"" is surely just fancy talk for a bloke selling metal out of his car boot, right?

&gt; [Drexel Burnham Lambert](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drexel_Burnham_Lambert) was a **major Wall Street investment banking firm**, which first rose to prominence and then was forced into bankruptcy in February 1990 by its involvement in illegal activities in the junk bond market, driven by Drexel employee Michael Milken. At its height, it was the fifth-largest investment bank in the United States.

he must have strolled into the wrong building when he was on his way, pint in hand, to his honest-to-God fair-days-work selling metal! What are investment bankers doing trading metal?! Don't they know that's not banking?!

&gt; [Crédit Lyonnais](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%A9dit_Lyonnais) is a historic French **bank**.

I'm going to assume ""bank"" is a typo for ""rustic metal shop""

&gt; [Refco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refco) was a New York-based **financial services company**, primarily known as a broker of commodities and futures contracts.

What the Wikipedia article fails to mention is that they also hire work-a-day metal salesmen!

&gt; [Natixis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natixis) is a **French corporate and investment bank** created in November 2006 from the merger of the asset management and investment banking operations of Natexis Banque Populaire (Banque Populaire group) and IXIS (Groupe Caisse d'Epargne).

I'm currently working toward my coaching badges and the amount of fucking detail required to coach 11v11 tactically is insane. I'm still working on small sided games and there is just so much to know it's incredible. 

Someone like Rodgers, who's spent years and years learning and studying football at the highest level has forgotten more about football and tactics then I will legitimately ever know. Period. And I would like to think my knowledge, from playing for 20 years at a good level and now coaching, is pretty strong. But the fact is, it's pathetic compared to these level coaches. 

And I'm talking about top level *coaches* - not your run of the mill 'motivating' man managers. 

I wouldn't even feel comfortable talking to Rodgers about football at the risk of sounding simple. Yet anyone who has watched a football match thinks they're a tactical genius that sees things he doesn't?

We haven't coached at this level, we don't see the players training, we don't see the conversations being had behind the scenes, and we certainly don't see the game at the same level that top level coaches do.

If 99.99% of people in this sub (I'm only including the .01% in case there is a top A level coach floating around in here) were to take 2-5 sessions and try and coach a system, be it 4-4-2, 4-3-3, whatever, and set their side up against an identical side that has been coached by rodgers, or a Martinez, it would be the most humbling

They did have the power to stop it being used in Germany, but had no power elsewhere in the world, didn't stop them trying though...

The annoying bit was that it couldn't. We had the ability to track the activity generated in a country, but not to an individual user. Sure, the developers could have included ability in the reporting features of the tool as that information would be kept in the database the application was built on, but we elected not to do that on the basis that the amount an individual user used the tool was not relevant/useful, and would not be helpful for issue resolution (there were very few, we ran extremely thorough testing leaving almost no bugs in the tool).

We weren't even allowed to say that a piece of training for a sales tool was mandatory! That had to be cleared as well. The setup at that company was a bit crazy and it was an extremely political company as well, which made getting anything useful done very difficult.

I have no doubt that the unions and workers councils in Germany (and elsewhere in the world) are very different to what there is in the UK, and I am all in favour of workers being properly represented on the condition that the power of the union is balanced so that they can protect their members, but in a way that they aren't able to destabilise companies and by extension economies. I'm not going to sprout any nonsense about the unions ruining British Leyland - they certainly had a hand in that, but so did poor middle and senior management and so did the government of the day.

It's a layer of bureaucracy, which always adds cost. The cost to an individual company may be fairly small but across an economy the size of Germany it adds up to rather a lot, and will also slow decision making and communications within the company, which will also add to the cost of doing business and squeeze margins.

GAYE (Give as you earn) means you give out of your gross pay and the charity gets the exact amount you give. As it is coming out of your gross pay before taxes, you wouldn't pay tax on that amount (you still pay NI on it). Example: You donate £10 each month. The charity gets £10. Your take home is reduced by £8.

Gift Aid means your pay packet is unaffected. You can choose to give to charities and gift aid it. The charity can then claim back 25% of your giving. Example: You donate £8 per month.

And in fairness to the cyclists (and pedestrians) any accident involving a motorist is liable to result in injury. The chances are you’re not going to come out of it with a slight bruise on your arm and no harm done besides that – cars and other road vehicles are not particularly forgiving of flesh and bone.

So I can see why there’s a desperate need to be safe – but as you say, fixating on motorists as if they do all wake up in the morning with the intent of hurting people is *not* the way to fix anything. 

It might say something about the psychology of the more militant cyclists that they’d rather down-vote me for having this opinion and keep on raging than to look at solving anything effectively (and greater prosecutions – something I’ve seen thrown around - is not a protective solution, it’s a punishment). 

We need better / different infrastructure. Education can take us so far to make motorists AND cyclists aware of the dangers they face, but accidents will happen.

You have to adjust, look at us last year we played a number of formations. The diamond is clearly the favorite in here (and mine too) because of how great some of the football was in it. But you simply cannot play a system for the sake of it or because 'that's the system we play end of story'. 

If you have injuries, you have injuries and can't just force a system. Look at guardiola, he's played a 4-3-3 with a false nine, and without, 4-1-4-1, and now he's playing a 3-4-3 half the time. 

You need to be able to coach a number of systems. There is no point in us setting up against a 4-5-1 with a diamond in midfield that's going to create a number of 2v1s against you in midfield. 

The coaches you mentioned below stuck to formations in periods of time eg. Wenger, Fergie) when football was genuinely a lot less tactical. 

We need to be able to adjust, and Brendan knows that if we need to park a bus to win a game with 5 at the back we should be able to, if we need to clip it and go direct we should be able to.

&gt;I don’t want to be implored to give charitably by a band that travels in separate private jets because they don’t get on (One Direction), or by a man who avoids Irish taxes while simultaneously telling the Irish government to help developing countries (Bono).

&gt;“It really doesn’t matter if you don’t like this song,” said Geldof as he launched it, “what you have to do is buy this thing.” But do we? Really?

false,aidrocsid,null,null,"Certainly not. If anything it's the city planners and engineers who are ""maniacs"" here. If four people in a row hit someone in the same spot on the road it's not safe for someone to be in that spot on the road. That's not the motorist's fault, it's not the cyclist's fault, it's the fault of a system that puts the two of them together in the same road. 
  
There's also, though, the consideration that *maybe* cyclists should avoid riding when the sun is blinding motorists that are driving by them unless they've got something to make them visible. Remember, we expect bicycles to have reflectors so they'll be visible at night, and it's not really safe to ride a bike after dark without an actual light on it. We also recommend against things like walking in the road at night in dark clothing.
  
I don't know if you've ever driven at night in a rain storm, but in such a situation visibility is almost zero. A car with no headlights or tail lights would almost *certainly* cause a collision nearly *immediately* with any sort of traffic. We don't expect that cars stop being on the roads in these low-visibility situations, we light them up so we can see the car in front of us. In situations when you're driving while being blinded by the sun, you can also, again, still see cars. What you may not be able to see is people on the side of the road. That's a matter of a simple practical concern, not a matter of the choice of a driver. 
  
Basically I'd say that until they're no longer using the same roads as cars cyclists should anticipate that they will be in significantly increased danger when riding into the sun. Yes, it would be prudent of drivers to maybe slow down a bit as well, but cars have adaptations to low-visibility driving situations that significantly reduce the chances of their drivers smashing into one another. It's completely unreasonable to expect that *without* any such precautions a person will be safe in such a situation.
  
To me the crux of the problem is that people don't recognize early evening as a time of low-visibility. They think ""hey, it's not dark yet, I can see fine, I don't need to be careful"". Then they go for a bike ride into the sunset and get hit by a car four times, or blindly step out into traffic to get their mail and get splattered all over the pavement. 
  
That and the ever-present problem of two vehicles that should not share a traveling space sharing a traveling space are the actual culprits here.

&gt; Weather happens. Weather happens every hour of every day. The sun shines, rain falls, wind blows, ice gathers… And these conditions are there, right in front of us, all the time. If you leave the house at dawn on a wet winter’s day, you know the sun will be low and you know it will be in front of you as you drive east. If you leave the house and the temperature is near zero, you know there may be ice. If you leave the house and it has been raining for two days, you know there may be standing water. There are no surprises.

&gt; But our transport system and our legal system are surprised by this. When people drive into a space that they hadn’t figured out contained a person, **some people come along with tape measures and traffic cones and they scratch their heads and they wonder, what happens when you look toward the sun?** And then they write down what they think happens when you look towards the sun, and they give those writings to some people who sit in a big room. And they spend a couple of days discussing what people should be expected to do when they look towards the sun. And, after millions of years of humans looking at the sun, they generally fail to figure out what is expected.

Nice writing (emphasis mine). I'm sort of conflicted on this though. If you're driving in a line of traffic, as you normally are in this country, and are suddenly blinded because you've passed trees/houses/a bend/whatever, suddenly slowing can be almost as dangerous as not slowing.

Heh, ironically I've seen some abysmal cycling here. I'll quote my recent reply to another person of what I've seen in the last 8 or so months:

&gt; I could mention the 3 near misses I've had at pedestrian crossings from cyclists running red lights through crowds of people, or the ones that weave through traffic and busy intersections, or the one that mounted a pavement last week and had to emergency stop to avoid a woman and pram.

&gt; All real - all careless.

There is a really good cycle path that I see cyclists ignoring down towards Moseley as well - or using it then leaping off it (without looking) in to traffic. 

I don't mean to make villains of cyclists here - but when the ongoing message is how awful motorists are, it's important to point out that it's *people* who can be awful and not just one group. Cyclists are no angels either. 

We have seen improving infrastructure, I gather they're going to invest more in it around here as well so fingers crossed for that! ",0,1416313480,null,0,false,0,cm5wai5,t3_2mndoa,t1_cm5wai5,t1_cm5w15m,null,1425968077,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

[This is a population pyramid demonstrating the age and gender of the population of the UK (Source: 2011 Census; Office for National Statisitcs).](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Population_pyramid_for_the_United_Kingdom_using_2011_census_data.png)

As we can see, our population is contracting. You can see this just by looking at the shape of the pyramid. 

This basically means there are much more old people than there are young people.

The problem with this, is that young people are the workers; they are the ones who contribute to the economy.

Firstly, enjoying yourself, away from the usual home environment, with new people, in a new place, with the freedom to really find out who you will be as ""an adult"" in no way devalues the activity of earning a degree.

You can earn a degree from your parents house, through open university or as an external applicant to a university you only visit a few times a year - and earning that degree is admirable.

But that wasn't my point. Going to university is a huge life altering experience, and I am very happy that the majority of people in the UK have access to it.

And I know plenty of people who didn't go to uni who still have the same office jobs as those that did. That's just the job market being the mess it is.

Can you explain how the debt is a yoke? When I was earning the minimum amount to have to start repayments, it was around £8 a week. There are probably people out there that this is problematic for, but I can't see that as the norm.

First of all, contracts 101. For a contract to be legally binding it must contain 5 elements.

*an offer
*acceptance
*consideration
*an intention to create legal relations
*certainty of terms

from your tl;dr it would appear that all 5 elements are present and you're good to proceed.

There is already precedent for this situation that would support you should you end up in court. In the case of Nicholas Prestige Homes v Neal (2010) the Court of Appeal confirmed that an email exchange that fulfilled all five of the elements was enough to form a legally binding contract.

Terms were discussed over a number of emails that the seller accepted by replying with ‘Hi Mark, that’s fine. Looking forward to the viewings. Sally’. I bring this up because I suspect your best argument would be ""Mr Vlogger DID enter into a legally binding contract with me and all I want is for him to fulfill it or give me my money back"" rather than ""Mr Vlogger intended to scam me all along."" Needless to say I suggest getting your money back rather than a stake in this ballbag's company. On that point, does he actually own a company that's registered with Companies House?

You can use the Money Claim Online service (https://www.gov.uk/make-money-claim-online) to make a claim against the Vlogger for the original amount, the fee for this service is £105 which you can add onto the amount you're claiming plus interest at 8% p.a. Should he not respond within 14 days you can ask the courts to make him pay. Should he dispute the claim you would then need to get a solicitor involved and take the matter to small claims court.

&gt;

&gt;A __mansion tax__ is a popular but misleading name for an annual [property tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_tax) on high value homes. The tax is only a proposal in the United Kingdom, but has proved very controversial and has received widespread media coverage. At present, the most commonly cited trigger point would be a property value of £2 million.

What really pisses me off - there never seems to be a communication channel up to management level to tell them that such-and-such a task is either pointless or overly time-consuming. You would think that management would love to hear about how efficiencies can be made, which must be cheaper in the long run.

Maybe it's an issue of workers not seeing it as worth their time and effort, that ""making a fuss"" is more likely to get them in trouble than getting them praise and recognition.

What? Where? No it doesn't. The first link you used quite clearly demonstrates a higher birth rate (12.22) than death rate (9.34); whilst the second one you used even more obviously states:

&gt; Natural change (births minus deaths) contributed slightly more than net international migration to the population gain in the year. There were 212,100 more births than deaths (53% of the increase) and 183,400 more immigrants arriving than emigrants leaving (46% of the increase).

Let's say that being blinded by the sun is unpredictable (it's not really that unpredictable tbh), then my opinion is that the best thing to do is the slow down in a controlled manner. If you were approaching a blind bend then you should've already been slowing down anyway, so this shouldn't be a problem.

If you're following someone on a road, then you should always give yourself enough room to perform an emergency stop if required (e.g. a person/animal runs out in front of them and they slam on the brakes).. so really none of these things should be a problem for a line of traffic.

I'm not aware of any studies, but then I don't do research in the traffic/accident sector so there may well be lots of data available.

However, without seeing studies (assuming they exist), I'd still suggest that predictable behaviour is what keeps things safer, so if you're blinded then slowing down and using the centreline as a guide seems a good idea to me. As a cyclist, if you assume a car will be using the centre line while blinded then staying in the secondary position is probably your safest bet.

&gt; In simple, I just don't want the focus of the discussion to be on Geldof's tax arrangements as opposed to people's actual suffering as this appears to be heading towards.

You've answered your own question, if you have a campaign fronted by tax avoiding hypocrites the real message is going to get derailed. It would be better if Band Aid hadn't happened, and people with moral integrity and who knew what they were talking about discussed the issue instead, it's not like it was being ignored before.

&gt;  If they all pay their ""fair share"" of UK tax (whatever that actually means)

Fair share means the amount they owe, before they get a team of accountants to find loopholes to help them avoid it all. Geldof even has an overseas company he uses to purchase his mansions to avoid stamp duty, he's gone out of his way to avoid as much tax as possible.

&gt;  how much of that goes towards fighting ebola and how much goes towards NHS computer systems which inevitably fail, or towards fracking subsidies etc?

Yes all tax money is wasted, none goes towards saving lives in the NHS, ensuring people aren't so poor they need to rely on food banks, stopping pensioners from freezing to death, paying back our multi billion pound deficit, or anything else useful. To answer your question, the government has already pledged to give 0.7% to foreign aid, to write off third world debt, and plowed millions into helping fight Ebola.

The alienation happened in the summer after the 07-08 season (2 seasons after the FA Cup win), a season in which Alonso did not play very well for us.  Rafa knew he needed to sell to buy and coming off the season he had, it wasn't completely unreasonable to consider replacing him.  Barry didn't happen and Alonso went on to have an unbelievable 08-09 season, where we almost won the title (this is 3 seasons after the FA Cup win in 05-06).  We went back for Barry in the summer after that season, but we weren't looking to off Alonso for him.  The idea Rafa had looks to have been to play them together, but Real came calling for Xabi and you're mad if you think there was ever a chance he'd say no to that.  It doesn't matter that we did the double over them in the Champion's League the season before, they're still Real Madrid.  Like it or not they're THE pinnacle of football for many players, especially Spanish ones.  Still needing to raise cash, Rafa had to take that 30mil (which was a ton of money at the time) and look to make improvements elsewhere to lessen the blow.

He made a silly mistake in the summer after 07-08, but looked to rectify that after the 08-09 season.  He didn't get to do so because Real Madrid happened, just like it does to every other team out there.  Real always gets their man.  barca came in for Mascherano too, who already didn't like living in England and was surely looking for an exit regardless (my theory is that Barry was meant to replace him in summer 09... but then we missed him and Xabi left too so the wheels came off).

I'm not saying he should replace Rodgers here.  I'm just pointing out that the story isn't nearly as simple as you've made it seem and there was a whole lot more happening.  I've barely touched on the insane board and owners we had at the time, who were driving the club straight into the ground around Rafa and the team, which would have absolutely affected just about anything Rafa wanted to do in the transfer window as well.",0,1416319332,null,0,false,0,cm5xwit,t3_2mmdsd,t1_cm5xwit,t1_cm5t3r5,null,1425967255,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

That is, turning him into the next Stevie. I've been following Shaqiri's development for about five years now and while he isn't the most tactically astute player, just take a gander at  Joe Allen and Coutinho's pass rate this season. Or their goal to game ratios. I'm not going to start with the 'We HAVE to sign Reus!' nonsense. That's never going to happen, so let's be realistic.

Lucas needs to go to Italy, he'll do well there and I still like him, but he won't get into the first team again. 

Allen should have stayed with Swansea, one of Rodgers worst signings.

Borini is a good fringe player, but if he wants to get more playing time, he has to score more goals. 

Balotelli needs a proper strike partner, which Brendan fails to see, so we should probably let him go too. Or turn him into the next Borini.

Lambert does not deserve to warm the bench and I feel sorry for him.

Henderson is a good player, but not great. Loan him out for a year, maybe to the Bundesliga. I'd like to see how well he does outside of his comfort zone.

Mignolet is a good shot-stopper, but he can't keep hold of a ball to save his life. Constantly fumbling and spreading the insecurity to his back four.

And the big one: Stevie has to go. I love him to bits, but the last few games last season broke him and he hasn't been the same since. To be honest, he was already declining last season.

Lucas, Enrique, Borini, Mignolet, Allen, Gerrard (PERMANENT)

Henderson, Balotelli, Coutinho (LOAN)

It's still better to be middle class in Switzerland or Finland, certainly, but on a global scale the UK isn't doing too poorly.  I think median income is something like £27,000, but this includes pensions, those living on benefits etc..  

Also, cost of living makes a huge difference.  Someone earning £40k in the North may well live a better life in a nicer house than someone earning even £100k in London.   It's similar in America- in many nice cities in the Midwest, $200k buys a decent, four bedroom suburban house in a middle-class area.  In San Francisco, a similar house would cost $2.5m at least.  

The point is- it's all relative, and measuring income in absolutes often presents far from a complete picture.

&gt;What is shared ownership?

&gt;Shared ownership was introduced in the early 1980s to help people who are in housing need and cannot afford to buy a home outright. Priority will normally be given to existing Local Authority or RP tenants; those on Local Authority or RP waiting lists; key workers (for example, nurses and teachers), and other first time buyers (with a combined household income of up to £60,000 per year who are unable to purchase a home
without assistance). At present, there are approximately 120,000 shared ownership properties which together constitute the largest form of low cost home ownership after the Right-to-Buy

&gt;Through shared ownership, the purchaser buys a share of the property on a leasehold basis and pays rent on the remaining share. Further shares can be bought as and when the purchaser is able (and provided that the purchaser wishes to increase the share they own) until the property is owned outright.

You may be referring to 'PROTECTED' Ownership

&gt;In addition to these restrictions and mortgageability considerations outlined above, the
Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 has given the Government power to designate certain areas
as “protected”. These are areas where shared ownership housing is hard to replace, (for example
in designated rural areas) and housing must, by law, be retained for future affordable housing. In
order to achieve the retention of housing in theseareas, the Housing (Shared Ownership Leases)
(Exclusion from Leasehold Reform Act 1967) (England) Regulations 2009 provide:

&gt;for the lease to allow a tenant to acquire a maximum of 80% ownership of the property;

&gt;or 

&gt;that when a leaseholder is allowed to staircase to 100% ownership, an obligation is to be
inserted into the lease that the RP must buy back the property when the shared owner
decides to sell. ",0,1416320341,null,0,false,0,cm5y9ak,t3_2mnrci,t1_cm5y9ak,t1_cm5y4pw,null,1425967089,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt; The issue is complicated by access rights granted to cyclists under Section 1 of the Land
Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 (“the 2003 Act”). The 2003 Act allows cycling on most land unless
access is controlled by or under another enactment. This means that land reform access rights
do not normally apply to roads or footways as their use is restricted under various statutes.
However, the 2003 Act does allow cycling on any path where access has not been restricted by
a Traffic Regulation Order or through other legal means. In practice, this allows cyclists to use
most paths in urban parks and rural areas.

&gt;To further complicate matters, Section 7(1) of the 2003 Act states that the restriction on access
rights described above does not apply where land has been designated as a “core path” under
the provisions of the 2003 Act. **This means that cyclists may be able to cycle on a footpath, or
even a footway, designated as a core path without committing an offence.** However, it is
important to remember that access rights must be exercised responsibly and cyclists should

&gt;&gt; ""We are deeply concerned that the Government may have created a loan repayment system where, for example, a teacher is unable to secure a mortgage at age 35 because of the high level of monthly loan repayment.""

Wrt this

1) The loan has no impact on your credit files watsoever.  The only way a company will know if you have one is by asking you.

2) The amount paid back is the same for everyone earning over £20k - nine percent. So the average primary  teacher, earning £28,660 [(source)](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/10141810/Teachers-in-England-paid-higher-salaries-than-those-in-most-other-countries.html) will instead be earning £26,080. It's not that huge a chunk if you take into account the fact this is retroactively paying for your education.

&gt;Also, it creates a ridiculous situation when it comes to budgeting. Either they have to count on the students not repaying their loans (in which case why bother, pay it out as grants to the universities instead, save a lot of headache) or you don't, in which case you're overspending.

For example, if you noticed that something that you buy regularly was 50% cheaper at say tesco, you may very well remember that and make an effort to go to tesco when you run out of that product.

True

&gt; 10 years ago people were enjoying the best economic boom the world has seen in the last 100 years

True

&gt; before it came crashing down. 

Which was of their own making - and in doing so they have seen the highest rewards and offloaded the failure onto the future generations.

&gt;The point that I am trying to make is that during your life time, there will be good times and bad times

I'd expect nothing else - but I do expect people to not be so selfish that they literally sell their children's future for there own benefit just because they have done pretty well and are able to co-opt the political system to provide them a very easy life on top of what they already have.

&gt; and it is extremely immature to look at some time gone by and cherry pick all the good bits and make a case of being sorry or worse, using it as a means to justify your situation.

My situation? Is actually pretty good; but it's also completely pointless - since I can make no difference to the trajectory we are going down.  I just have to watch it all get worse and benefits get cut and the rich getting richer and poor getting poorer.

&gt; I am not implying any of what you said about my character. In fact if there is one thing that I have learnt from Britain, is the giving nature of the people here; its rare and incredibly empowering for the society as a whole. 

Poor tend to give to the poor, the upper echelons have no idea.  Watch documentaries about people who travel the world.  Those with the least are frequently show the most hospitality despite having so little.  Because they understand you can be one meal away from dying.  Those with the most just assume you are lazy and don't deserve help.

&gt; The point that I was trying to make is that I come across far too many colleagues, friends and individuals who will blame the system endlessly yet are not willing to put any effort to make their lives better.

Sure there are people who just complain, but there are vastly more who are working damn hard and not going up - not even keeping their heads above water.

&gt; I am also not denying that times are tough; yes they are. Yes the post war boom made life easier for a certain generation, so fucking what? 

So why have they sold out our future to make it even fucking nicer for them?  Greed.  That is all it is.

&gt; They didn't do it at the expense of the current generation as the article is trying to imply

Yes, they did.  There are numbers and articles and statistics fucking everywhere to back this up.  Provide some evidence that this whole thing is self-made by those under 30.  Seriously, please explain to me how I helped cause the financial recession with my no debt, no mortgage ill gotten gains?  Or maybe it's those other folk with all the power right now who have benefited massively from this collapse.  Maybe that's slightly more likely?

&gt; that's like saying that your well off neighbour is well off at the expense of the poorer neighbour. Times were different, economies were different; there were poor people then as there are now. There were good times and bad times in every generation; what's the point of blaming things on the past? 

No, it's more like saying the well off neighbour should share some of his wealth with those less fortunate.  No one is 'self made' you all rely on the infrastructure and security your taxes pay for.  It stands to reason that if one person is hugely successful that requires other people to miss out on that.  Why not help provide them with a decent standard of living in respect for there slightly worse luck?

Or are we going with the age old ""At least you weren't born in a 3rd world country"" argument again here?

&gt; Reasonable critique for self evaluation is a positive trait but this nonsense of blaming every bad thing on the previous generation and taking attribute for every good thing is immature and counter productive.

Okay - reasonable critique: How am I meant to earn enough to provide for my pension if my living costs are 2/3 of my income while at the same time saving to purchase a house, which I am very unlikely never going to be able to pay the mortgage off when I do retire thus cannot use its value to prop up my meager savings?

That's a ridiculous argument - if we don't stop now, we'll never stop, therefore immigration will continue forever?  The global population is in excess of 7 billion, nobody is suggesting that all 7 billion want to come here and live in London or Birmingham.

&gt; 2) you just proved more are arriving than leaving. 

Yes, more might be arriving, and staying, than are leaving.... so what?  We need the new blood, the new ideas, the new enthusiasm.  The retired are not going to improve this country - they've had their day, and this is where we are as a result.  We're waiting for the baby boomers to die before we can properly start to rebalance.

3) its called farm land which we need for farming not for adding millions of houses 

Have you seen the moors between Leeds and Manchester?  Saddleworth Moor is a HUGE open expanse of effectively nothing - it doesn't support many sheep, and certainly isn't used for arable crop farming.  Yes, it might not be a desirable place to start a new town, but it's one of many, many similar places where there is land, with little farming.

4) I have seen that before its not complete it doesn't show the real demand on public services or non trackable funds for obvious reasons, but just for the sake of argument lets say they do why can they not do the same while keeping the balance of people leaving the country as those arriving. 

Because you can't force people to emigrate, and how do you propose to decide who gets to come in and who doesn't?  Is it on a first come, first served basis, or do those with an education take priority, or is it measured on a scale of ""How much have you been persecuted / How many times have you been raped / How many times has your country of birth beaten you in jail?""

Who are we to say to two near-identical families, ""Yes, YOU get to come in, but no YOU get to go back and die.""?

5) you get my upvote for giving me a good conversation.

In a way I kind of hand it to her for keeping it real. She grew up in a working class family and she probably didn't do great in school, so her political opinions were never going to be well developed from the start, but she didn't become a celebrity and change her personality. She will always say whatever is on her mind, regardless of how it might affect her image. Time will tell if this ends up being a particularly bad thing.

I can only talk about the places I've lived in the last year or so:

* Spain: high unemployment, cheap properties, right wing government clamping down on protests and blaming economic issues on abortions
* Maldives: Unless you're planning on converting to islam and/or like bacon, that's a non-starter. I won't even start on their political problems
*  Brazil: Inequality everywhere, weird obsession with hiring far more people to do a job than is required. Why do you need to hire someone to operate a shopping centre lift? Problems with corruption, crime and a general lack of following the law. Evangelical Christians getting involved in politics.
* Peru: Amazing food and drink. Some problems with crime, especially in poorer areas of Lima. You have a choice of living with altitude sickness or clouds 8 months of the year. Didn't pay a lot of attention to the politics of the country, but they're only twenty years out of a dictatorship. Old habits die hard, etc. A government minister was recently arrested for murdering of some journalists during the war against the rebels. But the food and drink are unrivalled in the world.
* Belize: Just no. 40% import duties on everything. High crime rate and poverty. Limited options in the shops. There's not even a cinema in the country. Even the Maldives has a cinema. Crossing the border to Mexico, the difference is very stark. The people are very friendly though. It may be a libertarian's wild frontier wet dream, but for everyone else, I would suggest elsewhere.
* Argentina: I was only there for a week, but very European feel, but they refuse to cook a steak anything less than medium rare. Avoid.

&gt;An __index fund__ (also __index tracker__) is a [collective investment scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_investment_scheme) (usually a [mutual fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_fund) or [exchange-traded fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund)) that aims to replicate the movements of an [index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_index) of a specific financial market, or a set of rules of ownership that are held constant, regardless of market conditions. As of 2013, index funds made up 18.4% of equity mutual fund assets in the US.

false,Hiding_behind_you,yorkshire,From Essex to Yorkshire,"Do you know what, on that we do agree - albeit it's completely impractical to expect people to pass a parenting class before they get pregnant, or before they give birth - what happens if they don't pass?  Baby gets aborted?  Mother gets sterilised?  But it would be nice if people had some sort of realistic idea of what being a parent meant before conception took place.  But, it'll never happen, so...

As to why we're worried about there being too many old.  Let me put it this way.  Back when retirement age was decided to be 65 the average life expectancy for a working male was somewhere close to 64.  People kept dying of things like diseases, and falling into machinery.  People might retire on a Friday, aged 65, and, as far as the state and the pension provider was concerned, ideally would conveniently die on the following Monday morning.

With improved working conditions, improved medicine and less dangerous living environments people start to live longer, with better health.  But that health doesn't go on forever, and as people get older they require more and more medical assistance.  Which costs money.  Which comes from the NHS courtesy of HM Gov.  More money goes to the elderly, less money to everything else.

At the same time, we've seen a gradual and measurable decline in the birthrate.  Fewer kids = fewer adults doing the work to earn the pennies to pay the Gov to pay for the medicine to keep Great Aunt Mabel alive.

There's been a decline in the birthrate *because* of the improved health we all enjoy:  Fewer kids die at birth or during infancy, therefore there's less need to have 7 kids now, expecting 5 of them to be dead before they're four years old.  And dead of things like Low Birth Weight, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, Malnutrition, Vitamin A Deficiency, or environmental issues such as Water Pollution or Jimmy Saville.

So the natural trend within developed nations is for the birthrate to decline.  In 2012 the average global birth rate was 19.15 births per 1,000 total population, compared to 20.09 per 1,000 total population in 2007.

As countries develop, birth rate go down.  You need fewer kids and smaller families to run a home with mechanisation in the farm and industrialisation in the cities.

So we can see the future - more mechanisation in food production, more industrialisation in manufacturing.  We just have to get over the hump of feeding and caring for the elderly.  Then we'll start to balance out.

Assuming we don't exhaust the resources first, of course.

Of course, sometimes you do get ridiculous HR people for even low level roles which will ask questions more suited to a higher position. In which case, just have a bit of fun with it. For example;

- Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

Right here. Stacking even bigger boxes as the trusted advisor for our high-level business-critical box buying clients. Throughout my time here I wish to home my skills and rise through the ranks so I am capable, and desired, to handle the larger clients.

[I imagine carrying boxes all day will make me strong enough to carry bigger boxes]

- Are you a team player?

Throughout my studies I have integrated multibox stacking solutions in scenarios which teamwork was not just a requirement, but critical. When I was 10 years old, I lead a team of fresh faced cardboard cutters through a grueling training programme to not only be box stackers, but multibox stackers. This required tight integration between myself and the box stacker training programme. Together, we delivered lesson plans in short easy to digest segments which quickly ascended the cutters into box stackers, and finally, multibox stackers which could deliver our box stacking ambitions under budget.

[I told some children to put several boxes on top of each other for free]

- What are your weaknesses?

Some time ago, I learnt that boxes of a certain length were not possible to be carried by me alone. On personal reflection I realised that it is not wise to rely on myself for everything. To remedy this, I have learnt to assess the length of boxes and even other factors, such as weight and shape. This lead me to the conclusion which I continue to work on, that some boxes require more than 1 boxlifter. This has also enhanced my communication skills.

[I'm not yet strong enough to lift all boxes in the world, so I ask for help when needed]

- Why are you leaving your current job?

I have reached a juncture in my life where my priorities have changed. No longer can I solely concentrate on self improvement, much like I have for the past 11 years. However now I must seek goals which require a higher level of financial enumeration in conjunction with self improvement.

[I'm sick of school and need the money]

- How would your colleagues describe you?

My colleagues often describe me as attentive, with a big personality that lends a helping hand when required. I have often been noted that I can fit things right where they need to be no matter the situation.

It is no longer 1984. It is a much more liberal and globally aware society. There have been 30 years worth of charity fundraising stunts for most people to be aware of how to give to charitable causes without Bob Geldof shouting at people. 

In fact, Bob Geldof's Band Aid/charity single method is perhaps old hat nowadays when hundreds of random people can flood your social media timelines with it. 

I understand that having the celebrity presence can bring awareness to a cause, but it feels as though they are somewhat going about it in the wrong way this time. It would perhaps be better to produce and release such a single now with the contributing artists doing so anonymously - and part of it would be about guessing just who is on the Band Aid record. It would still sell, the money would roll in, and it would feel less like a celebrity PR exercise.

This particular cause - ""Ebola"" - also feels slightly tenuous and fashionable. Long-term: tackling HIV, AIDS, Malaria, sanitation, education and general poverty would have a much greater impact. (and that's not to completely downplay the effect of Ebola at present)

&gt; Not my opinion personally, I think almost anyone well off made it thru the support of others, either people or society in general and should have to pay a reasonable level of tax.
It's why I support a UBI as simply increasing welfare won't get support from most people.

As for elsewhere, China is very accepting to British expats, Chinese people hold White Caucasian British people in a strange reverence. Many parents want their children to learn British English. Quite a culture shock, and the somewhat lubricated life can be addictive though.

If you want a change in lifestyle without learning a new language, Australia and Canada (depending on your weather preferences) are both very accepting of British nationals and have an equalish standard of living.

The USA is another option, it has just about every biome in one country, It falls under the catagory of ""nice to visit"" for me though, so I wouldn't recommend it too heartily. Plus it's quite difficult to get permanent work rights there. Good for a working holiday though.

South America is the new wild west. I don't know much about it but everyone who travels there seems to want to talk about it endlessly, so they must be doing something right. They might have an exceptional brainwashing system for all I know.

If you just want to get away from the UK for a while, I have some ideas:

* Teach English - Most of the world wants to learn English, because so many people speak it. Easy. Especially valuable skill in SE Asia.
* Work on a ship - It's not as difficult to get a job on a ship as you'd expect, plus they will train you a lot. It might be the kind of life that appeals if you don't have many attachments.
* Go to Antarctica - If I were single I might have done this after University, lots of scientific expeditions there need support staff, chefs, technicians, IT etc. If you like a bit of adventure
* Work a Ski Season - The easiest place to do this from the UK is the French alps, it's actually extremely easy to get these jobs because there are so many (I managed to get a chalet host job and I can barely boil an egg).

As for things like charity shops, they simply don't offer great profit margins and never will. However, they provide a way to reuse goods which might be disposed of otherwise, offer discounted options to people and make some money for charity at the same time. 

The Independent's piece about chief exec salaries is an interesting discussion point but I'm not entirely satisfied that there should be strict wage controls in this area. The CEO's of the biggest charities in the world effectively manage hundreds of millions of pounds, sometimes more, and are responsible for delivering complex projects around the world. You want somebody who is proven and competent and a good salary is to be expected. We're not talking a huge amount considering their responsibilities in my opinion, especially when people, like now, demand efficiency, something that will only come from effective management. I realise it may be slightly unpalatable to see charities paying large wages but I think some, not all, can be justified. 

Lastly, you linked to a video from the COO of Give Directly, a charity I'm a big fan of. I think there is great potential and the concept, at least in it's early stages, seems to be proving to be extremely effective. However, that kind of giving really only addresses a minority of projects around economic development. That model doesn't work for tackling malaria, removing landmines or creating infrastructure.

So 
2008-2009  
fatal        1        
serious   1

I don't think that is a massive difference. I'd like to see a proper statistical examination. The closest I can find is this https://fullfact.org/factchecks/are_speed_cameras_dangerous-28986

I think the problem is is that there are 'lies, dam lies, and statistics' in the words of Abraham Lincoln.

I'd like to see more cameras personally as based on the evidence presented I think they reduce accidents. I'd also favor and tougher sentences and faster easier bans (that someone can be caught speeding 3-4 times and still drive terrifies me as someone made out of flesh and bone).

The real change I would like to see is a more relevant driving test that is taken regularly instead of once. I can't believe that someone aged 80 can still drive based on passing a test 50 years ago without any assessment in-between.

In addition, I think it's important not to forget the pressure of the 'must', extrinsic rather than intrinsic desires; those things which, whilst not biologically essential, are surrounded by such social pressure from peers and the media that being deprived of them can have psychological consequences as severe as from the privation of a true need.

One example might be that of a good quality suit, something men are told that they *need* to secure employment, but which men may feel no intrinsic need or desire to own. This is a *must*, something that people are pressured to spend money on, and where failure to do so has social consequences (or the implied threat thereof). These pressures often lead to ruination and suicide, and ought not be ignored, particularly by those who expect all people to live to the mythical standard of the self-actualized, perfectly rational human who is immune to the cognitive biases and psychological vulnerabilities which all humans are affected by.

Furthermore, a human's biological needs are easily met, for example by the prison service, which these days manages not to starve or dehydrate anyone to death or let their muscles atrophy to nothing. Does that make it an acceptable standard of living for poor people, who unlike the prison population are subjected to a wide range of social and economic pressures from which they require occasional solice? Why should anyone cowtow to the acceptable standard of living limit as defined by strangers who often have no knowledge or experience of the situation?

To be absolutely clear, I'm not saying that fads or peer pressure should be embraced, or that fiscal irresponsibility is A-OK.

false,dpash,cnty-expat,Expat (Belize),"What can I say? It's a Caribbean[0] former British colony. They gained self-government in 1961 and independence in 1981. The people speak English, although a large majority speak Creole/kriol, but can speak English or something between English and creole enough that native English speakers can understand them. About 50% of the population can also speak Spanish. 

The country is quite poor, with huge crime and murder issues, predominately in the south part of Belize city (which is very close to where I live in the north part of the city). This is mostly due to gangs and drugs. A large reason for the lack of infrastructure and security is due to the low population. Imagine a country the size of Wales with a tenth of the population and without England to help. 50,000 people live in the largest city and 14,000 live in the capital. There are only four roads in the country and only two border crossings. One into Mexico in the north and one into Guatamala in the west. There's one international airport in the country.

The positives is the very relaxed lifestyle and culture here, like many Caribbean countries. Rent is cheap in comparison to other places (although nearly everything else is expensive due to 40% import duties on nearly everything). The country has many beautiful islands, and has the largest coral reef in the western hemisphere. Check out the blue hole on Google Images. There's also a lot of Mayan temples and culture in the country too. Plus large areas of undisturbed rainforest/jungle and lots of flora and fauna. So much so that Guatemalans illegally cross the border to cut down Belizean trees, because they've already cut down all of their jungle.

On the whole, there's not a lot that wouldn't be solved by a massive influx of immigration. It's a nice country with nice people, trying to live, just like everyone else, ruined by a lack of infrastructure, crime and expensive cost of living.

- You're consuming our media, which only showing how popular it is worldwide

- Westerners going to Syria and Iraq isn't an issue unique to the UK and nor is the UK the 'worst' in the western world when it comes to numbers of people having gone over there (see Belgium, Denmark, France, Australia and more).

- We've given £125m in aid to help with the ebola outbreak, more than any other country apart from the US (but 300m+ country vs. 60m+ country). We also give more aid than all countries besides one (could the US's poorest state give that much, if that story was worth anything). We are one of few countries spending more than the 0.7% that the UN asks for. As a comparison the US spends 0.19%.

- We don't cripple our people with debt if they get ill and have one of the most effective healthcare systems in the world as judged by The Commonwealth Fund

- Our economy is one of the ones performing/recovering best in the developed world and EU

- We have some of the best academic institutions in the world. In recent times someone from the UK has had a nobel prize in 10 of the last 14 years. Add onto that academics from other countries based at British universities (e.g. Pissarides at LSE who won in 2010). Some of the worlds highest regarded universities are in the UK, even when they have more restricted funding than other universities.

- The UK is doing more than most countries in reducing its carbon emissions and actually working towards meeting agreed targets.

- In terms of recorded crime we're the safest country in the EU and the number of crimes has been falling.

- We give all kids in school their lunches for free and more people on lower incomes are paying less (or no) tax.

- Our cultural output is huge and is consumed worldwide. TV, literature, actors, music etc. from this country are all known and respected worldwide and we have some of the best cultural institutions.

- We're one of the most tolerant societies. 

- We're an extremely popular country for migrants. If the country was shit nobody would want to move here but that clearly isn't the case.

The publicity afforded to the song will help raise money, which on the bottom line is good.

- That said, I also agree that there is a level of hypocrisy and insult in the fabulously wealthy donating nothing but their time to sing a song while expecting the rest of us to donate money. The celebrities did a good thing campaigning to raise awareness for Ebola (by performing in the song), but demonstrated a condescending and patronising attitude by not donating to the cause themselves.

Migration is about people moving around. We're talking about too many humans full stop. It doesn't matter where the humans move to - there's too many.

You have an incredibly simple view of economic and physical geography and the relation between the two. It's really far more complex than ""oh, there's not enough room on this island, sorry, you'll have to go somewhere else."" 

Not that that's a valid argument anyway, the British Isles from a geographical standpoint have *plenty* of potential for more people. We're nowhere near our regional tipping point yet.

Not only that, but in the future this is likely to get worse. Go on the ONS link in my above comment and use the slider at the bottom to go to future predictions.

A gold ring can always be sold for US dollars or Euros or Sterling, whereas a currency in an economically unstable country may lose its value overnight. 

When people move here from India or wherever it might be they often bring their life savings with them in the form of jewellery. It's also very common for them to continue to store wealth in this way even when they're settled in a stable economy, often in the form of gifts given to family members for occasions such as birthdays and weddings.

I'm sorry but this is totally incorrect. And quite bizarre. 

We're talking about overpopulation and therefore we're talking about feeding, housing people. So i'll focus on that.

We have literally just had an agricultural revolution in the 19th/20th centuries, and could well be on the brink of another.

The 19th/20th centuries saw mass mechanisation of agricultural work, the development of agri-chemicals such as fertilisers, herbicides, pesticides etc. which vastly increase yields. We saw new understanding of crop-rotation, eutrophication issues, biodiversity issues, etc. etc.

The 19th/20th centuries agricultural revolution was the largest in human history, and a core reason why humanity's population has exploded since the industrial revolution.

Not only this, but development of genetically modified crops and better understanding about this could potentially lead to *another* agricultural revolution this century. Feeding even more people.

So I have absolutely no idea where you've got this idea that 'humanity has not changed in a long time.'

He solves his Rubik's cubes by painting all the sides red. It's not just that he's cheating it's that it takes away from the thrill of the reveal for the audience. It's anticlimax after anticlimax.

false,Coeliac,eng-berkshire,Berkshire,"I can see the intention in the persuit of accurate and fair advertising. Following the logic, why advertise 80Mbps down and 20Mbps up to potential buyers when in reality, only 60% can get an FTTx product and only 8% can get those speeds?

On the flip side of the coin, what do you want them to advertise in terms of speed if that's something that's possible? You can't account for ""by the way, if you're more than 2 miles from the exchange you won't be able to get this and if you're more than 4 miles you probably can't get any ADSL service and might want to go to our competitors for something like Satellite internet."". You can't make a catchy line out of that, plus your competitors are all doing it anyway.

Reforming the acceptable advertising to stop the competitors is a good goal. But again, to what? Why would you want the majority speed to be the advertised one? If I live ontop of an exchange, or miles away, I will have a terrible representation of the speeds I'll get. Truth be told, in densely populated areas you will have a telephone exchange closer to you. It's a plaster ontop of a broken bone really, it doesn't solve much. Under education on what the speeds are representing is what I really see as the main issue.   
Ask anyone under 18 how they have internet at home and I would hypothesise that over 70% wouldn't know it was anything to do with their telephone line, let alone it goes through to the telephone exchange. 

Although yes, there's an issue, I don't see a solution proposed. If anything, it will take people time to adjust to the change (everyone expects the lower-than-advertised speeds) which will confuse people and cause a lot of man-hours wasted on sorting it all out (more calls to call centers. Tons of people working to reform the speeds they can provide based on the statistics they need to gather for an accurate appraisal, keeping this data up to date and storing it and working through it to update marketing) instead of leaving it all be. 

tl;dr The solution isn't worth anything significant and will just waste people's time, primarily in the business sector. People are used to the current overestimates, so although it can change we won't benefit much from it. Most people are close to telephone exchanges anyway, so the estimates won't change much.

--
edit:  
What matters most is contention ratios and net bandwidth load in terms of % of overall bandwidth on their ISP interconnectivity at peaks times, along with upper limits of speeds provided to lines and a simple tool provided to show what is expected from your line (http://www.dslchecker.bt.com/ for example). Last but not least, they need to show what traffic shaping is used on their products.   
These would provide an accurate and fairly straight forward estimate to what speeds you will actually get. If someone like Virgin Media posted this, they would be unable to hide their issues with traffic shaping (severely - I've seen a 90% speed increase in Virgin Media home fibre when I've used a VPN, taking it off drops the speed back down during peak times) and bandwidth on their core network. Much better for the consumer; without this detail it's simply inaccurate. You can only dumb things down so much for a consumer before the issue is really about them being willing to read up/research the issue.

The big flashing numbers of 120Mbps or whatever - this isn't something easily solved. What is necessary is to have regulations to force this key data to be provided to customers and to the general public as it's all very hidden or improbably difficult to obtain. I'd know in a heartbeat what I need when I moved house if it was available and I'd be able to help friends too.

In normal game theory, you're right. This is how it works. This is why tacit collusion is very difficult to sustain. 

When everyone has a price matching scheme, however, slashing your prices doesn't work nearly as well. Your margins take huge hit but you don't gain many customers as customers don't save any money by going to you. They can continue shopping at their favourite/nearest store and make up the difference with price matching. 

Price matching schemes therefore make it much easier to the market to sustain tacit collusion, they reduce the incentive for supermarkets to defect on the 'deal' and cut prices.

I think in the stint that Coutinho was starting ahead of Allen we were looking to attack the game quickly and directly with good incisive play and fast transitions.  Coutinho is pretty much made for that sort of thing, he's amazing at dribbling out of pressure and finding players in front of him on the move.  He is always driving forwards looking for the killer ball and forcing the game forward quickly.  Allen on the other hand is not so good at it, he favors control and a more methodical approach in possession that doesn't lend itself to the way we liked to counter last season.  Allen will keep the ball well and recycle possession like a beast, but he's not going to play the incisive ball or facilitate a fast attack up the pitch.  Allen's also much better defensively than Coutinho, as you pointed out.  The way I see it is you start Coutinho if you want to try and jump on your opponent to manhandle the game early, or Allen if you want more control over the game.

for me, with Coutinho, I think he showed last season that he does fit the diamond depending on the attitude of the team.  If we're out to kill it early he's great as a starter.  If we're not (like how we've been playing this season, albeit not in a diamond), then he should be coming off the bench.

I can't think of too many disabilities that put someone out of work for that long. In terms of developed disabilities, like limb or organ failures, there will certainly be jobs that some just *could not* work, like skyscraper window cleaner. A window cleaner who has a heart attack or bad back should definitely quit his job. And then there's congenital disabilities, such as down syndrome or heart defects or depression. Sadly, people with down syndrome are excluded from some careers.

Surely there is a job out there for all of these people? Our window cleaner could find gainful employment is a low key role somewhere.

1. Create a *new* fixed term tenancy, letting agents love to encourage this because they can charge fees for it (they spend maybe £10 total on labour for preparing and printing out a new contract) in the region of £100. Letting agents will often present this as the *only* option because it provides them with a guaranteed 6/12 month tenancy and easy money. Most people agree to pay the fee because they trust the agents. hah.

2. Revert to a periodic tenancy, this is a simple month to month tenancy that can be ended by the tenant at any time with 1 month (a full rental period) of notice or with 2 months notice by the landlord. This option is great for tenants who like flexibility and landlords rarely have a problem with it, but letting agents can't charge you for this so they'd much prefer you take option 1. This option happens **automatically** and the only thing that can happen if the agent is annoyed is an eviction, which takes months and is rarely in the landlords interest. I've never been evicted for refusing to renew and reverting to a periodic tenancy.

3. Leave

When you sign your initial tenancy agreement you're not agreeing to pay that fee in 6 months: you're agreeing that *if* you want to extend the tenancy then you will pay that fee... but you (probably) won't want to extend the tenancy to another fixed term you'll be happy with periodic, so just ignore it.

PIP isn't means tested so if you're unemployed or earn a million quid a week you can still claim it. ESA is means tested but the wait time is less.

I choose to claim PIP because I can. It's 4k-ish a year that I'd be daft not to claim purely because of an ethical reason - I know people agree/disagree with a welfare state. But at the end of the day, that is what it's there for. I'm long term unemployed, studying a degree to better myself in the hopes of earning enough to support me and my fiancee who is also a degree student.

As for the things that make me eligible for PIP, shit happens. I don't think 4k a year will magically make me better (because it won't) but I do think it'll keep my head above the water just enough to see me through my degree so I can start saving up for a house once I've got a full time job. I don't need to justify to you (nor anybody else) what I've got going on that means I can claim it.

Then according to Atkins it is running at 49 movements. If Manchester needs anything it's a terminal or more piers or to use what it has more efficiently.  Gatwick deals with more flights from one runway. Manchester has room to grow. 


And what if the Dutch government then changes its mind? Schipol is currently limited to 510,000 movements. This year it had 464,400 available and used 426,000. It doesn't have loads of growth space so we can't rely on the Netherlands for our connectivity.

PROS
- Alonso had been poor in the previous season
- Needed money to fund Barry transfer
- Barry had been very good for Aston Villa
- Barry could play many different positions in the midfield and could play left back

CONS
- Alonso could improve and prove his worth again
- Barry could flop, and not be good enough

WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN THE SUMMER?

Alonso was made available for around £18m, the two names in for him were Juventus and Arsenal, I don't think we would've ever sold to Arsenal but it was Juventus that looked the likely destination, they refused to pay £18m, so obviously they did not rate Alonso highly either.

WHAT HAPPENED AFTER?

Alonso had his best season for Liverpool and was a pivotal part of a league challenging side, he left for Real Madrid, has won numerous trophies including the league and champions league. Barry left Villa eventually, joined Man City and was a first choice midfielder when they won the league.

Obviously Alonso is twice the player that Barry is, but Alonso's resurgence in 08-09 came out of the blue, I don't care what anyone says, no-one was predicting a huge season from Alonso like that. But Barry has gone onto to be a very good player, even though hes never been in Alonso's class.

With better owners (cough FSG cough), Benitez would've just bought Barry, no need to unsettle Alonso and Alonso might've never left. Though people fail to mention that Alonso might've left for Real Madrid anyway.",0,1416335077,null,0,false,0,cm65pta,t3_2mnw0v,t1_cm65pta,t1_cm65ccl,null,1425963539,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8

I think you have to take wage structure into account when you look at the player hierarchy of the club. If player x is starting every week and making 60k per week and Joe Cole over there is making 100k a week to sit on his ass and be useless, that can cause problems. It also can be used by agents as a bargaining tool to say well Joe Cole is on this so pay my guy 280k when even Stevie was on between 120-140 (at least pre-Suarez). This is why we struggled for a while to attract quality players until we could restructure our wages and clear out all of the dead weight. So this is why I care that Glen Johnson gets a deal worth 45k per week rather than 90k.

For example you can use it to lease a very expensive custom wheelchair so you can leave your house without assistance and get to work. ESA is the benefit for people who can't work due to illness or disability, however you can earn a decent salary and still get PIP to even out the disadvantages you face that cost money. If the government stopped PIP, disabled people wouldn't be able to work and would have to go on more benefits, and would stop paying tax. That would cost the government more than helping people out a bit with extra costs.

Also there's plenty of conditions that mean someone can't work for long periods of time, I have severe chronic pain (opiods don't make it go away), frequent joint dislocations (just did my shoulder a few days ago when gravity pulled it out of it's socket), fatigue from the pain and a few secondary conditions causing autonomic nervous system problems and part of my brain is slumped down onto my spine. There's no cure for any of these and I see the best doctors in Europe for my conditions but even they can't fix it. I still feel like utter shit on a ""good"" day. I struggle to focus on tv shows, I can't even cook my own food anymore and going to my tiny tesco metro means I have to have a quiet day the following day to recover. I'm trying to get a wheelchair to see it that helps, but due to NHS cuts they can't offer me one because I can walk 20 whole metres, which is apparently not serious enough. I'll probably have to buy one myself, which is going to cost £3k or more at least.

The fraud rate for disability related benefits is only 0.7%, and that's the DWP's statistics there. It's not easy to get these benefits, I know, I've been through both with a genuine medical condition and it's taken a year of stress and fighting to get here. I'll have to go through it all again in 3 years time, with my condition unlikely to improve.

Higuain, Lacazette are very different players. Son is closer but still more of a wide forward/ss than a winger. The question comes down to who are you playing where. If you get in another striker, you have to assume either Balo or Studge isn't playing. You're not going to push Higuain onto the wing, that's a waste. Son is probably most versatile of the group.

Well done, and hopefully this leads to a productive dialogue on Thursday.

Original Post: The supporters have legitimate grievances about the treatment of fans at WHL, about consulting with them regarding the move to another stadium for a season, about prices, the ""Yids"" issue, and other essentially non-football issues. I hope they can have a productive dialogue with club on these issues, and certainly I think the club needs to be much more sensitive to the views of their supporters. 

That said, the supporters need to stay out of football stuff. That one agenda item is ""Director of football position,"" and you just know they're going to walk in there and say, ""We don't want one."" That, frankly, is armchair management. They need to let the football people--Baldini, Pochetino, the rest of the coaching staff, the players--do their jobs. They're all committed professionals, and Levy has FAR more insight into how well they're doing than the fans do, by virtue of being privy to training sessions, scouting reports, etc. 

And, while we're struggling right now, there are two overwhelming facts in terms of the on-field performance of Tottenham Hotspur in the Daniel Levy-ENIC era: first is that our median position in the Premier League table has improved from about 10th before ENIC to about 6th after. We have gone from a pretty standard mid-table club to a team attempting to break into the Premier League elite. Second is that the teams that ARE in the Premier League elite have gotten there with massive financial resources unavailable to us. We do not have a billionaire owner (nor should we desire one, for reasons which require a longer discussion), we do not have a global following or a massive new stadium (yet). As such, expecting us to continue to improve year after year and to reach consistent Champions League football is unreasonable. ENIC and Levy have done as well as anyone could reasonably expect. They've hardly been perfect and there have certainly been poor decisions with buying and selling players, manager choice, and so on. Nevertheless, there have also been some very successful moves that we should not overlook. They did get us into the Champions League once, after all, a remarkable feat by any stretch.

I worry that if the Supporters' Trust goes in there and conflates off-field and on-field issues, it will more or less give ENIC and Levy cause to ignore them, to shut down dialogue before it really begins. Those issues MUST be handled separately. After all, winning should not end the very real grievances about the lack of communication and in some cases respect between club and supporters; nor should those problems obscure what is objectively a successful record on the pitch.",0,1416337348,null,0,1416382049,0,cm671oe,t3_2momm3,t1_cm671oe,t3_2momm3,null,1425962919,9,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,9

We're not mean spirited and charitable - we just can't give as much because we don't live a life of luxury like Bob Geldof, so he believes we have to be coherced into buying a shitty CD with a shitty song to do anything. He's on his own planet.

Seeing his ""time"" as having value proves this. That making a CD of rechurned lyrics that are patronising and misinformed (""No rain or river flows"" ... The Congo River is the deepest in the world and second largest by discharge, the problems Africa faces are far more deep-rooted and complex than the trivalised 'They just need a bit of water and some food' that these lyrics present. ""Do they know it's Christmas time at all?"" Well probably since we colonised and carved up their country taking Chrisitan missionaries with us to 'civilise the natives' and as a result 500million + of the continent are Christian) proves how little effort he has put into this, and that he thinks a song will benefit Africa in anyway is a ridiculous idea.

So, no one buys the song - we're seen as ""uncharitable"" - and Bob Geldof gets his point across.

But, he doesn't see other issues happening around him. The new song has been ""rewritten"" to help Ebloa victims - and whilst it is a horrible disease and the world would be better off without it - you don't see them singing a song to raise money about what happens in the UK during winter, [with over 31,000 people dying each year.](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/subnational-health2/excess-winter-mortality-in-england-and-wales/2012-13--provisional--and-2011-12--final-/stb-ewm-12-13.html) Far more than the current total ebola toll.

What were the right positions? What core did we gut (aside from Bale, where we obviously had little choice)?

To me, the right positions were mostly in attack, since Bale was the only one performing well that season.

We *needed* a good goalscoring forward and we bought one in Soldado.

We needed to not only replace Bale, but to strengthen the attacking line in general. We got Eriksen and Lamela - two of the most exciting young players in the world! - and Chadli for depth.

Our CB pairing was in question, as Kaboul had a bad injury and Dawson was ""too slow to play a high line."" We got a faster CB who was comfortable on the ball in Chiriches.

We had a boss CM pairing in Sandro and Dembele. That core was still there. But both of them have had a history of injuries. You can't rely on that, you need more options. Paulinho was a dynamic box to box player, who could help press and get into the box to score goals. Capoue was more depth.

We needed a LB. Everyone was saying that at the time. There weren't really any good LBs in our market, but we would have done well to find someone.

I don't think Rodgers is done, we're comparing everything to last season. To be honest, I couldn't believe we were doing so well, but we did.

Then summer transfers hit and as good as we were the squad was ripped to bits, new players all the way through. We go again, but we hardly know each other. 

Suarez was not replaceable. End of.

With Sturridge and Sterling linking up, I think we'd be bothering the top four. As we should be doing.

This is going to take time, and throwing a hissy fit and booting Rodgers out the door isn't the answer.

Gerrard will likely go under Rodgers, that's going to be an issue to deal with also if results are all over the place when it happens.

&gt;
&gt;She was present when the Eleventh Doctor's TARDIS, along with both the Doctor and Clara Oswald, were brought to HQ in an effort to understand what had happened to several paintings in the Under-Gallery. The Doctor took a liking to her long multi-coloured scarf, which was strikingly similar to one he wore in his fourth incarnation. She displayed a type of hero-worship belief in the Doctor, twice ""praying"" to him to save her during moments of danger. 
&gt;On the Doctor's orders, she and fellow scientist McGillop analysed the stone dust in the undergallery under the National Gallery, and it was Osgood who realised the dust was the smashed remains of the statues that had previously occupied. She then realised with horror that their places had been taken over by the Zygons that had escaped from the paintings. She was able to escape from them, although she was duplicated by one of their number before she got away. 
&gt;She was asthmatic, and often forgot to use her inhaler when she needed to, especially when over-excited, often being reminded by Kate when she started wheezing. The Zygon who took her form disliked this, annoyed at ""getting one with a defect,"" and promptly took her inhaler. When she escaped from this Zygon by tripping it with her scarf, she reclaimed her inhaler.

Those moves are higher-risk and the failure of them to pay off to this point makes them much more damaging than say, Lewis Holtby--a low-risk player who didn't really work out for us but who still turned a profit for the club. 

I do agree that we need to scout and coordinate better, of that there's not much doubt. We don't have the resources to compete with the top clubs in buying players, as the Bale money illustrated. As such, we must find other ways to outdo them. One possibility is scouting, another is attempting to build a club that is particularly cohesive and driven in its attitude.

However, ....

Much of the reason for this is the individuals desire for maintaining the relatively peaceful status-quo. 
(And is also influenced by present day economic conditions).

That is to say the numbers would represent the intellectual reasoning of the population ... but the number would not reflect the true desire of a great many of those who voted.

(In the same way as if I asked you would you like a third slice of delicious chocolate cake. Well yes you would ... buuut you dont want to get fat and have the associated hassle ... so no thanks).

This is reflected in the identity polls which ask whether someone considers themselves Irish, or British, or Northern Irish, or more Irish than British, more British than Irish etc etc etc.

The results of such polls do not line up well with previous referendum polls. 

So you have a large discrepancy between a referendum poll which was published (and is very much overused by unionists these days)  showing only low numbers voting for a united Ireland and the identity polls showing a significantly larger number of people who say'I'm Irish not British'. 

Also to consider is the geographical aspect. 
The population of N.Ireland is more concentrated to the north east of the region and in this general direction the demographics become more unionist.
This leaves the western half of N.Ireland very nationalist. 4 of the 6 counties vote in majority for nationalist political parties. 
(all to the south/south west of the region)


Someone mentions below about the subvention money in the area of 6-7 Billion pounds coming from Great Britain (the big island), I see this as a good thing, Britain is not presently prospering from its exploits on this island, indeed it is paying money to people who want a united Ireland in many cases. 
A form of compensation for intruding into their lives perhaps.  

When you ask about whether somewhere is 'Irish' 'British' or 'Zimbabwean' you really asking about who has the official title on the world map. 

G.Britain has the official title on paper, and also the eastern side of N.Ireland is certainly British on the ground. 
The western half of northern Ireland however - there expect little loyalty to Britain (except Fermanagh perhaps) and few people considering themselves British. 

... these same people are compensated with the per capita effects of 6-7 billion of (mostly) English peoples every year.

Second rule of talking to border officers: you don't have to tell them the whole truth.

So I think in your case saying you're coming over here to visit gaming conventions is a perfectly good answer, especially if you already have pre-booked tickets or something to show that's really your intention.

However you're probably better off just saying you're staying with family friends rather than your boyfriend. If they know you have a romantic attachment to someone over here they're going to be far more inclined to think you've got an incentive to stay than if you're just staying with friends. However do make sure you've got plausible (and not made-up) answers to questions such as ""who are these friends? How did you meet them? How well do you know them?"" etc.

If you've made stuff up, then unless you're skilled at dealing with interrogations you'll almost certainly start umming and ahhing if they ask a question you hadn't pre-prepared for.  And when you find it hard to answer their questions, that's when they're likely to put a big fat ""ENTRY DENIED"" stamp in your passport and put you on the first plane home. That's why I said never, ever lie, you just can be economical with the truth if you really need to.

Their main concern (besides overstaying) will be that you have enough money to support yourself. Obviously if you're staying at friends you won't need to pay for a hotel, but try to bring as much cash and/or bank statements to prove you have cash, as possible. Even staying at friends they might well expect as much as £200 - £250 **per week** to be a reasonable amount. If you have significantly less than that in liquid funds, you could have problems gaining entry.

Your statements here are very overarching, which may have been part of the problem from the club as well.

Attack: Yes, we did need additions, but not random good attackers. We spent massively on Soldado, a player who thrived in a system based on quick vertical passing and two forwards, with one being more reserved. We brought him here to a small pitch and a lone striker system with patient, horizontal passing from midfield.

We also spent a ludicrous sum on a player of potential in Lamela who played a side where we had two wingers who were proven to be at least Prem capable, while we targeted a bargain buy from the Eredivisie while our only other left winger option was being played out of position, and poorly to boot. Lamela is clearly a good player and one we were all excited to see pull on our shirt, but in the context of other options available and against the fact we should have more aggressively addressed our left side, it was a strange decision. 

When you take the fact that Lamela and Soldado combined cost close to 60 million pounds, and we went forward with a single senior team left back, it also adds context as to the unbalance.


Midfield: Sandro and Dembele did okay because of the pace we had on the wings in Bale and Lennon. With that removed, we see the system collapse as we are continuing to see now. To compensate, we needed a more transitional player in midfield, not more of the same: more sideways playing football (Paulinho). Paulinho is dynamic *only* in his runs with the ball not at his feet, which served to make him nothing more than the deepest lying striker on the planet, as he contributed very little to buildup play. Capoue was a good buy, I was very excited about that one. I'm disappointed and surprised with how he's done this season.

CB: Chiriches was a good buy, I agree with your assessment there.

Gutting: Huddlestone, Parker, Livermore, Dawson, Defoe, and Sandro may each not have been the most awe-inspiring players, but they provided us a core of mentality to rally around that we are very much lacking at the moment. Our policy of late has been to seek players of potential without much attention to skeleton or mentality, and this unbalance has also costed us.

So yes, I said it at the time, and I say it now as we're currently seeing the evidence that we have been unbalanced in our policy both with respect to physical components of the squad and ingredients for a successful winning mentality. We fucked up, and I see no evidence to argue to the contrary. More importantly, I hope we've recognized this and are actively addressing it with steps such as bringing in Mitchell from Saints.

I doubt that's ever going to happen.

&gt; When the government provides us with the topline of where your tax goes in a format everyone can understand, you call them 'sly fucking bastards' while simultaneously asking for a further layer of data.

That's a clumsy sentence there chap. They are 'sly fucking bastards' because they have deliberately withheld breakdowns. 

&gt; The Treasury **originally planned** to show just 3% went towards unemployment benefits while much larger amounts went to children and families, elderly people and those unable to work

**Dame Anne Begg, the chair of the Commons work and pensions committee**

They however chose not to, this is not an act of great transparency it clouds the issue, it's a dirty cheap conjuring trick designed for specifically imbeciles like yourself. I'd like to think that people could be given enough credit to see a full and thorough breakdown of all figures.

I thought perhaps that is just my memory....my mates... so I did some searching through old forum topics. Came across one that had a poll: Barry or Alonso, (votes closed 7th Aug 2008 b4 season got going) Alonso had 81% of votes, so I guess I wasn't alone back then.



Few quotes from LFC fans in 2008: ""in-form Alonso is twice the player Barry will ever be."" | ""Alonso is a linch pin.He just has to be there if Liverpool are to challenge this season,"" | ""dont let xabi go i would say hes one of the best passers in the world at the moment"" | ""Barry is a fine player, but I'm worried about Alonso's reaction. He's a better player than Barry.""

Obvious these are quotes taking to fit my purpose I guess you could do the same, I just wanted to make sure I wasn't the only one annoyed back in 08. To end this,  I never wanted Barry, a decent player but a step back from our mid at the time, and I (along with lots of others) think that the major reason Alonso left was due to the disrespect he received when we were after Barry.

I do remember the imbalance of the wings being in question. It's nice that Chadli worked out, but that wasn't a sure thing. Dempsey, Gylfi, Chadli, we've played a peculiar type of left winger since AVB started experimenting with Bale.

Your assessment of Paulinho still looks better with hindsight; at the time we all saw him as the hard worker who would have an impact everywhere on the pitch. Plus, we had Eriksen in the midfield and the wide players coming inside to (theoretically) help contribute those final balls.

In fact, I disagree with the notion that having pacy traditional wingers gives you more license to retain possession in midfield. If you don't have someone to make those quick vertical passes to the wings, those abilities are nullified and they're pretty much removed from the game.

false,p_gascoigne,flair3,,"Footballers work a fuck-ton less than your average worker. Most clubs run a 2-3 hour training a day...intense trainers will do a 2x 2hours a day. 

Secondly--what a professional player today is paid is not a a reflection of their talent nor how valuable they are. 

Platini, Gascoigne, Laudrup (as three examples) were all vastly superior to players such as Lamela, Nasri, and Podolski. Yet they only got paid small fractions of what our contemporary friends get paid.

The difference is not that good players are harder to come by either. We had lots of talent back in the 80s too. What is different is that football has become privatized to a much deeper degree (of course this didn't happen through an evil conspiracy, technology facilitated this through satelite-TV). 

In this new privatized world we as fans are willing to pay ""rent"" (TV, tickets, etc.) to get to watch these footballers. 

So while in some cases talent is far below of what it once was (Hoddle vs. Ryan Mason anyone?), we are still paying far, far more than it was once worth. 

So to summarize, the players don't get paid a shit-ton because they are particularly talented. Some of them are, but lots of them are very average. They are paid so much money because SKY Sports (among many other networks) figured out how they could privatize football. That is, they have privatized the top levels of global football. As a result, because fans (like all of us on r/COYS) are ""addicted"" to watching the very best, SKY and other networks can extract rent out of our love of the game. This is what pays the wages of these players, not their exceptional talent.

EDIT: They have to work in the off-season too? Damn, they lead hard lives don't they.

false,Chrisischan,flair8,,"Thanks for the compliment, and I appreciate your reasonable and appropriately weighted response.

Don't take this wrongly, but maybe you and others you talked with at the time saw Paulinho as a hard worker who had an impact all over the pitch, but there were some including myself who I saw on Spurs boards who questioned the notion of his impact, even when he was winning honors in the Confed Cup. 

It was clear why AVB wanted him, as he worked for Brazil's sytem in that he simply moved the ball to the feet of the extremely talented wide Brazilian players, and didn't concede possession. He was also decent in the tackle. 

However, he wasn't particularly adept at making himself highly mobile to getting to more tackles than an average more reserved midfielder in a modern three CM system, and we don't have the top notch wide players who were capable of making things work in a league of ability such as the Prem. On top of this, Paulinho wasn't/isn't able to compensate with opening up play himself with transitional passing or runs. 

So sure, maybe he looked good for Brazil in their system, but some of us wondered why we were spending so much on a player who did so little to directly influence the flow of a game from a position so responsible for doing so.

I never said traditional wingers give you more license to retain possession in midfield. I implied that the pace and width they established allowed Sandro and Dembele the space to be effective, which to me is according to the obligations of the central midfielder positions, and IMO that is primarily flow and influence. I'm not advocating the use of traditional wingers, but since we've moved to inverted wingers we've since seen the literally collapse centrally on a system consisting of our collection of primarily physical midfielders without much athleticism and transitional sense. As a result, we see what we're seeing now with a very rigid, collapsed system with little to open back up channels. 

On your take of the left wingers, I completely agree. We've often used the position lately as a pigeonhole for playing goal-scoring players out of position just to keep them on the pitch. Left wing though in the modern game, especially with use of inverted wingers, is a vital position that we have criminally overlooked. Chadli has done well, but even so he doesn't score his goals from the wide position. He often just finds space in the compacted box and uses good finishing to get the job done (this is why I think we should move him to striker, and bring in more influential pace at the left wing spot). But anyway, I agree that we've been very peculiar with the position, and it's costed us immensely since 2013.

Heathrow is obviously a major international hub airport and continued investment in it is important. I think the article is more angling for the fact that this increased expenditure on infrastructure in general isn't really helping anybody in the UK directly unless they live in London.  

And regarding your point with the trains, going through London is a ball ache and is best avoided. It involves changes and waiting around, often including having to negotiate the underground system. It's not terribly cheap to do it and it certainly takes a non-trivial amount of time. Yes I can get a train from London to pretty much anywhere, but I would rather not. While booking my flights for a holiday this winter I ruled out any of the London airports due to travel times. I currently live near Coventry and despite London being geographically slightly closer, it was far more convenient to fly from Manchester or Liverpool due to rail connections.

________

One particular problem with your line of argumentation here is that it can be applied to any particular issue brought up to highlight the issues that women face. Complaining about a sexy shirt? Well that's trivial: we just landed on a comet! Complaining about being told they can't drive properly? Fuss over nothing. Women not paid as much as men for sport? Women in some countries aren't even allowed to play - get your priorities in order!

A very significant factor in sexism etc. in society is that it's not just ""one thing"" but a myriad of small issues that roll into one big one. Taylor's shirt, his choice of comment and the fact that he thought those things would be ""OK"" to say on a live TV stream (I should point out that I'm not saying that he should have been barred from saying what he wanted to) are all part of the problem. You can't tackle the big one without taking on the little ones.

On a related note: what makes you (a man, I'm guessing? I am too, for the record) think that you are the arbiter of what women should find important, in their efforts to push back against inherent sexism and the surrounding issues? Why do you get to decide what they should or should not complain about?",0,1416351723,null,0,1416352391,0,cm6fdtr,t3_2mo7kw,t1_cm6fdtr,t1_cm68bux,null,1425958958,-4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-4

Picture this: 

~~X years time~~ (let's say 3-- three is a good number). 3 years time. Everton have just won the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup, and that highly-prestigious International Guinness Cup that has eluded all of the other greatest teams in history. Barkley and Lukaku are the greatest duo in the history of the sport. John Stones just won a Nobel Peace Prize for all his charity work. Tim Howard's beard has grown so long he uses it as another appendage and blocks shots on its own. Messi is seen stalking around Goodison so he can try and get Naismith's autograph. Kone unzips his kit to reveal a black suit. Turns out he's been an undercover agent for the CIA this whole time. His mission: to take down FIFA. He's successful. Turns out most of the embezzlement was laundered through the Arteta money or some such manner-- unbeknownst to Kenwright. The 2018 World Cup is immediately awarded to England and 2022 World Cup is immediately awarded to the United States. To redeem himself Sepp Blatter spends most of his corruption money to renovate Goodison in under a month in the offseason with no disruption. There's some leftover money, even after he gives money to Stones' charity. So he announces that the leftover money will be divided among the subscribers of /r/Everton. Then, at the end of it all, as they're handing out that final trophy, the Queen hands Roberto Martinez the microphone. He picks it up ready to give that speech he's had in his mind since he took this job:

&gt; *Called it.*

&gt; *Nil satis nisi optimum, mother fuckers* 

&gt; \**Drops mic**

Then he whistles. Joel Robles comes running out of nowhere and puts Martinez on his shoulders. With just a spur from his lovely brown-shoes, they ride off into the sunset.

So as not to dry your skin out further, you'd be best with a cleansing oil, melting gel or a rich cream not a foaming cleanser.

Which type you choose would be largely personal taste, the oils and creams are more moisturising, the gels cleansing without stripping. Any of these you can use with a muslin cloth or microfibre cloth and warm water to get a little gentle exfoliation without adding another product/ more ingredients. They all have emulsifiers which means you should not end up with greasy feeling skin.

[Here is the cleanser reviews thread,] 
(http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/comments/2icnkb/the_cleanser_reviews/) there are also bits and pieces of discussion on cleansers elsewhere on the sub. The most popular rich creamy cleanser has been Superdrug Vitamin E Hot Cloth Cleanser, and of the cleansing oils L'Oreal Skin Perfection 15 Second Miracle Cleansing Oil.

I am the only one who has rated melting cleansing gels at this point - the NSPA at Asda Skin Renewal Gel is the nicest to use and supposedly very lightly exfoliating, Tesco Pro Formula Radiance Melting Gel Cleanser has fewer ingredients, seems very gentle but doesn't smell or look as nice.",0,1416352085,null,0,1416352333,0,cm6fkgs,t3_2mpfli,t1_cm6fkgs,t3_2mpfli,null,1425958872,6,false,SkincareAddictionUK,t5_32evd,6

Fitting in with what I said about cleansers: NSPA at Asda have some lovely to use moisturisers, I have the Night Repair Cream and the Ultra Hydrate Cream, both of which supply many of the substances found in out own skin that help keep us moisturised. Both will work for day or night they are not greasy.

If you cannot get to an Asda then Superdrug Vitamin E night cream has a good ingredients list similar to one of the NSPA  creams, I've just ordered it myself. The Vitamin E line is on BOGO half price at Superdrug, and NSPA at Asda seem to be on a permanent round of offers so you are not likely to pay more than a fiver for anything. So if you don't like something just use it up for your body!

Now there's your hindsight. Chadli has only come good this season after a previous one of only scoring one domestic league goal, while Lennon at the time had yet to cause any concern and Townsend was just coming off a breakthrough loan stint in the league. Hell, Townsend scored twice as many goals in those 12 games with a relegated QPR than Chadli did in his whole season with a Spurs side that finished sixth. So *at the time*, it was a move that justifiably caused questions to arise for some who weren't gaga-ing over his youtube compilations.

So yes, I maintain even despite Chadli's success (scoring striker's goals, and I think he should be moved there) left wing was more of a concern at the time and deserved more attention.

ESA is basically JSA without having to go to the jobbie once a week and meet some fuck-headed advisor. You do need a sick note though - go to your GP, get one (max is 3 months) then cancel your JSA claim, reapply over the phone for ESA then they'll ask for proof of your sick note. Post it off, job done. The way I was told was if you aren't fit for work, you can't be on JSA (sort of in the name, really). I was on JSA but was medicated up the wazoo for depression so they told me I had to sign off and go on ESA. Thankfully I've got a decent GP who just signed me off for it and there was no hassle. It's not a different rate money wise but it means you don't have to job search and that's a load off if not anything else.

 [**Mirroring (psychology)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirroring%20%28psychology%29): [](#sfw)

&gt;

&gt;__Mirroring__ is the behaviour in which one person copies another person usually while in [social interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation) with them. It may include miming [gestures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesture), movements, [body language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_language), muscle tensions, expressions, tones, [eye movements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_movement_(sensory\)), breathing, tempo, [accent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accent_(dialect\)), [attitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology\)), choice of words or [metaphors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor), and other aspects of [communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication). It is often observed among couples or close [friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendship).

&gt;Mirroring is the subconscious replication of another person's nonverbal signals.  This concept takes place in everyday interactions, and often goes unnoticed by both the person enacting the mirroring behaviors as well as the individual who is being mirrored. The activation of mirror neurons takes place within the individual who begins to mirror another's movements, and allows them a greater connection and understanding with the individual who they are mirroring, as well as allowing the individual who is being mirrored to feel a stronger connection with the other individual. Mirroring is distinct from imitation in under the premise that while imitation is a conscious and overt effort to copy another person, mirroring is often covert and goes unnoticed within the situation.

&gt;The display of mirroring often begins as early as infancy, as babies begin to mimic individuals around them and establish connections with particular body movements.  The ability to mimic another person's actions allows the infant to establish a sense of empathy and thus begin to understand another person's emotions. The infant continues to establish connections with other individual's emotions and subsequently mirror their movements.

* At the same time as shoving half of Britain's school leavers through university, he introduces tuition fees - suddenly, people who couldn't afford school fees are being railroaded into a university system where they *have* to afford fees, else they're going nowhere in life

Plus, 1/3 of the population is concentrated in the south-east, combined with south wales, most of the midlands and the south west also being vastly closer to London than the north, so a strong airport in london affects a greater proportion of the country. The north + scotland is a large area with a spread out population, but even the north can easily get to London via road/train pretty fast.

People in physics generally care about outreach, equality and diversity nowadays.  There's a very painful awareness that the field is still extremely male-dominated and that men are (generally inadvertently) given lots of unfair advantages, harming both aspiring female scientists and science itself.  The comments made by Taylor and the shirt he wore were *obviously* inappropriate: they helped reinforce the view that physics is unfriendly to women, and they spoiled both an important scientific event *and* a very important outreach opportunity.  Some people criticised him, he apologised, and that should have been the end of it.

Probably not but I think it depends on context. Chelsea are currently playing the style of football that I think Abramovich always wanted. It's a fluid and aesthetically pleasing attacking style which is generating results, really he couldn't ask for anything more in that way. If Chelsea lose the PL title due to a failure of the style or tactics than Mourinho will likely be out the door but if it comes down to a bunch of unlucky injuries I could see him staying. There's no question that he has made the team stronger and better than it has been since the last time he was at the club and he did it all in just over a year. His business and tactics have been stellar and I think Abramovich must appreciate that.

There was always a valid reason why we let them go. No other big team with ambitions would have kept clueless managers like Scolari and Andre Villas-Boas.

Fair is fair. But in some industries, like ours, they are underdogs. Although I would argue their opportunities are higher in IT because of biased employers and stats fillers.

&gt;Run any obviously male-centric events of this nature and you'll be P45'd for sexism and misconduct.

Well I'd hope you'd just get laughed at rather than anything taken seriously. I can't wait for that unfair dismissal case though, especially if the corporation had run a female event previously.

&gt;I also work in IT and any girls that come into technical jobs are paraded around as examples and how we're supposed to be ""very proud"" of them.

Honestly, you should. I am. Not for overcoming any inherent disadvantage they have as I believe they probably had extra advantages, but for putting up with all the b/s that comes with getting there in the first place. Can you imagine what being the sole female CS student is like? I'm all for realising there is little to no difference between the sexes, but it remains that they are underrepresented in our field for whatever reason. A reason it would be nice to correct.

&gt;The internal comms at my company goes out of the way to ensure that women always top the bill whenever there are articles about prize winning, successful corporate events and personal achievements etc.

Point that shit out. Document it, prove it! It isn't on.

Of course, nothing of what I say is to detract from your original point which is quite correct. But that is the effects of being a celebrated minority.

If you're still not sure It might be worth doing the CBT which stands for Compulsory Basic Training It normally costs about £130 if you don't have your own bike, It involves you and maybe one or two other novices with an instructor having a day of training on a bike or scooter, with half the day off the road learning how to control the bike, road positioning, safety checks etc then If the instructor is happy your going to be safe he/she will take you out on the road for the other half of the day just riding around. As long as you don't see it as a test (because it's not, if you have a problem ask the instructor that's why their there!!!) it's a really fun day.

In regards to the A2 License the prices they quote are normally their worst case scenario so they tend to be in the £800s mark this price would be taking somebody who has never even sat on a motorcycle all the way to having the license, so it includes the CBT, Bike hire and 20 or so lessons. You don't have to do it this way the CBT lasts for 2 years so you have plenty of time to have a 125 for a year and see how you go.

This isn't an issue of maxing out the bandwidth, or maxing out the capacity of the router - but rather an issue of buffering of data down the line. Streaming of iPlayer (~ 1,500kbps for decent quality stream ) can render another laptop sharing the connection unable to refresh a simple website, even if a speed-test shows a healthy 30 meg capacity.

Again, this isn't strictly bandwidth, there are other more technical issues at play. In my opinion, this will be the next big thing to annoy consumers as they realise a shared connection suffers disproportionately with more users.


*EDIT
This link explains the issue. My home connection suffers from it pretty heavily - &gt;1700ms of buffering, which is certainly noticeable.

Sure, it's impressive what he did, taking a newly promoted team to 11th in the league, something not since accomplished until the next season when Southampton finished 9th.

We've seen time and again that mangers have a cap for how good they'll be. Like Hodgson, a great mid-table or relegation club manager, but shit at the other end of the table.

false,madeinacton,null,null,"It is a crappy policy for a lot of reasons, but not necessarily the ones that she mentions. 

1) its a bureaucratic nightmare, the amount of time effort and money it will cost to put into place, deal with appeals and keep on top of - surely there's an easier way to raise revenue from rich people. Why not just put a higher level of stamp duty or increase a another tax elsewhere.

2) It will completely distort the London property market. Houseshare rents in large properties will go up to account for this or these properties will just get taken off the rental market, forces prices up even more. Either way it will have a knock on effect of rent increasing across the board around the city, hitting the poorest (i.e the 8 people to a house share) the hardest.  

3) It's likely to hit families more than any other group, single rich people can buy a nice little 1 bed flat for 1.5 million, whilst a family with 5 kids that's asset rich but on a non rich persons wage will likely have it tied up in a taxable property.

4) It does not take into account the amount of debt people are having to service or the amount they are having to stretch to afford living where they are. 
Typical scenario would be my uncle, his wife inherited her mothers house and used the money combined with a mortgage around 12 years ago and stretched themselves to buy a nice 4 bed house with a garden in zone two. They earn a fairly good wage of around 90k between them, but still have a big mortgage and three kids to support in London. Should they be paying a shit ton more tax than a  single banker living in 1.5m batchelors pad paid for with one years bonus in cash? 

5) It will probably be counter productive as people will stop doing conversions, extensions, renovations and deliberately keep their properties at a lower value to avoid going over the threshold. Buy to let investors will avoid all large properties bringing the prices down as its better to buy two properties with 3 beds each than one with 6, meaning lower demand, lower prices and less stamp duty brought in.

6) It will be a disincentive to rich people relocating here and encourage some to relocate, meaning lower total tax take.

7) It will encourage developers to convert even more family homes into flats, this is at a time when we have a huge shortage of family homes in the city and make them even rarer, pushing prices and demand higher and forcing them to live elsewhere. This will also put even more strain on the councils ability to house larger families on benefits and will likely result in them shipping them out of the city. 

8) Continually taxing a static asset is not good economics or fair in a any way and has a very harsh lifetime cost, especially with a sharp cut off. I.e my house might be worth 1.9m and I pay no tax over 30 years, someone elses is worth 2m and they pay 90k worth of tax. 

9) It won't actually bring that much money in, considering the amount of stress and difficulty it will cause. 

10) The only reason it's been created is because it makes good rhetoric and Milliband wants to convince everyone by hitting the rich as hard as he's on your side. 

I'm pretty sure there are a million other arguments explaining why this is a retarded policy. 

Disclosure: I do not live in ""Mansion"", in fact I'm unemployed and have nothing to lose if this goes through. I just thinks it's poorly thought out and there are better ways to gain more revenue from rich people.

* Then upgrade with a poached egg on top.

* Also try cheese on toast with the Marmite under the cheese. Gosh, that's good.

* Also works on cheese crackers with or without cheese. Similarly try it on anything bready like a bagel.

* Smear it on sticks of raw veg (like crudites) to make them palatable.

* Add it to a white sauce for pasta.

* Add it sparingly to anything you might add soy sauce to like a stir-fry or other salty sauce.

* Try [Marmite chocolate](http://www.amazon.com/Very-Peculiar-Marmite-Chocolate-Pack/dp/B005FE1QTK)
