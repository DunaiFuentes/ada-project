### ONE.

Not only does Earth have one moon, there is only one object in the universe called ""Moon"", and it is the large rocky natural satellite of Earth. Natural satellites may be called ""moons"" in common parlance, but for astronomers the Moon is the only Moon that exists. Same goes with Sun - there is only one Sun in the universe. The Sun is a star, and there are lots of stars, but only one Sun. The Moon is a satellite, and many satellites exist, but only one is called Moon.

For a slightly less pedantic answer that doesn't involve the semantic definition of the word moon - that is to say, if the question was ""how many natural satellites does the Earth have"", the answer is **STILL ONE.**

All other objects that have been listed by QI as ""moons"" orbit the SUN. ALL OF THEM. EVERY. FUCKING. ONE. There are objects captured at Earth's Lagrange points, there are objects in resonant orbits with the Earth, but there is one, count em, one natural satellite that orbits the Earth and the Earth alone.",0,1391405528,null,0,false,0,cf5pw6e,t3_1wsuuc,t1_cf5pw6e,t1_cf57pij,null,1432229108,21,false,quiteinteresting,t5_2rfzr,21

It seems like you're coming up with non-existant issues. I don't think this sort of thing would ever happen.

The age conundrum is probably a more reasonable example. What you're suggesting is that if at any point the new series contradicts the age the Doctor stated he was in the classic series, then we should disregard that in favour of what was said in the classic?

I've never meant to step on any toes. I was asked to make something by an unknown person and I was doing my best to make them smile, even if it was for just one moment. I've taken the Firefly stuff down, as people were right, it wasn't mine. The line art wasn't mine. I didn't know much about Firefly and that was one of the first things I found online. I thought it was cool, so I used it. It wasn't from any Firefly site. It was from some sticker site.

Is this the Original?(http://www.texasartcat.com/bluesun.html)

There are times when it's impossible to find out where something originated on the internet. QMX's is completely different (http://store.qmxonline.com/Serenity-in-Flight-Bumper-Sticker_p_112.html)
As for the badge, yes it is the same, but it isn't mimicking the metal label look. There wasn't a line version of that, so I made it myself. That's right, took my time and remade it. It's not a direct copy, but a remade, different version in a different medium.

Either way, they have both been taken down.

I'll also note, however, that female comedians are hilarious when they avoid the pitfalls detailed in that question's discussion from the episode—pitfalls like writing their routines and responding to comedic prompts by treating themselves as a minority when in fact they're 50% of the population, by telling only jokes that relate to them being female and/or them behaving in the stereotypical manner and doing sexist stereotypical things, and by being overly sensitive in a comedic setting.

A huge majority of female comedians go through their entire careers playing a ditzy girl (so unfunny that I can't even remember the name of the unfunny ""princess"" type comic I'm thinking of), a fat/ugly/promiscuous woman (Jo Brand, Lisa Lampinelli), or by having all their material revolve around men and their interactions with them.

In short, all the good female comics (and some of them are the best out of both genders) are comics who tell jokes like a male comedian would (excluding male comedians which adhere to the same schticks above)...Tina Fey, Sarah Silverman, Amy Poehler, there's plenty.

But since we're talking about QI and your accusation that I only like male guests on QI, here are some of my favorites in descending order of hilarity: Katherine Ryan, Sara Pascoe, Jan Ravens, Sarah Millican...I could go on but I feel that's more than enough examples.

true,TheCorpulentGrape,lfcflame,,"Taking it in the context of the season as a whole it's really not a devastating result.  Not compared to ones like the Southampton loss at home or the Hull loss away.  We should be winning these games and you would expect the team to try and win every game but you have to account for these draws throughout the season, at least it was an away game, against a relatively gritty side that may/may not be invigorated by a new manager, and 1 point gained on the corresponding fixture last season.

Still, I think it's the manner of the draw that disappoints most. At the end of the first half I feel as if most of us thought we'd get a second within a matter of time, and from there the floodgates could really open.  But Mel made a decent tactical switch to 4-4-2 and seemed to get his side to press more which, away from home, the crowd on our back, did seem to unsettle us.  Still, we resisted and were not undone by this pressure but rather by a sloppy pass (taken advantage of by the pressure, of course.)

A draw was probably a fair result but we looked on course to win that game in the way United would in seasons past - not playing all too well or convincingly, but just getting luck to go our way.  Luckily only Everton gained on us this weekend, but yes, we did miss out on establishing a cushion for the Arsenal game.  More rests on that result than would be the case had we won, but we're going to have to start winning these games anyway if we are to establish ourselves as a Top 4 side, we can't rely on luck alone.  The Everton result last Tuesday did show we're capable, however.  Bring on Arsenal.",0,1391407395,null,0,false,0,cf5qj6y,t3_1wvba7,t1_cf5qj6y,t3_1wvba7,null,1432229453,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

Obviously they've hardly played together, but it's an interesting difference between, say, Seamus and McCarthy or even Deulofeu.

This is not exactly true.  [This was the letter she wrote the day after the confession on the 6th.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1570225/Transcript-of-Amanda-Knoxs-note.html)  

From Knox's letter""In regards to this ""confession"" that I made last night, I want to make clear that I'm very doubtful of the verity of my statements because they were made under the pressures of stress, shock and extreme exhaustion.""

How is this not a retraction?  No, she didn't say ""Lumumba was 100% not involved"", but the reason she gave was:

""I have been told there is hard evidence saying that I was at the place of the murder of my friend when it happened. This, I want to confirm, is something that to me, if asked a few days ago, would be impossible.""
So if you look at it from the perspective that you don't believe that the police would willfully lie to you and the police tell you that in fact they have hard evidence that you were at the crime scene, how would you be able to reconcile this?  The interpreter in her testimony admits telling Amanda a story of how in traumatic situation, sometimes you mind blocks things out.   

The reason Lumumba even came up was the ""See you later"" text, which was clearly misinterpreted by the police as evidence that she was meeting up with Lumumba:
""Now I remember to have also replied with the message: ""See you later. Have a good evening!"" and this for me does not mean that I wanted to meet him immediately. ""

true,JimmySevere,eng-berkshire,Berkshire,"&gt;Because the supervising staff time is free and the workfare guy is capable of producing work at the quality and speed of a full time experienced employee from day 1....

You've said this a couple of times itt as if it's even relevant. No one is claiming that a person on workfare would be able to do the tasks as efficiently as someone who'd been in the job for a year. However, the normal practice is to hire someone and they improve efficiency on the job. Why should the public foot the bill for someone working and training specifically for your company? Especially when there's no guarantee of a job at the end of it.

This is also under the assumption that the skills required for these positions take a while to learn. I don't know if you're aware that there are temping agencies where a person can be sent to work in a kitchen washing pots for a couple of days before being sent to stack shelves the next day. As far as the companies hiring know, these temps are inexperienced, however it is still worth their while hiring. The job is such that a temp can learn it suitably in one day to provide the cover they're after. These temp jobs are paid, not well paid, but paid.

I know numerous people who have been forced into workfare and similar schemes. For each of them it was a case of working for a major retail chain (Bhs, Asda, Tesco, Poundland to name a few) who had no intention of hiring anyone at the end of it but instead simply exploit the free labour being offered to them. As soon as one person's placement was at an end, drop them and get another. The job prospects from such a position are next to nil. The skills gained (if there are any) are generally unsuitable or useless. The job prospects for other unemployed people in the area are undermined. Further, people working at these companies jobs are also undercut and undermined.

At the end of the day, the company is getting an amount of work out of you at no cost to them when if they needed that job done, they should have hired and paid someone.",0,1391419102,null,0,false,0,cf5t8o5,t3_1wtrgn,t1_cf5t8o5,t1_cf5dkwh,null,1432230673,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

And yet you suggest the science against hydraulic fracturing that the general public sees is independent? Are you sure about that?

I fully accept that there is plenty of good science suggesting fracking is dangerous. 
But the general public rarely see it.
The evidence they do see is unfortunately just as bias as the 'poor' science that is for fracking. It's generally from organisations like Friends of the Earth - If you think they don't have an agenda you are crazy.

They couldn't test the tactics, nor could they be sure that the enemy wasn't planning to use them and that wouldn't be brutally effective against them. Even the best military minds at the time couldn't have predicted that they could feasibly lose 60,000 men in a single attack.

Tactics got adapted on the fly, brand new methods of warfare were created and as the war went on, increasingly advanced battle plans were created an enacted.

I have joined up on Goodreads and their reading challenge. Challenging myself to 20 books this year.

In the last 3/4 months I have manged:

[*I Am Malala*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17851885-i-am-malala) - Absolutely brilliant into the insight of living in Pakistan and the effects of the Taliban on real people in the area. Very inspiring and a reality check of how lucky we are to be able to go to school male or female. 

*[Alex Ferguson: My Autobiography](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18588024-alex-ferguson)* - Really wasn't what it could have been. An insight to what made the man a great manager would have been nice. But instead he touched on subjects he had no need to, attacked Rafa and brought up a few old gripes that most of the details we already knew. Just seemed nothing new. For any football fan worth a brief read through, but don't expect too much.

*[I am Zlatan Ibrahmovic](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16136044-i-am-zlatan-ibrahimovic)* - Now this book was excellent, opinionated and you get a better understanding of Zlatans genius, fight and why he is such an arrogant twat. But I thought likable. You did genuinely get a insiders look in this book what he thought about people around him and personalities that have molded Zlatan. 

[*A Game of Thrones*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13496.A_Game_of_Thrones) - I don't think there is many that haven't watched the TV show. I had and thought, what better way to get myself stuck into some novels. A fantastic read. I enjoyed that I had in my head an idea of who the characters where in the TV series and the novel really just brought the world more to life for me. I got a better sense of depth of the character and a better idea of the politics and goings on, especially of the smaller houses. It was a massive read for me and I am taking a rest until I go to the second one, but really enjoyed it.

[*The Simpsons and Their Mathematical Secrets by Simon Singh*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17287021-the-simpsons-and-their-mathematical-secrets) - Now I love The Simpsons and Futurama, I basically grew up watching it. Especially since my dad was one of the first people to adopt Sky TV. I never knew there was anything going on in the background with maths. Not a subject I had too much love for at school where I gained my C at GCSE after re-taking it in sixth form college. But I have a better love for numbers now and gave this a go and really enjoyed it. A mixture of behind the scenes at The Simpsons and stories of maths as well as an very easy to understand explanation of the maths that can be found in the show. I can't pretend that I understood or could recite all I read, but I did enjoy reading it.

Just currently reading a novel of the year The Ocean at the [End of The Lane by Neil Gaiman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15783514-the-ocean-at-the-end-of-the-lane) - So far so good, I am enjoying the way he has written and the feeling of building the main character as a 7 year old with no friends. I have not go too far yet and I am just starting to get to the weird goings on. 

All in all I dont think I am doing too badly in my pursuit to read more.

Er...where did I say that? As stated I pointed out that MS were using the popularity of their products as an excuse, which it wasn't and so unsurprisingly they lost. Not getting away with using that fact as an excuse doesn't change it to not being a fact. I personally never understood why they went after browsers and Windows Media Player - I would have forced them to open up more fundamental stuff like NTFS first. But hey, what do I know? :-)

&gt;Do you want to maybe review what you've posted btw, you're projecting like crazy.

Why? Is it that hard for you to follow? It certainly seems to be, but if you don't undestand an answer, ask some questions instead of joining different answers together in order to attack - it's obvious and makes you look like an idiot.

&gt;No-one said volunteers were as good a contractors 

You appear to be doing exactly that - or are you accepting that your opinions that don't gel with large-scale real-world experiences might *just* be slightly a) skewed, b) out of date and c) up your own ass?

&gt;(although now you mention it, that can be the case)

Sure. That happens *everywhere*.

&gt;and no-one wanted to know what projects you have on your cv

Actually, er, you did - then changed tack once it wasn't in your favour. What was that you were saying about reviewing what you've posted?

&gt;You made all that up.

*Sure* I did. I guess the rollout I'm doing now (that I already mentioned) is imaginary too, and that I'm in no way waiting for a 2008R2 server build to finish patching whilst responding to ignorant evangelists on reddit :-) But go on, do fill me in on your expertise with SCCM2012R2, SCOM or other large-scale tools. You will, of course, know all about them.

&gt;And loving how you're backtracking like crazy.

Really? Your replies are light on info/ experience and heavy on attack - the former you asked for, the latter you've opted for instead of giving real information. Or do you now consider picking apart your mixing up of my replies instead of providing real information 'backtracking'?

&gt;You're the one who brought Linux into the thread 

That's right. It has a bearing.

&gt;and you're the one who stated that short term costs meant it wasn't value for money

No, I stated it wasn't value for money long-term either, with examples. Do try to keep up.

&gt;yet now you use that as an excuse to keep using MS

Ah, because sites need *an excuse* to keep using MS now, right? You could have told me nothing about your experience, and yet someone I magically managed to work out how little you actually have before you demanded details (while skipping over your own). It's almost as if I do it for a living or something.

Start being honest, stop pretending, and start learning comprehension - I can carry on correcting your assumptions and deliberate stalling, but it's already clear that you'll quite happily carry on digging based on your own misconceptions and ignorance. Don't give up, though -

Oh, and it's not exactly like we pay nothing in tax already. Tax is my biggest household expense by quite some way. Circa 50% of our income goes on tax after NI, Income, Council, VAT, Excise, Road, and a myriad of other taxes are included. Since the NHS is now mostly funded by the general tax pot - there's no saying that a 2-5% increase in tax would go to the NHS. You'd find taxation would increase and you'd still get the same mostly 'meh' care.

The town of Loughborough is also very small and there didn't seem to be much to do.

If you are determined to look into this, look at SEIS for tax efficient investment in startups, **and do it with imaginary money first**. See how good you actually are.  

Definitely clear the loan, and leave your student loan. Is your student loan one of the slightly older ones at 1.5%?

Having a decent house deposit makes sense. Keep that money somewhere safe.

Look at investing in index funds (they track whole markets). Up to ~12k per year can be put away very efficiently in S&amp;S ISAs, so you could get quite a bit away before the April deadline and have possibly 21k (24 - the 3k in your cash isa) somewhere you won't have to pay capital gains on.

Get an **independent** financial advisor, one who you pay a flat rate to. They'll know more about efficiently putting your money away &amp; be able to gauge your tolerances to risk, overall life plans/etc.

Whilst the nurse looks after 2,000 patients a  year, and gets paid around 20-30k, meaning she gets £10-15 per patient she looks after at little risk to herself. So considering the needs she satisfies, and how important they are, she is actually paid 500x more per person's needs she has satisfied.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;Bit bored of your ""No you are"" answers.

You don't recognise corrections, now? You're the one generating negative responses, in most cases where you've already cheated in order to create outrage (if it's a slow afternoon, I'll quote them for you). Maybe you should start taking information seriously instead of complaining about how many mistakes you've already made (and have been corrected on) just in this thread. Do you really think you're the first person I've dealt with that, when the limits of their knowledge are reached, resorts to attack/ abuse instead of asking real questions?

&gt; You said yourself that you're forced to use whatever a business already has

No, I was illustrating why one has to go with what the rest of the world is using. not what a business already has. If you're bored, you need to start quoting, it'll save you a whole bunch of wasted frothing while I highlight yet again that you're avoiding the real issues, preferring to complain (and then complain when your complaining is corrected).

&gt;The gov are moving to open formats

No, they are not - certainly not any time soon. To really make this announcement, they would have to be bumping up NHS, Council, Police etc. IT systems with the budget to do so - which of course, they aren't going to do and don't have the money facilitate even if they wanted to. As I stated elsewhere, this sounds more like the Gov. trying to get a discount from MS. But hey, I'm making all this up, right?

&gt;and you then reply to a perfect reasonable post by someone else that it's unworkable.

That is correct - most posts are perfectly reasonable. They don't stop being so just because you don't agree.

&gt;So now you're stating it's not value for money for long term either? 

Err...yes, several posts ago - it's common knowledge, lots and lots of sites have done scoping excercises around this in the past, and they've all come to the same conclusion - no money saved, lots of money lost, no tangible benefit. I'd broaden the point, to illustrate how this isn't limited to just Office (again, an examination done by many, many sites), but you don't seem to cope very well when I do that.

&gt;What examples did you have, apart from what everyone around you is doing?

Training, Migration, there's a whole host of costs. Go ask someone else, it can be anyone with 20-odd years of experience - you can tell them they're making it all up too.

&gt;See that's exactly your problem

Ah, it's still *my* problem, then. I can see why you got out, the industry must have been overwhelmed with your fingerpointing.

&gt;you state one thing (you have to work with what you're given) and then post something contradictory.

That's because I never said what you've quoted in brackets. I said 'you have to work with what *everyone else is using*'. You then decided that government can dictate what everyone in contact with them uses (which would be the ultimate outcome), and I had to point out that that's not really how it works (and how trying that approach will cost serious £). Shall we count how many times you've misquoted now? If you knew what you were talking about, you wouldn't be doing this.

&gt;You seem to be doing a fine job arguing with yourself.

I'm sure anyone reading this exchange will come to that exact conclusion....somehow. And that's before we get to your definition of 'arguing'; One has to put a sustainable viewpoint forward to have one of those, and you haven't actually gotten that far yet, which is in itself impressive.

&gt;Yes you are backtracking a great deal

Quotes where I did this, please.

&gt;and picking apart a sentence into two or more pieces

When you spout that much guff in one scentence, usually combined with a complete retraction of what you said only one post ago (why do you think I'm taking great care to quote you?), followed by complaints based on stiching two of my replies together (and even then get them wrong), that's what happens. This is new to you? 

&gt;so that you can score imaginary goals is indeed what you're doing instead of addressing what you said to begin with. 

You'd better start quoting then, so I won't have to keep correcting you (I guess accuracy is just boring for you as well). And 'goals'? You *still* think it's a competition, when the race was over *decades* ago. But of course, time has stood still since you quit, right?

&gt;You still haven't stated your experience btw

This is an excellent example. Yes, I have, at which point you decided it was a 'pissing contest' and 'jargon'. You don't seem to have realised - the onus is on *you* now to prove why and how all these companies, councils and so on got it wrong. Maybe they just haven't brought in enough volunteers.

&gt;what 8-10 years tops?

You'd have to go back to 1988. Started on PC's once they were replacing typewriters, so that would be 1990/ 1991. Started on servers around 1995/96. Started contracting in 2004. Based on your replies, you don't seem to realise that it's a bit late to still be partying like it's 1999.

&gt;I wouldn't even know because all you do is talk about sitting around on your arse after changing a bit of software

So...you really *don't* know anything about SCCM/ SCOM, then - you only had to say. But since that seems to be the ignorance-is-knowledge path you're taking - yes, installing a server is 'changing a bit of software'....and computers are all the same, they just have different switches. You might have to speak up, I'm not sure I can hear you from the bottom of that hole you've dug yourself.

&gt;seeing what happens after someone else has done all the planning. Big deal.

Somehow I feel like we're going to set up like we did vs Liverpool and try to press them from up high, force the errors and take hold of the game.

Every team that's gone to the Etihad has tried to shut down City by playing deep, defensive football, yet they average 4 goals per home game. We need to try something different, I'm afraid that if we try the same tactics we did vs Utd or Arsenal, we won't be as successful as we were then.

Let's play our best players, get physical, and play City at their own game. We have just as much attacking talent as they do, and we have it in us to put 3 or 4 behind their shaky defence.

Traditionally, subtitles are typed live onto a [stenograph](http://videocourtrecording.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/stenomachine.jpg).

More recently, voice recognition is used where the subtitlist reads back what has been said into a headset, and the computer does the rest.

Both these systems spell words based on sound as opposed to letters, which means that similar-sounding words can sometimes get mixed up - Hence Horse and Whores.

He starts off going on about how this new chinese missile is really scary blah blah and then he mentions that the Harpoon, *a missle designed in 1965* works the same way. The harpoon itself is a copy of a soviet missile design from the 1960s. So for his article to true, you have to believe that in the last 49 years, we've developed no defences whatsoever for a known technology, possessed by a known enemy against whos systems were being activly developed for the best part of 30 years. 


He also claims there is no defence for warships against a high speed balistic missile, which 5 mins of googling proves false - [Since 2010 such capability has been deployed on over 20 US warships alone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegis_Ballistic_Missile_Defense_System#Deployment). As well as that, [the elevation of almost all current CIWS systems is 88 degrees, more than enough to target ballistic inbounds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-in_weapon_system)


He's also conveniently ignoring a few facts such as that carriers dont go sailing around the ocean on their own looking for fun - they are part of a battle group. Such battle groups contain british destroyers such as the [Type 45](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_45_destroyer), whos air defence radars are so good the US asked us to turn them off as they kept losing recent exercises because of it. Their missiles are also [abm capable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aster_%28missile_family%29) already too. The type 45 has the stated capability to 
&gt;simultaneously track, engage and destroy more targets than five Type 42 destroyers operating together.



So no, carrier groups arent 'pointless', regardless of what that guy thinks.

As to the second, likewise, there are some compelling answers.  One is in terms of the Northern European and Anglo-American work ethic, rooted in Calvinism and the need to justify the acquisition of material wealth as proof of one's pleasing God.  Calvin's idea that we're born predestined to heaven or hell and that our material wealth is a signifier as to which.  So being wealthy showed you were one of the saved rather than one of the damned, and people were obviously minded to strive for the former status.  

Less theologically, capitalism demands consumption simply because it's so superlative at mass production and addicted to growth, without it, the whole house of cards implodes.  In other words, one of the contradictions within it, is that it becomes a victim of its own success unless it can constantly find new markets and reinvigorate mature and fading ones.  This has driven empire, gunboat diplomacy and the forcing open of markets, the refusal to compromise with other economic systems, war, globalisation, marketing, the explosion of credit, etc.  It's held out the lure of lives of leisure through the pursuit of technology, but it's never delivered, and today more people work more hours globally than ever before.  Indeed, in the early decades of the last century as production threatened to massively overwhelm consumption, the advertising industry was born to attach our real desires - family, friendship, love, sex, leisure, freedom - to their products in order to sell them to us in ever greater quantities.

If you think the financial crisis is behind us, I admire your optimism. London housing IS a bubble on a bubble, inflated by a global supply of ultra cheap money, and it will eventually correct, probably when interest rates creep back up. Look at what happened in Turkey last week.

The National Audit Office has been all over PFIs making recommendations and none of them are throwing them all away. https://www.nao.org.uk/report/the-performance-and-management-of-hospital-pfi-contracts/

Personally I like the principle of putting the money back into local hands with a series of small projects.  They do need to be better managed and economies of scale brought back to the Government.

'Cherry picked' is a bit rich, considering it was the paragraph after the paragraph you directly linked to.  And the only reason I didn't mention the paragraph you directly linked to was because it was so embarrassing to your perspective that I thought I'd just not mention it.

&gt;The SDI plan was initially for a space-based railgun system. However, due to technological constraints, the system was transformed into a surface-based system known as the Lightweight Exo-atmospheric Projectile (LEAP).

A space based rail gun suffered from 'technological constraints' - so this incredible new space-based missile sniping device actually became a surface to air weapon... which didn't work.  

You then talk about radar this and radar that.  You show me a radar that can stop a ballistic missile, and I'll start taking you seriously.  Even if one of these ballistic defence weapons had a 90% success rate, how much would it cost to actually sink this £3billion boat?  Would it £3billion worth of missiles?  I'm thinking 'no'.

And whilst I'm on the subject.

&gt;He's also conveniently ignoring a few facts such as that carriers don't go sailing around the ocean on their own looking for fun.

He doesn't *ignore* this fact... it is simply irrelevant.  If you don't have a weapon that can take down a ballistic missile, what use is it to have more boats in the ocean?  Do you plan to shield the big boat with smaller boats?

sure but it's a packet of mini cheddars every now and again not the KFC diet

or that the other parents didnt want their kids to be kicked out of school for daring to question the mini hitler in charge of it

&gt;I would say that disobeying school rules repeatedly and then going to the press was pretty unreasonable.

the rule was IMO unreasonable and going to the press was only as a result of the excessive action taken by the school over such a minor issue

&gt;However, if they find the rule unreasonable, there are other options that they can take. As we have established

again home schooling doesnt produce very good results generally and the availability of other options depend greatly on the areas of the schools in question

true,blainusjones,null,null,"&gt;So with the recent state of play regarding him, i thought we could have a bit of a discussion about whether he has a future at the club. For anyone not aware, he has been rewarded for winning [December's player of the month award](http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~3605732,00.html) with a nice cosy seat on the bench and some people take issue with this. So I'll get us started with a few questions:

&gt;- How do you rate Albrighton as a player? Is he good enough?
- Why do you think Lambert is leaving him out? And is he right to?
- Do you think he has a future at the club?
- Even if he is offered a contract extension, is it in his best interests to move elsewhere?

I think he is the best wideplayer we've had since Young. In his breakthrough season he sometimes kicked the likes of Young, Downing and Gabby out of the team in favour of playing him on either wing. He definitely has the ability to do well for us. So for that reason I believe he should be given a future contract, maybe lambert doesnt believe he warrants his wages but thats another story. I wouldnt like to see him at another club because, as ive said, he is good enough. 

He has every right to move if the option of another contract or an extention on his current one doesnt emerge. He bleeds claret and blue though, that showed during a few games before christmas when he was our best player, as you said, winning player of the month for December. I think we would regret letting go a natural wide player who is home-grown.

For all of his good points though (commitment, passion, supporting the club), I just dont believe lambert thinks he fits in the side when we're at full strength. There is so much potential for us to play well from the wings while getting results to show for it too. We've shown in the last 3/4 games that from wide positions we are a massive threat. Even the best teams cant defend against a player who can put the ball where he wants in the box. I believe Marc Albrighton is that type of player.

Excellent work on proving Godwins law here. How is the person running the school a mini-Hitler? Because they are enforcing school rules that are proven to benefit pupils? Really?

Why do you think the rule is unreasonable when it can be proven to provide better educational results for children? Besides, there are loads of other, more suitable places to discuss their grievance, like the governors, or OFSTED. 

On your final point, we are back to my first. If you want to send your child to school, you obey its rules. Or you find another school. Or you educate the child yourself.

You also completely ignored the information about both the Astor missiles and CIWS, and you also fail to mention the Type 45 (an incredible bit of kit). 

The CIWS is standard equipment on all RN and USN ships. So with all the ships in a carrier group having this system, they are going to have plenty of point defense against incoming missiles. Seriously, a dozen ships, each firing 6,000 rounds per minute from weapons that can independently track and target incoming missiles, and you and the author of that shitty article claim there is no missile defense. It boggles the mind

Then there is top cover from carrier based aircraft to intercept enemy fighters before they get into missile range.

And the RADAR itself doesn't stop the missile, the targeting information it provides to a ships countermeasures, such as the CIWS and anti missile missiles, does.

Really? I seriously can't see that at all, I heard it's like that in Australia.

Being that white Britains are the majority of the country, at 80something% it's just a bit odd seeing our capital city like that. Especially in an area that has historically been white-working class cockneys, and I guess in media around that world, it's still depicted that way.

I love reading the Doctor Who books, if you like reading (&amp; Doctor Who) you will as well. I recall being shocked by how much I did enjoy them:) most of the books are right at 240-250 pages in length, unless it's a quick read, then, 110-120, sometimes less. 

I have Doctor Who ebooks &amp; physical copies, some of the latter in paperback, some in hardback. While I've never come across any Doctor Who books that were total ""snoozers"", I have had some I enjoyed more than others. Below is a list of the titles I really liked, categorized by Doctor. 

9th Doctor-
The Deviant Strain
The Stealer of Dreams
Only Human (&lt;--LOVED this book w/ Rose, Capt Jack &amp; the 9th Doc) 

10th Doctor-
Autonomy
Beautiful Chaos
Forever Autumn
Feast of the Drowned
Martha in the Mirror
Prisoner of the Daleks

11th Doctor-
Magic of the Angels (Quick Reads)
Plague of the Cybermen
Paradox Lost 
Touched by an Angel
The Dalek Generation
Apollo 23
The Silent Stars Go By
Dark Horizon
Shroud of Sorrow (&lt;--this one starts out really good, but I'll admit, the ending is kind of stupid) 

Anyway, these are my favorites among them so far, I started off my Doctor Who reading excursion with the 11th Doctor. So far, I have to say that his books are by far the most humorous, because he was so giddy &amp; childlike I'm sure. Either way, I always felt that the authors writing 11 really were able to nail down his personality completely. 

Anyway, these were my favorites, might give you a starting point....I'm not sure which e-reader you use, I've used them all &amp; still use 2, the Nook &amp; the Kindle. I had to transfer several ebooks from 1 device to another on more than 1 occasion which prompted me to create PDF files for more than a few, esp., for my Kindle...my point is, if you'd like, I could send you some of the ebooks (in PDF form) if you'd like.

no it's because they are enforcing a draconian rule in an unreasonably harsh manner, kind of like Hitler might do but on a smaller scale

because it's not the place of the school to decide between optimum diet and a treat once in a while, their place is to teach and nothing more

It's a shame knowing that we'd be in this spot or that spot if we hadn't made mistakes, but no one has a flawless season. Everyone has problems this year. We have to remember that we're still young in Rodgers' project. It's easy to forget that when we're showing flashes of brilliance, but if we make top four this year that will be a year ahead of schedule.

We must continue to be patient. There will be more defensive errors to come. Instead of grabbing our pitchforks, let's celebrate the progress we've made and the fact that Rodgers *will* lead us to a successful future.

&gt; Working in our small team you will be calling potential businesses on the phone throughout the south of England selling exhibition space for our show taking place in Bournemouth in March

Hmm, seems like it's a short term job until the exhibition in March then? 

&gt;Job Term:  Permanent

Okay, so it is permanent then?

&gt;this is initially a 3 month trial contract but if you prove yourself to be the sales person we have been looking for then we will happily extend a permanent contract subject to satisfactory completion of the trial period.

Ah, so more likely than not, the poor jobseeker **will** be dumped as soon as the exhibition is over and then have to wait months to reapply for jobseekers and housing &amp; council tax benefit.

Sorry Mr Harris, as long as the jobcentres keep making short term employment such a pain in the arse, you're going to have problems and the job looks like a ""pick-up-and-dump"" for appallingly low wages.

Each and every time he's been played on the left, he's been dangerous. He beats his man with ease, works well with Rose, and just generally makes a nuisance of himself. On the right?  He's a slightly taller Jermain Defoe. He's supposedly two footed, but has shown a tendency to take the ball on his left, no matter where. It would be one thing if he'd shown even an ounce of self control, but he hasn't. And it isn't even game to game. There have been two or three matches where he's split his time. Every time it happens, he's great on the left, and poor on the right. Every single time. And even if we assume that he can curb his tendencies on the right, we shouldn't be playing him there.

One could argue that other companions just had to ""go with it"" when the Doctor regenerated, no phone calls, texts, skype, video-conferencing from ""THEIR Doctor"", i.e., his old face...so there's no precedent. And as one comment points out, Clara IS touted as ""The Impossible Girl"" having met/interacted with/saved every version of the Doctor except the War Doctor, so 1 would think she might be used to it...

However, Clara &amp; 11, they weren't romantically linked/flirty/touchy-feely with 1 another, unless you look to the special The Snowmen, where Clara is a barmaid/governess. In that episode there was quite a bit more flirting being batted back &amp; forth, but in a very sweet &amp; innocent way. I always liked the way that episode was written just b/c of how that budding attraction was written between the 2. Not gratuitous, just normal &amp; very ""Awwwwwww"" inspiring. I got the feeling from that episode, if Clara had lived, yep, we'd have had another pairing like 10 &amp; Rose, except better. Even though it was only hinted at, the few moments we were able to glimpse it from the sidelines those brief moments between Clara &amp; 11 were sweeter than the entirety of 10 &amp; Rose. 

Even though Clara died in that episode, I always felt like her reincarnated version retained at least some of those memories, echoes of it. Something about Clara's relationship with 11, I can't really explain it, just that underlying current between the 2, it makes me understand exactly why Clara would need that last moment of 11 reassuring her after his regeneration. Sure, she saved all the Doctors, but she didn't ""know"" any of them like 11. What it all boils down to is that while all the Doctors benefited from Clara's existence, they didn't really know her at all. 11 was the only 1 to be there while Clara discovered that she was born to save the Doctor, when she remembered all she had been through to save the Doctor &amp; 11 was the one to comeback in The Name of the Doctor &amp; save her when she was trapped in his timeline while saving him.

The most obvious example is Sigurdsoon, who back when he was scoring goals i still contended that he was a shit winger who's anonymous performances were papered over by some well-taken goals. I have being proved correct.

Now quit this little obssesion you would appear to have with me, relax and take a look at some of my prediciotns, things that I have said - as I am sure that you will find a strong record of being correct.

And also you appear to be dodging one of my questions: Do you think that Paulinho is a great passer of the ball with terrific vision?

He's not really funny (French humour, what'd you expect?) but he doesn't seem hateful either. If you have a video which displays his hateful side, please do link me to it.

&gt;Nobody cares that your grandparents died, Jews. Get over it!

I think it's more of the fact that the Holocaust is basically an industry nowadays. I believe that this treatment of the Holocaust does more to tarnish the impact of the historical event than the criticism of the industry does.

I guess it all fits into the dilemma over whether the Tories are doing what they're doing because they feel they *have* to, given the circumstances; or because they *want* to, given cutting public spending and services has been the default Tory platform for decades.

That means that if you take a 150 to 300 metre radius, they can hit within this. When the target isn't moving, and you know *exactly* where it is. That's absolutely acceptable for nukes. A Nimitz has a waterline beam of 40 m, it can move at over 20 metres per second, and launching a ballistic missile at it requires knowing exactly where it is when launched, and then being able to track that carrier exactly for the entire flight time and make course adjustments accordingly which are completely accurate.

Put simply, me, and many others, are not convinced that this thing is the death-wand that people make it out to be. The most accurate MRBM has a circular error probability of 40 m, and that's not a Chinese missile. There is still a lot of development to do before these things pose the sort of threat that people make them out to.

How many missiles can you fire at one carrier before it becomes not worth it anymore?

Yes we are. For their time on workfare their wages are essentially their JSA which comes from the public purse.

&gt;I spent most of a decade as an agency worker driving lorries. You are not anywhere near up to the speed of the full time workers.

Once again, relevance? There are a gazillion and one different types of agencies and we are clearly not talking about the same ones.

&gt;So the claims of the number of people who got jobs is wrong?

As somebody who has researched this issue a great deal over the last 5 years and secretary of my local trade union I feel I can categorically say that the very rare exceptions you are referring to do not reflect the experience of the majority who have been through the workfare and similar schemes.

&gt;Could it be that people weren't hired because they took the Reddit view so did the minimal required to keep the DWP happy?

The DWP is basically never happy. As for reddit, reddit's made up of people, these people give their opinions...blah, blah, blah.

I do suggest doing as little as possible but for each person to use their own judgement. To my knowledge, one is highly unlikely to be offered a paid position as a result of workfare, especially if it's at a particularly large company.

i'm sure they may want to do the interpretive dance, but realistically students need to understand that universities or jobs will consider the tougher subjects are ""better"" choices in the long run. are we simply setting up students for a life at starbucks or mcdonalds by allowing them to choose such soft subjects? when other students who opted for the tough life choices will always have the step above the rest for their choice in subjects when applying for jobs.

most businesses would bin CVs with light a-levels like so. 

yes im not saying people shouldnt take these subjects, by all means interpretive dance may be important to their life career. but given the choice 9/10 students would take the soft option to get into University easier. I know i would if i could. i think a lot of people need to realise job prospects are related to your schooling choices.

It was reasonable for him to assume the greatest and most supported military in the world could have handled it. Instead, they disbanded the army and prepared for waves of refugees in the west which never came.

That said, Britain also fucked up. When given the choice between focusing on having soldiers or state-building military police in the 1998 strategic defence review, they decided to have soldiers while redefining 'state-building' to allow them to pretend that they were capable of doing so.

true,[deleted],null,null,"OK.  Well, the term cruise missile has not been mentioned yet, but we'll assume that all mentions of 'ballistic missiles' up to this point are in fact interchangeable with 'cruise missiles'.  I'm not sure about this (I actually think this is wrong), and quite honestly I'm getting a little bored with the increasing levels of bean-counting in order to make the point that I have no point - but I'll entertain it for the moment.  

So £2million per cruise missile (an overestimate) still means you have 1500 top grade missiles per carrier.  Let's discount the platform and setup costs of the missiles as we can pretend that that cost is countered by actually equipping the carrier... which is essentially just a platform itself.  Aircraft, staff, ammo, payroll, etc etc.  

Now considering that we still have not actually had a mention of a technology that can convincingly knock a cruise missile out the sky to any convincing degree of success - I'm sticking with my point of view.

Not to mention that if this situation were to ever occur - it's a lot easier to produce cruise missiles and get them to the front than it will be to built carriers and ship them off with a cargo full of rations, ammo, aircraft, staff, and the necessary fleet of protective vessels.

I'm hearing lots of 'yeah but this, yeah but that, yeah but you don't know this, yeah but you don't know that - but no one is pointing at something and saying - no, you;re wrong because *this* this flicks cruise missiles out the sky like a swatter deletes flies.  It's a basic situation of attrition.  If you float a carrier, you are constantly protecting it from relatively inexpensive and mobile attack platforms.

In addition, this page is interesting:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_defense

Especially this paragraph:
&gt;There are still technological hurdles to an effective defense against ballistic missile attack. The United States National Ballistic Missile Defense System has come under scrutiny about its technological feasibility. Intercepting midcourse (rather than launch or reentry stage) ballistic missiles traveling at several miles per second with a ""kinetic kill vehicle"" has been characterized as trying to hit a bullet with a bullet. Despite this difficulty, there have been several successful test intercepts and the system was made operational in 2006, while tests and system upgrades continue.[5] Moreover, the warheads or payloads of ballistic missiles can be concealed by a number of different types of decoys. Sensors that track and target warheads aboard the kinetic kill vehicle may have trouble distinguishing the ""real"" warhead from the decoys, but several tests that have included decoys were successful. Nira Schwartz's and Theodore Postol's criticisms about the technical feasibility of these sensors have led to a continuing investigation of research misconduct and fraud at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[6]

The main issue in my eyes is the holocaust denial laws as well as the ""inciting racial hatred"" laws that the EU has been expanding since the mid 90's.  
My personal interpretation of the holocaust denial laws is that they were used to shut down the generation of Hitler Youth that remained poisoned following the fall of the Third Reich.  
Since this is now 2014 these laws are unnecessary yet have been expanded upon instead.

If anything I see Dieudonnes existence a relatively positive one because it forces Europe to deal with these strange laws they have implemented. While it is unknown whether Dieudonne skirts the line because he is interested in these laws or anti-semitic isn't really very relevant, what's important is that we abandon these laws in my eyes.  
If anything they feed the absurd narrative that ""jews control the world"" as opposed to actually helping.

I've personally examined some of his work and the quotes that people like to band about (some of which lack good context and are more ""justified"" than they look at first). If I am to approach these in a completely objective fashion I actually find it hard to call either way.

However if I consider the company he keeps (holocaust deniers and the French National Front) I would suggest that it is likely that he is anti-semetic.

However I think this isn't actually important to the debate. What's important is that he's not very funny, nor interesting and if he was just ignored he'd be nowhere as big as he has become since the French government started getting on his case.  
What the French government should be paying more attention to is the second and third generation immigrants that are still discriminated against in France and are incredibly disadvantaged.

They are completely mismatched with the aircraft that they are designed to carry.

If you are going to build a huge 70,000 tonne carrier, you build it with either [steam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_catapult) or [electromagnetic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_Aircraft_Launch_System) catapults.

This allows the ship to carry a range of fixed-wing aircraft. Attack aircraft such as the [F-35B](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-35#F-35B), [F-35C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-35#F-35C), [F/A-18E](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_F/A-18E/F_Super_Hornet) or [F/A-18C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F/A-18_Hornet) Hornets, [EA-6B Prowlers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA-6_Prowler) for electronic warfare, [E-2 Hawkeyes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-2_Hawkeye) for airborne early warning and [C-2 Greyhounds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-2_Greyhound) for transporting equipment.

The QE class ships lack catapults, so the **only** fixed wing aircraft *of any type* that they will be able to carry is the F-35B, a STOVL aircraft. **Nothing else** will be able to land on them.

The best power source for a large carrier is a nuclear reactor, but the QE class have 4 big diesel engines which means reduced range and less motive power (and is the reason that the ships can't generate the energy needed for an EMALS system).

If we were going to build a carrier that could only carry F-35B STOVL aircraft, then we should have built 4 or 6 35,000 tonne Invincible-sized ships. This would give the Royal Navy far greater flexibility - one huge ship is a huge target that needs more support ships to follow it around. 

Building some ships like the [US Wasp class](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasp-class_amphibious_assault_ship) carriers would have been a far more suitable choice for our needs.

true,ukunemployed111,null,null,"im unemployed an worked in a couple of charity shops.

basically a charity shop is a sorting machine where the volunteers sort out the rubbish from the good stuff. this is hard work believe me, you think the good stuff finds itself? or the shop is magically well organised? nope that's all the staff. that vintage dress you paid £8 for here instead of £30 in a ""pre-loved"" shop was the result of alot of sorting through ripped tshirts and 80's muppets toys in big plastic bags. 

but here's the 411

1. there are only 3 people who are in a charity shop the real volunteers,community service servers and the unemployed.

2. everything gets either recycled or goes into the shop very occasionally we throw stuff away, don't go through the bins it really has not to be useful to us to end up there. we make almost as much money from pulp and rags as we do selling stuff in the shop.there is alot of heavy lifting involved, be prepared to get knackered. if the pulp or collections van comes be prepared to work into your lunch a little.

3.turn up in your regular clothes.your sorting donations and organising/cleaning the shop 90 percent of the time. when was the last time you saw someone in a charity shop who wasn't on the till wear a suit.

4. Its not clean. Change your clothes when you get home,wash you hands before lunch. You will be dealing with unwashed underwear,bras,dusty old clocks coated with dust. the worst thing we had was a pear of trousers with a massive skid mark in them. also another reason not to wear a suit.

5. The shop floor is 90 percent cleaning and organising 10 percent till work and directing customers. till work is basically the top job except the boss if you've just come in don't expect to get it, the next job down is accompanying the delivery driver. Be careful as they will want you to put your back out lifting stuff to cars in the chance that a customer buys a bit of furniture, its best to palm this off to the mr macho types that tend to volunteer anyway.

6. avoid the clicky volunteers, they tend to take a dislike to outsiders. same thing for the community service people who really dont want to be there and seem dodgy.

7. job centre will be more lenient on your actions as your on the scheme. but you still have to apply for jobs usually.

8. its nice if you find the right shop and settle in and they start to like you. try. if it really is too much just walk out dont get angry.

9. there's more than one charity shop/shop in most towns that you can go to.

10. at least its getting out the house and meeting people even if its annoying, you gain more respect for the hard work charity volunteers do.",0,1391453458,null,0,false,0,cf62y9o,t3_1wtrgn,t1_cf62y9o,t3_1wtrgn,null,1432235481,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

We are revolutionary, as we understand that capitalism cannot be reformed away, since every reform is ultimately repealed by the ruling capitalist class, who are fully prepared to make small concessions if it means maintaining and protecting their wealth and power. That said, we operate under the principles of [The Transitional Programme](http://www.socialistparty.org.uk/Trotsky/programme/), which means we intervene positively in smaller struggles, making sure to campaign against bigotry, fight cuts to jobs and services, work within trade unions, etc.

I'm sorry but this post of yours makes no sense to me.

1) How do you carry a thousand missiles? Most ship platforms can barely do 16. Do you intend putting up 600 ships? Then you need to have the people and the money and the fuel to run that many. That'll run WELL beyond the cost of a carrier. 

2) How will you target all of them? You don't have the bandwidth to aim, launch and provide mid-course updates to the missiles - oh yes, you need that too! - to get them to their target. Modern radar airborne platforms can only track a few hundred targets passively, and can actively communicate with far fewer.

3) What does your link have to do with firing BMs at ships? It doesn't counter anything I wrote in my previous post about the impossibilities in hitting carriers with BMs.

&gt;""It's obviously politically quite a contentious topic. I'm not sure we'll make progress on it in the coming months in terms of legislation - there may be some things short of legislation which we can do.""

&gt;He said politicians, police chiefs, the intelligence services all had to explain why changes were needed.

&gt;""In the most serious crimes [such as] child abduction communications data... is absolutely vital. I love watching, as I probably should stop telling people, crime dramas on the television. There's hardly a crime drama where a crime is solved without using the data of a mobile communications device.""

&gt;""What we have to explain to people is that... if we don't modernise the practice and the law, over time we will have the communications data to solve these horrible crimes on a shrinking proportion of the total use of devices and that is a real problem for keeping people safe.

&gt;""We have got to make this explanation very clearly, really get it out to people and then build, perhaps at the start of the next Parliament, a cross party case for sensible legislation to deal with this issue.

&gt;“In most of the serious crimes [such as] child abduction, communications data, [including] who called who and when, and where was the telephone at the time – not the content, but the communications data – is absolutely vital,” he said.
&gt;“I love watching crime dramas on the television. There’s hardly a crime drama where a crime is solved without using the data of a mobile communications device. That’s not about the content.”

You also claim that down votes discredit what I say. However I got heavily down voted for my opinion on sigurdsson and also my contention that the articles that said that Sherwood wanted to let Holtby go weren't bullshit - I was proved completely right. You can call me delusional all you want, but In fact I am the one who had being proven right time and time again.

You have failed to engage in discussion and instead resorted to ad hominem attacks. You have completely failed to provide examples of where I have being wrong, you have also ignored my point on Paulinho as you know you are wrong and then have decided to believe that you have educated me on his qualities when the reality is that If I was to believe what you say about Paulinho, I would be less informed
Of Paulinhos characteristics as you have inferred that he is a great passer with vision - which he is not. The reality is that I have probably seen far more of the player than you have as not only did I see all of his matches in the confed cup, but upon us signing I also went back and watched replays of the club World Cup, watched many braZilian friendlies while he has been in the team such as those vs England and watched almost every youtube video there is of him. Trust me, I am far more knowledgeable of the player than you are.

The fact that you resorted to pointing out that I was downvoted was quite pathetic, and jthe fact that you resorted to such attacks is quite saddening as it was clear to me that you were a somewhat intelligent person who was worth debating - the fact that you decided to end any sort of rational discussion was a shame.

In many respects with a solid Typhoon force there is definitely a good argument to the UK possessing relatively fewer air-superiority orientated aircraft like the F35 and more functional aircraft like the Chinook, Apache, Typhoon, A400M etc. i.e. aircraft that allow for force to be delivered on scale - rather than to facilitate any force being delivered.

The F35B still seems like a good bet. Ultimately (not that any of us wanted it this way) the carriers won't be ready for some years to come which gives us time to wait. It's also worth pointing out that just because a ship like an aircraft carrier can float and function as a ship doesn't mean it is immediately ready to receive aircraft. The RN will need several years of complex sea trials, familiarity training and scaling up to start full carrier operations - especially with radically more advanced technology and greater automation, as well as with a new generation of aircraft... considering the F35B is actually 3 full generations above the previous carrier air component (the Harrier II).

Finally, this isn't actually such a bad time to be waiting for expensive aircraft before placing large orders. The jury is still very much out over how future airforces will balance manned air supremacy with unmanned drones. This is even more cloudy when it comes to naval air wings where whole components of the force like ASW and AEW could potentially be hived off to drone aircraft in addition to the usual surveillance and combat roles.",0,1391456532,null,0,false,0,cf64g65,t3_1wuao9,t1_cf64g65,t1_cf5zrzx,null,1432236178,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Because the Time War didn't happen until long after Hartnell's era.

The Time War takes place between the 1996 TV movie (Eighth Doctor) and 2005's Series 1 (Ninth Doctor). It was previously assumed that the Eighth Doctor fought in the war and regenerated into Nine at the end of it (not long before 2005's *Rose*), but Moffat decided to insert a ""forgotten"" Doctor that fought in the war instead of Eight.

Check out [*The Night of the Doctor*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-U3jrS-uhuo), the short released a week or so before the 50th anniversary that depicts the Eighth Doctor's regeneration into the War Doctor.

true,Kai-Tek,lfc99,,"Gerrard is the real problem in this current formation, he just doesn't fit in. If we're going to play a front 3 of Studge/Suarez/Sterling with Coutinho behind them then we need to have 2 mobile energetic ball winners in the middle of the park, like City for example. 

It's no coincidence that with a midfield of Gerrard/Henderson we struggle to get any possession in the last few games, but what's even worse is that we can't seem to win the ball either. So they get overrun, can't keep the ball and dictate play, and cant win the ball either. This formation is rotten if you ask me, with Gerrard in it anyway. We dropped 4 points already because of it and I'm blaming Brendan for the WBA game as well. There was no balance in the team just like in the Villa game, we were set up too attacking. It did work somewhat in the Everton game and that's only because every player gave a 110% and Coutinho had a fantastic game in the defensive department, otherwise our midfield would've bee overrun once again.

I'm absolutely positive that we could've easily dominated the WBA game if we had a midfield of Gerrard/Hendo/Allen, but Brendan doesn't want to drop anyone of the attacking quartet (Suarez, Sterling, Sturridge, Coutinho) and is being really greedy which is costing us points.

*""But I've said this many times so as to make myself clear: these things seem unreal to me, like a dream, and I am unsure if they are real things that happened or are just dreams my head has made to try to answer the questions in my head and the questions I am being asked.""*

*""In these flashbacks that I'm having, I see Patrik as the murderer, but the way the truth feels in my mind, there is no way for me to have known because I don't remember FOR SURE if I was at my house that night.""*

*""The police have told me that they have hard evidence that places me at the house, my house, at the time of Meredith's murder. I don't know what proof they are talking about, but if this is true, it means I am very confused and my dreams must be real.""
*""What I don't understand is why Raffaele, who has always been so caring and gentle with me, would lie about this. What does he have to hide?""*

*""After dinner I noticed there was blood on Raffaele's hand, but I was under the impression that it was blood from the fish.""*

*""One of the things I AM SURE that definitely happened the night on which Meredith was murdered was that Raffaele and I ate fairly late, I think around 11 in the evening, ALTHOUGH I CAN'T BE SURE because I didn't look at the clock.""*

**It's so obvious that she's trying to distance herself and implicate either Sollecito and or Patrik at the same time.**

**She even ends her statement with which she thinks are the most important questions for the police:**

*""1. Why did Raffaele lie? (or for you) Did Raffaele lie?
2. Why did I think of Patrik?
3. Is the evidence proving my pressance [sic] at the time and place of the crime reliable? If so, what does this say about my memory? Is it reliable?
4. Is there any other evidence condemning Patrik or any other person?
5. Who is the REAL murder [sic]? This is particularly important because I don't feel I can be used as condemning testimone [sic] in this instance.""*

**Question 3 in itself is an absolute joke, as she's essentially wanting the police to confirm or deny that they have evidence that she was at the house during the murder so that she can choose the correct lie that coincides with this.**

**It's also quite a coincidence that her confusion only stems from the hours around which the murder took place, yet she can accurately remember what happened before the murders,** 

*""On Thursday November 1 I saw Meredith the last time at my house when she left around 3 or 4 in the afternoon. Raffaele was with me at the time. We, Raffaele and I, stayed at my house for a little while longer and around 5 in the evening we left to watch the movie Amelie at his house. After the movie I received a message from Patrik [sic], for whom I work at the pub ""Le Chic"". He told me in this message that it wasn't necessary for me to come into work for the evening because there was no one at my work.""* 

**Good solid start. No: I thinks, maybes, I dreamed this, I'm not sure or other such phrases. Let's evaluate the very next paragraph,**

""Now I remember to have also replied with the message: ""See you later. Have a good evening!"" and this for me does not mean that I wanted to meet him immediately. In particular because I said: ""Good evening!"" What happened after I know does not match up with what Raffaele was saying, but this is what I remember. I told Raffaele that I didn't have to work and that I could remain at home for the evening. After that I believe we relaxed in his room together, perhaps I checked my email. Perhaps I read or studied or perhaps I made love to Raffaele. In fact, I think I did make love with him.""

&gt;It’s no secret that I am no great fan of Sherwood’s. He played for Spurs in one of the most mediocre periods in the club’s recent history and I hold grudges. I don’t like the cannily employed persona of the homespun dispenser of common sense or the thinly veiled negation of the more cerebral and nuanced footballing template espoused by his predecessor. He plays to the gallery populated by those who wrinkle their noses at  the more methodical playing styles from the Continent, unless they’re writing about Jose Mourinho, of course. Sherwood is ostensibly a less crumpled replica of Harry Redknapp, with less chutzpah but with a similar propensity for outmoded football. He orders egg and chips when he’s  tanning himself in the Med. He wears tracksuits. He is the sum of all the PE teachers who made your life a misery at school. He looks like an owl.

Why should we take him seriously if he freely admits poorly-considered biases against Sherwood and doesn't make the slightest attempt to move beyond them?

&gt; the cannily employed persona of the homespun dispenser of common sense

This was never a Spurs hierarchy ploy or a Sherwood ploy. It comes from observers projecting what they want to hear derived from assumptions based on his appearance and nationality. 

&gt; the thinly veiled negation of the more cerebral and nuanced footballing template espoused by his predecessor.

What does that mean? I have no idea. I'm not sure AVB's tactics had any nuance. It was just pass for ages and hope something happens.

&gt; He plays to the gallery populated by those who wrinkle their noses at the more methodical playing styles from the Continent

Elitism, pure and simple. How could you not wrinkle your nose at the dire ""continental"" performances under AVB? You set out a team that matches the abilities of your players, and you don't force players into a system that doesn't suit them. 

&gt; However, the manner with which he was dispensed and the subsequent fawning in various media circles towards Sherwood and the apparent renaissance of the high maintenance Emmanuel Adebayor suggests that the club is riven with hidden agendas and politicking of the worst kind.

The ""manner in which he was dispensed"" - you mean how he was fired because we were playing shit? The ""Renaissance of Adebayor"" (coming to a cinema near you) is most likely down to a hidden agenda *of AVB*. And so he was fired, and we have our best player back, playing well. It doesn't ""suggest"" anything other than that. 

&gt; Imagine the braying if AVB had clung onto his job in December but had endured a further mauling by Manchester City last week.

Why is this sentence here? 

&gt; Football Focus’ preview of the Swansea match suggested that it was “all smiles at The Lane”. I don’t quite know where they got that impression

How about all the supporters happy that we've won a lot of matches recently and been scoring a lot of goals? Relatively happy Spurs fan, checking in. 

&gt; Factor in the abject cup exits to Arsenal and West Ham and you probably get a more accurate assessment of Sherwood’s first few weeks in charge.

Let's just forget that we were beaten 3-0 by West Ham, shall we? And, oh, 6-0 to City with 11 men on the pitch and 5-0 to Liverpool. 

&gt; Throughout this season, it’s felt like strangers in the crowd have been watching a team of strangers attempting to win football matches on the pitch.

He's making shit up to fit an agenda. 

&gt;  the continued stagnation of the club’s record signing on the bench

What the fuck? Lamela is injured. As for

&gt; the sale of Defoe, the loaning of Holtby

these do not seem to suggest a ""club that doesn't know what it's doing any more"". It's just business. Defoe and Holtby are hardly lynchpins of the team. 

&gt; We’re still a club that lurches from one crisis to another aided by a paucity of footballing nous from its shareholder businessmen.

What crises?! AVB failed so was sacked. A few of our signings (Lamela, really, the others are all doing decently, and I'm looking forward to how Sherwood will incorporate him) haven't found their place yet, but that's hardly indicative of a crisis. 

&gt; I read somewhere recently that a ‘fan’ blows hot and cold. He is changeable, intangible, temporary. ‘Supporters’ on the other hand, provide the foundations for the continued existence of their clubs. They prop it up, no matter what.

This guy sounds really like a ""fan"". Sack Levy and sell up hardly sounds like propping up the club, no matter what.

&gt; Or how about we start turning this club into something we can all be proud of? 

Like a club that is competitive in the league and in European competition without a sugar-daddy, a club that balances the books year-on-year with a financially responsible but not risk-averse approach, a club that plays attractive football and brings through youth when it can? That sort of club? Yeah, that's the sort of club I can get behind, even when things are uncertain.

There was someone on the news earlier who had their funding cut, despite having a wheelchair and lots of other stuff in their spare bedroom.

The couple said that it was difficult to find the £46 a month to cover the spare bedroom yet no mention had been made of:

a) That there was a fund set up specifically for people that had a medical or other genuine need for a spare room
b) Whether or not the couple had applied for any of this help (and based on Reddit anecdata from this very sub, *everyone* who says that have applied *have* received help)
c) They had a cat

I don't have a cat, so I don't know what they cost. 

My mother-in-law has had cats all her life and my wife has grown up around them, and I'm told that around £30 a month will cover worming, insurance, cat litter and food.

That's almost £46 right there.

Can they not find a family member to look after the cat?

Did your read what I said? I expressly stated that political parties SHOULD be held up to scrutiny, however when a media source focuses almost entirely on criticising one political party, they begin to lose credibility.

Your ending statement;
 
&gt;""they make a lot of noise about being christian yet seem to know nothing about humility, forgiveness and tolerance"" 

is completely subjective. Therein lies the problem. You're entitled to your opinion, however ""offtherecord"" claim to be some kind of political commentary blog, when in reality they're just anti-DUP and ""other"".

&gt;**Tu quoque** /tuːˈkwoʊkwiː/, ([Latin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin) for ""you, too"" or ""you, also"") or the **appeal to hypocrisy**, is a logical [fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy) that attempts to discredit the opponent's position by asserting the opponent's failure to act consistently in accordance with that position; it attempts to show that a criticism or objection applies equally to the person making it. This dismisses someone's point of view based on criticism of the person's inconsistency and not the position presented whereas a person's inconsistency should not discredit the position. Thus, it is a form of the ad hominem argument. To clarify, although the person being attacked might indeed be acting inconsistently or hypocritically, this does not invalidate their argument.

true,ianrush88,null,null,"Not sure if its that. Allen is just back from injury and might not have been ready for the full 90. I actually think Rodgers looked at the villa game where the front 4 were too far up the pitch, Henderson trying to link up with them, gerrard all alone failing to shield the defence and Toure running around in circles panicking; and decided that our best option for now is to sit deeper.

He dropped coutinho deeper, basically  mimicking the 1-2 lucas - allen, henderson midfield that was so good in december but with gerrard - henderson, coutinho. And we sat off, not pressing as high up preferring to restrict spaces in front and behind our defence. We've played like this since the bournemouth game and only conceded 1 goal and very few clear chances from open play so its shored up our defence. On the other hand, it has resricted our attack, only everton played into our hands and overcommitted leaving space for us to counterattack into. Against west brom who sat deep themselves it meant we were reliant on the front 3 coming up with something special, rather than the fluid team attacks we saw previously.

For henderson whose strengths are in pressing hard and supporting and getting ahead of the forwards, the balance of the midfield (gerrard and coutinho being weaker defensively that Lucas and Allen so requiring more cover) and tactics doesn't really suit his play. But he'll do a job, not really bothered by what's best for him, just whats best for the team.

I expect against arsenal Allen will come in for Coutinho and we'll play a gerrard - henderson,allen midfield. Rodgers might still ask them to sit deep though, until sakho or agger come back from injury. The question is when Lucas comes back? For me our best mdfield is Lucas - henderson allen, with gerrard as an impact sub on 60. Not sure Rodgers sees it this way though.",0,1391460865,null,0,false,0,cf66lrx,t3_1wwyly,t1_cf66lrx,t1_cf64wxu,null,1432237194,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

true,kde01,king,,"&gt; Soldado is not working. Has not worked and will not work. It is not of fault of his own, or fault of coaching. Its the fault of his ability to play in a faster and more physical league. He is a bust.

La Liga is just as fast as the Prem. Not as physical, sure, but the pace is no different.

&gt; Bentaleb needs more development. The boy has skills, but he is not a starter. He is young, and will get his time. Now is not it.

I wholeheartedly disagree. Now is the time to start him. He's 19. We could have a world class mid on our hands if we keep him playing. A player will scale to his opposition. Look at Obika. He was promising for so long but never brought up a level. His development stalled, and now he'll never see the pitch for us. Keep Bentaleb playing, but keep him for games against clubs outside the top 8.

&gt; Hugo needs to be told to play keeper and not sweeper. his inability to do so puts the defense at risk, as he almost cost spurs the game if it was not for a slow chip that dawson (I cant believe I am saying this) caught up to and cleared.

His ability to play sweeper is why we bought him, and he has saved us with this a few times. It's only a matter of time before his game adapts to our new more traditional defensive positioning. He's still instinctively playing like he has a high line in front of him. He'll get better.

&gt; We HAVE to play with 2 holding mids. This was we have 4 in the back, 2 holders, which frees the wings to roam with the strikers, and it cuts the chance for the counter.

2 holding mids? Only if we play a club like City or Arsenal, I think. You can't just say 'we need 2 holding mids' and leave it at that. That is so very situational. If you play 2 holding mids in a counter game every time you won't be able to force other teams to submit. A 4-4-2 is great vs. lower table opposition. It keeps us scoring. In top-half opposition only 1 holding mid is needed. Keep the 2 holding mids for the quick teams that pack the middle and only them.

 &gt; Addy HAS to stay up top. The lack of holders in the middle has forced him to come back and play defensive and try to win the ball. he should be getting served the ball outside and inside the 18, and not tracking back to get the ball.

Some of his best play has been outside of the box so far. If he's great in many positions, why restrict him to just one? Besides, we have other players that can score goals and they will seriously benefit of Ade's play, like...

&gt;  Lennon needs to be told to grow some balls and shoot. keeps it on frame and let the strikers clean up. He gets in, creates space, and then looks for the pass when the shot is clearly his.

...Lennon, who does need to shoot. I'm in agreement with you here. He needs to be more direct and stop trying to hoof it and chase it. I don't think he's technical enough for the direct game, though, so the best use of him is to have him chase balls that Ade brings down into the box and shoot with a hope for goal. 

&gt;  And this point showed me how green Tim is. When you go down to 10 men against a decent opponent and you are down 2-0, you take out slow players from the mid and FW, and you replace them with faster players and park the bus and play counter. This way if you get one, you keep the other team honest as they know you are parking the bus, and you give yourself a chance to stay in the game. otherwise you do what Tim did against City, and you get embarrassed.

I agree. Soldado should have come off for Sandro as soon as the card came out.

&gt;  Downvote away. you know I am right. I have loyalty to the team, not the team members individually. does not matter who the person is. like I said, we talk about being a top team...you cant get beat by them in the manner that we have been beaten. That is truth!

We are a team that has been undergoing a lot of turmoil and unrest this season. It was never going to be an easy season. A loss is a loss. This season was never going to come down to GD after the first City match. We just need to focus on picking up as many points as possible. One win against Everton and we're back in it. Don't count us out just yet. 

You need to fail to learn how to succeed. I highly doubt you'd be able to perform as well as Tim. He was doing very, very well with our youth squads before taking over. He has infinitely more experience than you, and he's not just pulling everything he does out of his ass. He has his reasons.

Bit early to suggest such a thing, some players come to form later than others.

Isn't this one of the reasons AVB was let go? for such negativity? we don't have a modric-esque player who can produce a deep lying pass which unlocks a defence so I wouldn't agree

&gt; Hugo needs to be told to play keeper and not sweeper. his inability to do so puts the defense at risk, as he almost cost spurs the game if it was not for a slow chip that dawson (I cant believe I am saying this) caught up to and cleared.

This is a hot and cold matter. At times, Lloris' speed off his line is the sole reason we dont concede. [See this for instance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q1mthgYgBs). I don't agree that we should tell him to stick to his line as he is the keeper for a reason and I trust his judgement over mine tenfold.

You have your opinions and I have mine, but as far as some of your suggestions go, there are some within here that are flawed which is where my opinion comes in.

And it's not even about the mass commercialisation, I buy Christmas presents because it's fun to celebrate something all together and the food is delicious, and cards and presents for my mum and dad on Mothers' and Fathers' day because they deserve to be treated nicely, and I don't want them to feel like other people think they brought up a rude child when they have to say I didn't get them anything.

But Valentine's Day just cannot sit right with me.  If you're single, you're made to feel like you've failed by not finding somebody.  If you're in a newish relationship, you get all this pressure to express a sentiment you just might not feel yet, and even if you do, it's new enough that you talk about it often anyway.  If you're in a longer relationship, especially one with children, I can see it; life gets in the way, and you don't always have time for romance.

Maybe one day I'll be married with kids and I'll welcome the reminder to be romantic with my husband.  But I'm twenty-fucking-five, almost all of my income is effectively disposable, and I've been with my fella for all of five minutes, if I wanted to buy him a present to tell him I love him, I bloody would've done.  Valentine's Day isn't meant for people like me.

BUT! Usually you can end a tenancy earlier and the landlord should make reasonable efforts to find someone to take over from you for (in your situation) the part month. You're entitled to try find someone to take over, too.  

Talking with the landlord is probably the way forward - you might be pleasantly surprised.

Double-check with the CAB or Shelter?

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Bentaleb needs more development. The boy has skills, but he is not a starter. He is young, and will get his time. Now is not it.

If he is starting ahead of Sandro or Dembele then i will agree with you. For now however I can see why he is playing.

&gt; Hugo needs to be told to play keeper and not sweeper. his inability to do so puts the defense at risk

He saves us more than he hurts us though. As a whole he makes a massive net contribution by doing this.

&gt;  which frees the wings to roam with the strikers, and it cuts the chance for the counter. 

It depends who those wingers are though. Lennon and Sigurdsson dont really do anything these days and Chadli provides a decent outlet but is similarly limited. We need our midfielders to support our attack unless it would be really, really bad! If we had Townsend-Eriksen-Lamela playing though then I could see this possibly working.

&gt; Addy HAS to stay up top. The lack of holders in the middle has forced him to come back and play defensive and try to win the bal

I think that you are overestimating the extent to which this occurs and/or the extent to which this affects our attack. TBH I think that this is kind of a ridiculous point.

&gt; Lennon needs to be told to grow some balls and shoot

Lennons shooting is crap though - him shooting is largely a waste of possesion on the most part.

&gt; you replace them with faster players and park the bus and play counter

Absolutely ridiculous point. Here were our unused subs vs City:



    Roberto Soldado Jermain Defoe Nacer Chadli Brad Friedel



None of these guys are very fast! Defoe is slower than Ade so that wasnt really a goer. Chadli would have replaced Eriksen - a player who is just as quick as Chadli.

Be aware that this is a student city so hospitality jobs are pretty competitive, but I was never short of work behind a bar or coffee counter during 7 years of the industry. You just have to put in the leg work and be prepared to try and talk to people, not just drop off a CV and walk away. A decent coffee place will employ on personality as much as a CV, which in Brighton they'll get at least a few a week.

Do you have the resources to move to Brighton and make no money for a month? If you put the work in it won't take you more than that long to find a job. Are you aware of the cost of living in Brighton? It's a lot more expensive than most places, although not as costly as London. Rent is likely to be £400pcm in a shared house.

I think its far to early to give up on Soldado as a whole. He's got the quality, were not setting him up as best we can. That can be fixed. But for now, we need to go with the hot(ish) boot in Ade. 

Bentaleb should be in the rotation. Depending on opposition, he has a place in this team, and plays a different role. We should use him, but not exclusively. 

Hugo is fine. He prevents far more chances than he screws up his charges. Hell be fine. Let him do his thing. 

We have to play one defensive mid. Sandro or Capoue should be on the pitch in 9/10 matches for us. Them along with one of Mousa, Paulinho, and Bentaleb. Two is just silly defensive. 

Ade needs to find a better balance. He has great linkup play, but he still is our center forward. He needs to actually be forward more often than not.

I agree on Lennon. Lamela should get a shot when healthy if only because Lennon has done nothing to warrant keeping him in the side. 

I don't argue that Tim needed to make a change against City, but we were very, very limited. We likely should have brought on Chadli for Soldado and had him play the wing. But we didn't have the pace on the bench that your asking for.

They didn't push a guy behind them.

He walked up to them, they patted him on the shoulder and he walked behind them.  Then fiddled with his radio (shame youtube compresses footage so much because on the original footage you can see his radio dangling between his legs).

It's too late now but if you dispute this, I'm more than happy to slow that footage down with a large red arrow showing him walk towards the officers (four of them @5:48) and be let behind them, the first office patting him on the shoulder.

If you want to look at this as a long term career, that's the kind of thing you want to be focusing on for your first job, training and development.

true,GlassesAndMoustaches,logo,Merlin,"Demi made some important tackles in the first half, he wasn't shit and when he stayed back he stopped them on the counter. However when he went forward the middle was exposed and Chelsea went there. I would've preferred Milner but apparently he's not 100% and I'd prefer him fully fit for Barca and the FA cup match. Rodwell may have become too frustrated having Chelsea run him ragged so probably best he didn't start, although we could have done with him from 65 mins+. Pellerz should have brought him off but for who?

Unfortunately Silva missed a few opportunities and him and Navas couldn't work it into the crucial 8 yard part of the box. Cech would have collected anything too close to him which forced us to play it back but there were about 9 Chelsea players making up the box. On the corners however I think we could have done with swinging it in, as opposed to trying to put it on somebody's head. 

Ref was debatable but it was all swings and roundabouts so I'm not gonna go there. 

Nasty disappointed a little bit but after being out of the starting 11 for a while what were we to expect? 

Dzeko wasn't given enough chances and Negredo seemed too complacent, it looked as though he was waiting for the ideal cross, but that never came. 

Yaya was a bit scared to storm forward for fear of Chelsea getting us on the counter. He played well though, but he needed the reassurance of Fernandinho to help him. 

That save by Hart when it was 4 vs 1 gave me a fucking erection and the rest. Not only did he save it but he put enough pressure on the striker (I missed who) to have to bicycle kick it. Well done Hart, he had a good game. 

Well we're beaten at home and Mourinho has done the double on us, but he's still a boring arrogant cunt who will brag how good he is tomorrow. Let the footy do the talking and watch us win the league and not them. No football team is perfect but the best team will fight to the end and that's what our City will do.

It was the fact that Pellegrini didn't fill the midfield with an extra man. Pretty much every ball fell to them which allowed them to flock forwards. Even had Fernandinho been fit I would have wanted to see 3 men in the centre. Eg. Fernandinho, and Demichelis sitting behind/alongside Yaya. 
However overall had Silva put the ball away, and Dzeko not being so dire  Pellegrini could have felt vindicated. 
The first half was fine up until their goal. Then the defence fell apart and City were lucky not to concede more. Continued into the beginning of the second.
Jovetic coming on for Negredo offered way more attacking. Dropped back, asked for the ball, tried to take on players. Could have become a HERO had he scored that in the dying moments.
I preferred the ball with Kolarov as opposed to Navas, flinging it in from his side but Chelseas defense was never going to be easy to beat which made all the chances fluffed so frustrating!
Anyway, much will be said of the scoring streak and winning streak coming to an end, who care. Only streak you want to be best at is from season to season. Still in second. Ahead of Chelsea and two points behind Arsenal. Let's hope Arsenal drop some points against the big boys and City dust themselves off and move on.

true,no_soul_ginger,flair3,,"2 holding mids?  You sound like my U-19 coach did.  We drew more games that season than we won.

You can't win against a modern, pacey team, when you put 2 holding mids out there.  That leaves us attacking with only 4 players.  Sure, yes those holders can move up the pitch and play support, leave the defenders to a high line, but when you do that, the other team just has to bunker in and counterattack.  Either you lose to the long ball played in between defenders, or you play to a draw since they have all 11 in their half and you can't open up space. You play a pair of box-box or 1 holding 1 attacking.

Are you forgetting Adebayor's flanking runs and crosses?  He's been pretty damn accurate in delivery, and his hold up ability (when the midfield isn't sending him hospital balls) allows the wingers and 2nd striker to get forward.  He's been a big part of the build up play and execution in the final third.  Moving him into a poacher's role would seriously limit our holdup and attacks on the break.  Eriksen doesn't have the size or speed to shrug off multiple challenges at midfield, and Dembele doesn't have the touch.  Besides...you play 2 holders in the middle and who the hell is there to pass the ball to at 40 yards from goal?  You end up only being able to link attacking play down the wings, which, without Townsend or Lamela, we only have ONE of.  Or are you also suggesting we invert those wingers?

Lloris is a sweeper-keeper.  As a 25 year veteran coach, you should know that players have natural instincts and abilities that are their strengths - and you don't want them to ignore those strengths.  He's fast off his line and breaks up far more opportunities.  Yes, he's been off a bit since his concussion.  I'd take Lloris over any keeper in the EPL, still.

Speaking of taking players...I'll take Lennon passing to a goal-hungry striker in the final third over him shooting left-footed, too.

With a *single* holding mid, you have someone covering CBs and an attacking mid whose job is to move the ball forward and...attack.  You still get the supporting player and a high line, but now you get 5 attackers, and start to outnumber a defense.  CDM doesn't have to push as far up in support, leaves you less exposed to a fast counter, and they can drop in to defend and keep 3 in the 'back' when RB or LB (or both) get forward.  If you're really pressing, then they can make a late run to the top of the box and pick up a loose ball and long strike.

Soldado was first suffering from nowhere near enough service - I blame trigger happy Townsend for that, along with AVB who didn't give him a fucking strike partner.  Now he's go no goals, no confidence, all desperation....and that was tragically apparent against Hull.  Soldado from 2012-13 would have put that flick in, and would have first-timed that other chance instead of taking another touch.  He needs game time, and he needs service.  Those two will give him the goals.  But when he's not been scoring, he's been making excellent runs, collecting the ball at the edges for redistribution, and in general his off-ball movement has been one to show the u-15 kiddos.  Yes, he's gone down pretty easily (don't MOST strikers?), and he's not shy about giving an earful when a call's been missed.  Call that whining and diving, whatever.

Come off it.  You obviously didn't get the nod for Spurs top job...and you don't know the whole story (neither do we) about training and everything behind the scenes.

Nasri, Aguero, Milner, Fernandinho all out injured. Rodwell and Jovetic not at match fitness. Negredo injured during the game.

We still only lost 1-0. Take 4 of Chelsea's best players out of their team and we win by more than 1.

On to more critical terms:

Edit - Pellegrini had no choice because of injuries.

Also Dzecko - he's going to be 4th striker within 2 months. After Negredo went off he disappeared for large parts of the game. Jovetic looked positive, if he wasn't against such a great 8 man Chelsea defence he probably would have scored. Dzecko on the other hand looked like he could comprehend scoring or shooting on target.

Nastasic and Kompany weren't communicating well either, Nasty looked unsettled and nervous at times. Can't really blame him, he was exposed by Demichelis.

---
However, despite all that, we only lost 1-0, Vinny was epic in defence, he was heroically throwing himself around and making tackles everywhere.

On another day, Silva's freekick or Jovetic's shot go in and we draw or win.

And the injuries are pretty short term. So lets not be too depressed, Pellegrini will have learnt alot and don't forget what happened after our last beating - we went and won the next leg. FA cup 10 days away, time to make up for it.

true,derleth,null,null,"&gt; Just a little heads up, you seem to have some incorrect ideas as to what far leftists believe.

I was only speaking to what's in the Communist Manifesto. I'm aware most modern Socialist leftists left that behind long ago.

&gt; When leftists talk about private property they make a distinction between ""private property"" and ""personal property"", they only wish to abolish private ownership of the means of production, things such as your house, car and personal belongs, they have no interest in taking away from you.

I'm a computer programmer. My personal property *is* my means of production. There is literally no difference between the kinds of computers people program on and the kinds of computers people own as personal property.

Also, to recast this in the 19th Century concepts Marxists seem to favor: When does a personal property farm become a ""means of production""? When it's larger than a hectare? Two hectares? Ten square kilometers? When someone is hired on to help run it and harvest the crops? When two people are hired?

&gt; Also not all far leftists are opposed to religion either, for example Christian socialism and various forms of religious anarchism. 

I'm aware of them. They're even less relevant than the other forms of far-left thought.

&gt; I have no idea as to how you came to believe leftists hate the concept of family though.

[From Marx. As I said above](http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch02.htm):

&gt; The bourgeois family will vanish as a matter of course when its complement vanishes, and both will vanish with the vanishing of capital.

And I disagree, you're being way too general. Not all CMs play the same way, and not all styles of play have the ""CM"" position meaning the same thing. Pirlo and Yaya Toure are both technically ""CMs"" or ""DMs"", they're very different players. Suarez and Ibrahimovic are both ""Strikers"". David Luiz and Pique are both technically ""CBs"". The list goes on.

Yesterday and against Everton, Henderson's role wasn't to lunge in tackles and win the ball: That would have gotten us slaughtered. His job was to hold his position in the midfield along with Cou and to run around pressuring the players in order to cut off passing lanes. Not to win the ball necessarily. That forces the opposition into either backpasses which allow Sturridge and Suarez to pressure for the ball, or for them to make a mistake and a wayward pass into the traffic of Gerrard and the CBs. This was under BR's more counter-attacking style of play. The real question here is why the hell we would play like that against West Brom in the first place, though I'm thinking it's to accommodate Stevie playing (which I would've rather seen Allen in for). 

This is *very* different from the way he played back when Lucas or Allen was on the pitch, where he had the license to go after the ball and to move forward in possession more (think back to the Spurs game). He's more suited to the style we used against Tottenham and for most of the season, but that requires another midfielder who can play an *advanced* DM role who can run a greater length of the pitch. With Gerrard we have a DM that sits deeper, almost a 3rd CB dropping between the split pair of Skrtel and Toure, and doesn't move up the pitch as much. If Hendo went lunging in the setup we had, everytime he lost the ball we would leave huge gaps between him and Gerrard.

He looks like a shell of himself. If he can get a few goals against smaller sides to get him confidence up, I think he can be great for us. It takes some players a year to adapt to the prem.

2. Completely agree.

3. Hugo needs to cool it a bit but coming off of his line is still a valuable asset. We still play our line higher at times so he needs to be alert. I actually think that he saved a goal by rushing out against Hull. If he didn't, Jelevic would probably have had a great chance. Hugo made him rush and miss the chance.

4. I think a two man midfield of Paulinho and Dembele is the way to go against smaller teams. Swapping Capoue/Sandro for one of them against the big teams would be smart though. I consider Dembele a holding mid because he can play that role well if paired with Paulinho.

5. I disagree. Ade is great at dropping back and holding up the ball. Something that is vital to allowing men to get forward on counter attacks. He just needs to play it more quickly so we can launch something as he tends to dwell on the ball.

6. Lennon needs to be benched and sold IMO. He disappears most games and only creates a few chances. He really isn't a goal threat. Townsend and Lamela have much more potential and already have more dimensions to their game then Lennon.

NVQ 2 is the basic qualification, it can be obtained in 3-6 months under exceptional circumstances but usually takes a year or so. Any home taking you on without experience should ask you to work towards your NVQ.

We were lacking in the midfield today, on both sides of the ball.

And for the most part, we were very ""not City like"" in front of goal. Not wanting to put either of these issues on one particular person. Too many chances we could have finished but didn't. 

Now for the positives. As usual, we looked LETHAL when we got on the break. Just a case of not finishing. Also Navas and Hart had FANTASTIC matches. Every time I looked up, Navas was swinging one in or fighting for a corner. So much fun to watch him play. Joe in goal was tremendous today. There was no way on earth he was stopping that ball from going in the net. He was played back the ball constantly and not once did I think he distributed it poorly. 

Finally, let's take some solace in the fact that the Blue Boys were just as frustrated with that loss as we were. They didn't give up and fought till the end. That's what separates us from other clubs. We fight till the end.

It depends on how you mesure that gap...or if you believe the gap is the important issue.

The ideology is different for starters, the funding difference is massive. As well as this there are 2 major issues with the statement that you can believe or not...

Private schools are more successfully because they can in effect pick and choose the brightest/or most well if kids from nice happy backgrounds. And there is a belief that private schools lack the more rounded education that public schools do. I've heard people say they teach for university and not for life.

I agree with the OP that he has seriously struggled with the new league's pace and physicality, but I imagine he can be our Giroud... striker with moderate abilities who struggled season 1, then found his feet in season 2.

The problem is that neither AVB nor Sherwood have bothered to set up the teams in a way that plays to Soldado's strengths.

 Then we have Henderson who is really ready to step up IMO, Allen who still really hasn't been able to get an extended run in the team due to injury and his place in the squad, and Lucas, and obviously Gerrard can do the job down there aswell.

Although essentially the only reason why we're discussing this at all is because theres effectively one less space in the midfield, when Suarez/Sturrdige were out, respectively, we had Coutinho on the left side of the midfield and we had the extra space in midfield, that was taken by a real central midfielder. Coutinho does track back, however personally I would rather play Gerrard at DM, with Hendo and Allen ahead of him, with Coutinho, sterling, Suarez and Sturridge distributed over the 3 positions left.

Newcastle for me had an awful window.  Losing Cabaye will hurt them I think.  ManU would be close to that as I personally don't think Mata was worth 37M nor really at all what they needed.

Most interesting for me is Mitroglou at Fulham- very interested to see how he gets on.

However, credit where it's due, he is improving at a vast rate. He was tidy again yesterday but still looks forward too quickly when in position. He needs to learn to recycle the ball better.

Henderson is also only learning his role and it showed. Like Gerrard tactical awareness isn't one of his strong points. Yes he's learned a lot over the past 18 months but that's in a position as the advanced midfielder. He played as that advanced midfielder in a withdrawn role at the hawthorns. He harried and pressed and pressured when the ball came near but really didn't put a tackle in or track runners that well. Now with the strides he made in the advanced position after a rocky start, I could see him learn this role too. 

And that's important for him as Coutinho, while not at his very best yesterday, showed flashes and is showing more and more that he should be the advanced midfielder. Even his defensive work yesterday was much improved again as he closed down, harried, pressured just like Henderson would.

Also the point that the agent and chairman both highlighted lack of decisiveness by LFC? Bullshit, what they mean is that they overpriced their players and LFC didn't say yes but tried to negotiate what would be a better deal for Liverpool. I'd say that Liverpool were very decisive. They refused point blank to pay over the odds for players that were overvalued.

Also who is this guy? Elevenreds reborn? Liverpool were only after 1 player and it's a terrible transfer strategy? Hello Arjun Krishnan, when I get a picture of you, BR, Dave Fellows, Ayre, and that other guy we brought in from City, sitting around a table full of files on players, while drinking coffee then you can talk about transfer strategy and policy.

Also BR has always said he won't work with a Director of Football so bringing one in would be folly. I much prefer the idea of using a sporting director ala Real Madrid.

true,jcmosch,logo,,"I think holding Chelsea to one goal is a good result. They could have had more, but that argument for me doesn't do it, because it's a matter of finishing. If they finished better, they'd have have four. If we finished better (Silva 2x, Jovetic, Yaya 2x) we'd have had four. 

I'm a bit upset at our defensive resolve, to be honest. I've said it time and time again, but Nastasic is not a PL Champion CB at the moment. Demichelis is slow and left our defense about often, but it's clear that Kompany is world class and saves goals. It isn't that clear with Nastasic. 

The Fernandinho discussion is the same one as the Barry one last year. That man next to Yaya is integral. Ferna has been superb and could have provided a few forward looking passes and better placed through balls we didn't see from Demichelis.

tl;dr - Nastasic not good enough, Demichelis bad choice, finish better, we miss Ferna. ",0,1391476480,null,0,false,0,cf6dx1p,t3_1wxgbt,t1_cf6dx1p,t3_1wxgbt,null,1432240723,1,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,1

Also i think playing a 4-4-2 was a bad idea considering fernandinho was not in the squad, so you end up having no real cover except for Demichelis and yaya who roams forward and leaves a tonne of space behind him. Since Fernandinho was out and as chelsea have Matic-Ramires-Luiz we needed to play 5 in midfield.",0,1391477593,null,0,1391490797,0,cf6efp4,t3_1wxgbt,t1_cf6efp4,t3_1wxgbt,null,1432240968,1,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,1

The English private school system is almost ideal. It is the product of over five centuries of development. It produces, time and time again, a broad variety of young adults whose variety in interests and career paths is immense, yet linked by the fact that almost all will be successful. It even instils in them a deep and fundamental sense of public duty - hence why so many go into public service.

State schools are a relatively new concept. They are very flawed on the whole, limited by lack of ambition, poor feedstock and an uneasiness about the sometimes cruel reality of a meritocracy.

1. The Community Manifesto is still relevant.

2. When looking at means and mode of production it is important to consider the historical setting: industrialism. If you place yourself in that setting, you are possibly closer to an artisan than an industrialist. I doubt communists would dislike you. See Richard Sennet's 'The Craftsman' and possibly John Elster's theories on self-realisation. If you owned a load of computers and paid other programmers £7 an hour to type code in those computers, profiting from their labour, Marx would probably see that as falling within the industrial mould. If you, however, have your computer and use it to undertake labour of your choosing as an individual, I can't see why most communist would dislike that. Apart from exceptional unrealistic circumstances etc.

3. Quakers and others share a lot in common with Christian Anarchists, and there's a lot in general which can be learnt through familiarisation with Christian Anarchist texts. Tolstoy is a good starting point.

4. When you place Marx in a theoretical landscape you see that he is a Hegelian and is all about the dialectic. The point about the family isn't necessarily that it should be abandoned or abolished, but that within a communist society the current family structure will be obsolete. In a sense we have already seen the changing nature of the family within late capitalism; extended families living together are rare, and cohabitation is as much for pleasure and love as it is for reproduction. Dare I say it, gay marriage, cohabitation without children, and the nuclear family are probably examples of this. A Marxist would probably put these changing social trends down to the evolving economic base.

5. They definitely are against child labour. That one can be read as wrote!

&gt;We are a ""civilised"" country.

We were, but less now than before.

&gt;That's the whole point of having a welfare system. Our government and media have managed to convince the country its some sort of deviant activity to be unemployed or sick and in need of a system that you have contributed to.

Agree with all this.

And really really sorry to hear about your circumstances, I'm really crap about knowing what to say to people in your position (my own is more fortunate).  

It sounds really trite to say I hope you will talk to someone before doing anything so permanent and tragic, I'm sure you've already talked to far too many people about what sounds like a nightmare.  But, even though it's exhausting, being relentless about getting what you want and need does get results, eventually, a lot of the time.

At full back ideally we nee a new one on either flank. Johnson is injury prone now, as is enrique. We have Flano, Kelly and Wisdom who can play there with other young players as backup. 

CDM we definitely need someone. Someone who will be able to start ideally. Someone who is fit, strong, imposing, but can also pass well and press properly. 

CM we probably need another non defensive option. Unless we plan on playing Suso or Coutinho deeper and more centrally. 

Out wide we probably need 1 more wide man, we can't rely on Coutinho  and Sterling all season. 

Up top I think we're fine with SAS, Borini as a backup, and if we don't sell him, Aspas. 

So an LB, RB, CDM and a Winger is probably what we need. Maybe another CM if we get those other 4 positions filled first.

Regarding players out

Moses/Cissohko obviously end their loans never to come back. 
Aspas moved out, he can't play anywhere but up top(unlike Borini), and he won't get that at Liverpool.

They don't really seem to know what will work, and the moment a plan falters, they discard it willingly, only to hastily grab at the next ill thought-out plan.

In the space of a couple of years we go from sacking an old school, plain talking manager who was single-handedly responsible for getting us into regular Champions League conversation (Redknapp), replacing him with his antithesis - a complicated, obtuse young 'un with grand designs - and then replacing him with another manager in the Redknapp mould, and a complete newbie one at that, who has had neither the time nor experience to formulate a plan beyond ""hopefully I get 4th place and can stick around a bit longer"".

Where's the consistency of vision in all that?  At least Redknapp, for all his foibles, did bloody well with the squad at his disposal.  He didn't have anything like the kind of money we've just spent.

Sherwood, which this article clearly states, is only an interim man.  And then where does that leave us?  Van Gaal?  Taking a punt on some other young manager?

&gt;The **Tizard Mission** officially the **British Technical and Scientific Mission** was a [British](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) delegation that visited the [United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) during the [Second World War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II) in order to obtain the industrial resources to exploit the military potential of the [research and development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development) (R&amp;D) work completed by the UK up to the beginning of [World War II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II), but that Britain itself could not exploit due to the immediate requirements of war-related production. It received its popular name from the program's instigator, [Henry Tizard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Tizard). Tizard was a British scientist and chairman of the [Aeronautical Research Committee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeronautical_Research_Committee), which had propelled the [development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_radar) of [radar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar).

true,strolls,null,null,"The idea I find a bit dodgy is the one that kids' education exists in a vacuum - that we can improve kids' lives just by messing with the history curriculum and making them study longer hours. 

Meanwhile, many of the most disadvantaged are those whose parents are seen as prime targets for attack by other departments of the government.

Feckless scroungers are being sanctioned by the Job Centre more than ever, but its probably the kids that suffer, especially when the parents are junkies or alcoholics. I'm pretty sure we can find correlations between poverty and crime and violence - what effect will the cuts will have on kids?

It's hard to argue against the benefits cap, when those on benefits still get the equivalent of than the average wage for doing nothing, but imagine being the kid who has to go to school in charity shop clothes, knowing you're different from everyone else.

Imagine being 11 or 15 and acting as carer for your mum, who needs you to do the shopping and wipe her arse for her, and the ATOS decides she's fit for work and there's no money for months at a time.

There will be some who wish to reply to this, ""but there's help available for families like that"" - when I was 11 or 15, I had no idea where to turn for help.

I'm a ""leftie"", but I have some appreciation of austerity - we can't go on spending money forever, printing it or borrowing. I'm not an economist, so maybe things could have been done differently - maybe borrowing for 5 years would have been better than austerity, I don't know.

But let me agree with the Tories, for the sake of argument, that benefit cuts and ATOS and sanctions are ""fair"" and ""necessary"" - they will still have effects which will be seen for a generation. You can't just fix that by exhorting kids to work harder - not when their only role models are criminals and gang members, when they see no prospect of improving their own lot.

This is how big society really is - I mean big as an adjective there, not as some hijacked catch-phrase. Society is a big picture, and you can't just look at one piece of it and ignore everything else. You can't solve one social problem in isolation of all the other causes.

Private schools - one or two of which I attended myself - get top results not only because they can afford the best teachers, but also because their pupils' parents are themselves educated and want the best for them. I think that's what they call synergy - the teachers and the parents and the home life, multiple influences, all working together in this virtuous cycle. 

I dunno. I've been thinking recently about Duncan-Smith's famous ""epiphany"" on the Easterhouse estate, and how he didn't actually change his ways of a result of it. I've always been a bit of an admirer of St Paul, and how he's on the road to Damascus and how he gets sand in his eye, and he's blinded and disorientated, and lost for 3 days.

I mean, we don't all know what really happened to Paul, but he had this shitty, scary days-long experience, probably huddled and freezing his ass off on these cold desert nights, and he has some introspection and comes out of it realising what an asshole he was. He does a complete u-turn and changes his ways and his politics - he ditches his job and joins this criminal socialist-anarchist gang of so-called ""christians"".

That's the famous ""epiphany"" - the word literally means ""vision of God"", and that's what's supposed to have happened to old Paul on the road to Damascus. I think it's just a bit dodgy of Duncan-Smith's ""Easterhouse Epiphany"" to be marketed as such, when it didn't actually change any of his views. Instead it apparently reinforced them - he used what he saw to justify and rationalise what he believed already. 

We'd had two decades of ~~toryism~~ neo-liberalism - first Thatcher and then New Labour, two decades of flogging the horse. And I guess for a while that worked ok, but on the Easterhouse estate someone told Duncan-Smith the horse was dead. And he didn't go bury the horse, and get a new one, he has only gone on to beat it harder, a reaffirmation of the opinions he already held.

true,OKsoIneedAnAccount,lfc12,,"There's still plenty to complain about IMO. This isn't just about Ayre, but the whole transfer committee who as a whole has failed badly this window. That said, Ayre definitely needs to carry his fair share of the blame.

For example...

* Spending two months on Salah, only to let Chelsea run away with him in the last minute, possibly while embarrassing the club by vastly under-bidding in the process 
* Then go all in on Kono even though we didn't really need a winger, he wasn't even our first choice. To do this we send personnel essential to transfers (head scout, Dr Zaf, Ayre) to Ukraine for days, effectively stopping any REAL efforts for other players.
* Not going after a class DM, especially after Lucas got injured
* Not going after a class FB (while I understand there was effort to sign a 19 year old on deadline day, it's probably not exactly what we needed in this window)

Given that we have an almost unique opportunity to get CL this year, never mind a shot at the league, it's almost criminally negligent to not improve the squad. We're basically all in for a CL spot this season, and if we make it, we have the funds to attract better players (along with the promise of CL football). If we fail to get CL however, we won't attract these players and worse, Suarez may leave. 

From what I can tell, Ayre is doing a pretty good job with sponsors and commercial deals - I think we would be better off if he became a commercial director or something, and get a football guy in to deal with the transfers. Speaking of commercial deals, we announced 2 major deals in the middle of the transfer window. I have to assume that these were done and dusted ahead of time, I really, REALLY hope Ayre wasn't spending the first 2 weeks of the window working on Dunkin Airlines.

That said, we as fans obviously don't know the full truth of what's been going on. I think Ayre should not be the managing director of Liverpool Football Club. Then again, that's not an opinion I formed in this transfer window.",0,1391486850,null,0,false,0,cf6ipap,t3_1wvufp,t1_cf6ipap,t1_cf5ym05,null,1432243049,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5
