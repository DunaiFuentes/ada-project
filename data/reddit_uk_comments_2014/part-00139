true,Etular,eng-cumberland,Cumbria,"True, but at the same time, most people don't understand the nuances between paedophilia, hebephilia and ephebophilia - and partially, I think, that's part of the problem. They're all shoved under one label of ""paedophilia"", with its connotation of ""child-molester"", even when the individual/s in question may not be attracted to pre-pubescent individuals.

From my own perspective, as a gay man myself, I have a lot of sympathy towards such individuals - as others have said, for people having to suppress their sexuality for the betterment of society and being unable to receive help for doing so must be a miserable existence. Some will say ""Oh yeah? Well, they deserve it!"", but that's condemning people on virtue of their birth - on innate traits that they cannot change.

There is no legal outlet for such people. If I wanted to jack off, I would just flip up a gay pornographic website and jack away, not fearful of anyone hearing me. If they wanted to, they either have to use illegal methods at the risk of arrest and public/media condemnation; or use their imagination, fully aware that someone could overhear.

In essence, paedophilia in Western society is treated in a similar way, if not worse, than homosexuality is in Russia. It's probably not illegal over here for a person to ""come out"" as a paedophile, just like it isn't for a Russian to come out as a homosexual, but in both cases there's very much the risk of getting physically attacked for doing so and facing extreme disapproval.

* Lamela confirmed to be back in light training after a 'complex back injury' fucked this season up for him

* Getting rid of Sherwood - DL believes we need a manager who believes in our entertaining 'football philosophy', focus on getting the best out of current players and bringing through youth. 

* DL explains that Sherwood's short tenure 'was not felt to be out of kilter with most of the top flight, excepting Arsenal and formerly Man Utd. And certainly not with Europe, where standard contracts were for 2 seasons only.'

* DL describes top 4 as always an 'ambition' but recognises difficulty with 6 or 7 teams trying for it. Says that the EL is 'always taken seriously' and will be next season. 

* Safe standing overwhelmingly supported but to be focused on by the ST after new stadium is sorted

* No discussions yet about extending StubHub deal, but DL said such contacts were important when considering FFP rules

* Re. retiring Ledley's favoured no. 26, won't be retired but nor will it be assigned. Retiring it 'would be permanent and what would happen if Ledley’s son wants to play as Tottenham’s number 26 in future years?'

* Donna-Marie Cullen CONFIRMS all toilets are undergoing a makeover in the North, East and South stands for the start of next season!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

true,studavis,null,null,"UKIP are gaining a large amount of traction with people and in the media primarily on two policies - Stopping Immigration and Leaving the EU.

Whilst, on the whole, these are only perceived issues in the UK the two main parties, Labour and the Conservatives are seemingly burying their head in the sand on these two points - either ignoring them or adopting an 'everything is OK' attitude towards them. Sadly for them they are probably the two main policies which irk traditional British people (I won't go into why, that's another story in itself - but think of being an island country, the two World Wars and effectively running the world through an empire for 200 years).

As such, people are turning to UKIP in an attempt to sort these issues out for them, or at the very least bring them out to be debated and discussed. 

Brits are pretty much at the end of their tether with MPs (see job cuts / public service reductions / bankers being paid billions to fail whilst at the same time the MPs expenses scandals continue to roll on) and no matter what affiliation you are, trust in MPs to actually sort the country's problems out (as opposed to looking after themselves) is at an all time low.

Farage in all fairness to him has played this game very well. He knows what the majority of people in the lesser media savvy towns (who aren't featured by the media but hold big sway when it comes to voting time) really do see these as big issues to them. He's ignoring other policies because he can - the public mostly think that we're pretty much buggered no matter what. He's also got some quite rich (older) people who share his views to bankroll him on the campaign trail.

Labours / Cons response to UKIP is weak, consisting mostly of the 'ignore them and they'll go away' approach. Obviously this isn't working but they don't seem to have any other way to respond - probably too fearful of upsetting their traditionalist voters if they do take them on.

If Farage was a bit more controlling with his party and a bit more politically savvy (as opposed to media savvy) he could probably make more inroads than he's seeing now, which depending on how you see the whole debate is either a step forward or a step backwards.

City definitely subsidised his wages when he was on loan to us, and it was reported he was given a hefty signing on fee to compensate him for a drop in salary.  Do you have any source on the City paying his wages thing because I really want to know!

Optical Express in Cabot are the ""Bristol Retail Standard"" but there are other clinics too. The Bristol Eye Hospital for example have a dedicated clinic for laser surgery. But in any case, before choosing a place, you need to get a consultation. Not everyone can get laser surgery done. 

The consultation is mainly looking into your optical history, peripheral vision testing, measuring your interoccular pressure and 'mapping' the density of your lenses to make sure it will withstand laser surgery.

* Q1:  *""Do you think the UK should leave the EU fully?""*
* Q2:  *""Do you think the UK should leave the EU (political union) but remain in the EEA (single market)?""*

The polls results clearly show a significantly different result for both those questions albeit sans EEA specified. Let's go back to 1975 in time for a moment:

&gt;Q^1: **""Do you think the UK should stay in the European Community (Common Market)?""** ~1975

&gt;Q^2. Do you think the UK should stay in the European Community (""Ever Closer Political Union"")? ~ """"1975""""

1: Actual

2: Hypothetical

The question is of a difference that is seismic: An **economically**-significant question over a **politically**-significant question.

And here we are almost 40 years later with the Pro-Eu's desperately telling everyon that it is an economic question ie Clegg's 3m jobs will be lost and that is why you are anti-patriotic being an EU-sceptic, vs actually the question being a democratic decision if we exit the EU (political union) and enter the EEA (single market access).

History tells us that it is a democratic decision not an economic one:

1. EU Consitution = Lisbon Treaty (no referendum)
2. ECSC -&gt; EEC -&gt; EC -&gt; EU -&gt; Federal USE
3. 6 or so major treaties without any referendum on them
4. Many promises of referendums and x1 only.
5. Denial for most of the time from the ECSC to the EU that the end-game = Federal United States when documents prove this was always the objective since WWI no less.

We can also look back at documents from 1971 that tell us that the UK government of the time under a study knew this would be unprecedented loss of sovereignty joining the ""community"" that community law would take precedence over national laws of the land.

But on the other, what we've lost wasn't a good thing. What is being lost isn't local identity or cultural difference, but cultural norms imposed by central government on outlying areas.

Take France, for example. Until quite recently the central government suppressed regional languages. Now, though, regional languages (and the associated cultures) are having something of a renaissance around the borders with Spain, Belgium, and Germany and on their Celtic fringe. The sharp geographical divide between French language and culture and those of its neighbours is a very recent innovation imposed on those areas by people in Paris who have far less in common with those they imposed it on than their victims did with their neighbours across the border. Eroding the power of individual governments allows sub-national languages and cultures to re-emerge.

Of course, this doesn't even apply in some countries. France is an extreme example of the centralised state imposing culture.

Preferable to whom? I would say that the protesters or locals would rather the scheme be scrutinised by many different organisation, each with their own set of experiences and expertise, to make sure the planning conditions applied will be as rigourous as possible to ensure safe operation.

A fracking promoter might rather have the scheme go through a fast-tracked process, where one body (say pins) evaluates the scheme, with the ultimate decision coming down to one person (the SoS) who may or may not decide to go with it anyway, regardless of the opinions on the EA.

When a German or French student who can already read in their own language encounters a set of words written in English, say _""boat""_, _""boot""_ and _""but""_, their brains instantly parse them and they could pronounce them using the rules of their own language. Their challenge is to correctly pronounce the English sounds and to remember which one corresponds to which word, which they may still be learning the meaning of.

English children, on the other hand, can already pronounce the words _""boat""_, _""boot""_ and _""but""_ much better than any German or French student can ever hope to achieve in their lifetime. The difficulty the children face is to relate what use to be meaningless squiggles on a page to words they can already say and know the meaning of.

The advantage of a pension is you can pay into it pre-tax, along with employer matches and the option of salary sacrifice it can mean every £100 you put into the pension becomes £250 *before any gains* whereas with an ISA you put income after tax in so that hypothetical £100 is now only £60, obviously in this scenario £100 in your pension is many times the better decision.

A pension can only be accessed (assuming you don't become terminally ill) when you reach the retirement age which is currently 55, a pension is **very good** for long term retirement savings (hence the government provided tax benefits) but it's *only* suitable for long term. If you're saving to buy a house or non-pension retirement you'd be well suited to an ISA (S&amp;S not cash, a cash ISA is a waste).

You **must** save for retirement (a house should **not** make up the majority of your retirement) and a pension is (for most people) the **best** way to save for retirement. If you're in the minority an ISA might be better for your retirement savings, however from the information you've provided you should definitely be joining your employers pension scheme. Assuming they provide a contribution match (very likely) you're literally opting out of a pay rise!

The best thing you can do is seriously consider your retirement: when you want to retire, how much you think you'll need, then put together a plan based on that. If things change down the line, that's fine, your plan can adapt, but what you can't do is be 40 and make up for the 15 lost years of pension gains if you chose to opt out. Starting young is the best thing you can do, 26 is a good age.

true,bookwench,null,null,"I think to be born with or to develop the impulses to harm others is a tremendously difficult thing. I think people can change, and help from outside is one of the better ways to encourage this change, but it's nearly impossible to talk myself around to getting personally, actively involved in helping these folks because then I'm deliberately exposing myself to harm. 

It's the scorpion and the frog. The scorpion wants to cross the river, so he asks the frog to let him ride across on his back. The frog says, but you're a scorpion. You'll sting me. The scorpion says, I promise I'll be good. You'll have my life in your hands, after all. The frog, contemplating, agrees, and lets the scorpion onto his back. 

Halfway across the scorpion stings the frog. As they both drown, the frog asks: why? Now we're both dead. The scorpion replies, I couldn't help myself; it's in my nature. 


I don't think we're scorpions or frogs. I think, as humans, we're lucky enough to have self-determination and enough understanding of the world to actually change ourselves. But to deliberately change who you are, to utterly abandon some inherent part of yourself - a part of yourself which, in the darkest parts of your heart, you know you actually enjoy and derive pleasure from although you can never admit that to anyone else - how can you give up your pleasure? How can you punish yourself for something that you're convinced isn't your fault? It's incredibly difficult. Most people either don't want to or can't even begin the process; they'd rather be monsters than deliberately cut out parts of their own mind. 

The commonly used phrase ""be true to yourself"" comes to mind. It's a stupid phrase. A better one is ""find out who you want to be in this life and work on it every day."" Being true to yourself when you've got a significant chunk of you that's miserably evil, or completely useless, is shitty advice. Try to be better than yourself. Try to be more, greater. Be true to a goal, a passion, an ideal - something, anything except yourself. Be *honest* with yourself about yourself - acknowledge all the parts of you, and don't hate yourself for having them. It's not your fault. But you don't have to feed them. It does become your fault if you know you have a choice about making the bad parts stronger or weaker, and you choose to make them stronger. 

You might be the only person in the universe who knows what choices you make internally. You might think, well, nobody's going to know. But you'll know, and you'll feel that worm of shame, and you'll get defensive and make excuses and it'll feed back inside you. 
 
And don't ever mistake a desire for hurting someone else as some sort of strength or positive thing. It's popular in the media to show this as something which can be turned into a functional thing in society a la Dexter, but really you'll just end up as Doctor Horrible. It's not a strength. It's a mislabeled weakness. The upside to pedophilia is that the folks who have it can't really disguise their impulses to themselves as strengths; there's no way an adult having sex with children could possibly be considered strong. Instead, the mental argument is that it's natural and they're just the ones strong or smart enough to admit it. There's your mislabeling. 

(For a comparison argument, poison ivy is also natural, and we don't choose to grow that shit in the garden. Some natural impulses are stupid.)

I always had a very layman's understanding of geothermal as ""Pump in cold water, cold water runs over hot rock, water comes back hot"". 

But what's going on in this scheme is that the hot water was *always down there*, and it's pumped one-way to the surface, then once we've used the heat it drains to the sea.

So the geothermal aquifer is gradually emptying. What happens when there's no water left down there?

If you're gonna commit suicide, or fuck kids, then you need mental help.

The problem here doesn't lie with societies attitude. The problem lies with a broken and dysfunctional mental health system. Speaking from my personal experience, it's a shambles, didn't help at all and in face made me more tempted to harm myself. I understand the patient needs to corporate, but I've always done that, and time and time again I'm deemed mentally stable.

I mean, I fucking see hallucinations and have multiple suicide attempts under my belt, and I'm mentally stable?

You can't expect society to be tolerant of pedophiles, nor should you expect them to. Some people take pity as validation.

That said, it applies to both end of the spectrum. All this pedophilia business is ridiculous. My friend nearly got the cops called on him for sitting in a playground. It's not even like he was 40 or anything. He was 16, and branded a pedophile and abuser of special needs kids. All for sitting on a swing.

My point is, nobody should be either hostile or sympathetic to pedophile. It exists, it's a problem, so everyone should focus on the solution, which is without a doubt, a bette healthcare system.

Saw something on this, we (of course) are being a bit of a pain in the ass on these negotiations. If i remeber correctly we have offered a nice amount of cash for the property and even to help relocate the business....but the problem is the steelworks have pretty extensive needs for having the business being able to actually function and we are i no way taking that into account with the offer for the land.

Basically we have said ""here is a competitive price for just the land"" and not taken into account any of the costs associated with putting the company back into a functional state (cost of equipment, installation of equipment, safety set up etc) when moved.  Can't really blame the steelworks for effectively valuing the land at a higher price because of this concern seeing as the business has been in the same spot for quite awhile and the costs for the issues had already been absorbed by their business over the years and to start over would mean a high capital investment at the beginning....Both sides will have to compromise but at this point it sounds like both sides are digging in their heels.

&gt;DL explains that Sherwood's short tenure 'was not felt to be out of kilter with most of the top flight, excepting Arsenal and formerly Man Utd. And certainly not with Europe, where standard contracts were for 2 seasons only'

It doesn't change the frustration but i wish more people would keep this in mind when bitching about management turnover. Game has changed and all management jobs (like it or not) are effectively short term. 

Look at the average tenure of managers in England currently in just the top 4 divisions:

PL: 1.89 Seasons

Championship: 1.86 Seasons

League 1: 1.62 Seasons

League 2: 2.01 Seasons

I've been in a couple, and if the ones near you are anything like the ones near me the layout can be a bit of a pain.  Ground floor is one or two bedrooms, 1st floor is the living room and kitchen and second floor has more bedrooms and the bathroom.  If you need a piss in the middle of the night and you're on the ground floor it's two flights up and two flights back down.  Some of them also have the kitchen on a different floor to the eating area, so you've got carrying hot food up flights of stairs to deal with.  And if you have kids, chances are you'll have the living floor in between you, which depending on your outlook may or may not be a good thing.

The ones I've been in also had plasterboard walls between rooms rather than brick and were....not the best of quality builds.

Zab is a good example of another person who has that Captain's mentality.

I think he could be better, he could pick his moments to dive in a little more and he doesn't like players coming inside of him but these are criticisms that can be applied to most.  No player is ever perfect, even Messi can improve.

City do need another right back for a strange reason.  It's very rare that we need a player because we've had to chuck the rotational policy out of the window due to the exceptional advancement of one of them.  Richards has to go because he can't get the football he was getting simply because Zabaleta might be the most improved player in Europe over the past three seasons. 

I don't think there's a right back in world football who I would swap him for, not a single one.  Outside of Kompany I don't think there's another player in our squad who I can say that about.

He has several non-human senses centered around time, and in extreme situations was able to manipulate it even without a TARDIS. 

As a Classic Who fan from way back, I read that scene in *The End of the World* as being pivotal for the Doctor's character because he had been running around like a shell-shocked PTSD case up until that point, refusing to acknowledge or deal with the idea of the Time Lords being gone and himself, the only survivor.

Then, he's forced to pull out the Mad Tiem Lord Skillz to save the station, and it starts to move him forward a bit in his recovery (to the extent that he tells Rose about the Time War, etc.).

As to why it hasn't come up in the show subsequently, I put it down to different Doctors having different strengths and weaknesses (like the Seventh Doctor having better than usual telepathy, and the Eighth Doctor catching glimpses of people's futures when he looked at them).

I doubt very much it's about crime if they move in next to Farage's mansion, it about the stereotypes of Romanians as compared to say Germans which possesses all the traditional racist symbols (civilised vs. uncivilised, backwards, dirty etc.). You talk as if racism doesn’t contain elements of truth, it does, hence why it is believable at all. When the Nazi’s were propagating their racist campaign against the Jews they rarely lied, they simple used Jewish criminals etc. as symbols to feed into and reinforce their racist ideology, just like today with benefit fraud, it’s none of the media sensationalism we weekly see is false, but the ideology and opinion it feeds into (scroungers etc.) is since in reality most people on benefits are in work and out of millions only about 200 have the amount of children regularly reported across the media. Of course the benefits and immigration ideology feed into each other to create the social demon, 'the other', that class societies need.

This is racism pure and simple, I doubt he minds hearing German but when it's eastern European or, Arabic and so on, he ""feels uncomfortable"". It just the old racist policies about good and bad immigration, i.e. northern European good, rest of the world bad, of course the way they get round it is *de jure* equality, that is proclaiming immigration on skill whilst knowing that effectively bars the impoverished countries on most counts which are also the ones such racism is directed at.

It's not bad and it shouldn't be made illegal. Who said it is and it should? You don't need to be in a political union with another country for some of their migrants to move here and start up a business.

&gt; The problem with authoritarians is that they think the labour market (and the economy in general) is a zero sum game.

What are you talking about? How do authoritarians think the labour market and the economy in general, is a zero sum game? What do authoritarians have to do with it? Why did you edit your comment to change 'liberals' to 'authoritarians'? UKIP is not an authoritarian party, they're libertarian. Authoritarian parties tend to be more left-wing parties like labour or parties like the BNP.

It's so easy to play through pain for a short time without even thinking about it and have it catch up to you later.  Adrenaline is a hell of a thing.  A couple of personal examples:

I once got kicked in the nuts trying to win a ball.  I mean like the defender came in foot raised and I fucking ran into him dick first because I was looking at the ball in front of me as it bounced and not where his foot was.  He won the ball (and also the balls), but it slipped to a teammate and seeing the opportunity I made my run, received the pass, and scored.  Within 2 seconds of scoring I was crumpled on the ground from the nutshot wondering if my dick and/or balls had ruptured as I tried not to puke, but until the play ended I didn't even really register the pain after the initial ""oh that guy's boot just totally smushed my dick, OWIE!"".  I knew I took a right shot as soon as it happened, but just pushed that aside to finish the play.  

A more serious injury related one:  I fractured a metatarsal in the middle of a tournament final and didn't even realize I was seriously hurt until after the match.  I had some mild discomfort running around but it just felt like a bruise/someone stepped on my foot (what really happened is I took a shot and my follow-through kicked the bottom of a defender's boot, thankfully it was a sloppy effort with my weaker foot).  When we went to get our medals I started feeling a lot of pain and pressure in my foot to the point where I couldn't walk unsupported.

We're actually slowly getting better as a society. Also frequently worse, but mostly better overall. 

It'll be slow, though, and I don't think we'll see it in our lifetimes. 

As for history - there are some rather awful sex diaries and victorian porn books which I don't like to link to, but a couple short googles on the topic would bring them up. The writers (universally male) often described scenes from their childhood involving family and servants described as ""introductions to sex"" which today would be considered rape, then went on to describe themselves committing similar acts on young girls later in life as well as describing what we'd consider more normal sexual relations. Of course, the authenticity of these scenes can be seriously in doubt, given attitudes about the subject matter.

I think it varies from region to region, timeframe to timeframe, and situation to situation, but sexual abuse has always been there in much the same way bullying, murder, and infidelity are there. Common. We grew up as a species with it, it's a part of us, but that doesn't mean we have to keep it around or shouldn't fight it.

Townsend reminds me too much of a mix of Lennon and Defoe.  He is quick and can dribble, but he has been far too selfish with little end result.  Sure you can point at a few good instances of play, but there were far more examples of him doing the wrong thing.  Even when he had stopped shooting most of his crosses were completely blind (this is Lennon's problem too), so while he may have *looked* dangerous he never actually *was* dangerous.

Can he get better?  Probably.  Like I originally said though, I would not mind if he were sold.  He's had tons of loans and was never able to settle or impress, except for QPR where I thought he was overrated anyway.  To me that doesn't paint a good picture for him.  Right now his value is high and his production doesn't meet that value.  We have plenty of homegrown players so that isn't a concern.  We could easily pull a Caulker and sell high and replace him with someone who is a little more developed, and I'd call it good business.  I don't necessarily want to see him sold, but if the right buyer with the right price comes along I would take it.

Edit:  I'll add that I also would prefer Lamela and Chadli on either wing over him.  Depending on the system a more creative type would be good too - Eriksen on the left works very well with a more defensive LB and a DM for instance.

Forcing the debate to be had within increasingly narrow politically correct constraints had contributed to our current predicament with the political establishment.

I think largely UKIP have communicated their ideas in a PC way. It's the UKIP councillors who are the ones shittalking on reddit and Twitter in rather less eloquent language than you or I might use. UKIP could easily do more, for example by emphasising the current discriminatory policy of allowing unlimited EU immigration but restricting non-EU immigration. 

*""The right to free speech does not, and has not ever, extended to protection from the consequences of what you say.""*

While this is true, it's also true that the goalposts are continually shifting. The groups of people who are 'protected' from harmful speech are getting bigger and bigger. Not only in law, but drip-feed media reporting of people losing their careers over using the N-word, and the Twitter mob who are happy to hound people who don't share their views. This creates fear amongst people. Now, rights are not created in a vacuum. Increasing the rights of one group can only come at the expense of restricting the rights of another.

Now, there's a fine line between stating that Romanians have committed more crime in an area, and simply stating that they are more likely - I think Farage's point was based on the former, and I kind of understand where he is coming from. 

If someone is from from a very poor country, rife with corruption, bad social measures and generally low living conditions with little opportunity, it is logical to think that one will be more likely to turn to a life of crime, because there is simply little chance of one leading a good, happy life. This is not to blame the person themselves, and to imply that any nationality is somehow genetically built to be a bad person is xenophobic. 

However this *is* to blame their environment and the social and economic conditions they grew up in. It can be kind of related to Britain a little bit - specifically London. The poorest areas of London are also those that have the highest crime rates, e.g. Dagenham, Tower Hamelts etc. (http://www.met.police.uk/crimefigures/# + http://www.londonspovertyprofile.org.uk/key-facts/overview-of-london-boroughs/) *. It can be applied to most parts of the world, for example, collapsed cities like Detroit. People are affected more by their environment than anything else, and if you live in a crap environment, then you will turn to more drastic measures to try and escape it.

Just my 2 eurocents.


*though for some reason, crime in Westminster is the highest out of any other borough. Is this due to demonstrations outside parliament, or is it a very impoverished area?

EDIT: I hope people don't think I'm stating that poor, working class people are more likely to commit crime. This relates to the most extreme examples of poverty and bad environments, not places like Manchester or Leeds (though depending on which way you judge 'extreme' ;))

Exceptions come from a couple of things. Good nutritions is key- professional athletes already have to be on really strict diets to they put the right fuel into their bodies. When in recovery, the diet becomes even more specialized. They can also afford much higher quality doctors and medical techniques. This is why professional athletes tend to heal better.

In terms of *within* the professional world- like why Adrian Peterson could come back when Derrick Rose just can't catch a break- I would guess it all comes down to genetics.

true,Omblae,UnionFlag,Yorkshire - Honda Hornet CB600F,"Hello mate, basically the best way to do it is learn yourself - it's what I did and I was useless at car mechanics. Seeing as everything on the bike is much easier to access, it's way easier cutting your teeth on a motorcycle first. 

My local garage is great but charge something like £40 p/h, which really racks up in the longer jobs - I recently replaced my head bearings for about £20 parts and about four hours of my time. At the time the garage was quoting me something like £250+ due to the labour. All I did was use my Haynes and online guides and it was quite simple really - just a methodical process as with most mechanical things. 

Here's my recommendation - have a go at servicing the thing yourself but do it incrementally. So start by replacing the oil and changing the filter - will cost you about £30 for oil and filter, Ebay even does a good bulk jobby of filter + locking washer + oil + filter removal tool for not much more than that. Next have a go at changing the spark plugs, then bleeding the brakes etc. If you do it this way it seems way less daunting and will only take a couple of days maximum. 

Next take a look at this Youtube Channel: [Delboy's Garage](https://www.youtube.com/user/Moonfleet41)

This guy is the shit. He goes through the whole process of all the fundamental bits on your bike - like how to replace your chain/sprockets/brakes and he does it from the perspective of a layman despite being a highly technical mechanic. If you get stuck you can even message him and he'll reply to help you - I honestly give him credit for most of my mechanical know-how. 

Just have a go, start with the things it's hard to fuck up first like oil changes and just be aware that these things aren't as hard as they seem! ",0,1400256481,null,0,false,0,chjldlg,t3_25k365,t1_chjldlg,t3_25k365,null,1433824476,1,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,1

I don't understand what the problem is with not being able to say these words.  They're hateful and loaded with centuries of oppression, murder and bigotry.  I'm fine with not being able to use them and look down on people who do.  You cannot seriously use the 'free speech' argument to defend them and I also don't see how not being able to use these words somehow restricts the rights of others.

The police were accused of investigating anyone who was a nationalist, and although one man, Sion Aubrey Roberts, was convicted in 1993 of posting letter bombs, many other cases were unsolved. Thirty-eight M15 agents reportedly followed Mr Roberts, then a 21-year-old machinery operator from Anglesey, after he attended a nationalist parade in Caernarvon in 1991. Two other men, Alwyn Jones and George Taylor, became martyrs for the cause after they accidentally blew themselves up behind the library in Abergele, Conwy, while priming a bomb.

true,bookwench,null,null,"If you're asking what a psychopath should do... well. Why should a psychopath listen to me, is my first question? I've got an inherent bias towards my own self-preservation, which a psychopath isn't actually going to care about that much. My self-preservation and my personal desires for the society I live in would certainly conflict with a psychopath's desire to live a certain way, and they'd put little to no weight on what I say. I would only become credible when what I'm saying could provide them with some benefit: a more comfortable life, money, sex, power, fun. Whatever motivates them. Personally, I don't see much of a conflict between giving a psychopath what they want and my own desires in life. They can have their fun as long as it doesn't hurt anyone. I do care if it starts hurting people though. This is where basic social rewards/punishments come in. 

Psychopaths may lack the empathy that non-psychopaths have as a motivating factor, but they don't lack other motivating factors. (Psychopathy also exists on a spectrum; someone can be mildly psychopathic or strongly psychopathic. Mildly psychopathic people might feel empathy, just not to the degree healthy people do. Strongly psychopathic people might not feel empathy at all.) Bear in mind that ""psychopath"" is a non-medical term and the correct term is antisocial personality disorder. Doesn't have the same ring, nobody outside professionals really uses it. 

I'm also NOT a professional; you should take everything I say with a large grain of salt and do your own research or talk to a pro. 

Very simply, behaving in a socially acceptable manner is beneficial to them because it often allows them to be more personally comfortable. There are a lot of people who lack empathy to a psychopathic degree, but very few of these people end up violent or truly damaging; that's because there are lots of reasons to behave in society, and very few reasons not to. Like a mouse in a maze, even psychopaths learn in the pavlovian fashion: follow the rules, get a cookie; break the rules, electric shock. You can get almost everything you truly want in society simply by mostly complying with the obvious rules. 

If you mix ""psychopath"" in with ""also has a strong desire to do something socially unacceptable"" you have an internal conflict. Mouse wants cookie, but also wants to break the rules. So: how badly does the mouse want the cookie, and how badly does the mouse want to break the rules? All the drives come from inside the person. Or mouse. 

I'd say a psychopath looking for an excuse to misbehave could make up things like ""I'm a rebel"" and ""I don't care about their stupid rules, people are useless and hurting them is actually helping them"" and other stuff. A psychopath who's looking to follow rules and find reasons not to hurt people could make up excuses like ""that's hard work"" and ""I want to be strong, and giving into my own desires is weak"" and things which could be considered self-improvement. Note: psychopaths rarely consider others; almost all motivations for a psychopath will be internal and self-focused. Caring about others is not something they really enjoy or want to focus much on. Any time a psychopath does something nice for someone else, it's because it gives them something they personally want: attention, a feeling, whatever. Psychopaths don't do nice things for people out of any sort of goodness of their hearts, because that requires empathy and an understanding that other people have feelings and that feelings are important. This is why psychopaths who are functioning in society don't go to therapy: what's the point? They can already get everything they want. Why on earth would they want to add fucked up miserable painful feelings on top of that, when their life is perfectly good as it is?  

Anyways. In the end, it'll be on them what they want to do. It would be healthier, personally more comfortable and more sustainable long term to choose to not hurt people, but psychopaths are not often known for long-term thinking. I'd say part of this decision, to hurt or not to hurt, would come from the past life experiences of the psychopath in question. Have they learned that breaking rules causes problems, or have they been rewarded for it? Have they studied their own condition or are they unaware of it? Do they have enough of a grasp on tactical thinking to make long-term plans and follow through, or are they entirely motivated by their impulses? 

Not sure this answers your question; hope it helps. :)

Then you go on Milkround. Lots of graduate accountancy, law and actuarial jobs going. The problem is? Either ""320 - 340 UCAS Points or get the fuck out!"" or ""Sorry, we only do training contracts after you've sank thousands into a Legal Practice Course and possibly a Graduate Diploma in Law."" And this effectively means your degree is worth shit to many graduate employers because you didn't go to a top 20 university because your grades weren't near perfection in the two years of study prior to your degree.

I don't know who to trust anymore.

Bold statement to open with. Let's see if you can back it up.

&gt;The government sets the minimum wage, but it doesn't force companies to hire anyone at the minimum wage.

Right.

&gt;Companies aren't going to pay people more than they are worth, if they could do without these minimum wage workers they would.

Again, right.

&gt;The fact the still employ them shows their labour is worth at least as much as the minimum wage.

Well obviously their labour generates more than or equal to the sum of their costs otherwise they wouldn't be employed.

&gt; They labour isn't being massively over valued, it was being massively under valued before the minimum wage was brought in.

Not proven by your argument at all.

Take this example:

I'm random person X. There is no minimum wage. The value I generate by my labour is £10 per hour. I get paid £5 per hour, because if I were to quit there is a large body of other people who will work for £5 per hour. That is what the market value of my labour is.

Then the government comes along and institutes minimum wage of £6 per hour. Now my wage is artificially inflated. I am paid £6 per hour when in actuality the market value of my labour is £5 per hour. The fact that I generate £10 per hour is irrelevant as I can only do that in the context of GlobalSuperMegaCorp and the market rate for people who work for them's labour is £5.

This is what has happened. People are being paid more than the market value for their labour due to government's artificially increasing their wages.

That is to say, almost everyone on minimum wage is overpaid.

If we have the touted £50-60mil and we can make around £20mil (Lucas will apparently bring in £10.5mil alone) in player sales then that is around £70-80mil+ in signings based on speculation. 

Lallana: £20-25mil

Parejo: £20mil

Moreno: £15mil

Caulker: £5mil

Konoplyanka: £8-10mil? (Not sure about this one - he only has 1 year left on his contract) 

That would cost around £68-75mil, so possibly leaving us £5-12mil+ on a new first choice right back. Obviously this is all speculation.

So, every country not in the European common market has a ""very much authoritarian"" immigration policy and the EU has a ""very much authoritarian"" immigration policy for not opening up its borders to the rest of the world? 

In fact, [Labour wants to reduce non-EU immigration](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24193771) and the [Conservatives *are* reducing non-EU immigration](http://www.conservatives.com/Plan/CapWelfareReduceImmigration.aspx), making UKIP the most open towards non-EU immigration: ""[A look at the immigration policies of the four main parties show that actually, UKIP’s policy is the most open towards non-white migration.](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/nigel-farage-my-response-to-barbara-roche-9301378.html)""

&gt; You can't argue that because UKIP overall tend to be libertarian, every policy of theirs is.

I never said every one of their policies is? I also think Labour is a left-wing party, but I don't think every one of their policies is left-wing.

&gt; Not that UKIP are that libertarian anyway, as you chart appositely demonstrates.

Maybe, but (overall) they’re the most libertarian party to vote for.

&gt; Many of their other policies, like direct democracy have a distinctly authoritarian feel.

Let's face the brutal truth here - the mere accusation of being linked with saville have effectively cut these people's careers to a halt, most of them have suffered financially to the point of bankruptcy, the cruel irony of the emotional damage inflicted on them is unknown, at least one person has committed suicide. They may not be in a prison, but the mere accusation has essentially deprived them of a life worth living anyway. 

Do you want to be part of a society where this is standard and applauded? To have innocent people who have done nothing wrong, apart from to make a career out of nothing and watch it be taken away because of words and lies?  

I don't. We have a justice system that should protect the human rights of the defendant and properly work through each individual case - not trial by media, which is exactly what the CPS have turned Yewtree into, a witch hunt for the social media to act as judge, jury &amp; executioner - all before court. 

Look at the Rolf Harris case. The courts have not protected Harris's fundamental human rights - Everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial at which he has had all the guarantees necessary for his defence.

The trouble is, this is effectively a circle jerk on Reddit where people who already dislike UKIP and their policies feed into each other and end up in a broad consensus that Farage is indeed racist (which they believed all along anyway).

The flip side is, to the working and middle class voters in areas that have had high levels of immigration, there will be some *hard truths* in what he said. It is probably true that people are more wary of immigrants from places like Romania that have a not entirely undeserved reputation for crime and corruption - compared with immigrants from a place like Germany that are more likely to be here for specialist white-collar jobs. It's also true that public transport particularly in the large cities does tend to be disproportionately dominated by non English speaking immigrants. That's probably a reflection of both the volume and type of immigration large cities have had (i.e. mostly working class economic migrants from Eastern and Southern Europe).

Like all things, if your pro-immigration or live in the countryside it probably all seems a bit bizarre that anyone even pays lip service to Farage. But clearly 30% of the electorate aren't racist scum. I would urge you to put that to one side.

I don't know if that's a slight against university teaching or the privately schooled kids not being able to adapt. It could also be that state-schooled pupils are better prepared for the ways of general university life/teaching. 

However, Oxbridge is not like Cardiff or Oxford Brookes. The amount of tutoring is a lot higher, so may well be suited to those from that background. Further, I'd argue that the best of the privately schooled pupils will not be applying to Cardiff or Oxford Brookes, so there's a skew in the intake from the private background which wouldn't be so apparent from the state side of things. Would be nice to see data on the number of applications to Cardiff/Oxford Brookes from public/state schools - I had a quick look on the ucas website, it may well be there, but I've got better things to do with a Friday night!

I do agree with you that state-schooled kids are just as able and have the same potential, but I don't blame Oxford/Cambridge for not taking them when there are applicants who are more able to demonstrate their potential and ability, be it through coaching or otherwise. Plenty of state-schooled kids get into Oxbridge because they demonstrate that ability through their entrance exams, the unfairness is that they had to work far harder in order to pass them because they don't usually have much help with the prep.

&gt; Well, no, I'm right. I'm not sure where you're taking that from

I'm not sure when you say the system whether you mean the government in terms of tax revenues and services provided, or the economy/society as a whole. Either way, the amount someone gives into the system is not just the amount they earn, they are also adding value, supporting other jobs, contributing to the economy as a whole.

true,cathartis,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,"&gt; She was arrested at an illegal protest

The protest wasn't illegal. If she broke a law, they'd have found her guilty. They didn't. People in this country have a right to peaceful protest. 

&gt; But more importantly she did all this because she was unable to effect a change in parliament which in my eyes is just incompetence.

You have a good sense of humour. The only part of Parliament that can force through changes is the government. Other MPs, including hundreds of members of the Labour party, cannot get their way.

The point of the opposition is to raise questions, not to implement policy.

&gt; There is also accounts of her being uncooperative with police. 

OMG - there are reports. She's a politician - she argues her point for a living. So I'd imagine she made her case to the police. And police officers don't like people who talk back to them. So what?

I actually quite like having politicians who have principles they are prepared to stand behind, as opposed to the typical spineless toadies in the mainstream.

&gt; Yes they do, but comparing the sufragettes to anti fracking protests  is ridiculous. 

Back in the day that the sufragettes chained themselves to railings, people such as yourself had plenty of negative things to say about them. So the analogy seems quite apt.

&gt; The entire country is focused on her and the reputation of the Greens depends solely on her

Having a reputation for standing up for green principles won't hurt her a jot.

Any lease for a flat in London longer than 80 years can be renewed for a further 90 years after two years of having resided there for little more cost than the legal fees of doing so. Flats with a lease less than 80 years can still have the lease renewed if you've lived there for two years but it gets increasingly more expensive due to [Marriage Value](http://www.peterbarry.co.uk/blog/2011/jan/19/how-marriage-value-calculated/).

true,ppphhh,UnionFlag,CBF600N-Kent,"Wait until you're 19 and do the DAS, you'll be able to ride slightly bigger bikes at the cost of an extra test which you'll need to do at some point anyway. 125cc bikes are fine for around town but they're grim on an A-road, 70mph is optimistic, trust me. If you get a 125cc today you don't have to wait two years, just until you're 19, so it makes sense to just wait two months and go straight to a bigger bike, hard as it is to go that long without riding. 

That said, if you do get one your insurance is likely to be £500-£1000. It depends hugely on all sorts of factors which are rarely straightforward, but the biggest one is location. If you're in London it will cost you an arm and a leg. If you live in the middle of nowhere, less so. I think my insurance was £600 at 17 in a small town in Worcestershire and was £400 when I sold the bike three years later. My current 600cc bike is £300, go figure. Don't forget you'll have to pay tax and (if it's not new) MOT, which will cost about £20 and £50 respectively. Have an emergency fund ready for if something goes wrong with the bike. I highly recommend joining the AA or RAC too, you can probably join your parents' existing membership for cheap.

You need a helmet by law, all other gear is optional. You'd be a fool to ride without it though. Jacket and gloves are critical, boots too but sturdy normal boots will do in a pinch, as motorbike stuff is expensive. You should invest in trousers as well, although personally I skip them a lot. Road rash is bad news, but it can be fixed. You can't repair a shattered ankle or a mangled hand. Buy as much gear as you can afford. Prices vary but in general I would say £100 each for the helmet and jacket, and £50 each for gloves and boots is a reasonable place to start. Trousers about £100.

I ride with a helmet camera (Contour Roam, £120) and I'm glad I have it. It's not vital though and is more money, so I'd hold off on that unless funds aren't an issue. Buy waterproofs and remember that they will never truly work. *Buy a security chain*, a fucking massive one, and never leave your bike not chained to something if you're away from it for more than ten minutes. If there's no lampost to chain it to, wrap the chain round the rear wheel and swingarm. Ideally get an alarm for the bike too (or an alarmed disk lock), and if you're storing it outdoors get a cover. I recommend earplugs if you ever go over 40mph, it might not sound loud in your helmet but the dull roar of wind will fuck your ears up with enough exposure. 

This is a lot of stuff and might be a bit overwhelming, but that's how motorbikes are! You can do the above minus camera for probably £400, you don't have to buy everything all at once and you don't have to buy top-tier stuff from day one. Don't get a second hand helmet, but you could buy shitty used gloves now, then upgrade them when it gets colder in winter, for instance. 

Good luck and enjoy! It's worth it I promise you.

Well fair enough on that front. In this discussion I'm referring to governmental revenue vs. expenditure.

&gt;If you removed them, and left only the top 20-30%, the remaining people would be poorer not richer.

All cogs are important, but some are bigger than others :)

&gt;as others have said, not everyone can be CEOs or company owners you need ordinary workers too.

I never debated this.

&gt;So if you are trying to suggest the top 20-30% pays for the rest of society because they earn more and therefore pay more income taxes, this is incorrect.

They subsidise the services used by the lower 50% via their much higher levels of taxation paid. This is correct.

I wonder where James O'Brien lives and what race the majority of the people who surround him are. He seems incredibly out of touch with the problems Europe is facing in terms of immigration and true racism. 

But whatever, most of these speakers live in gated white communities and have no idea what it's like out of their bubble. I sure dont want to walk on a train and hear no English and see no white people in a country built up by white people and white culture- call me racist for that all you want, but having your countries race, language and culture destroyed isn't a nice thing to witness. 

Nigel is right about the immigration issues, you cant open the flood gates and expect good things. Watch rampant crime go up, rape go up, murders go up and watch as these so called ""minorities"" (not even real minorities as whites make up not even 10% of the planets population and are being systematically destroyed within their own countries) watch these so called ""minorities"" be at the centre of the problem. If you want to talk economy, talk about all these whites who are going to be displaced because they cant find jobs as immigrants keep flooding in driving up unemployment.  

It's already happening, and even talking about it or discussing the issue is now immediately shot down due to ""racism"" oh, how political correctness has seeped in. ﻿

true,alvinflundle,null,null,"**Man City statement:**  
Manchester City Football Club can confirm that at the end of the current financial year (May 31st) it is on course to financially break even, as planned.  
  
Operating with no debt, the Club is realising its football and commercial opportunities whilst continuing unprecedented investments in both youth development and the local community.  
  
From the outset, the Club has engaged with UEFA in its introduction of the Financial Fair Play Regulations in good faith and without prejudice and in a transparent and collaborative manner. The Club’s position is that it is beholden upon UEFA and the European football establishment to ensure the same.  
  
The Club can confirm that it has been in discussions with UEFA over the last month - in relation to the application of Financial Fair Play regulations  - as has been widely reported and communicated by UEFA.   At the heart of those discussions is a fundamental disagreement between the Club’s and UEFA’s respective interpretations of the FFP regulations on players purchased before 2010.  The Club believes it has complied with the FFP regulations on this and all other matters.  
  
In normal circumstances, the Club would wish to pursue its case and present its position through every avenue of recourse. However, our decision to do so must be balanced against the practical realities for our fans, for our partners and in the interests of the commercial operations of the Club.  
  
As a result of these considerations and the fact that the Club is now break even in in its operations, the Club has decided to enter into a compromise agreement with UEFA with the following practical outcomes:  
  
- MCFC will lose 10m Euros of its share of income from UEFA for competing in the Champions League completion in season 2013-14.  
- MCFC will lose 10m Euros of its share of income from UEFA for competing in the Champions League for season 2014-15.  
- Rather than having an accumulative allowance of 30m Euros of losses over the next two reporting years (like all other clubs), MCFC will have specific stipulated allowances for 2013-14 and 2014-15 of 20m Euros and 10m Euros respectively.  Significantly, MCFC plans to be profitable in 2014-15 and in the years that follow.  
- The MCFC Champions League squad for the 2014-15 competition will be limited to 21 players.  In 2013-14 the club registered 23 players for the competition and used 21.  
- The Club’s expenditure on new players for the upcoming summer transfer window, on top of income from players it might sell, will be limited to 60m euros. This will have no material impact on the Club’s planned transfer activity.  
- The wage bill of the whole club (playing and non-playing staff) for 2014-15 will need to remain at the same level as that of 2013-14 season. It is important to note that additional bonuses for performances can be paid outside this number. Importantly, in reality, the existing MCFC business plan sees a natural decline in that wage bill.  
- Given the unique nature of the new City Football Group structure – which incorporates MCFC, New York City, Melbourne Heart and a number of other companies, the Club has agreed to certain non-material terms in order to make FFP reporting as easy as possible for UEFA to discern.  
  
The nature of conditions that will result in the lifting of sanctions means that the Club expects to be operating without sanction or restriction at the commencement of the 2015-16 season.  
  
Importantly all non-financial sanctions agreed to would have been complied with as a natural course of the Club’s planned business operations.",0,1400267845,null,0,false,0,chjqr2n,t3_25qh0k,t1_chjqr2n,t3_25qh0k,null,1433827134,5,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,5

Postman have weight limits on their bags and trolleys. But if you have mail or parcels that turn up in the office in the morning, then delivery has to be attempted. They have vans.

The top comment by blozzerg is referring to the old system that not every delivery office has stopped yet. Bigger parcels/if one house got a lot of parcels they would be passed to a driver who deals with bulkier items. This was because under this system most postmen didn't have their own van so couldn't possibly take out big items.

Under the new system (but already a few years old) postmen go out in pairs sharing a van. They have to take all mail for their duties that day in that van and attempt delivery of it all. 

The reason they don't get delivered at the same time is because they don't all arrive in the office at the same time. Retailers don't all post their stuff on the same day. Then different methods take different times. Particularly if they've used downstream access which is probably the slowest method of posting parcels.

Real have the largest revenue of any football club in the world at something like 2-3x that of Liverpool per anum.

2) No players in England can be owned by 3rd parties. The club must own 100%. This was put into place when difficulties arose at West Ham regarding Tevez. It is often why good players will go to Russia or Portugal because it is legal and the owners of the player make a good chunk of change. That is also why players from Portugal can be very expensive, you have to buy the club owned portion and 3rd party. 

3) The only incentive the owners have to not spend the money on players is to increase their own financial wealth, pay off debt, or put the money towards infrastructure (stadium, training, youth Academy).

Inside of wardrobe doors if you haven't got much space. 

&gt;I will recommend nail polish thinner though! I've only had a couple turn gloopy on me, but it totally sorts them out.

Yeah I just got the Seche thinner, but the Seche itself is done with I think. I'll look up China Doll, thanks. 

&gt;Tried setting your liner with a powder? All I can think of.

Umm... not sure I understand. I'm using a primer, surely powder on top would blot out the colour?

&gt;Know anything about skincare? I bought some micellar water today, don't really know what the hell micellar water is, it removes makeup apparently.

Oh yes yes YES. I don't go anywhere without my Avene. When I'm feeling particularly lazy I use eye makeup remover and then a couple of large sprays of water and a few pads to wipe off makeup. And when my skin's particularly sensitive. I'm trying to get myself into the habit of using Pond's Cold Cream to cleanse my makeup off, but half the time I'm too lazy, and sometimes it brings up a few spots (but that regime will leave your skin glowing). If I have to use a somewhat harsher cleanser (it seems such a waste to just throw stuff away), I'll do a couple of sprays of it afterwards and pat it down, and it settles the skin down and returns it to a less aggravated state. 

It's good for instantly cooling your face down in summer, and for fixing makeup. I sometimes use it as a sort of makeup fixer. It's especially good for fixing dry patches of powder, and if your foundation/powder is a bit uneven or patchy for whatever reason, one long spray, leave it for 30 seconds, pat down, et viola, instant face fix (you then just smooth any particularly bad/uneven patches down a bit). Love it, LOVE it. Best invention since the stiletto. 

I'm on the hunt for the perfect lazy (i.e. not wash off) cleanser at the moment, so if you find anything great, do let me know. I got a Neutrogena one from the /r/SkincareAddiction top products list, but the one I got is pink grapefruit and it just feels a bit too harsh.

Also, all Avene products, all the time. Their cold cream is a great fix for particularly dry skin; sometimes I smother my hands in it and leave my hand gloves on for twenty minutes or so, and it instantly removes the OAP hands I suffer from.

If you really like spending money, Darphin make GREAT skincare products. I noticed you had a slight dry patch in your photo, sensitive skin? [This](http://www.darphin.co.uk/product/9112/21419/Skincare/Collections/Intral/Complimentary-Care/INTRAL-Cleansing-Milk/Sensitive-skin/index.tmpl) is the best cleanser I have ever used.

true,rydleo,null,null,"There's really no pressure from FSG to sell Suarez, particularly now that we've secured CL and the big jump in TV rights doesn't hurt either.  Last few years we've had a bit of a shortfall each season (roughly £40M in losses), but FSG have been fantastic in providing no interest loans to the club via UKSV to help cover that.  The downside is Liverpool now has a fair amount of debt owed back to FSG/UKSV, but at least it's interest free debt.  One slight negative about FSG is they haven't chosen to convert that debt into shares which is a bit disappointing.

Anyways, financially things are looking much better at the moment then they were in the past which means no real pressure to sell players, including Suarez.

Typically on transfers, the buying club contacts the player's agent to see if they are amenable to the move and get a feel for broadly what sort of package they would want to make the move.  If that is successful and/or everything checks out, the buying club may decide to make a bid to the selling club for the player.  If the bid was accepted, then the selling club will give the player permission to formally talk to the buying club directly.  If the player agrees terms and they (usually ) subsequently pass the buying clubs medical, then the player's registration will be passed to the buying club.  Obviously at any time the selling club can kill the deal by not agreeing terms, or, if agreed, the player can kill the deal if they're not interested or unable to agree terms with the buying club.

Other issues that crop up from time to time are 3rd party ownership of players, as you noted.  The FA does not allow 3rd party ownership, so if a player has such a situation then it must be resolved prior to the player transferring to a club in the PL. One indicator that a player might be moving on is if a team buys out a 3rd party owner.

Another issue that can crop up is the work permit.  Work permits are harder to get in England than other EU nations so that can scuttle some deals if a work permit can't be approved.  Irony there is the 'big clubs' (like ManU historically) can abuse the system a bit and get work permits approved for players while other clubs many struggle a bit.",0,1400273173,null,0,false,0,chjt7dd,t3_25qnep,t1_chjt7dd,t3_25qnep,null,1433828290,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

Perhaps if we increased investment in underdeveloped countries instead of increasing military and defense spending (as Farage and his party wish to) we could help improve countries which the population wish to escape in order to gain a better life so they could develop to a point where the population wish to stay and people from countries like the UK and Netherlands wish to move there for work.

With tax comes far higher prices I mean look at tobacco and alcohol people regularly bring loads back from holiday because it's cheaper and your friendly neighbour hood drug deal selling tax free stuff is going to be just as valuable then as he is now because he can under cut. Granted that's still all going to be illegal but the only way I see it being possible to get rid of the unlicenced dealers is to make sure the official legal stuff is significantly cheaper.

I just assumed you're using black. So a bit of black eyeshadow patted on top, kinda like how you'd set your foundation but, you know, black. I generally just stop using a product if it gives me panda eyes, so I don't know how to stop them, but I know that some people set their liner like that. Just a thought.


I actually don't have sensitive skin! I have oily/combination. I'm just never without spots. Usually only 1 or 2, thank god, but when they heal the skin around them goes dry and flaky. Being oily/combination, dry skin is not something I am prepared for. Basically, my skin hates me.

I force myself to wash my face every morning and night no matter what, so I can't really help with your quest for a lazy cleanser. I've collapsed into my bed absolutely hammered and *still* got back out of bed to wash my face. I just prefer to use a wash that foams because it makes me feel a lot cleaner. I remove my makeup with whatever remover I have and then use my Clinique Liquid Facial Soap. I'm using their 3-step system atm.

Gel nails are amazing and not amazing. I've only got gel polish, not the hard gel, so it's basically painting my nails and then not having to worry about them for a week or two. Which is great, I love it (usually end up taking them off out of boredom!) *but* my nails are weaker afterwards. It's because you need to gently file the top layer before you apply to give them a rough surface for the polish to bond, and then you soak in acetone to remove. If you've done it right it should lift off pretty easily but there's always some stubborn bits that stay and they have to be scraped off with an orange stick. So it's not great for your nails, but the pros outweigh the cons every so often, especially when I do a french. A normal french lasts 2 days max on me because the tips just chip so easily, especially at work, but the gel french lasts until I choose to take it off out of boredom or because the growth is just too much.

I don't see any harm in applying for this year. The worst that can happen is that you'll be rejected, and you haven't lost anything. Then, you can apply in 2015 via the traditional route starting in September if you wanted to go.

I think this is very agreeable. I remember when Nick Griffin appeared on question time and the audience would rather call him racist -which is probably true- and fling shite at him than discuss what he has to say; I remember a guy calling him 'Dick Griffin'.

The fact of the matter is that there are racial tensions in working class areas and that confronting these issues with an open mind rather than shooting down any right-winger and calling them racist is the way forward or we risk alienating otherwise moderate people who maybe feel uncomfortable with current immigration policies and making them side with extremists.

He has 64 and places 2nd in the entire team for this stat behind only Hazard. Schurrle has 29 which isn't bad but shows a large difference in comparison between the two. He may have only had 7 assists IIRC but this shows that he created a large amount of scoring opportunities this season and with a better striker he may have doubled that count.

As a vaguely leftie vaguely pacifist sort, the sheer vastness, in asbolute or % of GDP spending terms, of the US military, strikes me as vaguely abhorrent.

On the other hand, being also more cynical/pragmatist than idealist, it's very hard to get too far up that path of moral judgement without running into the realpolitik fact that UK/EU/NATO get a 'free ride' effect by being 'on your team' while you spend so much (more) to maintain such a bigger force that we can assume would pitch in if the shit really hit our fans.

I mean, in a world without NATO and the implicit threat of the US military stepping in, how much more bullish might Putin be over Ukraine?  to take just one example.

However - in reality the US mil is not just sitting there dissauding bad guys from trying anything rash in the first place, they're in active conflict, more or less permanently, in a series of consistently dubious conflicts, many of which could well be argued to _decrease_ our security, so my view sort of swings negative again.  Although obviously said dubious conflicts are down to the politicians not the average rank and file.

If you mean what do I think of the average rank and file, well I suspect some percentage of them are rather stupid, violent, obnoxious men with a headful of moronic, jingoistic nationalism and in all probability several other shades of -ism to boot.  Such is the way of armed forces throughout time and geography, I think.

The prevailing wisdom at the £5k level was that even if ISA interest was lower than savings after tax, it was often still worth it because in future tax years you couldn't retro-actively dump your savings back into an ISA for the benefits.

For example, I had built up an ISA balance of £13k and had kept it in the tax-free wrapper because if interest rates rose, it would take me three years to put it back into an ISA, but now I've taken advantage of the higher interest current accounts because if rates improve, I can put the whole lot back immediately.

Yet another thought on the unprecedented nature of this: £5k is just about reasonable to save in a year on a solid salary, whereas you need an exceptional salary to save £15k a year, so the only way you'll use this up year-on-year is if you get a lump sum windfall. Also worth pointing out the only purchase you'd save up more than £15k in short-term access is a house deposit, otherwise you're better off splitting the amount of short-term access and invest the rest in S&amp;S ISA.",0,1400277339,null,0,false,0,chjv045,t3_25qjf4,t1_chjv045,t1_chjuyi2,null,1433829136,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2

The mod 2 is on the road, so they take you on a mixture of roads to test your competence on the road.

As for self-employed, it depends. If you are a sole-trader, no, you pay 20% income tax like everyone else, and possibly a little more NI, but you can write off business expenses against your tax. 

On the other hand, if you're a Ltd company, you can pay yourself PAYE up to the NI earnings limit and then pay yourself in dividends.

true,thegreenmonstuh,CO,colombia,"It depends on the type of game. 

I like Schurrle when we are being more offensive and trying to score right away, like the games against Arsenal and City at SB. I really like his ability off the ball, he gets into good positions behind defenders and can finish pretty well. Also love how much width he gives us, which I think we often lack on the attack. His defense is not bad either.

Willian is amazing for games when we need to defend deep or when we are playing counter-attacking or possession, like against City at the Etihad or against Liverpool at Anfield.

1. President Obama lifted the ban on media coverage of caskets returning from over seas in 2009.

2. To say we don't ""glorify the dead"" i think is misguided. In the U.S. there is a cemetery called Arlington National Cemetery where soldiers, mostly marines, who were killed in action and veterans who have died of natural causes can elect to be buried in. Over 4 million people visited ANC last year, myself included.

3. To date, Between Iraq and Afghanistan exactly 6,800 American servicemen have been killed. Compare that to the 627 United Kingdom servicemen killed, i think you can see that we in the U.S. would have trouble having a ceremony like you point out for all of them. 

However, i am not trying to downplay the 627 British Servicemen who gave their lives alongside their American counterparts. Pictures of those ceremonies are pretty amazing am i honestly awed by that.

Reading all of these comments though does make me notice something: when i researched to find how many British Servicemen have been killed,  I feel almost obligated to say thank you to British Servicemen, both living and those fallen. maybe it's something that's been bred into me or beaten into me, one or the other, maybe both. Had those British Servicemen not served, there would have been, in their place, an American Serviceman. I think that's what makes me want to be thankful.

I do however, agree with many of the people in here. I don't want people to put on a pedestal i don't deserve. I don't want people to go out of their way for me. But i think Americans do it because they want to, not because they feel obligated. Maybe that's a difference between our cultures that we can't see eye to eye on.

I would like to say though, Brits and Americans tend to have much more in common than we do different, but we do a very good job of focusing on the differences.",0,1400278709,null,0,false,0,chjvk8x,t3_25qkvr,t1_chjvk8x,t1_chju5k3,null,1433829400,-9,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,-9

true,CuriousChloeUK,null,null,"&gt;Like all things, if your pro-immigration [...] it probably all seems a bit bizarre that anyone even pays lip service to Farage.

The odd thing about Farage is that he has stated that he doesn't want to stop immigration; he just wants to remove the free movement of people within the EU applying the UK. During his debates with Clegg he talked about how he wanted more Indian, Chinese and American immigrants coming over. If people think that UKIP is a silver bullet for *the immigration issue*, then based on what Farage as said, they're barking up the wrong tree.

We can argue over whether or not he just said that so as to not appear xenophobic (regardless of whether or not he is), but we should judge him on what he has said rather than what he might have meant.

&gt;The trouble is, this is effectively a circle jerk on Reddit where people who already dislike UKIP and their policies feed into each other and end up in a broad consensus that Farage is indeed racist

While it's true that it's easy to interpret UKIP policies as racist (and comments like Farage's about Romanian neighbours doesn't help this), that isn't the end of the issue. 

Farage believes that the EU would continue to be the primary target for UK exports even if we left the EU, but believes that we should leave the discussion table about the rules that our exports would be affected by (as exports to the EU would still be subject to EU legislation). Wouldn't that be even worse than the system at the minute where we have a say on the matter, even if we don't agree on every point?

UKIP have also misrepresented the number of UK jobs which are ""under treat"" by immigrants; they've stated that there are 28 million Romanian and Bulgarians poised to steal everyone's job, but there's no way the entirety of those countries are going to migrant to the UK. Or maybe the claim that we could ""potentially"" have half a billion migrants from the EU, it's a stupid thing to say because it would never happen; it's just a scare tactic.

Or maybe we could look at how Farage claims to not be a ""career politician"" despite him being first elected in the same election that Clegg was first elected (1999). Hell, he's been involved with politics at least since '93 when he was a founding member of UKIP after leaving the Conservative Party. Yet, according to Farage, Clegg is a career politician and Farage is the business minded saviour of politics.

I'm pro-immigration and pro-EU membership, which is why I wouldn't vote UKIP, but I think the falsities that UKIP and Farage have put forward are a good reason not to vote for them anyway.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;I'm guessing that's at current rates.

Depends who you listen to. There are mammoth quantities of gas under our feet, the real question is what we can get out for a reasonable cost.

Current estimates are that 10% of what's there could supply our current gas needs for 150 years. Replace Coal entirely with gas and that still gives about 80 years just from 10% of what's there. Early days yet so hard to say whether we can recover 5%, 10%, 20%, or even more, for a reasonable price.

&gt;Most of the country's electricity generation is currently coal

Not anymore chum, it's nat gas now.

&gt;Back to my point: If there's no alternative to keep the lights on, then perhaps fracking might be justified

We're facing a very severe problem in the UK. Electricity generation has dropped by about 40% in the last decade (which is, frankly, horrific). We're facing closing coal and nuclear power stations, don't have the time to get more nukes online before we face the real crisis, and so we don't have a huge number of options. We could try what the Germans did, increase our electricity prices massively, buy a load of renewables, and simultaneously make use of lots of coal because, frankly, that's what they've done. The alternative is we use comparatively clean natural gas from under our feet.

&gt; I don't hear anything about the need for such a vast infrastructure project, so I'm very concerned that all we are getting is more short termism that will just land us straight back where we started in a couple of decades.

Trust me, I am strongly opposed to short-termism in our energy policy. That said, right now we need a rapid solution to a problem which is approaching rapidly. That doesn't mean we can just abandon long term plans, but to say ""Let's not face the short term problem because it doesn't solve the long term one"" is like saying that taking a bus is stupid because you want a car. Sometimes you have to take the bus for a while, while you save up to buy the car.

We need natural gas for the next couple of decades. This can come from under our feet or it can come from imports. Those are the two options facing us, and anything else is totally unrealistic. During this time we *must* focus on building nuclear power plants, although I suspect once the impending electricity crisis is over many of the nuclear advocates will stop caring and the general public will get complacent again (one more reason to push ahead with nukes regardless of what they think).",0,1400280187,null,0,false,0,chjw5qm,t3_25p13z,t1_chjw5qm,t1_chjvsjv,null,1433829680,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Mynameisaw,yorkshire,West Yorkshire,"&gt;Struggling to buy weed is not a mental health issue, but it does appear to effect those that may have underlying mental health issues. I am not against legalisation but i think that people should stop thinking that it is harmless. In the same way that the drinks industry need to pull their finger out and support the issues that alcohol can induce i think that a legalised weed industry should do the same. 

I agree entirely.

The current situation is very destructive, having had a few months of dependancy on weed I can't explain the feeling of not knowing when you'll get a draw.

A legalised market would remove this effect entirely which could be significant, I know I was pretty depressed at points which was made worse by that single situation.

Not to mention cost, the current £10 / 1g is a ridiculous markup. For heavy dependent smokers this can cause serious financial issues when 2g (or £20) can go in a single evening. 

These concerns would not be as prevalent under a legalised market. And hopefully a legalised market would open the door to proper help and support for dependent users.

&gt;i found this quote “The results of the current study suggest that having an increased familial morbid risk for schizophrenia may be the underlying basis for schizophrenia in cannabis users and not cannabis use by itself,”.

I think this is the crux of the issue, weed inherently is fairly harmless, the individual components can't cause serious harm. However, when you add the complexity of the human brain in to the equation then you end up with it being the spark to a much more serious issue.

&gt;Again, i am not saying that i am against it at all, just that something that plays with the chemicals in your brain like it does is most likely not going to be without consequence in the long term.

I truly believe we can challenge at the highest level under Bobby and I know for a fact that the youngsters will play a huge role in that.",0,1400281589,null,0,false,0,chjwphg,t3_25qcrd,t1_chjwphg,t1_chjt8zg,null,1433830021,9,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,9

But they have abandoned this http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2014/04/how-ukip-turning-left-economy

UKIP I think were initially a reaction to the concept of a foreign government (the EU itself) having rule over Britain. This is ultimately a pretty marginal issue, because at the end of the day it didnt make a huge difference to us. 

When they really came in was when Labour opened the doors to unlimited migration from Eastern Europe, which most other countries rejected. We acquired 2.5 million Eastern European migrants, who were very visible, often working in service jobs. They represent competition for employment, housing and welfare. 

This wave of migration is absolutely what UKIP is about. Everything else, to be honest, is up for grabs. They are a populist movement, and I think they had their 2010 manifesto written by a hard line free market type, without any real oversight, which perhaps is unsurprising given that they stood no chance of winning even one seat in 2010. Their leader has said 'hang on, people don't actually want to throw out employee rights', and a lot of this stuff has been unceremoniously dumped.

At the same time, as an ultimately xenophobic movement, they attract a lot of pretty bigoted people. These people would historically have fit in very well in the Conservative Party, but are no longer socially acceptable there, at least publicly. So they have come to UKIP, which has a kind of 'no political correctness' mantra (which is allied to the anti immigration stuff), so they make them candidates, at least until the media find out and they end up looking stupid.

Basically what they need is more discipline and pragmatism. Anti immigration parties such as the BNP, NF and others were always tainted with violence and antisemitism, and could never hope for more than that. 

UKIP aren't in that position, they've already dumped the wingnut economic stuff, but their tendency to attract intemperate old bigots is something that needs to be controlled. Steer clear of gay marriage and other inconsequential stuff and stick to the message of controlling immigration, but without making any racist generalisations.

true,CuriousChloeUK,null,null,"&gt;There is a big difference between doctors from harvard, and itinerant scrap metal dealers from Romania.

If there's a position available, it doesn't matter if it's a skilled role or a non-skilled role; it still needs someone to fill it. Being in the EU makes it easier to fill such positions, especially ones that UK citizens are less willing to take up (like intensive labour on farmland). 

Being Romanian doesn't make someone less likely to do a good job in the UK, but we have systems in place to assist in getting EU citizens into our workforce that don't exist for other countries. 

We could do with having more systems to make it easier for non-EU citizens to come over and work in the UK (e.g. your Harvard doctor), but that's going to be a long and drawn out process.

America's absolutely got the right to have a military proportional to its wealth--but the US military is utterly disproportional. Its budget could be cut in half to pay for healthcare and education for the entire US population and it'd still be better funded than all its rivals put together. Comparing it to the UK's proportional yet still very capable military, that irks me, as do the high rates of rape and suicide in the American military that I've read about.

That said, every American serviceman (every American in fact) that I've met has been a credit to the country. I can't hold the same ill will against the individuals that I do against the institution and the US foreign policy. I get the impression that the UK armed forces are in general more professional, but that's based on what I've heard from Brits, and it's probably a consequence of being a smaller organisation which can be more picky when it comes to recruitment. The US military is obviously still one of the best in that regard.

Unfit braindead gung-ho fat bastards who whine about absolutely anything and everything and who I wouldn't want to be within a mile of such is their level of ""professionalism."" The safest place to be is at least a mile behind them.

Here's an example of just how far behind the US military is in regards to fitness requirements. Did you know the qualifying pass time for the 3 mile run in the US Marine semi-annual basic fitness test wouldn't even be a pass for a WOMAN playing in the Army Band in the British Armed Forces?

http://usmilitary.about.com/od/marines/l/blfitmale.htm

3 mile run: The maximum pass time is 33 minutes. You can WALK 3 miles in 33 minutes.

In the British Army we do the same test with you running as a squad for the first 1.5 miles in 14 minutes then a timed individual sprint to the finish. Anything over 10.30, taking the 3 mile time to 24:30 for a man is a fail, anything over 11.30, taking the 3 mile time to 25:30 for a woman is a fail.

US Marines can take between 28:00 to 33:00 depending on age, a whole 2.5 to 7.5 minutes longer than a WOMAN in the British Army band.

The Latin term should be idesexual, where idem means same (opposite altersexual).

Liverpool really want Adam Lallana and they value him at £20 million, which is my opinion is a fair price. Southampton are playing hard ball and are requesting £25-30 million. Liverpool basically say 'Stuff that, but we will have Lovren please'. Then the media are saying we are now in for Shaqiri, who I think is a fantastic winger. Either they want them both or only 1 remains to be seen, but this does increase pressure on Southampton to sell (pressure from Lallana's camp because I'm fairly sure he wants this Liverpool move, what attack-minded player wouldn't want to play for Liverpool right now?). It's different for Moreno, he is clearly our top left back choice (Echo) and there are rumours Madrid are interested. He may be stalling and waiting to see if Madrid come calling, so Liverpool push this Bertrand story out which may be believable in the hope to force Moreno's hand. 

TL;DR - These rumours are likely to be put out from Liverpool in order to pressure Southampton to sell at Liverpool's price.

Newton and Darwin are probably the most famous scientists, although Turing has had quite a bit of publicity recently with the pardon and a campagin to get him on the new £5 (or possibly £10, I can't remember) note, which sadly failed.

Shakespeare and Dickens are the most famous writers I'd say. Other writers are covered in schools, but they're probably the most remembered.

Robert Burns is especially well remembered in Scotland, and is probably the only one here that actually has a [holiday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burns_Night) of sorts. You don't get time off for it or anything, though.

Freddie Mercury is probably the most famous 'historical' musician. Elgar, famous for Land of Hope and Glory ([video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tLL1Gk4gww), with bonus rare example of flag-waving Brits) is the only other one that springs to mind, and to be honest I don't think he'd be as well known as Freddie Mercury.

As for Americans... I wouldn't say there were any we'd consider national heroes, mainly because by definition they're not British.

George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt and Eisenhower are probably the best known presidents. Probably JFK too, although mainly because of the assassination.

Thomas Edison and possibly Nikola Tesla are the only other well-known historical Americans that I can think of right now.

Give it a few minutes, someone will probably post some painfully obvious ones that have slipped my mind.

Edit: And I'm thinking of some already.

true,thaumatropia,null,null,"I'm American. I first became interested in the Premier League about 12 years ago. At the time I was dating a girl from the UK (at the time she was living in Bristol), and she was a lifelong fan of another Premier League club who I shall not name here, and I sort of became a casual fan. I was young, and new to the league, and didn't know any better.

We broke up a year later, and for a year or so I avoided anything and everything British (like I said, I was young). I came back to the league eventually but decided I didn't really feel a connection to that club, and the negative associations just put me off. So I followed the League but not any club for a couple of years. 

I started getting into Liverpool towards the end of 2008-09, when there was still a chance they could snag the title. I wasn't a fan as such, but I kept tabs on them.

Then I started watching John Green on YouTube, and he talked about his love for Liverpool in several videos. Somehow I hadn't managed to watch Istanbul by this point, so I found a torrent of it and watched. The tipping point in terms of emotional attachment came during those few months under Hodgson, when it looked like we might get relegated, and then seeing Kenny come in mid-season and pick the club up by the scruff of the neck to finish as high as they did.

That said, this is the first season where I've been able to watch every single game (thanks NBC!), whereas in previous seasons I either had to find a janky stream or just get the score later (usually the latter). So in a way this *feels* like my first season, even though I've been onboard for the past five years. This is also the first season in which I've been engaged in the broader supporter community, which has been *mostly* positive.",0,1400289890,null,0,false,0,chjzs8t,t3_25qxph,t1_chjzs8t,t3_25qxph,null,1433831466,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

I remember watching a game where John Barnes pulled his opponents shirt so badly that he ended up with the collar in his yet. Even more bizarrely, he proceeded to plead his innocence to the ref with said collar still in hand.

I remember staying up late to watch the Liverpool 4-3 Newcastle game where Collymore scored the winner if memory serves me right. I think Fowler came on as a sub and scored merely instantaneously or am I getting muddled with the Alaves final.

I remember hating Mark Wright for costing us the FA Cup final against United. I naively believed he ducked out of the way of the goal-ward bound shot. Collymore was one of my favourites.. the innocence of youth ;)

Its a family affair now. My whole family supports LFC and most matches are streamed at my house while doing a Skype video call with my brother in Korea. I have a dual screen setup so we can stream on one side and he gets to feel like his in the living room watching the mighty Reds with us.

Growing up most kids supported United. I think its because the Premier League started gaining a global audience then and they were already winning leagues. I got into a number of fights at school with guys who took the LFC shredding too far(Not proud, it just is what it is.).

It feels like Europe collectively moved past the need to be ""patriotic"" after WW2. Not that I don't respect soldiers, but they're ultimately just a labour force following the instructions of higher ups, whilst heroic acts in the face of adversity are noble, there is no default nobility in being in a military. I really hope that in the future a national hegemon will not exist, and that a supranational power will take it's place.

The reason those fullbacks you listed stayed good into their thirties is because they are true defenders. They have better instincts, awareness, sense for positioning, and have all the defensive skills necessary to play the position without being really fast (Zabaleta anyone?). Also, Glen is already an injury prone player which is a red flag as he ages. It's for this reason that I wouldn't mind Sagna on a free if there are no other options and I would start a **healthy** Sagna over Glen.

true,shotglass21,eng-GreaterLondon,London AKA civilisation,"It's ironic how people in the UK will vilify Germans for taking pride in their Nazi history and Russians for boasting about the USSR and their atrocities, but yet some Brits will do the same thing when it comes to British Empire. The British Empire carried out a lot of atrocities and vile acts across the globe which shouldn't be forgotten, nor should they be glorified. 

&gt;  How dare we deploy our colonial navy to stop the slave trade,

You do realise that Britain was one of the biggest players in the slave trade for over two centuries right? The native people of the land that was taken over by the British, were subjugated and treated as second class citizens in their land, this was especially true in places like Canada and Australia; this is the poison that is known as imperialism. The main reason the empire existed in the first place, was to benefit the UK at the indigenous people's expense. 

There are many things we can be proud of in this country; the British empire certainly shouldn't be one of them.  ",1,1400293544,null,0,1400296354,0,chk13r3,t3_25qtz7,t1_chk13r3,t1_chjy58q,null,1433832088,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,robdabank,JE,jersey,"I like that Schurrle shoots more, and when he does shoot they're more likely to be on target. Of course someone could probably check Opta and compare the two to either refute or substantiate my claim, but from what I've seen Schurrle likes to get in to space or create it for himself and then take a chance.

That being said, that's what I liked about Sturridge. He was criticized for being selfish with the ball at times, but he took shots often. And when you're down a goal in the second half or it's tied up, the guy trying to work into space or open a gap up for himself to have a strike is encouraging (of course that can go the other way for morale if he's constantly putting the ball wide or too high).

Willian seems to have the same sort of athleticism as Ramires in that he just keeps running which is good as well. 

I don't think you can really reduce it to an either or in terms of who starts. If you're going to play a team that is going to dig in defensively, maybe play Schurrle, he seems more likely to be the person who scores a goal from outside the penalty area without having to weave through a thicket of defenders.

If you're playing a team that requires someone who won't get tired running down guys with the ball / tracking back and sprinting up the field every 90 seconds, maybe play Willian. 

I'm not a manager, so don't listen to me.

Basically, you get your ballot paper and you rank the candidates in order of preference (1, 2, 3 etc.). You can rank as many or as few as you like. The first preference votes are then all counted up, and if any candidate has made the quota they are elected. If there are still seats left to be filled the candidate with the lowest number of votes is eliminated and their votes redistributed according to lower preferences. This continues until all seats are filled.

&gt;The __single transferable vote__ (__STV__) is a [voting system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_system) designed to achieve [proportional representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation) through [ranked voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting_systems) in multi-seat [constituencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district) (voting districts).  Under STV, an elector has a single vote that is initially allocated to his or her most preferred candidate and, as the count proceeds and candidates are either elected or eliminated, is transferred to other candidates according to the voter's stated preferences, in proportion to any surplus or discarded votes. The exact method of reapportioning votes can vary (see Counting methods).

Got deep there! A deep question deserves a deep response in my book. 

Well, I suppose it depends on if you're talking about friendships, family, romantic relationships, colleagues at work, etc.

Ultimately, to get there, in my opinion, a group has to be bonded together by a single cause or goal and be determined to achieve that cause or goal.

In the case of LFC, we have gotten to a point where a leader like Brendan Rodgers has created this way of thinking, this philosophy that everything each individual does - from the tea lady in the canteen to Premier League Golden Boot winner Luis Suarez - is for the greater good of the club.

And that is why the latest quotes from Luis Suarez are really intriguing... If I read between the lines, I think he is genuinely *buying into the philosophy* that Rodgers has established (or re-established) at the club.

Sure, Real Madrid, Man City, PSG, etc. do it a different way (i.e. spend a ton, create amazing fantasy football squads) and still achieve success and, whatever, that's OK too ... but what is more seductive is being part of something that feels so much more organic.

And I think that's what we're building at Liverpool FC and I think Suarez is realizing that he is an integral part of what makes this club special and an integral part of turning something 'special' into something legendary.

Here's a quick summary:

Islam is a religion. 

Islamism is a political ideology. 

If you look at the justifications for islamism you will find they are derived from the ideas of marxism/leninism (vanguardism) and georg hegel (hegelian dialectic), western philosophers, and not from the koran.

Also the relationship between the jihadist organisations and the western security agencies is murky as fuck.

I recommend this lecture on Jihad to the LSE by Gilles Kepel who is probably the leading academic expert on the subject of islamic terrorism.

Personally, I think Guly and Hooiveld would follow him. Maybe Danny Fox too, but he's at Forest now. If you're lucky, Gazzaniga. 

In all seriousness, no.

You won't be getting Lallana, Shaw, Clyne, or anyone because of Poch probably. Keep in mind he's only been at Southampton since early 2013. In comparison, Lallana's been here for roughly eight times longer than that and has seen a lot more managers come and go. 

As for if he leaves, I'll toss my opinion in on that. I think Poch values a strong chairman/manager relationship, and is drawn to any club that can offer consistency/security in that. He's also a bit of a project guy it seems, and I think if he leaves Southampton it will not be because another club offers what we can give him, but instead because the new chairman Ralph Krueger won't be able to keep him. 

When it comes to Spurs, Levy is where I become immediately skeptical of all the Spurs rumors more than any other club that's been linked to him. The guy plays a lot of youth players, has his own certain types of transfer targets, and seems to like stability. If Spurs can provide that, and Levy can canoodle him into more than a one or two year contract, he'd probably be a great fit for your squad, but forgive me for being immediately skeptical that that would be possible given the last few years.

You need to have done something pretty momentous for that to happen. Probably one of the main reasons is that America was born out of a revolution. The United Kingdom came about by evolution.

And in fact you could easily say that the US Civil War was also another revolution of kinds, and that Martin Luther King's ideas were revolutionary in that they changed the entire country. So in that way the US is entitled to venerate Washington, Lincoln, and MLK, and have days dedicated to each man.

Awestruck and in love with the charismatic player, I found out that he played for a club called Liverpool. I started to follow them in bits and pieces around 1999-2000. In India, the Premier League was atleast 5-6 years away from getting regular broadcasting and the insane popularity it enjoys today, but I used to follow most of the match reports on paper. The 12 year old me ruined the walls of my room with paper cut outs of Micheael Owen celebrating post goals because I could not afford posters. Cheers to my parents for never stopping me because they realized their son was falling in love with the game because of this one person.

When Owen left, I cried. I shut the door of the room and didn't eat for two days. It felt as if my idol had just betrayed me.  However, the conection to Liverpool was strong at that point. One of the prime reason was Steven Gerrard who I valued next to Owen. Broadcasting rolled in around 2004 and I never looked back. Liverpool was my fuel to shut out the world as I continued to revel in their success. Then came 2005. Istanbul. The rest, as they say, is history.

As for Owen, I followed him at every step, from Real Madrid to Newcastle, to United and then Stoke City :( He is and will continue to be the reason I fell in love with Liverpool and the game and will be like no other. When he scored 100 goals, a maganize gave a door sized poster of him celebrating in a Liverpool kit, with the words ""100 And Counting"". Several years later, I still hang that poster on my door today. Owen in a Liverpool kit, I would have it no other way.

The Comedy Combo at the Cube Cinema in Stokes Croft is great but has quite a long waiting list so it might be worth booking a spot now for 6 months down the line. You can email marian@cubecinema.com. There's also a brilliant night called Hill-arity at The Hill pub in Cotham which is run by the Bristol University Improv society. I did my first ever gig in Bristol there and got a lovely response. Get in touch with Joe Hesketh on facebook for that one. It's also a good idea to join the Facebook groups called Giggle Byte and The South West Comedy Circuit. There'll be loads of people there who can give you advice. Good luck and welcome to the Bristol Comedy scene!

On top of that, LP at the time wasn't your Man U, Chelsea, and Man City who everyone in the US seems to be a ""huge fan of since forever"". Like A&amp;M, they had their past successes but were in a funk.

Gove has decided that our current curriculum isn't challenging enough because kids don't know enough grammar and also it's not like the one taught in private schools. So he has pushed for changes, to bring state schools in line with private schools.

While I think this is a noble gestures and if we could ever have parity it would be amazing but we all know that when you sink personal money into something you expect more back because... you know... funding.

Anyway, this current curriculum change included his demand that we no longer teach poetry from across the ages but just Romanticism (because it's his favourite and I kid you not. He wanted us to focus on his favourite poet until people pointed out the ridiculousness of that.) He also wants a greater emphasis on spelling, puncuation and grammar (which I am all for). But, I think what bothers me most about this particular set of revisions is twofold. 1) He is quoted at as saying ""They demand more from all students and provide further challenge for those aiming to achieve top grades"" - what about the rest of the year? and 2) His insistence that all writers covered are from the UK - no cultural diversity there then.

Every time curriculum changes we have to adjust. I don't have issues per se but the government has them roll out asap which means we often don't get the new information until summer giving us very little time to get to grips with and plan for this entirely new course. 

Yes, teaching, in essence, doesn't change and put me in the classroom and I am fine. But outside of it...

Gove demeans teachers at every turn. He belittles us and our students. He lowers the profile of teaching and then wonders why there's no respect and no drive for younger people to become teachers. 

He has added in so many layers of detail for data that more and more of my time is being swallowed up by data inputting. And what suffers? Innovative classroom lessons of course because I don't have time to plan and prep them. 

He believes private schools are the only schools worth attending and yet criticises state teachers who teach is similar didactic methods to their private school counterparts. 

He asks us to provide in the same way but has cut funding for so much that schools are forced to make more and more people redundant, and we don't have the money for facilities that private schools can offer. He tells us that the only difference is in teaching but forgets that there's a huge gap between Private Kid A whose parents are hugely invested in their future, if only with money and Free School Meals Kid B whose parents don't give a damn and had a bad time at school and who needs school anyway? 

tl/dr
His experience of teaching and teachers solely comes from his education - the same with many of our critics and he has no understanding of what it means to be an educator in today's society.

Yes some colonies there were problems, one in which the UK has tried to be accountable for, but I wont buy into this ""we ruined africa"" blame attitude today, Africa was a savage land of war before any europeans came, It had problems with disease and small populations, European countries came on brought irrigation, industry, medicine.

The UKs empire is something that shaped the modern world, its main export was the industrial revolution and medicine which has saved many more people today. 

The main thing is that the UK has remained accountable for its actions, we still today finance many ex-colonies and try to help them rebuild, when there is a problem in these countries its the west that goes and helps. 

People may have attack the empire, but at the time it was acceptable, just like the Roman Empire 1800 before. Many say how the Roman Empire was great a brought in many techs, but it too did bad things.

I really think he is the quintessential Doctor, having all of the qualities that people love about other incarnations.

But we 'modernised' and 'civilised' them without their consent, and in the process destroyed the pre-existing polities and religions. Sub-Saharan Africa was home to a range of fairly complex societies such as the Zulu Kingdom, the Aro Confederacy and the Kingdom of Benin. To simply describe the whole of S-S Africa as 'savage' is to fall into the colonial mindset. Of course there were positives to the colonisation of Africa, but the flaws in the ideologies which drove this process must be recognised.

I'm as guilty as anyone in this. When /r/Scotland was taken over by cybernats I unsubscribed because it was full of things I did not agree with. When /pol/ UKIP raided /r/ukpolitics I considered unsubscribing.

See, the sun is owned by News UK which is owned by Rupert Murdoch and, to a lesser extent, his son James. Rupert Murdoch is a man who has been known to add his own politics to his pages, not unlike the Rothmeres, who own the Mail.

Now here's where it gets interesting. The red-tops have been against immigration for years. Maybe even decades. At no point has the deluge of ""this many people are coming here please panic"" stories ever ceased for more than a few weeks. 

This might lead some to presuppose that Murdoch's papers would praise rather than condemn UKIP and Farage. Except it isn't a presupposition, because Murdoch has openly praised Farage on twitter and the story of Murdoch's interest circulated in March.

There's no way a Murdoch-owned paper would be THIS brutal to one of its' political champions. Not unless that champion got into power, anyway. 

So...what happened, I wonder?

&gt; As the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, will know, we have in Northern Ireland what we have referred to over the years as ""whataboutery"". When one talks about the atrocities of the IRA, someone from the other side will say, ""Ah, but what about?"" I have lived with that for 30 years in Northern Ireland. There is a lot of ""whataboutery"".

- Gerry Fitt, House of Lords, 1998

&gt; As Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson writes, ""War in Libya is justifiable only if we are going to hold compliant dictators to the same standard we set for defiant ones."" This line of argument has surfaced in nearly every debate about Western military intervention since the end of the Cold War. The British even have a term for it: whataboutery. If you are prepared to go to war to protect Libyan civilians from their government, then what about the persecuted in Bahrain?

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; So the electorate was ill-informed and the question was biased to get a particular result?

This is [the pamphlet](http://www.harvard-digital.co.uk/euro/pamphlet.htm) the government sent out.

Here's the important bits:

First of all everything in the pamphlet talks about a market. It is mentioned 50 times in the document. Law is mentioned twice and legislature isn't mentioned at all.

Here's what I consider two important parts which are now no longer true.

&gt; Fact No. 2. No important new policy can be decided in Brussels or anywhere else without the consent of a British Minister answerable to a British Government and British Parliament.

As we know this is not the case.


&gt; The Minister representing Britain can veto any proposal for a new law or a new tax if he considers it to be against British interests.

Again as we know this is not the case.

So now you have seen how the pamphlet sent out to every household by the government was worded making heavy use of the word market, here's the referendum question they were given to answer:

""Do you think the UK should stay in the European Community (Common Market)?""

What do you think the result would have been without that leaflet and without (Common Market) in the question especially given that most of the electorate thought we were in a ""common market"", a trading body?

The N-word has a history of hate and discrimination inextricably linked to it, and as such its use can be extremely negative and hurtful to people. The only way I could get on board with defending it's use would be if it's loss would be equally hurtful/negative to the user of the word as it is to the person affected by its use.

If I missinterpreted your stance and my point that there **is no situation where the loss of the word would be as negative as the hurt the word causes** was not relevant I retract the point and ask you to explain your stance further.


I have not seen the film Lenny or the work of Lenny Bruce, but I take from your response that he probably used the N-word in order to shock his audience into laughter and built his act around that.

Since I'm Uruguayan you best believe my dad taught me all the history and the importance of our national team.  As a kid I never had a club team in America so I would just love to watch national games. My favorite team was obviously Uruguay. Fast forward to Luis Suarez at Ajax. I had heard this young guy was tearing dutch league a new asshole. I watched club soccer a lot but really was just for entertainment and had no favorite team or anything. So when Suarez moved to Liverpool, I began watching their games mainly to see Suarez play. I would also do the same for Cavani (Napoli) and Forlan (Atletico). Sometimes when he wasn't playing I didn't bother watching Liverpool. But slowly i began watching games without him and I just became more and more eager to watch liverpool play rather than just Suarez. I found myself cheering, reading articles, etc about Liverpool. I started truly understanding the importance of the team and it's rich history. I fell in love with them. I knew I officially became a fan when Suarez was asking to leave last summer. I told myself ""holy shit, if Suarez leaves, I will still be a Liverpool fan."" When he was suspended in for 10 games, I still watched those games and cheered for Sturridge like Suarez had never existed. For the first time it didn't matter whether an Uruguayan national was on the team, I would be a fan. It happened over time and this last season was truly fun. I watched every single game this season (thanks nbc) and I will continue doing so for as long as I live. As a soccer fan with no allegiance, it was great that Suarez helped me find the best club in the world to support. YNWA.

Let's be realistic here; he scored 11 goals in 36 appearances for us this year; nearly 1 in 3. This while adjusting to a new league, in a new country with a new language, 2 new coaches, including one who didn't speak any Spanish (Tim) and barely played him the last few months of the season. 

And we're talking about him as a ""flop"" after a season in which he scored 11 goals in 36 apps. In 2012-2013, Defoe scored 16 in 43; just 8 in 28 in 2010-2011.

Then in further comments it transpired you were talking about **bonuses** and not pensions. There's a very big difference between bonuses and pensions. The Lloyds group pensions have **not** lost the ""majority"" of their value, Lloyds shares have! There's a very big difference. A Lloyds employee of 25 years can still expect today to get the pension they have *earned* over their employment! Their pensions were **not** lost when the Lloyds share price crashed: I have asked you for a citation and you can't provide one, and I can't find one anywhere on the internet, all I can find is some info on a pension freeze that happened recently that will have a minimal impact on some employees, which is a Lloyds issue and not a pension issue.

The only way someone could have lost their entire retirement savings from the Lloyds share price crash is if they **did not** contribute to their pensions at all and instead focused 100% of their savings on Lloyds shares: that behaviour is exceptionally negligent and I find it very unlikely that thousands of people (as you claim) did this. Again I can't find any information on this online, there's no indication it's a widespread problem.

The Robert Maxwell pension theft was a quarter of a century ago, that sort of thing is impossible nowadays and **is not** something anyone nowadays needs to even consider, pensions have *a lot* of protections.

I'm sorry if my post came across as unfair however your comment was telling someone that pensions aren't safe and that you know thousands of people that have lost everything because they decided to use a pension for their retirement savings: that's a very dangerous thing to say because someone might now decide ""oh this guy said people lose everything with pensions, I shouldn't use a pension"" and if they do that they could be seriously harming their long term retirement prospects.
