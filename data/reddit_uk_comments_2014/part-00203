Chelsea made smart buys, they are defensive team and upgraded their keeper and defense, they should be more solid in the back than last year. They still have too many players who are athletic but not creative enough, Willian/Oscar/Ramires don't strike fear in any defense. Fabregas and Matic will be huge upgrade over last summers squad, but again they are City are the target it doesn't change if there is one or two of them, if we better one of them we better the other.


As for top 4 we just have to compete with 3 clubs for 2 positions (still don't think Spurs and Everton can take us on based on new system+new manager vs settled system). Hopefully we will still go for the win, but even if we can't take on 2 top clubs we will still have enough quality to take on the last 2 clubs.

My main point is that we can go in for Reus, Rodriguez, Koke, Felipe Luis, Hummels and Varane, and we far more likely than not won't sign one of them.

The rest.. maybe... out of that list only Baines, Azpilcueta,  Kolarov, Gibbs, Shaw, Clichy and Santon are better so I guess Ben Davies is in the top 8 based on last season..pretty good for someone who just turned 21. Stats wise he was one of the best in the Prem.


Baines was 6m,
Azpilicueta was 7m,
Kolarov was 19m,
Shaw was 30m,
Clichy was 8m... 

Now going by the fact that transfer fees have pretty much gone up by about 25% in the last 2 seasons I think £10m for Ben Davies is very solid, he's only 21 and has a lot of potential, he could easily be here for 10-12 years. United spent £30m on Shaw ffs. There's no one in the Prem who's as good that we can get for £10m.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Do you really drink that much tea or is this a joke like dropbears?

Hard to know how to answer this.  On the one hand, Brits (and pretend Brits, I suspect) on reddit undoubtedly play up the tea thing theatrically, a bit like dropbears.  On the other hand, there are totally some people who ""chain-drink"" tea all day, react to every event with ""better put the kettle on"", etc, without even noticing or thinking anything of it.

Other than that I don't really know where to begin answering your questions.  Partly because of what other people said, about how you can't distill a megadiverse place like London to a single popculture zeitgeist, and even if you could it's a different world to the rest of the uk in many ways.  Hell it's not even that relevant how big London is, you can't distill the smallest uk town to one pop culture because these things are always massively varied by age, class etc...

 Also to be perfectly honest I can't really answer because I have reached an age where I am massively ignorant about pop culture and am grumpily proud of it :P

I guess it's not reported because it's incredibly complicated, quite dull and not easy to produce headlines. People prefer to blame other people/politicians/immigrants because that means the problem can be fixed and that a golden future is just round the corner. Rather than look to physical limits and admit that nothing much can be done other than consume less and wait for inevitable crash. 

I'm worried who we're going to blame and what drastic action we're going to take when  the energy crunch starts to bite and living standards take a nose-dive. It's not likely to be pretty. 

Then again, I'm not all pessimism, the world has never been more peaceful than it is now. Maybe that trend will continue? Also, computing power and technological development has a habit of throwing curveballs. Maybe when things start to bite, there will be a Manhattan style project to crack novel nuclear technologies.

true,silentdragoon,blue,gamer,"Hey, I was a Computer Science student at Bristol from '07 to '11, and I'd be happy to give some advice :)

Halls are probably your best bet for first year, so you can meet a lot of other new students and make friends. 

The Stoke Bishop halls (Wills, Churchill, Durdham, Hiatt Baker, etc etc) are quite far away from the city proper, but have the highest concentration of students. Expect maybe a 45 minute walk or so to get to your lectures. 

Most other halls are clustered around the centre of town and the university precinct. These feel much more a part of the city, but each house/hall generally has a smaller population.

I personally stayed in The Hawthornes, which was a bit oddly laid out but nice in other ways - self catered, big rooms and five minutes away from lectures (which is always good when you wake up at 9am and have a lecture starting just then...).

Outside of halls, I can recommend Clifton, Redland, harbourside and Clifton Village. Clifton is the most expensive but the closest, while Redland and harbourside are a little further away but cheaper and just about as nice. 

Montpelier is another option - a little further than Redland and next to a (relatively) high crime rate area. I lived there for two years and enjoyed the artsy vibe, but a stolen car was dumped on our driveway and our neighbor was robbed... so your mileage may vary.  Also, there was an axe attack that year. Outside of this though it's quite a pleasant place, definitely gets you more in contact with the locals and flats are much cheaper. Going even further afield (probably will need a car at this stage), I've heard Fishponds is fairly pleasant and quiet cheap.

Anyway, good luck and let us know how you get on. Bristol is an awesome place and I'm still living there three years after graduation :) If you like, give me a shout when you're in town and I'll do a wee tour for ya.",0,1405528812,null,0,false,0,ciz47u4,t3_2av99i,t1_ciz47u4,t3_2av99i,null,1434744933,5,false,bristol,t5_2r52c,5

Start at a local level, as its success becomes wider the bankers loose progressively more and more control and there is nothing they can really do about it. Obviously the big fix is to do it at the national level but thats not going to happen because guess who is actually running things? the very people benefiting from this system. So you do it at a local level where you can have some degree of success. 

""If the Nation can issue a dollar bond it can issue a dollar bill.
The element that makes the bond good makes the bill good also. The
difference between the bond and the bill is that the bond lets the
money broker collect twice the amount of the bond and an additional 20%. Whereas the currency, the honest sort provided by the Constitution pays nobody but those who contribute in some useful way. It is absurd to say our Country can issue bonds and cannot issue currency. Both are promises to pay, but one fattens the usurer and the other helps the People."" -Thomas Edison-

""The power to determine the quantity of money... is too important, too pervasive, to be exercised by a few people, however public-spirited, if there is any feasible alternative. There is no need for such arbitrary power... Any system which gives so much power and so much discretion to a few men, [so] that mistakes - excusable or not - can have such far reaching effects, is a bad system.

&gt;The __[National Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League) [regular season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season_(sport\))__ begins the weekend after [Labor Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Day_(United_States\)) and ends in December or early January. It consists of 256 games, where each team plays 16 games during a 17-week period. Traditionally, the majority of each week's games are played on Sunday afternoon, with weekly games on Sunday night and Monday night, and occasional games on Thursday night or Saturday. Matchups are determined according to a scheduling formula. The current scheduling formula, in use since 2002, ensures that all teams play each other on a rotating basis.

farewell letter luis filipe,
dear fans atletico madrid

Today ends a stage in my life, the most important and happy that I have lived so far. It is the day that I leave the amadrid, the club thanks to which I've become the player and person I am at this moment, at how strong apostolate for my For four years and I've lived moments Not gonna ever forget.
The way to reach this point and it has not been easy, but it is a well-considered decision with which I do understand what's best for the club I've been in the Corozon and me and my family. It is time to face new challenges and therefore our paths diverge today, although serguro that will return in the future to meet

On the flip side, Coutinho has been amazing. This could well be his breakout year. Interesting to see who plays centrally when Lallana is also in the team. It's obvious Coutinho plays better in the middle, but then apparently that's also Lallana's best position. Would be good to see them interchange so as not to hamper Coutinho's development.

That's something that someone with a high opinion of himself says. Heck, even Zlatan (who has one of the biggest egos on Earth) admits that he can improve aspects of his game like headers. 

That's not a problem, it doesn't bother me that he chose to respond to being 5th choice by going out on loan. But should we not be able to discuss both parties' points of view? The club wanted time to bed him in, and he wanted to play. Regardless of who you think was in the right, ignoring either perspective will give you an incomplete understanding of the situation.

Completely agreed on Kaboul. He's good when he plays, but that isn't very often. If we get another power-CB who's ready to start, I'd throw him in for Vlad (who can then be Jan's backup).

First, most agents won't consider you unless you view in person. Second, I'd be dubious about those that do. Third, quality is *highly* variable so you really need to look. 

Word of warning though, there is always a huge flat hunt going on with the new university year as floods of students look for flats. People find out the places that get the ESPC out earliest, get on the first viewings and are ready to put down deposit there and then. Unfortunately, much before that is the festivals when vast numbers of tourists and performers flood in and accommodation goes (most already gone) at a massive premium. In general flat hunting can take a bit of time in Edinburgh due to the variable quality and plethora of ""landlords"" who have no clue what they are doing. 

Landlords don't like pets because they scratch and pee. Generally I didn't think this was a huge problem though, might be something to do with your timing as it is pretty much a sellers market this time of year. You might have better luck when trying private landlords e.g. gumtree.com or if the flat is ""non-HMO"" (which means the residents can't come from more than 2 families).

true,boss_electro,null,null,"I had a not so good experience with legal aid. My old landlord took me to court because I withheld rent. I did it because the contract was dodgy as it was, he rented out the living room as a bedroom (my room) and before I moved in, even had the audacity to make me pay £40 more for him to not rent the other half of it out as a separate bedroom (there were no dividing walls). There were also two rented bedrooms upstairs so to get to the kitchen, they had to walk through my room (the living room). I didn't mind because I knew what I was signing up for, but eventually he just got really weird. He kept inviting me to gay bars (I am gay but have no interest in partying with my lecherous old landlord). He would cut off our Internet to get our attention (if I ignored a phone call or text). He would invite himself over at any time, I once came home and found him sitting on my bed for no fucking reason, other than to ask me if he could sleep on the kitchen floor all the next week...

When I'd had enough of his creepiness I called the council and they sent him a strongly worded letter saying to basically leave me alone. He didn't, so I put a padlock on the gate to the property so he couldn't get in. He came over one day when I was out and used a boltcutter to remove it. The next time I found him in the house, I lost my temper and called the police, who told me there wasn't much they could do and I would just have to ask him to leave. He did so, but took the patio door key with him leaving it unlocked (so anybody could have come in, most likely him). By this point, with the council not helping, nor the police, I decided to withhold my rent until he a) reconnected the Internet I needed for my university work and b) left me alone. 

Not long later I had a huge was of court documents posted to me with pictures of all my belongings in. Im not a messy guy but as there was no storage, most of my stuff was in various bundles around the room. He took pictures of all my shit when I wasn't in and uses that, along with me not paying my rent to try and get me evicted. I had to use legal aid and I got some old lady who couldn't care less about the nuances of this case and insisted I just pay him the rent and leave. Leaving wasnt preferable, I would have liked to stay and just be left alone. When the court date rolled round, I was ushered into a room with a judge or whatever, him, his lawyer and my representative all sat together talking in hushed voices while I sat on my own. I didn't get one chance to speak or explain why I had withheld my rent. Our two lawyers then came to an 'agreement' that I leave and pay my rent by the end of the month. I left, but two years later I still haven't paid my rent. My credit rating is shit which is not a great way to start adult life, but fuck listening to logic lets just ruin shit for this young adult because there's nothing wrong with being a creepy pervert who invades your privacy and holds your Internet hostage if you snub his offers to go gay clubbing with him.

Coutinho: looked good, as usual. 

Peterson: honestly wasn't really on my radar much before this, but he looked pretty good as well for 19. Clearly needs a bit more development but he could be something special in a few years if things go right.

[BBC - 38 police officers leave while facing conduct inquiries](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-27943874)

&gt; Police officers who resign or retire while under investigation cannot be subject to any disciplinary action - although criminal proceedings may still be brought against them.

&gt; If they leave they still get a pension, and an officer cannot be interviewed about the case under investigation.

&gt; The IPCC said the practice hampered investigations and damaged public confidence in policing.

&gt; **Chief Constable Jacqui Cheer, National policing lead for professional standards:**

&gt; ""Where officers resign during the course of gross misconduct proceedings, they often do so as a result of the strength of the evidence against them and an acceptance that dismissal is inevitable.""
 
&gt; **""By resigning at this early stage, the expense to the service and taxpayers of carrying out an extended investigation is saved”**

&gt; The Home Office said it was committed to changing the law to ensure officers who did leave in such circumstances still faced sanctions.

&gt; Chief Inspector Mick Williams has also been barred from working again for the police after being put on the College of Policing’s disapproved register.

&gt; Today, the force said Ch Insp Williams has now resigned - bringing an end to the disciplinary process.

&gt; A Cleveland Police spokeswoman said: “After careful and detailed consideration, Cleveland Police has decided to accept the officer’s resignation, firmly believing that this is the right outcome when taking all available information in to account.

&gt; **“His timely exit from the organisation prevents further, unnecessary strain on the public purse**

Dear xxxxx


Thanks for getting in touch on the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Bill.  I share your concern and have listened carefully to the large number of representations I have received on the way the government has brought this forward, rushing it through the House of Commons with very little notice or time for public debate.  I therefore voted, contrary to a 3-line whip, against the Business Motion which made this timetable possible.  Unfortunately, the motion was carried by 436 votes to 49.


On the substance of the Bill, there is a real problem, in that given the vulnerability of existing regulations following the April European court judgement on the relevant European directive, without this legislation the police will lose vital information used in 95% of serious &amp; organised crime investigations, as well as counter-terror investigations and online child abuse.   People rightly expect government and parliament not to put such protection at risk.  For me, this underlines how ill-judged it was of the government to rush this through, rather than bringing forward measures earlier, with more notice, so there could have been more informed public debate. 


On the more positive side, Labour have been able to improve the Bill in some key respects:


Legislating for the Interception of Communications Commissioner to report on the working of this new Act within six months of commencement and in six-monthly intervals thereafter.


Making the independent review of RIPA (Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act) secured by Labour statutory and underpinned by the law through this legislation.


I understand it was also Labour pressure which ensured that this emergency legislation will be temporary - it will expire in 2016.  Our securing agreement to a major independent review of the legal framework governing surveillance (as we called for four months ago) means that there can be a proper public and Parliamentary debate over what the longer term legislation and arrangements should be. The Government has also agreed to a new Privacy and Civil Liberties Board.


The sunset clause is important in this Bill, but the process of fundamental reform Labour secured through the independent review of the entire legal framework -- including the powers, regulation, proportionality and oversight for data retention, access and interception to be reviewed -- will result in wide-ranging reform. That isn't possible in 5 months -- which would result in another rushed piece of legislation before the powers the police need expire; but the six-monthly reviews which have been secured should bring the whole area under closer scrutiny.


In summary, the government have rushed this through in an appalling way, but the Commons has ensured the current capability and basic powers needed remain, while the process of much-needed reform begins.  I will keep a close eye on how this progresses, as well as on the exercise of the present powers.


With best wishes

Rt Hon Andrew Smith MP (Oxford East)


**email I sent:**

Dear Andrew Smith,

I urge you to oppose the new legislation on emergency phone and data
laws (Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014).

 As I'm sure you're aware this is being rushed through in only a week
in response to the European Court of Justice striking down a similar
directive in
April.(http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2014-04/cp140054en.pdf)
with the response:

""The Court takes the view that, by requiring the retention of those
data and by allowing the competent national authorities to access those
data, the directive interferes in a particularly serious manner with
the fundamental rights to respect for private life and to the
protection of personal data.""

The new laws being voted on are far from transparent and there is no
oversight in place to ensure that only those involved in or planning
serious harm against others are having data about them retained.
Furthermore I have doubts as to whether this wide reaching, untargeted
data retention of the whole population is proportional to the level of
threat faced by those who wish to commit acts of terror and other
crimes for which this data will be used. This also brings up
interesting problems with the security of this gathered personal data
which is not dealt with in the bill.

Other than purely concerns over the nature of the bill I also have
concerns over the speed at which it is being introduced.

The ECJ ruling was in April, however this bill is being rushed through
parliament in July in the course of one week. I respect the democratic
process and expect MPs to have the time required to scrutinize
legislation and gather opinions from constituents such as myself. The
speed at which this is being introduced doesn't allow the legislation
to go under proper process and full debate, circumventing not only the
voting populace but also those who have been voted in to represent us.

I would very much like to hear your response if you disagree with the
points made above and I implore you and your colleagues to vote against
this legislation until it can undergo the due political process and
scrutiny such an attack on our privacy deserves.

Yours sincerely,

My point about them looking the same is more related to the fact that men's fashion is far more restrictive. Most male frontbenchers and politicians are white, of an average size with fairly short tidy dark or grey hair. Their clothes in particular are very homogenous. The standard outfit for a minister is black, grey or navy suit, a white shirt and a tie that's normally the party colour, maybe with a subtle pattern. Even compared to people in other jobs male politicians dress in a particularly conservative way. I don't think either gender of politician should be judged by how they dress, but you couldn't make an interesting story out of the fashion choices of male ministers if you wanted to.",0,1405534638,null,0,false,0,ciz7fcm,t3_2auqex,t1_ciz7fcm,t1_ciz5dtp,null,1434746638,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

We were playing a team that are much further along their pre season than us and are therefore much fitter and sharper. Add in the fact that we almost completely switched the team at half time and it's pretty easy to see why we struggled a bit. This first game was about improving match fitness, which I'm sure every player achieved.

In terms of actual performances it is hard to pick out many stand outs. Coutinho was clearly on another level to anyone else on the pitch. Ibe looked good for spells but should have scored. He's like a young Sterling at the moment. Peterson looked fairly decent as well and it was good to see him get on the score sheet. Was a little disappointed with Suso, thought he would've offered a lot more. Also a shame we didn't get to see much of Ilori, I think this could be a good season for him. 

Saunders is a god awful pundit, hopefully won't have to listen to much more of him. I've got no idea why he kept blaming Stewart for the goal, he couldn't have done a lot more.

At this point, I think Mourinho needs to really focus on which young players deserve to stay with the team for the season, which ones should be sold, and which ones need another year on loan.

Also, I'd like to add that I personally think Lukaku needs to get a serious shot this season.

true,Perihelion_,null,null,"Agreed on Collins. He was bought in a panic when we had very few first team players and somehow survived the boot for ages. The fact that to this day he still gets a run out is incredibly frustrating as it feels to me like we'd be better served with only ten men, rather than with him on the pitch and our defence assuming he'll be in the right position when he almost always is not.

As for Halford, I don't know if I agree with you. He's almost the perfect matchday substitute. It's really, really useful to have someone that can play near enough anywhere sat on the bench - assuming he's happy there knowing he's the silly putty player whose primary job is to plug any leaks in the boat. He can play right back to a reasonable standard too and with our first choice fullbacks looking to miss the start of the season he'll be handy to get us over the hump.

I'm getting pleased with the depth we have too though. Mancienne is a centre back but apparently is handy as a defensive midfielder too, so we've got the cover in midfield that I recall worrying about only the other day in a post here, and apparently Veldwijk has linked up well with our midfield and even Cox in the warmup/friendly game against Ilkeston. It might only be Ilkeston but the fact that they're all starting to click together is promising.

It's perfectly feasible that you are ignorantly obfuscate in your argumentation - ignoring pertinent arguments of others and repositioning the debate into *argumentum ad hominem* owing to poor argumentation tactics - yet at the same time, it is perfectly feasible that you are *deliberately* obfuscate (i.e., manipulative).

What's also a bad thing is if the best men or women for the job systematically never even get considered because of wider societal issues. That's the point of positive discrimination - to select maybe not quite the best candidates today in the hope of helping to address larger trends so as to get *all* the best candidates at some later point.

You can disagree that this is a good idea, or an effective way to reach that goal, but you do have to engage with the actual points of the exercise. It's not really an argument to simply say you want the best person for the job because it's beside the point - that's what positive discrimination is (in principle) there for, and people who support it do so because they want the same thing you do.

This is a general comment about positive discrimination, and how it's more complicated than your trivialisation of the effects.

Even commercially available hobby drones these days have GPS flight path control. You can bet with confidence that this thing is packed with sophisticated avionics allowing for total autonomy if needs be.
Drones like this will take off, fly to their objective bomb it and land again without a human needing to go near the controls.
It can fly a high altitude patrol undetected for hours on end, higher &amp; longer than any human pilot can endure, notifying a control centre / operator of any enemy contact.
if something unexpected happens and/or it loses contact with HQ, it will simply fly itself home and land.

You can't see in these pictures but the Taranis is larger than you'd think- about the size of the Hawk (the plane the red arrows fly) and is designed to be stealthy. [Mantis is bigger still](http://defense-update.com/images_large3/mantis_auvsi.jpg).

Furthermore, it is misleading to call it the 'new combat drone' since it is in no way being mass produced on any scale and will likely never see combat in its current form. It's more of a demonstrator / proof of concept to drum up some business and wheel around the air shows.

true,mad_disciple,null,null,"First half player review:

GK: Schwarzer - not a lot to do, one dropped corner led to the only real chance for Wycombe.

DF: Injury to Kane was frustrating and didn't allow him to play the half, also looks like it'll be a short recovery after as well. Chalobah and Christensen looked very composed in the centre but weren't really tested. Ake showed good pace to get up the left wing supplying a good cross for the goal but one moment where he let the ball bounce and lost possession near the corner flags highlights that LB is not his natural position.

MF: Centre was controlled without real penetration, Van Ginkel looked very good on the ball, Romeu was quiet but kept possession well and Baker wasn't involved as much as he should have been, especially in attacking areas.

Wings: Piazon - not really involved much and one dragged shot wide, did ok. Swift - showed his work ethic tracking on the wing and winning the ball back, also drifted inside for a nice 1-2 through the middle but again not enough attacking instinct from the team to get him involved.

ST: Bamford - player of the half, scored with a beautifully deft finish on a low volley. Has a real instinct in front of goal, also cleared off the line from the error by Schwarzer on the corner for Wycombe.

Overall a safe half just developing control of the opposition, never really troubled especially from open play.

I think you've misinterpreted my point. You've cast some dude refusing to sell alcohol as an unusual event. Think to yourself, if it was you at a Tesco with a bottle and you're about to go home and this happened, some guy said ""can't touch that, I'm Muslim"" wouldn't you simply step to another till and walk out shaking your head at the stupidity of it or would you call the press? My argument is you only think it's unusual due to the low number of times it's been reported. I'm saying the low number of times it's been reported are due to it being a story most of us would believe was not worth our time.

My sister was recently denied a flat by an agent in East London because the landlord told him not to rent it out to black people, particularly Africans. My sister didn't go to the press because it's simply not what most people would do. This story *has* been reported before, by the BBC and they only got the footage they got because it was so widespread and had happened *thousands* of times before they investigated it. It wasn't unusual.

&gt;I can't recall ever being denied service in the UK on religious grounds.

Neither can I, yet here we are reading a story about it. There are lots of things I haven't experienced myself, but I'm not myopic enough to believe therefore it's a rare occurrence. But I have personally experienced lots of racism and discrimination...never been in the papers even once.

Dear Mr [redacted],

Thank you for your e-mail received regarding the above subject, the content of which I have relayed to Mr Campbell and noted for office reference.

I am replying on behalf of Mr Campbell.

Mr Campbell will be opposing the Bill; he has put his name to an amendment on the Sunset Clause to the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Bill as he has concerns in the way it is being rushed through parliament.

The aim is to focus in opposing the Bill today around the amendment supported by Liberty, English PEN, Article 19, Privacy International and others bringing the sunset clause forward to 6 months, expiring on the 31st of December to 2014.

The amendment is aimed at reflecting the supposed temporary nature of the Bill, to provide the opportunity to debate the appalling lack of democratic accountability during the process and to ensure a prompt review of the proposed extensions to the RIPA interception regime.

I trust this reply clarifies Mr Campbell’s position.

If I can be of any further assistance, then please do not hesitate to contact the office.
 
Yours sincerely
 
Carol Porteous

true,physics4life,null,null,"If you want to save it, you will likely have so little (sorry!) that it doesn't really matter too much about the interest rate of where you put it - at best you'd be talking a few tens of pounds per year.

Personally I'd get a current account and an instant access savings account. If you want get an ISA, but you don't earn enough to benefit from the tax advantages of them. (Interest on ISAs is tax free, but you don't pay tax anyway, and even if you did, the interest you'll earn will be very low).

Talk to the bank about what happens if you accidentally overdraw. If you can, see if they'll let you have a £50 overdraft so that if you accidentally have £0 in your bank when your phone contract comes out you won't have to pay a fee.

Savings wise, I'd start by putting say, £20-50 per week into the savings account. at £20 you'll save about £1000 a year. At £50 you'll save £2,400 a year.

As it's instant access, if you need the cash, you can just get it back. Interest rates don't matter much - right now they are all crap.

If you start feeling a bit good about all this, you may consider getting a credit card to build your credit rating (so if you want car finance or something you'll get a better deal in the future).

If you get a credit card, make sure you pay it off. It will cost you significantly otherwise. If you buy anything big (e.g. a new laptop, a holiday), buying it on a credit card gives you some additional protection and insurance on it.

Make sure you pay the card off every month, otherwise you will have serious problems.

As you aren't planning to borrow money on the card, the APR doesn't really matter. Nor do points (e.g. Tesco clubcard points) as you aren't spending enough to really matter.


If you do all that, you could end up in two years with £2-3k saved up and a decent credit rating, ready to start your career with some financial security.",0,1405540849,null,0,false,0,cizawt3,t3_2avmz7,t1_cizawt3,t3_2avmz7,null,1434748552,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3

true,Kesuke,null,null,"You absolutely right... to an extent... but something about your post makes me think you either don't rent, or don't rent in the conditions in which most people find problematic...

* Renting is fine when you are a 19 year old student. Get an eviction notice? Meh, bit of a bummer... Now what if you are 32, fairly newly married with a 2 year old child and a 5 year old child. Your wife doesn't work because childcare costs more per month than her salary would earn, and your 5 year old has just started school... a school which was dependent on you being resident within the schools catchment area. These are the conditions most young parents find themselves in.

* Now, if you get served an eviction order for trying to force your landlord to clean up the mould that threatens your asthmatic children's health you are so fucked it's unreal... at best your kids are moving school, leaving friends behind and suffering all the long term mental consequences of that. At worst, you're on the street at short notice with 2 small children and an unemployed wife. It's thoughts like this that make me shudder at the thought of having kids before owning property. Property ownership isn't just some middle class asset-pride, it's largely about having the security to dictate your own future. Being part of a mobile workforce is fine when you're a beer guzzling student - but as you grow up you realize you need security and predictability, especially for children.

* As it currently stands, anyone can be a landlord. People who have been declared bankrupt, even convicted sex offenders... and that needs to change, like yesterday. It's going to be suck a hot topic either at the next election or perhaps more likely the one after.

----------

Politicians at the moment have realized rental tenants are a political group... but they think renters a political demographic in the same way ""mumsnet users"" or ""single parents"" are. What they don't realise, is that at the 2020 general election it isn't going to be about NHS reform or the Education system like it has been for the last 10 years. It isn't going to be about tax cuts or immigration... no, it's going to be about the rental sector. Why? Because in 6 years time at the 2020 general election the guys in threads like this who are 25-35 and want kids/security are going to be 30-40 and with the current trajectory of the economy failing to translate into property ownership people are going to be demanding reform of the rental sector. Seriously, it'll be like the poll tax... and whichever party embraces it first is going to absolutely dominate that election. Whenever you get a large age-centric demographic all voting in one way that is going to produce landslide elections.

true,robert001,null,null,"When you buy a house, you can pay for it with all your savings and its yours, or you can take out something called a 'mortgage'. This is just a loan but with a longer word as its for a house.

When you need some money but don't have much of your own you can ask a bank to give you some. They will give it to you but you have to pay it back in little amounts each month.  To make it worth lending you some money, they'll ask for a little bit on top each month. This is called 'interest'. 

The interest rate is set by the Bank of England, who are like the bank's bank, they are overall responsible for the main interest rate of the country. This is the rate that the banks borrow money from each other for.  Now, they want to make a bit more money on top to pay for their interest but also all their other costs and the profit.  So the interest rate you pay on a mortgage is a little more than the 'base rate' (thats the one the Bank of England set).  It goes up and down depending on lots and lots of things that are going on.

Now, when you want a mortgage you can get several types.

1) Fixed - this means that for a set amount of time (say 5 years) the interest you pay on your mortgage each month is the same. This might be 4% for example.  Its good because you know what you'll have to pay, and if the interest rate goes up, you'll be winning, but if the interest rate goes down you could be paying more than people on

2)...Tracker - these are interest rates that change depending on the interest rate that the bank has at the time.  Can be good, can be bad. 

There are others such as offset. But these 2 are primarily used. 

Now, I said earlier that if you don't have enough money to buy a house the bank can lend you some.  Normally they won't lend you the whole value of a house, they'll want a deposit from you. This is usually something like 10-20% of the value of the house you'll have to pay from your own savings. It is security for the bank as otherwise you could just stop paying your mortgage back and all that happens is they take the house off you. By having a deposit you have something to lose if you stop paying.  The bigger the deposit you are able to pay at the beginning, the lower your interest rate is likely to be, as a) there's less to pay off, and b) you've proved you're a less risky person to deal with to the bank. If you can pay 40% of the value of the house at the beginning as a deposit, you are going to get a really, really good rate as the bank knows you've got lots to lose by not paying back their money. 

Now, another thing to know is that a lot of people do a thing called an 'interest only' mortgage, where for the first few years (a normal mortgage will have a repayment period of something like 25 years) they are only paying back the interest and hardly any of the actual house value.  Once the 25 years worth of interest is paid off, then the value of the house is paid off.  The reason this isn't completely as stupid as it sounds is that most people think that the value of their house is going to rise (putting them in 'positive equity', where the house is worth more than they paid for it and therefore an asset for them) and so they could just sell, give the part the bank wants back, and keep the rest.  Some people get into a thing called 'negative equity' when house prices dip below what they originally paid for it, and this means they are giving more money to the bank than the house is worth.

So in conclusion, interest rates will effect how much you have to pay back to the bank each month.  The higher the interest rate, the more on top of your house repayment you have to make to the bank as their fee for lending you the money in the first place.

Nastasic is a young player, he's shown promise, but he's also shown he's found it difficult to adapt to a new style of play under Pellegrini. He's coming off the back of a poor season, plagued by poor form and a recurring knee injury.

When Mangala arrives he'll effectively be 4th place.

That is bad news from Nastasic's perspective, a young player like him needs regular playing time. He isn't going to get that at City this season, or in the foreseeable future.

A move could be a good thing for him, and for us, if it means we can add funds to a move for Barkley or Pogba.

Rekik would be content to be 4th behind our other central defenders, and we wouldn't be too much weaker for it - unless we got really unfortunate with injuries and ended up relying upon him regularly, albeit that's unlikely.

The thing I **do** care about though is having children at some point probably in the next 10 years... and the thought of doing that while renting literally keeps me awake some nights. How could I ever provide security and safety for my family in a place that;

* I could be turfed out of at just 4 weeks notice.

* That could develop major life-threatening problems like mould (very dangerous for a child with bronchiolitis or ashtma) that can take years to force a landlord to fix... which typically results in revenge-eviction before the problems are solved, and that is completely legal.

* Where a landlord, who could be a convicted sex offender, or have been declared bankrupt can legally gain access to my property ""in an emergency"" (hmmm... vague) or with 48 hours prior notice (as is typically written into contracts).

* Where the price can suddenly get jacked up to reflect changes in the local market, even forcing me out of a home and my children out of a school that is likely to be dependent on their living within its catchment area etc.

Property ownership isn't some selfish retirement dream for youngsters. It's a legitimate desire to be able to provide short-mid term security over their future. As you grow up you realise that especially where children are concerned you need to be able to provide stability, financial predictability and above all housing security... right now all three of those are made extremely difficult by the complexities of an exploitative rental market.

Ibe and Suarez are different players that can't be compared gets your point across without sounding like I'm abusing the guy.  
Sterlings problem wasn't finishing, it was running, dribbling, passing, doing anything productive. Ibe is getting past 5 players and then missing, that is the problem Suarez had, the one Coutinho currently has. It's trying too hard to get a goal and fucking it up after using all their energy on the build up. Suarez stopped his 4-5 players dribbles that ended with a shot while he was off balance, he decided he create small spaces and make 1-2 passes to get a clear shot on goal. Coutinho will probably have it much harder time than Ibe to get passed that stage (he is always far away from the goal unlike Ibe and Suarez who can stay around the box) which is why I chose Suarez.",0,1405545501,null,0,false,0,cizdg0i,t3_2avl3o,t1_cizdg0i,t1_ciz9ff2,null,1434750054,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

I was in Hiatt Baker, which is one of the largest catered halls, and I had a great time there. It's on the stoke bishop campus, which is further out of the centre but it's pretty nice. Avoid the more expensive unite halls. I would really recommend that you go take a look at them, or at least get the accommodation brochure and go to each hall's website and check them out, but really wherever you end up you'll meet lots of other students and have some crazy times.

I would also say that if you're quite outgoing, don't go for a hall with a flat structure as you can end up getting stuck with some dull people. Open floors have more of a mix.

I also like catered halls because if you run out of money you can still eat, and it saves you time in both shopping and cooking. 

I would advise against living in private accommodation or in one of the official student houses as you won't meet as many people and some can end up being a bit isolated.

As for advice for living in Bristol - my biggest piece advice is to fully explore the city. So many students do nothing but go to student nights and hang out in student bars, and really there is a lot more to Bristol than that. You can pursue pretty much any interest here. Also check out the fresher's fair - but don't start signing up for anything until you've looked around the whole place and seen what is on offer as there's a lot!

Because it's really, really hard to do that without harming legitimate industries.

Honestly it's like people saying *well we should have fusion reactors to power our homes, not coal, then we wouldn't have to worry about it*.

Do you stop companies charging for IP?  Do you put limits on costs of merchandise (say my coffee company paid £1 per cup to a HK entity).

The rules are outrageously complex as is and has gotten a lot harder over the last 15 years, so my accountant tells me anyway, I've really no idea, I know a tiny fraction of what is required to do the accounts for my software + services firm.  Fun thing is, I am of course on the hook for any mistakes in these things I don't understand.  If I took enough time to read and understand all the rules, all the exemptions, every way I could save a few pennies, my business would probably go bust!

&gt;I find it amusing that in this ""age of austerity"", one of the first things the coalition did was to cut the higher tax rate for the richest people in the country. Apparently there was money to do that.

Because it generated less money than expected.  There is a psychological point at which people will say fuck it, most people I know earning well over £150k hate their job with a passion, hence why they are being paid so much to do it.

My personal laffer curve fuck this moment was the 67% taxation I had on a chunk of money I took out of my company.  Whilst this was only on £18k or so, it was just too much.  I couldn't justify the sacrifices I was making, for doing that 'extra' work.  The difference in my pocket at the end of the day wasn't enough to make me do it.  So I didn't.  I've not over a year, earned half what I earned then, why bother, the cost to my life is far higher than the gain.

true,ricecows,lfc99,,"Rosenborg used to be a team often seen in CL a few years back, but they are norwegian so not really relevant to this question...

I'll try and explain why the danish Superliga is better than the swedish Allsvenskan.

**1.)** The danish league follows the pattern of the other european leagues (summer to summer) where as the norwegian and swedish leagues go winter to winter, while having a longer off-season. This often means that swedish and norwegian teams are out of form, when playing qualification for Europa League or CL. The danish league have a long break from november to march as well, which often means the teams are out of form when european football leaves the group stages. The league starts sooner though, which also means that Brøndby is hitting top form today, while Liverpool is only just getting started with pre-season.

**2.)** The danish league has fewer teams in the top tier division (12) compared to swedish Allsvenskan (16). This means fewer teams compete for the best players, so the best players aren't spread as thin.

**3.)** Icehockey is a huge sport in Sweden, and there's more money in the NHL compared to the swedish league or 2. Bundesliga etc. It's also easier to break through to a NHL team compared to a big european football club.

***3a.)*** In Denmark, handball is also pretty big, but the same goes for Sweden. Sweden has three major sports to spread their talent mass too, while Denmark only really has two... And handball doesn't really pay well in Denmark.

**4.)** While the danish tax is one of the highest in the world, there's a special tax called ""scientist tax"" that can give foreigners a reduced tax (26% brutto) for a period of up to five years. With a higher average salary than Sweden, the best swedish players can get lured to Denmark for the lucrative salary and tax. Danes who have lived abroad for a number of years can also get this benefit (which is one of the reasons why Thomas Kahlenberg plays for Brøndby again, and not a mid-table Bundesliga team, where the salary would be higher).

**5.)** Brøndby IF have had an amazing talent pool and talent coaches for years (pretty much produced the entire team that won the Euros in '92), and in the last 10 years FC København, FC Midtjylland and FC Nordsjælland have started to catch on.

***5a.)*** The danish youth system is heavily inspired by dutch and german football, putting focus on attacking play and promoting technical skills over physical attributes. Goals doesn't even get noted in the u10's leagues. Fun and technical skills is what matters (in the old days, the kids who developed physically the fastest usually got playing time, because games got won by physical force rather than technical skill).

**6.)** In Sweden (and Norway) they tend to play a ""kick and rush""-style of football, where we in Denmark usually play poessesion based football. This develops players technical attributes and the play overall. This also means danish football is more interesting, and more attractive (so more people go see the matches).

**7.)** The danish league was for a long time dominated by FCK and Brøndby IF, but in the past 3 years or so, FCM, FCN and AaB have started to get some amazing results (while Brøndby almost got relegated a couple of times.. It all went downhill after Michael Laudrup left after the 04/05 season). The swedish league is more open, so the best players doesn't all pile up at one or two teams. In Denmark the best players usually go to the top teams, which is why the top4 in Denmark is superior to the top4 in Sweden, but the rest of the teams might be equal to the other swedish teams.. The 2nd division in Sweden is also way better than the danish 2nd division.


I hope this was elaborate enough for you :-) I myself stopped following the danish Superliga a couple of years back, but still watch Brøndbys game when they are available on the telly, and go to the stadium when I can (I live in a different city now, so it's quite the travel).


**PS:** Not quite sure Sweden produces better footballers.. Jan Mølby, Allan Simonsen (Ballon d'Or 1977), Michael Laudrup, Brian Laudrup, Peter Schmeichel, Daniel Agger, Prebel Elkjær (won Seria A with Hellas Verona in 85, as the leagues best player) and lesser known Jon Dahl Tomasson (super substitute AC Milan, and filled in when Inzaghi got injured). Michael Krohn-Dehli and Thomas Kahlenberg have also recieved a lot of praise, while Daniel Wass is showing great promise with french side Evian... No need to mention B52 Nicklas Bendtner. Sweden have had Olaf Melberg, Henrik ""Henke"" Larsson, Johan Elmander and obviously Zlatan Ibrahimovich",0,1405549116,null,0,1405550376,0,cizfa5c,t3_2av6ch,t1_cizfa5c,t1_ciz7x6o,null,1434750790,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

It also assumes that we, the fans, have the patience to let it play out, and that we, Tottenham, can acquire enough talented kids to make it work. In the short term, having FdB turn us into the ""Ajax"" of England would mean dropping down the table and working our way back up. Lamela? Not willing to track back, gone. Dawson? Not good on the ball, gone. Sandro? Not a good enough dribbler or passer, gone. Having FdB turn us into the English Ajax would require *gutting* our current squad. All for a project that I'm not convinced would work.

Because a large part of Ajax's success is that they are **Ajax** in Holland. They get so many of the best youngsters from Belgium, Denmark, Holland, Sweden, etc. to develop into their players. I think it's pretty naive to believe that we could start pulling in a significantly better quantity of top young (under 16) talent simply because FdB is our coach, and I don't think the Ajax system will work without a *lot* of top young talent, something that we simply do not have right now. We have a lot of *good* young talent, but how many kids have come through our Academy into the first team recently? The Ajax system works by having *all* your first team have come through the system together, and that takes a *long* time to build. Do you have 10 years of patience for that to work? Would most fans?

I understand the allure of Frank de Boer and the ""Ajax way"" but I don't think it's a feasible model in England, certainly not for Spurs, and I'm not convinced that it will work at the top top levels in the modern era, since Ajax hasn't won a thing outside Holland since football free-agency became legal in the early 90s.",0,1405549884,null,0,false,0,cizfnbo,t3_2avgbo,t1_cizfnbo,t1_ciz9xnf,null,1434750972,9,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,9

Anyway, the best I can suggest is as follows:  

- Contact your university of choice and find out if you are eligible for any scholarships. Apply for them all. Plenty of unis offer things like extra money per year, money for supplies or amounts taken off your accommodation/fees for people on certain courses or with certain grades. For example, my uni offers a £1000p/a bursary or £1000 off the cost of their accommodation for students with AAB or higher upon entry who achieve 2:1 or higher each year of their degree. Plenty aren't based on parental income, so don't think you're not eligible just because you don't qualify for the maintenance grant.


- Find out if your uni has a hardship fund. This is a fund for students who are struggling to make ends meet if you need money for something like bills or food. It's useful to know how to apply for this money in the worst case scenario. 


- Try and get some work in a pub, bar or shop. It is fairly flexible work but will provide you with the money you need to get by week to week. As long as you're not doing a crazy subject like veterinary medicine or something, you should be able to manage a part time job alongside your studies. 


- If your chosen profession lends itself to it, try and work freelance over the year. Use your uni careers team to help you find this work. ",0,1405550163,null,0,false,0,cizfsb7,t3_2aw8jg,t1_cizfsb7,t3_2aw8jg,null,1434751041,8,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,8

Now he'll basically never lose the ball and will almost definitely beat a couple if players before he releases, but by the time that happens the opposition will have had time to recover their defensive shape and so we have to try to break through packed defenses all the time.

This line killed me. I assume you just mean further north than Birmingham, but in England the ideals of north v south is a pretty big culture divide.

Tips wise would help if we knew what you are into?

Birmingham, Nottingham, Peterborough are easy to get between on public transport. Getting to most other cities from them shouldn't be a problem either. Wales may pose more of a problem, especially if it is rural. If you are under 26 you might be able to get a railcard which would really cut down on train fares.

Do some searches in /r/unitedkingdom and /r/england as I am sure there are similar threads about people looking for advice on moving to the UK. We speak the same language, and once you learn which way to look when crossing the road you should be fine.

It's the Head of News' job at any media organisation to decide the running order of importance for every story of that day. That list is what he or she believes in his or her professional opinion to be relevant and of interest to as many people as possible. 

The fact is, despite the feeling in this subreddit, most people in the country really don't care and/or don't understand, so they don't want to hear about it. As soon as the news reporter starts saying ""this bill means that the government can now issue interception warrants for communications data to companies outside of the UK"" then peoples' eyes will glaze over and they won't listen. 

Secondly, this bill doesn't actually change much. All these sensationalist headlines about the government spying on your every online move and reading all your emails and blah blah blah is rubbish. It is far too biased saying anything like that on the BBC, Sky, etc. 

The truth is it's just another small step in the reduction of our privacy, but that's what the problem is. Each step is so small that individually they aren't worth reporting.

&gt;Regards
 
&gt;Fiona Parker
&gt;Constituency Secretary to the Rt Hon Peter Lilley MP

followed up two days later with:

&gt;Thank you for contacting Peter Lilley about The Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Bill.
 
&gt;The Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Bill was announced in the House of Commons on 10 July. The Bill ensures that capabilities to fight crime and protect the public are maintained. It clarifies existing law without extending current powers.
 
&gt;Communications data is the context not the content of a communication. It can be used to demonstrate who was communicating; when; from where; and with whom. It can include the time and duration of a communication, the number or email address of the originator and recipient, and sometimes the location of the device from which the communication was made. It does not include the content of any communication: for example the text of an email or a conversation on a telephone. Communications data is used by the intelligence and law enforcement agencies during investigations regarding national security and, organised and serious crime. It enables investigators to identify members of a criminal network, place them in specific locations at given times and in certain cases to understand the criminality in which they are engaged.
 
&gt;Interception provides, under strict conditions and for a limited number of public authorities, access to the content of a communication. This Bill will not alter the existing safeguards which regulate interception. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies will continue to require an interception warrant signed by the Secretary of State. The Bill also clarifies the economic well-being purpose for obtaining communications data or issuing an interception warrant under RIPA, and the definition of a “telecommunications service”. This is to ensure interception warrants can only be issued and communications data can only be obtained on the grounds of economic well-being when specifically related to national security. Clarifying the definition of “telecommunications service” ensures internet-based services, such as webmail, are included in the definition.
 
&gt;The Government considers it important to pass legislation quickly to make it unequivocal that the United Kingdom will continue to have a data retention regime and RIPA continues to have extra-territorial jurisdiction. This includes clarifying the definition of a “telecommunications service” to ensure internet-based services, such as webmail, are included.
 
&gt;The Bill passed all its stages in the Commons yesterday and is now in the House of Lords.
 
&gt;Yours sincerely 
 
&gt;Fiona Parker
 
&gt;Constituency Secretary to the Rt Hon Peter Lilley MP

true,[deleted],null,null,"Forbes is always spot on about the finances. You can get rid of whatever thoughts you have of them being ""biased"" or hating Chelsea because these guys look at football as a business and couldn't care less about fan rivalries and what not. 

The reason they didn't factor in the land value is because the land and the stadium isn't owned by the club.

Chelsea suffered serious financial troubles during the 1970s and 1980s following a large-scale attempt to renovate Stamford Bridge. The financial crisis and a subsequent change of ownership at the club culminated in the sale of the Stamford Bridge freehold to property developers Marler Estates (and subsequently Cabra Estates). The move almost saw Chelsea lose the stadium.

The future of the stadium (and hence the club) was only secured in 1992, when the property developers were bankrupted by a market crash, allowing the then-chairman Ken Bates to do a deal with their bankers and to regain control of the stadium for the football club. Following this, Chelsea Pitch Owners was created, and in 1997 it purchased the Stamford Bridge freehold, the turnstiles, the pitch and the Chelsea FC name with the aid of a non-recourse loan of £10 million from Chelsea Village plc, the parent company of the club. The CPO in turn granted the club a 199 year lease on Stamford Bridge at a peppercorn rent.

In granting control of the freehold to Chelsea Pitch Owners, the intention was to ensure that Stamford Bridge could never again be sold to property developers. Irrespective of how many shares are owned by an individual, voting rights are limited to 100 per shareholder to prevent any one person or organisation gaining control of the CPO.

The CPO also owns the name Chelsea Football Club Ltd, which is licensed back to the club on condition that the first team play their home matches at Stamford Bridge. This means that should Chelsea move to another stadium in the future, they would not be able to use the name Chelsea Football Club without permission from 75% of CPO shareholders.

The company is a non-profit organisation and is not listed on any Stock Exchange. Its purpose is to raise the money needed to pay off the loan and then lease the freehold back to the club, on the strictly-defined proviso that the ground may only be used for football purposes. Fans are encouraged to purchase shares in order to secure the club's future. As of 2011, around 15,000 CPO shares have been sold, and approximately £1.5million of the debt has been paid off.  John Terry is the current President of the CPO.",0,1405556800,null,0,false,0,cizitjc,t3_2awcxq,t1_cizitjc,t3_2awcxq,null,1434752421,15,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,15

Although there have been some reports on prevalence and on physical height, these literatures are not yet reliable enough to be informative.

 Do consider though, while monthly payments go down, the overall cost will go up BUT you can change mortgage provider later on down the line if you're expecting to have a higher income in the future.

 I hope that helps somewhat. If you're applying to other places look at my other article for guidance on the process and your documents. It explains from once the application has been submitted (so after you've got your decision in principle etc).

Unless you're on fishponds campus, I'd say to go for the centre before you go for there. Fishponds is nice enough, but it seems a bit too quiet of an area for the average student.

General tips: be as social as you can, especially in first year. Don't forget to work; but be extra social in your first year in particular if you can! People are very friendly in Bristol and there's lots to do day and night if you look for it.

A woman may take her husband's name at marriage. That's it.

Allow me to expand.

Any other official changes of name must be carried out with a document known as a Deed Poll. A Deed Poll is essentially a contract with only one party. Strictly speaking, anyone can produce one and they cost nothing. There is not central register, it's existence is enough for it to be a legal document. THAT BEING SAID, it is a good idea to get one written up for you by someone who knows what they are doing. You can get them relatively cheaply online and those are acceptable.

As for changing names at marriage, a marriage certificate is only considered a legal document with regards to a new name for women. If a man wants to change his name, he needs a Deed Poll.

If a couple want to BOTH change their names upon marriage (your European example), the easiest way to do this is for the man to change his name with a Deed Poll and sign it with the wedding witnesses BEFORE signing the wedding registry. Providing he has done this, his wife can then use the wedding certificate as proof she has changed her name to the same as her husband:

&gt;1. Man called Mr. John Jones, woman called Miss Jane Smith
2. Man changes his name with a Deed poll document to Mr John Jones-Smith. This involves him and two witnesses signing the Deed Poll in each other's presence.
3. The couple sign the wedding register and their marriage certificate. The woman now has the option to change her name to Mrs Jane Jones-Smith if she wants to. Obviously in our scenario, she does.

The other way to do the above is to get married and then arrange for 2 deed polls (strongly recommended), but if you are getting them written up by a third party, then chances are you will have to pay for a second one.",0,1405561000,null,0,false,0,cizkn1o,t3_2aw3ht,t1_cizkn1o,t3_2aw3ht,null,1434753519,6,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,6

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/10967279/UN-80-per-cent-of-Palestinians-killed-in-Israeli-offensive-are-civilians.html

On the wider point I think there is a massive difference between how the Pro-Israel side views it and the Pro-Palestine side views it. The israelis think it's perfectly alright and the opposition think the death toll is too high.  You will never get everyone agreeing that the balance if ""correct"". 

I have noticed a swing in support from the news from mostly Israel support to more support for the Palestinians recently. This could be a precursor to a policy shift. The muslim vote in europe is more important the the jewish vote nowadays.  I suspect after the ""arab spring"" the current situation in Israel/palestine is seen by many policy makers to be unsustainable and destabilising to the region.  I've also noticed a real change in the american approach with many prominant americans including [ex-president Jimmy Carter openly calling Israel an apartheid state](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_and_the_apartheid_analogy#By_Jimmy_Carter).

true,Pokere,null,null,"Hey,
I had a similar problem, at least you've spotted it now. I spotted it when I attempted to pay my 2nd months halls rent, not ideal. Firstly and I hate to say it, the overdraft is your freind, right now, you don't really have too much of a choice and if you're with the right bank you'll get at least £500 of FREE overdraft. Now obviously you have to pay this back but you don't have to worry about it for at least 3 years. 

Hardship fund: Good luck. I have a friend who got one of these because she drank and ate out too much at the start of her second semester. They aren't huge and you'll struggle to live off them. You might not be able to get one because it's generally reserved for people who had money and now don't not people who don't have it in the first place (I understand what I just said sounds absolutely crazy but, bureaucracy).

Bare in mind that the systems weird and if you screwed up the application somehow you may have just landed yourself with the minimum loan. That's what happens when you don't do the form properly, they just give you the minimum (Fucked right?) My household income is somewhere near £60K and I don't think I get the minimum so I think you may have done something wrong there. Contact the student loan people. They're a ballache but it'll probably help.

Depending on your course a job might be a good idea but will definitely take away from your uni experience and potentially your grades. Try and get like 14 hours a week somewhere and at minimum wage that's £70/week ish which is relatively easy to live and have a good time on. this WILL impact your social life. Part of freshers year for me was just doing nothing with my mates chatting about the crazy shit we did the night before and I wouldn't have it any other way. Getting up for work after a night out is going to be hard, especially if you have a 5k word essay due in for tomorrow (Yes shit like that happens and no, to most freshers that is not a acceptable reason not to go out)

Next summer get a full time job and work hard. I have mates who work 60-70 hours a week over summer and hold down 2-3 jobs. If you're in a financial state where your parents can't help and the government are being arseholes I'm afraid you'll just have to stomach it. It's not ideal but it's worth it.

Bursarys are a great idea, you may get one because you have no money if you can prove your parents aren't disposed to pay. Other excellence bursaries are a good idea but it might be a bit too late. Have you got a disability? I've got dyspraxia and I got £3.5k worth of stuff from the government. Now it's the only way I can work effectively at uni and by no means do I agree with playing the system but, for example I said I had ""Organisational problems"" (Which is a problem associated with Dyspraxia) and they gave me a brand new ipod touch. That'd retail at like £200. I'm by no means condoning it but you're entitled to things like this if you're disabled, government fucks you over with loans play there own system straight back at them.

You really do need to sit down with your parents and explain this though and if you really can't think of a way around it they will have to loan some money on your behalf, as you have no house to put the loan down on. 

Finally £4k/year for halls is a rip-off. If you can, go self catered. Yes it's cheaper don't believe anything you hear about catered halls just cook. live off noodles if you must.
Good luck and most of all, enjoy yourself, it'll be the best year of your life and that's coming from someone who want's to do it again SO much.

Samuel Eto'o, Ibra, and now Sanchez (not to mention all the other attacking talent Barca has had and underutilized in order to serve Messi) are all excellent players who just weren't perceived as working well with Messi.

Now that Barca are clearly house it might be possible for them to adapt their game to suit Suarez playing with Messi, but it is unlikely because Neymar will also be up top. 

So I think it's certainly possible Suarez could be moving on in a year or two, not because a loss of his quality but simply the inability to please Barca.

I agree with much of the beginning of your post. But further down I disagree with two things:

1) Man United are not coming out of a transitionary period, they are just starting a new one. Their manager has literally run 1 training session with the team to date, and most of the squad won't have returned from holidays yet. There is a lot of work to be done there.

Not to mention that many of their senior players have moved on. Their team will look very different from last year. This is the very beginning of an era for them, and we all know the growing pains that can come with that. 

2) Liverpool's attack does not need reinventing. Not even close. We lost one player, our best player sure, but only one. The attack last season was so successful because of the players around Suarez as well as Suarez himself. His loss is not insignificant but we still have pace and trickery in the front line. Loads of it. 

I'd also argue that the diamond midfield with two strikers formation we adopted for a large part of the second half of the season didn't get the best out of Sturridge or Suarez, rather it got a little less than 100% from them, but we moved to that formation to accommodate both, as neither was effective enough out wide. Both of them had their best games when playing centrally in a 433. With Suarez gone we will go back to 433 allowing Sturridge to thrive, which I always saw as our best formation.

**Jordan Henderson** - A little because he's my favorite player, mostly because he's highly consistent in his progression. Because he made such a huge jump last season, to becoming arguably our most important player, I think this is the season he really shines--especially coming off a disappointing World Cup and that haunting red card. I'm expecting him to develop an exciting appetite for goals 

**Sturridge** - 21 league goals and lots of people hardly even remembered. With Suarez out of the picture he'll be looking to remind them, and it's not very hard for him to do. He's a harder one because even though he's so good, I'm not sure how high his ceiling is. I do remember him saying once or twice before he's nowhere near as good as he wants to be though, that kind of determination is reassuring 

**Coutinho** - Was already going insane in the middle of the World Cup, then  witnessed the disaster in his home country. He's obviously desperate to claim his spot in the Brazil side, he's 22 years old, will be focusing on his partnership with Sturridge as he's our lone striker now, and he's definitely not gonna let anyone take his spot. His ""arrogance on the pitch"" at Brondby was evident, the whole game reeked of his confidence. This lil mofo even tried beating the keeper from a free-kick he had no business to try shooting! I remember half-heartedly predicting about 5-6 months ago that a Suarez transfer would result in exponential growth for Coutinho and Sterling so...

Which leads on to the dress problem. Manufacturers of summer dresses seem to be having a laugh at our expense. Either they don't put any padding in at all so your nips poke up for all to see, or they do, but then it shrinks in the wash, leaving plaster-sized small triangular pieces of padding that you can't do anything with, unless you cut them out, because if you leave them in, they look as though you have large, triangular shaped nipples. But when you cut them out, it's nip o'clock again.

true,Antsonfire,num18,,"&gt;Do we stand a chance of even signing him?

I think we do. He wouldn't be an immediate starter here, but if the price is low enough (I don't agree with your valuation, though-the youth and English inflation would bring him up to £12 million easy.), I would think he'd want to sign. The CB pairings are more competitive at Spurs than at any other top side, so if he can prove himself, he might get regular minutes. 

&gt;Would you rather sign Lascelles or Stones?

Stones is more expensive, so Lascelles IMO. 
We're not in a dire need for a new center back. What we need to do is save money for a ball playing CM (if Holtby's not moved there, that is), a left winger and a left back. Between those three positions, that's a lot of money. Chiriches has performed well enough and has settled into the PL's style, so at the same time that their partnership has yet to be tested, I think trying it out for the majority of next season will show promising stuff. 

&gt;Considering as how Everton aren't in a position to sell, how far would you go to get Stones?

Not very, honestly. He'll be expensive, and we're not in dire need for an extra CB. If Dawson goes, he'll have to sit on the bench and start in Europa and FA games.   

&gt;Would purchasing more youth in the squad be a wise decision with players such as Zeki and Kane and reports of us going for young defender Lascelles?

I don't see what's wrong with bringing in youth. I'd much rather have Stones than Ferdinand, for example.  

&gt;Do we have anything to offer over Arsenal or Chelsea, if reports are to be believed?

A potential starting position, maybe. Aside from that, not a lot. Arse and Chelsea can offer CL and higher wages. We're facing an uphill battle for him. ",0,1405580468,null,0,false,0,cizs1sp,t3_2axn9r,t1_cizs1sp,t3_2axn9r,null,1434757275,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

But when you cut them out, it's nip o'clock again.

Hoorah for t-shirts.

&gt; So. It's a bit frustrating. Yes... I can hear the waves of sympathy from the pub's male patrons.

Get yourself a good recruiter. And I mean *good*. One that will know you personally, go for drinks with you and stuff. If you're in London there's a recruitment company called Gravitas who run an event called Digital Gravitas. It's a free meet up for mobile dev enthusiasts (made up of mainly of people they've already placed, so it's not salesy or anything, just fun). When you go you'll meet the recruiters. Get taking to them, they'll happily talk to you about jobs and stuff and maybe get you on their books. Plus you'll meet other people who they've placed and get good tips and tricks for the industry. 

Apply for jobs at start ups as well. Start ups are usually looking for someone different, rather than someone experienced. Find someone you'd like to work for on LinkedIn, write them a catchy email, tell them how much you want to work for them (because they are successful and you want to learn from them, because you're excited about the company and where it's going etc). If you're enthusiastic and stand out then that person will usually at least give you a chance to prove yourself (e.g. An interview).

Well as for teams not meaning anything, how many people do you know who support a football team from a place that is not their home town? It's no different than that. And if you understand/follow the sport then it's pretty easy to grow an attatchment to a particular team for any one of multiple arbitrary reason (just like in football or anyother sport for that matter).  
I think they are playing some of their games over here because the UK has quite a sizeable following of the sport, and it is a great way for them to expand their market. This year there are actually 3 games being played here, were peviously there has only been one. And if the Premier League were to play one of their matches over say in New York to try and entice more Americans to follow the sport (especially after the World Cup were it seems they really got into it) it could be a good way of heightening awareness of the game. 
I also think they do it because despite everything they really have  an affinity with us and probably see it as a good way of strenghtening that bond between our two nations.  

As for the rules of the game, it's pretty simple and quite complex at the same time. I suggest watching a couple of movies like Any Given Sunday, The Blindside or even better watch ALL of Friday Nights Lights as it's one of the best tv shows ever!!

Social science numbers are hard to generalise as trends because they get swamped in contextual factors.

They could also vary according to our how sentencing regimes change over time and government emphasis on mandatory terms, etc.

* Fish on a Saturday. As a Catholic that goes against my beliefs

* Oranges from Isreal. Since I feel (with an almost religious certainty) that the occupation is illegal, I refuse to sell to you

* Condoms. I don't see a wedding ring on your finger, so I refuse to serve you.

* Meat of any sort. As a vegetarian I refuse to facilitate the meat trade.

* Animal products of any sort. Ibid, but for vegans.

* *The Sun*. Page 3 is objectifying.

* *The Guardian*. Since I read only Lord and Lady Rothemere's *Daily Mail* I refuse to allow you to pollute your mind with that garbage.

* Fatty food. You seem like a fat person, so I'm basically saving you from yourself.

* Halal meat. I object to the ethics of the method of preparation.

* Halal meat. I object to the fact it is a non-Christian invention, and I think it is the thin end of the wedge with regard to Islam in Europe (or something)

* Nice wine. I notice that you are black, and I am uncomfortable with you drinking the same kind of wine as me because I want to preserve an elite aura about the kind of supermarket wine I drink. You'll have to go to another till I'm afraid, or maybe choose a different bottle.

I have my own list about which I'd allow and which I couldn't, but I bet that would differ from yours. An important point is that in many of these cases, there is something more serious going on than it simply being as inconvenient as I choose to allow it to be, so even though I would genuinely want to refuse to handle meat (that's the only legit one on the list), if I demand an exception for my belief then what is the principled reason for not allowing exceptions for any of the others? Maybe the bottle of wine is a bit different as written, although you'd have to be pretty stupid not to give some other reason in that situation. In a shop full of demands like this ai might have to move to three or four different tills, while other customers are also moving around trying to find someone to scan their goods. I think ultimately this ends with a lot of people losing their jobs (if automation is cheaper) or a *huge* employment bias for white men; both of which would be negative outcomes

It's an example about the nature of time's fluctuation. Before the explosion, the Daleks could be remembered in 2010, 2059 or any year. After the effects of the explosion were felt, they couldn't. This was before we saw the cause, but after the Doctor went to Bowie Base One.

It's similar to the effect of the time lock on Gallifrey. There was a point in time before the war, at which point Gallifrey was easily accessible. After the time lock was introduced, travel to it at any time period was made impossible, even if chronologically it's earlier in their history than when the lock was placed.

I suppose if you go back to the analogy of time being like a ball, picture 2010 and 2059 as two points on the outer edge. The Doctor goes through the 2059 point (*The Waters of Mars* happens), and only after that does the ""TARDIS explosion"" event appear in the ball, maybe somewhere near the middle. Lines of effect go out from this point and can touch both 2010 and 2059, erasing memory of the Daleks, but only after the Doctor has already visited the 2059 point and learnt what he has.

http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/chan24.pdf

Reading the Parliamentary transcript is interesting. and I'll quote the closing comments from MP's that actually have a backbone

Jeremy Corbyn: I support amendment 2, which was
   tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich
   East (Mr Watson), who made his case extremely well.
   Surely the issue is simply this: Parliament is here to
   scrutinise what the Executive do and to try to represent
   public opinion. We need to take advice from the public,
   organisations, lobby groups and so on, but all I have
   managed to find was an interesting and quite useful
   briefing from Liberty that came in yesterday—all credit
   to Liberty for getting a reasonable briefing together in a
   very short time—and a series of articles in The Guardian
   and one or two other newspapers.

   But this Bill has massive implications in relation to
   the ability of the state to dip in and out of people’s
   telephone and e-mail accounts. Because it takes on itself
   a global reach, it has huge implications all around the
   world. If we are to take the global reach to dip into
   e-mail accounts all around the world, what are we to do,
   as the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden
   (Mr Davis) said in an intervention, when an unpalatable
   regime decides to do the same and pitches up in a
   British court and says, “Well, you’ve taken these rights
   unto yourself. Why shouldn’t we do exactly the same?”?

   The implications of the Bill go a very long way indeed.
   **I am always suspicious when the House is summoned
   in an emergency and told,“This is an absolutely overriding,
   desperate emergency, so we’ve got to get this thing
   through all its stages in one day,” and Front Benchers
   from both sides of the House get together and agree
   that there is a huge national emergency. I am sorry, but
   what is the emergency?**

    801 802 15 JULY 2014 Data Retention and Investigatory
   Powers Bill
   Data Retention and Investigatory
   Powers Bill

    [Jeremy Corbyn]

  **There was a court decision some months ago, about
   which the Government have since done very little and
   made very few statements. There has apparently been
   an interesting debate between the Liberal Democrats
   and the Conservative party in the coalition. In the interests
   of public scrutiny, we should be given the minutes of
   the discussion between the Deputy Prime Minister and
   the Prime Minister, and of all the sofa discussions that
   have no doubt taken place. I thought that sofa politics
   ended with new Labour, but apparently it still goes on
   in Downing street. We need to know the nature of that
   debate.**

   What is the objection to a sunset clause that would
   bring the—to me—very unpalatable Bill to a conclusion
   in six months’ time? Such a clause would at least give
   lawyers an opportunity to make a detailed case, and the
   Government an opportunity to explain their case a bit
   better. It would give the Home Affairs Committee a
   chance to discuss it, and the Joint Committee on Human
   Rights a chance to examine it, which we as Members of
   Parliament would also be able to do.

   In an age of social media, it is interesting to see the
   numbers of people following the debate online and live.
   They are interested in social media, privacy and
   communication, and they all have views and opinions. I
   have no idea what all their views and opinions are. All I
   know is that as an individual Member of Parliament, I,
   like all colleagues in the Chamber, must vote on this
   piece of legislation without having the chance to reflect
   or consult.

  **This is not a good day for Parliament. It is not a good
   advertisement for Parliament. It is not a good advertisement
   for democracy. The very least that we can do is to agree
   that this wrong-headed piece of legislation will expire
   by the end of this year and force the Government to
   come up with something more palatable, more carefully
   thought out and more sensible in respect of the protection
   of privacy and civil rights for all. That is why we were
   elected to Parliament. We should be given the opportunity
   to do our job, and should not have to lie down in front
   of a steamroller and accept something that we know in
   our hearts to be ill thought out and wrong.**
   
Caroline Lucas:
 I spoke a lot in the debate earlier and
   was not going to speak again until my colleague, the
   hon. Member for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn),
   reminded us of how this debate looks to the public
   outside this place.
   
   As we have all said, this issue is of huge importance.
   Almost no issue that we deal with affects people as
   directly as their personal communications, and, therefore,
   is as sensitive. That is why it is so negative that we have
   given the impression that we simply do not care what
   people think. The public are pretty disengaged from
   MPs and Parliament, and do not have much respect for
   what goes on in this place. Today was an opportunity to
   begin to build bridges with them and to demonstrate
   that we can take these issues and their concerns seriously,
   and I feel so sad about the fact that Parliament seems to
   have flunked it. We have decided not to build bridges
   and have given the public the impression that we do not
   take ourselves seriously, so why should they take what
   we do in this place seriously?

 **Many arguments have been advanced on why it is not
   necessary to pass the Bill in such a short time. There is
   no serious argument that this is an emergency. If there
   were, it would have been dealt with three months ago.
   People can see through that. Their concerns and
   disillusionment with this Parliament will be redoubled
   by this process, instead of being addressed by it.**
   One reason why I support amendment 2 to the sunset
   clause is that it would rescue something from this unhappy
   state. If we at least said that over the coming months,
  we will do this piece of work properly and a review will
    happen, we could build some confidence among the
   public. **As it is, I regret to say that we have lost yet more
   public confidence today, at a time when we can least
   afford to do so.**",0,1405587661,null,0,1405589993,0,ciztmrx,t3_2axok2,t1_ciztmrx,t3_2axok2,null,1434757967,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Brendan Rodgers is a fantastic manager and I do believe he will be able to unlock the potential that Markovic holds. Don't forget that Suarez was incredibly frustrating until Rodgers came around.

Citing the removal of Dominic Grieve, the attorney general, and Ken Clarke, the pro-European former justice secretary, he said the reshuffle allowed Cameron to push forward with plans reported by the BBC today to curb the power of the European court of human rights. These proposals aligned the Tories with Vladimir Putin and others not concerned about human rights, he said. 

• **Clegg said Israel's behaviour in Gaza was ""deliberately disproprotionate and ""a deliberate form of collective punishment"".**

• He defended the Lib Dems decision to withdraw their support for the bedroom tax in its current form after backing it in the past. The party was responding to new evidence showing it was not working, he said.

I'm aware that we have theoretically got sufficient CCGT capacity to make up for peaks and troughs in demand during winter, but that relies on there being sufficient gas to run 100% of the fleet.  Towards the end of winter in early 2013 the fleet was outputting something like 2/3 of it's capacity because we'd run down gas storage so much.  So our present main concern is access to sufficient gas.  As far as I'm aware we've no long term contracts in place, so rely on getting gas at market prices.  Europe's gas production has peaked and declined, and Norway (from whom we get most of our gas) seems likely to peak soon [source](http://fractionalflow.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/fig-1-norsk-naturgass-prognose-2013-til-2020.png).  This will probably lead to higher gas prices, and more competition for gas (especially from Russia).

Adding more wind power is nice, but it also increases the balancing burden somewhat, as you're adding a lot more random noise to the grid balancing equation, which puts extra strain on the ccgt plants.

I think this is just Cameron trying to win back the votes of the far-right anti-immigration minority that he has lost to UKIP.  But that doesn't mean these people are representative of people who don't vote Labour or consider themselves ""right wing"" (including some of those people who vote New Labour).

Also, I'm not sure what relevance the *white* population has to this (other than the fact that it's typically white people who are against immigration, granted).  All citizens of this country, white or otherwise, get to vote (or not) for the likes of Cameron, and all people should be protected by human rights laws regardless of their colour, nationality or political affiliation.

That's the point of *human* rights - they're supposed to be the *minimal* levels of freedom offered to all human beings. Not just your ""own"" citizens, or people who share your political ideals.  Everyone.

Our Prime Minister is boasting about the fact that he *promises* to pass laws that will deny some people the basic right to be treated like a human being.

In the end it doesn't really matter if he's doing it to appeal to ""most people"" as you suggest, or a smaller minority as I suspect is the case.  The fact that he's saying it at all is shocking.

Holtby didn't get much playing time and was subsequently shipped off to Fulham. Capoue has looked bright enough, but he still needs time on the pitch. Paulinho has been nothing short of a disaster.

- £12m - £15m / Aurier
- £20m / Moreno
- £20m / Lovren (or another decent, vocal centreback)
- £20m / Bony

Total: £72m. 

That would add depth to every position in the team and would improve current players as there would be competition for each place (in my order of preference):

- GK: Mignolet, Reina, Jones

- RB: Aurier, Johnson, Kelly/Wisdom (?)
- RCB: Lovren, Skrtel, Toure
- LCB: Sakho, Agger, Kelly/Wisdom (?)

As for them going on sale, the next one is November. Not sure of the exact dates, but they'll be on sale for about a week. The problem is, when they go on sale, you're competing against thousands and thousands of fans for a relatively small number of tickets. There have been threads for the last couple of days about the sales, and a lot of people have been unable to get anything (many of whom are people that live locally and could pick from any game, not just the games that they can get time off for).

City is not a good choice to go for, if I'm honest. You need 14+ home games from the last season in order to get into the first sale, and by the time the second sale comes around for the City game there won't be nearly as many left. Being such a big game, everybody is going to want to go to it and they'll sell out very, very quickly.

For reference, I queued for 70 minutes yesterday for tickets, and was only able to get tickets for Stoke, and they were amongst the last seats available (obviously, they're not very good seats). I tried again this morning with hopes of picking up tickets for something else, perhaps Southampton at the start of the season - I was in the queue for about 90 minutes, and would have easily been there for another hour before I reached the front. While you're queueing you can see the availability of tickets - Arsenal and Chelsea were sold out in less than an hour IIRC, with a couple of other games following shortly afterwards.

It's possible that you'll get lucky and be near the front of the queue, but chances are you won't. In that case, you need to be prepared to settle for a less exciting game. You've also got to be prepared to not sit in the Kop - there's a lot of demand for tickets in general, never mind the Kop, so they'll be gone even quicker.

I'm not sure what your best membership option is though - there are different options for people outside of the UK, and I don't know what options give you access to ticket sales.

true,mucusmagic,null,null,"Brendan Rodgers has dismissed suggestions that Liverpool will struggle without Luis Suárez, insisting that they have both the personnel and the transfer strategy to continue making progress after the controversial forward completed his £75 million move to Barcelona yesterday.

Speaking on the day that Suárez was confirmed as a Barcelona player by Nou Camp officials, Rodgers claimed that Liverpool had done everything in their power to keep the Uruguay forward but were powerless to prevent his departure.

Any sense of loss over the departure of last season’s outstanding Barclays Premier League performer has been tempered by Rodgers’s confidence that Liverpool can still improve in his absence. Rather than be intimidated by the prospect of replacing Suárez, the Liverpool manager maintains that he is excited by the challenge and insisted there is no reason for expectations to be lowered.

“Selling Luis doesn’t lessen our ambitions,” he said. “We want to continually improve. Luis has been wonderful in his contribution over the years but he has moved on and I will concentrate on the players we have and who have won many games without him playing.
“We’re also working hard behind the scenes to get the best players — not a direct replacement but players who can add things to our game again. I think we will be stronger again this year in terms of depth.

“Our best last year nearly won us the title. It’s going to be competitive because everyone is strengthening, but the beauty is we are a young group and will progress again. It will be a really exciting season and this year we will have the belief to go with the quality.
“We have done everything we could as a club to keep Luis — he wanted to play in Spain and unfortunately, when a player no longer wants to play for you, we need, as a club, to look at it.”

Rodgers insisted that the club would quickly move on. “We have had great service out of Luis and it’s one that we can’t worry too much about now. It’s done, it’s gone and our focus is here,” he said. “There is a lot of work going on with the recruitment team in terms of getting in the right players and I am sure we can identify that.

“We have every confidence in the current group we have, plus the group we will bring in. We can improve them and hopefully they can improve to the levels Luis Suárez improved to, in the last few years.

“In my short career as a manager, I have lost people who I thought would be key players for us, but then you go away, reflect and ensure you bring in the right kind.
“And always, after that, my teams have been better teams. Luis is a fantastic player but he’s gone. This is Liverpool football club, not a small club, but one of the great ones in world football.”

Suárez arrived in Barcelona on Tuesday, but the La Liga club were unable to present him as their latest signing because of the conditions of the four-month ban imposed on the 27-year-old by Fifa as punishment for his bite on Giorgio Chiellini, the defender, during Uruguay’s 1-0 win over Italy in the World Cup.

Instead, his acquisition was confirmed in a low-key press conference in which Luis Enrique, the new Barcelona head coach, and Andoni Zubizarreta, the club’s director of football, refused to confirm whether they will appeal against the length of Suárez’s ban. “Luis Suárez is a Barcelona player for all purposes, but the recommendation from our lawyers has been to remain discreet,” Zubizarreta said. “But it is true that he is now 100 per cent a member of the club and we accept people here, imperfections and all.”

For Liverpool, who are considering making an increased offer for Ben Davies after Tottenham Hotspur made a £10 million bid for the Swansea City left back, life without Suárez began last night as a weakened side were beaten 2-1 by Brondby in a pre-season friendly.",0,1405593959,null,0,false,0,cizut65,t3_2axzse,t1_cizut65,t3_2axzse,null,1434758502,40,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,40

true,beyondReturn,null,null,"Your problem is you base everything on best outcome for every other team and worst outcome for us. If the league was probabilistic then we would have say 25% chance of 1st, 70% chance of 2-3 etc. but what you do is 25%&lt;100% so you exclude us completely, then 70%&lt;100% so you exclude us again. 


We are competing realistically with 4 other clubs (assuming Spurs do rebuilding that doesn't mirror ours), if by some chance 3 of them have excellent seasons we still only have to overcome the 4th. But you assess each individual club and you don't take into account it's rare for 4 clubs to all contend for the title, 3 was a big surprise last season. 


League positions are much like player transfers, surely you don't expect the 4/5 players we signed to all perform to their potential, then why expect that of our rivals. Which brings us to the most important part, how will we perform assuming our rivals don't all have great seasons? 
  
We have a good manager, a set system with clear playstyle, our players have played under this system for a season and half and we are getting other players who have played similarly. We might struggle at the start (staying around 4-5th would be struggle) but as players regain match fitness and get used to their new team mates and Rodgers finds out which of his new players are his starters we will improve. 
  
Our weakness is simple and it's a position that doesn't require lot of practice (for attacking teams), you simply buy defenders and ask them to defend, unlike midfielders they communicate and decide how to defend as unit. Lastly we have our attack, I fully believe we will see players perform at far above their level last year, Suarez helped them get to the next stage and now it's their turn. The identity in attack will go from combination of creating space and moments of genius to clear and brutal attack from the wide areas and Sturridge running behind the defenders. Our midfield will have direct and quick players and won't need to re-adjust their style. The affect of Suarez/Sturridge difference is how Hendo assisted half a dozen of Suarez goals while Coutinho did the same for Sturridge. With Sturridge leading the line it will be easier and more clear for our defenders, and it won't make us predictable either, unlike last season we will lose a bit of the push from central area (Suarez striker) but gain a lot of 1v1 our wide where we have talented dribblers. This will hopefully create space for Henderson to make more runs like he did the season before last, and hopefully also allow for Lallana to play box to box and get some goals. Coutinho will get game time and it's up to him to fix his finishing, but his passing will thrive when he has 3 options in 3 directions (more chance of one being open) than when he only had Suarez and Sturridge around the central area (often picking the quicker one with long ball). You only have to look at the number of times he passed diagonally to wide players only for them not to have the composure to keep the ball moving and wait for someone to run into the box.


I have little hope for knockout stages or cup competitions, BR has shown himself to be more capable in the league (more space to try new things and formations) than in cups, it can be a question of depth, but based on numerous games I've seen I believe BR is still a bit naive in that he doesn't accept that you have to sit back sometimes. In CL we will have far superior teams that impose their style and although I don't want JM 2.0 it would be nice if his game plans were different from the league.

That said I expect us to get top 3, we have bar City the most settled system and most players with experience and comfort in it. Players that will perform and play on a different level: Sturridge, Sterling, Hendo (more goals), Coutinho, Flanno (more cover from winger) and Gerrard if the world cup hasn't depleted him. As you can see nearly everyone is there and it's only because I believe 433 will get the best out of most of the players rather than 442 for SAS.

This is only for league games though - I'm not sure about how cup game tickets work. These sales are just for members though - you'd need a membership to get them.

After the big members sales, the remaining tickets go on general sale, where anybody can buy them. However, since this means a lot more people are able to get tickets, and there are a lot less tickets available, the general sales aren't a very good way to go about it.

In all honesty, you can skip a lot of the hassle by spending a little bit more on a hospitality package. You'll avoid the ~£30 membership fee, and you get a few other bonuses with it too (not sure of the full details but AFAIK you get a meal at Anfield), so the extra costs aren't too bad.

I wonder how you would feel if you ended up in a prison in a foreign country and discovered that you had no human rights because they didn't consider you to be a human being because your skin was the wrong colour or you voted for the wrong political party?

Or how you would feel in a future where an extreme left wing government gets into power?  Unlikely, perhaps, but possible.  Just as you now dismiss communists as ""enemies of the state"" they could do the same to people like you and throw you in jail without trial.  Does that seem right to you?

See, that's what you're suggesting, but with the foot on the other shoe.

When you give a government powers or let them take rights away from the people, you're also granting the same advantage to every government that follows.  Sooner or later there will be someone in power who you don't like or who doesn't like your sort and then you'll see that advantage used against you.

true,196884,null,null,"According to math, every team ""strengthens"" in whichever way they feel they need strengthening. Which means that, mathematically, teams will always apparently be stronger. Why hasn't an invincible team emerge yet? 

I think the reason we tend to see ""oh Team X bought player Y and Z, they must be stronger now"". But football doesn't work like that, players are not cogs and parts in an engine to be ""upgraded"". 

The answer is that ""the system is the key"". Which means the coach plays an outsized role in deciding how good a team will play (just look at the difference between almost identical teams led by SAF vs Moyes, and Dalglish vs BR, and AVB vs Sherwood). You have a playing philosophy, and drilled a set of players to play to that particular philosophy. If some of your players can't cut it, then you find better players who can. Look at the philosophies of the top teams last year:

Bayern Munich (Pep) + Barca : High-press, possession based, high line. 
Chelsea (Mou) +Athelico (Simeone): Organized defense, counter-attack. (Which is why when they both play each other, it was boring to tears.)
Real Madrid (Ancelotti), Man City (pellegrini), Arsenal (wenger) : balanced attacking, almost old skool 4-4-1-1, but with more skilled players. 
LFC + Dortmund : High press, *transition-based* attacking.

Coaches don't ""change their stripes"", so you can expect them to play similarly as long as they have the same coach.

Man City will play very similar to the way they play in the 2nd half of last year, and if they can keep Aguero fit, they *might* do better but I think they have pretty much tapped out their peak. Which is very high. Which means that they will probably win the league again because they are a really great team indeed. (possibly 90 pts this season).

Chelsea will always be contenders as long as Mou is managing them. But from their signings (Costa, Felipe, Cesc), I believe that the Mou's incredibly successful philosophy of super-organized defense + monster centre-forward who can hold the ball up, is now outdated. This strategy has been found out -- not by top teams (which it will still work) but by weaker teams who realized that this team can be choked to death by playing it narrow (watch last year's Chelsea game vs Stoke, or Crystal Palace). Having Diego Costa wouldn't change this that much -- I think they will still struggle against defensively minded teams. So I don't really think they will do much better than last year.

Arsenal -- So wenger bought Sanchez, and probably Khedira. Wenger is the most predictable coach in the Premier League, so I don't expect his philosophy to change. People say arsenal's problems is their attack. But I think that overlooked their biggest weakness -- defense. Huh? Yes, 2 words : Per Mertsasacker. Notice how Germany becomes a better team after they dropped this hulking-slow-as-a-snail piece of rock during the world cup? Mertsasacker is a strong powerful defender, the kind that British teams used to love. But this kind of defender has already being found out in the modern game which emphasise pace pace pace pace. That's why LFC, Chelsea, and Man City killed them last season. 

Which leaves us LFC. So, we lost Luis. Luis is incredibly perfect for BR's philosophy of playing at speed, and in transition (this means that we take advantage of the moments when the ball changes hand), because he is so unpredictable. Transition-based teams play on pace to catch teams in the moments before they get back into ""defensive shape"", with intelligence to read the game quickly to take account of the ""randomness"" as the ball pings around to find the right pass. To play this way, players need technique, intelligence and pace. That's why BR goes for players like these (and that's why I think Steven Gerrard will be playing less this season -- he is really not a ""BR""-type player, and it can be argued that BR bent over to accomodate stevie because of the leadership he brings in). Luis has all that is needed to play in a BR team -- pace, unpredictability, intelligence, and super technique. But so is Raheem, Coutinho, Henderson (his best trait is not his running, but his technique and intelligence to find space), and Lazar. If there is one man to replace Luis' playmaking, it will be Coutinho. Cou is the most technically gifted and intelligent player bar Luis. His best position is not #10 (the Messi role), but #8 (the iniesta role) so he won't be a like/like replacement for Luis. But he brings the same thing into the game -- ability to take advantage of transitions. 

Do we have the team to challenge for #1? I don't think so -- we overachieved last season, and Man City looks too strong. But our system is solid. The really key point to me this season is not how we replace Luis (our attacking philosophy will be the same), but (1) how Sakho becomes our new Alan Hansen (or Sergio Ramos) (2) how we phase out Stevie in place of a more defensively disciplined player. For (2), i suspect the person name is not Lucas. But Adam Lallana -- just a wild guess though!

Under these proposals we would still adhere to the European convention on human rights. The only difference would be who interprets what it means.

When the document was first written each country defined for itself what the document meant, through their own legal systems, and in 99% of cases they came up with the same definition. 

Then the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) was created, and which we have to abide by now. This court gets the final decision on interpreting the ECHR. 

This can lead to problems, when in the minority of cases when UK law contravenes EU human rights law, such as in the cases of prisoner votes and deporting terrorists, which upsets a lot of people when they feel the UK doesn't have final say over its own legal system.

Hang on, these aren't random street interviewers, it's a series of professionally managed media spots putting across consistent message. Such things do not manifest automatically out of ""strong opinions"". 

Regardless of everything else in these comments, you simply cannot state that Israel ""don't give a fuck"" when this is very demonstratively false. In fact, I'd go so far as to suggest they care far more about their international image than most other nations. 

Look at [this](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=site%3Anews.bbc.co.uk%20%22israel%20disputes%20this%22) web search. If they omit this phrase they get accused of anti-Semitism, it's so bad it's become official BBC copypasta. 

&gt;  because you are clearly in the other camp

No, I'm pretty neutral, the issue there is that Israel is mostly in the wrong. They are illegally occupying and blockading another land. Violent reprisals are to be expected and you'd likely do the same in a similar situation. That's the reality of the situation. 

&gt; The ridiculous thing is we (the UK and our citizens) have no right, no right at all, to throw stone at Israel

As someone who thoroughly rejected those wars (long before ""it was cool"") I have every right to do that. Particularly given that the situation in Israel is partly responsible for a considerable amount of conflict across the whole region. 

&gt;  We wouldn't put up with what Israel do either.

We did when we were occupying Iraq. Unlike Israel we didn't put up with it and left. 

We also faced a similar situation in Northern Ireland until we took a polar opposite approach to Israel's *and it worked*. The truth is that in Israel there are many in power who seek to control the entire region. A successful peace protest puts an end to their expansion plans as the occupation of the West Bank would need to end.

true,[deleted],null,null,"[This was yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2augdv/muslim_worker_refuses_to_sell_ham_and_wine_to/). At it's core this complete non story was about a single employee being a prat and the customer being so entitled she ran to the press to highlight said minor issue. This non story garnered top spot in this sub and prompted over 130 (and counting) comments.

Now, you'd think a small matter of a staff member wouldn't be so controversial, but the comments are very much concerned as we creep towards a society where the whims of Muslims have to be adhered to.  The fact that other incidents have happened like this, for example [Sainsbury's having to issue a similar apology when one of its staff refused to serve a woman using a phone](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/07/03/sainsburys-checkout-assistant-woman-on-phone-_n_3538909.html), or [Tesco banning customers wearing pyjama bottoms](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8484116.stm) didn't stop this from getting way more attention than the story actually warranted. Why? Scary Muslims.

[This one was a couple of weeks ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/28y61r/gay_couple_targeted_by_teenage_gang_in_homophobic/). Top comment - ""Thought it would be Asians, wasn't wrong"". The fact that *just* one week earlier another homophobic attack took place in London and was also a [top rated story in /r/unitedkingdom](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/27ox2s/men_sprayed_in_face_in_homophobic_attack_in/), but this time the assailants were described in the story as a ""white guy with a beard"" and two white women, didn't stop the very next case of a homophobic attack being automatically blamed on Asians/Muslims.

These are just a couple off the top of my head in the last few weeks. There are a *certain* few posters who will click [anything with the word Muslim in the title](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2abrth/what_is_it_like_to_be_a_muslim_in_britain_today/) and if it's positive they simply *must* poison the well.

It's gotten really insidious.

But if you mention it someone jumps in to deny it and then it's on you to carry out the arduous task of trawling through historic comment threads to show a trend that others have ignored.

Previously, citizens were free to do whatever they wanted that wasn't explicitly prohibited by law.
