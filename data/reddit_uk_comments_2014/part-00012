true,Basmati_Rice,english,England,"&gt;Would you go to Asda for an operation? 

No, because it's a supermarket, I would go to a surgeon who will be still being paid through my tax rather than me handing over the money voluntarily because I need the operation to live...

&gt; And free market health care is a horrific idea because inevitably people cut corners to save money or take advantage of people. 

Did you read the title to this article? Sure it's a little sensationalist but how can you say that on the comments of this article? Does your government not cut corners? Are they immune to greed? You know what the difference is when your government gets greedy? You can't do anything about it. You can't not pay. You can't debate the charges. You can't make any real changes.

&gt; Case in point: in the early 1900's milk companies used to mix chalk and water and sell it as milk to the lower class. People got sick, children died. When confronted about it their defense was ""It's a free market, they can get milk anywhere.""

I can't find anything on that. I would like to see some mention at least somewhere but until then I can only speculate. If a milk company did that today, what would happen? It would be all over the papers, all over the news, all over social media, people that were affected by it could pool money and sue them for damages. Do you think the rest of the people who heard about that would continue to buy chalk and water from them? No, they would boycott them and they wouldn't have a business to trick you with very very soon and they can get milk elsewhere that's the beauty, you don't like the way something or a company is run? Don't use it and don't fund it. I have NO choice in that matter with the government. I have to grin and bear it. So which is more preferable?

&gt; It's playing with fire, a ticking time bomb waiting to maim someone and when it does the answer will be ""it's a free market, they can go anywhere."" 

Fear mongering.

&gt; We live in a modern, industrial society and that leaving one's health up to the risk and gamble of a market and treating your health like a commodity like a car or television is the most dehumanizing stance a person can take

So, your solution is to extort everyone in the nation and then use a small amount of that money on healthcare. So in fact you're still paying for your healthcare, the money is taxed off you, it isn't free. In just the same way it would be in a free market system except this way you are having it forceably taken off of you like it or not but this way it's better because ""you don't feel like a car""  Rather than leave it up to a private company who has an interest in you being alive so you can do the thing they obviously want, pay, you leave it up to a government who couldn't care less because if you were to die, there would be another 1000 in your place and they don't get paid from a job well done, they get paid whatever the weather and when you do die they even steal a percentage of your money that should go to your grieving family, even in this horrible moment in your families lives the government can't stop themselves from getting their piece of the pie.

But it's also true that scoring rates have been on an upward trend (certainly since the 70's and the days of 2 pts for a win), so statisically scoring 40 goals in 1970's ( for instance) is probably even less likley than someone doing it today.

I wouldn't argue that if you dropped Tom 'Pongo' Waring (!) into Liverpool's 2014 front line I don't think he'd score 49 goals, but what he did was pretty amazing. No one would suggest that he was a better player than, say Henry. 

Some of the old folks would suggest, however, that if Henry was dropped into the 1930 Aston Villa lineup he could not have scored 10 goals in the season with such a heavy ball, and boots that made sprinting all but impossible. Plus he would have been kicked into row Z week in week out, without the protection of the ref!  

Fundamentally the table doesn't show who's 'best ever', it just shows who was best from certain eras. Also I wouldn't worry too much over how many games were played. It's worth noting on the table, and perhaps a goals per game column, but again it's easily taken into account.

Work hard and avoid absence and you'll be made permanent pretty quick. In the private sector the wage rises pretty fast in the short term. 

The downside is that the work is usually pretty soulless and bureaucratic, even when it becomes more challenging. Being compliant and organised is far more important than being intelligent or innovative. The atmosphere of these places is a bit like a high school and in the same way people tend to sink or swim based on their personality.

Yes, and one of them is that when their position is made redundant there is a process they go through that tries to find them other work in the organisation and falls back on paying them off so that they can afford to find other work at a reasonable pace. Redundancies happen in non-unionised workplaces, too, and often with much less warning.

&gt; Can't ditch the workforce over night when the Shiny-o-matic is released without consequence. Rollout needs to be coordinated to ensure that people aren't abandoned. We've seen from the eighties the type of effects that mass layoffs can have on individuals and communities.

""Among the findings in the AP's review:
â Pennsylvania has confirmed at least 106 water-well contamination cases since 2005, out of more than 5,000 new wells. There were five confirmed cases of water-well contamination in the first nine months of 2012, 18 in all of 2011 and 29 in 2010. The Environmental Department said more complete data may be available in several months.
â Ohio had 37 complaints in 2010 and no confirmed contamination of water supplies; 54 complaints in 2011 and two confirmed cases of contamination; 59 complaints in 2012 and two confirmed contaminations; and 40 complaints for the first 11 months of 2013, with two confirmed contaminations and 14 still under investigation, Department of Natural Resources spokesman Mark Bruce said in an email. None of the six confirmed cases of contamination was related to fracking, Bruce said.
â West Virginia has had about 122 complaints that drilling contaminated water wells over the past four years, and in four cases the evidence was strong enough that the driller agreed to take corrective action, officials said.
â A Texas spreadsheet contains more than 2,000 complaints, and 62 of those allege possible well-water contamination from oil and gas activity, said Ramona Nye, a spokeswoman for the Railroad Commission of Texas, which oversees drilling. Texas regulators haven't confirmed a single case of drilling-related water-well contamination in the past 10 years, she said.
In Pennsylvania, the number of confirmed instances of water pollution in the eastern part of the state ""dropped quite substantially"" in 2013, compared with previous years, Department of Environmental Protection spokeswoman Lisa Kasianowitz wrote in an email. Two instances of drilling affecting water wells were confirmed there last year, she said, and a final decision hasn't been made in three other cases.""",0,1389624232,null,0,false,0,ceoga9r,t3_1v3mkf,t1_ceoga9r,t1_ceog8xx,null,1431922836,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

And really, it isn't the Muslims who are dictating it *per se*. It's just easier for all concerned to buy in a one-size-fits-all product. And because most people don't know or care where their meat comes from it's easy to feed them stuff they'd otherwise be uncomfortable about.

There is a real question mark over Halal slaughter in terms of how unpleasant it is for the animals but most people don't really *want* to know the ins-and-outs of industrial meat production methods, Halal or otherwise.

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;**Brighton** ^i/ËbraÉªtÉn/ is a town on the south coast of Great Britain. It makes up most of the city and unitary authority of Brighton and Hove (formed from the previous towns of Brighton, Hove, Portslade and several other villages). Formerly part of the non-metropolitan county of East Sussex, it remains part of the ceremonial county of East Sussex, within the historic county of Sussex.

&gt;The ancient settlement of ""Brighthelmstone"" dates from before Domesday Book (1086), but it emerged as a health resort featuring sea bathing during the 18th century, was used as a seaside getaway by the Prince Regent, and became a destination for day-trippers from London after the arrival of the railway in 1841. Brighton experienced rapid population growth, reaching a peak of over 160,000 by 1961. Modern Brighton forms part of the Brighton/Worthing/Littlehampton conurbation stretching along the coast, with a population of around 480,000 inhabitants.

But last I checked, it is much easier now to just buy all that stuff online, from anywhere. The advantage is no longer about the actual goods - presumably it is about being seen in Brick Lane with all the other nathan barley types. 

But it depends on your interests. If you really are heavily into visiting art galleries on a weekly basis and hanging about with people who say ""yah"" a lot, then London is a good choice.

While London still has many advantages, it seems to be much smaller an advantage than it used to be - it no longer has exclusive access to most of these things, and cost means that it is often a disadvantage.

But help is good, getting to contact those most at risk is a beneficial thing and I agree with you there, but to use neglect, that's a very strong word with some pretty big connotations.

And as for my mother, I would seriously doubt that the expectation I needed help would ever come into contact with social services. I went to school and I was quite able albeit far from optimal body size. Being further pressured would not have helped my mother and doubtless would have affected me. 

And do we all pay for neglectful parents? That sounds a little cruel minded to me. Are we not contributing to people's welfare by supporting them?

Yep! Always a good thing to check first. From the [publication](http://www.pnas.org/content/110/44/17768?tab=author-info):

&gt; Conflict of interest statement: J.M. holds a joint appointment with Barree &amp; Associates and the Colorado School of Mines. She has also served as an advisor to Nexen in 2012. D.T.A. served as a consultant for the Eastern Research Group and ExxonMobil in 2012, and is the current chair of the Science Advisory Board for the EPA. J.H.S. has served as a consultant for Shell in 2012. D.T.A., M.H., C.E.K., and R.F.S. variously serve as members of scientific advisory panels for projects supported by Environmental Defense Fund and companies involved in the natural gas supply chain. These projects are led at Colorado State University (on natural gas gathering and processing), Washington State University (on local distribution of natural gas), and the University of West Virginia (on CNG fueling and use in heavy duty vehicles).

To anyone who thinks this is an easily dismissed ad hominem, you really need to understand how much industry money is in geology. Conflict of interest is an understatement, I would argue that a huge portion of geology has basically been corrupted by the oil &amp; gas industry. That is not to say that geologists aren't good scientists or that they don't do good science but there's a lot of incentive to play up to those holding the big bucks. Path of least resistance if you will.

I also know and work with grad students and post docs who basically can't publish because of restrictions made by the sponsor.

&gt;RESULTS OF THE 2011 FSA ANIMAL WELFARE SURVEY IN GREAT BRITAIN

&gt;4.12 Non stun slaughter methods are subject to additional OV checks. These 
include specific checks on timings required by the law for religious slaughter, 
which are calculated based on throughput. Cattle restraint pens for non stun 
slaughter are subject to approval by Defra. 
 
&gt;4.13 The FSA does not regularly collect data on the method of animal slaughter at 
an aggregated level. Detailed breakdown of specific slaughter processes and 
methods through the survey has allowed identification of the proportion of 
animals subject to slaughter by religious methods in that week. 
 
&gt;4.14 A total of 43,772 cattle / calves were slaughtered at 194 establishments, of 
which: 
 
&gt;o 1,314 (3%) were slaughtered by the Shechita (Jewish) method at 4 
establishments, with 10% of these were stunned immediately after 
bleeding. 
 
&gt;o 1,727 (4%) were slaughtered by the Halal (Muslim) method at 16 
establishments. 84% of these were stunned before slaughter, and 
less than 1% stunned after bleeding. 
 
&gt;4.15 A total of 307,512 sheep and goats were slaughtered at 202 establishments, 
of which: 
 
&gt;o 1,917 (less than 1%) were slaughtered by the Shechita (Jewish) 
method (all not stunned) at 4 establishments 
 
&gt;o 154,795 (50%) were slaughtered by the Halal (Muslim) method at 39 
establishments. 81% of these were stunned before slaughter and 
less than 1% stunned after bleeding. 
 
&gt;4.16 A total of 16,101,844 poultry were slaughtered at 73 establishments, of which: 
 
&gt;o 71,236 (less than 1%) were slaughtered by the Shechita (Jewish) 
method (all not stunned) at 5 establishments 
 
&gt;o 4,766,237 (30%) were slaughtered by the Halal (Muslim) method at 
29 establishments. 88% of these were stunned before slaughter. 

&gt;**4.17 The results indicate that the number of animals not stunned prior to slaughter is relatively low, accounting for 3% of cattle, 10% of sheep and goats and 4% 
of poultry. They also show that the majority of animals destined for the Halal  trade in both the red and white meat sectors are stunned before slaughter.** 

Or you've got an [RSPCA factsheet](http://www.rspca.org.uk/ImageLocator/LocateAsset?asset=document&amp;assetId=1232719611043&amp;mode=prd) with a reference to DIALREL paper based on information in 2007/2008: *""Assessment of the incidence and scale of religious slaughter practices""* which came to the conclusion that:

&gt;..74% of  halal slaughter of cattle, 93% of halal slaughter of ruminants and 100% of halal slaughter of poultry in the UK involved pre-stunning.

While it is not entirely perfect, the idea that Halal slaughter as it is carried out in the UK is largely inhumane is wrong.

EDIT: Also this study from Cardiff university regarding the Halal Food Authority (which requires stunning) singled out in the article, albeit it focusses on slaughterhouses in wales (from circa P26 onwards):

http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/cplan/sites/default/files/MM_Halal-Slaughter-Practices-Wales.pdf

&gt;HFAâs reasons for accepting/allowing stunning in their standard for Halal 
slaughter lay in an increase of meat consumption, especially chicken meat, 
within the Muslim community, which can only be met by the large 
slaughterhouses that are designed with electric stun baths to increase the speed
of production and to improve animal welfare. Thus the HFAâs message is: if 
meat consumption continues to increase and the price of meat is to remain 
affordable, âstunning to stunâ and not to kill will help to serve the Muslim 
community. Most importantly, animal welfare as well as human safety at 
slaughterhouse would be jeopardised if slaughter without stunning was 
performed for large-scale production. HFA argues that kosher meat can be 
produced with slaughter without stunning because, contrary to Halal meat, it is 
produced in low quantities, manually even in the case of chickens, at low speed 
and high costs, supplying a small percentage of the population.1",0,1389629616,null,0,1389630454,0,ceoi3j5,t3_1v3slb,t1_ceoi3j5,t1_ceof6yi,null,1431923758,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

&gt;..74% of  halal slaughter of cattle, 93% of halal slaughter of ruminants and 100% of halal slaughter of poultry in the UK involved pre-stunning.

While it is not entirely perfect, the idea that Halal slaughter as it is carried out in the UK is largely inhumane is wrong.

EDIT: Also this study from Cardiff university regarding the Halal Food Authority (which requires stunning) singled out in the article, albeit it focusses on slaughterhouses in wales (from circa P26 onwards):

http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/cplan/sites/default/files/MM_Halal-Slaughter-Practices-Wales.pdf

&gt;HFAâs reasons for accepting/allowing stunning in their standard for Halal 
slaughter lay in an increase of meat consumption, especially chicken meat, 
within the Muslim community, which can only be met by the large 
slaughterhouses that are designed with electric stun baths to increase the speed
of production and to improve animal welfare. Thus the HFAâs message is: if 
meat consumption continues to increase and the price of meat is to remain 
affordable, âstunning to stunâ and not to kill will help to serve the Muslim 
community. Most importantly, animal welfare as well as human safety at 
slaughterhouse would be jeopardised if slaughter without stunning was 
performed for large-scale production. HFA argues that kosher meat can be 
produced with slaughter without stunning because, contrary to Halal meat, it is 
produced in low quantities, manually even in the case of chickens, at low speed 
and high costs, supplying a small percentage of the population.1

I am not arguing that older players were better. I am arguing that I want to see their statistics included as well. I know that a player from 1928 has different fitness levels than a striker from 2010, I understand that, but I want to see what they have achieved as well. 

There is no major difference in fittness between 1991 and 1992 is there? Yet 1991 is removed from the list. Also I can understand the concept of how many games a player played in a season, it's not a reason to exclude someone because of the era they played in. Also on a table like this you can easily include how many games the player actually started, maybe how many as a sub (since they were intoduced). My point is that that sort of info can be included easily in a table. 

If you look at a list of gold medals from The Olympics or home runs in baseball they still show the achievements of Jesse Owens or Babe  Ruth, yet few would turn around and try to make an argument that they are better/faster/stronger than modern day atheletes, however we are able to see their records, whistle to ourselves and say, wow, that Babe Ruth must have been able to hit a ball, or my goodness that Bradman guy was a badass at cricket. 

Finally, it's not as if players in the 1900s were banging in 150 goals a season, their numbers are broadly comparable and in line with modern efforts. I will concede an uptick in goals from the late 1920's to WW2, I have no idea why this is. I'm kind of interested to find out why now!

I can't escape the feeling that The Premier League folks would rather tell you that *proper* football started in 1992, and you can pretty much ignore all that old stuff from before.

And it is skilled, you could not train a child to do it.

They will also know how to fix most basic things that go wrong on the train. If they cant fix it then they will call a fitter out.

Literally minutes later Eto'o scores to put us 2-1 up, and is promptly subbed for Azpilicueta who slots back in at LB, returning to 4 at the back. Or against Norwich, Cole comes off and Hazard comes on and again we go to 3 at the back with Ivanovic, Terry and Luiz again making up the back line. Just because we don't do it every time we need a goal doesn't mean we haven't done it nor won't do it again.

2. For 3 at the back you really need 3 CBs which we have when Ivanovic plays, Azpilicueta can push up to midfield as you say when at LB as Ivanovic can stay back in the back 3, but that isn't a good idea when Azpilicueta is at RB as Cole/Bertrand aren't suited to a 3 atb system. Plus given our strength in attacking midfield there's little point in asking a defender to play in midfield when we could bring on Schurrle/Hazard/Willian who can all provide the width and are all better going forwards. 

You do realise it's highly likely there's multiple reasons why Mourinho likes Ivanovic at RB? I also mentioned Ivanovic's set piece threat in my OP. Mourinho's an extremely reactive manager, he likes to have a lot of options available for almost any situation and a quick glance at our post-substitution results show how successful he is in making reactive substitutions. Ivanovic at RB gives him the option to go to a back 3 should the game call for it, which he doesn't really have with Azpilicueta at RB. In short it isn't ""silly"", there's evidence to back it up.

&gt;The **Hawker Hunter Tower Bridge incident** was an incident that occurred on 5 April 1968 when an RAF Hawker Hunter pilot performed unauthorised stunt manoeuvres at Tower Bridge, London, and elsewhere, to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Royal Air Force and as a demonstration against Prime Minister Harold Wilson's government.

I said it was rarely done.  I maintain it was rarely done.  

&gt;Ivanovic can stay back in the back 3, but that isn't a good idea when Azpilicueta is at RB as Cole/Bertrand aren't suited to a 3 atb system.

I'd rather sub off Cole/Bertrand for a third CB rather than sub in Azpilicueta.  Obviously this is arguable but I think Azpi on the field means we are less likely to be chasing games due to concentration failures and offers more going forward.  

&gt;You do realise it's highly likely there's multiple reasons why Mourinho likes Ivanovic at RB? I also mentioned Ivanovic's set piece threat in my OP.

&gt;Tower Bridge (built 1886â1894) is a combined bascule and suspension bridge in London which crosses the River Thames. It is close to the Tower of London, from which it takes its name, and has become an iconic symbol of London.
The bridge consists of two towers tied together at the upper level by means of two horizontal walkways, designed to withstand the horizontal forces exerted by the suspended sections of the bridge on the landward sides of the towers. The vertical component of the forces in the suspended sections and the vertical reactions of the two walkways are carried by the two robust towers. The bascule pivots and operating machinery are housed in the base of each tower. The bridge's present colour scheme dates from 1977, when it was painted red, white and blue for Queen Elizabeth II's silver jubilee. Originally it was painted a mid greenish-blue colour.
The nearest London Underground station is Tower Hill on the Circle and District lines, and the nearest Docklands Light Railway station is Tower Gateway.
Contrary to popular belief, the song ""London Bridge Is Falling Down"" has nothing to do with Tower Bridge, instead referring to the collapses of other various London Bridges.

true,RelaxedCease,IT,italy,"Schmeichel was a god no question, and me arguing that Cech is better is going to sound bias as shit because we're in a Chelsea subreddit, but I truly believe he has a slight edge.

Firstly there is the record-breaking clean sheet stat. That could be attributable to Mourinho's watertight way of setting up his team and Chelsea's amazing defense, so while I don't think this should be discounted, it isn't the be all end all stat that proves the point.

Secondly, and there isn't much to this claim other than personal view, I think the era Cech has been involved in is much more competitive than Schmeichel's. More goals are scored in modern football than 10 to 20 years ago and that makes the clean sheets more impressive. (Correct me if I'm wrong on this one, but growing up I don't remember seeing as many goals as there is now with the new balls and shit).

Lastly, the saves stat. You said ignore the stats in your post but the fact that Cech has the best save percentage is phenomenal. A keeper is there to stop the ball going in the net, and when someone has the stat for being best at that, as well as the other ratios and statistics that break records and put him above everyone else, its hard to argue that he isn't the best in the leagues history. I think the Great Dane was a huge imposing beast of a keeper, but I think Cech flies under the radar and your definition of ""disturbingly good"" applies more to a prime Cech than anyone else I've ever seen.

""The UK spends more than it earns.

So to get extra cash it sells bonds to investors for say Â£1 million and promises to buy the bond back after a few years for the original Â£1 million plus interest.
Investors in these bonds are starting to ask who will pay them their money back when their bonds mature.
Because of this and so as to assure all investors that the bonds are still a good investment and won't be defaulted on the UK government has taken full responsibility for these bonds.

This doesn't mean that Scotland doesn't owe anything now (although technically speaking it does) it just means that an independent Scotland would negotiate with rUK after a ""yes"" vote as to how much we owe them for our share of the debt.

Even simpler edition: It's like a married couple borrowing Â£1000 from a friend and promising to pay back Â£1100. The married couple start talking about divorce and the friend starts asking about their money and threatening to tell everyone that we might not pay them back. So the husband tells the friend not to worry he'll pay them back all the money himself. So the friend is now happy. The husband then has to make private arrangements between himself and his wife as to how much she'll pay him for her share of the debt after the divorce.""",0,1389633719,null,0,false,0,ceojp3g,t3_1v3ogj,t1_ceojp3g,t3_1v3ogj,null,1435531942,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Fair enough, but my point was we've done it before and I'd wager we'll do it again. Therefore I do not understand why you dismissed the notion of us adapting to 3 at the back as ""silly"".

&gt;I'd rather sub off Cole/Bertrand for a third CB rather than sub in Azpilicueta. Obviously this is arguable but I think Azpi on the field means we are less likely to be chasing games due to concentration failures and offers more going forward.

Not entirely sure what you're getting at with this. As I said before with the AM options we have there's little point in putting our RB into a more attacking position (although obviously it is an option), which I think is what you're suggesting. If Cole/Bertrand comes off for a CB, a CB would have to come off later for a fullback to return to 4 at the back, and it's unusual to change the CB partnership mid-game (as would be the result here) unless one of them picks up an injury. I can't recall the last time Ivanovic caused us to concede through a lack of concentration (Swansea in the league cup last season maybe?) so I don't really get the last part either. If I recall correctly I read a stat recently that in the league Ivanovic has never made an error which lead to a goal being conceded. 

Don't get me wrong, I like Azpilicueta a lot (incredibly underrated by a lot of non-Chelsea fans) and prefer him going forward to Ivanovic considerably. I just think Ivanovic gives us more options which Mourinho likes. Personally I like to see Ivanovic play more against better teams were we need to be more defensively solid and may need to capitalise on a set piece, and Azpilicueta against weaker teams which will sit back and let us attack them. But as I said before between them we have two fantastic RB options for almost any situation.

true,ChocolateSunrise,present,Hazard,"What is silly, for a club of Chelsea's size, is planning your XI around the idea that you will be chasing goals.  I actually reject the premise of this argument as I don't believe Mourinho game plans to be losing.  Until he says that's what is doing I just don't find that a reasonable argument in the absence of other information.  I think the only argument holding water is around set pieces (both offensive and defensive).  

&gt;As I said before with the AM options we have there's little point in putting our RB into a more attacking position (although obviously it is an option)

Azpi isn't just some crappy defensive fullback who can play midfield.  He is actually a great midfielder in his own right.  Secondly, just because you are chasing a goal doesn't mean shape and defensive responsibilities should be thrown out the window.  

&gt; I can't recall the last time Ivanovic caused us to concede through a lack of concentration (Swansea in the league cup last season maybe?) so I don't really get the last part either. 

Well then I suggest you watch this [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsgSF6XJHxs) from the Champions League loss to Basel.  Note Mourinho's body language at 25 seconds (slightly cut off in this video but leaves no doubt what happened).  This wasn't the first goal off an Ivanovic mistake this season but it is the most telling.  

&gt;But as I said before between them we have two fantastic RB options for almost any situation. 

Agreed.

We have seen players come alive and reborn under him, whether it's Gerrard in a new role when he looked to be fading out, Carragher absolutely bossing the back line for the latter half of last season, Sterling showing he's more than just some quick feet, TourÃ© still being an absolute menace to players of any calibre, even Downing being converted to an inverted winger and actually getting some decent numbers down on his stats for his last season with the squad.

As I said, Cech is an amazing keeper. There was just this aura behind peter though that made you as a fan feel you weren't going to score. Highly intimidating. Both teams keepers kept clean sheets at a period of dominance, so whilst the league is more attacking now I'm not sure on that. It's a fair point though but not one I can deny as I'm not sure on the stats myself and am too lazy to clarify. I'd probably agree.

I just feel that Cech has been a brilliant keeper with a brilliant defence, whereas peter was the key ingredient to a fair amount of their clean sheets. Not to say the rest of Uniteds defence was poor, but over a large amount of time ours has arguably been more solid for eight seasons, whereas theirs had it's peak for 3-4. 

Again, not to say what Cech has accomplished isn't incredible - it is. Never thought anyone would replace Carlo at the time. It's just Peter was that good for me.

Fairwolf's argument was that 90% of RBS' operations took place in London, therefore the debt should belong solely to London (or the UK not including independent Scotland to be more precise). This ignores the fact RBS is a Scottish bank, not least because its headquarters are in Edinburgh. It also therefore assumes that Edinburgh, despite being the HQ, had zero involvement in the decision making that led RBS to the state it has been in.

My argument continued with this logic, stating that if Scotland has so little to do with RBS (not where operations took place, not where decision were made, and not where the majority of the bailout was paid for), then RBS would cease to be Scottish should Scotland go independent. This goes against the illogical argument of the SNP, who believe RBS is Scottish in everything but its debt (that debt is 100% London's).",0,1389638881,null,0,false,0,ceolxae,t3_1v3ogj,t1_ceolxae,t1_ceolm2l,null,1431925641,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

the other problem is that people can entertain themselves easily now with gadgets where before probably more people would have been doing something active, atleast as kids, i think if you can stay healthy weight while you're developing you tend to stay alright into adulthood as you develop a lot of your habits when you're that age and get set in your ways as you get older.

Westminster's own argument is that rUk would be the continuing state and Scotland a new ceceding state. Under this arrangement the continuing state maintains all the international treaties and obligations - the new state starts from scratch. Westminster maintains that Scotland would not be due any share of the national assets. In any event the bonds have been issued in the name of the UK; it would not be possible to transfer any portion of them to Scotland without also getting the agreement of the bond holder.

The position of the SNP is that both rUK and Scotland would be successor states and Scotland would willingly assume its share of the UK's liabilities - assuming, that is, a fair and equitable split of the national assets. No assets - no debt. rUk would only become liable for 100% of the debt as a result of its own policy position and actions.",0,1389639096,null,0,false,0,ceom0un,t3_1v3ogj,t1_ceom0un,t1_ceoepm3,null,1431925683,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

Almost, but not quite.

As I said elsewhere, I don't believe that any court in *England &amp; Wales* has this power.

However Acts of the Scottish Parliament ARE subject to judicial review and CAN be struck down in the event that they are contrary to the provisions of the Human Rights Act.

The reason that this is so is because Acts of the Scottish Parliament are only legal because the enabling legislation (in this case, the Scotland Act) says so. As the Scotland Act was passed after the Human Rights Act it was possible to bind the Scottish Parliament in such a manner as it's a subordinate legislature.

true,Nickini,null,null,"&gt; What is silly, for a club of Chelsea's size, is planning your XI around the idea that you will be chasing goals. I actually reject the premise of this argument as I don't believe Mourinho game plans to be losing. Until he says that's what is doing I just don't find that a reasonable argument in the absence of other information. I think the only argument holding water is around set pieces (both offensive and defensive).

No, arrogantly dismissing the possibility of being in a losing/drawing situation is silly. Not having a plan B is silly. I'm not suggesting this is the sole reason whatsoever. Reject it all you want, I don't think Mourinho plans to be losing either, all I'm saying is he has a plan(s) for if we are. It's a fact we've used this formation at times during the season and I find the notion of Mourinho/the team not having prepared for it *extremely* unlikely, particularly given how well we adapted to it. To link this back to my point, if we have indeed prepared for it as is likely, this supports the idea that Ivanovic is liked by Mourinho at RB at least partly for this reason. 

We've been exceptional at adapting to mid-game changes in formation this season (switching to a 442 against Southampton as another example), I'd say it's a fair assumption to make that we prepare for various situations in training, Mourinho's not just going to change the formation and hope for the best. Mourinho makes radical substitutions to change formation as opposed to just swapping out players like for like, we adapt to our new formation well, the opponents don't and we capitalise upon this. [This analysis](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25380991) by Pat Nevin demonstonstrates what I'm talking about. 

&gt;Azpi isn't just some crappy defensive fullback who can play midfield. He is actually a great midfielder in his own right. Secondly, just because you are chasing a goal doesn't mean shape and defensive responsibilities should be thrown out the window.

I didn't suggest nor imply any of this whatsoever. Plenty of teams use a 3 at the back system as their default formation (very popular in Serie A, Liverpool used it earlier in the season and Hull have begun to recently) and cope defensively just fine, it's a perfectly viable formation, but as I said, we adapt to our new formation well, our opponents don't, and we reap the benefits, again, see the above video. 

I was comparing Azpilicueta in midfield to our other midfield options, as there's no point playing someone out of position when better options exist. If you think he's a better attacking option than Hazard/Schurrle/Willian then I don't really know what else to say to you. He's a fullback for a reason, giving him more freedom to go forward is going to have less impact than bringing on one of the aforementioned attacking midfielders.

&gt;Well then I suggest you watch this youtube from the Champions League loss to Basel. Note Mourinho's body language at 25 seconds (slightly cut off in this video but leaves no doubt what happened). This wasn't the first goal off an Ivanovic mistake this season but it is the most telling.

Fair point, think I blotted that game from my memory. But it's not like Azpilicueta is a completely error-free defender, very few are. In the Europa League last season he was giving away a penalty almost every game from a trailing arm in the box for instance.

The complaint that OP makes is obvious. Depicting violence against men on TV in such a lackadaisical fashion triavialises the issue.

If you have a look at BCC's *CCTV Code of Practice*, it makes no mention of using CCTV for this purpose. In fact, a 2007 draft CCTV Code of Practice did refer to 'traffic management', but was removed from the final version after a pubic consultation. As it stands now, the CCTV Code of Practice promises to not use CCTV for purposes other than what's included in the Code of Practice.

In addition to this, the Code of Practice has assured the people of Bristol that they will adopt the Information Commissioner's Office's guidance on CCTV use as their own (that strongly discourages to use of CCTV for issuing parking tickets), among other guarantees they completely ignore (even paying lip service to putting signs up for CCTV would be nice...).

So, my question to you is, why does Bristol completely ignore:

1) Their own published CCTV Code of Practice

2) The guidance given by the ICO on the use of CCTV

3) The opinions given by the Traffic Penalty Tribunal around CCTV

true,edjca,null,null,"The inspiration for Sherlockâs new nemesis? Well, thatâs elementary.
The showâs co-creator has previously gone on record criticising a certain real-life foreign Press baron who is an unashamed capitalist.
So it was little surprise when Sherlock Holmesâ new enemy was unveiled in last nightâs series finale â as a sinister foreign newspaper baron and unashamed capitalist.
The detective describes his enemy Charles Augustus Magnussen â played by Danish actor Lars Mikkelsen â as a âsharkâ who uncovers secrets about the great and the good which he uses to blackmail them.


He adds: âIâve dealt with murderers, psychopaths, terrorists, serial killers. None of them can turn my stomach like Charles Augustus Magnussen.â
As for the rest of the show, in a dramatic plot twist, Dr John Watsonâs new wife, Mary, shoots Sherlock, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, after Magnussen discovers that she had a secret past as an assassin for foreign intelligence agencies. She then steals the identity of a dead woman to marry the detectiveâs sidekick.
Luckily, she ensures the shot is not fatal, enabling Sherlock to recover and later turn a gun on the villain.
The not-so-subtle depiction of the evil press baron was created by the seriesâ co-writer, Steven Moffat, who has previously ranted against Right-wing media and declared his dislike of the Conservatives.


In an interview with the Guardian before the last general election in March 2010, he declared: âI hope the Tories donât win. Letâs not beat around the bush.â 
Former teacher Mr Moffat also launched a scathing attack on James Murdoch, the son of Rupert Murdoch and the then head News International, which owns The Times, The Sunday Times and The Sun. 
He said: âAre we really going to put James Murdoch in place of [the BBC]? âCan you imagine how s*** everything would be? Never mind the fine and glorious things that the BBC does, imagine how s*** everything would be! Stuff would be s***! Letâs not have really good restaurants, letâs have Kentucky Fried Chicken!â


In another possible indication of the views of the showâs creators, Sherlock himself was seen reading a copy of the Guardian during last nightâs episode.
And is not the first time the show has been accused of blatant Left-wing bias; the previous episode featured a thinly veiled attack on Boris Johnson, calling the Mayor of London âdithering, incoherent, and self-interestedâ.
Mr Johnson last week accused the BBC of bias after a spoof newspaper story which flashed up briefly on screen during an earlier episode of Sherlock.



The mock article revolved around the Mayor of London turning the Thames into a motorway.

Although Mr Johnson was not mentioned by name, the article said that the plans followed a list of âbizarre conceptsâ, including a ârecently-mocked concept of putting an airport in the middle of the estuaryâ â a clear reference to the mayorâs so-called âBoris Islandâ proposal.
The page included a quote from the âcurrent Mayorâ which appeared to mock Mr Johnsonâs use of language, finishing with the exclamation âhuzzar!â
It said: âWhen asked to explain how the system might move forward, or even be profitable, or perhaps even to explain the point, the Mayor, who was at a self-promotion event, was found to be dithering, incoherent, and self-interestedâ.
Mr Johnson said afterwards: âIt is elementary my dear Watson, I deduce a simple case of BBC bias.â He added that spending taxpayersâ money attacking Conservative politicians was the BBCâs âraison dâetreâ.
The BBC insisted that the newspaper and Mayor featured in the episode were entirely fictional and were not named or âpolitically affiliated.â

I understand that he doesn't have the legs to track back, but if we pushed Henderson a bit farther back into the box-to-box role, then he could be very effective there. Especially after he learns some tackling from Lucas and Gerrard, then Stevie will be, in my opinion, playing in the most deadly position he can for us.

Edit: This is what I propose

--------Back 4 and Migs--------

--------Lucas-----Hendo--------

---Sterling---Gerrard------Coutinho

----------Suarez-------------------

So in this play, Henderson would actually be just slightly ahead of Lucas, and very close behind Gerrard. That way, if Stevie makes a solid tackle, Henderson has the legs to recover the loose ball and send it forward. In defense, Henderson can sweep laterally across the field, and put pressure on players while Gerrard has the time to come back and help solidify the ranks. Lucas is a fantastic player, but he doesn't have the ability to play the killer pass or rocket a screamer in as well as Stevie. If Sturridge was to come on, then I would agree that Gerrard can come off, where Sturridge will be played farther forward, and Suarez will drop back to a CF role as he is strong and smart enough to both hold the ball and be the playmaker. Alternatively, if we want to start Sturridge, then I could see really any of the midfielders coming off, depending on how we want to play the game, and then re-arranging the player positions depending on who we have. General principle I've seen is that Hendo is VERY versatile and can play nearly anywhere. Suarez is very good in the upper half of the pitch, so he's quite versatile. Gerrard needs to stay central as does Lucas. Coutinho is more ideally suited for a central role as well, where he can survey the field on both sides and thread killer passes from there. Sterling stays on the wing, and Sturridge seems to be very adamant about staying as a striker so we can give him that.

Maybe. Food, housing, and cars are all more expensive in the UK, especially housing, but *especially* cars. We pay about 3x for ~~gas~~ petrol alone. Public transport is a better alternative here but isn't really *cheap*, and is pretty variable based on location. Obviously it depends on your exact situation but unless you're living in NYC and moving to a cheaper area of the UK, you're probably not going to save money, especially after you include all the costs of moving. Maybe when you factor in your education you will, who knows.

You are of course right about the cheaper healthcare, and I think you'll be entitled to free NHS treatment assuming you don't move here specifically for that. The higher minimum wage is nice too, but be aware that you'll be taxed more to pay for that healthcare. I don't mean to rain on your parade but I don't want you to have false hopes.

I'm torn on the subject at hand. Generally (Not including an equalizer such as a weapon) a man has very little to worry about when it's 1 on 1 against a woman. Most men will have 15KG+ and 5+ inches on a woman. There's no real threat there when it's fists vs fists. The man, 9/10, could end it there and then. Having the power but not using it makes you the bigger.... Person in any such confrontation. We're expected to show restraint with the extra power we've been awarded. 

The problem is, if you do fight back the woman has all the cards legally. Your punch is going to have left a pretty big mark on her whereas hers probably won't leave any visible signs. 

My advice, if you have to respond, is punch them in the stomach and don't be tempted by the face.

EDIT: Right.

I dont know why the 37,000 odd figure isnt in the report, but I note at the end of it that the survey was due to be repeated in September 2013. 

From what I have read, it seems that the methods use to stun sheep are not entirely 100% effective all of the time and are pretty tricky to carry out in practice - but that with a full throat cut severing both carotid arteries, there is either little or no difference, depending on opinion, for the sheep to register the pain or surprise before it loses enough blood to lapse into unconsciousness anyway. So provided that the slaughter was carried out correctly then it might not matter whether the sheep was stunned beforehand or not, either in the case of stunning being carried out poorly or being entirely absent. 

This Farm Animal Welfare Council report (http://www.fawc.org.uk/reports/pb8347.pdf , 2003) has this to say:

&gt;198. Loss of sensibility post-cut can be detected by observing brain function through
electroencephalographic methodology - a lack of response indicating certain insensibility
or death. The scientific evidence shows that sheep become insensible within 5-7 seconds
of the cut (3-7 seconds in goats).

With reference to head only electrical stunning:

&gt;164. Survey work conducted by Bristol University after FAWCâs previous slaughter
report indicated serious deficiencies in the accuracy of tong positioning with the
associated risks of ineffective stunning. Achieving a high level of accuracy at each
application is essential. We would recommend close monitoring by the OVS and
slaughterhouse managers with swift action being taken if performance falls below
acceptable levels (see Appendix D).
 
&gt;165. The design of the tongs and the layout of the stunning pens can have a significant
impact on the ability of the slaughterman to stun effectively. Operators must address the
issues relating to the design of the pen and the numbers of animals being handled.
Advice on pigs is now available but similar research is required for sheep, goats and
calves.
 
&gt;166. Work has been commissioned by Government on the design of more suitable
electrodes to improve both application and current flow. Results of this work need to be
transferred to the industry as soon as they are available and rapidly implemented
thereafter.

(This has some differences from the others, contiguous text sections marked in alternating normal/bolded text)

&gt;The MHS report states that the stun-to-stick interval recorded in those plants using 
head-only electrical stunning had a range of 3-70 seconds. It would have been helpful 
if the report had given the average figure, as well as the range. CIWF Trust is 
extremely concerned that in some cases the stun-to-stick interval was as long as 70 
seconds. 
 
&gt;Research carried out by Gregory &amp; Wotton (1984) indicates that 99% of sheep would 
lose brain responsiveness within 27 seconds of correct sticking.If in the worst case 
the stun-to-stick interval is 70 seconds, the stun must produce a period of 
unconsciousness of at least 97 seconds if sheep are not to be in danger of recovering 
consciousness during bleeding out. It is most unlikely that head-only stunning would 
produce such a long period of unconsciousness in sheep. Indeed, it is generally 
accepted that electrical stunning produces a period of unconsciousness of 30-40 
seconds in sheep. Taking the more cautious figure of 30 seconds and bearing in mind 
that 27 seconds are needed for 99% of sheep to lose brain responsiveness after correct 
sticking, it is clear that the stun-to-stick interval should be extremely short. Indeed, 
the European Commissionâs Scientific Veterinary Committee (SVC) has stated that 
for all species bleeding out should be performed within 15 seconds from the end of 
head-only electrical stunning (SVC, 1996). (CIWF Trust believes that sticking should 
be carried out within 15 seconds from the start of head-only electrical stunning). In 
these circumstances it is a matter of extreme concern to learn from the MHS report 
that the stun-to-stick interval is as long as 70 seconds in some cases. 
 
&gt;It should be noted that the figure of 27 seconds for 99% of sheep to lose brain 
responsiveness is based on the assumption that there has been correct sticking (i.e. the 
severing of both carotid arteries). Where only one or neither carotid is severed,unduly long stun-to-stick intervals will exacerbate the problem caused by poor 
sticking. 

&gt;**The importance of severing both carotid arteries is illustrated in the case of sheep. 
Gregory &amp; Wotton (1984) found that where both carotid arteries in sheep are severed, 
sticking takes an average of 14 seconds to induce loss of brain responsiveness. They 
found, however, that this interval was 5 times longer â 70 seconds â where only one 
carotid artery is severed. Where neither carotid is severed, it can take up to 5 minutes 
to induce loss of brain responsiveness.** 

European Food Safety Authority - ""Welfare Aspects of Animal Stunning and Killing Methods"" http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/scdocs/doc/45ax1.pdf

&gt;Pointed electrodes (electrodes with pins) give good grip and electrical contact, because 
they penetrate the wool and make better contact with the skin when compared to 
electrodes without pins. Electrodes with serrated edges may work in shorn sheep and if 
area of application is wetted. Though the heads of the sheep are small and the skin is 
woolly, often burning of electrodes occurs which leads to intensive carbonising of the 
electrodes. This, in turn, leads to a poor electrical contact due to an increased electrical 
resistance in the pathway. 
..
In order to check for clinical signs of recovery in sheep, the return of normal rhythmic 
breathing is the safest indicator. Resumption of rhythmic breathing occurred earliest 
24.85 sec (29.5 minus 3 x SD (4.65 sec) = 24.85 sec) after electrical stunning.

&gt;The maximum stun-to-stick interval can be calculated as follows: Resumption of 
rhythmic breathing after electrical stunning minus time to loss of brain responsiveness 
after cutting both common carotid arteries and external jugular veins: 24.85 - 17 = 7.85 
sec. 

&gt;(NB: used with a one-cycle head only method)When it is assured that all sheep receive cardiac fibrillation, the stun-to-stick interval is 
not critical to prevent recovery after the stun / kill. In studies of Gregory and Wotton 
(1984c), a stun-to-stick interval of 43 sec after the start of the application of current 
(which was 3 sec) was used without any sheep regaining consciousness. (NB - from my limited understanding fibrillation is rarely induced, however).

An EBLEX report (English association for beef and sheep industry) - Effects of slaughter method on carcass and meat characteristics in the meat of cattle and sheep By Dr M.Haluk ANIL; http://www.eblex.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/slaughter_and_meat_quality_feb_2012-final-report.pdf (Feb 2012)

&gt;It is claimed that immediate loss of blood pressure after neck cutting results in rapid loss of 
consciousness due to ischemia reduction of cerebrospinal fluid pressure (Rosen, 2004; 
Levinger, 1995; Levinger, 1976).

&gt;Blood pressure loss can be very disturbing to humans (Hamlin and Stokhof, 2004) and 
probably to animals of other species (EFSA, 2004). 
 
&gt;In cattle following exsanguination it takes a certain amount of time for blood loss to reach 
critical levels. It is estimated that 50 per cent of total blood volume is lost during 
exsanguination. Levinger (1995,1976) reported that 33 per cent of total blood loss was 
reached after 30 seconds, whereas Anil et al (2006) found 25 per cent was bled out after 17 
seconds. 

&gt;In sheep however, the time period is much quicker with 50 per cent being lost after 14 and 90 
per cent after 56 seconds (Anil et al, 2004). 
The critical low levels of blood pressure can be reached earlier, e. g. in sheep after about five 
to six seconds (Levinger, 1976) but not in all animals, e.g. cattle. Due to anatomical 
differences occlusions of the arteries in cattle can lead to recovery episodes in blood pressure 
in calves, however blood pressure fell sooner when no occlusion occurred (Anil et al, 1995b).

&gt;**Following exsanguination it is imperative that consciousness is lost rapidly. This duration 
depends on a number of factors such as the method of restraint, quality of the cut as well as 
species differences. Time to loss of brain function has been studied by various researchers 
who examined electrical activity of the brain such as EEG, evoked responses as well animal reactions and reflexes. Under laboratory conditions they found variations. Review of  results showed using time to flat EEG/ECoG from 10 seconds to more than a minute 
(Newhook and Blackmore, 1982a; Kallweit et al, 1989); loss of evoked responses from 10 
seconds up to 2 minutes (Gregory and Wotton, 1984c); loss of coordination up to 47 seconds 
(Blackmore, 1984). In contrast, abattoir investigations showed even longer durations before 
collapse was observed between 19.5 and 265 seconds after Shechita and Halal slaughter 
(Gregory et al, 2010).**

&gt;**In regard to sheep however, similar studies obtained much shorter durations between 2 and 
43 seconds (Newhook and Blackmore, 1982b). 
The implications of above findings are that following neck cutting delays in time to loss of 
consciousness would be serious welfare problems. However, some of the studies used do not 
necessarily prove presence of consciousness, rather showing residual brain function with 
possibility of feeling sensation. Nevertheless, ideally immediate loss of brain function should 
be aimed at for optimum welfare.**

I'm not sure why people always assume this is the main reason.  There are various physiological differences between men and women *on average* (though there's no particular reason why the best female cricketer must be worse than the best male cricketer), but there are also differences in funding, availability of sports clubs and teams for kids, numbers of people who are interested in the sport in the first place, and so on.  There are some sports (synchronised swimming, netball, beach volleyball...) that seem to be dominated by women, and others (snooker, motorsports) where men seem to dominate but it's not obvious to me what physiological advantages they could have.

All parties have limited resources. Even the Tories, who are well funded, don't have a bottomless pit of money to spend. If you only have a certain amount of money/volunteers, you're going to invest it in speaking to people who are the most likely to make a difference; that's your stable voters (ie not moving house all the time) in marginal constituencies. Same goes for policy- there's a less likely return (votes) on your expenditure (policy) when you're appealing to the younger demographic because of their poor turn outs.

true,ChocolateSunrise,present,Hazard,"&gt; arrogantly dismissing the possibility of being in a losing/drawing situation is silly. Not having a plan B is silly.

I don't disagree but most clubs at the highest level have a plan B that doesn't require three center backs.  Including Chelsea for the last few years.  It isn't a requirement by any means.  My point is only that the Plan B is completely secondary to Plan A because Plan A is obviously to win with the tactics you initially put on the field.  You wouldn't be choosing Ivanovic just because he allows an easier switch to three center backs, you would be choosing him because he is the best chance to win you the game from the RB position.  

&gt;I didn't suggest nor imply any of this whatsoever. Plenty of teams use a 3 at the back system as their default formation (very popular in Serie A, Liverpool used it earlier in the season and Hull have begun to recently) and cope defensively just fine, it's a perfectly viable formation

I'm not suggesting there is inherit flaws with three center backs as the basis for a formation.  I am saying if you don't have the personnel, including defensive wingers then there is a major tactical flaw.  Even with Azpi playing right mid, there is still a major issue on the left side of the formation, though I suppose you could shoehorn Hazard or Mata into that role.  The point I am continuing to make is you can't throw attacking mid/natural forwards into winger roles even if you are chasing a goal.  I'd rather just remove a holding midfielder and put on a striker, or allow one of the CBs to roam forward as both of those are more viable with the personnel we have.

In general, yes.  Individually, it's hard to even come up with a way of consistently classifying people as male or female (seriously, the IOC has done a ridiculous amount of hand-wringing over this over the last few decades and has never come up with any kind of answer other than ""we'll decide on a case-by-case basis"").  You get intersex people who are basically somewhere between male and female, people with unusual amounts of sex hormones (which cause many of the relevant differences between men and women), and trans people who have been on hormone therapy for a long time.

&gt; Here's what happens when the best womens tennis players challenge a mediocre male professional.

But if girls were given the same encouragement and opportunities as boys to get involved in sport, there would probably be far better female tennis players than the Williams sisters.

This is anecdotal, but there was a really stark difference in the way my brother and sister were treated (I'm an overweight nerd with terrible hand-eye coordination, so I'm irrelevant).  My brother was kind of into sports but pretty lazy, easily got involved with some local boys' football team for a while, and was strongly encouraged to do PE at GCSE level (he didn't).

Again, for most, but not all, an order placed before 11.15am for a fund will be executed at that day's valuation point.  The provider will then await details of the trade and book it to your account.  Generally this is completed within two working days of the trade date.  During this period, it is reasonable to expect for funds to be ringfenced whilst the order is executed and booked to your account.

If you do wish to sell any of your holdings in the future, the same time frame will apply.  Mutual Funds and Unit Trusts also settle on trade date plus four working days basis (T+4) and this will be the earliest you are able to withdraw proceeds.

Further to the above, not all funds are valued daily and this can prolong the timeframe.

true,OptioMkIX,null,null,"&gt;If electrical stunning is used before religious slaughter as long as sticking is 
done early enough, rising blood pressure may not be a problem. Neck cutting in sheep and 
lambs while the heart is still pumping should result in 75 to 85% of total blood being lost in 
the first 60 seconds (Blackmore &amp; Newhook, 1976). Therefore, during the powerful clonic 
phase, the carcass should have lost half the blood to be exsanguinated.

So, whats the takeaway from this massive wall of text?

1) That stunning sheep electrically using the head only method is not apparently 100% effective - but when it is, sheep are rendered insensible for about 30 seconds before they are able to breathe again which is a widely considered marker of them regaining feeling. (EFSA)

2) That sheep lose enough blood to prevent them from regaining conciousness between 5 (FAWC) ,14 (EBLEX) and 17 (EFSA)seconds after a full bi-carotid slash, although increased ranges are possible.

3) That the maximum time that can elapse between being stunned and stuck is about 7.85 seconds, which may be difficult to achieve in practice given that sheep are being processed quickly depending on slaughterhouse size - you can check the cardiff study for some processing rates.

4) These figures depending on date of study and methodology vary - it appears the general trend is for quicker slaughter practices by use of progressively extreme stunning methods.",0,1389646625,null,0,false,0,ceophja,t3_1v3slb,t1_ceophja,t1_ceonyqg,null,1431927471,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,myimportantthoughts,cnty-uk,It's grim up North London,"Yes, I think Molly slapping Sherlock is more a symptom of the widespread violence of the show than any specific male/female female/male violence. In the last episode, we see (SPOILERS):

1 non-fatal shooting

1 fatal shooting

1 pistol-whipping

1 face licking / sexual assault

2 people knocked unconscious, possibly by a blow to the head / neck?

4 other people knocked unconscious possibly by tranquilizers in their tea / punch?

multiple slaps

multiple pokes in the face

1 sprained arm/elbow


(I am sure I have missed some stuff but you get the idea)

Characters are also threatened with guns, a knife and a tire iron.

I am not necessarily disagreeing with OP, but Sherlock is not a great example. A few slaps to the face is getting off lightly in comparison to everything else that happens.

Men produce more testosterone and less estrogen *on average*. 

This allows men to develop more muscle which is advantageous for every physical sport I can think of. 


There will be outliers, of course. However for every outlier women who has the ability to gain lot of muscle there will be an outlier man who has the ability to gain even more muscle than her because their normal range is so much higher.. 

Then there's skeletal differences, tendon differences, muscle insertion differences. 

It's not a matter of there not being enough funding or not enough of a culture of women in sport, it's a matter of innate physiological inferiority when it comes to physical ability. 

Women evolved to be great at making children. Men evolved to be great at hunting. 

I don't think you'd find many sports women that would disagree with what I'm saying.

However, in recent years fracking is steadily turning the rivers and water reserves of some mining towns in the Midwest over in the States into a dilute petrol solution. Investigations are on-going, but at this point in time, some towns are unable to exist without continued reliance upon imported bottled water, as the taps produce flamable liquids and high rising toxicity levels. 

Stillbirths, whilst a deep conclusion, are recorded in high frequencies where regions become too toxic. Currently this is the case from the copper mines in the Andes, and also from the outbreak of mercury poisoning in Japan. 

I made the connection that fracking might eventually lead to fatalities from toxic poisoning, but so far the developed countries where fracking is being performed are too large for the impact to be noticable (and it is occuring in a desert with a very small population density, and not on a densely populated island with a large population and much wildlife nearby) and the locals whilst dismayed at the environmental destruction, have made do with the bottled water method.

true,Nickini,null,null,"&gt; I don't disagree but most clubs at the highest level have a plan B that doesn't require three center backs. Including Chelsea for the last few years. It isn't a requirement by any means.

I didn't mean 3atb is our plan B, it could be plan C, D whatever. Mourinho changes his tactics accordingly to what goes on in the game and is extremely successful in doing so. If he thinks the game calls for 3atb to overload their defence at one point he does it. 

&gt;My point is only that the Plan B is completely secondary to Plan A because Plan A is obviously to win with the tactics you initially put on the field.

Look at the amount of goals (particularly winning ones) we've scored post-substitutions. If plan A doesn't work Mourinho tries something else, usually to great success. Ivanovic at RB lets gives him the flexibility to easily switch to 3atb should he think it be the best course of action.

&gt;You wouldn't be choosing Ivanovic just because he allows an easier switch to three center backs, you would be choosing him because he is the best chance to win you the game from the RB position.

As I said several times now, it is (in my opinion) a reason he choses Ivanovic, not the reason. It's a positive Ivanovic brings which Azpilicueta doesn't. Do I need to say that again? 

&gt;I'm not suggesting there is inherit flaws with three center backs as the basis for a formation. I am saying if you don't have the personnel, including defensive wingers then there is a major tactical flaw. Even with Azpi playing right mid, there is still a major issue on the left side of the formation, though I suppose you could shoehorn Hazard or Mata into that role. The point I am continuing to make is you can't throw attacking mid/natural forwards into winger roles even if you are chasing a goal. I'd rather just remove a holding midfielder and put on a striker, or allow one of the CBs to roam forward as both of those are more viable with the personnel we have.

We're briefly transitioning into a 3atb formation, getting a goal then returning to 4atb, you're talking about an entire change to 3-5-2 with wide midfielders, as I said in my first post when we went 3atb against cardiff we were in a weird sort of 3-2-3-2. It's irrelevant what you'd rather do, Mourinho *has* done what I'm talking about and he's the world class manager. If you watch the video I linked you to I think you'll understand what I mean more as this paragraph suggests you didn't. 

&gt;Dave is a wing back because we don't play with wide midfielders (4231/433 don't have wide mids). That's the only reason. He is our best wide midfielder hands down.

Disagree on him being a wingback, at least not how we usually use him, going forward is just part of the modern fullback's role nowadays. Our AMs on the flank track back to provide the cover, but I'm not in the mood for getting anal over position names as so many are used interchangeably.

true,Seismica,cnty-uk,Teesside,"There is a clause of some sort which allows the government to take action if a sporting event of national importance is no longer shown on free to air TV. It's intended for events such as the football World Cup, The Olympics, Commonwealth games etc.

Formula 1 has a strong claim for this, with 8 of the 11 teams based in the UK (or 8 of the 12 at the time of the move to Sky) and a majority of the engineers and other staff coming from the UK. The UK also has great historical significance within the sport, having held the first F1 world championship race at Silverstone in 1950.

It was a very important issue for a lot of people, and so some MPs took it upon themselves to raise this issue in parliment. However, no action was taken. I'm not sure why, but I suspect the main factors are:

a) The sport was not considered to be of enough national importance on the same level as the Olympics, or the World Cup (For another example, see how all the big cricket events moved to Sky, such as the Ashes)

and

b) The races were not shown exclusively on Sky, highlights were still shown on the BBC. This meant that it was still technically on free to view TV.

There is also an agreement between the F1 rights holders and the F1 teams (at the time, the teams had a union called FOTA - Formula One Teams Association) called the concorde agreement, which amongst other things details the TV rights. Although not available for the public to view, it is well known that there was some provision thatmeant  F1 would remain on free to air TV in key commercial territories (The UK being the main one, Italy probably second due to Ferrari's presence). Somehow this agreement was bypassed as well.

What can I say? Bernie Ecclestone (F1 rights holder) is a smart chap who found a loophole to allow the sport to move to pay TV. In doing so, he really fucked the fans over.

Although a large number of Argentinian players have found football success around the world, few have made a name for themselves in Englandâs top league. One notable exception is Ossie Ardiles. Fresh off Argentinaâs victory in the 1978 World Cup, Ardiles and his compatriot, Ricky Villa, joined Tottenham Hotspur later that year, when the notion of overseas players was still new to the English league. Helping lead Spurs to victory in the 1981 FA Cup, the Argentinian stars became cult heroes in England. But on April 2, 1982, everything radically changed as Argentinian troops descended on the British-ruled Falkland Islands, asserting rightful sovereignty. A conflicted Ardiles returned to Buenos Aires two days later, his bright future with Spurs suddenly in question.",0,1389649203,null,0,false,0,ceoqq76,t3_1v0qu1,t1_ceoqq76,t3_1v0qu1,null,1431928149,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

The stuff that is being said on the other boards is actually fairly entertaining....people are hell bent on the thought that Sherwood is trying to drive certain players out of the club (Holtby/Capoue are the prime candidates) and that he wants to do this because he wants to stamp his authority on being the manager of the club because he wants it to be more than an ""unofficial interim"" post. They talk about how he has Levy's ear and is ""Spurs Wormtounge"" whispering things to Levy and he will get his way eventually. That Levy listens to everything Sherwood says and is in agreement.

But then the same people will turn around and say the only reason TS isn't moving people is because Levy/Baldini are going to bring in Van Gaal/Pandelli/Simone in the summer and want whomever that manager is to make the decision.

Well....which is it?....either Sherwood is a super-villian who has brainwashed Levy and will be the manager forever or he is an interim manager.  If he has soooo much power why is there even talk of another manager?

It really is amusing to read.

Personally i think Sherwood has probably been told that we have plenty of players and if he can make it work then we will see in the summer, if he can't then we will opt for LVG with Sherwood staying on as part of the staff. TS is just trying to win games so he can either manage Spurs or get another job down the line.

For example, you say it's more important to protect people's right not to be harassed, but how do you define that? What if I walked up to someone on the street and called them an idiot or a fatso? Surely this is harassment but would it seem reasonable to arrest me for this? What if I called an Asian person a yellow skin? Obviously that is racist and impolite, but should solely a statement land someone in jail? If I were to attack, or refuse someone service, or in some other way seriously threaten someone for race or whatever, than I could be arrested, but I don't think we should infringe on freedom of expression just to stop someone's feelings from getting hurt. 

I guess my point is I'm usually wary of laws which in any way limit people's freedoms, be it expression, religion, thoughts, protests or whatever, and I think it is better to look at it from the mindset of only limiting freedoms if it seems absolutely necessary, rather than look to shut down anything that might seem mean or hurtful and only make it legal if it seems nice enough.

That's nonsense. It relies on interested editors removing material that's uncited (or effectively uncited i.e. unreliable source or the source doesn't match the claim in the article). Of course often those editors exist, but often they don't or are outweighted by editors that are biased. Subjects that are emotionally or financially charged are particularly vulnerable. Try reading the article on Detroit and see what impression of the city you get! Of course fracking is emotionally *AND* financially charged.

If the facts in a given article *are* properly referenced then it would be much much better to reference those sources directly than the Wikipedia article. (And if not then obviously the article is worthless as a source.) ""That would take too much work"" isn't a valid argument because it takes precisely the same amount of effort as checking that the article is actually properly cited, which is more than just checking that there are floating numbers^([1]) in the right places. 

Edit: One extra point is that if something is the subject of intensive research (such as the environmental effects of fracking), then there will be such a large number of peer-reviewed sources that some may be out of date or even just statistical fluke. A search with [selection bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias) for articles may make it appear that there is consensus in the scientific community about something when really there isn't, or even when there is a consensus but it's different from the article. Admittedly this is hard to avoid even if you don't cite Wikipedia, and the centralised nature of it might even give it benefits at avoiding this type of bias. But a recent peer-reviewed review article would probably be better.

Such as no scheduled Sunday working or working on Boxing Day.

Or because the Olympics are on, where apparently rail staff in Cornwall deserve a bonus because of that (and staff closer to London may have to do a bit extra work, the sort of thing everyone else does without demanding excessive bonus payments). Seems to me that train drivers don't know the meaning of the term ""flexibility"" and start playing the strike card any time they're asked to do anything that might be even the smallest bit different. No wonder so many of the processes and procedures are stuck in the dark ages.

&gt; a train driver is more than just pushing the lever forward to make it go.

The DLR and one of the lines of the Paris Metro seem to disagree with you - both driverless systems and successful too. The challenges are different for main line heavy rail, but if we can make a self driving car, a train should be piss easy. All of the necessary data will be sent by the signalling system anyway (GSM-R and ERTMS), modern trains can already detect for wheelslip and other factors.

&gt; People complain about how much these people get paid should not be angry at tube drivers or the unions. They should be angry at the company they work for and negotiate a better wage.

Because all workers are in a position to do that, right? I'm sure McDonalds and Asda will welcome your requests for more money... probably by laughing you out of the room. The argument that the excesses of trade unionism in the UK can be solved with more trade unionism is laughable.

I think the anger is justified - they get excellent pay and bonuses through abuse of union action, and they don't even have to pay the fares that their actions affect. They get practically limitless first class travel, whereas the rest of us would have to shell out thousands per year for the same thing.

true,DoctorWedgeworth,null,null,"I'm guessing you don't have any savings so my advice may be controversial, but I want you to focus on savings first so that if you need to repair your car it's not going on another high interest credit card. So you pay probably 490/month off your credit cards and loans. Save as much money as you can every week and see if you can't replace the DVDs with a netflix or lovefilm subscription for a few months. Try to save 20/week if you can, that will give you around 500 in savings by June. Don't touch it unless you have to.  

Next, how bad is your credit rating? Because your best bet is a credit card offering 0% on balance transfers with as low a fee as possible. I know Barclaycard have a 1.9% fee, but I don't know if you'd get it. It might be worth phoning them up to see if you can be preapproved, because you don't want a load of credit checks in quick succession. If you can balance transfer then transfer it all there and you'll be looking at a monthly payment of around 40 total for the credit cards. Never miss a payment, because if you do they'll remove the interest free rate.  

If you manage to balance transfer you'll have around 150/month to allocate as you choose. Pay it straight off the credit card and by July you'll have paid off 1140 and the whole of the car loan. Pay the 300/month off the credit cards instead, and you'll be out of debt by this time next year.  

There's another option of not paying it off quite as quickly, and instead using the full 0% period but you have to be very disciplined (use a standing order from your bank). Eg. if you get 4000 for 20 months interest free, pay 200/month off it and put the rest in savings.  

If you can't get a balance transfer the most sensible thing to do is pay off the highest interest cards first, but some people like the 'snowball effect' of paying off the smallest balances first to clear out the cards.

Marin was a knee-jerk buy in March of 2012 I believe before the Champions League final, seeing how we were doing pretty poorly in the league at that point, he was an insurance buy just in case things went wrong, but it didn't seem to work out in the end.

Moses is a strange case.  I wasn't really happy with his purchase personally, but he did put up some good games at first.  But his second half of the 2012-2013 season was weak, and he was loaned as a result of it and hasn't been much to talk about since.  I don't think we'll be talking about him much later honestly, as I rate him under de Bruyne, who we couldn't even play, and he'll be 6th in the AM pecking order when he comes back as well.

Ba and Eto'o haven't really shone, but they were low risk buys who have scored some clinical goals at times.

The jury is still out on Piazon and van Ginkel.

I said both Thatcher and the unions pursued scorched earth strategies. This is not a desirable model for industrial relations and should not be viewed with any nostalgia.

And rail unions reflect the worst attitudes to industrial relations today - belligerent and with the only consideration being about the enrichment of their members, with no care for their employer, the industry, or the people who actually have to pay for it all. 

If it was any other industry, they wouldn't get away with it. But since it's quite captive (can't really be a train driver outside of the UK rail industry without moving to a different country, and the train companies currently always need drivers which can't be trained overnight), they can.

true,fidelcabro,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"I think the argument over the Olympics was due to the fact bus drivers were being given a bonus for working at that time. I agree in that instance it was a little out of order. There wasn't a strike though.

When they play the strike card it is usually months into negotiations when things have broken down terribly. And it is mainly due to conditions not with pay, many of these conditions are for passenger safety and for the better running of the network.

We will see people driving trains for a long time yet. Parts of the underground may well be more and more automated with a person in the cab but on the mainline there will be drivers. And they do more than drive, if something is wrong with the train they are the first ones to try and fix it. If they cant then the fitters come out. And lets not forget during the terrorist attacks on the underground it was the drivers that helped make sure people got out safely and quickly. 

If a group of workers gets together and negotiates together then yes they may get better conditions at work, it is not all about money. It is easier in a skilled position.

The union is working in its members best interests, a strike is not something they do on a whim, so it is not abuse. If it was a wildcat strike you would be right but they have to give five days notice of when a strike will take place. Yes they get paid well, that was not always the case, privatisation has made it worse. And they don't get first class travel it is standard class, and that is only for the TOC they work for, otherwise it is a 75% discount on the walk up fare although conductors do tend to look after their own. 

Free travel to work only works if your not on the first or last train into the depot or you live near enough to a station to be able to get into work. 

At times I think striking is counter productive due to the sentiments seen here. Working to rule would be just as disruptive and probably not seen as bad by the public. People would soon complain when trains cant run due to staff doing exactly what they are paid to do and nothing more.

true,cacafogo,num5,,"&gt; Frequently he tries to be too clever one on one having to resort to fouling opponents and has been lucky to come away with the ball on a number of occasions this season.

According to whoscored statistics, Chiriches has .7 fouls per game.  That is less than all of our defenders except Jan and Fryers, and less than most of the rest of the players in the midfield.  Also, to say he's lucky to get the ball is a bit insulting to his actual tackling skill - we don't go around saying Vertonghen was ""lucky"" to make a good last second tackle, we say he is great at tackling.  Credit should be given where it is due.


&gt;His passes out of defence are frequently straight to the opposition putting us under immediate pressure in our own half.

He has the third highest pass success rate (88.8%) behind only Bentaleb and Dembele, and significantly higher than Dawson (83.3).

&gt; It is better to have a player who can naturally read the way Dawson and Vertonghen do then a reaction player like Chiriches.

I won't argue that Chiriches reads the game as well as Vertonghen, but having 2.1 interceptions per game (more than all but Walker and Capoue) and essentially the same number of offsides won per game as Dawson indicates he isn't nearly as bad at it as the writer is implying.

&gt;There is a band of supporters who do not see the countless mistakes Chiriches makes every game.

I think this guy is looking for Vlad's mistakes so he sees them and remembers them, while ignoring all the good passes, all the good tackles, all the good runs forward.  It is a perception thing, and people do it with Dawson too (he has a ""brave"" header or blocked shot and people remember that instead of him mistiming a tackle and taking a yellow card) and really every player.

De Bruyne, I think it's just really unfortunate for him that he lost half of the season.

Only because there wasn't a chance in hell that the government would let one happen, and would be prepared to bend over to make sure of that. That's why they balloted and old Crow did what he did best - grandstanding.

That's the irresponsible bit.

It only takes a quick Google search to find plenty of instances where strikes do revolve around pay or conditions - or even threatening to strike on Boxing Day netting a cool Â£350 - http://www.itv.com/news/london/story/2013-12-10/350-tube-driver-bonus-to-avoid-boxing-day-strike/

&gt; We will see people driving trains for a long time yet. Parts of the underground may well be more and more automated with a person in the cab but on the mainline there will be drivers.

We'll see. Again, many of the inputs a driver currently has to think about are becoming automated, it won't be hard to design a train that can take those inputs and move itself accordingly. Even if there's a human (who wouldn't be a ""driver"") there to oversee it.

&gt; And they do more than drive, if something is wrong with the train they are the first ones to try and fix it. 

Other than reducing the delay slightly this isn't really a justification for keeping the drivers - as you say, there are fitters whose job it is to fix and maintain.

&gt; And lets not forget during the terrorist attacks on the underground it was the drivers that helped make sure people got out safely and quickly.

If it becomes anything like the DLR, there will still be a human on board who could still aid in evacuation.

&gt; If a group of workers gets together and negotiates together then yes they may get better conditions at work, it is not all about money. It is easier in a skilled position.

The point being that most people are in jobs where they can be very easily replaced if they don't want to comply, it's somewhat harder to unionise. It doesn't solve the problems, anyway - namely how piss poor our unions are at industrial relations.

&gt; The union is working in its members best interests, a strike is not something they do on a whim, so it is not abuse. 

Given some of the reasons they do it for, it most certainly is abuse. Even with notice, it is abuse - people still can't get to work even if it is with 5 minutes or 5 days notice.

&gt; And they don't get first class travel it is standard class, and that is only for the TOC they work for, otherwise it is a 75% discount on the walk up fare although conductors do tend to look after their own.

Officially, yes, but unofficially it's very different. Go on a First Great Western HST train for example, coach F (the buffet car and first class) is practically the FGW travelling staff club. I've read on rail forums how guards will happily let any rail worker in and on for nothing. I'm not sure what ""management"", as the unions call it, think of that.

It's a bit more than ""tending to look after their own"".

But even the official travel insulates them from the problems they help create. I'd love to have a standard class travel pass on the train company I use, as would the thousands of people who may be shelling out Â£4000 a year for a standard class season ticket. 75% discounts on walk up fares would be nice too.

&gt; At times I think striking is counter productive due to the sentiments seen here. Working to rule would be just as disruptive and probably not seen as bad by the public. People would soon complain when trains cant run due to staff doing exactly what they are paid to do and nothing more.

How about being flexible, just like most people in many other professions are? Demanding payments for this and that or strikes if they don't get it is just not on. I work in a non-unionised job and am paid very well for what I do, I certainly have no problem with a little bit of unpaid overtime (salaried) or bending some of the terms of my contract on occasion. Not too much mind. At least if I did go on strike, I wouldn't be putting million of other people in a bind.

It seems reminiscent of the strikes affecting ITV in the 60s/70s/80s, where highly paid technicians would down tools not a second later than contracted and would demand huge bribes to keep working past that. Or they'd want more money because the TV station has upgraded to colour, quite happy to see millions of pounds of equipment go unused while they have a petty dispute.

""Drugs are illegal, therefore drugs are bad"" is what kids are taught. That kind of education quickly falls apart for those growing up. And when people do get caught up in a cycle, where do they turn to?

As I said, it wouldn't be perfect. Some people wouldn't change their behaviour and wouldn't any get better... and some would, and there would suddenly also be a surplus of cash available to provide the care and help that group wanted.

true,lbspredh,null,null,"&gt;Oppressive situation would be only if UK didn't join EU in the first place and was just absorbed by them. USSR took Eastern Europe after II WW - that was FUCKING oppressive and Western countries didn't really care about it, nor they care even to this point, as is clearly shown by how some people treat Eastern Europeans, without realising what was the actual cause of them being poorer than western nations.

well yeah undeniably that sucks and is pretty serious oppression, all the same UKIP consider the EU to be oppressive towards their interests, and technically they are not wrong. oppression as a word does not carry strong meaning outside of such a context.

&gt;If I lived in the country where wearing a veil is something normal (i.e. majority of this country supports it) then I would have to wear it - no buts. I could try to make a case, to start a party which would oppose this (if I was allowed, parties in UK can say nearly anything) but if my party was not doing good enough what would be my point to join some international level committee of Muslims, which doesn't have in its principle anything to do with the discussions about wearing the veil.... especially that my only focus here would be to not to wear the veil personally and in my country, not in the whole world. Obviously comparing veil and such complex institution like EU is not an adequate example.

because you would want to bring down the entire religion in order to make sure they cannot force you to do a damn thing, and it's more like your country deciding to join the legue of muslims or whatever when it was sold to you as a trade union and feeling pretty fucking pissed off when they demand people in your country wear a veil and start making a bunch of other nonsensical laws you are meant to follow, and then the only credible parrties in your country refuse to do anything about it because they know what's best, their rich muslim backers are paying them to know that after all. and hey you brought the veil into this don't blame me for playing along to the extreme

&gt;Better example would be to live in the country with Muslim majority where most people would support being Muslim. My aim would be to completely take away Muslim faith in this country. I then join that international panel of Muslims, take their money and spy on what they do (all done officially) to use information to convince people from my country to abandon Muslim religion. Obviously I wouldn't be participating nor trying to change anything in that religion as I oppose it fully without proper justification. Oh and my main attack points would be for example ""taking off shoes policy"" when entering someone's house or anything similar (not major things like with Muslims bhurka for women which clearly is an oppression for females) or I would be using Muslim religion as an excuse that Hindu people start settling in my country - no connection whatsoever.

no you would be joining that panel to try and mitigate the damage they can do to your country's sovereignty, and you wouldn't want to bother talking about the issues of who the best prophet was, and all this after campaigning to be elected democratically into the panel of muslims on the promise of doing exactly that.",0,1389655708,null,0,false,0,ceotqas,t3_1v14vy,t1_ceotqas,t1_ceodtfg,null,1431929478,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"Absolutely. Unlike the US industry the DECC (UK Department of Energy and Climate Change) only permits three chemicals to be used in the water which is used to frack.

Polyacrylamide - which is the friction reducer I mentioned which is used in water treatment, kids toys, and making paper.

Hydrochloric acid - this is the stuff your stomach uses to break down food, and just keeps the pH of the water lower, which helps keep the pipes cleans and manages pH.

Biocides - does what it says on the tin, these things just stop beasties from developing in the fluid. If you don't use biocides then drilling fluids tend to get full of bacteria, like a stagnant swamp, and this can lead to some very nasty very dangerous gases developing due to the bacteria eating things - so you add biocides to stop the bacteria growing. To put it simply, this is like using soap to keep your hands clean, but for the water you stick down the hole.

Fracking doesn't require lots of special chemicals to be effective, it's a physical technique which is using pressure to achieve its aims, not chemistry, and as such there need not be complicated mixes of chemicals, and the UK fracking industry keeps it simple and just uses chemicals which stop rust, prevent bacterial buildup, and help the fluid flow more easily.

See, I'm not sure your point does stand. With all the talk of Soldado and Lamela deserving chances where is the clamoring for Holtby to get a shot? He's not been given a chance to play his actual role and still has a high assist count (albeit they came mostly in Europa). What's the problem with depth these days? Sigurdsson should move on if any MF does, he's not as good as Holtby.  
Carroll needs time to develop at a side like QPR, if Sherwood recalls him he's being ridiculous. I don't think I'm the only one who believes Carroll is not ready for a top PL team yet. Bentaleb has played great recently but how do we know his form will continue? What if he has a steep drop off in form and we then are caught with no AM to back up Eriksen? As much as people like to say Dembele is a CAM, he's not one. Sigurdsson I don't rate very highly as all he has (in my opinion) is a great long shot and free kick.

The call is less black and white as many would make it out to be.  The ref thought the ball had touched Gouffran.  This was the explanation he reportedly gave Pardew.  It was a hard strike and replays show Gouffran barely got out of the way.  The ref got it wrong in that the ball did not touch Gouffran.  However, Gouffran had to move to avoid the ball.  This basically dummied the goal.  The quality of the strike has many people avoiding this line of reasoning because they simply think, ""hard strike, top corner, no way Hart would have saved it regardless of Gouffran.""  I am not sure that this is true, but it is certainly the case that the ball would have deflected towards Hart had it struck Gouffran and that Gouffran was in Hart's way had he wanted to dive to attempt a save.

Does that mean it was the right call?  Not necessarily, but the fact that there are so many issues with the call makes it anything but straightforward.  Had Gouffran clearly been yards away it would have been an awful call.  However, he had to move at the last moment to avoid the strike and was close to Hart.

Sorry, do you mean when shale gas as a whole fails to make money or when individual wells do?

&gt;Seeing the utter disaster that is the nuclear contract I'm in no rush to hand out yet more subsidies to an energy project of questionable financials.

That's not a problem, no-one has suggested that subsidies should exist for the fracking industry, and they do not in the UK.

&gt;The future of fracking is suspect in the US where regulation is looser and the deposits are reportedly easier to extract. The contracts signed with the US government got an incredible deal out of the oil companies to the point where some of them were losing money in operation. Renewals will greatly increase the cost to the US population.

The US fracking industry, problematic as it may be in many ways, has dropped the price of natural gas by about $5 per cube, to $3, which is about one quarter of what China pays for natural gas, and is making US industry globally competitive again, and has massively cut energy bills for US householders - as well as making a great many private individuals lots of money in the business.

true,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,"There's always been players who have been the complete package, no question about it.  But they have been relatively few and far between, and mainly midfielders.  Nowadays you've got players all over the pitch who are strong in many areas of the game, like Aguero and Suarez who are the classic creator and finisher all in one, and even Bale, who has been deployed everywhere from left back to centre forward.

The thrust of Cox's article (which I read too) is not so much that it's an entirely new thing, but that these types of players are becoming more numerous and influential.  The last decade or so has been fairly two-dimensional in terms of world football's tactical development, pitting Barca's tiki-taka against Mourinho's 4-2-3-1 power and counter attack.  What we're seeing now at the likes of Bayern and Brazil's national team is the merging of the two streams... teams full of players who can play either system equally effectively, and be adaptable to any situation.

Players Like Lahm and Vidal (who recently was played at the centre of the back three for Juve) are a tactical manager's dream come true... they allow endless tinkering and experimentation in the set up, and can be used in multiple ways to nullify or attack opposition teams.  The technical quality of players is only going to get better and better over time, and I think we'll soon be seeing far more of these all rounders.

Ultimately, players who are good at one thing and one thing only are going to struggle.  I think we're seeing that now with Soldado... a truly great centre forward with a very limited skill set.  If he had another string to his bow, like pace, dribbling, size or power, I dare say he would've been higher on the scoring charts by now.

During Boris Johnson's first campaign he pledged to abandon Livingston's policy of closing 40 ticket offices, making him a popular choice for the London electorate who value the service. He made good on his pledge. He abandoned the policy and the issue disappeared from public consciousness.

During his second campaign there was likely little talk of ticket office closures (especially if there was no mention in his manifesto) because many probably believed it to be his 'default' position and assumed that the status quo would remain. However, a politician in office is only bound by his manifesto and as such has much looser reins in regards to other policies that he may adopt when in office. He had no mandate to keep the offices open and has made it his mission to outdo Livingston by closing them all, a hugely unpopular move.

What it comes down to is the state of British politics. The Electorate is, on the whole, apathetic towards politics. Most only cast their votes based on party allegiance, which quite often may be out of focus, and what the media reports during the campaign, which handily keeps the public ignorant of many issues. Very few take the time to read a manifesto and those who read Johnson's probably didn't question ticket office closures because it had dropped off the radar. It is true that he should have informed the electorate of his plans to make the closures but why would he? After all it would damage his chances of re-election.
Thus he was not adequately held to account over the issue and once he assumed office it was well within his power to make the changes he saw fit to make.",0,1389658629,null,0,false,0,ceov07s,t3_1v3rao,t1_ceov07s,t1_ceordiz,null,1431930079,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

To get into the top 10% of earners, you only need to earn Â£50k/yr. That's good money but not *that* much really.  And the figures on wiki for wealth (dated 2005) say you only need assets of Â£170k to be top 10%. So 10% really isn't that rich at all. But the top 1% is Â£650k+ and I'd guess that 650k in 2005 is maybe worth ~800k now, which again is decent but not very ""rich"" at all really in the grand scheme of things.

So I actually disagree with your statement that the top of the 90% and the very poorest are separated by a tremendous gulf. Comparatively the gap between the very poorest and the 11% richest is smaller than the gap between 10% richest and 1% richest. And I bet the gap between 1% and 0.1% is astronomical.

true,lawesipan,nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"You are viewing all of this on a very personal basis, when really it's an issue of class. Not exactly in the economic sense we're used to hearing about, but in terms of one group being oppressed by another it is quite similar. 

For example I am a member of the proletariat (as in I do not own the means of production and am forced to sell my labour in order to survive). I dislike bourgeois or rich people generally because I see them as exploitative etc. Now, it would be ridiculous to say I, for example hate the child of a member of the bourgeoisie (or for that matter any ""nice"" wealthy person) in a personal sense, however it would be quite reasonable for me to resent the advantages they have been given in life and the place they occupy in a system of oppression.

So, just replace Proletariat with woman/ethnic minority/gay/trans* person, and Bourgeoisie with men/dominant ethnic group/straight/cis gendered person. The analogy doesn't hold up perfectly I'll admit, but I think it does a half decent job of explaining it. 

This is not, by the way, to say that something done to you personally wouldn't be bad and of course in a real life scenario something would be done about it, however in a piece of culture such as this it is important to remember the context in the wider sense.

I don't know where this idea has come from that Holtby is a starting caliber box to box midfielder. Yes, he has played there before. Yes, he has said that he sees himself as being able to excel there. What is he supposed to say when asked such a question? Also, look at the context of when he said that. At the time Spurs had Bale and several others capable of and competing for his natural #10 role. The man wants to play and is the type of guy who would do anything to be playing and to be on the pitch. That being said, unquestionably his best position is in the #10 role. His career performances to date clearly demonstrate that. His best years by far were for Schalke. He was as you said predominantly deployed as a winger and as an occasional CM for Mainz. I know this, because I regularly watch the Bundesliga. And by no means was the best year of his career thus far the one for Mainz. In a little over a year with  Schalke he provided many assists and scored the occasional goal. He should have probably had about 10 to 15 more assists than what he had given the incredible wastefulness of Schalke's forwards. The biggest issue thus far that Holtby has experienced with Spurs is the general lack of being played at his best position and being given the freedom that he was afforded at Schalke. As I've covered many times before in this sub, Holtby has barely been played in the #10 role for Spurs. If I'm not mistaken, Holtby hasn't even featured in 20 matches for Spurs including the Prem, Europa and Cups. When he joined, the #10 role clearly belonged to Bale and so Holtby was played elsewhere. At the beginning of this season, Holtby was benched so that Paulinho and Dembele could play as #10.

I think he'll probably get snapped up by Barca or Real in a few years, he has a very attack minded play (very much like Mata) but he's stronger and has great footwork, he's not a player that you can just throw into a position, he has to fit into the team perfectly, and I think if we used Mata and Marin together in a different formation, we would of seen some seriously beautiful football to rival MC and Arsenal.

It pisses me off to see how much potential we had, and what we actually have now, if only Roman didn't sack RDM, I think we would of probably been at this moment in time a very scary team. We're getting better, but we could be so much more with a fresher mind in charge.

Police have powers under s.136 Mental Health Act to detain someone who presents a risk to themselves or others, in a public place, due to what appears to be a entail disorder. This detention then allows them to be taken to a place of safety to be assessed.

The assessment is then done by two doctors and other mental health professionals (not the police) who decide based on conversation and behaviour whether there is indeed mental health issues that require someone to be sectioned.

They have decided this is necessary in this case, which they don't in what seems like about 90% of cases (based on 136's I've taken in).

Your research certainly lends one to think it's not quite as bad for Chiriches. He's been solid, for me, when he's played, and he has a lot to think about with Dawson's lack of pace, Rose's questionable positioning in the defensive phase(although he looked to largely be positioned well against Palace) and the new found lack of a holding midfielder in front of him. That's a lot of issues to sort for him.

The author does mention the lack of defensive discipline from whoever has been fielded in front of Rose, but still places heavy blame on Rose and Chiriches. And I don't think that's fair, Eriksen and company, can't be left off the hook for passing their defensive duties. 

Everyone has to do a job out of possession and when one player doesn't, it leads to problems and creates a chain reaction situation. For instance, Eriksen being out of position allows the opposition to create a 2v1 against Rose which exposes Rose, no fault of his own, that pulls Chiriches around on that side as well and can open up space in front of the back four because there's no holding mid, yadda yadda yadda, one part of the defensive block breaks and the whole thing can go to shit very quickly.",0,1389665252,null,0,false,0,ceoxvgd,t3_1v4sun,t1_ceoxvgd,t1_ceosp44,null,1431931540,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

I voted for your party back in 2010 and regret it, not only because my electoral ward is a Labour safe-seat but also because I feel disenfranchised by some of the decisions made by both Nick Clegg and David Cameron; those including the various spending cuts made, the attempts at privatization made, the decision to push an Alternative Vote referendum which nobody wanted, the Great Firewall of Cameron which (surprise, surprise) blocks far more than just pornography, the mere consideration of an EU referendum, the trebling of tuition fees from Â£3290 to Â£9000 per year and the constant demonization of anybody who is claiming benefits.

David Cameron has exposed himself as a two-faced liar. I remember back in 2006 when he insisted the country needs ""a bit more of Supernanny and a bit less of the nanny state."" He then went on to demand that ISPs enforce an on-by-default porn filter to protect the youth which unsurprisingly blocks any content the government doesn't approve of (like torrent/filesharing sites, web forums, esoteric content, any sexual content whether filled with smut or actually helpful advice which teenagers could rely on, drug-related sites which even include ones that are helpful, etc.)

true,HannibalAntePortas,null,null,"His season with Mainz was his breakout season no doubt. I'm not denying that he had a good season, but rather am suggesting that his time with Schalke was far better. With Mainz he did have a good deal of flexibility and was the man who predominantly linked with Andre SchÃ¼rrle who also had his breakout season that year. Holtby's weakness as a box to box player for them was the same as it is for us. He lacked and currently lacks the discipline to play as a consistent box to box midfielder. Too often at Mainz, they'd press the attack and he'd get caught too far up the field due to his overzealousness. At any high level of play, that's going to be punished and exploited by teams, but especially in the Bundesliga where counter attacking football is played at its best. That is not to say that I think he is incapable. In fact, if he could improve his tackling and positional awareness, I think he potentially could be a solid box to box midfielder, but I still believe he'd be a better #10. At Schalke his overzealousness worked because of the defensive minded pair playing behind him in the midfield. They provided Schalke with the grit and backbone necessary to free Holtby up. They worked tirelessly to break up opposition counter attacks and sought out Holtby with the ball almost every time once the ball was won back. From there Holtby had the options of playing either a ball into the forward or out wide. His contributions defensively were just a nice cherry on the top for the team. The others carried the defensive load and that worked for Schalke. Spurs have typically avoided playing with two destroyers. At Schalke be was played as their creator (what he does best) and easily, and I'm giving a conservative estimate, could have had 10-15 more assists were it not for the wastefulness of the Schalke forwards. Despite the number of appearances he's made for Spurs, I don't think he's featured all that often in his preferred role, nor has the team setup been one that plays to his strengths and asks him to be the creator.

true,operatorhabit,,Downpatrick,"As far as living goes, I'd echo what most people have said here. I'm a final year undergrad student and have been living in Belfast for the past three years. I too would recommend Lisburn Rd for living on for a multitude of reasons:




1) Although parts of it would be perhaps be considered 'studenty' it does not have the same makeup as what the likes of the Holylands, Botanic or even Stranmillis would have. The diversity of residents along the Lisburn Rd is more varied and if students do happen to be living there they're more than likely going to be final years or postgrads. In my experience there's been no real issue as far as noise or disturbance goes so if you're going to need an environment in which you can rest and study then it's ideal.




2) As far as housing goes, you get a lot more for your money. I say this from having experience living in the Botanic/Holylands, Eglantine/Malone and (briefly) Stranmillis areas. Rent prices tend to be high in the typical student enclaves as landlords take advantage of young middle-class cultchies set loose from their mammy's apron strings looking to be located anywhere near 'the craic, hi' (I was once one myself!). Despite the high rent, the houses are invariably shit holes but people tend not to care because they're only going to wreck the place anyway. For the price you'd pay for a damp, decrepit wreck of a place in the Holylands or Botanic you'd get somewhere really quite nice on the Lisburn Road. In my experience, I'm actually paying less for somewhere vastly superior.




3) Depending on where you are, you can be pretty close to the university. I live on Great Northern Street (up near the Tesco) which is relatively far out as far as 'student' housing goes on the Lisburn Road. I've about a 15 minute walk from my main lecture hall (which doesn't bother me) but if you're living on streets such as Dunluce Avenue or Ulsterville Avenue you're not going to be much more than a 5 or 10 minute walk max from the Student's Union or Lanyon building (considered Queen's proper by most).



4) Facility-wise, Lisburn Road is top notch. If you're on the lower-end (nearer the university) there's a plethora of nice takeaways, relatively cheap sit-in restaurants, bars and late-opening shops for all the essentials. My own recommendations would include Thai Tanic (the best Thai food in the city imo), the Mad Hatter (a great traditional cafe), The Jharna (nice sit-in Indian restaurant with cheap lunch time deals), Chalco's (great Mexican food that's vastly superior to it's rival Boojum!) and Cuckoo (a quirky bar with nice craft ales, jamjar cocktails, ping pong, outlandish decor and pleasant clientele). Slightly further up the Lisburn Road things get a bit swankier with more high-end restaurants, bars, endless coffee shops etc but again you're not likely to find yourself in need.




Well this turned out to be a lot longer than intended but if you'd like any more advice regarding housing please don't hesitate to ask (I'm sure I sound like some sort of rep for the Lisburn Road by now!).

Though I do agree that the super-power thing was weird and I didn't like it. Also, when you say that ""he folded like a house of cards"" I don't see where you would think that. The only places that would make sense for that are when after The 10th Doctor stops being that srivaled up thing in that cage, and when he doesn't regenerate after he gets shot, and both have an explanation. When 10 went back to his original form, he was basically a god at that point (which I find as a cop-out, but what ever), so The Master was afraid cause he couldn't even hurt The Doctor, which he's always been able to do, even when he was defeated. In pretty much every instance that I've seen, The Master was able to put up a fight of sorts just before being defeated. He has alway been able to get one last punch in before getting k.o'ed But this time he wasn't. So he got scared cause this time he wasn't able to do a thing to prevent his inevitable. And the second, when he refused to regenerate, there are 2 reasons why he didn't. 


1) Because he didn't want to travel under lock and key with his arch-nemesis. And really, who would

2) Because not regenerating would be his victory over The Doctor. After spending a year with The Doctor, he knows how he feels about destroying gallifrey. He knows what that has done to The Doctor. He knows how alone The Doctor has felt, and what that has done to him. So, knowing all of this, he decides not to regenerating, leaving The Doctor alone in the universe once again. Basically torturing The Doctor with the horror of loneliness and depression. And so he finally got his victory over The Doctor


Now, if they do go your route and do a more Proffesor Yana type Master, I hope they at least keep the drumming thing, cause that added depth to his character and gave him a reason to be who he is, instead if just being a generic cheesy evil villain. Because the constant, non-stop drumming made him go so insane that he would try **ANYTHING** to make it stop. To get rid of that constant noise he hears that no one else does.

How about we play him in the VdV role with Lamela on the right and Chadli on the left? I'd love to see that line up vs Dnipro.

Gylfi is a bigger talent than Holtby. Holtby has the passion and stamina to run around like a chicken with his head cut off but Gylfi is the precision instrument you use to win games. He can turn and shoot in a dime. He can score with any part of his body. He has quick feet and is fairly gifted technically. We've only begun to scratch the surface of what he can do since we always play him out of position. If he started regaining his Swansea form he's be brilliant.

I love the guy, and really hope we can make him work. Sometimes, though, I just wish he went to Liverpool so he could get some real game time and develop there.

If you don't need to take out financing (car purchase, mortgage, loan) then the minutiae of your credit report does not matter in the slightest. If you *are* looking to take out financing then the major concerns are debt, earnings and credit utilisation. Searches drop off after 6 months and the only reason it's bad to have searches on your credit file (note: nobody can see if they were accepted or rejected) is because it makes it look as if you're desperate for credit, which is only bad when you *are* desperate for credit.

I wouldn't worry about it, and even if you are 6 months within making a big financial commitment the most important factor is going to be what you earn and what you spend, not whether or not you applied for a credit card.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"People aren't writing Gylfi off because he doesn't have talent, but we have players who can play the same role better.  You talk about the VdV role with Lamela on the right and Chadli on the left, but that leaves Eriksen out of the lineup. Put Eriksen on the left and you leave Andros (who has a big upside to him) out of the lineup. Put Andros on the right and you leave Lamela out of the lineup.

Gylfi does have talent, but he is and has been a very square peg in a round hole for us.  He isn't a winger yet we keep putting him out there and trying to pretend that he is winger despite the fact that he has no pace, isn't a great defender, doesn't beat his man 1x1 and it is a waste to have fire off crosses. He just isn't effective out there.

He is suited to play behind the striker, problem is that both Eriksen and Lamela are both suited to play in the same role and carry much, much higher ceilings for what they can develop into than Gylfi.  

Like you said, Gylfi has a terrific shot that he can get off very quickly and from distance, he is good with his positioning, he isn't a bad passer. However both Eriksen and Lamela (based on watching his Roma form) are far, far more creative, better passers, better movement, better on the ball when moving in a crowd and have solid shots. They are just more rounded and skilled than Gylfi and are suited to sit behind a striker.

I realize I could give you a point by point lengthy response about how your faith in a private corporation whose soul responsibilities are profit instead of a government agency that doesn't run for profit and is responsible to the people in the case of a democratic republic is misguided, and I really don't have to make the argument because anyone who has taken a history class at virtually any level has learned that a.) there has never been, nor will there ever be a pure free market, because b.) in times of lax regulation corporations have time an again shown us that they put profit over people. Sometimes that bites them in the ass, sometimes it doesn't. I look at you're little free market fantasy and all I have to say is ""Walmart"" and you can't really defend a corporates interests in profit over people.

But that's not what your reply had anything to do with because you come off as a someone whinging about having to pay taxes. You're part of a society that collectively determined that people will pay into a system that takes care of others at the most vulnerable moment. Deal with it. But my real fascination with your argument were the questions that it leads to: why stop with health care? I've never had to call the police or fire department in my life, so why pay taxes for that? They're less practical than health care, after all everyone gets sick but not everyone requires police/fire intervention. Or why should we pay taxes to maintain roads? Why are my taxes funding peoples education? This is when I realized that you really have no thought for others at all, because all of your stances are from the viewpoint of ""what's best for ME?"" You accuse me of fear mongering but you compare paying taxes to a mobster coming in and threatening the break your knee caps unless you pay protection money. So at this point I've realized that no, your argument doesn't have any merit whatsoever, practical or sensible. We can agree to disagree, that's fine. But I do have to wonder why you're so opposed to a system that is designed to take care of people when they need help the most.

The team welcome him back, (Tosh gives Jack a hug, Jack hugs and kisses Ianto, Jack forgives Owen and hugs him). Later Jack announces to Gwen that the rift is now more volatile than ever. Gwen questions him: what would tempt him to open the rift to which Jack replies ""the right kind ofDoctor."" As the rest of the team go for a coffee run, Jack sees the Doctor's severed hand glowing. He then hears theÂ TARDISÂ materialising, and runs towards it. The rest of the team, however, believes someone or something has taken him.

The ""Torchwood"" creator, best known to genre fans for his work in reviving the iconic Doctor Who franchise for BBC, says there's absolutely no chance that you'll see the Tardis pop up in the world of ""Torchwood."" And it has nothing to do with the fact that both shows are now separated by an ocean and Davies is no longer involved with ""Doctor Who.""

""No, because actually, The Doctor's never gone into Torchwood,"" Davies told reporters at the American premiere of ""Torchwood: Miracle Day"" on Monday, courtesy of NME. ""It's always been the other way around. Torchwood's gone into 'Doctor Who,' which I think is correct because there's a big child audience for 'Doctor Who,' and I think that would demand if we took The Doctor into Torchwood, it would be a clash of styles.""

Capt. Jack, the immortal Torchwood leader played by John Barrowman, was actually first introduced in a first season episode of ""Doctor Who"" in 2005 when Christopher Eccleston was playing the title role. His character proved so popular that Davies gave him his own spinoff show, which takes place in the universe of ""Doctor Who,"" but typically has included only hints of the Time Lord, at least during episodes of ""Torchwood.""

Since ""Torchwood"" has premiered, Capt. Jack has appeared in ""Doctor Who,"" in episodes that ultimately are linked back to ""Torchwood."" Barrowman's appearance in ""Utopia"" took place immediately after the first season of ""Torchwood"" where Capt. Jack heard the familiar sounds of the Tardis, and then disappeared.

Barrowman stayed on ""Doctor Who"" through the end of the season -- coming in at the third-to-last episode in the first place.

He would then return in ""The Stolen Earth"" and ""Journey's End"" with Cooper and former ""Torchwood"" star Gareth David-Lloyd, and would make a cameo appearance in David Tennant's final episode, ""The End of Time, Part 2"" on New Year's Day 2010.

That episode, however, was Davies' final episode. He handed the reins over to Steven Moffat, who so far has not really included much from Davies' universe that Moffat hadn't created himself. Because of that, it's unlikely Capt. Jack and Gwen will be paying a visit to The Doctor anyway.

""Torchwood,"" which premieres July 8 on American premium cable channel Starz, moves away from common science-fiction staples like aliens and cool gadgets.

""What I like about this year's version of 'Torchwood' is that it's just a concept,"" Davies said. ""There's some alien fun to come, but it's really taking an idea -- that we all live forever -- [and] dropping it into the middle of society and just watching the waves go out. Watching all of us react. Watching how our society bends, how it falls, how it brings out the best of us and the worst of us.""

true,rbobby,canada,Canada,"Do you have links to UK regulations? Are these nation-wide or vary by Scotland, Wales, etc?

In the US, in some states, there are literally no regulations on sealing; a driller could do a sealing job with old sneakers and be compliant. This seems to be the biggest flaw with the US approach.

You said ""every cement job in the UK is tested after it is completed to check its integrity"" and my question is whether this testing is required by regulation or something the companies do voluntarily? Further, who does the testing (who counts the chickens, the fox or the farmer)? Are the results publicly available? I'm having trouble believing your indirect claim that the UK has a 100% success rate with sealing.

Waste methane capture/disposal is also a bit issue. In North Dakota drillers are allowed to burn this (check out satellite imagery... shocking) for up to a year (though this apparently has been extended over and over again). What UK regulations and testing standards apply to waste methane? Are drillers required to report leaked gas events (and to whom)? How frequently have leakages occurred? What air quality monitoring is required by regulation (and are the results publicly available)?

Waste water capture, cleaning and disposal is also a significant concern. Open ponds, even lined, are a terrible idea... just let the ""badness"" evaporate into the air. Worse would be a leak or an entire pond draining into the local watershed. What are the UK regulations? Any regulations on reporting spills (and are the reports publicly available)? What happens with waste water that can't be cleaned? Are there regulations covering its disposal (i.e. can it be injected into dry wells) and monitoring (you don't want someone drilling into it in 50 years so a permanent record will be required)?

What about long term uncertainty? Is there any regulations requiring appropriate insurance coverage for future environmental cleanup costs? It's easy enough to structure companies such that when faced with a big environmental bill 10 years from now the company just goes bankrupt (literally the only asset is the wellhead). Given that the rate of sealing failures in the UK is unknown (how many sealing jobs fail over 10 years? 20 years) it seems sensible to require companies to set aside financial resources to handle these problems.

&gt;

&gt;**Petrichor** (/ËpÉtrÉ¨kÉÉr/) is the scent of rain on dry earth, or the scent of dust after rain. The word is constructed from Greek, petros, meaning stone + ichor, the fluid that flows in the veins of the gods in Greek mythology. It is defined as ""the distinctive scent which accompanies the first rain after a long warm dry spell"".

&gt;The term was coined in 1964 by two Australian researchers, Bear and Thomas, for an article in the journal Nature. In the article, the authors describe how the smell derives from an oil exuded by certain plants during dry periods, whereupon it is absorbed by clay-based soils and rocks. During rain, the oil is released into the air along with another compound, geosmin, a metabolic by-product of certain Actinobacteria, which is emitted by wet soil, producing the distinctive scent; ozone may also be present if there is lightning. In a follow-up paper, Bear and Thomas (1965) showed that the oil retards seed germination and early plant growth. This would indicate that the plants exude the oil in order to safeguard the seeds from germination under duress.

&gt;""Community-based samples"" show a symmetry in the rates women and men are perpetrators or victims of certain forms of domestic violence. ""Agency samples"" and ""hospital samples"" show that men commit up to 90% domestic violence.

&gt;Survey approaches to gathering domestic violence statistics tend to show parity in the use of violence by both men and women against partners, while approaches using data from reports of domestic violence offending tends to show women experiencing violence from male partners as the majority of cases (over 80%).

&gt;Research based on the survey-based Conflict Tactics Scale, a measure of intrafamily conflict and violence focusing on the adults in the family developed by Murray Straus (1979)[clarification needed], includes national surveys on the prevalence of domestic violence in the United States and other countries. These include the two U.S. National Family Violence Surveys (1975 and 1985) and the National Violence Against Women Survey (2000) (Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000). This research has tended to show that men and women are equally violent. The National Violence Against Women Survey (2000) found that women experience more intimate partner violence than do men, women experience more chronic and injurious physical assaults at the hands of intimate partners than do men, and that violence perpetrated against women by intimates is often accompanied by emotionally abusive and controlling behavior (Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000).

&gt;Research based on reported domestic violence or on police records show men to be the perpetrators and women the victims of most domestic violence.

&gt;However, the mere intervention of police may introduce a degree of gender bias into reporting.

&gt;When faced with a domestic violence situation, police officers often find it far easier to take action against a male protagonist than a female one.[citation needed] Removing one party will normally defuse an altercation. Often police will choose the man, possibly due to simple gender bias, and possibly because his arrest is not normally going to involve any children[citation needed]; while removing the woman may entail involving other social services to care for the children for a time, something that may not be in the children's best interests, or may cause a significant delay. The fact that the majority of police officers are also male and that non-domestic offending is often committed by males may also influence an officer's decision.[citation needed]

&gt;Also, police responding to a complaint may act more favorably to the complainant than other parties (although some researchers also report instances where men were attacked, called the police instead of fighting back, and yet were arrested themselves).

&gt;Some researchers have found that women are more likely to report domestic violence to police than men are, and this is a cause of gender bias. For example, in Ireland, 29% of female victims and 5% of male victims of domestic abuse reported the abuse to the police. In the United States, male victims are less likely than female victims to report rape, physical assault, or stalking.

&gt;Injury and hospital admission statistics also suggest that males are more frequently perpetrators of injury causing violence.[citation needed] However, both the large difference in likelihood of reporting noted above, and the relative strengths and other physical differences between males and females, could be factors in this reporting bias, as males may be more likely to injur ...

IMO some people may fail to take into account that the 9th doctor is an amalgamation of many things. He's not merely Eccleston in a role - he is that, but he's also made up from the scripts of RTD/Moff/etc., he's made up of the director's instructions, he's formed as a character by reacting to the other characters/actors as they are filming, and he's lots of other things, besides.

I think that the 9th doctor was awesome for all the reasons listed in the posts above. He was, dare I say it, fantastic. Same thing here, my friends and I didn't care for Tennant at first because he'd usurped Eccleston. ""Who is this wimp wearing Chris' jacket? Oh man, please no bring the real doctor back ..."" It's a shame that tiny special, where Rose asks 10 if he can change back, wasn't included in the regular show ... when I saw it much later I knew how she'd felt!

Right, we didn't recognize Tennant and of course nobody had any idea how his tenure would go. I gradually gravitated to 10th doctor as solid fave doctor but still dig 9 all the way, I love me some northern-speaking leather-jacket wearing, can't-dance doctor with no moves and his regen scene still gets me right there (/pounds chest).

Chris Eccleston as a person/actor, on the other hand - at least from what I can tell - is a whole 'nother story. And for the record I'm decidedly not a Tennant fangirl, lol. 

The bottom line is that CE's Prima Donna actions (from all appearances, at least), is just too much. Can you imagine Tennant or Smith acting like that, not wanting to talk about the show in later years, or demanding a certain director, etc., and unwilling (we assume) to be in a 15 second regeneration sequence (that could have been CGI'd easily with Chris' permission)? I really don't see it, not in a million years. In fact Tennant and Smith strike me as the types that would come back (or whatever) whenever needed, even twenty years from now if they were available, and would generally do everything they could to help out the current show and be there for the fans again. When you think of it that way? IMO it makes Eccleston look even worse. I mean, honestly - think about it this way. What if it was a favorite companion refusing to come back? Billie Piper, for instance. Some people would be upset by that, and that can't be blamed on Tennant fangirls.

Murray Gold talked about how pumped Chris was at the beginning of his season, that he was so utterly excited, so I cannot help but wonder if something ... odd ... happened. It's just hard for me to believe that he was that fired up about something only to change his mind so radically, in such a relatively short period of time.

You say that the country has failed to make much progress in terms of nuclear and renewables Fracking keeps us on that teat just long enough to reduce efforts on nuclear and renewables. It reduces the sense of urgency and keeps us sleep-walking for a bit longer.

true,The3rdWorld,eng-essex,Essex,"it seems to me that fracking is a kinda desperate measure but also it's a half-way measure, we're going to suck the last drips of oil from under our feet to supplement our drying up oil wells then thirty years down the line we're going to have nothing to show for it but an icecap free planet!  
  
The fact is we're not that good at fracking yet, it's a baby technology and odds are we're doing it kinda badly - why not have some big scale projects to lower our energy use, to help people solar power their homes and install 12v LED lighting, etc, etc, etc and use this measure to cover the energy gap while we leave that precious-precious hydrocarbon reserve sitting their inflating in value as everyone else wastes their last supplies on low efficiency extraction methods and highly inefficient usages.  
  
Something which is kinda useful to us now to get us out of having to do anything involving too much effort could become absolutely vital to us in the future.  I mean it's easy to dream about wonderful new micro-organisms making oil by the gallon but didn't we learn from fission that sometimes these things are always a decade away?  
  
We need to work with what we've got, we need large scale multinational government projects working on creating effective solutions for home lighting, for heating and for cooking - these alone could slash the energy drain on the grid.  It's not hard either, i use led lights powered by a lead acid battery and PV cells - solar concentrator devices using thermoelectric effect to free hydrogen for cooking or heating could massively slash not just energy use but heating budgets in government buildings and with support in development and rollout of products these technologies could be op and running in widespread use within a few years, this would drastically reduce our hydrocarbon dependence while also maintaining our reserve should it become vital in later decades...

Yeah the billion which was spent on dealing with all the bureaucratic issues of starting fracking for the first time.

It wouldnt be financially suitable to frack if the product wasn't competiative against the worlds other gas supplies.

This sums up what they gave their lives for:

A Western official called that cargo-loading area the âGrand Central station of illicit activitiesâ in Afghanistan.

It is someone from a clearly biased stand point who is an industry which stands to gain a lot from fracking. 

I am no expert, but I am a pedant, and the following points stick out to me in this argument. 

1 - Using the US as an example is wrong. The UK is so much more compact than America. Fracking *will* be happening on peoples doorsteps. Unfortunately, areas that are not on our doorsteps tend to be greenfield sites. We can't build more desperately needed houses but we can do something that is potentially hazardous for short term gain?

2 - Hydrochloric acid is indeed found in the stomach, but I doubt the kindly frackers use it at such weak solutions. Hydrochloric acid is also used in [acid attacks](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/2832769.stm). This is also not the only [harmful contaminant](http://www.hcn.org/issues/43.3/unpacking-health-hazards-in-frackings-chemical-cocktail) in the mix.

3 - Has this government, or the previous on, done *anything* to think of future generations? Don't think it'll start now. Cameron et al would much rather have jam today than jam tomorrow.

Now, I'm not saying whether I think it is a good idea or not, but the OP is presenting a seriously one-sided argument - it isn't even well structured.

Until the government allow a proper debate with researched test cases on both sides, we will not have a way forward. However, money talks, and OP and the oil companies stand to make millions, so I guess that's what they'll do. A few back handers never hurt anyone, did they?

Why would I bring down whole religion in the whole world??? Are you mad? Just because some Muslims are terrorists would I have to bring down whole religion where at least 90% of people within that religion are normal people? The same works for EU. Just because some laws imposed by EU someone regards as unfair, he doesn't have any right to milk that party just because of his personal beliefs. He has a right to fight with it but not by joining them. After all, why would I even try to collapse whole religion to ban wearing bhurka in a country where people don't mind wearing it?

Councils have indeed refused to invest in building new council houses recently, as they would inevitably lose the housing stock to right-to-buy tenants.

What councils have been doing, since right-to-buy, is to give money to local housing associations (I assume not-for-profit ones) to fund their building.

I believe this comes with contractual caveats that the council get to assign tenants to a certain number or percentage of the housing association's properties each year.

In effect this means that councils now never give you a council house unless you're in in emergency need. If you're in emergency need the council put you in a B&amp;B at first, whereas previously they might have retained one or two empty houses for emergency needs.

Before right-to-buy ordinary people could apply for council houses: factory workers, nurses and teachers - anybody, in fact. Now you apply to a housing association who ""asses your priority"" and ""permit a few applications on community and economic grounds"" (i.e. you want to live there).

My mother used to work in emergency housing for two local councils, and in the mid- to late-90s they were actively transferring housing whole estates to housing associations in order to protect them from right-to-buy.

true,pharao007,null,null,"&gt;that's right everything that disagrees with your political view is nationalism, extremism, and/or terrorism, if they win those seats that's what the people in those areas wanted

They are nationalists, most of them. The same applies to BNP and even recent article from the internal UKIP forums said that at least 80% of BNP supporters will most probably join UKIP. I'm sorry, if someone from the party says so, there is something dodgy going on. Cameron wants to reform EU and even quit it if people vote for that. He doesn't behave like a typical nationalist twat, like Farage does. Have you read Farage's manifesto regarding immigrants? Look:

* EU citizens who have been established in the UK for seven years or more will, depending on their circumstances, be able to apply for permanent leave to remain (provided they fulfil certain criteria and are eligible to apply for work permits).*

Do you know what it means? Not hard to guess it means deporting all who have been in UK for less than 7 years but came LEGALLY under EU law. If that's not racist (deporting someone only because of nationality, whatever his situation is in UK and sole fact he came here legally) is fucking VERY wrong.

&gt;sure but using power achieved by the democratic process is not at all like killing people you don't like, and in history it was certainly not done by winning a democratic vote and using the seat as a part of a cynical self serving protest.

All would be fine if at least Farage donated money to charity. At least fucking half of it!!! He makes ""cynical"" protest but uses that money. Would you take free money knowing it came from drug selling? Plenty of people would and wouldn't find any problem with it, no moral compassion. I would probably take... but would donate all of it to a charity helping drug users.

&gt;not very many people do

Not many in percentage. Many in numbers (like whole cities). *The BNP put forward candidates for 338 out of 650 seats for the 2010 general election[148] gaining 563,743 votes*

Funnily, BNP doesn't have ""many"" supporters but when 700k Poles come into UK - FUCKING FLOODS OF IMMIGRANTS. Nice rhetoric.

&gt;well I'm sure a UKIP supporter would say the same about you.

They would probably say so but mainly because they do indeed lack brains. My goals are liberal and not liberal-extreme. UKIP is pretty much far right extreme (not as extreme as BNP though - at least officially). Deporting people just because of their nationality is generally wrong and you have a hint they plan doing so as described above. Supporting BNP is even worse as the party is clearly racist and yes, they would also say the same about me (that I must lack brains) but I'm not against people just because of their origin and because British race is the greatest. Some people should do more reading, for example about Nazis or Apartheid and visit some places (like death camps at Poland) so they could feel to their bones what being far right nationalist person is like.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;Do you have links to UK regulations?

Nothing compact I'm afraid. A lot of the stuff I have to deal with on a day to day basis in my, admittedly, non-fracking role, is contained within the petroleum operator notice system (https://www.gov.uk/oil-and-gas-petroleum-operations-notices). So for instance every time you want to use a chemical you have to check against the PON 15 to see if the government has given you permission to use it, and then to check that you haven't already used the amount they've said you can use (there are numerous safeguards in place to ensure that all I ever see is that it's OK to use the things I have on site, but I check nonetheless as do we all).

&gt;Are these nation-wide or vary by Scotland, Wales, etc?

The DECC currently covers all oil &amp; gas in the UK.

&gt;In the US, in some states, there are literally no regulations on sealing; a driller could do a sealing job with old sneakers and be compliant. This seems to be the biggest flaw with the US approach.

Some US companies are horrific, and I'd never advocate for their sort of oil industry over here. The thing is, it's not just environmental issues some of them are lax on, they're lax on safety too - the two usually go hand in hand. The UK is an entirely different kettle of fish, and detailed plans have to be submitted to the DECC and evaluated before anything is allowed to be done on a well.

&gt;You said ""every cement job in the UK is tested after it is completed to check its integrity"" and my question is whether this testing is required by regulation or something the companies do voluntarily?

It has to be done as it has to be reported. If you didn't do it you'd have to make up numbers, and that would be go to jail type stuff.

&gt;Further, who does the testing (who counts the chickens, the fox or the farmer)?

Well services experts from oil services companies, normally not part of the drilling company.

&gt;Are the results publicly available?

No, but no company would offer up information like that to the public. They have it, and the government has it.

&gt;I'm having trouble believing your indirect claim that the UK has a 100% success rate with sealing.

I'm not sure I actually claimed that, but if you'd like to find me confirmed examples of water contamination due to bad cement jobs then please go ahead. You have to understand, you're talking about three layers of steel, each cemented in place, with each cement job tested by experts before the next move is made. This is not just a bunch of guys chucking some cement made in a building mixer down a hole and hoping it will set.

&gt;What UK regulations and testing standards apply to waste methane?

Currently flaring is allowed, as I understand it. While you may consider this shocking, burning methane to form CO2 is the most environmentally friendly thing to do with non-recoverable methane, next to re-injection, which isn't always viable (although is sometimes done).

&gt;Are drillers required to report leaked gas events (and to whom)?

All leaks and spills have to be directly reported to the operator, and also to the government. Not doing so is go-to-jail stuff.

&gt;How frequently have leakages occurred?

Depends what you mean on leakages, are you including every time a cube of methane comes out of a wellbore and isn't fully burnt off or what? It varies. Needless to say, you read about such things in media such as the Guardian when they happen.

&gt;What air quality monitoring is required by regulation (and are the results publicly available)?

This varies by country in the UK. In Scotland we have SEPA (Scottish EPA) who monitor air quality across the country themselves. So far there haven't been any decreases in air quality raised by any of the UK EPAs.

&gt;What about long term uncertainty? Is there any regulations requiring appropriate insurance coverage for future environmental cleanup costs?

Actually it goes further then that, companies who apply to the government for permission to drill a well of any sort are required to demonstrate that they individually have enough resources to pay for things if anything goes wrong. If they lack the financial power to pay for any mishaps, then they're simply not allowed to drill.

&gt;It's easy enough to structure companies such that when faced with a big environmental bill 10 years from now the company just goes bankrupt (literally the only asset is the wellhead).

The DECC aren't stupid, and suggesting they're just going to miss that the company which is drilling only has a single asset is absurd.

&gt;Given that the rate of sealing failures in the UK is unknown

Provide a source on this claim please.

&gt;how many sealing jobs fail over 10 years? 20 years

Cement jobs are certified in the order of 100's to 1000's of years, not decades.

&gt;When asked about chemicals you answered ""biocides""... which isn't very specific (especially given your strenuously repeated claiming of ""only 3 chemicals""). Can you be more specific about which biocides are permitted?

Actually no, couldn't find any specific information on which biocide the DECC are authorizing.

&gt;To Manolo, my friend and agent , for keeping my feet on the ground and believe in me from the beginning.

&gt;To Rafa Benitez and Pako AyestarÃ¡n, for teaching me to show my best .
&gt;To Luis Aragones, for allowing me to live the dream of every football player, represent his country in a World Cup .

&gt;To all my coaches since academy, for guiding me and believe in my football .  

&gt;To Badalona and S.Gabriel for making me as person ,  to FC. Barcelona for opening me the door , to Valladolid , Tenerife and Toledo for letting establish myself on first division, to Atletico Madrid for making me enjoy a CalderÃ³n Stadium on fire, to R.Santander and Panathinaikos for goods experiences , to Puebla and Pumas for the opportunity to live in a country of warm people and a passionate football, and **to Liverpool FC for making me part of the history of international football and be part of the Red family, forever.**

&gt;To each and every one of the people over 17 years of career that have been with me , have helped me and supported me at every stage I have lived and although not mentioned one by one, I will be forever grateful .
And last but not least, the fans, to all who have followed me over the years , always with good intentions , always encouraging and motivating me every game to be a better player every day.

What you're left with is an energy gap, without many options:

1. Rolling brown outs. 
2. Burn more coal. 
3. Burn locally produced shale gas from fracking.

Sure no one really wants to keep burning hydrocarbons, but shale gas is a lot cleaner than coal... It's also an abundant source of energy for us, and is quite literally on our doorstep... The transport of NG/LNG around the world is a hugely energy intensive operation, not to mention the sensitive geopolitical mess it can land a country in to be reliant on it's next delivery of energy...

Well that's just how economics works... 

There are alternative sources of liquid fuels already (e.g. culturing oleaginous microbes), and some very interesting research going towards the hydrogen economy..

Initially we have 7 top 7 clubs and 13 non-top 7 clubs. So the probability of the first top 7 club that we pick facing a non-top 7 club is 13/19. 13 comes from the number of non-top 7 clubs and 19 is the total number of other clubs.

Assuming that was successful, there are 18 clubs remaining - 6 top 7 and 12 non-top 7. Therefore we get a probability of 12/17. The probability of both of these events taking place is calculated by multiplying the two together - i.e. (13/19)*(12/17).

We repeat this for 7 clubs, getting probabilities of 11/15, 10/13, 9/11, 8/9 and 7/7. Multiplying all of these probabilities together gives 0.1981.

&gt;**Piper Alpha** was a North Sea oil production platform operated by Occidental Petroleum (Caledonia) Ltd. The platform began production in 1976, first as an oil platform and then later converted to gas production. An explosion and the resulting oil and gas fires destroyed it on 6 July 1988, killing 167 men, with only 61 survivors. The death toll includes two crewmen of a rescue vessel. Total insured loss was about Â£1.7 billion (US$3.4 billion). At the time of the disaster, the platform accounted for approximately ten percent of North Sea oil and gas production, and was the worst offshore oil disaster in terms of lives lost and industry impact.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;In regards to the water contamination risk, what is the risk compared to something we non-industry plebs would understand? The chance of winning the lottery jackpot twice? Your boss being hit by lightning?

Hard for me to say as I'm not a statistician, and even if I were there is debate over the risk. It's dangerous to start putting numbers to things without having good evidence for those numbers. I can say that the royal geological survey have described the risk as being ""very"" low, and I can tell you that of the hundreds and hundreds of jobs already done in the UK not a single one has leaked to the environment as a result.

First you have to understand that the majority of jobs aren't happening anywhere near aquifers, then you must take into account the fact that the cement jobs which we're relying in those situations which are done near water, are done and tested at an early stage of the operation, before fracking has been done and before any oil or gas is flowing, so in the event that one is tested and found to be lacking, it can be redone before continuing. Then you've got the fact that you've got, in laymens terms, a straw within a straw within a straw sucking out the oil and gas, but those staws are made of strong steel, and have each individually been tested.

Cement jobs and casings/liners are integral parts of every single well which is created in the UK offshore sector too, it's not something which is unique to fracking, so ironically probably the most controversial part of fracking is actually something which is common to the entire oil and gas industry, and is something the industry has been doing very safely, and routinely, for decades, thousands upon thousands of times.

&gt;Will the number of earthquakes, and subsequent subterranean cracks in the earth affect the stability of the ground? In 50-100 years' time will we end up with sink holes, or the likes?

There's no real risk of this, no. The ""earthquakes"" which lead to the moratorium (which was a great example of the UK behaving sensibly) were not anything a person could feel, they were detected by specialist seismic detectors only.

&gt;It's so hard to find impartial information on fracking, I'm glad you've summed the subject up for us here.

Don't I know it. Obviously there are people in this thread who consider me a shill or think I'm actually some evil team of PR strategists in some dark lair somewhere, but honestly I'm just a guy who is in the industry and thought ""What's all this about then?"", looked into it, building on a foundation of industry knowledge, and came to the conclusion that really, if done sensibly and with good regulation it's not that big a deal and stands to benefit our country a fair old amount.",0,1389698181,null,0,false,0,cep7fw7,t3_1v53hs,t1_cep7fw7,t1_cep6o48,null,1431936125,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

---

&gt;

&gt;**Gastric acid** is a digestive fluid, formed in the stomach. It has a pH of 1-2 and is composed of hydrochloric acid (HCl) (around 0.5%, or 5000 parts per million) as high as 0.1 M, potassium chloride (KCl) and sodium chloride (NaCl). The acid plays a key role in digestion of proteins, by activating digestive enzymes, and making ingested proteins unravel so that digestive enzymes break down the long chains of amino acids.

&gt;Gastric acid is produced by cells lining the stomach, which are coupled to systems to increase acid production when needed. Other cells in the stomach produce bicarbonate, a base, to buffer the fluid, ensuring that it does not become too acidic. These cells also produce mucus, which forms a viscous physical barrier to prevent gastric acid from damaging the stomach. Cells in the beginning of the small intestine, or duodenum, further produce large amounts of bicarbonate to completely neutralize any gastric acid that passes further down into the digestive tract.

&gt;Gastric acid is produced by parietal cells (also called oxyntic cells) in the stomach. Its secretion is a complex and relatively energetically expensive process. Parietal cells contain an extensive secretory network (called canaliculi) from which the gastric acid is secreted into the lumen of the stomach. These cells are part of epithelial fundic glands in the gastric mucosa. The pH of gastric acid is 1.5 to 3.5  in the human stomach lumen, the acidity being maintained by the proton pump H^+/K^+ ...

&gt;

&gt;**Brutalist architecture** is a style of architecture that flourished from the 1950s to the mid-1970s, spawned from the modernist architectural movement. Examples are typically very linear, fortresslike and blockish, often with a predominance of concrete construction. Initially the style came about for government buildings, low-rent housing and shopping centres to create functional structures at a low cost, but eventually designers adopted the look for other uses such as college buildings.

&gt;Critics of the style find it unappealing due to its ""cold"" appearance, projecting an atmosphere of totalitarianism, as well as the association of the buildings with urban decay due to materials weathering poorly in certain climates and the surfaces being prone to vandalism by graffiti. Despite this, the style is appreciated by others, with some of the angular features being softened and updated in buildings currently being constructed in Israel and Latin America, and preservation efforts are taking place in the United Kingdom.

&gt;The English architects Alison and Peter Smithson coined the term in 1953, from the French bÃ©ton brut, or ""raw concrete"", a phrase used by Le Corbusier to describe the poured board-marked concrete with which he constructed many of his post-World War II buildings. The term gained wide currency when the British architectural critic Reyner Banham used it in the title of his 1966 book, The New Brutalism: Ethic or Aesthetic?, to characterise a somewhat recently estab ...

Old coal mines already cause far more than fracking will. Fracking can't cause sink holes, it occurs too deep. Many of the tremors currently felt in the UK is the floors of old mine tunnels poorly backfilled failing. The worst earthquake ever from fracking was a 3.9 which was due to a company in Ohio building a waste water well on a fault line.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;I still have concerns about the actual process - i.e. pumping huge amounts of water and chemicals underground and any potential side effects of this.

What are those concerns? Water is pumped at high pressure until the rock cracks. That's about the sum of the process, it's not actually particularly complicated in the grand scheme of things.

&gt;water itself is a scarce resource, despite the UKs high rainfall. Where does the large amount of water needed for fracking come from? Is this going to impact the quality of our rivers? How effective will the treatment of waste water be before it is released?

The quantities of water required are indeed notable, it's about 6-8 olympic sized swimming pools of water to frack a well. However this well does not need to be potable water, so doesn't have to come from the same water we drink and shower in. You can rest assured that the various EPA's of the UK regularly test water quality in rivers and any changes near frack sites would be dealt with rapidly, however in order for an oil company to be affecting river water quality that would require them to be discharging things into the river, and discharging illegally is one of those ""go to prison for a long time"" things for whomever does it.

&gt;How effective will the treatment of waste water be before it is released?

That depends. Some of the water will stay underground forever, some of it may be treatable using chemicals to bring it back to a safely releasable standard, and some of it may be incinerated to seperate anything we don't want in it from the H2O (water) molecules.

&gt;A 2011 study by the consulting firm Management Information Services, Inc. (MISI) estimated the total historical federal subsidies for various energy sources over the years 1950â2010. The study found that oil, natural gas, and coal received $369 billion, $121 billion, and $104 billion (2010 dollars), respectively, or 70% of total energy subsidies over that period. Oil, natural gas, and coal benefitted most from percentage depletion allowances and other tax-based subsidies, but oil also benefitted heavily from regulatory subsidies such as exemptions from price controls and higher-than-average rates of return allowed on oil pipelines. The MISI report found that non-hydro renewable energy (primarily wind and solar) benefitted from $74 billion in federal subsidies, or 9% of the total, largely in the form of tax policy and direct federal expenditures on research and development (R&amp;D). Nuclear power benefitted from $73 billion in federal subsidies, 9% of the total, largely in the form of R&amp;D, while hydro power received $90 billion in federal subsidies, 12% of the total.

&gt;A 2009 study by the Environmental Law Institute assessed the size and structure of U.S. energy subsidies in 2002â08. The study estimated that subsidies to fossil fuel-based sources totaled about $72 billion over this period and subsidies to renewable fuel sources totaled $29 billion. The study did not assess subsidies supporting nuclear energy.

&gt;The three largest fossil fuel subsidies were:

&gt;Foreign tax credit ($15.3 billion)

&gt;Credit for production of non-conventional fuels ($14.1 billion)

&gt;Oil and Gas exploration and development expensing ($7.1 billion)

&gt;The three largest renewable fuel subsidies were:

&gt;Alcohol Credit for Fuel Excise Tax ($11.6 billion)

&gt;Renewable Electricity Production Credit ($5.2 billion)

&gt;Corn-Based Ethanol ($5.0 billion)

&gt;In the United States, the federal government has paid US$74billion for energy subsidies to support R&amp;D for nuclear power ($50 billion) and fossil fuels ($24 billion) from 1973 to 2003. During this same timeframe, renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency received a total of US$26billion. It has been suggested that a subsidy shift would help to level the playing field and support growing energy sectors, namely solar power, wind power, and biofuels. However, many of the ""subsidies"" available to the oil and gas industries are general business opportunity credits, available to all US businesses (particularly, the foreign tax credit mentioned above). The value of industry-specific subsidies in 2006 was estimated by the Texas State Comptroller to be just $3.06 billion a fraction of the amount claimed by the Environmental Law Institute. The balance of federal subsides, which the comptroller valued at $7.4 billion, came from shared credits and deductions, and oil defense (spending on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, energy infrastructure security, etc.).

&gt;The most important subsidies to the nuclear industry have not involved cash payments. Rather, they have shifted construction costs and operating risks from investors to taxpayers and ratepayers, burdening them with an array of risks including cost overruns, defaults to accidents, and nuclear waste management. This approach has remained remarkably consistent throughout the nuclear industryâs history, and distorts market choices that would otherwise favor less risky energy investments.

&gt;Many energy analysts, such as Clint Wilder, Ron Pernick and Lester Brown, have suggested ...

A bit disingenuous given that you don't specify how much mileage is travelled.

Even if you travel 10 miles a day, 7 days a week, that comes to 48p per mile which is 2.5 times what it costs me. You'd have to travel 25 miles a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to break even with what it costs me per mile.
