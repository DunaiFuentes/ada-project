* Don't go on about how great America is. We definitely don't want to hear about July the 4th or Thanksgiving Day.

* Forget whatever part of Europe your ancestors are from. No one will care that you are 1/128th Irish.

* Manners above all. Thank people for everything, even if they can't do something for you thank them for hearing you out or if they fail , thank them for trying. Apologise for everything. It will help you avoid awkward interactions. For example someone stands on the back of your shoe. Both of you should say sorry and be on your way.

Chinese teams practice a lot - they get disciplined due to that practice. - You go ask a UK team to practice 5 hours a day. You'll get ""Fuck off, too busy watching football"" or some shit.

The level of skill from players in UK, while it's there. And there are quite a bit of unnoticed talent. But you pretty much have to be in the crowd of the known UK teams to get picked up by a good UK team. Easily some 5-6k unknown UK players here.

Though, saying all that. I'll probably try and make a UK team after TI if I can find players with the same dedication and the drive to improve and win. - I'm relatively unknown, but maybe UK scene just needs new blood and a fresh start.

Nice to see McQueen get a goal, will be interesting to see how he develops, although he needs to shave, because he is growing another Lallana beard. Which isn't good on anyone.

Only a handful of names are starters ""every game"" for Chelsea: Courtois/ Cech, Hazard, Terry, Azpilicueta, and Matic. Everyone else is interchangeable depending on the opposition, and I don't think anyone is more suited to make that decision than Jose. 

All of Schurrle's qualities make him an excellent candidate for a late game substitution, so it makes sense the relatively uninformed public and/or troll/click bait that is Bleacher Report would think that. 

Essentially, Chelsea have enough quality that Schurrle isn't guaranteed a weekly spot in the starting XI. He is a very exciting player though, and I'm happy he plays for the team I support.

Liverpool shouldn't fear them. Hell, Newcastle shouldn't fear them.

Even losing Suárez, we've definitely improved already with this window. Think about who our bench was during the Chelsea game at Anfield: we brought on an injured Danny Sturridge, and Iago Aspas (whom we really like, but still...) While Chelsea brought on £80m of Willian and Torres. We still need a pair of quality fullbacks before I'll settle down though. Coutinho and Sterling are going to be monstrous this season. Henderson and Lallana will choke teams to death in midfield, easing some of the pressure on the defence. Stevie is still going to be the captain. Studge proved during the Suárez ban that he has what it takes to provide the goal threat on his own. 

The Suárez sale is a loss, but look at what happened to Tottenham. 3 fewer points in a season which included three managers and an overhaul of the first team. We're going to do just fine.

true,CageChicane,lfc12,,"I think Arsenal will win the title. I know they always choke, but that had to be blamed on injuries last year. Their back 4 really was great last year until they played us. Added Debuchy to that group as well. Ozil should be improved as far as knowing the league and he'll have a lot more support assuming their stars stay in one piece longer than last year.

Chelsea will be defensive and consistent. They've done well to improve with signings, but we'll see how they play together.

City looks great on paper, but they seem like an entitled bunch and I am expecting a hangover effort in the league while they focus on CL.

It has to be between us and Utd as the odd one out. We have to be favored for a host of reasons: better attacking players, better squad, stability at manager, not having to deal with transition (again).

&gt;___Being Human___ is a British [supernatural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural) [drama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama) television series. It was created and written by [Toby Whithouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toby_Whithouse) for broadcast on [BBC Three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Three).  The show blends elements of [flatshare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roommate) comedy and horror drama. It originally starred [Lenora Crichlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenora_Crichlow) as [Annie Sawyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Sawyer) (a [ghost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost)), [Russell Tovey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Tovey) as [George Sands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Sands) (a [werewolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewolf)) and [Aidan Turner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aidan_Turner) as [John Mitchell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_(Being_Human\)) (a [vampire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire)) — all of whom were sharing accommodation and attempting as best as they can to live a ""normal"" life and blend in with the ordinary humans around them. In the third series, [Sinead Keenan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinead_Keenan) became part of the main cast as [Nina Pickering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Pickering) (a werewolf). In the fourth series the ensemble was joined by [Michael Socha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Socha) as [Tom McNair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Being_Human_characters#Tom_McNair) (a werewolf) and [Damien Molony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damien_Molony) as [Hal Yorke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Being_Human_characters#Hal_Yorke) (a vampire).  The fifth series added [Kate Bracken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Bracken) as [Alex Millar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Being_Human_characters#Alex_Millar) (a ghost).  The first two seasons were set in [Totterdown, Bristol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totterdown,_Bristol), and the third season onwards relocated to [Barry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry,_Vale_of_Glamorgan), Wales.

They didn't call you a criminal, but they enforced a contractual term that you had agreed to in advance.

&gt;It will be on Wednesday when Montero undergoes a medical to confirm that his fitness it optimum for transfer.

&gt;Montero would become another multi-million dollar transfer in this summer window for Mexican football [*ed: It wasn't talking about a massive signing on fee for the player*], after his compatriot Enner Valencia was sold to West Ham in England for about $20million.


&gt;Morelia will earn more than six million dollars from the sale of the Ecuadorian winger, according to reports in the British press. Montero caught the attention of European clubs after his performance in the World Cup Brazil 2014, even though his team was unable to overcome the group stage.

&gt;So far, several Ecuadorian players have migrated to the best leagues in the world, while another, Michael Arroyo, was announced as the new signing for Águilas de América for next season.

They won't play Lukaku, Courtois isn't an upgrade on what they had, Fabregas is a weird one doesn't seem like a Mourinho player, I want to say Costa will be shit but, meh, I'm not sure we'll see. Chelsea is the strikers graveyard.

&gt;Arsenal got our Sanchez, and Ramsey and Walcott are back from their injuries.

It's always injuries with them though isn't it? No coincidence. Also there's something not right with Wengers teams lately, I can't put my finger on it but I doubt they will win anything again.

&gt;Tottenham are not worth mentioning. With a decent manager, and their players getting used to playing with each other, they might play a little better than last year.

I really rate Pochettino, I think they will surprise everyone.

&gt;Everton lost Lukaku.

Meh, seventh for them.

&gt;Scum~~s~~ seem to be on their way to get Vidal, and they have van Gaal as a manager now. Despite what a dick he is, he seems to know his strategies well and was one of the best managers during the World Cup. They've also picked up the young Luke Shaw and Herrera.

If they don't get top four they are in deeper than they know and I don't think they will. Herrera is an improvement but not by much, Shaw is a step back for the current season although obviously will do better in time.

Physics at GCSE has little/no scope to prepare people for a career in physics, and leaves people generally clueless as to why they should be interested in the subject and persue it in the future.

Other full on trials bikes from different manufacturers would be in similar weight bracket so something around 130Kg is going to be more intended as a dual purpose bike but I am sure would suit a lot of people fine.

* We don't vote for individuals who are part of a group of people with more or less the same views (a Party). We vote for the Party. Therefore the elected member is expected to vote with his party and not with his constituents (even when they express their utter contempt for a decision).

2. The expansion of free schools - which worked well in Sweden for a little bit but now more and more evidence is gathering that shows they cost more and deliver lower standards of education. 

3. Revising of curriculum to be more ""knowledge based"" instead of ""intellectual skills"" based such as analysis and evaluation.  Ask any educator and they will tell you this is not good.

4. Removal of 'contextual value added' as a measure of school performance - CVA takes into account the background of pupils when working out how well they should do on average. This has resulted in schools in poorer tougher areas being closed.

5. Devaluation of teachers - more teachers are leaving the profession now. The effects of this won't show for a while but one of the strong points about the previous labour government was how many new and good quality teachers they got to join the profession. Which in turn pushed up standards. 

6. Concentration of power - a considerable number of powers which used to be in the hands of headteachers, governors and LEAs now have been shifted to the Secretary of education.

Despite saying that though, I'd still say we have to focus on getting forwards in first. Play to our strengths. With Markovic, Lallana (kinda a forward) and Lambert (depth) that's a pretty great start to retaining a good attack. Of course one marque signing would be great, but I doubt we'd get one. I'm just hoping for someone in their prime, but they don't have to be a world beater, to give Markovic and Sterling time to develop.

I'd say if we get one more winger; Moreno or another good, young LB; a proven RB in their prime and another CB, preferably Lovren then we can definitely have a really good shout for top 4, maybe even the league, but that's obviously not going to come easy.

Honestly, I think him, along with all the other Southampton players (Shaw, Lovren, Schneiderlin, Rodriguez, Lambert) vary from decent to good in their abilities.

To be honest, I think the Southampton boys are slightly overrated by many in the PL since they are a small club that managed to play attractive footy. They performed well for a small team but that's about it. Let's not overlook the fact that all of these players ended up in the 8th spot, and even then, much of that credit is due to Mauricio Pochettino's ability as a manager. 

I dunno, I just feel that with Lallana we've once again fallen into the trap of buying overpriced British talent who will turn out to be good at best and will never be able to live up to their price tags (i.e., Allen, Downing, Adam, Carroll). 

The Sturridge purchase, on the other hand, I was more than fine with since he had shown consistently the potential he had and he was a relatively cheap buy for us.

Totally agree.  I've always thought we're a rather nice bunch of people in Guildford.  I'm sure we have our fair share of bigots, but they seem to keep themselves well hidden most of the time.

In this case there was an orchestrated campaign by a religious group (now that I think of it, it could have been a national campaign rather than a local group) trying to encourage people to write to her and urge her not to support gay marriage.  I'm guessing it fired up enough people to sway the balance.

I don't know how many letters she got, but if it was, say, 90 against and 10 for, then it's easy for her to say there's strong support against.  The sad thing is that those 100 people (or however many it was) who cared enough about the issue to write were the ones who got to shape her decision making process.  The vast majority of people (who I'm sure are quite reasonable) didn't care enough about it to do anything so their voices weren't heard.

The government can't open a factory, or tell a company to move its HQ there...

You need infrastructure before jobs can be created, £80m doesn't buy you an awful lot of infrastructure.  And this is before the skills base is considered, could you realistically open a software development lab there and find the staff? or could you find skilled technicians to build machines there, or even the engineering resource to run such facilities?

I think we need to invest in our motorway and rail network with deep integration with the south to encourage factories and other such businesses to set up shop in that part of the country.  with manufacturing facilities comes people who want to move up the chain from production staff to skilled engineers which will further increase the value of the area for other companies to invest in.

This is where and you and I disagree. I want Chelsea Football Club to succed, you seem to only want Torres.

Otherwise he would have been gone a *long* time ago.

Alright calm down now..you have gone off the deep end. Were there not 10 other players that are were on this team?  Or is the only player you see or care about on the pitch Torres?

You are exactly the type of fan that I dislike. You like one player more than the club. Chelsea would be better off without Torres, its as simple as that. 

 &gt; If you don't like him, then dude, go support liverpool

This proves exactly what I thought. You think Torres = Chelsea. Embarrassing. Were you even a supporter before we bought him? Didn't think so.

If you think he even comes close to being a proper striker then you were not around when we had the likes of Anelka, Didier in his prime, Gudjohnsen etc.. Torres isn't even a shadow of these guys.

His every policy was a hint that the problems in education lay solely with the teachers.

I genuinely like what I do and believe I have a skill that a huge many people don't. Spending my whole day getting teenagers to sit down and learn maths requires a charisma that not everyone can do and some will never be able to do. A majority of people in the profession are slightly trodden on by their pupils and don't have enough to back them up. They are beginning to crack and will leave the profession soon as there is not enough incentive to be put through that stress. I observed a teacher a few weeks ago, and I want you to imagine doing this day in and day out.

No children were listening to anything she was saying and every time she got close to some control this little dickhead in the second row would shout ""Fish!"" in a weird accent to raucous laughter. In the end I had to step in and she was in floods of tears when the children left. 

Can you imagine going through that 5-6 times a day? That's what happens when you don't quite have the level of aggression and charisma to keep the children in check which most people don't. I know that lady would rather work a less stressful job for less money. 

It needs to have more incentives not to satisfy some evil greed you all believe teachers have but to attract confident competent individuals. It doesn't need to be money by the way, it could be an increased budget to reduce class size, it could be some extra service to punish or help children's needs.

As the recession ends and the half competent leave to be replaced by the incompetent it will become an accepted thing that the teachers are rubbish and what we need to do is train them more. Good luck. I will jump ship when the last of the respect for my profession has left, no point in working this hard to be hated and not particularly well off. At least lawyers who may be hated can dry their tears with bank notes.

On current ability he is a direct upgrade on Coutinho. They play a similar role in the team, but Lallana has goal scoring in his locker. 

Coutinho clearly has more potential and a higher ceiling, and being so young will eventually (likely) become much better than Lallana. But while we wait for him to develop we now have AL to step up and bring the team to the next level. 

By the time Coutinho reaches his full potential, Lallana will be winding down and probably phased out of the starting XI. 

Another way to look at it: we've essentially duplicated Coutinho by signing AL. He'll do just as well as Phil in that pressing midfield role and take much of the pressure off him, allowing him to develop.

The best development, in my opinion, comes from minutes on the pitch. Having Coutinho on the bench and playing against clubs from our cup competitions won't do him any good. Why hold out on getting the best from Coutinho in 3-4 years when Lallana is winding down when we could be getting the best out of him in 2-3 years or even 1-2 years? Plus, I don't see Lallana's contribution as THAT much more significant than Coutinho's. 

Coutinho has seen his potential and knows what he is capable. If he's not getting the minutes he feels he needs and deserves, especially with him really trying to get into the Brazil team, I'm afraid he'll start looking for somewhere else to take his talent and develop.

In summary, I just don't think buying Lallana and having him replace Coutinho is worth it, since it could slow the progression of Coutinho's development or could encourage him to look for other teams.",0,1405465688,null,0,false,0,ciyhni4,t3_2as9pw,t1_ciyhni4,t1_ciyhbqh,null,1434734023,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Leicester to Birmingham New Street and Birmingham Moor Street to Warwick or something.  Maybe even a three way split, Leicester - Birmingham, Birmingham - Solihull, Solihull  - Warwick.  That would take advantage of subsidised fares within the West Midlands. 

**edit**

I've half arsed it (ie, double check this yourself), but splitting at Solihull could save a bit.  Leicester - Warwick is £29.90.    Leicester - Solihull is £13.00 (the same prices as Leicester - Birmingham!) and Solihull - Warwick is £5.40 which brings the total to £18.40 for a day return.  

You will have to travel via Solihull rather than via Coventry, but you would almost certainly be doing this anyway as it is faster and involves fewer changes. The main reason people go via Coventry is to avoid a cross Birmingham transfer because the trains via Coventry leave from New Street where the Leicester trains arrive. Trains via Solihull go from Moor Street station.   The walk from New Street to Moor Street is barely 500 yards and very easy unless you are in a wheelchair or lugging suitcases or something.  All trains from Birmingham to Warwick will stop at Solihull so your tickets will be valid. You do not need to get off the train at Solihull.  You might be able to pinch a few more pennies if you split at Dorridge instead but this would limit the trains you can catch and make it not worth it in my opinion. 

**edit #2** 

You may or may not be aware but there are a few stations in the Warwick area.   There is Warwick, which is in the town centre and Warwick Parkway which is basically a car park on the A46 and it's there for people wanting to get out of Warwick rather than those who want to visit the town.  Don't get off there unless you fancy a taxi ride to finish your journey.  Probably also worth mentioning Leamington Spa is very close too. You can walk from Leamington station into Warwick town centre in about 40 minutes.  Leamington and Warwick merged into each other years ago and for all intents and purposes are one large town these days.  Leamington is lovely if you were unaware, it is an old spa town with a genuinely beautiful shopping street (""the parade"") but it doesn't have a castle or a racecourse.

true,the_jacksown,cnty-uk,"Nottingham ","I just skimmed it and to me it seems to do little more than restate and slightly amend the law which gave the government these surveillance powers in the first place: the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) 2000, specifically [s.5](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/23/section/5), which deals with the grounds for issuing a warrant, and [s.22](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/23/section/22) which deals with the power to obtain data.

DRIP s. 3 changes RIPA s. 5(3)(c) and s. 22(2)(c) - which both provide definitions of 'necessity' either to issue a warrant or to obtain data, respectively, by adding a qualifier that the Secretary of State needs to deem the circumstances relevant to national security. To me this seems to be more restrictive, rather than broadening their powers. 

Section 4 of DRIP basically extends the scope of RIPA to make them enforceable against persons who are outside of the United Kingdom.

Also, DRIP contains a clause saying that it will be automatically repealed on 31 December 2016: s. 6(3).

The DRIP bill is very short, only about 10 pages, you can find a PDF of it [here](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2014-2015/0073/15073.pdf) and take a look at it for yourself. 

Overall, I feel like the media are sensationalising this issue a great deal. These powers to surveil UK citizens have existed at least since 2000, the only thing that's changing is that the Government are changing the statutory authority for its basis. Whereas before they could rely on EU law (specifically Directive 2006/24/EC) the ECJ decision (which was in April - begging the question why this is only now an 'emergency') has struck down this authority, so it seems to be a move by Parliament to make sure they are complying with European law by enforcing a domestic act of legislation rather than an EU directive. 

This is just what I got from reading the Bill so I could be way off but that's how I understand it.

With HB capping, landlords have the option of realising that they were taking the piss a bit, realising that they are not going to get a new tenant to pay the same rate, so dropping the rate to something the tenant can afford. I gather this has been happening in some places, as a pragmatic measure.

With the bedroom tax, if the landlord knocks 14% of your rent to try to keep you as a tenant, I'm guessing your HB goes down and you still don't have enough to pay the rent?

true,FezojT,null,null,"Physics student here, I'd just like some elaboration on:

&gt;In a summary, physics at pre-A level is based on ""things are this way"", and not ""this is why things are this way"". People who are taking further GCSE maths, or are heading for the top tier GCSE grade in math, would have no issue dealing with the mathematics behind most physics concepts taught between 13-16.

I'm not sure if you're just setting the scene for the comment(s) you go on to make or if this is a complaint in itself. I have just completed my third year studying physics (the only reason I remain a student is because I am on a master's course) and it still is this way a lot of the time. Nowhere near as much, I can derive a decent number of the things I've encountered from basic principles, but the truth is that you can't really condense 2000 years of scientific progress into 4. I think for the most part GCSE has to be a lot of swallowing what you're told as a broad introduction to the subject. I do think a good effort was made at GCSE to instill an appreciation and understanding of the scientific method though, which is probably more important at the early stage. 

&gt;At A-Level you're then dropped into the mathematics side of physics with almost no preparation, and far less time to get to grips with it and actually pass the course.

It follows on pretty well from GCSE as I remember. There is more emphasis on physics as a subject based on quantitative models, but generally it isn't the maths people struggle with, it's the physical intuition behind applying it. All you really need to do (for the AS level at least) is be able to rearrange an equation; most trip up on identifying the correct approach to solving the problem, identifying the relevant parameters etc. Granted at A2 there are some slightly more tricky concepts, like logarithms, but not many and very manageable. There is no requirement for calculus, statistics, differential equations etc. until degree level. 

&gt;Physics at GCSE has little/no scope to prepare people for a career in physics, and leaves people generally clueless as to why they should be interested in the subject and persue it in the future.

I doubt any GCSE course does. If it's taught well then some students will have an interest in it and some will hate it. I hated English literature, and almost every English Lit. student I've spoken to hated physics. GCSE serves as a broad introduction to a topic and an opportunity to get some understanding of what science is, why it is important and what topical issues in science are. For people like me, it was good enough to prepare me to go on and study it at a higher level. For others it gives an indication of what a scientific test looks like (and hopefully allows them to poke holes in tabloid newspapers' reporting of dubious studies), the dangers of electricity, why global warming appears in the news so much and other pieces of topics that go together as part of a well-rounded education. 

&gt; There's also a pretty clear failing at some point given that only 20% of students who pursue it are women, whereas the other sciences and maths are much closer to 50/50.

There's also a disparity in the opposite direction on social sciences and languages courses, though for some reason this is never flagged up as a problem. I'm sure there are many reasons for this, and I doubt it's rooted in the way it is taught at GCSE. For example, it could be that males tend to on average have a higher degree of spatial intelligence than women, or it could be due to the culture we have grown up in; male toys put more emphasis on construction (things like meccano) and mechanical objects (toy cars, guns) and female toys place more emphasis on more emotional pursuits (toy dolls) or just different skill sets (toy kitchen sets etc.). Women have the same opportunities to study physics as men, but they are choosing not to, and the only logical reason for that is that it's something that they just don't enjoy; it's something that doesn't resonate with a stereotypical female brain, whether that is defined by genetics or upbringing.

true,Kohenlevite,null,null,"Speaking as a Jew I can contribute to Israels foundation. I'm not familiar with northern Ireland history but I have heard about the Israel and Palestine flags in Belfast so I assume part of it has to do with a shared identity of struggle or perception.

Israel before it existed was part of the ottoman empire , there was no historical Palestinian nation at that time, but there were some people living there like Armenians, Greeks, some Jews, Bedouin Arabs, etc. The land on ottoman maps at least from 1875 and before indicate the region was part of the greater part of ottoman Syria and used a unique system for land distribution at the time.

Jews were immigrating in small religious waves mainly from Yemen and some parts of north Africa throughout the 1500s and on. The main aliyah or immigration movements started in 1870 with a large scale Yemenite immigration and then that was follows with immigration from Ashkenazi Jews from eastern and central Europe under Theodore Herzl which wanted to set up agricultural settlements , this occurred throughout the 1880s 1890s all the way up to 1920. The ottoman maps indicate around 1900 there was a region called Palestine but it reflects the Negev desert and not the current areas that Arabs claim. 

During this period Jews bought tracts of land from the ottoman empire and Arab landowners , including property in modern west bank, some of the so called illegal settlements like gush etzion were bought in the 1920s before the part it on of a Arab state and was deemed illegal after the un made that land Arab land.

Due to large scale attacks on Jewish agricultural settlements Jews formed groups like lehi irgun and haganah to defend those settlements and at some point the Europeans started to colonize those lands, this is why if you look at the history of Syria or Egypt or Iraq or even Lebanon, they are recent countries. The British created the British mandate of Palestine in 1920 which lasted until 1948 and originally it seems the British were pro Israel and in support of a Jewish state, at some point this changed as the Brits were involved in ww2 and didnt want a full scale war against the Arabs, immigration slowed and it wasn't until the British left that the league of nation partitioned the land between Jews and Arabs, many Jewish settlements were now in Arab territory and the Arabs refused to recognize Israel, they esentially cleansed Jewish villages and so the Jews fought against their neighbors as they were invaded. What was to become Palestine was occupied by Egypt and Jordan, Jordan destroyed 55 synagogues in west bank, ancient ones , they uprooted cemetaries which there is still evidence of the hebrew marks to this day and made the west bank free of Jews.

No one complained when Jordan occupied the region, during 67 Egypt Syria and Jordan tried to invade Israel again and they lost, so Israel annexed Golan heights, Sinai and east Jerusalem, Jordan have up their claims and renounced citizenship to their own people. As Israel never annexed the land of west bank and Gaza, the Un assumed that this territory was now Palestinian while declaring all Jews and Jewish settlements regardless if it predated Palestine to be illegal.

The main issues is that the Arabs rejected their partition and became selfish, they wanted the entire land for themselves including legally purchased Jewish land, they also didn't want the majority Jewish population there and stated when the British left they would deport most of the Jews, the Arabs clearly wanted Jews to be 2nd class citizens as dhimmis paying taxes as non Muslims in the land, if you look at the hamad flag they don't even recognize Israel and believe all Jews should be expelled. Israel on the other hand had 20 percent Arabs in the knesset and in the military with full rights.

I then took the number of times each word identified was used over the last year per subreddit and divided them by the subreddit populations (which I gathered by going to the subreddits in question and adding their populations to the formula.) The bar was then colorized proportionally based on which words contributed to the total amount of swearing used.

My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to trust in my graphing program.

If you want to see what the top 1,000 or so words were, per subreddit, I have created word clouds for each subreddit. I also made lists for every [MLB](http://imgur.com/gallery/4k2hx), [EPL](http://www.reddit.com/r/PremierLeague/comments/26ug28/rpremierleague_and_every_team_subreddits_most/), [NHL](http://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/2718tj/rhockey_and_all_team_subreddits_most_used_words/), [NBA](http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/27c143/rnba_and_nba_team_subreddits_most_used_words_for/), and [NFL](http://imgur.com/a/oIqbn) team subreddit for their last respective seasons. I will be repeating my efforts with this list to get an idea of the most (and least) foul-mouthed sports fans.

The last time Essien played full time for Chelsea was 2010-2011. That is now 4 years ago, he played 33 League games with 3 goals. Even around that year he was not playing a massive amount of games. 

2008-2009 was 11 league games, 2009-2010 was 14 league games. 

His last real year at Chelsea as a real backup option was 2011-2012, he played 14 games and scored 0 goals. 

I would say for the role he played, that Ramires is the most likely to point at as being his replacement, with more pace and dribbling ability than Essien, but less of a destroyer. 

Essien at his prime was a good player 2005-2008, but not really someone that we need to replace. We have been without his prime for a very long time now.

There is little reason you'd ever want to launch a rocket from anywhere except the equator if your goal is to get something into orbit, because nearly all the satellite orbits we find most useful are either equatorial (meaning that if you launch them from a near-equatorial region you use the least amount of fuel / or have a greater possable payload) or polar (it doesn't matter at all where you launch them from), there are a few ""inclined orbits"" (somewhere half-way between the two) that would actually be more efficient because of our latitude, such as the [Molniya orbit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molniya_orbit), but I think the uses for that orbit these days are only scientific, you wouldn't put a modern communications satellite in that orbit today because it would be ""out of service"" 90% of it's time.

I dunno, I quite like that someone still has the whole ""great British engineering optimism"" thing going, but until Skylon actually tests an engine I'm just going to assume that *if* it happens it'll be 3-4 years late and the first decade will be spent sending millionaires up to 300,000ft.

true,Aygers,lfc99,,"The thing to note here, is that seven of those transfers, have not worked out, thus far. Included, in the ones that have not worked so far, is Luis Alberto. Excluded are Ilori, Kolo and the four latest signings. Depending on how these latest players, Rodgers has recruited, work out, will be key to our next season. We need three of the four guys, who are in so far, to have good debut seasons for Liverpool. 

I have faith, that the new players will do well, especially Lallana and Lambert, as they are experienced, not only in the Premier League, but lower leagues as well. That sort of proven quality should stand them well, when they'll be on the pitch for our team. It's tough to expect much from Marković and Can, as they lack experience, not only in the Premier League (although Marković has proven himself in the campaigns he's played so far, we have to acknowledge, that moving to the Premier League is a big step for any player). The key, for Rodgers in the next season, might very well be to figure out which player to use in which competition. I also have full faith, that Kolo can deliver a solid season and that Ilori will improve, to become an important player for Liverpool. 

I opted for ""did not work out"" on Alberto, because he's had a fair bit of opportunity in the 13/14 season and it really did not work out for him. Could have just as easily put Ilori in the ""did not work out"" category in all honesty. Going forward, in this transfer window, we need more first team players. Liverpool has plenty of youth and promise at the club, now we seem to be in need of players, who can walk into our starting eleven. Those players will be tough to find, even more so, when you consider the positions we will be recruiting for. Right now, I expect BR to add a striker, an attacking midfielder who can also play on the wing and a full back. Potentially, we need another goalkeeper as well, two senior GKs are not enough, for as tough a season as Liverpool are about to start.

All in all, the current transfer window will go a long way, toward telling us, how good Brendan Rodgers is at using the transfer market, to improve his team. He's done an excellent job, preparing the team and leading them through games and seasons. It's really starting to look though, that this summer will show us, how good of an operator he is in the transfer market.",1,1405469851,null,0,1405470121,0,ciyjm1m,t3_2at3tf,t1_ciyjm1m,t3_2at3tf,null,1434734962,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

I think the easiest criticism of using a UK spaceport for polar orbits is that we have no inherent advantage over any other place on earth in physical/geographical terms, and if you want to do polar orbits then you're mostly competing on launch vehicle cost-to-orbit and the cost of the infrastructure that supports that capability.

Not that Musk's competition rules anything out, but he'll probably be well into the concept of **reusing** rockets that launch actual commercial payloads before our spaceport even gets built.

One big signing doesn't always work out. Lets assume:

* ""big signing"" = £20m+
* ""medium signing"" =  £10m - £20m
* ""smaller signing"" = &lt;£10m

Last summer we had two big name signings. Soldado and Lamela and, honeslty, neither one of them panned out - at least not for that season. I hope we keep both as I feel they'll both have much better years - but as far as last season goes, they were both dud transfers.

For medium signings - we had Paulinho and Eriksen who, objectively, both had much better seasons, with Eriksen being the best of the bunch.

For smaller signings - we had Chadli, Capoue, and Chiriches. None were impact players, save for Chiriches who was oft-injured and fell out of favor with Timmy.

So, no. We can't, and shouldn't, put all of our eggs in one ""big name"" player's basket. 

The only exception I would want to make for that is if it was a big name player that had more than a few years PL experience and was still young, for example someone like ~~Gareth Bale~~ Adam Lallana. He's a ""big name"" player (£25 million) and he has loads of PL experience. He's already been sold, so that's out, but players of similar caliber should definitely be the only players we pursue at that kind of money.

Otherwise, what we ***should*** do is use that £50 million and invest it in three players in the £15m-£17m range, addressing all of our needs areas such as LB, CB, and maybe up front to add depth.

It's also important to remember that, without CL football, its unlikely that anyone worth ~£30m+ is going to want to come to spurs when, surely, there is a CL club somewhere that wants their services as well.",0,1405476957,null,0,false,0,ciymydi,t3_2asorx,t1_ciymydi,t3_2asorx,null,1434736574,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

More seriously I agree. I think fullbacks are very hard to spend money on and be seen as value for money. Most of the time when a new one comes in at any club they seen to have an exiting early performance early but after a season people are wondering if they are good enough. fullbacks face the trickiest players in the comp and have to work hard all game up and down the field. To be honest whoever is our LB they will get mugged a few times in the season and caught too far up the pitch and I doubt a 15m signing will do much better than what we produce. Flanno, Wisdom, Kelly are all decent players and free.

**They should just get a warrant... then collect the target's data.**  

Not collect the data (via proxy) then get a warrant to make ""looking at"" the data legal.  It's a ""big deal"". 

We all want targeted surveillance to work. But if you collect all our data... practically anyone can get it, it's already been collected. History shows that we should never trust a government with access to all that data either. Go to court, get a warrant first.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Obviously MPs receive such a large quantity of letters it would be impractical, nay impossible to provide a personal response to all of them. Like any large organisation they use customer relationship management systems to deal with letters and emails, which work roughly as follows:

* letter or email is sent
* letter or email is read by member of the MP's parliament/constituency office team
* office team use CRM software to note the topic of the letter and produce a template response (written by the MP originally), editing where necessary
* MP looks at letters/email prints and approves them
*letters and emails are sent

Often the template response requires referring the issue to a relevant minister's office etc., where the same thing will occur until a meaningful response reaches back down the line.

When lots of people write in about a topic, the CRM system aggregates that so parties/MPs know what concerns people the most, and so on.

My guess is that your MP doesn't have very good assistants if they don't personalise the response, or that they're swamped by the number of letters and simply don't have the time to reply personally (bear in mind MPs usually have a few people at most working for them, and those people are mostly busy with research and media stuff).

If you want a personal response to your MP I recommend going to their surgeries.

But feel free to think your MP is a cunt because they glanced at your letter and approved a generic response that wouldn't get them fired (yay, whips...) over an issue that's of, unfortunately, marginal consideration!

All I can say is that from the matches I've watched of his (granted I only watched maybe 6-8 Benfica matches last season all in the Europa. League), he always seemed to stand out as the best player on the pitch. Perhaps it was his continued insistence on running straight at defenders, or his passing, but he always seemed to stand out in every game I watched. Obviously, that's just a subjective take on him though and you may have seen it differently. But when he was targeted, many respected people in the game (scouts, reporters, pundits, etc), came out and repeated things that I'd thought previously. Many call him one of the best young talents in the game.

I guess the only thing to does trawl the internet looking for opinions on him from people in the game who you respect. Or try and watch more videos.

It's a breakdown in the coalitions ability to actually do anything, something that was announced months ago, that has caused the bill to be delayed. 

By delaying actual discussion till 2016 there will be another government in power, possibly another coalition, whose terms will be different actually enabling them to properly debate things. Three months is not a lot of time to come up with a large piece of important legislation, especially when the two ruling parts of government cannot agree on anything. Forcing through a piece of legislation that doesn't change anything is far easier and frankly safer. 

Basically it comes down to politics and the incompatibility of the coalition government rather than some nefarious government plot. Considering we've had the exact same law for the last 14 years another 2 years is not a big deal, especially when it means we'll have an actual real debate about it when the current legislation expires.

I haven't been impressed with their service, to be honest. Of the 6 or more agencies I've worked with thus far, Chancellors has maybe been the best overall. Their agents have been consistent in their interactions and have seemed to pay attention to what I've been saying. 

On the other hand, every time I contact finders keepers they usually say something along the lines of ""Sorry, this property is unavailable because [insert reason here], but if you could please answer the following questions we'll register your details in our database."" Most of the questions are good ones, so I'll give them that. But I keep getting the same request from them to answer the same set of questions, so obviously there is no central database with my details in it, or if there is no one is checking it. 

I also get weekly property lists from them. However, I'm pretty sure it is just an automated mailing list that mails out properties indiscriminately (budget criteria aside). And when they do send me properties that are supposed hand-picked they're never pet-friendly; this is in spite of me having asked to be sent pet-friendly properties only. All they seem to pay attention to is my budget range and my requested number of bedrooms.

true,kopking08,null,null,"I'm not saying I want that. My original points were frankly that I thought Enrique and Flanno were good enough for now if there were no obvious upgrades.

There's no way a club that isn't City or Chelsea is going to be able to afford having a like for like replacement on the bench (or, really, not even making the bench!). 

If you look at clubs in our bracket of financial success, they have their starting fullbacks and then they have younger backups in those positions who, sometimes, might be pushing for the starting job. 

Arsenal let Sagna go to sign Debuchy and that's not an obvious upgrade (my best friend's an Arsenal fan and he doesn't understand the signing at all). They didn't keep Sagna around. Their starting fullbacks will be Debuchy and at LB it's basically a toss between Gibbs or Monreal (with Gibbs the most likely). But at RB they have no one any better than Flanno or Kelly or Wisdom. At LB you could easily argue that Johnson could play just as well as a backup as either of Arsenal's LBs. 

Same goes for Tottenham. Same goes for Man Utd. Same goes for Everton. 


Enrique is in the position of being too good for the bench but, it is clear in Rodgers eyes, not good enough to start. 

I agree with anyone who says Johnson is too expensive to just sit on the bench. But are there any CL experienced fullbacks who can play both RB and LB available for a transfer fee and wages that would be less than Johnson over the next year?

I doubt it. So we keep him because we keep him. But I doubt we'll hang on to Enrique if we sign someone.

Hence..........my original point that we should only sign someone if they're an obvious upgrade. Only Moreno is that (and I think, even there, it's only arguably).",0,1405481566,null,0,false,0,ciyp2y2,t3_2atji4,t1_ciyp2y2,t1_ciyn3zh,null,1434737418,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0

Your comment was that you would have picked Willian over Oscar based on his season with Chelsea. 

I pointed out that Oscar had 3x the goals Willian did last season, while playing more of a link role than Willian. 

You countered saying Oscar only had 2 assists, I point out that Willian ALSO only had 2 assists. 

By pointing out that fact, I sound like an idiot ?

So your argument was Willian was better than Oscar, even though he got less goals, while getting the same assists, in a more attacking role, with Willian being 3 years older than Oscar, and you are not the person that sounds like an idiot ?",0,1405482847,null,0,false,0,ciypn17,t3_2aqf1k,t1_ciypn17,t1_ciypgos,null,1434737714,0,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,0

The thing is, having good depth, finally, and players that can play multiple positions gives us great flexibility. So you can play Lallana on the left and Coutinho as the 10, or Lallana in the midfield with Markovic out wide, or Sterling in the 10 with Markovic out wide, or any of 100 other combinations. I just made a decision to put one possible lineup on there, and tried to put everyone in their best positions. I think, in any big, big game where you have to really put your best team out there, if you had to pick either Lallana or Coutinho to put in the midfield, right now it would be Lallana.

&gt;“telecommunications service” and “telecommunication system” have the
meanings given by section 2(1) of the Regulation of Investigatory
Powers Act 2000


which to me means they didn't redefine it at all; they refer back to the RIPA definitions. 

And even if what you say is true, the Government have already been doing this under RIPA for 14 years, so my point that DRIP does little to change the data retention regime - save for clarifying the wording to give clear legal authority to their actions - still stands. I'm not saying I completely condone this and I'm not even trying to defend the government here really, just pointing out that the real problem started in 2000. 

As for the warrants, RIPA already restricts the situations in which the government can lawfully collect data without a warrant basically to the point where it will very rarely be lawful without the consent of the person whose data is being captured, see RIPA [s. 3](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/23/section/3) for interception of data and [s. 21](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/23/section/21) for obtaining it after the fact. 

In other words, 99 times out of 100 the government will need a warrant. Are they collecting it by proxy and then looking at it (with a warrant)? Yes, but I just wonder what the alternative is? You say go to court and get a warrant first, but they're going to have to do that regardless.

Plus that would probably impact other players coming in as well. How would other players react if we kept throwing complications like that into the works. Would they join us knowing we're this rigid with letting them move on. As far as they know one of the biggest clubs in the world just came and offered to trigger a release clause and we're making incredible demands to prevent the deal.

As for Sanchez I feel like Arsenal opened talks with them much before. We didn't really pursue him seriously until Barca made the first move for Suarez. We can't exactly demand they don't sell him somewhere since again, with the release clause we don't really have much power in the negotiation.

true,Scott_Pilgrim_Fan,null,null,"Depends. What's your favorite genre, era, or companion? Here are some of my recommendations. These aren't the only good books, mind you. But these are reliably good.
From 8's era: Alien Bodies and Unnatural History are both good. 

From 7's era: Love And War; the Timewyrm Series (which started the Seventh Doctor line); Human Nature (which is what the 10th Doctor episode was based off.); Falls The Shadow
(the rest of this list is more from hearsay than personal experience)

From 1's era: The Eleventh Tiger; Man In The Velvet Mask; Campaign (technically non-canon; I'll say more at the bottom)

From Third: Amorality Tale; Rags (note: this novel is graphic, gross, and extremely violent.Tread carefully, especially if you have a weak stomach); Harvest Of Time (written by a critically acclaimed SF writer, Alaister Reynolds)

From 4: Festival of Death; Well-Mannered War.  

Fifth: Goth Opera.

Sixth: Business Unusual;

Ninth: Only Human

Tenth Doctor: Made Of Steel (can't go wrong with Terrance Dick)

Eleventh: Paradox Lost; Touched By An Angel.
 
Consistently good authors of the Missing Adventures , BBC, and Virgin book lines: Paul Cornell, Lawrence Miles, Jim Mortimore, Kate Orman and Jon Blum. Terrance Dick and Malcome Hulke, especially for episode novelizations 

Note about Campaign: it is a novel that was commisioned, but never published. Mostly because it's insane. Jim Mortimore wrote it (he was one of the authors mentioned above. The book involves the First Doctor, Susan, Ian, and Barbara. It is partially inspired by the fact that, had the first Dalek script been rejected, we would have had a script called ""The Masters Of Luxor"" instead, and might have had a completely different series. Telling you almost any of the plot would be a spoiler...all I will say is that it starts with Ian reminiscing about how Barbara died on Skaro...and then sees a confused Barbara,  who remembers Ian dying in battle. And then the universe around the Tardis disappears. And things only get weirder from there.

The reason I mention Campaign, is because since the novel was never made official, so the author gave away the PDF for free. [Here it is. Enjoy.](http://doctorwho.org.nz/archive/campaign/)

League: The  extra Europe games won't help and I think we will struggle to match last season though this is dependant on the signings that are/aren't made. I would like to see a pacy left winger, 20 goal striker and an established but young (23/24) centre half come in to gel with Stones and learn from Jags/Distin. Man Utd will be challenging the top 4 this time, will be interesting to see how Liverpool cope without Suarez too. I could be being pessimistic but I will go for 6th or 7th.

League cup: Martinez will hopefully play a few of the young players and get them some exposure, ideally we can go on a run doing this but I wouldn't be surprised if we went out early doors, a spirited performance from the kids against a seasoned lower league side.

FA cup: It will be interesting to see how Martinez prioritises the FA cup whether he will play weakened sides to focus on Europe and the league. I will predict going out in 5th or 6th round, away against Prem opposition.

No. That is **not** what fucking matters. What matters is performing at the level the club expects of you. If you can't do that then you shouldn't be playing for Chelsea Football Club. He hasn't done that and doesn't seem like he will anytime soon.

This isn't some Sunday league, we don't just tell the boys to ""go do your best, and if not its ok because you tried"". You are brought in as a *professional* football player to perform a task. You are paid an enormous amount of money to produce results. You can try all you want but if you can't do it to the proper expectations then you have failed. 

You seem to not understand that Chelsea Football club is a proper business. Not your mates little neighborhood club where everyone gets medals for ""effort"". Imagine getting paid 200,000 pounds a week and thinking all the club wants you to do is ""try your best"". You really make me laugh man.

true,MGharibian,newcr-6,"suffering at the hands of Martinez' evil twin, Fartinez","I think that expectations are super high, which can be good or bad, I don't know. I also think that the season depends largely on who we get on the left and who we get in the front, and that's really it in terms of transfers– last season we were unlucky with defensive injuries and still had a ridiculously solid defense with who we had, and stones and seamus and baines and howard especially are still improving rapidly.

I also think that although we played better than i've ever seen us play last season, we got lucky to get fifth because of united's implosion, and unlucky to get fifth because we couldn' take full enough advantage of arsenal's implosion (I'm remembering a certain crystal palace tragedy). 

I think Arsenal and Liverpool both have chances of imploding next year again, but United is going to do well, and Arsenal is unlikely now that they have Khedira and especially now that they have Sanchez to finish Ozil's set ups instead of shit giroud. 

United are making big moves and have a proven great manager. I don't see any way in hell that Chelsea, City, and United will miss top 4 next season, and I think Chelsea really has it in the bag if Toure leaves city. If the link up between sanchez and ozil is as good as I expect it to be, I don't see them out of the top four either. 

**BUT** we have that factor that many of those teams don't have, which is a genius manager, young hunger, and a ton of heart. That put us way higher than anyone expected last year (the season expectations thread last year seems laughable now), so I think that is a huge wildcard factor within the odds.

Thank you for your email. Instinctively, I share your concern when the state crosses boundaries and interferes in the private lives of citizens. That is why, for example, I have been a steadfast opponent of identity cards. The balance between rights to privacy and the demands of our security, especially in the face of jihadist terrorism, is one of the hardest things to get right. If we lean too far towards state security we become too like our enemies.


In this instance, I am less concerned (but not unconcerned) by measures that require the retention of information about what contacts have been made than I would be if the actual content of the communication was retained. I am also more sympathetic to the maintenance of existing powers than I would be to the extension of those powers. Finally, the inclusion of a 'sunset' clause makes the bill more palatable than would otherwise be the case. A sunset clause is particularly appropriate when legislation is put before parliament in such a hurried way without even the usual level of scrutiny.


Subject to what I hear in the debates, I will probably give this bill the benefit of the doubt. I have however, made it clear to the government that my support for enhanced state powers cannot be assumed, especially when they impinge directly on the liberty of citizens.


Thank you for taking the trouble to write raising these very important concerns.


Yours sincerely



Graham Brady MP

 [**Birthday problem**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday%20problem): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;In [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory), the __birthday problem__ or __birthday [paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox)__  concerns the [probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability) that, in a set of *n* [randomly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random) chosen people, some pair of them will have the same [birthday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday). By the [pigeonhole principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle), the probability reaches 100% when the number of people reaches 367 (since there are 366 possible birthdays, including February 29). However, 99.9% probability is reached with just 70 people, and 50% probability with 23 people. These conclusions include the assumption that each day of the year (except February 29) is equally probable for a birthday. The history of the problem is obscure, but [W. W. Rouse Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._W._Rouse_Ball) indicated (without citation) that it was first discussed by an ""H. Davenport"", almost certainly [Harold Davenport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Davenport).

He's very good for his age, and I can see him becoming good enough for a top-4 side in a few years if he fulfils his potential, but I think he's still short of what Liverpool would want as a regular starter. He's a quick thinker, learns well and dealt with the pressures and issues of last year pretty maturely - he's always looked like a player with a high ceiling for mental development, and last season cemented that. Having said that, he doesn't always have the best concentration and while he's a capable defender in addition to being a good attacker, he struggles to display both in games, he's prone to lapsing into one ""mode"" at times. But at his age, that's all stuff you expect. Depends if you want to sign a good player who might be great or go for a player like Moreno who's already much further along in his development and represents a safer bet.

From a Swansea perspective, we're losing Michu and possibly Bony, Davies is another star we really can't afford to have leave - especially since his value is likely to rise if he stays another year or two. I also think he'll develop better with another year at Swansea - it's a comfortable home environment, he knows the players and staff and there's a lot less pressure and responsibility. I know I praised how he dealt with the pressure last season (there's be games when he had almost no cover ahead of him, the team went through multiple attacking systems and midfields - his relative consistency under those circumstances is impressive) but there's a difference between Swansea-pressure and CL-pressure, and he won't be as easily forgiven for lapses and weaknesses at Anfield as he would at the Liberty.

3 years fixed 5.89%. The contract says after this I will pay 2% above base rate instead of 5.89%.

Ok so my 3 years finished and I am now on 2% above base rate. Well If I get another product I will probably have to get a rate of 5/6% so whats the point getting another product. Theres not.

The thing is 2% above the base rate was high back in the day so normally you would just get another product. I am just very lucky.

Yes there is normally product fees. Average I guess is between 0-2000 pounds. The ones that are free normally have higher % so you just have to calculate whats best over that term you take the mortgage. You can negotiate to get it free because at the end of the day they want your business.

SO I will stick around on my 2% above the base until I can find a better deal. For the mean time I will stick where I am

Now, that being cleared, no one loves him because he's Spanish. English players are appreciated when they are worth it, case in point, Sturridge and Lallana.

Next, Sevilles performance last season point otherwise, that he actually is a vital part of the team. The way Unai Emery sets up Seville is quite similar to what we play. Fast, pacey pressing game. 

Oh and in case you forgot, Seville actually won the Europa League last year. Alberto Moreno being a vital part of the team then. 

Next, Moreno is a young kid who is actually giving Navarro a run for his money. The latter being a capped player for his country as well. Moreno has made the LB position his own last term, whether you like it or not. 

If you want to stick your head in the sand and delude yourself that he isnt a quality player, you're more than welcome.

I do have another question if you don't mind though.

If you were to chose a shorter term, e.g. 5-7 years, would the interest be higher? The banks are obviously lending you money, so that they can make money back, and the shorter the period of time you take to pay it back, the less return they get on their loan.

So how would that work? Do they charge a higher interest rate? Do they simply take the 'loss'?

Also, assuming that the base rate stayed at 0.5%-1%, and your mortgage was at 3 years fixed rate, with variable rate after that.. your repayments on interest would be significantly lower right? On average 2% above base rate. So would you then be able to pay back more into the mortgage sans interest?

And one final thing regarding tax; You have your mortgage which is X, and then your interest which is Y. If I want to own the property outright ASAP, I would pay back both capital and interest, which would be X/some divisible, and Y. How does tax come into play? What exactly is tax deductable? Or is nothing tax deductable because it's not solely an interest repayment mortgage? And if so, then how does tax work if it was solely an interest repayment mortgage?

GM for example; http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/ditcted2012d3_en.pdf

&gt; Broadly speaking, countries making a substancial shift to GM crops are in a group where food secruity has either shown no improvement (e.g. United States), or where it is declining (e.g. Argentina).

&gt; The predictable pattern and quality of glyphosate herbicide use in GM agriculture has caused the evolution of resistance in weeds on a scale never experienced in the decades of glyphosate use prior to GM crops, leading to a return to tilling and the use of other herbicides for weed control...

This paper also argues that comparing USA and Canada GM crops with EU none GM crops ""...maize yields are very similar in the two agroecosystems, and Western Europes's rapeseed yields are about double those of North America. This trend has not changed since the adoption of GM plants in North America.""

And it talks about the problem of mono-culture which GM promotes and further problems.

There are also no studies that show GM has LONG TERM yield increases.

Then we can go on to the economic argument. GM is just terrible economics, giving the power of the food supply to a handful of transnational corporations [which have monopolistic power] (http://www.etcgroup.org/sites/www.etcgroup.org/files/CartelBeforeHorse11Sep2013.pdf)

[Lobbying is also a problem] (http://www.taxpayer.net/images/uploads/downloads/Political_Power_of_Farm_And_Crop_Insurance_Lobbies_Fact_Sheet.pdf) We surely do not want a handful of companies to have so much power over something as important as the food supply. It has not worked well in the banking sector, utilities, fossil fuels... Monopolistic power is terrible for consumers and great for corporations. We don't want massive food corporations that are too big to fail.

[Or the bullying of farmers] (http://www.motherearthnews.com/homesteading-and-livestock/monsanto-lawsuits-from-family-farmers-zwfz1302zkin.aspx#axzz36IwTZWF7)

 [and this] (http://truth-out.org/news/item/16985-life-in-the-rural-police-state-of-monsanto)
 
There is a lot to be worried about including [our dwindling food varieties] (http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/07/food-ark/food-variety-graphic) which GM does nothing to address and possibly increases the problem.

To say there are no problems with GM is insane.

Nuclear also has problems for example [this shambles] (http://anotherangryvoice.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/35-years-tory-price-fixing.html) Not a good deal for UK citizens.

[Peak Uranium] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_uranium) needs to be considered.

Water use for Nuclear is a big problem compared to solar and wind, this also needs to be considered.

Then there are the obvious problems of Nuclear waste, decommissioning costs and the implicit and explicit insurance the government (tax payers) must give to Nuclear power stations.

I am not saying the GM or Nuclear debate has been won by the anti-GM anti-Nuclear side, all I'm saying is if you are anti-nuclear or anti-GM 1. you are not anti-science and 2. there are a lot of reasons to support your position scientifically as well as economic/political reasons.

1. Opposition to stem cell research, based on ""belief"", but not allowing research to be carried out which would prove it one way or the other.
&gt; “The Green Party believes that experiments on human embryos could have unforeseen outcomes harmful both to individuals and to society. We would work for an immediate international ban on all cloning and genetic manipulation of embryos, whether for research, therapeutic or reproductive purposes.”

2. Sabotaging GM-crop trials which would have helped us understand what works and what doesn't. They don't want us to understand. They'd prefer us all to fear it in ignorance. That's not science.

3. Opposition to nuclear power based mostly on fear and ignorance. I understand how dangerous nuclear power generation and the waste materials are. But the Greens are so opposed that they won't even consider newer reactors which are safer and cleaner than the old ones.

To be fair though, some of the other bigger parties also prefer ideology over evidence-based policy.",0,1405499962,null,0,1405501481,0,ciyumob,t3_2atpoz,t1_ciyumob,t1_ciytkcb,null,1434740024,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

Drogba was perhaps more agile and better in the air than Costa is, but Costa's finishing ability is better than Drogba's as well as his ability to make the perfect off-side breaking attacking run. Drogba at Marseille and Costa at Atleti, though are very comparable.

Under Jose, Drogba learned to play as a proper Target Man. Although this may not happen with Costa, since we aren't trying to play that type of football anymore, Costa should become a more hefty version of a technical, more lethal in the box type CF over the next few years. Whether Costa's hold-up play will match Drogba's is something we don't know yet, but with the players we have playing behind him, and with Costa's amazing football mind, he will open channels for them to attack whilst also providing a legitimate option in pass. 

I'm REALLY looking forward to seeing Cesc play in behind Costa and feeding him scrumptious through balls, which I'm sure he will make the most of.

Each MP had it mentioned on the doorstep, each had to give their view and each will be questioned on it next May. It is also a question of vital import to the world of politics; providing decent standards of living to enable the less wealthy to enter politics and not be either financially harmed or disincentivised from actually doing their jobs well or properly by an even richer political elite willing and able to take the hit is something anyone with a brain should be opposed to.

In contrast to this privacy is not that important an issue to politicians. It is a niche issue for an extreme minority of voters, it is rarely productive to actually campaign on it (note in one of the other threads someone clearly states that they are still unlikely to vote for David Davis despite this being the biggest contribution he has made to parliament). There is little political capital to be made; any issues you have are better solved through reviews, letters and other forms of indirect lobbying.

Also it's possible to look at biological models of the brain and try to construct new machine learning algorithms based on them - like new types of artificial neural networks etc. but tbh it seems that the one's that don't bother with the biology and just go the pure engineering and CS route are more successful. There's neuromorphic hardware too but I'm not an engineer so I steer clear of that stuff. The brain-computer interfaces and neuroprosthetic research is cool, although the neuroprosthetic stuff for the clinical applications is really simple as it has to be really reliable, and BCI doesn't seem to get much funding/research in the UK.

It's quite interesting but academia is basically a dead end with poor pay and bad job security so I wouldn't recommend it as a career, I hope to apply machine learning in data science in industry, or maybe AI if I can learn more things. We had a visit by Google Deepmind and their work is awesome. The robotics stuff like the Robocup is pretty cool too.

Customer By Web Form (xxxx)	13/11/2013 10.32 AM
Hi,

I would like to express my anger and sadness about the purchasing of tickets.

I have been a member for the last few years. I became a member to gain access to be able to buy tickets. I pay for full membership and online subscription.

I logged on this morning at exactly 08:15am to try and purchase some tickets for myself. I only wanted one for a couple of games. I was greeted with a message tell me I have over an hour wait...whilst waiting in the queue I thought I would ring the ticket line and try that way to bolster my chances. I must have phoned a premium rate number, well over a 100 times and greeted with the same message telling me all operators are busy.

I'm still in the queue online, watching the matches I wanted to go to sell out before my eyes. Its demoralising, saddening and angering. I've just checked again and now all games for next year are sold out bar the Everton game and Limited tickets to the Villa game. I can't even get tickets for the Everton game, because as you know I needed to have gone to a certain amount of home games....but how am I mean't to be able to get to these home games if I cant even buy the tickets?

I feel this is extremely unfair. All I want to do is go and watch the team I love. By the time the online session allows me to purchase tickets, all the games will be sold out? What am supposed to do? How am I expected to build my allowance of home games to enable me to get tickets to the higher category games?

You probably won't do anything about this or fob me off and tell me 'this is the fairest way.' But it isn't fair, not in the slightest. It makes me wonder why I both paying for a membership...

I hope you can do something about it,

 Response Via Email (Thomas Wilson)	19/11/2013 09.49 AM
Dear xxxx

I am sorry to hear that you have experienced difficulty in purchasing tickets. 

There were over 80,000 tickets available across the nine home games on sale and by Wednesday evening, all games had sold out. The sale peaked on Tuesday morning with over 30,000 tickets sold in just one hour. 

As with any ticket sale where demand outstrips supply, inevitably some supporters will have been disappointed not to have obtained the tickets they wanted.

After each major sale we undertake a thorough review of every aspect of the process to see what improvements can be made. I will ensure that your comments are passed on as part of this review.

Match Tickets will often become available due to refunds/returns after the game has been confirmed as sold out so I would encourage you to check http://www.liverpoolfc.com/tickets/lfc-members-tickets on a regular basis. Any tickets returned by Season Ticket Holders in the Ticket Exchange are also made available to Members during the week before each Premier League home game. The specific date and time of the sale will be advertised closer to the date of each game.

Once again, please accept my sincere apologies that you did not manage to purchase the tickets you required. I hope that you have found this information useful and that you have more success in purchasing tickets in the future.

Kind Regards

Thomas Wilson

#Answers to some common questions

The level of unemployment is not calculated from the number of people on JSA, so sanctions will not affect it. These figures are based on a survey called the Labour Force Survey. There are unemployed who are not entitled to JSA (e.g. those with a large household income due to a spouse, or those with large savings, or those on sanctions) and there are arguably people on JSA who are not unemployed (i.e. fraudsters). The two are not the same.

The figures are calculated by the Office of National Statistics. They are independent. The government does not interfere with the calculation of the figures, or set the way in which they are calculated. Though knowing how the numbers are calculated does mean governments can set policy accordingly. It may create targets which are not in the best interest of the public. The way the numbers are calculated is based on internationally agreed conventions.

Zero-hour contracts are not measured. However there is some measure of “underemployment” in that those who are in part-time work but wish to be in full-time work are recorded. People self-select whether they are full time or part time. Equally those on temporary contracts who wish to be permanent are also counted. (See above for these figures)

The rate of unemployment is an economic measure of spare labour in the workforce, not a political measure of how well a government is doing at making sure everyone is happy with their job situation. As such, those on workfare, government training programmes or unpaid internships are not counted as unemployed. They do not currently have spare labour to add to the economy. However, those on “Government supported training &amp; employment programmes” are reported separately, so you may recast the figures should you wish. (See above for these figures)

The figures are seasonally adjusted, so there is no effect from things such as Christmas jobs.

Given that the numbers are based on a survey, the figures can never be perfectly accurate and there is a substantial margin of error. The numbers should be seen as approximate and are best understood in terms of the trends they show over time.

Simply having him on the pitch makes life for opposing defenses extremely difficult. Mix that with having the attacking midfield we now have and our squad looks more and more like our championship side of 2006/2007.

Not only that but he is also one of the best in the world at finishing goals. He will become our target in the center of the box and unlike Torres and Eto'o he is not beyond the pinnacle of his career (so we can hope to only see him get better).

Arsenal have strengthened with the Sanchez signing, and if rumours are to be believed (Khedira, etc) they could have a side that really could challenge for the title next season. United have also strengthened their squad, and I can see them doing really well under van Gaal. 

I think that's your top four there. As for Liverpool, I think they'll drop out. I don't care what anyone says, losing Suarez is a devastating blow, and with the extra European games I'm not sure they'll break into that top four again, whereas Man United only have the league to concentrate on at the minute. I don't think Tottenham will be up to much this season, so it'll be us and Liverpool for fifth and sixth, though I can see Liverpool finishing ahead of us with their depth.

As for domestic trophies, it'll be twenty years this season since we won the F.A. Cup in 1995. I'm quite hopeful that we can win one of the competitions we'll be competing in.

Like most of my predictions here, how we do in Europe depends entirely on who we bring in before the end of the window.

Previous to this, the most destructive one we'd seen was when 10 regenerated into 11, and only because he held it back for so long. And even then it was only local damage (fires in the console room, broken windows, etc). Generally speaking, regeneration is only dangerous to those in the immediate vicinity and only when it's a particularly spectacular one. 

Additionally it's implied at many points in the series that the Doctor always experiences traumatic, unpredictable and largely unguided regenerations - for example, Romana was able to ""aim"" at a look she wanted and get it several times over, allowing her to try on new faces til she settled on Lalla Ward.

There are tax loopholes that they know are about and haven't put through laws to close them like avoiding tax on second homes for themselves and a loans loophole which was designed in the 80's to entice foreign investors but at the expense of an estimated £500 million for the UK taxpayer. They have still kept this loophole open due to being so influenced by the financial sector which I think is nuts. 
But then some people avoiding tax will say that the government will only waste their money (2012-13 showed they're not wrong with £120 billion being considered wasted money from government spending) and as quite a substantial amount goes to them, they don't wish to part with it. 


I think the welfare system is a problem of its own which needs dealing with. I personally think it 's more to do with how our society is structured. Big companies consume the little companies putting them out of business and then don't take on as many staff as them and the little companies put together because they want bigger profit margins and so more people are out of work. The government can't support the people either, because they have large company and financial sector lobbyists playing them like puppets making them the priority, so when it comes to welfare, they try to scrape some money back in pathetic taxations such as bedroom tax (still no mansion tax yet, and there's already come about ways of avoiding that). 

Ultimately when a country becomes more concerned about the companies than the citizens, that's where it goes wrong and that's what this country has become.

- Mayuka on the pitch at all was nice, showing off his pace, because we'd missed a pacey striker. Be interesting to see if him (and Sharp also) can actually try to claim a place as back up strikers or not. Most of us have kind of forgotten about them both, but there's always a chance they'll impress Koeman and not go out on loan / be sold.  
* Davis' goal.... Just because it's always great to see our players finish like that.  
+ The formation and players in their positions looked good, I'd be happy with a line up like that (with all of our first team players obviously) come season's start. Interesting to see if we do use that if we'll have Schneiderlin/Cork as CM's, both can play that box-to-box role, or if we'll use Davis, Ward-Prowse as a slightly further forward players.

Unfortunately, if this exercise in corporatisation is executed skilfully enough, they *might* just come up with a successful Wetherspoons-lite (ugh!), but I ain't holding my breath. Data-driven businesses have absolutely no fucking hope in hell of embracing innovation or originality so this looks like a copper-bottomed guarantee of homogenisation, mediocrity, and imitation.

Data collection is an inherently reactive exercise - it can tell you a little about the immediate past and how that might guide the immediate future, but it has no fucking clue whatsoever about novel ideas, nor intangibles such as atmosphere, personality, and so on. It's a guarantee that the business will be guided only by what can be measured. I'd expect nothing less from a banker.

This is the fourth or fifth thread I've seen on this sub about our rivals. I'm not scared, we did it last season and you can't say we haven't already strengthened in many positions whilst only losing one key player. No player is bigger than the club, Suarez isn't irreplaceable. But at the same time we can't come to expect instant success after one very good season. Rodgers has been here two full seasons and it's clear that we're in the initial steps of a plan which has a larger scope than 2-3 seasons.

I was in the exact same position as you a few years ago, and the only way I could make it work was to borrow from my parents (approx £2.5k to get started). I blew pretty much all of it moving to London - there's going to be so many costs you don't expect (travel costs, suits, shoes, flat deposit, socializing with new work buddies, one month rent up front etc etc). Also when do you get paid at your new job - one month up front, or one month in arrears? This could easily add the best part of £1k to the debt you have to take on. When do you get your signing bonus - I know people who only got theirs after a 6 month probation period.


I would try desperately to avoid the loan for something like this if you possibly can. You won't have that much disposable income when you start out, and you don't want it tied up into loan payments if at all possible. Can you pickup some temp work before you start, even for min wage? Can you ask the bank to extend your student overdraft, especially if it's interest free? Can you ask family or relatives to help as you're just getting started out? Can you stay with a friend for a month until your first paycheck comes in? Have you got any stuff that you could sell that you don't need anymore (that guitar and amp you're never ever going to play again?)

Either way, good luck.

It makes them immune to an injury crisis and means they always have an option from the bench, but it doesn't actually make a *huge* difference. They're going to start each match with 11 world-class players whatever happens.

The main way it affects us is that by hoovering up and sequestering all the good players, those available to us are a step down.

It's who our fellow second-tier teams sign that worries me: Arsenal, Spurs and Man Utd. A player like Sanchez might be enough to make Arsenal significantly better than us (although I feared the same when they signed Özil). Add Khedira to the mix and we could be in trouble.

Interesting reading, but I think the focus on under-investment in northern cities is odd.

If you read the report, it's about better co-ordination in planning at a city-metro level and more infrastructure investment in the UK as a whole, but with a bigger proportion being spent outside of London than at present.

Most of the references to the North and northern cities within the report come about because they are referencing the Chancellors speech on the need for a Northern Powerhouse, or about the Northern Hub rail project.

Mentions of underinvestment are only ever about the UK as a whole under spending compared to other nations. Much of the data the report shows doesn't actually distinguish between north and south, and when it does there's not that much of a difference.

The table on broadband access shows that only Scotland is really losing out, and the table on congestion shows 3 out of the 5 worst cities are southern. Only Belfast has worse congestion than London.

* [Castell Coch](http://cadw.wales.gov.uk/daysout/castell-coch/?lang=en)
* [National Museum of Wales](http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/cardiff/) (Art and national history these days - the history stuff has moved out to St. Fagans. Has quite a good collection of impressionist paintings - Monet and Turner and the like.)
* [St. Fagans](http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/stfagans/) (Includes exhibitions on Welsh history and a large open air museum containing buildings of historical significance that were moved from their original locations and reconstructed stone by stone.)
* [Cardiff Bay](http://cardiffbay.co.uk/) (Home of the Millenium Centre, the National Assembly and the Doctor Who Experience, amongst other stuff. A walk along the barrage can be a good way to cool off on a hot day.)
* [Bute Park](http://bute-park.com/)
* Roath Park

**Sights in the surrounding area** (which should be reasonably accessible by public transport)

* [Caerphilly Castle](http://cadw.wales.gov.uk/daysout/caerphilly-castle/?lang=en) (Second biggest castle in Britain after Windsor)
* [Caerleon](http://www.caerleon.net/intro/index.htm) (A suburb of Newport once home to a Roman legionary fortress on the scale of Chester or York. Plenty of remains to see including an amphitheatre and baths complex. There's also a small museum exhibiting Roman finds from across Wales.)
* [Gower Peninsula](http://www.enjoygower.com/index.cfm) (Beautiful landscapes...Rhossili Bay and Three Cliffs Bay would be top of my list to see. Easily accessible by bus from Swansea.)
* [Brecon Beacons National Park](http://www.breconbeacons.org/) (You mentioned hiking. This is where you'll find it. The best hiking is to be found along the main escarpment between Brecon and Merthyr. It's also an extremely forgiving mountain range, if you let it be. Pen-y-Fan, the highest peak at 886 m / 2907 ft, is a doddle if you approach from the Storey Arms to the south. I presume there are buses which pass the Storey Arms on the way between Brecon and Merthyr, but perhaps someone who's actually local could fill you in properly on that!)

If you do have access to a car, I highly recommend visiting [Waterfall Country](http://www.visitwales.com/things-to-do/activities/walking-hiking/waterfall-country) and the [Black Mountains](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mountains,_Wales) (plural, not singular - there's also a Black Mountain at the other end of the National Park) for some more great walks.

It's an absolute fraction of what you would get in the UK I imagine, but still feels worthwhile.  I'm truly happy to pay.

I have long thought, including when I lived in the UK, that a subscription fee would be a fairer way to fund the BBC.  Possibly subsidised to some extent so the BBC can also function as a public information service (news etc is very costly and usually a huge loss maker for any organisation).  

The fact is that there are people who never watch the BBC but are forced to pay for the licence fee despite subscribing to expensive pay-TV channels. They're usually hard core fans of sports that are only on pay channels, or people that rarely watch TV except for the movie channel, etc.  These people really shouldn't have to pay for a service they never use.

Or if it is considered that the BBC is a public benefit that we should all pay for regardless of use, like the NHS or public education, then just fund it through tax (which is how the ABC in Australia is funded - [see here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation#Funding)).

c) What they're buying
d) If they're price sensitive (ie do they go for the cheaper stuff, or do they just stick to what they know). 
e) If they buy food, how many covers? This tells us if they're coming in with family, etc.

With that out of the way, we've obviously got people that aren't using loyalty cards. Fine. For those, the till gives us a lot of information - each individual product is tracked. So it's not just in as ""mixers"", but ""Mixers -&gt; Britvic -&gt; Orange"". Again, this helps us track what's being sold and when. The information isn't as useful here, but it helps. 

Vouchers/mailouts and flyers. If you ""like"" their Facebook page (or sign up for their newsletter), you get a voucher entitling you to a free pudding. You also get a loyalty card. The voucher code is unique. This then ties back to the loyalty card, but we also get their Facebook information. Kerching. So, they rock up, order their food - we'll know when they came in, what they ordered, and so on. Loyalty card then tracks them for the future. As I say, the added bonus here is that we know utterly shedloads about their from their FB profile. 

We offer the punters free wifi. Captive portal that you need to sign in through. We track the MAC addresses used, and know who that device belongs to (by virtue of tying back the e-mail address used for the sign in to the wifi and the sign up to the loyalty card). We know *when* that person is in the pub, even if they've not signed in to the wifi. This one is scarily good. 

All in, we're quite pleased with the progress. Especially so given that the projections are being utterly blitzed. 

Data is fun :)

Ninja edit: Forgot, but we've not got that far yet - any loyalty card not seen for 6 months gets a ""Hey, we've not seen you recently"" offer - but since they've been in for less than six months, we've not got that far yet, as I say.",0,1405510602,null,0,1405510799,0,ciywo6c,t3_2aufye,t1_ciywo6c,t3_2aufye,null,1434741131,62,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,62

If we want to play with a target man we need wide forwards who can score lot of goals. Again i dont think we have players for that system.

I think the best option would be to spend money a quality number 10 and buy remy, we already have lambert for games we need aerial threat. I think sturridge will score a lot of goals if we built the system around him and remy can play wide and can also be a backup to sturridge.

If it's always been an indoor cat I would think it will be excellent company for you. 

It may be naughty and/or require a lot of playing with depending on its age; a 4 year old cat will need a lot more stimulation than a 10 year old cat does.

Also, what breed it is? Breeds such as siamese tend to be very highly strung and as such cry a LOT. I mean drive you up the wall levels of a lot, constantly, for hours and hours at a time. 

Now, can you afford to keep a cat? This is especially important if the cat is going to have access to outdoors, because you really need pet insurance (unless you're wealthy and can afford vets bills) to cover what the little blighters can (and will) pick up. Bills for kitty leukemia run to £4k plus so I cannot stress the importance of thinking about how you're going to pay for any illness kitty may pick up - including simple things such as being treated after a fight for infected scratches. 

Finally, depending on the temperament of the cat, you may wish to get another to keep it company. They mostly prefer to be in pairs or more. However, this won't apply if the cat has always been alone/has a history of being grouchy around other cats. But even then you'd be surprised - 4 or 6 weeks can see grouchy cats become BFFs in some instances. 

And of course, obligatory pics pls. 

ps: fuck dogs - needy little smelly shits and they'll drive you crazy, and they'll want constant walking.

Edit: don't own a cat if you are precious about your things.

true,here_involuntarily,null,null,"For me personally, the desire to own a house is about freedom. I currently pay nearly £700 a month for rent. I live with my boyfriend, but we cant find a cheaper house in about a 30 miles radius. Last week we saw a ""house"" that was £450 a month that was a kitchen, a bathroom and a living room with a bed in the corner. It was tiny. It feels crazy that we're paying for our landlord's mortgage (I checked, mortgage on that house would be about £500 a month). We can afford it, but we will never be able to save money for the deposit.


Also, with a rented house, we can't do anything. Can't have pets. Can't paint the walls. It's a pretty shitty house and things keep breaking (ceiling has collpased twice in 18 months, shower has broken three or four times, the oven broke). It takes weeks before the landlord comes to fix it because she gets quotes from several people and then waits for the cheapest. Then because she gets the cheapest, it breaks again.


Owning my own house means it can look how I want it and thus it feels like MY home. It means I can have pets. Means I don't have to worry about breaking something if I want to have people over. Means I can replace the mouldy shower screen or plant a vegetable patch in the garden.

The idea that anti-Thatcher people shouldn't want home ownership because Thatcher wanted it is flawed logic: Thatcher strived for home ownership, people on Reddit want home ownership, therefore people on Reddit should like thatcher.

It's similar to the logic that Hitler had a vegetarian diet, Hitler was evil, therefore all those on vegetarian diets are evil.

Nobody in their right mind thought that *everything* Thatcher thought, said or did was wrong, otherwise you could chastise and anti-Thatcherite as being inconsistent because they e.g wear shoes, or walk using 2 legs.

Now the population's bigger and older (and fatter), we're competing with people from all over the world for work, UK oil and gas production has crashed and we're having to import energy (this is an expensive thing to do!) and the government is suddenly having to pay out on all these grand promises that it made in a time of relative plenty.

He wants kids but can't afford a 2 bed place so its unlikely to happen anytime soon. 

We need a huge reform in how housing in the UK works. One suggestion would be to ban foreign nationals buying new property. They should only be allowed to buy existing properties (and put cap on the number of properties at that). 

Buy-to-let landlords should face a 50% tax on any earnings on the rent. This will force them to invest the money left over from the mortgage payments into the property or loose it to the taxman. 

Management fees for tenants should be abolished through the UK and we should adopt the European model or minimum of standard 3, 5 or 10 year contracts. If the landlord sells the property then you are safe to stay. 

Banks should offer the European model for deposits for renters. They will 'loan' you the deposit. I know when I moved it was a huge pain to save up 6 weeks rents, onto of the £500 agency fees and rent upfront. 

I could go on for hours about rentals in the UK. I think we really need to push for a more European solution. It should be noted that its not a silver bullet though. In Europe, with the added freedoms afforded to tenants, they have more responsibilities.

""I'll be philosophical. Until about two billion years ago, it was impossible to have any life on earth; that is, there was so much radiation on earth you couldn't have any life — fish or anything. Gradually, about two billion years ago, the amount of radiation on this planet—and probably in the entire system—reduced and made it possible for some form of life to begin... Now when we go back to using nuclear power, we are creating something which nature tried to destroy to make life possible... Every time you produce radiation, you produce something that has a certain half-life, in some cases for billions of years. I think the human race is going to wreck itself, and it is important that we get control of this horrible force and try to eliminate it... I do not believe that nuclear power is worth it if it creates radiation. Then you might ask me why do I have nuclear powered ships. That is a necessary evil. I would sink them all.

The monthly repayments would be very different if it was capital and interest where as if it was interest only it would be the same payment regardless of the mortgage length (assuming same interest rate stayed the same). 

The bank makes more money the slower you pay it back. 

If the interest rate drops from fixed to a lower variable rate the repayment would drop so you can add further overpayments to go back up the amount you want to chuck into that mortgage. 

Only the interest is tax deductible. But every month in a repayment mortgage the ratio of interest:capital gradually tilts towards capital more over time. Effectively you over time reduce what can be offset against your tax bill and have larger tax bills because the gap between your costs and profit has increased. 

To take an interest only mortgage. Assume £6000 a year in payments. Rent recieved was £12000. You only pay income tax on the difference.

Paedophilia is so demonised in our media, and obviously entirely rightly, but that equally makes it much more difficult for paedophiles to reach the help they need to control their sexuality so as not to ever harm anyone.

What it does allow us to see, however, is how quickly things are selling. The data backs up what they're doing, and allows them to analyse and predict what's going to happen. Ok, so you can probably get a feel for that from being stood behind the bar, but if you've got five staff on for a Friday night, you can see where your peaks and troughs are, and also what kind of customer is buying what. 

It can help us find the sweet spot in pricing, for instance. As an example: They ran an offer recently, where every pint was 10p cheaper. Thing is, though, that during the period they ran that, they didn't actually sell any more beer. That week was the same as the one before it. And the one before it. And the one before it. So we know that people will actually pay the 'normal' price for beer, and that cost (or at least 10p less) isn't actually a factor. This is an incredibly useful bit of knowledge. 

What we're trying to do is make things sustainable. We're six months in, but we're not resting on our laurels. We know that people are fickle. But, if, through the data we can learn what people like, then that helps us. If we know who are customers are and they stop coming, then we can try to bring them back. The flipside is that even this might not help us. People here are saying this is a really good idea, which it is - but it's only a very small part of it. It's not the field of dreams: You can't just build it and they'll come. You need to give the customers a reason to be there. The data is just another facet. A tool.

true,Daniel-H,null,null,"Here are my reasons:

1. I'm super-pessimistic. I'm American and the two sports teams I follow here in the US have won a combined 0 league titles. Nothing ever goes well. Players get injured like it's going out of style. Chelsea overall isn't nearly that bad, although I think about the last former Atleti player we signed and my dark imagination thinks up terrible thoughts.

2. He's had injury problems. Of course it's nothing a time and maybe a little horse placenta can't solve, but it worries me.

3. He flopped for Spain. In multiple ways. I'm sorry, but part of me thinks that he only functions well under Simeone, a coach who instills the mentality that Costa thrives in.

4. The Torres Cycle. I know that this doesn't always happen, but it often happens like this: 1) the player is expected to score 20 goals, 2) they score 10, and are deemed a ""flop"" and, because they play for Chelsea (or any big club, really), crucified in the media 3) their confidence sinks like a rock, and they continue to do poorly. I've seen this before, and not just at Chelsea. Big signings becoming flops is a staple in all sports, I'm afraid to say.

5. The Premier League is better than La Liga. Yeah, I'm a bit of a snob. The reason that I feel much better about Fabregas than Costa is because he's proven in this league. I've seen players move to a bigger league and succeed, but I've also seen them fail. And yeah, I know that the gap isn't that big, but I think there's still a gap between Getafe or Elche or whatever and a rainy Tuesday at Stoke.

Overall, it just boils down to that I'm pessimistic. I'm not rooting against him, and I'm not trying to put a voodoo curse on him; I hope I'm wrong! But I'm pessimistic about this deal. This is a big reason why I want Mourinho to keep Lukaku. In addition to him being a *deadly* Super-Sub, he's also an insurance policy on Costa.

It's facile to attribute the ban of DDT solely to Rachel Carson: the scientific community in the 60s and 70s was becoming more and more aware of the effects of POPs, which ultimately culminated in the Stockholm Convention (which contains provisions for the limited use of DDT).

Also, the widespread use of DDT in the 20th has resulted in resistant strains emerging, which will therefore further reduce its effectiveness in the future.

Now, remember in the 50th when 10 mentions at the place of the Moment that they shouldn't have been allowed to be there, because it was locked. Keep in mind this was just after they spent hours trying to get out of an unlocked dungeon because it was supposed to be locked. 
What we learn in the 50th is that Gallifrey wasn't destroyed, it was hidden. The Daleks weren't destroyed, they annihilated each other firing upon the now missing Gallifrey. This explains how they were able to escape and recoup their numbers. 
We also learn that once the time line gets back in sync, The Doctor won't remember saving Gallifrey, or working with each other.

But again, is this really high and whether it will last indefinitely?

Let's analyse pressure on local services. If there are classes with 25 children, then 1% increase in population means there would have to be 4 years until 1 extra pupil increase in a group's number. Let's say 100 people attend local A&amp;E daily - there would be 1 extra patient, making it 101 daily patients after one year of higher immigration.

&gt;And of course the distribution is not equal either because many go to live in just a few areas, upsetting the locals.

That is somehow correct although I've seen distribution of Polish population in the UK and it was pretty well distributed among all of the UK. Of course some areas have seen higher increase but that lead (if I remember correctly) to total 6% population in some most densely Polish populated areas (including the fact these often got into such higher point due to the fact of past migration as in after the II WW).

I tried to take her out once, but she was terrified and kept crying until I carried her back in. I take time to play with her every day and she is a very friendly and inquisitive cat, so I don't think indoor-only life is doing her any harm. 

To keep her occupied, I had to try several cat toys to see which type she likes best - she doesn't care for catnip mice or bouncy things, but she loves chasing feathers on a stick and playing with a 'kickeroo' toy she can bite and kick. She also has a plastic circular track with a ball inside (she plays with it all the time) and a big 'cat tree' which she loves but seems to be a bit too hot for the summer. I get all of these things plus the food and litter online for about £20 per month (not counting the initial purchase of litter box, scratching post etc).

I would strongly suggest vaccinating and, if it's a female cat, spaying it. House cats are less likely to get diseases, but I think it's still worth keeping the shots up just in case. You can get the vet to visit you at home, if you are willing to pay the extra money.

Not under the charter they can't. There's a limited window following a broadcast, except in a few exceptional circumstances (which is about to be changed to make it a little longer for most programmes, though slightly shorter for others).

Nope. The BBC owns the entire copyright in, to all intents and purposes, nothing. Indeed, here's a paper from the BBC explaining how dozens of bits of copyright clearance are involved in Doctor Who - http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipreview-c4e-sub-bbc.pdf

I'm sure that in the context of things it really doesn't matter because these ""marquee"" signing often tend to be over rated (Suarez really wasn't a big thing until we turned him into one) but at the same time it does kinda bum me out that Chelsea is getting Costa and Cesc, Arsenal is getting Sanchez and Khedira, and we're just getting Can and Lallana.

But once again not to contradict myself, but to put things into context this doesn't mean as much in the real world as it does on paper.

The time war happened in a ficton that encompassed all of time and space (and many alternate realities). Entire worlds began, were destroyed, and had their history changed only to begin and be destroyed again. The Time Lords and the Daleks had time travel. There could be no winning as each could go back and undo the other's victories.   

But from a time traveler's perspective, they can remember events that are made to not-happen.  So the weight of all of this destruction caused the Doctor to declare ""NO MORE"".  He un-made the time war destroying the Daleks and Time Lords together.  As we find, this destruction was not complete. But a time lock was placed such that neither side could un-do his un-make. (Time travel and alternate reality syntax sucks)

Later (Time of the Doctor) he un-made this decision, Placing Gallifrey in an alternate dimension. The Daleks seem to have survived as well, being present later (or earlier) for the seige of Trensalor. 

So when does it take place?  All of space and time.  But that ficton does not exist anymore.

&gt;PD102 The United Kingdom has not been under significant threat of armed invasion since 1941 and such an event is unlikely to occur in the foreseeable future.

In the first instance, they do not hold all of the facts. The Green Party have not the faintest idea of whether or not we've been under threat of invasion or attack since 1941. They are not privy to such information.

This is also a sort of pointless comment. Indeed, a direct attack on the people of the United Kingdom is highly unlikely, but when you weigh up risk vs reward it's a no brainer.

We currently spend 2.3% of our GDP on defence. A tiny fraction of our economic output, and it ensures that there is virtually no chance of a foreign power successfully attacking sovereign British soil.

Many countries get on fine without any such military, but they do so only because they are allied with countries like the United States, France and the United Kingdom.

&gt;PD202 ""Defence"" is the protection of homeland against attack and does not justify pre-emptive strikes against nations and organisations.

Highly debatable and an extremely broad statement. If you can see NK has successfully put a nuclear payload on a missile capable of reaching the UK, they tell you they are going to attack, and all intelligence shows that they are legitimately going to fire, do you do nothing?

&gt;Real security cannot be based upon a balance of nuclear terror, nor upon a global domination by a group of states operating largely from self-interest. 

All states operate in self-interest. That is their entire function.

&gt;PD207 In those desperate situations when this becomes impossible and some form of military intervention involving UK forces is necessary in the immediate term to prevent conflict or extreme and sustained oppression, it must be under the auspices of the United Nations (UN) or within Europe under the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).

What, we're no longer allowed to make our own military decisions? I understand we all want to avoid another Iraq, but simply pushing the decision onto someone else is not a solution.

&gt;PD301 We would promote town twinning, exchange visits, pen friend schemes and Internet-based methods for learning about other countries and cultures by direct contact. One of the main purposes of embassies would be to learn about culture and current affairs of their host countries by immersion in a wide variety of local activities. 

And this is in their defence policy. Really? Pen pals are going to prevent wars?

&gt;PD302 On inspection, there is little or no threat of direct invasion of the UK by any nation.

And the Green Party know this how?

&gt;Any threat of invasion that might arise in the future is so remote that realignment of the UK military and defence preparations would be possible long before any invasion occurred.

This. This is the one that really gets me. It's frighteningly naive. You cannot *possibly* determine how long you have to prepare for a threat until the threat emerges.

&gt;PD307 Military action must have the mandate of the UK Parliament. To support effective military action, this need be no more than an outline of the campaign but necessary speed of response is no excuse when Parliament can be called at a day's notice.

The military deals in hours and minutes, not days. This is ridiculous.

&gt;Outside times of conflict, all military decisions and expenditure will be available for scrutiny by Parliament and the public.

There is literally no such thing as being outside times of conflict in the modern world. All countries spy on one another. All countries look to gain advantage.

&gt; A Green government would rely upon intelligence mainly gathered openly from a wide range of sources. We would have a more extensive network of independent contacts in regular communication across the world, engaged in other genuine economic activities, passively picking up political, social and military information by their very presence within a society.

I can't even begin to describe how stupid this is.

They claim that they'd be able to see any threat coming in time to prepare, but would rely on 'passively picking up political, social and military information by their very presence within a society'?

&gt;PD512 Because of previous involvement in UN peacekeeping operations, Britain is well placed to assist in an international training programme on behalf of the UN, as well as to supply personnel and equipment.

No, Britain is well placed because it has traditionally always had one of the best equipped and well trained militaries.

true,IntellegentIdiot,flair5,,"This has always been my preferred strategy. In some ways it's high risk in the short term but long term it's best. The smartest thing to do would be to poach players from the teams around us. It would cost us more but I think it's more cost effective than our current strategies. I think buying players who have no premier league experience and who are also likely to leave us makes their lower cost a bit of a false economy. If you factor in the year or so it takes them to get up to speed and the risk that they won't make it here then it's often cheaper in the long term to get players who have shown their capabilities in the Premier League. 

Last summer I was hoping that we'd get Demba Ba, Benteke or Cisse. Perhaps even Lukaku. I'd rather spend £15-20m on a player like that who's proven than buy three £7m players who don't really improve the squad. The problem is our net spend is very low, even last season we probably spent less money that we took in and the only time I can remember us having a negative net spend was the season before we got into the CL.

I think our main priority this summer needs to be a striker. I think it's extremely premature to write-off Soldado but we need another top striker in case he doesn't work out or in case he's injured if he does. We need a third striker and I think Harry Kane has proven that he's better than Adebayor so I'd like to see him take the back up spot.

Dear Anna,

Thank you for replying to my email. I found your explanation of why this bill is being pushed through parliament with such haste reasonable, if perhaps somewhat unsatisfactory. My main concern about his bill is that it will not be used for its purported purpose - to protect the country from a very real threat of terrorism - but instead will be used as an excuse to defame, undermine and investigate political opposition; to maintain the ""status quo""; to violate the right to privacy that is specified by the EU (http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/code-eu-online-rights); and altogether to set a vile precedent for invasion of privacy that I doubt anyone would reasonably desire.

History has shown that mass surveillance does not work to prevent terrorism. East Germany, the USSR, and China have all tried and failed to squash ""terrorists"" using these methods, and they have all failed. 

Not only has this sort of surveillance been shown to fail, but from a philosophical standpoint it is morally wrong. Retaining data about online activity is akin to recording everywhere that a person goes in their life - even their own home - and storing it 'just in case'. The recent revelations provided by Edward Snowden about the NSA and GCHQ cannot be ignored with respect to this matter, and passing new laws in an altogether undemocratic manner such as this bill only allows this sort of behaviour to continue. I do not want to live in a world where my emails are opened, recorded, stored and then passed along for no reason other than an ephemeral claim of terrorism or paedophilia or other crimes. 

I cannot in good faith ever vote for an official who would support these ideas, and I will not be voting for you or your party in any election until the stance is changed. I will also make sure to do all that I can to convince others not to vote in your favour. It can also be reasonably concluded that if you are receiving many emails about this issue, then perhaps many people in your constituency are concerned about it and you are therefore duty bound to represent them as their civil servant.

Yours sincerely,

xxx

Speculation: size differences between genders mean physical intimidation of a man by a woman can be less immediately obvious; prevailing social opinion is that men are stronger and more powerful so can take care of themselves; people have less exposure to violent/abusive women so don't view one as a ""real"" risk - they might be of the misinformed opinion that women are prone to meaningless emotional outbursts and are physically weak anyway so the whole thing can be safely ignored because she's not actually a danger to the man. Probably many more reasons that I'm not intelligent enough to think of. 

I've heard of several occasions where no one has stepped in to help a woman being physically abused in public because ""it's a domestic dispute."" I guess this is why OP posted this anecdote as a success - because they too are familiar with or aware of this reported-as-common reaction.

I'd argue that saying women are unfairly favoured in these situations simplifies the issue unfortunately - it's assumptions about both genders that contribute to people acting or not acting. Plus of course valid concerns about personal safety in a violent or volatile situation.

We currently have 2 other senior players who have experience as a striker. 

Lambert has shown he can score and assist at a respectable rate in the league and his on field relationship with Lallana is an added bonus.

Borini had a decent season at Sunderland and should improve again now that he'll be playing ahead of our midfield not Sunderland's awful excuse for one. If nothing else he's a younger and better Cup option than Aspas who's used to the way football in England is played.

Does this mean we shouldn't try and find another? No, but we're looking for a very specific player in terms of skill set and ability.

We need a hardworking, athletic player who can be effective in both the build up and score goals, who is a clear upgrade on Lambert/Borini while being willing to accept that Sturridge is the main man.

Anybody coming to mind? And if we get this very specific player then what becomes of Borini? Lambert's age and love of LFC mean he'll be relatively happy with 10 or a 1000 minutes for the season.

Go to Yelp, Google Local reviews, Tripadvisor. Customers run into crappy service everywhere, but in this case the reason behind the crappy service is a person's religion, so therefore it's worse? Why? 

If I don't get served because you're a dick or I don't get served because you're slavishly adhering to some medieval edict, why does it matter? I didn't get served. If I get served mere seconds later I have a few choices; go home, complain anyway, either to the manager or up the ladder to head office, and lastly call the newspapers. In 99% of the time people don't call the newspaper.

&gt;So you'd expect customers to go out of their own way to satisfy the needs of one employee down to their religious beliefs/opinion?

Your comment can thus be translated as ""So you'd expect customers to do something completely inconsequential and trivial that would have zero effect on their life or the lives of those around them and in no way leads to a net negative consequence outside their own head?"". That's what I'm refuting here, the notion that it matters either way. The only reason this lady went to the press and this story is here is because it's religion.

EDIT: addressing this one point.

&gt;You seem to be jumping the gun quite a bit...

My mum died just over 18 months ago and left me and my brother her house and cash / shares etc, totalling about £750k.  Obviously half that and you have what I ended up with.

I had an accountant almost imposed on me, as they were the ones to deal with mum's will, sorted out Probate and inheritance tax.  They have suggested to me that I put my money in a Trust, run by the accountancy firm.  They run the trust and invest the money on my behalf, paying me an amount of money that I request, but also they provide advice on what to do with it so that it both grows and stays safe.  With the amount you're talking about, you should be able to earn about £1,000 a month and still increase the amount of money you hold in your investments.

Another trick with trusts is that they can also be used to hold property and other non-cash assets.  You can basically sign a piece of paper that says ""this trust now owns my property"".  You then receive the benefits of the trust owning the property, as you are the beneficiary (i.e. you live in your house rent-free).  This means that if you get married and later divorced, your ex would not take half your assets, as *technically* they don't belong to you at all.

But London is a very mixed city. If you're a young black person from a council estate and every police officer you ever see is white and from the countryside, Would you feel that they could relate to you?

I'm white, middle class, live in the countryside at the moment. If all police officers were black and from the city, I wouldn't feel that they knew what life was like here and how things work and are done. There's nothing racist or prejudice in it, people just like to feel that the police are representative of the general public.

The same people who say that the police need to use discretion more often and understand people's circumstances when it comes to things like drug usage, will be the people standing up now saying this is unfair and the police don't need to be representative because all they have to do is uphold the law. But it's hard to use discretion if you don't know people's general circumstances.

Does someone who has lived their whole life in a leafy village in the South West really understand drug usage in a city? Do they understand how hard it is for young people in some areas to stay clean? Do they understand the social pressure? The cultural pressure? They catch a 14 year old with weed, will they consider not ruining his life for this incident based upon knowing the circumstances of the area he lives, or will they just think ""well drugs are illegal so that's that?""

Policing is all about public confidence. The public need to feel that the police are there to protect them and help them, but also need to feel that the police understand them. If you have a very low percentage of Arabic officers, how comfortable will some Arabic people be to talk to the police? They might not feel that the police represent them. Some cultures take things like this very seriously, and you can't simply say ""tough, you will talk to this white officer,"" because they just won't do it.

Everyone should always be chosen on merit, and I doubt anyone who wasn't suitable will ever be given the job (although, and this is a bigger issue IMO, they have lowered the pass mark needed at the assessment days to 50% now), but if the police don't make an effort to in some way represent the communities they serve, the community will lack confidence and trust in them.

The same way people don't like how so many MPs are white men and feel MPs should be more diverse to be able to better represent the people they work for, so should the police.

It's a very very tricky situation, but simply saying ""just accept everyone from anywhere on merit,"" although it sounds wonderful, causes problems with police relations with the public.

As bad as it is (in terms of quotas), you do need diversity. If the police were 100% white men, even if they were absolutely the best people who had applied over all women and other races, it wouldn't be good because people won't feel like the police can relate to them, their culture, their religion etc. It's human nature to trust familiar things more than the unfamiliar.

Neither of us can hope to understand RIPA. Even with a team it would be hard and aspects would always be changing and rely on interpretations.


&gt;“telecommunications service” 

The notes clearly state that “telecommunications service” will NOW mean things like gmail, most likely even a comments section on a blog or anything online with text sharing, even games. That wasn't in RIPA, if it was it wouldn't need to now be ""clarified"".


&gt;RIPA already restricts the situations in which the government can lawfully collect data without a warrant basically to the point where it will very rarely be lawful without the consent of the person whose data is being captured

it's getting other people to collect it, without our consent, without a warrant. 

&gt;99 times out of 100 the government will need a warrant

For what? 

To look at the collected data, to get a copy of the collected data?  It sure as hell isn't to collect the data. It's already been collected.

&gt;I just wonder what the alternative is?

If they suspect someone..... get a warrant, order isps etc... to save all that persons data. Exploit their computers, rain down the full arsenal of surveillance tools on their ass. Get a warrant first.


**This is Targeted versus Mass Surveillance**

They are going down the mass surveillance route like idiots. Push back is already huge to that method, and the chilling effects for normal people are massive.

Implying that we will always have a government that is ""good"" and only plays by the rules....what if you become inconvenient.

     tesco are of ""National Interest"", I mean jobs n' all.

     Tesco want to knock down your house to build a superstore

     You start a campaign to stop it

     All your history, your google searches etc... are available to be used against you

     You watched 1guy1jar video online (a few times, showed it to a friend)

     It's over, you may as well give tesco your house for fuck all. You may even lose your job by the time all your search history is taken out of context and used against you.

That is just one example.

* what if it's a malicious actor who gets the history of your searches etc.. ?

* what if the people in power are power hungry and corrupted by business?

They can fit you up for anything. Design a new solar panel.... sorry but that is too disruptive.


Point is, all that collected data is a liability to us all. We are all, far less secure from bad actors which may include the government itself.

The data already is collected. A warrant is irrelevant and a mere technicality. A bad actor just needs access to the data. The surveillance is already done.


&gt;You say go to court and get a warrant first, but they're going to have to do that regardless. 


Again....No, the data is already collected, the warrant is for LEGALLY looking at it or LEGALLY getting a copy.   

*Some people in some governments will make stuff ""legal"" after the fact.*

No, at that point I'm requesting the manager who themselves will have to do something about it. Again, as I've said, it's only as inconvenient as *you* are prepared to allow it to be. In most cases moving to another till won't be as arduous as you describe and in the cases it is I'm not about to move, so the shop will have to accommodate me.

Not the point. What other countries want to do is up to them. But I would imagine that most Brits go abroad with more money - like people retiring to the south of france or buying holiday homes.

&gt;if a immigrant who speaks less english than you and has been here two seconds is able to steal your job you are a loser; 

I agree. But the UK does have people like that. Is it fair that they are hard hit by immigration?

Also, what you are saying is not quite that simple. We have plenty of people working as waiters, cleaners, behind bars and other low skilled work who CAN be easily replaced by foreigner. But as the program showed, if you have 20 people all sharing a house together, they can afford to live on a much lower salary than Brits. All credit to them for working hard, but is that really the sort of thing we want to encourage? Do we now expect our school leavers to go and share with 19 other people just so their employer can keep paying them minimum wage? That sounds like a step backwards to me, not progress.

That said, I would have hired the nice Polish girl instead of the gormless entitled English guy too!

Besides, there are plenty of other arguments as well as the silly ""taking our jobs"" one. There's the burden on public services. Plus the rapid change in culture in some areas.

* **Boswells** - The largest selection of French Skincare I've seen, it's seriously enourmous. And they have samples for pretty much everything except wash of cleansers and sunscreen.

The price point is high, waaaayyy to high for what they promise, and I'll be honest their body range is leaps and bounds over their facial skincare range. They don't have any active acids in their products, so no BHAs or AHAs. The *Almond* body range is good, as is their *Shea Butter* it's expensive but it is Fair Trade produced in Burkina Faso from women co-ops. I actually really like their Divine Cream &amp; Immortelle Serum, but I doubt I'll repurchase as I no longer have staff discount ;__; But the great thing about this brand is that they have testers of *everything* and give out samples generously.

In reality, I'd expect the majority of exit nodes to be run by security services, who would then be free to monitor and reconstitute traffic that passes through them. Consider that the security services have the means (the budget to run a few dozen 1Gbs exit-points is barely significant), the motive and the opportunity to run such a modest operation. It would suprise me if they weren't.

The dust is still settling in the post-Snowden world we find ourselves in. Concepts such as 'absolute security' or 'absolute privacy' were never thought to be absolute when theoretical considerations were taken into account, but they were just that - theoretical considerations. Today it is fully established that pretty much nothing can be trusted. If you try to construct a 'safe' system, you'll end up going mad from the uncertainty.

Tor exit nodes are likely compromised

How will you pay for the VPN? Where will it be based? What logs will they keep? What logs can be forensically extracted from their systems? Is your tunnel trustworthy? How do they peer with the Internet?

Most distributions contain harmfull non-free software, or encourage the use of such software. The security surface area is typically massive, with millions of lines of code installed by default.

true,deepobedience,cnty-wales,Wales,"Okay, I think I get where you are coming from.

I don't mean to cause offence, but I'm just wondering, who do you imagine the British Military is actually defending you from? I suspect your answer is of course ""We don't know! That's the point"". But if that is the point then how can you know how big the military has to be? If you need to defend against Russia, or China, 2% of GDP spending will be pitiful. So plainly one needs to work on the basis of plausibly military threats, indeed, the military will already be doing that to prioritize spending, so this is nothing new for the people involved.

You say that there is no way any country could invade Britain. I know you know that really isn't the case, if we exclude the nuclear deterrent, you are well aware that the entire British military could probably be defeated by a single US carrier and support vessels. Likewise China could do the same. What you mean to say is ""No plausible country could do it"". And I think, when you think about it, no plausibly country could defeat the british military if it was funded at 1% of GDP. So again, we come back to the question of plausible threats. Indeed, I'm tempted to say that the only countries that are plausible threats are those with significantly bigger militaries than yours, and hence you're always in trouble, because Britain is never going to have the biggest military.

My personal belief, which I believe can be supported by the evidence, is that the age of world wars is over. Even excluding nuclear deterrents, there are too many rich people with a lot of power, who realize that wars are really a great way to waste money. You don't go to war with countries you trade with, because trade, by it's nature, is mutually beneficial. The more the economies of nations are superceeded by the economies of corporations, the less war will happen of a nation to nation level. However, I thoroughly respect your opinion if you differ on this.

Now don't get me wrong, a lot of the Greens policies are a bit silly, as you point out, the pen pals one is bordering on comical. But the fundamental point is demilitarisation. And I think that is a laudable goal. While it may seem naive, it is still a truism that if no one used a weapon, there would be no wars. And history is littered with the proof of what arms races are like. So again, demilitarisation (not complete, but heading in that direction) seems reasonable to me.

The other thing I want to say is, why is America seen as not a threat? It certainly isn't because of the size of the British navy. It's because Britain and the US share common values, common trade, common history and common goals. And I think the Greens do have some degree of the truth of it there. True peace can not be achieved by achieving a world wide state of mutually assured destruction.

I really believe Sturridge will lead the line and create tons of space for the likes of Sterling, Markovic and Lallana/Coutinho to run into. Sturridge is one of the most active strikers around and always moves around. One of the better results of the 2 striker partnership was that Sturridge learned that moving out wide and creating plays doesn't mean someone will take over his position or that he won't get goals. Sometimes his assists and goals come from letting other players occupy the box while he cuts in from the right to shoot or pass combining his striking ability with his dribbling.

10 million for someone we could get 10 years of service is short sighted when we could just spunk the second highest fee we've ever paid on a left back who would probably do better, but probably be sold in a few years when Madrid comes knocking. We clearly have different views on wasteful. If Davies flops, we lose 10 mil. If rodriguez flops, 30. Stupidly huge risk for us when we don't have as deep pockets as our rivals.

Just because he feels he should be ahead of Torres, Ba, and Shurrle doesn't mean he thinks he's ""the greatest thing since sliced bread"" when he most definitely should have been. Even this season Lukaku only scored 4 less goals than Eto'o, Torres and Ba combined.

By the same token, Costa last year is not at all the same as Costa this year. He had a sensational season and bumped himself up to the top player level in world football. As you can see, we made no attempt to pursue him this summer. Last year he was on the same level as a guy like Markovic or Lallana, in my opinion.

Further, bidding for a player has nothing to do with paying over the odds for a player. I think this year has shown that FSG and Rodgers do not want to waste time with players who they don't think want to join.

true,metamongoose,null,null,"If you give a cat just dry food, then it will eat whenever it is hungry, not overeat, and not beg you for food as much (a generalisation but it holds up quite often I think).

If you give it wet food regularly, then it will prefer it and tend to eat it more quickly, and start to understand meal times and beg you for food more. A cat fed wet food should still have dry food available.

It really boils down to what kind of interaction and relationship you want with your cat. If you like the idea of it being excited by you giving it food, and don't mind the begging that will result, then give it wet food. This will mean that you'll feel bad if you can't be there when it expects to be fed, which limits your options and ties you more to the role of cat feeder.

If you'd rather free yourself from the role of feeder somewhat, then just give it dry food. It'll still come to you for attention and company, especially if you play with it and give it plenty of strokes and affection, but the slight disconnect between you and food will place you on a more equal footing. Plus you'll be able to give it a bunch of food and leave for a couple of days without much worry. (but not for extended periods of time, cats do get lonely)

As far as nutrition goes, pretty much all food will provide the right nutrition. Pet food is always well balanced, much better than human food in that respect!

You can use wet food, or fresh meat, as a treat now and again with a dry food diet, but too often and the cat will go off dry food and beg all the time.

He's been on another level whenever I've seen him play in the youth squad. He must be seen as the successor to the CDM slot, and maybe why we have seemingly decided to keep Lucas for the foreseeable future instead of buying a younger talent.

the club must believe that either (or both) rossiter or chirivella will be our CDM of the future. I'm really excited about Rossiter though, I think he's the most promising player I've seen in the youth squad since sterling (suso and ibe deserve a shout though).

excited to see if smith has progressed at all, he's always been a fantastic athlete. hes got a pretty decent overall game, hopefully it can translate to the next level.

As technically good as Adorjan is I don't think he'll make it here.
Coady as well I don't see it making here. Even though he's a smart player, I'm not sure if he's physically strong enough for the premier league.

Peterson has looked good from the little i've seen of him. can't really see him making the breakthrough though.

No need to get so defensive. I'm as loyal as you can be. But I don't agree with most of comments here that it happened last season, happens every season etc. This season's transfer window is shaping up different to most seasons. 

Chelsea have been in a transitional phase since AVB with apparent problems regarding playmaking and strikers which they are fixing this season. 

Arsenal had injuries crippling their speedy player and midfield work horses last year, which they are fixing with top quality. And Man Utd are fixing midfield problems which have been apparent since Fergie's last few seasons.

I wasn't worried last year since frankly I thought most of the teams had poor windows last year. Arsenal only got Ozil at the end, and Chelsea were just hoarding more attacking midfielders rather than fixing their key areas. Spurs were just buying a bunch of starters who in all likelihood would not click. 

I'm not trying to be a cry baby here, or some such silly thing. But I do believe this window has been exceptional in some ways compared to the previous few years. It's not about just Sanchez.

I would say even though our defence was dodgy as hell last season we probably have very high tackles per game and such just because we were leaving our back line exposed so often and giving the defenders more to do. Could be there are some defenders who were only called upon to do something three or four times a game, but what's important would be that when they did their positioning and timing was absolutely spot-on. It could be as a defender your interceptions and tackles are low because you're so well positioned for the striker you're marking that nobody bothers trying to give them the ball to begin with.

This is an embodiment of FSG's actual philosophy--pay for what a player is worth at that moment, not what they will be or could be. Suarez came to the club making less than £100k and got two new contracts with us that ended up increasing his wages by nearly 300%. 

Sanchez has proven he is a top-class player and he would be worth big wages. That was a case of Sanchez flat out not choosing to join Liverpool for non-financial reasons, which is yet another reason why we haven't gone after the best players in the world. Liverpool hasn't shown we can compete with the other best clubs on the pitch. That is a more depressing reason, though, I must say, which would explain why people like to blame Ian Ayre, Rodgers or FSG instead of accepting the harsh reality.

Rodriguez isn't worth big wages now, nor are a number of other targets (I just use Rodriguez as an example of the type of player FSG wouldn't go after this summer). What they will do is sign him at fair wages and then give him improved terms if he produces.

&gt;You're really getting good at playing the apologist for this kind of thing, aren't you?

Which part have I apologised for exactly? Is it the bit I called the guy an idiot? OR the part where I called the law on pork/alcohol a medieval edict? Or was it the part where I am simply wondering why you and others like you will take these small incidents and try to paint this broad picture of looming civil decay 

&gt;Plenty of people have explained to you that in a trip to any shop where you are the customer and the shop is in theory going to serve you – there’s no good reason to have to re-queue to accommodate their employees personal bias towards what they will and will not sell. The employees quite simply should not work there.

*Plenty* of people have done no such thing. One person has stressed the importance of the role shop workers but as I've said it's an over-exaggerated point meant to make this minor inconvenience seem like more of a detriment to society. Complain, move on. Another shop assistant will help you. You won't go without your pork or alcohol. If you're *that* aggrieved take your business elsewhere, the shop will suffer for it. Making it a press matter and the press actually going along with it is more disturbing to me.  

&gt;I don’t think anyone is suggesting the slippery slope you keep focussing on

Yes they have. Specifically saying ""If they allow this what else do they allow?!"". 

&gt;you can look at the above comments and see they’re all to do with the supermarket and getting served there

And that would only be an issue if you literally could not get served in any other way by any other member of staff. Like I've said, in most cases the manager comes over and sorts it or another staff member does.

&gt;We shouldn’t have to live in that kind of society where – even if it is a minor inconvenience to most – is allowed to manifest itself.

Look at that sentence! You're going to sit there and pretend I am the one overstating people's concerns then say with no hint of irony ""we shouldn't have to live in a society where..."" in a conversation about a woman not getting her chipolatas fast enough!

It's a minor issue. We shouldn't have to live in a society where trains are late...we shouldn't have to live in a society where cars break down...we shouldn't have to live in a society where post goes missing...we shouldn't have to live in a society where keys break in a lock. Do you not see how absurd it is to say that sentence in regard to such a non issue? Like you yourself have pointed out, the market will determine how much of this shops like Tesco will put up with and if they err on the side of the customer or the staff. I'm of the opinion it's such a localised and minor issue managers will simply have a word with said staff and they'll be moved to another section or be fired, but none of it needs to be in the press.",0,1405525404,null,0,false,0,ciz2eyi,t3_2augdv,t1_ciz2eyi,t1_ciz1q3k,null,1434744083,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

If we buy him for 30 million, he's most likely going to perform. If he gets poached by one of the big money clubs, we'll have the ability to sell him for more than 30 million and make a profit on him. I don't care if Davies is league proven---Rodriguez is world proven. He was one of the brightest LB's in the WC. League proven should not be something we use to measure the value of a player. What does that even mean? He can play in the PL? By that account, then Flanno is also league proven and therefore we should be fine with having him as an option. However, I think we can all agree we can do better than Flanno and that's part of the reason why we're out for a LB in the first place. It's about bringing in talent that will make your team better and more competitive. Davies doesn't add anything we don't already have in Enrique or Flannagan.

Signing Davies is just not good enough. I don't like this conformist attitude surrounding our targets that's been developing on this sub and seemingly within the club during this transfer window. We're in a position where, given the loss of Suarez, we have to make sure we're injecting nothing but quality into the team so we can secure a top 4 spot again, especially when all of our rivals are seriously strengthening their squads. We simply can't afford to lose the top four spot. We have to do everything in our power to remain there if it is we want to be considered a serious competitor domestically and abroad by other players. That means bringing in only quality players into the team. As decent as Ben Davies might be, I don't think he'll contribute much, if anything, to make a difference between us being top 4 or not.

2. He hasn't really had injury problems, it was a simple injury that every player gets a couple of times in his career. The only reason people made something of the injury is because it was so badly timed and he was that desperate to play in the Champs League he tried to play through it and couldn't.

3. Did he flop for Spain? The entire Spanish team was woeful. The manager had a complete nightmare. The team didn't suit Costa at all or the style of play. First of all why would you play both Alonso and Busquets? Why wouldn't you take Navas, especially when the only other pacey player(not including defenders) in the team is Pedro. You pretty much had Alonso and Busquets sitting deep and then Silva and Iniesta making space **behind** Costa but nobody was making forward runs past him, making space for him to run into. If you start Costa you need to start Fabregas behind him and Navas on the wing, it's that simple. Again though, it's not like he was the only one who didn't do well, in fact there was at least 5 Spain players who has worse tournaments.

4. It's completely different, Torres was bought because he's Torres and not because he fitted into our team. Costa is a player that suits our team down to the tee.

Another example of this is her support of wide spread high tax, apart from when it comes to mansions or banks.  Also against investment in new jobs.

Now there are good things I can say about her, but much of the ""reforms"" she supports involve removing Government involvement in a whay that makes everything someone else's problem, for example tuition fees and Academies.

But there are good things here with electoral reform, although unfortunately not a pr system of any kind. 

she also seems to be against gay rights but for gay marriage, what's with that?
