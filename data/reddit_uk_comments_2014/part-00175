true,FetusVomit,null,null,"I'm going to make a few points because it seems you guys really have made a lot of untrue assumptions about how healthcare works in the US. First, when you get treatment, you get a bill like this even if you have insurance. She may have insurance and just be shocked by what the insurance company has to pay. Insurance companies also negotiate with hospitals if the bill is higher than what they normally get from other hospitals for similar services.  

Second, with Obamacare, everyone is required to have insurance and if you're poor, the government gives it to you for free. Poor seems to be a pretty loose metric, my girlfriend make $12/hr, works 35hr a week, and qualified for 100% free, $0 deductible health insurance. We both have it and it's probably better than any health insurance I've had before.  

Third, even before this, if you didn't have health insurance and had a catastrophic medical need, there are things set up to handle it. My friend passed out, hit his head, and had a grand maul seizure. He was in the ICU for a week and had a mild aneurysm. His final bill? $200k+ Is he destitute and confined to a life at a debtors prison? Of course not. A nice lady came in the day he was being discharged, he signed that he didn't have insurance, provided a bank statement and pay stub to show his assets and income, his final bill was around $800 that he paid of in installments. Rich bastards love having their names engraved on plaques in hospitals so they donate tons of money to them.  

Is our system perfect? Are all the stories of people getting ruined by medical bills false? Of course not, but a lot of what people think about our system doesn't really reflect reality. Our government isn't setup to run a national healthcare system. We can't even provide proper [healthcare for our veterans](http://www.usatoday.com/story/nation/2014/04/08/va-cancer-treatment-deaths-delay-veterans-hospitals/7457255/) for fucks sake and providing veterans healthcare is not a controversial issue. As of now, most employers provide healthcare, and if they don't and/or you're too poor to afford healthcare, the government provides it to you for free so there's little reason why anyone shouldn't have health insurance.",0,1403243091,null,0,false,0,cica7tv,t3_28jom3,t1_cica7tv,t3_28jom3,null,1434320644,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Tariffs can mean one of two things; the monthly charge if you're on a contract plan or the cost of calls/text/data within the plan either contract (monthly) or PAYG.  Since  you're looking at a PAYG sim all you need to worry about is how much it costs to do whatever you want to use the phone for and if there's a minimum amount (usually £10 a month if there is) you need to top up by every month.

I've used EE (when it was still T-Mobile) in the UK on PAYG and never had any problems with coverage.  IIRC I didn't *need* to top up every month, but things like 500mb data cost £5 for 30 days.

or perhaps

&gt;But I want you to understand that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of a woman, and God is the head of Christ. *[1 Cor. 11:3](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+cor+11%3A3&amp;version=NASB)*

&gt;34 The women are to keep silent in the churches; for they are not permitted to speak, but are to subject themselves, just as the Law also says. 35 If they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is improper for a woman to speak in church. *[1 Cor. 14:34-35](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+14%3A34-35&amp;version=NASB)*

I'm sticking to the NT here, so no wafle about a new covenant gets Christians off the hook, but the OT is full of contempt for women too. In fact, Genesis, for example:

&gt;To the woman He said, “I will greatly multiply Your pain in childbirth, In pain you will bring forth children; Yet your desire will be for your husband, And he will rule over you.” *[Gen. 3:16](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+3:16)*

The Guild suffers from the undying capitalist spirit of Ankh-Morpork, as those men who are paid per-fire extinguished eventually begin to guarantee a regular supply of fires to be put out (see also Inn-Sewer-Ants). This has led to the frequent destruction of large portions of the city and ultimately to the Guild's being banned.

It also has lead to one of the finest lines in all of Pratchettdom: ""The penny really dropped after 'Charcoal Wednesday'"".

For what it's worth, my neurologist prescribed the fast-release ""bio"" melatonin rather than the more common (in the US anyway) slow/timed-release stuff.

The only thing I'd say as a 'warning' of sorts is that you should be really, really careful about trying to alter your sleep cycles (whether with melatonin or light). It's quite easy to mess them up and not so easy (and in some cases, impossible) to rectify them. It would be worth keeping a chart of the times you wake and sleep for a few weeks before you start on the melatonin, and continue for a few weeks once you're taking it, to see if there's an underlying issue and if/how the melatonin is affecting it.

While mine are messed up due to some innate biological/neurological issue, melatonin does affect the sleep mechanisms and you really don't want to end up with a messed up circadian rhythm, believe me.
There are quite a few ways to chart the sleep patterns but I was using the MedHelp sleep tracker here http://www.medhelp.org/user_trackers/show/562572 (if you skip back to around May 2014 you can see my circadian disorder in full effect - for a normal person there should be no diagonal 'staircase' pattern).",0,1403251991,null,0,false,0,cicc9o2,t3_28lm51,t1_cicc9o2,t1_cicbvwx,null,1434321673,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3

I could see the curvature of the earth, and there was a city of incredibly tall buildings filling the horizon.  A barn silo or something like that flew by in the air, turning in the wind, and when it landed in the city, it blew up, and the skyscrapers began to slowly fall through the atmosphere towards us, but not directly.

Other Christian doctrine, that often stems from sources other than the bible and is commonly contradictory to it. Members of other religions who contcert to Protestantism are welcome to join, as religion is a matter of choice.

&gt;They herald and wave flags that aren't even recognised as being legal

They aren't allowed to have their own identity? The Ulster Banner is the flag used to represent Northern Ireland in the commonwealth games.

&gt;Sing a national anthem that isn't theirs

Its the national anthem of the UK, if you're talking about our foreign brethren I understand but they can still pledge loyalty to the Queen and pray that she prospers. 
 
&gt;Engage in a made up denomination of christianity formed by a loonybin here 50 years ago

While I normally have very little to say in support of the free P church, it still confirms to the Westminster confession of faith and catechisms, not to mention is tiny percentage of the denominations involved in the Orange, biggest two being real Presbyterians and Church of Ireland.


&gt;People are marching holding signs saying to end the hatred of Orange culture - Newsflash Orange culture is hatred, it is Sectarianism and it is shrouded in a Supremacy based ideology 

None of the liturgy or ceremony says that and it is actively discouraged within the order and liturgy.

&gt;Who else in the world celebrates by burning another country's flag and passing it off as a tradition ?

Loads of people burn flags, its a valid manner to express a political message, whether that message is: an expression of resistance against a state, dissatisfaction with their actions/policies. Of course there are other things you can express by burning a flag not all if it is something I'd agree with. The Bonfires are traditional, the burning of the flag maybe not so much. Its rarely the lodge who organise bonfires so you can't pin that one on us.

&gt;Why would I want to partake in that - Why would anybody looking on the outside in want to celebrate it ? 

Because civil and religious liberty is important?

&gt;Why the fuck would I want to go to a parade to watch bands playing the same songs over and over again it's not even something you could bring kids to watch with floats and various other things normally associated with parades

Until you've seen the Alarde in Hondiribia, Spain you can't complain about them playing the same tunes over and over (they have one song on repeat.) And its not even the case bands are constantly learning new songs and their rotations. Why can't you bring kids to it? They can enjoy the music the colourful uniforms just the general spectacle.

None of this has stopped other countries from outlawing possession of seeds though.  I suspect the reason why the UK has not done so is maybe the difficulty in proving what a seed is actually from. I have not done an extensive study of every seed out there but I am sure there are probably lots of seeds from other plants that could be indistinguishable until you germinate them. They are also said to occur a lot in bird seed so there is also a chance of possessing one without knowing you do.

Unfortunately, employment law in the UK heavily favours the employer, thanks to some recent changes by the coalition government. It used to be free to go to tribunal and you could do so after 1 year.

Location also in my opinion. Regardless of what's being manufactured, there are more attractive locations elsewhere in Britain. I mean that in purely transport logistics terms.

Then agglomeration economics. Businesses tend to huddle together, which provides an advantage to areas that already have a strong manufacturing industry. The Valleys, unfortunately, only had mining. Now that's gone they have nothing, and attracting the first big investment is the hardest.

To give an example, Wales' biggest (or most prestigious) manufacturing nowadays is Airbus wings. There they already had expertise from the DH plant, so the main challenge was scaleability. That's easy enough, just a question of investment. And the nature of the investment means the wings are easy to transport (either by plane or barge) to Toulouse.

true,Jammieroo,uk,Worcestersauceshire,"One of the three measures that the 'Healthy Lives' category measures is healthy life expectancy at 60 and I would suggest that that is based around more than just what doctors can do for a patient. It will depend on social care, support networks and general lifestyle but health is a factor. [Another contributing factor will be disease rates in cardiovascular because like in the US everyone is getting fat which is definitely happening faster here that in some of the Scandinavian Countries](http://www.downeyobesityreport.com/wp-content/uploads//OECD-Health-Data-2011.png). Now that is not the health service's fault but they still have to cope with it and work within this situation. Diabetes in this country is going to explode in the next decade.

It is being privatised. Just really slowly.

The way it starts is with the private hospitals picking off the easy stuff, things that have a low entry level cost like elective procedures and they can cream off what little profit there is from the national tariff. This means that NHS hospitals have lower income from easy things and more outgoings from the harder stuff. This contributes to not being able to pay off the PFI debt that most hospitals have following Labour's PFI initiative.

Already they cherry pick patients, people with private insurance get rejected from the private sector because their symptoms are too severe (eg. following a stroke). These people still end up in the NHS despite having paid. Following this when bidding for contracts under 'Any willing provider' the statistics can be shown so it looks like the private hospitals have better recovery rates BECAUSE they cream off the good patients. This creates a two-tier service where they can reject anyone who is too complex, make more profit off the patients they have while NHS hospitals will make a loss on the ones they're left with. 

Now I'm not saying the NHS is perfect but with a huge restructure happening near enough every 5 damn years they're doing well.  I really hope that someone has some better ideas than either Labour or the Tories because this is one thing they probably should just ask for advice from clinicians about and listen to them rather than squabbling between themselves about who has it sorted. As an example in my local area clinically we should only have one A&amp;E department because there aren't enough doctors to cover both and for 'efficiency' so they can focus specialist cardiac teams in one site etc but politically that is very unpopular as obviously local people don't want their A&amp;E shut. So obviously the MPs are against the closure....but they introduced the laws meaning the NHS needs to be more efficient....so......?

TL:DR- Social factors contribute to that category, the NHS is fucked ",0,1403255390,null,0,1403257054,0,ciccv3f,t3_28jom3,t1_ciccv3f,t1_cibunjs,null,1434321953,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,ddosn,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"""It is being privatised. Just really slowly.

The way it starts is with the private hospitals picking off the easy stuff, things that have a low entry level cost like elective procedures and they can cream off what little profit there is from the national tariff. This means that NHS hospitals have lower income from easy things and more outgoings from the harder stuff. This contributes to not being able to pay off the PFI debt that most hospitals have following Labour's PFI initiative.

Already they cherry pick patients, people with private insurance get rejected from the private sector because their symptoms are too severe (eg. following a stroke). These people still end up in the NHS despite having paid. Following this when bidding for contracts under 'Any willing provider' the statistics can be shown so it looks like the private hospitals have better recovery rates BECAUSE they cream off the good patients. This creates a two-tier service where they can reject anyone who is too complex, make more profit off the patients they have while NHS hospitals will make a loss on the ones they're left with. ""

Except that is not what is being created by the UK Government.

The government will issue the contracts for already failing hospitals (it wont be done to all hospitals, only failing ones) and once the contract is issued to a private venture, the government will supervise to make sure quality and accessibility are improving.

Going back the case study I mentioned earlier in this thread, the Hospital that went from one of the worst to one of the best in 3 years thanks to being run by a private venture was not turning away patients if their symptoms were too severe.

That would be against the terms of the contract and, if found to be happening by the government inspectors, the private company would lose its contract.

""I really hope that someone has some better ideas than either Labour or the Tories because this is one thing they probably should just ask for advice from clinicians about and listen to them rather than squabbling between themselves about who has it sorted.""

Clinicians *used* to run the damn health service before Labour screwed it over royally with their useless non-jobs and managers. The Tories have been trying to get the NHS back in the hands of the clinicians and the only way they seem to think they can do that is by *temporarily* putting failing facilities in the hands of the private sector, which has repeatedly shown to lead to clinicians/medical professionals being put back in charge of the hospitals and clinics.

""As an example in my local area clinically we should only have one A&amp;E department because there aren't enough doctors to cover both and for 'efficiency' so they can focus specialist cardiac teams in one site etc but politically that is very unpopular as obviously local people don't want their A&amp;E shut. So obviously the MPs are against the closure....but they introduced the laws meaning the NHS needs to be more efficient....so......?""

It depends how close the hospitals are. If they are very close, specialising each one is not a problem and will not lead to problems. If they are very far apart, then there will be problems.

An example I can share, living in Leeds, is a small local hospital (Chapel Allerton Hospital) does not do childrens A&amp;E anymore, its been moved to the LGI or St James'. This will not change much as the hospitals are not really that far apart. Chapel Allerton Hospital is in the Inner suburbs and the LGI and St James' are in the city centre, a difference of a couple miles and 8-9 minutes at most.

With Baines you need the left winger to offer support and pick up the runs, but for England Welbeck would receive the ball and instantly make a BEELine for the centre of the field, completely missing the overlap that Baines would be creating. 

For Everton the players know to make dummy runs to free up space and always search for the overlap, never allowing themselves out of simple passing range to the wide left. If we had played a more traditional wing based game on the flanks we would have beaten Uruguay, but time and again our wingers were looking to push into the centre, where their play was instantly shutdown by the numbers of players they packed out the middle of the park with.

I think he could still be good enough to play in Euro 2016. Who else do England have in his position, his style? Carrick? People may point to Wilshere or Barkley but they play much further forward and don't have Gerrard's vision.

What's best for his Liverpool career is a different matter. But internationals don't add many extra fixtures and if anything else it keeps him match fit during the summer.

In the event of a write-off (which seems likely given the photos), as others have said, don't accept the first valuation, get examples of cars for sale of similar age / mileage and submit those to your insurance company. Try and find examples for sale at used car dealerships rather than private sales as they'll generally marked up at a higher price.

They have previously funded some really odd things like the spread of JFK conspiracy theories, as well other things to try to incite unrest in the west.

Whether you have an issue with egalitarianism/modern left or not is not my concern, my concern is Christians who portray their religion in a liberal light but whose mainstream denominations preach something different. If anything you are merely vindicating my point, that mainstream Christianity cannot say it is liberal and pro-gender equality. There may be liberal elements in the churches but the doctrine is conservative in nature.

Also facts? As I understood it most sensible biblical scholars now accept that the bible is open to interpretation and cannot be read literally, especially considering all the different contradictory gospels and Apocrypha.

I think that after years of a Labour government young people on the left are keen to have an evil empire to kick against, like their parents did. Name one thing that Cameron has done that's even *close* to the poll tax, or the way Thatcher dismantled the mining industry.

The way my parents talk about Thatcher is having the sense - or even knowledge - that she just didn't give a crap about you. My Mum used to say it was like she just drew a line across the country and just fucked everyone north of it. I'm from Liverpool, incidentally. She drove through her ideological changes which led to massive recessions, whole communities dying on their feet and - crucially - she did not appear to care even in the slightest, going so far as to castigate those who were hurt by her policies as communists and so on. Honestly, my parents were university educated and so in a better position that many of their contemporaries, but they still got thrown on the scrapheap and the city in the 80s was horrific. Cameron just can't inflict that kind of damage, and he hasn't. At the risk of sounding like one of the Four Yorkshiremen - kids today just don't know how good they have it. ""Oh no, Cameron has part-privatised the NHS!"", ""Oh no, Cameron's cabinet doesn't have enough women in it!"" ... seriously put that in context with the miners' strike, or the poll tax, or the NHS under Thatcher. Christ alive.

I'm a former civil servant, and if that experience taught me anything it's that modern policy is by and large *not* driven by big personalities and ideology - it's about winning votes. That's the difference - they might chance their mind if you complain enough. Thatcher hardly ever did - if she wanted something done she'd push it through no matter how many people it hurt. Cameron lacks that - he's weak, he's not even really in control of his own party, and every idea he has is a vain flail to attract votes. There's a different between that an an implacable ideologue like Maggie. Being a civil servant has brought me from firmly on the left to more centre-left, because I've been working for and with conservatives who do care, even if their perspective on life comes from a different place. I don't see politics as a black and white game in the way that many of the people who complain about Cameron appear to do.

TL;DR - Cameron is nowhere near as bad because he doesn't know what he's doing, and is just trying to win votes. Thatcher was a politician with A Vision that excluded half the country and she pursued that agenda with terrifying single-mindedness. The North is still reeling from Thatcherism.

It is. 

&gt;  From the, pretty bad, photo: it looks like my car could be a write off. Does anyone else agree?

Borderline without photos of under the bonnet. Although it looks quite bad its quite superficial damage for the most part. Maybe £1500-£2000 of repairs. 

&gt; Do I have to pay for his car's damage? If so, would that be more than my £650 excess?

Your insurance company will. The damage to his car will probably cost more to fix than yours was worth especially when you add in the cost of the hire car they'll have, the lost wages, any injuries they claim for. That was an expensive VW you hit.

&gt; How much will this shoot up my insurance premiums and is there a way to lesson the impact?

You'll lose whatever NCB you have for a start and this has the potential to be a £20k-£30k claim or even more depending on what injury they suffered, how much time they have to take off work and what their income is. If they don't get whiplash from that I'll be surprised.

true,Jammieroo,uk,Worcestersauceshire,"*Except that is not what is being created by the UK Government.
The government will issue the contracts for already failing hospitals (it wont be done to all hospitals, only failing ones) and once the contract is issued to a private venture, the government will supervise to make sure quality and accessibility are improving.
Going back the case study I mentioned earlier in this thread, the Hospital that went from one of the worst to one of the best in 3 years thanks to being run by a private venture was not turning away patients if their symptoms were too severe.
That would be against the terms of the contract and, if found to be happening by the government inspectors, the private company would lose its contract.*

That is not what I’m referring to, you are talking about takeover of a site I am referring to changes in commissioning locally. The small things are where it starts- carpal tunnels being done in BMI hospitals for example or the stroke patients who have rehab in private providers. Money follows the patients in these situations and the government itself has no control as it will fall within local commissioning arrangements. Patient choice is important however this is where you get the misleading statistics. Take the surgeons having their death figures published-ones that are more risky and would take a chance (with patient consent) are at a disadvantage as it looks like they have more fatalities but this is because they are the people who are willing to try where others wouldn't. This was all through freedom of information-currently private hospitals don't even have to abide by freedom of information which the NHS do. This was discussed in parliament last year-the government response was that it would be an unnecessary burden on businesses. Fair enough..so why do NHS hospitals have to do it if the same services can be provided in the private sector and not have the same obligation.

*Clinicians used to run the damn health service before Labour screwed it over royally with their useless non-jobs and managers. The Tories have been trying to get the NHS back in the hands of the clinicians and the only way they seem to think they can do that is by temporarily putting failing facilities in the hands of the private sector, which has repeatedly shown to lead to clinicians/medical professionals being put back in charge of the hospitals and clinics.*

I agree Labour cocked up, I don’t think the Tories have it sorted either though. Take clinical commissioning-which is the main purpose of the reforms. There are few CCGs (clinical commissioning groups) who have a chief operating officer who is a clinician despite that being a major recommendation (I can’t find the exact numbers but it’s less than half). My personal favourite load of rubbish the Tories bought in was making is so commissioners can’t look at patient data to plan pathways or hold providers to account because that’s not direct patient care-but then at the same time sell the data to private insurance companies. I can see why it should be anonymous but the IT solutions do not exist to do this efficiently currently so right now the same GP who sees patient and is a direct carer cannot look at the data for their patients to check its accuracy or to improve the pathway of care for other patients. There is an entire industry of commissioning support units, CCGs and NHS England’s Area Teams that were created through reforms. I can assure you there is not less non clinical management now and regardless of providers (ie.hospitals) commissioning will always exist while there is a commissioner/provider split.

Our hospitals are half an hour apart with no traffic. Clinically it was agreed it was better to rationalise and also it will help the hospital start to claw its way out of its PFI debt. Every situation is different and it’s based on the history of the area. Here when Kidderminster A&amp;E shut an independent MP was elected solely on that issue, not that he could do anything about it. 
An interesting case is the [Lewisham hospital ruling](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-24729477) where a good hospital A&amp;E was being shut (which probably could have been done safely) which was obviously very unpopular. A court judge overturned the minister’s decision to close the A&amp;E meaning the public won but that trust is still now stuck with a financial problem.  This has far reaching implications for all the areas facing closing A&amp;E departments and I’ll be interested to see what happens as the minister is trying to overturn/work around the court ruling.

I really don't think either of them really know what they're doing but it's probably because it's so complicated that it's hard to condense it in to a snappy election manifesto. The devil is in the detail and when there is the level of bureaucracy that exists currently it's impossible to make change happen quickly so changing the system every time there is an election just doesn't help. It shouldn't be a partisan issue mainly for this reason-so changes can actually bed in and the strategy for the NHS can span longer than a few years.

It's possible to play all the key players in their best positions but with a stubborn manager like Roy Hodgson, the players fit the system, not the other way around.

That's what I love about Brendan, he sees problems and finds solutions, we played a midfield two at the start of the season, it didn't work and he changed it. Hodgson must've known this and still uses two Liverpool midfielders in a midfield two, baffling, even from Hodgson.

true,Cputerace,null,null,"&gt;The previous sentence still says the wife must submit therefore giving the man primacy in the relationship

Yes, the biblical model of a household has the father as the leader. If you don't agree with the father being the leader, that's fine, you don't have to follow it. It is not, however, a license for the man to dominate and put down his family. The quote about wives submitting goes on to say ""For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church"". Look at the example Christ is in how he leads the church. He sacrificed his life for the church, he left his throne to be beaten and killed for the church. That is the context by which the man should ""lead"" the family.

&gt;and has thus been used as an excuse throughout history (amongst other parts of the Judeo-Christian doctrine which place women in a secondary role) to oppress and disenfranchise women. 

Which is wrong, and exactly why I am pointing out the context within which ""submit to your husbands"" is given, because if you read the entire section of the bible, you in no way can surmise that the historical oppression and disenfranchisement of women is acceptable.

The scripture verse is blamed for oppression and disenfranchisement of women, when instead humans who cherry pick part of the section without reading the whole thing are the ones that should be blamed.

&gt;in my opinion the sentiment remains unpleasant because it suggests a social inequality between men and women

It does not. All it does is simply state that if your family is completely unable to agree on something, and you have met an impasse whereby both people are unable to agree with each other, then the woman should yield. Again, this is in the context of a christian family, so it can seem immoral to people who don't understand that as a whole. In a family that is correctly following the other parts of the bible, the occurrence of this (woman needing to yield to husbands choice) is very few and far between, because your focus is on Christ and his desires, and therefore your desires are much more in line than otherwise.",0,1403268329,null,0,false,0,cicfcqj,t3_28jj88,t1_cicfcqj,t1_cibvfa6,null,1434323127,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

But I can also sympathise with people who may need to travel often or with short notice for work or some sort of emergency. And I think that they should be able to rely on a decent time-line estimate to be able to plan accordingly.

It's not the length of time that's the issue, it's the unreliable estimate. If the passport office says, it'll take 3 months, then that's fine, the person knows that it is impossible to travel in the next 3 months and can make the necessary arrangements. But if the passport office says it'll take 3 weeks, but actually it'll take 6 weeks, then that's a big deal, because the person may be relying on that 3 week estimate for their job or for the sake of their loved ones or something like that.

People can fly pretty much any flag they want on their own property. To fly a flag on public property e.g. lampposts, you first need express permission from the owner. If it's the official flag of a nation, county, district, borough, burgh, parish, city, town or village you can display it. If it doesn't fall into one of those categories, then you also need separate approval from the council before it can be flown legally.

On top of that, according to [guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/15438/flying_flags_guide.pdf) from the Department for Communities and Local Government, all flags flown anywhere in the UK must:

&gt;• be maintained in a condition that does not impair the overall visual appearance of the site ; 

&gt; • be kept in a safe condition;

true,pharao007,null,null,"&gt;Benefit fraud amounts to just 0.7% of the welfare budget

Yeah, I saw that report and also made a comment then. We shouldn't really blindly trust in such government estimates. Why? Two reasons. First - governments are rarely ever happy to admit that problems do exist. Second - how on earth do they calculate how many people make benefit fraud? It's only an estimate and if it's based on some rubbish calculation it can be completely wrong.

Do you remember couple of weeks ago when government admitted they made a wrong analysis of immigrants coming into UK (from the EU) and that those numbers are most certainly higher? They didn't go to the airports, which were very popular among EU migrants, to do the polling. Just ridiculous. They could have asked few of those migrants if they also use other airports  and that would be enough to give them indication that maybe there is something wrong with our poll.

&gt;With that in mind, would you still advocate a change the the benefit system to prevent or reduce fraud?

Yes, there can still be done a lot to make sure benefit fraud doesn't happen. Simple things, like checking data between agencies or similar. I imagine these aren't used now because of something while they would be a very good start as I obviously do imagine that making it more harder for the actual claimants is not an actual and ideal solution as there of course are people who need benefits and shouldn't be stigmatised because of that.

&gt;If they are working more than 16 hours they won't be eligible for JSA, nor income support. 

But enough hours to get tax credits, housing and council tax benefit.

I think we are talking about different issues here. You focus on JSA, I talk about the above. Let's admit that you may not know everything about some benefits I know of and vice versa, however when I do claim there is something wrong with benefits I know, maybe I can actually be true?

&gt;Couples have to work 16 hours each to qualify for childcare and tax credits.

Read in details. Your link is ""childcare AND tax credits"", meaning most probably that you need to work to receive tax credits. Actual [child tax credit](https://www.gov.uk/child-tax-credit) - ""*you don’t need to be working to claim Child Tax Credit.*

So please, try to understand that I'm not really talking bollocks here and have some basis of my claim (in fact I've taken the Daily Mail to the PCC for the fact they lied in their articles - see my history). I obviously don't know everything but the general consensus in my view is that benefit system in Britain has too many holes and should be patched.",0,1403270595,null,0,false,0,cicg17r,t3_28gk1z,t1_cicg17r,t1_cic1ex6,null,1434323448,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Unexpected delays happen indeed. But the point is to be *unexpected*. If it's a systemic issue, where a large number of applications are getting significantly delayed, then there is something wrong, and either they need to get their act together, or increase the turn-around estimate to something actually realistic.

Every other process has set turn-around times, which they are expected to stick to, including getting visas from foreign governments. Why the hell should the passport office be exempt from this? If the manpower is just not enough, then by all means, increase the estimated turn-around time to 6 months if that's how long it may take!

I've lived in the US for a total of 11 years, before that I lived in the UK.  If you didn't have half-decent insurance, the healthcare system was indeed rather scary, the idea that you could be bankrupted through illness, etc.  However Obamacare really does fix much of that, by allowing anyone to get insurance regardless of ""pre-existing conditions"", indeed mandating that they do.

And healthcare in the US once you have insurance is actually pretty fucking good.  I needed some minor surgery a few years back - my mother flew over for it to make sure I was ok.  She was absolutely blown away by the hospital and overall experience, relative to what she was familiar with on the other side of the Atlantic.  Wifi in the very comfortable and private hospital room, a surgeon that took the time to explain what would happen, etc, etc.

And thank you for pointing out that those ludicrous bills are rarely what you actually end up paying, rather they are more of the opening offer in a negotiation with your insurance company.  Kind of stupid, but completely irrelevant in terms of what the patient needs to worry about.

It's important to note that since they have no European appointment, they'll have far less games this season. That's at least six less games, and likely more since they were likely to escape group play in either tournament. Therefore, that's considerably less opportunities to keep everyone happy.

If they go with a classic Dutch 4-3-3 or even a 4-2-3-1, RvP obviously plays the central role if fit. Rooney plays behind him as CAM or one of the wide forwards, but most likely CAM. So where does that leave Mata and Kagawa? Both players, if not playing centrally in these formats, play left winger/attacking mid. So why are they looking at another one? Obviously Depay would be better suited to a true 4-3-3 than either, but then you're still pushing two quality players to the bench.

The other possibility is van Gaal intends to use this new 5-3-2 he's been using at the WC. That would work well with having both RvP and Rooney. However, then you have nowhere for a left winger.

Why else would God give him final authority?. Is he so arbitary he just picked one gender at random (actually I'd be more inclined to believe an arbitary God existed than a forward-planning one)?

I'm afraid nothing you have said has changed my opinion that the verse, including the second part, places women in a secondary role and it therefore, as far as I'm concerned, suggests the woman is unequal to the man. It suggests men have some inherent moral superiority and that women must tolerate this. The husband may love and sacrifice of course (whatever that actually means, they are such vague terms) for the sake of the family but these are traditionally thought of as noble things, whereas submission is generally considered denigrating.

&gt;Again, this is in the context of a christian family, so it can seem immoral to people who don't understand that as a whole. In a family that is correctly following the other parts of the bible, the occurrence of this (woman needing to yield to husbands choice) is very few and far between, because your focus is on Christ and his desires, and therefore your desires are much more in line than otherwise.

It seems immoral no matter what the context, whether it is not meant to occur often or not is neither here nor there. The principle of it is immoral to me. Take the caste system in Hinduism as example, that is immoral because it is immoral, the context of whether it is Hindu or not does not matter. There is a Dharmic reason given for it of course but it is still abhorrent. Also of course I am an atheist so therefore I do not really have any common cause with the final part, although I would fundamentally disagree with any world view that is so prescriptive.

It says that at the end you would have paid £X amount but that the mortgage is still worth the same.  But this is a bit misleading because inflation would have eaten a lot of that.

For example, if it was a £100,000 mortgage for 25 years, then:


&gt; With an Interest Only mortgage your monthly repayment would be just £333 although after 25 years you will have paid £99,900 in interest and still owe your lender £100,000.

They've gotten this by doing:

£100000 * 0.04 * 25 = £100,000

But let's adjust it for inflation:

£100000 * 0.04 * (1 + (1-0.015) + .. + (1-0.015)^25))  = £100,000 * 0.04 * 20.9  = £83,600

So you would have actually only paid £83,600 in today's pound.

And interest would have eaten away at the mortgage, so that the mortgage would be only be worth £68,534 in today's money, a reduction of £31466.

So over the 25 years, you would have effectively paid £83,600 - £31466 = £52,134.  i.e  £173 per month is the amount that you're loosing.

This is much better than renting.

For example, if you're paying £1000 a month in rent currently, then you could switch to an interest-only mortgage for £500,000 and still be better off!

She applies for the passport, but she can't get one until the father of her eldest signs off on it. Considering he's a gypsy and has a history of addiction and abuse, finding him is a task, and actually getting consent from him will be even more difficult.

Whose fault is it? Obviously not hers for not planning ahead and figuring this out *before* she booked a holiday abroad that cost thousands of pounds, but the useless, incompetent wankers at the passport office who didn't prioritise *her* child's passport.

He then went on to explain how he stopped the energy from going all the way. It was diverted before it was ever allowed to complete the process, but the energy still had to go somewhere.

There's also the logic of it. He used one regeneration's worth of energy. That was enough to heal him and left enough to make a separate copy. Not only does regeneration not create an identical body in the first place, but if the Doctor actually fully regenerated into a new but identical body, he would not have had enough energy to siphon off to make a totally new body. To suggest otherwise implies that each single regeneration is actually enough to make two entire bodies.

Imagine a jug with enough water for one glass full. Once you start pouring the jug, you can't stop until the water's gone. A glass starts to be filled (the Doctor begins regenerating) but we don't want it filling to the top (he doesn't want there regeneration to finish), so instead we swap and put a second glass (the spare hand) under the jug so the rest of the water goes into that second glass. You still have the same amount of water between them though; you don't suddenly have two full glasses.

Baines didn't have any protection to get forward so we were forced down the right hand side of the pitch all the time. This, combined with only gerrard and hendo in the middle meant there was a huge gulf between attack and defence.

Hodgson had us sitting so so deep, so we ended up pinging it around the back 4 without imagination until cahill or jagielka booted it up the pitch, or one of the wingers came deep to get the ball. (99% sterling since every time we got the ball welbeck turned into a striker and stayed stood there until we had to defend a fucking corner.)

As soon as welbeck came off, surprise surprise, Lallana stayed wide and sat deeper than the person he replaced and we start getting more options to advance the ball in the way we want.

If two things were different from the start we could have won that match, Higher line (I know, cavani is fast, but the alternative lead to the shit performance we saw) and if not, a third midfielder to link up the team and use some of those acres of space that were in the middle of our team. The second is an actual wide player instead of a poor man's daniel sturridge, standing next to daniel sturridge for half the game.

Also, in the first game he was the cause of our defeat. Everyone talks about rooney on the left and how he wasn't tracking back. However, by the end of the second half he had been doing a fairly decent job, combined with gerrard and baines, of closing down candreva and tracking back with baines.

 The problem we get is that welbeck on the opposite side has fuck all to do due to italy wanting candreva on the ball. The few times he had to track back he didn't and forced sterling over to that side and even a few times danny sturridge had to retreat to our byline to defend. This meant that when hodgson got in at half time and thought ""how do we solve this problem on the left, AH! EUREKA! Welbeck has done a good job on the right, if we swap wings he can deal with candreva and we can let wayne loose on the other side""

And lowe and behold after a decent ten minutes in possession, Italy's first real attack of the second half saw them storm down the left hand side, saw welbeck jogging back from the half way line as baines, and consequently, our whole back line was dragged to the left to cover the danger and bang, ballotelli header at the far post.

http://labourlist.org/2014/06/full-text-ed-milibands-speech-to-the-launch-of-ipprs-condition-of-britain-report/

Here's the IPPR paper, and I'll link directly to the most relevant section which Ed cited:

In short Ed proposed:

&gt; for 18 to 21 year olds, we will replace Job Seekers’ Allowance with a new youth allowance, an allowance dependent on young people being in training.    
&gt; Assessed on the basis of parental income    
&gt; make sure that someone who has been working for years and years, paying in to the system, gets more help if they lose their job, than someone who has been working for just a couple of years

Overall his proposal sounds to me like something that wouldn't look out of place in a Conservative briefing, so when Fraser comes out guns blazing and claims:   
&gt; It’s radical, tough, assertive – and utterly misjudged   

I'd expect a justification for that.  Sadly this never arrives, and we're left with a meandering discussion of tangential und unrelated points.

As a self-employed person you will have to file a self assessment tax return and that tax return will encompass all your finances, not just the business (i.e. it'll include declaring your income from your employer and other sources like savings and so on - you'll have to gather all this information at tax time to go on the forms).

In theory it's possible to DIY rather than using an accountant but unless the business is tiny and very simple it's probably better to use one - a good accountant can ""earn"" their fee by pointing out deductions that you, as a non-expert, might completely miss.  It's also probably worth getting an accountant involved sooner rather than later. You'll need to keep records and provide them to your accountant. The better state you can keep your records in during the year the less stress both you and your accountant are likely to have at year end, and the less you will pay them for sorting out your mess rather than using their expertise to save you money!",0,1403276317,null,0,false,0,cicia8y,t3_28n5l0,t1_cicia8y,t3_28n5l0,null,1434324507,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

This is probably why Farage and UKIP are reluctant to put out a detailed manifesto until as late as possible - the old UKIP voters clearly support and want the racist policies, but the new uneducated and ignorant votes Farage picked up during the approach to the May elections would be disenfranchised by such policies, right when the party is trying to distance itself from an unfortunate few racists.

&gt;Overall his proposal sounds to me like something that wouldn't look out of place in a Conservative briefing

In a caricature of a Tory briefing, I'd say. This kind of sums up my problem with this kind of position- given that it's now mandatory to be in some form of training until the age of 18, this more or less extends that period to 21, unless the individuals concerned are in a position where they can support themselves while they find a job *without* jobseekers' allowance. It actively punishes people looking for work. 

It adds to the growing assumption that people are expected to live with their parents into their twenties. This is horrible- should independence be something that's only available to kids going to university with a student loan?

But a player like Depay also would be a ""investment"" player in that he is young enough that you could have him on the squad without guaranteeing him a starting role this season and would be able to develop him to take over for in a season or so.  He is a young, very talented player who is already familiar with LvG and his system so it is a reasonable thought that they would be interested.

Plus for all we know with the presumed changes that will be going on at United a player like Kagawa may be shipped out (along with the ilk of Young, Valencia, Nani)...depends on what LvG thinks of him.

It removes responsibility for the welfare of inmates, and their rehabilitation, training... all the stuff that *should* happen in a prison, and puts it in the hands of people with a profit motive for keeping costs down. The best way to keep those costs down is to not deliver those services, or at least use the cheapest methods possible, not the best methods possible. 

At the risk of arguing semantics, Bob (and his employees) are very much *not* government employees. They may be acting in a role one would expect to be a govt role, but they are very much employees of Serco/G4S not Her Majesty's Prison Service. 

I don't like purely private prisons for a number of reasons, but mostly because they rarely work at any level beyond keeping people in. There was a study done on recidivism in the US private vs state/federal prisons which showed a higher rate of recidivism in privately owned prisons. (I'll try and find it later and link to it)

I also have issues with the government having all the up-front costs, then just handing private companies profitable contracts. The best reason I've got for doing this was that employees essentially have far fewer rights under G4/Serco than they would if they were employed by HMPS - it strikes me that the better solution would be to fix the problems with HMPS contracts and regulations, rather than adding a layer of cost which a well-run government prison shouldn't have.

Even out of general taxation, the UK spends around 18% of our £720bn budget on healthcare. So if we assume that 18% of your tax goes to the NHS, we can work out how much you'd need to earn to pay £1050/month towards the NHS. That figure would be north of £100k/yr.

I don't think we'll sell Townsend despite any interest. He's young, a Spurs academy lad, pacey, English, highly ambidextrous, and fearless. Such a combination is very rare today, so I think the club will try to hold on to him and especially since he possesses the kind of raw talent Poch likes to mold (and also because he prefers the inverted ilk of winger). 

Lennon however, is significantly older, looks very much like he needs a change in scenery, and is very much a traditional winger. At the age of 27, and given the potential and hunger shown in two players five years younger in need of development, it also makes sense to move an older and out-of-place player (mentally and tactically) on to allow those two players game time.

Data logging
We do not log which websites you visit (though the website administrator may). We don't run any sort of transparent proxies or other systems to covertly log what you do on the internet, and do not sell data to anyone. We have no, so called, black boxes which monitor traffic for the government, or anyone else. We specifically monitor traffic levels and make this available to you. If we are helping you debug a problem we can monitor traffic for you in real time, but we don't keep that data. All of our servers which you use (e.g. email, web servers, VoIP, etc.) have logs which are kept for a few months, but you do not have to use our servers if you do not want to. We don't log the content of VoIP calls, though you can ask us to make call recordings (which we email to you), as can the person you are talking to (using our services or someone else's), so best to assume calls might be recorded. We keep PPP negotiation logs for a few months too, for debugging line and router issues. Some servers have diagnostic logs that hold some data for a few days (e.g. SIP control traffic) for debugging, but only relevant if you use our servers. We have not yet been required to retain communications data for 12 months under the Data Retention Directive, so we don't. We do not run anything like Phorm, and never will.",0,1403279762,null,0,false,0,cicjvs8,t3_28mvtk,t1_cicjvs8,t1_cicjbhb,null,1434325272,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

Can you suggest a communist area for comparison?

For people like me a computer is often enough to allow me to be very productive in a medium I wouldn't otherwise be able to use.  This is also true for a lot of mobility impaired.

However freelancing has changed the shift style working, helping those who are unable to face the classic long working pattern to be productive too.

Given the constrain of supporting those who are net consumers, it's best we try to limit the number of them.  Now Hitler had a mechanism for doing that, which wasn't productive long term see the number of people who are afflicted by certain things growing still today.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I think we're both arguing different things.  The military is a national organisation, soldiers are trained by the government, and the Ministry of Defence and our armed forces are THE military of the UK.  Now let's say the Navy wants to build a new ship, so they hire a shipyard and a shipbuilding company to design and build it, and then manage that operation.  That doesn't mean the Navy has been Privatised, even though the shipbuilding company is making a profit on the boat, in the same way that the Space Shuttle being built by a private company doesn't mean NASA hasn't been privatised.  A *nationalised* service has simply hired a private company to *run* one of its programs or properties.   The prison operating company does not own the prison, it is a government 'employee' that can have its contract terminated.

I think what you are (quite rightly) arguing against is the issues that come with hiring said private companies to run public prisons, when they are of course aiming to make money.  However there is immense pressure in councils, the NHS and many other 'fully nationalised' organisations to save money as well.  It is not unique to private companies.  Indeed because the private company can be kicked out if it gets too much bad press or if a government comes in that doesn't like the job they're doing, they are arguably less complacent than a council group, who often have almost 100% job and role security.

If you have a top player with technical skill and flair to the point where it's a matter of when he'll score or go around you and not ""if,"" then you need to limit his time on the ball and limit the mental freedom he has. To get in his head you need to make sure he is thinking of you and not the goal or the ball. You do this by tackling him--fairly, since you can't go a man down--which will make him look for you first rather than the at the goal. If a history of injury makes him even more mentally uncertain, even better.  You don't need to injure Suarez, you just need him to think of you first or make him worry about his own injury. If, in the process, you keep him from getting the ball (which is a nearly impossible task), then that's even better. Suarez thrives on time and space, and making sure you stay tight and physical gives him neither.

This is not a hard concept. This is literally a different way of saying the old ""rainy night in Stoke"" criticism that all top flair players face. Honestly, Wilkins talking about seeing if the knee was ""legit"" is no different, in my mind, then taking someone like Robben and only giving him the right side and testing his weak foot.

You must know that, surely. This isn't the ""rainy night in Stoke"" because that's just tough-tackling, this is purposely targeting a player who has recently had surgery in an attempt to see if you can anger or worsen that knee to the point where Suarez can not play like his usual self.

They can be a good starting point for discussion - what to do, what side effects might we see, or they can be little more than attack pieces that push an agenda.  In this case he found something where he could have written a good pro-Conservative piece asking why change to Labour if they're just adjusting Conservative offering slightly, and showing how Conservative policies have succeeded, but that opportunity was missed.

As far as people being forced to live with their parents longer - unless the housing stock increases this has to happen.  Until you're earning good money you can't afford the bills, deposit, etc.  Unless the reality of this changes, it seems sensible to me that other policies should be written on this basis, regardless of whether we like it or consider it fair.",0,1403283606,null,0,false,0,ciclsck,t3_28n2eh,t1_ciclsck,t1_cicit94,null,1434326169,1,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1

A huge amount of British stuff is historical drama (which in our country UNLIKE America is dominated entirely by white people until about 1960), reality shows which are less about acting and more about finding weird and stupid communities to film (and given 90% of Britain is white are naturally going to have more white people), or various documentaries about the history of railways or the relationship between flowers and trees or wild buffalo or Asian wildlife, and unfortunately the vast vast majority of our academics are white.

Thus, the angels couldn't come out of the paper. So I can accept that.

Another thing I have a problem with is their movement, like I said. But even more, in some cases they creep and others cases they move exceptionally fast. And aside from dramatic television reasons, that makes little sense. And in some cases, they basically teleport. In Flesh and Stone, the crew is in the ship with the angels outside siphoning enough energy to get the door open, and the lights go out for about a second and when they come back on, all 4 angels are inside and the door is closed behind them. We never heard it open or close, they literally just appeared inside. If they have that power, that's fine with me. But then, it undermines their other movement.

Also, clearly, angels can see in the dark, because they turn off light sources so others can't see them so they can move. But if they can see in the dark, then they can see each other move!! And based on the basic rule or their origin/concept set in Blink, that they are a bunch of molecules until seen and then they freeze into stone, they should not be able to move in packs in the dark because they can see each other.

**Best**

1. Bryan Ruiz - Superb in the first half, set up a good chance and stuck away the only goal of the match.

2. Capmbell -  Should have had a penalty and never stopped running at that Italian defence right up until he was subbed. 

3. Duarte - One of the many defenders who kept Ballotelli at bay. 

**Worst**

1. Buffon - Poor from the very first touch. Looked a shadow of the legend here, along with the rest of his players. 

2. Ballotelli - Missed a vital chance in the first chance, could have had another, and then dropped off in the second and became more and more frustrated. 

3. Candreva - Did very little, along with all of the other players.

Actually, it pretty much is.

From your list #1 is really the only requirement. You do need to register with HMRC as a sole trader, and you need to do it well in advance of the tax return submission date of October (for offline) or January (for online). It takes a few weeks for them to set you up, and you'll want some wiggle room on the off chance that something is wrong with your registration.

And that is pretty much it. Congrats, you are now a registered sole trader.

Using a business account is definitely not required, and adds an unnecessary expense for a fledgling business. Using a separate (non-business) account from your personal account will definitely make tracking incomings and outgoings easier, but it's not a requirement. I've been completely self employed for 4 years as a web developer using my personal bank account and personal credit cards. As long as you keep a record of everything (invoices, receipts, downloaded digital copies of statements) and can prove to HMRC that particular transactions were done in the course of your business if they ask then you're fine. Basically, record everything. Get some Excel spreadsheets going that track everything you receive and spend in relation to the business.

Hiring an accountant is also not required. Self Assessment for sole traders with ""normal"" levels of income is a piece of cake, especially for someone with a developer background. When you come to file your return online there are lots of helpful guides on the HMRC site, and if you're unsure of anything there is usually always an answer you can find with some Googling. If you are currently employed under PAYE then that adds a tiny bit of complexity to your return, but it's still nothing more than some simple maths and putting the correct numbers in the correct boxes on each page. The accountant is really a choice - if you have no interest in doing your returns and you're happy to spend the money then hire one to help you out.",0,1403288151,null,0,false,0,cico3xg,t3_28n5l0,t1_cico3xg,t3_28n5l0,null,1434327264,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2

true,Daltesse,lfc12,,"The biggest complaint about Hodgson is his lack of tactical nous. In a world cup in a tropical rainforest he decided that 2 players would cover the whole midfield and one of them had just turned 34!

As for Defoe and Cole neither should have been there he made the right call, he should also have dropped Lampard from the squad and brought Carrick instead. 

Against Italy, he should have played 4-3-3. Started with a midfield of Milner - Gerrard - Henderson. Stevie drops deep Milner presses the right side and Jordan the left. Milner and Henderson push up on Italy. Front 3 of Sterling behind Rooney and Studge who run the channels but can, if needed turn to 2 wide and one in the middle. 

Costa Rica have proven that pressing and then keeping and using the ball intellegently against both Italy and Uruguay was what was required. Roy although not a long ball merchant is a direct type of manager who needs to get the ball forward as fast as possible which suited the opposition as England tired themselves out doing all the chasing.

He rarely deviates from his preferred formation and when things are not going well, has really poor in game management.

Mata is so light with short legs he'll never be good at defending no matter how hard he tries.  Cesc is by no means big, but he's more average sized which is a relative advantage over Mata.

Not at all, Mata is one of the best set-piece takers in the leauge and had a great shot on him. Fabregas doesn't come close to Mata in this regard.

&gt; Dribbling ability: Fabregas &gt; Mata

And again, no. Mata is the better dribbler. Fabregas can't compare when it comes to dribbling through people like Mata can. I am not sure if you watched him at Barcelona at all, but he rarely tried to dribble through people.


&gt; Speed: Mata = Fabregas

Neither are very pacey (sprint wise) but over the length of a few yards Mata definitely has Fabregas beat.

Fabregas however is better defensively than Mata (but not a great defender himself). A better long range passer (but Mata is great as well but Fabregas is slightly better and when playing in a deeper position has the opportunity to use it more often). He is more physical, **but** you are kidding your self if you think he is anywhere near the likes the of Matic or David Luiz when it comes to physicality, for example, strength, pace or heading/jumping.

When you encounter someone who does something you think is strange, and it's protected just 'because of religion', there's almost certainly an argument you've failed to grasp (probably something involving 'freedom', like 'freedom' to cover your face or teach your children to pray). 

The only alternative is a bigoted view argued by idiots (ie ""look at them, they can do that just because of their religion!"") or someone with a stake in the game (ie another religious follower, even from a different faith) is making the argument.

While I want to live in a world where mankind leaves religion by the wayside, I don't want to live in a world that forces people to do it. So unless there's an actual god damn reason why something someone does is harming someone else, they can do whatever the fuck they like.

Wander out to South Queensferry, see the Forth Rail Bridge and treat yourself to lunch or dinner at the Orocco Pier. 

London - Head down to the South West of the city and check out the Natural History Museum and the V&amp;A. Go East and wander round Whitechapel, maybe take a Ripper tour, check out some of the little galleries, find your way to Brick Lane for awesome curry. In the centre, hang around Covent Garden, do a backstage tour at one of the theatres, stroll along the Embankment, visit the National Gallery and/or the Portrait Gallery, shop on Piccadilly and Regent Street, check out the cinema at Leicester Square. The restaurants at the National Theatre are very good. 

Bath - Check out the Roman Baths, have tea at Sally Lunn's. 

Florence - The Palazzo Vecchio and the Uffizi gallery are both amazing, but be sure to book in advance or you'll spend all day in a queue. Or just get a coffee at Caffe Rivoire and sit in the Piazza della Signoria. Check out the Duomo, the Medici palace and the Boboli Gardens. Amazing ice cream can be found at Vivoli on Via Isola delle Stinche.

So in my view, we have 2 players who performed similarly - Lallana being ever so slightly better. The other condition is that Borini ('91) is 3 years younger than Lallana ('88), more room to develop and mature even a little bit.

What can be done about this? Encouraging more people from this section of society to get into this field. And acknowledging that there is a problem, so that the discrimination can be stamped out.

But the nuts and bolts: *""Cancer survival in Britain the worst in Europe""* and their conclusion *""The results of this large study on cancer survival are likely to be reliable.""* Though they do go on to point out a few caveats. 

Within the NHS itself there is acceptance amongst doctors that UK cancer survival rates are poor. It was because of that the ""2 week rule"" was introduced - under which GPs can refer certain patients to hospital outpatient clinics for investigation of suspected cancers within 2 weeks. 

But unfortunately they often get missed before getting to their GP. It is particularly bad for things like gastrointestinal cancers and lymphomas because they can reach significant sizes and spread far before causing specific symptoms. Often people just complain of vague non-specific things like tiredness, changes in the bowel habit etc. 

The reasons why are complicated and extremely multifactoral. They include things we can't influence easily - like our diet, smoking and drinking habits. They also include things we can do things about like our reluctance to investigate non-specific symptoms early, and the philosophy within general practice where people tend to ""Watch and Wait"", whereas in the US being more market driven means physicians are keen to demonstrate that they can fix patients symptoms... otherwise those patients will vote with their wallets for another physician who can. It means UK secondary care has a diametrically opposed ethos compared to the USA. The real hard truth probably lies somewhere between the two systems - like France and Germany have, where there is a degree of state national health provision particularly in hospitals, but GPs tend to be private enterprises (not like the centrally planned pseudo-private/state funded operations they are in the UK). It means instead of having people who say things like *""Christ my GP is a really shit and doesn't listen to me""* they just move to a different practice and pay someone else, in the same way you might change internet provider.

That's certainly a consideration. Fair enough. We need to think of a church, perhaps. 

&gt;The convicted pair knew this and did what they did to cause maximum offence. 

I will accept this. Highly likely. But again, we must be careful of the implications of criminalising offence rather than harm. 

&gt;If they had thrown a bit of bacon at a Muslim in the street 12 months would be a bit but for a pre-meditated plan to just cause offence I feel these people deserved it. 

Here i respectfully disagree because i am a strong liberal favouring the criminalising of harm rather than offence. I am willing to be offended so long as real harm is prevented. But that's just me. The implications however are not just me and can be thought about objectively. 

I would have expected a fine on a first offence, but I'm no lawyer. 

&gt;Plus one of them being a member of SDL points to this being a blatant racist attack. 

This sdl membership is a terribly dangerous consideration to bear on the penalty. If the sdl is legal it is legal. Otherwise prosecute membership. I don't know what sdl is. I'm aware racist motive is a special offence in law. My personal opinion is it should not be because it makes no difference to the harm. In this case, however, i an see that racist motive should perhaps have some bearing on sentencing, but not that much. 

&gt; I'm glad these people will be off Scotland's streets for a year.

Because you don't like them?

I'm glad when the laws based on preventing harm are applied impartially.

The fact is that tackling a player or being physical is a tactic. And with that in min, half of the battle is mental rather than physical. I don't at all think Wilkins is saying England should try to hurt Suarez, but he wants to test his mobility and his mental toughness. You don't want to unfairly tackle Suarez, because you'll be punished for it. You want him to be thinking about you.

As any honest pollster will tell you, these types of 'what if' polls are complete and utter wank. Probably best to just quote Anthony Wells from YouGov verbatim here, in reference to Oakeshott's leaked polls, which appeared to show that the Lib Dems would do much better under Vince Cable:

&gt; That aside, how would you vote if X was leader are incredibly crude tools. When a would-be leader is little known to the public they are as good as useless. Even when the would-be leader is relatively well known to the public, like Gordon Brown was pre-2007 or Vince Cable is now, they are of dubious use.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Essentially, an ordinary poll respondent who doesn’t closely follow politics might know what the would-be leader looks and sounds like, might have a pre-existing positive or negative view, they might have a vague perception of competence or incompetence. What they don’t know is what policies that new leader would announce, what direction they’d take the party, how the media would react to them and so on.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; If the Liberal Democrats change leader it probably won’t be the personality and image of the new leader that makes the difference… it will be everything else that comes with it. Would it mean them leaving the coalition? Would it mean them repudiating the coalition and their role in it? Would it mean them opposing some of the policies they supported until now? And what would be the impact of that – would it win back supporters they’ve lost, or risk alienating their pro-coalition supporters too? While the departure of Nick Clegg may be a requirement for a change of direction, the big strategic question for the Lib Dems is really what attitude they take to their record in government – not which politician is voicing it.

I have known personally a person who walked from a charge (not even remotely rape related) with an aquittal whom I personally knew was guilty of the accused crime.

The standards of a justice system must, at all time, accept a requirement that proof beyond reasonable doubt is required. That does not reflect at all though, on matters of personal opinions, of the experience of victims (alleged or otherwise) , or on the interpersonal relationships people have.

I was never the direct victim of the crime committed against my mother, though I remained an interested party. The man involved was arrested several times and finally charged with harassment inciting a fear of violence after several, reportable, and documented cases of threats to kill, following an arrest without charge for assault against her. The district judge found him acquitted because we did not provide to him a credible proof of fear of violence.

While I accept the judgement of the judge as having merit in a broader social context, and would intellectually accept that judgement, I know as a matter of fact due to direct experience the status of his guilt.

We do not understand the personal factors in this case. We do not know the persons involved. We do not know who witnessed what, who was involved, and the minutiae of the case as presented in court. 

Though, to the extent of the justice system as it stands, the finding of the trial has legitimacy, we cannot wantonly assume that the position of this woman is without grounds beyond that.

Social perception and understand extends beyond the limited confines of the law. What can be proved is not the same as what occurred. What people believe is not so simple as the happenings of a courtroom.

I can now backup the fact that a robot or an affiliate indeed submitted my information to your site. While your company have been whitewashing all of this information away for some strange reason.

My first evidence is the fact that creditmaze.co.uk's IP address is 188.65.179.75 - there is one domain currently on this server, suggesting that it is a dedicated IP address just for Credit Maze: http://www.200please.com/ip/188.65.179.75

My second bit of evidence is a German site that hasn't updated it's records in a while. It shows that creditmaze.co.uk's IP address was also a DNS server for ipaffiliate. ns2.ipaffiliate.co.uk - here is the website: http://whois.gwebtools.de/ipaffiliate.co.uk - it no longer is!

My fourth bit of evidence is the fact that you have tried to whitewash this and close your site to new requests. If I do a dig at your DNS server for google.com, it doesn't respond and says it's not handling recursive DNS requests. (As is proper protocol, your admins are good) - however if I dig for ns2.ipaffiliate.co.uk it will come back with something I've put at the bottom of this email.

In essence, that's true in terms of a communist State too; however, there is a wing of the left movement which has attempted to go via the State socialist route (with all the problems that the libertarians predicted eventually coming to pass - in fact, they came to pass pretty rapidly).  

I'd argue that the major reasons for the failures and ultimate defeat of the anarchist movements in Catalonia and Ukraine were, in fact, external (Soviet Stalinism kowtowing to Western liberal 'democracies'' insistence on an end to the anarchist experiment, German and Italian sponsored fascism, etc.), although there's no doubt that local Spanish Soviet-sponsored Stalinists and Franco's fascists were the ones with their hands on the triggers.  Where I do agree though (surprise!), is that before we ever ask people to make those sorts of sacrifices for a glorious revolution of _any_ kind again, we better be damn sure that we pick the right one and that we can defend it.

Some people can put you together an ecommerce web site for £500. All they're doing is taking a template they've used before changing a few CSS properties (colours, fonts), popping in your logo and handing it over to you to put in your product descriptions and images. If you're cool with that then go for it. bare in mind you will get very few extra features and if you want anything fancy - emails, categories, reviews, maps, product configurations, despatch tracking etc. you'll have to pay extra and potentially the person you originally hired may not have the expertise to fulfil all of your requests.

If you want anything unique you will have to pay for it. If you want to be found on the search engines you will need to work hard read up on SEO or pay someone for it.


Here's a couple of things to be wary of:

* Anyone who promises first page results in Google is lying
* Hosting costs - the quality/speed of the server you use and the speed of the internet connection of that server will affect the speed of your site and how many users it can support simultaneously
* Bandwidth limits - cheaper hosts may impose limits on the bandwidth you can use each month, ensure you know what you're getting and what the charges are if you grow.
* Costs for changes - ongoing maintenance and changes in content/design are where software developers make their money make sure you know the hourly rate for changes also beware that most devs will charge for 1 hour minimum so even changing 1 image can cost you £75+ if that's their hourly rate.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I think that's the inherent problem with revolutions though- you sweep away everything and hope what comes afterwards is better.  It's like a blind man sitting at the end of a body of water of undetermined size and deciding to swim into it because something great could lie on the other side.  And while I think those leaps of faith can be admirable, a revolution drags everyone in a country along with it.   The postman, the baker, the factory owner, the priest, the soldier, they're all affected.  And that's why I think measured change through the democratic system will always be more effective than revolution.  

The advantage of Liberal democracy is, I find, that despite some excesses and some issues (ie property law, minimal unemployment benefit etc..), we generally let people get on with their lives.  The state exists to protect and enforce laws that I'd argue most people generally agree with (laws of the sort that have existed for thousands of years like no killing, along with newer laws that are adapted to modern society), and to provide a safety net, along with some other socially valid stuff like supporting culture, and otherwise (generally) stays out of people's way.  

I like that way of operating personally.  Technically, an anarchist or communist society would work in a similar way- the state would be minimal or non-existent, and people would be left to their devices.  However, I personally find it hard to believe that a mass group of people would ascend to power, implement their changes, and then simply give up power voluntarily.  To me this is the fundamental flaw of Marxism, it neglects our desire for power, a desire that transcends greed or empathy or any of the other things we feel.  

For that reason I cannot support Leftist movements.  Upheaval with what is historically a 0% chance of long term success in 30+ attempts is simply not a risk I am prepared to take.  The chance of death, destruction, totalitarianism and economic collapse is too high.

Telegraph poles belong to utilities, usually BT... you'll get the exact same response though.

A few guys were arrested for painting the kerbs, the Roads service was asked if they wanted to press charges but they said no, again for the safety of their staff members.

That said, he would have been a Blair mk 2, the real-life Dan Miller, and while he would have been completely electable from an image point of view I think he'd have also kept Labour's standing firmly in the Blair pocket. Unfortunate as it sounds, image is pretty much everything these days. JFK has a lot to answer for!

What I really hope to see from Milibean is a good, solid manifesto that appeals to the socialists (stop selling off the NHS, renationalise the railways amd telecoms) but still caters in some regards to the neolibs (the benefits reform he talked about today would probably be the best way forward, though I personally have my doubts about that particular policy). By getting a decent manifesto in soon he may well be able to overwhelm the ""oh look at him, dun't 'e look weird"" reaction.

Of course there's always the problem that if you publish a manifesto too early it gives the opposition more time to pull it apart, but the defensiveness of British politicians has been an issue for years. Plus there's a very real risk that ""too much too soon"" could turn him into another Michael Foot (still galls me that he didn't win in 1983, but then it woz teh Falklands wot won it, rather than anything meaningful from Thatcher and her boys).

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"See, I'm a revolutionary in the sense that I don't believe that there's any compromise to be had with capitalism.  Capitalism needs to be defeated and to pass away.  The idea that it's the best thing that will ever exist or could ever exist is palpable nonsense and based on mass propaganda.  It's a wholly repugnant economic system based on massive exploitation, and has led to the deaths of many hundreds of millions, probably billions, and certainly magnitudes more than the leftist revolutions against it.  It will be considered by our descendants much the same as we consider slave societies, if not far worse.

So capitalism will have to be defeated, and that tiny minority which capitalism privileges will not give up their privilege without a fight.  In fact, they will obviously use much of their wealth and the political, cultural and ultimately military power that it buys to prevent it: first by subterfuge and manipulation, but eventually by naked force and extreme violence.

On the other hand, I'm principally a revolutionary in the sense that change has to be radical and comprehensive, it doesn't necessary have be violent, ideally it should be consensual and we should plan for it.  We should build a new society in the shell of the old - and I'm always more in favour of creation and creative destruction than destruction for its own sake.  This is most readily apparent in regions where capitalism collapses of its own accord, as it has done in many places and at many times, although there is always the danger of fascism at these junctures (especially where the left is weak or uncoordinated).  

Revolution could come through disruptive technologies which undermine the sources of profit and exploitation, that'd be good, but the problem is such technologies are suppressed and destroyed where they cannot be contained and controlled and exploited themselves.

You claim revolution had historically had 0% success, and yet what of the French revolution which brought us democracy and the capitalism you seem to cherish (and it was an improvement on feudalism), what of the American revolution?

In the Saville case lack of anonymity was certainly useful for making the case gain momentum and ensure conviction, even posthumously, and I do agree that there has been good coverage of this young man's innocence.

However, I would point out that an offender as prolific as Saville is the rarest of exceptions, not the rule. Basing the system around an exceptional bastard is not necessarily the best way of ensuring justice. 

The law must be in the business of punishing those who cause harm but not to the extent that it creates victims itself. This is a particular problem with sexual offences. More often than not in court sex offences are a case of two competing stories and, although the law contains many caveats to attempt to overcome this problem, the nature of such evidence does not lend itself to proving beyond reasonable doubt. People are aware of this problem and thus, despite not even being charged, a widely publicised accusation of rape will still go a long way to destroying a man's reputation. Being innocent does not always help once the accusation is levelled. 

Until confidence in legal procedure relating to sex offences is restored I think anonymity is necessary, at least until the point of charge. The likes of Saville are, thankfully, so phenomenally rare that I firmly believe such a policy would provide a more just system overall.

true,LocutusOfBorges,,Liberal Democrat | /r/LibDem,"The issue with the ""appealing to the neolibs"" point's that it's not just a question of appealing to some nebulous ""Thatcherite"" voting bloc- any figure fighting to be heard in that sense has to fight against the weight of a national consensus that's been steadily embedding itself into society since *1979*. 

The only ""radical"" opinions any party can reasonably speak about openly in the contemporary political arena are those that fit into the (relatively) limited spectrum of opinions available in the service of the status quo. 

It's not even the sort of thing that can be explained away, as the Marxists tend to, as ""Capital"" exerting its power- it's a media-led phenomenon. If a view isn't ""prudent"", the media establishment will leap upon it like a pack of wolves- with the opposing party joining in with barely-concealed glee. 

That's why, personally, I think Ed Miliband was the wrong choice. He's not even presented anything particularly controversial to the public so far- but the media's constructed the conception of his *being* ""radical"", ""left wing"" and controversial, and that's not an image that can be dispelled without a PR miracle- which Ed, given his mediocre public speaking skills and reputation for craven politicking, isn't really all that well-placed to provide. 

He was screwed the moment the media and certain sections of the party decided to paint him as the ""Left"" candidate. David, in all likelihood, wouldn't have been all that different- perhaps with a greater focus on localism, maybe. But the impact on public opinion would have been spectacular- at least, compared with the current situation. The man was seen as Blairite- and, as we've seen, that perception wins elections. If it weren't for Iraq, Blair could quite easily have still been in power now- the man was untouchable because *he knew how to deal with the system*.

Miliband doesn't seem to have grasped that. He's followed the narrative, rather than defining it- and on the occasions where he *does* define it, he does so poorly, and ends up being ignored.

It's a tragedy. But it really wouldn't be helped by ditching Miliband for Balls.",0,1403307922,null,0,false,0,cicx6zs,t3_28o18i,t1_cicx6zs,t1_cicwikh,null,1434331610,2,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,2

Like with Amy in the forest, she couldn't see them but they froze anyway because they were scared. So when try realized they weren't actually being seen the started moving again but cautious because they weren't sure and were still scared. 

As for the speed changes, do you sprint everywhere you go? I generally took it to mean they were walking over running or sprinting, and when they went slow enough that the drama was there they were just confidently strolling forward, and screwing with everyone. angelbob said they sometimes did stuff that scared people just for fun, like Amy's counting. You've gotta remember they aren't just amazing creatures, they're people, with society and personality. 

The door scene was pretty clear, watch again and you'll see plenty of time for the door to open and close and I thought I heard it when I saw it just now, they were doing that angel quick move sound at the time but I think I heard a clank.

It's estimated that less than 1% of rapes end in someone going to prison (only 1/10 are reported to the police to begin with). 

E.g. look at operation Yewtree - 16 arrests, 600 potential victims (450 by Saville). The police have pursued 400 lines of inquiry. There has only been one conviction. So far 10 people who were arrested have been acquitted or not prosecuted for lack of evidence. That begs the question - Do we have hundreds of people falsely accusing random celebrities of rape(possibly for compensation)? 

My point is that just because someone isn't convicted for rape, does not mean we have to believe they are innocent. We have to treat them like they are innocent, but you have to bear in mind how hard it is to convict someone of rape.

true,LocutusOfBorges,,Liberal Democrat | /r/LibDem,"&gt;I guess that within the media and entertainment businesses the scarcity of non-whites may simply be down to the parents saying ""Why the hell would you want to be an actor? Get a proper job FFS!""

Oh, lord. Yes. I know that sentiment well. 

The stereotype of South Asian parental treatment of career aspirations has a fair amount of truth behind it, I've found.

""*My dear, you can be anything you want to be- as long as it's a doctor, lawyer, mathematician, engineer or housewife.*""

It's funny how things like that turn into statistically significant demographic trends. 

…Although, the set of people that will go for an acting career are very much self-selecting. Henry's not just talking about Afro-Caribbean talent- he's talking about the lot. That adds up to a fairly significant subset of the population at large- there are still plenty of non-white kids that decide they might want to go into media. 

Talent's also a concern, of course. But it's surprising there haven't been a few more successful non-white comedians out there than we've seen so far- proportionally, they're way down from where they should be, proportionally. The only one that springs to mind's Omid Djalili- and his act's very, very targeted towards non-white audiences. 

He's extremely good, at his best- but it'd be nice to see some more comedians from non-Anglo-Saxon/Irish backgrounds in the limelight. 

But, I really don't have a clue how many non-white comedians are out there at the moment. Racism will still provide a fairly significant barrier to general acceptance, but it's not quite insurmountable.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The American revolution was a political revolution, not a social one.  The economic system did not change in the US, and unless you were a loyalist you were welcome to keep your property.  The French Revolution could be described as an economic one, but the fact is that France had been moving towards capitalism for two centuries and despite the bloodshed and economic damage the revolution caused, the same wealthy industrial bourgeoisie who had been powerful before the revolution remained powerful after it.  

As for your earlier paragraphs, I think they are so comprehensively ignorant of the historical realities of the past century and a half it's hard to know where to begin.   The life of the average homo sapien has never been more comfortable, more safe, and more healthy than it is today.  If you look at history, the progress of the human race (in terms of quality of life, or technological change, or 'progress' generally really) stayed at 0 for about a million years, shot up radically upon the invention of civilization, and then climbed slowly for about 7,000 years until the end of the renaissance/age of enlightenment, where it began a spike that continues to this very day.  In everything from childhood mortality to access to food and clean water, to rates of murder and death the statistics have gotten radically better.  

While direct causation can be argued over (though the evidence is significant), the fact is that that 'spike' coincides precisely with the introduction of capitalism.  As the system became more and more free progress has only gotten faster.  

Even today, it is far from the 'few' who benefit from Capitalism.  40 years ago under Communist regimes, the vast majority of Chinese were poor farmers, labouring away for 15 hours a day on Collective Farms, under the whip of one of the most oppressive governments in history, one forged in the fires of a Marxist Revolution.    Today, the average wealth of a Chinese person has shot up.  Though their conditions may still be bad compared to ours, access to food, housing, consumer goods and even the quality of state-owned services like healthcare, has shot up unimaginably.   Objectively, the average Chinese citizen has a far higher quality of life today than before 1970.  Unsurprisingly, the spike in living standards coincides with the introduction of free market capitalism, as it has in Vietnam, East Germany, Poland and many other countries.   

How you can despise a system that has brought you so much comfort (from medicine developed by capitalist companies to the computer or phone you're typing this on, to the food you eat), including this very website itself, which by the way is owned by Capitalist Corporation Conde Nast, seems very strange.    Millions of people are still lifted out of poverty by capitalism every year.

As for hundreds of millions of people dying, I find that extremely hard to believe.  Leftist governments have a solid death toll- the State, being the supreme entity in charge of everything, is responsible for all that happens under it.   We know (roughly) how many died under Marxist governments, just as we know how many died under Fascist ones, which had similar Statist overtones.  To count how many died *under* capitalism, one would presumably look at all those who died from because they were unable to afford food or shelter in countries with a capitalist economic system, or the small number of people directly killed by capitalists (ie in work accidents or whatever), or those who commit suicide because of something a capitalist did to them.  I would strongly posit, however, that that figure, even across the past three centuries of capitalism, is *significantly* lower than the more than a hundred million who died under the red flag, often deliberately, or at the very least with the full approval, of governments who believed themselves to be following Marxist ideals.

In principle I like the idea of an educated citizenry - I'd like to live in a country in which any street-sweeper could hold a PhD, and was able to study for the satisfaction of it and for the joy of learning.

In principle, I'd like that to be funded by all of us, collectively, because I think that society reaps huge benefits from education, well beyond those which are tangible and easily measured.

In practice, that's not happening, and it's not going to happen, and I think the current generation is being conned by the promise of university.

What the fuck is the point of getting £30,000 in debt to ""advance yourself"" if you're going to end up working as a barman? 

Realistically, now, the only people who can actually *afford* to go to university are those who were born well-off - the fast-track to a graduate career is reserved for those who've graduated from the best universities and those who can afford to undertake at least several months of unpaid internships first.

If you can afford public school or tutors to help you get the best A-level results then you have significant advantage getting into the best uni's; I can't imagine being able to do unpaid internships without parental support. 

If you can't afford those things then you're going to be at the back of the queue (relative to your natural capabilities) when the jobs are handed out.

It's not your fault if your best career path is via a 3rd-division university and years of minimum wage work before finally managing to enter your field, but you're not going to end up earning the same wage as an overachiever who has breezed through uni, and your student loans will be a burden on you.

Obviously there will be exceptions who succeed despite the odds - who become kernel developers and queen's councils without any family advantages - but they will be the exception, far more than the rule. Besides, university has long been open to all - if your parents were supportive and you studied hard, university was open to you even in the 70s, even if you grew up on a council estate. In those days you'd've got a full grant! Just like Tony Blair and Dave Cameron got.

Back in the day, you could leave school at 18 (or even at 16!) and work your way up, gaining mentoring and promotions based on recognition of your abilities. I have no idea whether that's practicable right now, but it seems to me that many of today's graduates must be starting out no higher on the ladder, for their 3 years of educations and crippling debts.

The fact that you *think you know* the answer makes your opinion totally and utterly worthless. You have literally no idea how many of those people are lying. I don't claim to know who's right and who's wrong; anyone who does is an idiot.

On a side note, there is a misconception that false rape claims are common. They are few and far between and *usually, extremely* easy to identify by police (and no I'm not a feminist).

&gt;For me, it has to be the other way round, they're considered innocent unless proven guilty, and thank fuck the justice system agrees with me.

You've completely ignored my point, just to blurt out some cliche line. I'll repeat myself. 

10% of rapes are reported to police.

37% of rapes *reported* to the police end up in a court case. 

18% of *prosecuted* rape cases end in a conviction. 

An estimated 1% of all rapes (based on *victim surveys*) end with the rapist going to jail. Ill respect the decision of the court to be the the fairest they can give in the circumstances but it's so incredibly easy to get away with rape that a 'innocent' verdict doesn't carry much weight. 

AGAIN, I'll *live by and respect* the courts decision as it's the best we have, but frankly, in most rape cases it doesn't mean jack shit. It's A's word against B's word and the burden of proof is obviously on the victim. It's much, much, much more likely a rapist will get away with their crime than be convicted. Therefore I see court rulings on sexual assault as an extremely shitty guideline and don't put any trust in the decision, but as I said there's no better alternative so I live with it. Forgive me for not trusting them alone with my sister after they are not prosecuted for *lack of evidence* or have their charges dropped for *lack of evidence*.

People are giving pretty bad advice here, I'm gonna go against them.

Don't be a cheap ass and just do things properly. I only made 50 pound turn over in my first month. Hence make sure you have enough money to start the business.

Open a business bank account first. Don't mess around with a personal account. Firstly you need to keep these separate so it's easier to manage your accounts. Secondly you want a business bank manager if you ever need loans etc.

Your not spending money on accountants, they are an investment. Get an accountant from the start, don't piss about. It's bad advice to get one at the end of the year. I'm only 26 so I chose a recommended accountant that was fairly young so he won't retire anytime soon and I can grow a relationship with him(non sexual of course)

Given that this last season was my first, I've had almost no qualms in falling in love with Suárez, and have really enjoyed seeing the team (especially Sturridge Sterling Suárez and Coutinho while Gerrard is still playing) come together, so naturally I wanted England and Uruguay to force me to choose by both getting to the final game somehow, naturally thinking Italy would be the main hurdle, assuming they were in better form than the one that saw them finish below *New Zealand* in our second ever world cup. Wouldn't have thought the only possible outcomes for Luis to get more world cup games have Costa Rica as the other team going through.

If Uruguay don't beat Italy, I hope I at least hope Pirlo gets tired and Marco Verratti gets a chance and makes the most of it.",1,1403320689,null,0,false,0,cid1xrq,t3_28op16,t1_cid1xrq,t1_cicyz73,null,1434333913,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0
