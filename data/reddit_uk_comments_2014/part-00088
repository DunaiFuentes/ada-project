true,tfb,null,null,"You're not missing something: it was better.  My memory may not be very reliable, but I think the course of events was something like:

* there was conventional rubbish collection from bins / bags (I don't remember which but I think bags) which happened at least once a week;
* wheelie bins were imposed sometime in the late 90s;
* it turns out that wheelie bins don't work very well in a city where many people live in tenements since there is nowhere to keep the bins short of lugging them up and down stairs (who could have predicted that?);
* so the solution to this problem was to mostly-abandon wheelie bins and move back to bags which now were dumped into these huge street-side communal bins which get emptied occasionally, usually just after someone has set them on fire (or perhaps after the accumulated rubbish has reached some kind of critical mass and spontaneously caught on fire);
* in some posh bits of Edinburgh these were rejected because they're an eyesore (obviously no-one cares about the poorer bits, because councillors and those whose bribes they take do not live there) and there is still bag collection, but as the collection system has collapsed (everyone sacked, money redirected to school fees and gold-plated taps for the usual suspects) the bags are now not collected promptly enough so get opened by foxes and gulls, leaving a really fantastic mess which, since these are posh areas, gets picked up at taxpayer expense.

This is more-or-less exactly what you would expect from Edinburgh council.

The only thing I would mildly disagree on is the fact that noone cares about the poorer bits. I'd consider Dalry Road a poorer bit compared to somewhere like, say, Stockbridge, which I aspire to one day own a townhouse in! This probably isn't a very PC thing to say but you're less likely to have the same amount of active litterers living in the posher bits. Also those in the posher bits tend to be more protective (IMO) of their environments and more engaged in the process of ensuring they stay clean/safe etc. 

The poorer bits probably have a higher percentage of litterers on top of rubbish created by torn bin bags thanks to seagulls, as well as people who may feel generally less empowered than those in more affluent areas. I've been protesting the litter issues in our complex but I totally feel like I'm on my own.

And should it actually happen, we'd have all the businesses from ALL of Europe moving to Britain because there's nobody elsewhere to do the work.

He cannot admit a single good thing about EU membership, not because there isn't any benefits to us being part of the union, but because if he does his entire campaign would fall apart. It's pretty pathetic really. Honestly, if you ever get the opportunity to ask him a question, ask him for a reason that being part of Europe is a good thing. Just one example. He's been an MEP for long enough that he should be able to name at least one.

There's two things that affect how big your pension's going to be in the future - performance and charges. You either improve the potential for greater returns or you lower the charges (or ideally, a combination of both).

The stakeholder is lower cost, but not necessarily the lowest. There are other ""standard"" personal pensions with lower than stakeholder charges. Generally the investment choices within a stakeholder are more restrictive than a personal pension or SIPP.

What you have to come to terms with is are you willing to pay higher charges for the potential for greater returns? If the adviser has made a recommendation for the SIPP they should've done a comparison of charges and also performance that would justify their recommendation.

Sherwood hasn't had a chance to sign his own defenders as he's probably only here until summer. We've also had many injuries and unlucky suspensions with our centre backs and we've not had a consisten back four all season. Maybe Sherwood could do something about the high line, particularly with the fullbacks playing so high up the pitch when they are both error prone when under pressure.

I think we look really good in attack sometimes with Eriksen, Ade, Chadli and Soldado playing well lately. We just need to play more cautiously at the back until our 1st choice back four is fit and that will make us much harder to beat because leaking goals is our biggest weakness lately.

Children have smart phones and share content. Children visit friends houses where internet use isn't monitored.

So to be massively controversial, parents aren't physically capable of monitoring every part of their children's internet access. It simply isn't possible.

Before everyone freaks out - I'm not 'pro censorship', and with that said and absolutely clear, I do *understand* that many responsible parents have a genuine concern. Calling them irresponsible if they can't simply block out the internet at will and impose their own rules all the time - even when their children aren't in front of them - simply isn't understanding the reality of how utterly pervasive the internet is.

true,Darneil,,Protein shake to go.,"If you like tales of colonial war and Britain being badasses, look at the Battle of Assaye, 1803. British infantry backed up by Indian regiments had to march up a hill into the face of the Indian Maratha Confederacy's line of cannons, 80+ of them in fact. Most of the regiments got stalled on their approach by the sheer weight of fire, except for the Highlander Regiments. (72nd and 78th, I think?)

The Highlanders on the right flank kept going and eventually they figured out that they were alone, half way up the kill, being obliterated by fire and being harassed by enemy infantry/cavalry. They went to severe casualty rates and realized that, instead of running, their only option was to keep going, and they charged up the kill, with few men left, into the face of cannons. 

They hit the gun line, and the Indian tactics were the opposite of the European. They had their guns up front, and when they were threatened, infantry moved infront of them. But when they faced the Scottish, they were met with blood curdling demons of the abyss who were screaming with fury and were killing everything in sight. The Scottish regiments almost broke the enemy army single handedly. 

From then on, Scottish Regiments were absolutely feared by the Indian nations. They considered them demons from hell who had no fear and never ran away, and it was partly true. Most of the major battles of India were won by the Scottish regiments, who cemented themselves as badasses. But because few people care about the Indian campaigns of the Age of Cannon and Sail, no one really knows about their actions.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Assaye

Little tidbit too. The enemy commander was Anthony Pohlman, a European bought by the Maratha Confederacy to train the Indian soldiers in the lethal efficiency of European combat tactics. Also, this was one of the first major combat actions by Sir Arthur Wellesley, who later led the campaign in India, then became supreme Allied Commander of the Penninsula Campaign against Napoleon from Portugal, through Spain and into France, earning the title the Duke of Wellington.

First of all, this doesn't really represent a change.  They opposed same-sex marriage when they felt there was a reasonable chance of stopping it.

It was just the obvious thing to do from a PR point of view, regardless of whether you agree with same-sex marriage or not - if things change and repealing the law becomes a realistic possibility, I wouldn't be surprised if they become a lot less conciliatory.

Secondly, we have forced numerous organisations to stop discriminating against people and this is generally regarded as a good thing, and generally seems to accelerate the decline of bigoted views and behaviour.

If what you say were true, it's a good thing we're building the carriers today so they'll be ready by the next decade.

They have and they could. The war may not be finished overnight, but they *could* achieve their objectives overnight (i.e taking mt. Pleasant airbase).

&gt; *we have a contingency plan to fly up to ~20 odd additional Eurofighters to mount pleasant within 48 hours.*

We do? Do you have a source on that? I know during the Falklands war, we could barely fly one Vulcan bomber from the Ascension islands to the Falklands, with the help of 11 tanker aircraft.

I agree. It would make it possible, if not much easier to take back the Falklands.

true,tigernmas,,Monaghan,"The last paragraph makes an excellent point. No wonder there has been a rise in both dissident republican and loyalists activity. These things do not happen when people are content with their situation and have a job to keep themselves occupied. Societies with more wealth equality are also shown to have much less violent crime. If you look back to the second world war where there was full employment in NI it was also one of the most peaceful times I can think of in NI history.

Unfortunately the rise in these activities lead to rising policing bills when the money could be better spent trying to alleviate the issues causing these problems in the first place. Thus you get a downward spiral that's bad for everyone.

Whatever path is taken to try and solve this it will have to be one that benefits these people the most. You're not going to have the middle class go off and join some paramilitaries when things aren't great. I don't think we should be focusing on trying to pull in tech companies and other specialised industries that won't create mass employment. Down south we have lots of them and they employ people from other countries because we don't have enough people with the skills.

Foreign investment is also vulnerable to being scared off by turmoil. NI needs to be more self sufficient. Perhaps a new deal style job creation effort to build up more infrastructure or something along those lines as a temporary solution while building up co-operatives as a sizeable chunk of the economy that will not run away but will stay rooted in the local community.

Otherwise they would be deciding who is worthy of coverage and who is not, instead of it being directed in a more democratic way by the public. 

&gt;even if he was favoured by certain fringe factions of the Labour Party

For a long time he was considered a shoe in to become its leader. He was half a percentage away from being elected deputy leader and if he had not lost his seat in 83 due to boundary changes he would have replaced Foot as leader. He was cabinet minister is more than two governments. At one point he had the majority of the party behind him. He was not a fringe member, he was at the centre of the party for most of the late 60's, the 70s and then until the mid 80's when the Party began to move to the right. He may have lost out to the right but that doesn't mean that he wasn't at the centre (not the fringe) of the party for a good deal of its history.

The Labour Party is an important part of who Tony Benn was and what he achieved, but make no mistake, it was the Labour movement (No PLP) that was behind him and it was the Labour movement for whom he fought. That is why perhaps his biggest contribution towards the Labour party was to make it far more democratic and accountable towards its members. His writings on the idea of a 'presidential prime minister' and democracy in general are still used and referenced in Universities today.

This entire narrative is so fucking BS. Chelsea fans were unanimously behind Ranieri. No one wanted him gone. Then we were devastated when Jose left. We wanted Carlo to stay for a third year. We wanted Guus. We still sing DiMatteos name. Even utter mediocrities like AVB, Grant and Scolari were supported until the very end. 

Chelsea supporters love our managers.  LOVE them. The one exception was Rafa whom we hated from the day he was hired, actually from the moment his hiring became a conceivable possibility, and we stuck to our guns no matter what. 

And you're one to talk. I realize you've been a Liverpool supporter for all of five minutes and may not realize this, but your gobshite fans was ready to ship Rafa out as soon as possible towards the end, you pretty much turned on Hodgson from day one and even King Kenny was booed.

* In the Falklands war our tanker aircraft was the Handley Page Victor, 5,217 nmi range, 91,000 lb fuel. Today we have Airbus Voyagers, 8,000 nmi range, 245,000 lb fuel. Makes it a little bit easier.

true,undefeatedantitheist,english,Cheshire,"On certain things, at certain points, the bible is very clear. A cursory google will produce lists of its unambiguous content a hundred long - why do you conflate me not typing this out with some sort of flaw in what I have said?

I'm not sure what kind of person you think you're talking with. If I was not extremely literate in a subject, I would not comment with the degree of conviction I've demonstrated. You seem eager for me to give you an argument from authority (a strong indication of the theist mentality). Are you aware that the argument from authority is a fallacy?

Perhaps I should just point you to others with fame to match their literacy, Dawkins, Hitchens, Russel, Dennett, Harris etc, to name the modern exemplars.

I've been studying religion and its poison since I was a teenager, learning and debating the issues as part of Mensa SIGs, univertisty groups and secular societies. I still have my original junior school King James  with my questions, notes and repudiations written throughout. I have written a scholarly work (of theism and computer science) on why the next revelation to be claimed by the clergy will likely involve simulation theory, which is a prime candidate for the arsenal of the odious. I warn how predatory and deluded clergymen will pervert the science into rhetoric for yet another wave of theist madness. Does one have to state these things in order to prevent an apologist like yourself from asserting I ""haven't read it""? That kind of irrational fingers-crossed school yard horse shit should disgust you as much as the Bible should, as much as theism should.

Regarding some of your commentary, usage of the left-right paradigm is worthless. It is an anachronism that doesn't survive *any* kind of wisdom, and certainly doesn't apply to conversations wherein the apologist of bronze-age scripture is being told its contents are verifiably fucking appalling. What one-dimensional continuum do you perceive represents this? Which way is left? ...Primitive rubbish.

Avoidance you say? I've avoided nothing that I can see. Write me a question if you feel something hasn't been addressed.

Too hard to think about? IQ 152, Cattell scale, aged 8. (More argument from authority - the fallacy you seem to enjoy).

Stop defending the Bible. It is a work of hatred and control, tyranny and ignorance. Even the few laudable things it states (which are utterly contradicted elsewhere, without exception) do not redeem it or its subscribers from the most objectionable position imaginable: that of championing a lie; that of failing to see that it *is* a lie; that of preventing people from questioning the lie; that of deriving world views and social policy from lies. There is no Yahweh, there is no unicorn, there is no teapot.

Furthermore there is no democratic scrutiny or direct power over the executive. These are major, major problems for an institution that claims to be democratic. 

Furthermore it is germane that many people in the EU don't feel like their vote counts for much in the scheme of things, as consent and engagement are key in any democracy. If people feel disconnected, you can't dismiss it- the fault lies with the institution and how it engages with the voters. This disconnect was exacerbated by the French and Irish 'no' votes to the constitution being absolutely ignored, and votes in places like the UK cancelled.

true,Messisfoot,null,null,"Well for starters, tackling is one the key things you want from a holding midfielder as their job is to screen attacks in-coming to your back 4. You wouldn't put Eriksen or Gylfi in this role.

Next, just because Sandro, Bentaleb, Paulinho, Holtby, Carroll, Capoue, Eriksen, and Gylfi have ""midfielder"" in their title, doesn't mean they play the same role. You can't interchange Eriksen with Sandro, and it would be foolish to do so. Of the midfield tools at our disposal, each needs a backup should injury occur.

Eriksen is our creative playmaker, and nobody has been able to play that role. We've tried to force Gylfi into it, but his passes aren't that creative. Holtby is the closest replacement to a playmaker.

Paulinho, Dembele, and Bentaleb are our box-to-box midfielders. They surge forward and work both offensively and defensively. 

Lastly, Sandro and Capoue are our holding/defensive midfielders. Why Capoue is important is because Sandro has a tendency to get injured. Whats more is our play suffers when we don't have a holding midfielders as the other midfielders are forced to track back more and can't offer the creative outlets for the same extended period of time.

Bentaleb has played as a lone holding mid, true. But we have played sooo much better when we have either Capoue or Sandro in that role. I don't see why we would force a square peg into a round hole.

If we really had to offload someone, in my humble opinion, its Gylfi. And its not because of his skill but rather because we can't afford the luxury that is him. His best play at Swansea and under us has been when he played as an auxillary midfield striker. He has a deadly long range shot - as we saw at Southhampton - that he can use to pounce on shots.

I'm not sure about UKPF, but certainly most in PF will try and keep costs as low as possible by investing in low cost index funds, and then minimise platform fees and things like that.

Why low cost index funds? If you get your asset allocation right, they can be very diverse, and they will always perform very similarly to the market average, because it is their job to track their market average. Actively managed funds try to beat the market by picking stocks they think look great, some of them beat the market, lots of them don't, the index tracker will always perform similar to the market average. Actively managed funds cost a lot more in AMCs.

r/PF has a particular hard-on for vanguard because its founder kind of pioneered low cost index funds and the company is set up in a way that it's owned by its funds (I think) and so investing in vanguard funds means you own a small part of the company.

Second, all supporters that only had ""distant hopes"" of 4th were either being far too pessimistic or were concealing their true beliefs for fear of some karmic punishment (like believing the team can finish top 4 has any influence on whether it will happen).  

I fail to see how admitting that Liverpool has a shot at the title is pointless.  It's what every player and supporter is involved for, right? Regardless of whether it's for the title or top four, the team will take it one game at a time and try to win every game.

And in my opinion, based on the skills he has exhibited so far, Bentaleb is very good at everything else, and *usually* a good tackler.  I don't need a lecture about different roles, because they're not relevant to to argument I was making.  It's fine to have player who perform different roles.  But the point of my argument is that we would have a very hard time fitting all of the players into a rotation.  We simply have too many.  

Supposing we play a 4231, that's two CM spots.  The candidates for those spots are Bentaleb/Sandro/Capoue as the holder, and Mousa/Paulinho/Carroll/Holtby as the box to box guy.  We should honestly be looking to offload one of each.  Capoue is the only one I'd not have a problem seeing sold.  Send Carroll on loan again maybe.

Point is, I disagree that Bentaleb is better suited to a box to box role.  His positioning and composure are far more suited to that role than they are a box to box.  He's not a brilliant dribbler, and he's not a terribly creative passer.  He doesn't fit either role.  However, he does have the ability to play as a passing DM.

Stakeholder plans are a structure of personal pension which came out in 2001 - they have capped AMCs, no entry or exit charges, and most providers will have one, because of the legislation on them, stakeholder policies from different companies are very similar, the fund choice is the only major difference.

SIPPs are Self-Invested Personal Pensions - they're more flexible, the range of things you can invest in is greater, not just funds but stocks, shares and all sorts of other things, I think commercial property and I think SIPPs can even take out a mortgage - I'm definitely no expert.

Personal Pensions just tends to be used for anything that's not an Occupational Pension (a pension owned by the employer which is governed by different legislation).

If Liverpool completely tanked in the last 7 matches, we would not make top 4. Your definition of tanking is not tanking.

Let's say we lose to all the top 6 sides we play, and all the relegation battlers. That leaves us with 3 points against Newcastle and a likely 5th or worse finish.

Charges are capped at 1.5% for the first 10 years and then 1% after that.

A personal pension is your ""standard"" contract. Most will offer access to the provider's own insured funds plus also access to external fund managers (for additional cost). Most personal pension providers impose minimum contribution levels of £100 or £200 per month, but because of these higher minimums than stakeholder they can offer lower charges.

A SIPP is a self-invested personal pension. In addition to insured funds and other external funds, there's wider access to investments such as commercial property, unquoted shares and even things like fine wines. SIPPs are really for the serious investor. Because of all the fancy things that they offer, the charges are usually higher than those of a stakeholder or personal pension.

If your ""perspective"" is based on you being black or Asian then I can see why nobody wants to hear it. Nobody likes Dianne Abbott because she tries to validate all of her inane views with her blackness.

&gt;The government has forced course closures, threatened institutional shutdowns, scrapped the Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) for college students, and tripled university tuition fees to £9,000 a year.

&gt;These policies have a detrimental and disproportionate impact on black and Asian students' access to opportunities

""Institutional shutdowns"" doesn't mean anything to me.

EMA didn't do any good. If your parents could afford to send you to school at 15 then they can afford to send you at 16, 17 and 18. EMA was just giving kids money to spend on Xbox games.

University fees are covered by a ridiculously cheap loan that you don't even have to pay back.

1-1 at Stoke was a bit of a letdown after a 3-0 win against Cardiff in Monk's first game. Thought we would continue, but a point at Stoke is nothing to be ashamed about. 

I'm not too worried about the FA Cup loss to Everton. You look at the lineup we trotted out there and it seemed to me that Monk wanted to focus more on the PL. 

The home game against Napoli was awesome. Loved watching it. We were the aggressors and I was sure we would get a goal. The game probably could've ended 3-0 and I wouldn't have been surprised. We played great.

We showed some nice poise at Liverpool, punching back when they punched us. One point would've been excellent there, but no surprise that we missed out.

The game at Napoli was really frustrating. We went up 1-0 and it just seemed like we coasted. Monk had a questionable sub (putting in Taylor for Emnes) and we just couldn't capitalize on our chances like the home side. We had 10 shots on goal, they had four. It wasn't like our chances were weak, either. Reina made some great saves.

After that loss, I was disappointed. We weren't really expecting to make a run in Europe, but it was definitely in our grasp. But we moved on. I was glad now we could focus all attention on the PL, and we had two tasty home games coming up. A chance at six points was there.

But we drew with CP after Chico's 80th minute challenge, which was a bit of bad luck. We dominated the majority of the game... 66% possession and 5 to 2 shots on target. Two points squandered, but I chalked it up to bad luck.

I was again hopeful for three points against West Brom. Michu was back, and I thought he would bring with him that clinical finisher that we needed. Again, we started strong but faded quickly in the second half. That was the first game out of all of these that I was very uncomfortable with how we gave in.

Loss at Everton was similar to the loss at Liverpool. I was proud of the way we played and fought, but I wasn't expecting three points. A draw would've been lovely...

And as it turns out, we drew with Arsenal. Lovely point to receive, but the way we received it wasn't the best. I would've liked to see us hold our 1-0 lead (and not give up back-to-back goals), but one point at Emirates Stadium is decent.

TL;DR: I think we've had some bad luck, particularly against Napoli and CP. But we've left points on the table, and there's no one to blame but us. Our form could've been much better against West Brom and Stoke in the second half.  

I'd love to see us go out and grab six points in the next two games.",0,1396034534,null,0,false,0,cgedekl,t3_21lp11,t1_cgedekl,t3_21lp11,null,1433111057,4,false,swanseacity,t5_2tip4,4

Are you suggesting something is wrong with Socratic style?

Concerning the 'group' you ask me about, the only general description I could make is that of the *more rational* over the *less rational*. No doubt much of the pressure for gay rights (a stupid phrase - 'human rights' should be used) comes from theist homosexuals who don't realise the irony, or who perhaps do, but ignore the problem with a flourish of cognitive dissonance, or from quasi-deist/theist homosexuals (and heterosexuals) who cherry-pick their scripture. In any case, the drive to tackle the homosexual bigotry of the Yahweh cults significantly undermines it. All things other things being equal, the clergyman or theist who lacks a kind of bigotry present in another is *more rational*.

Bit by bit, even if - ironically - some of the motivation comes from religion itself, every little shift away from the so-called words of God dismantles the credibility and power of theist base, such that each new generation encounters a weaker and more obviously ridiculous position and so fewer take on the mantle.

Whether it is a good deal also depends on how you value your own time. The example I gave in my previous post would cost you around 1% less, that's 1% extra growth per year through lower fees, but you'd have to have the time and will to do a bit of research and actually do it yourself. 

Deciding what you want to invest in is the toughest part, opening the SIPP is easy, finding a good provider is fairly easy with some googling and looking at the charges, and once you've set it up, chosen where to invest your money each month, you kind of just forget about it and review your plan every year or 6months. 

If you don't want to do any of that work yourself, the advice might be worth it to you. The adviser might pick better performing investments than you do as well and outperform his fee, in which case it would definitely be worth it, but he can't guarantee that he will, even if he has every year in the past.

Nobody has the right to not be offended, but we're not just talking about offense here; the use of language used to dehumanize and ostracize groups of discriminated against people causes harm, and not just offense. Taking to the street to shout ""Fuck niggers/faggots/gypsies"" etc. goes beyond just being offensive. 

The religious conservatives who cry about offense aren't being subjected to blatant and vitriolic hatred based on their religion, and if they were, then they deserve to be protected from that. Hate speech for example is not just something that is offensive, it's hatred directed at a sexuality/race/gender etc. Someone is allowed to say ""I disagree with homosexuality"" in public, (one guy was arrested for going around saying being gay was a sin, but the charges were dropped.) and so they can still express their disagreeable opinions; what they can't do is scream ""I fucking hate queers"" in public.

Well, yeah, but it has been for a long time.  I still don't quite understand what marriage is for at all these days, but that's another conversation.  Nothing to do with the sex of the participants, though.

Finally, it's truly staggering that you think gay marriage won't change anything for gay people, but it will for straight people.  It's **gay** marriage.  Straight marriage is completely unchanged.  Apart from morons like you, of course.  Gay people have gained something, while straight people have neither gained nor lost anything.  I really can't believe this needs to be explained.

Skrtel optimally needs to be paired with a CB who is better, but at the very with one who is extremely positionally sound. If you re-watch the goals we've given up in the last few games you'll see that Skrtel is out of position when Agger or Flanno, or whoever, makes their big mistake, and thus he cannot recover to help.

Skrtel I feel is good in the air and a tackler, obviously his decision making isn't his strong suit but I also feel he has become a lot more calm under-pressure this season, he can also nick a goal which helps.

So I think I am right in saying Skrtel is our best defender and that's why our sub calls him ""the golden god"" as you put it.

true,chilari,eng-shropshire,Shropshire,"&gt; Historically, marriage is an economic arrangement and nothing else.

Furthermore, historically, marriage had nothing to do with the church before the medieval period, when they decided they wanted the monopoly on it. Also historically, polygamy. And polyandry, in Sparta - if there weren't enough women to go around, brothers would share one wife, or if one man couldn't get his wife pregnant he'd borrow his friend's wife for a while to try and have children, and she would live in his household with the social status of a wife.

Defining marriage by history fails to take into account that marriage has been redefined and redefined and redefined over and over and over again. I wonder what Catholics in the 1540s thought of the Reformation after Henry VIII redefined the meaning of marriage by no longer making it permanent and allowing divorce? I wonder how people reacted when a woman ceased to be her husband's property and became an equal partner in a marriage.

The history of marriage is that we change it constantly to reflect society's needs and beliefs. Changing it now to include two people who love each other and want to make a commitment to one another and happen to have the same type of genitals is hardly a big change, in the grand scheme of things.",0,1396038319,null,0,false,0,cgef7ga,t3_21lke7,t1_cgef7ga,t1_cgeegw4,null,1433111905,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

Ah, my bad, for some reason I was under the impression that although they'd actually gained the percentage of votes that they got, they'd still reduced the number of seats that they won.  
  
It'll be interesting to see how the Tories approach voting reform now that Ukip are gaining in popularity. They were staunchly in favour of keeping first past the post because at the time it benefited them, but now that Ukip are gaining traction it's going to end up costing them in the long run.  
  
&gt; What we have is a situation where any party that UKIP may join in a coalition doesn't share the same view on their most important policy; EU membership  
  
This may be true at the moment, while David Cameron is Tory leader, but who knows what could change? There are plenty of Eurosceptic Tories who could end up as Tory leader at some point in the future. David Cameron only just beat David Davis to the job, I can easily imagine a scenario where a Eurosceptic takes his place some point in the near future.  
  
&gt; and like the electoral reform referendum pushed by the Lib Dems in this coalition government, it is not going to turn out like they or their supporters hoped  
  
I'm not too sure about that, Britain seems to be pretty Eurosceptic at the moment. Just look at the opinion polls after the recent Clegg Vs Farage EU debate. Farage came away the clear winner with most people agreeing with him. Voting reform failed for the Lib Dems because most of the public didn't seem to care about it, whereas a lot of the public seem to have very strong opinions about the EU, especially when it's constantly linked to immigration (and Farage knows how to use people's fear of immigration against the EU).",0,1396040486,null,0,false,0,cgeg3nc,t3_21hygu,t1_cgeg3nc,t1_cge40yh,null,1433112393,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

If you ask some of the jolly station staff when the fuzzy trains are due through, you can get a schedule so you can see them in action.

Surely, that would qualify as tanking, right?  Well, even in such a scenario, Liverpool would still be overwhelmingly likely to finish in the top 4 (statistically speaking).  I know that supporters can be fatalists sometimes, but even if Liverpool finish the season having their worst stretch of the campaign, they'll still make top 4.

Here's the c/p'd text:

This post was inspired by another thread, but I thought it deserved its own discussion.

Many people would laugh at the thought of comparing ""money-grubbing Chelski"" to the establishment that is Manchester United. Personally, I'd say it's a decent enough analogy, with time scales adjusted by spending. Basically the Chelsea team under Mourinho (the first time) can be likened to Man U under SAF, just in a very abbreviated sense with regard to building the team.

SAF and Man U built their team the ""proper"" way in the 80s and 90s, when money didn't dominate the sport like it does now. Chelsea got in the game late, though their cosmopolitan nature (Gullit, Vialli, Zola, Wise, etc.) of the mid/late 90s did help their competitiveness and set the stage for their acquisition, investment, and further development. After Roman Abramovich bought the team, he decided the best way to catch up to Man U and Arsenal (both on the pitch and as a brand) would be to take advantage of the resources he had and spend.
At this time, Man U and Chelsea also had two of the top managers in the world at the helm, both instrumental in creating the two teams that fought each other for the title for the better part of a decade. When managers of this stature leave, it can cause quite a problem.

Now, imagine the pressure (from both the fans and the board) of living up to one of the best managers of the game, who's image and imprint on the team still are very evident in both the public consciousness and day to day operations. Everything you do is compared to someone who was very, very successful. The best way to break from this is with someone with a strong personality, something most of Chelsea's managers post Mourinho's first stint were missing, and something I worry Moyes himself doesn't have. This, in my opinion, helps explain the turnover since Mourinho left, as every manager struggled to escape his shadow in the locker room, and could be a sign of things to come for Man U if Moyes or someone else cannot establish themselves as a successful manager in their own right.

Teams cannot copy what Chelsea did to catch up in the early 2000s, because that is now illegal (FFP). But what they can do is copy how Chelsea has managed to stay at the top despite the core of their team aging and loosing influence. The champion's league victory in 2012 was the swansong of the team Mourinho built in his first stint with the club, winning the title while fulfilling all the stereotypes of ""Mourinho's defensive, anti-football Chelsea."" This wasn't a tactical mastermind by a strong willed manger, this was a, ""What's worked best with the players I have? Let's get them in a good mindset and let's do that."" Finishing 6th in the league that year only served to highlight the need to reinvest in the future.

Chelsea have since reinvented themselves while staying FFP compliant (aka not like the early 2000s), by investing in youth as the backbone of the old team has started to age and leave. There is a reason Chelsea have so many young players on loan. By making a lot of low risk high potential investments in young kids, Chelsea has been able to create a squad that looks set to compete on the top level for years. They also solved the manager issue by bringing in one who has a strong enough personality to put his imprint on the team, with the ability to match (no other Chelsea manager since his first stint has done that, with the exception of AVB and his team was tactically flawed). It just happens to be the same manager Chelsea had before, just more experienced and well rounded from his jobs in between.

Man U on the other hand, have not invested in youth at nearly the same level, and are experiencing many of the problems this season that Chelsea faced in 2012. Don't get me wrong, Chelsea were incredibly lucky to win the champions league in 2012 and that definitely helped accelerate the process of reinventing the team (by all accounts Chelsea are a season ahead of schedule, basically thanks to winning the champion's league and getting Hazard as a result). Unfortunately for Man U, that luck hasn't found them.

As to the line-up, I'd move Hoolahan central behind RvW and bring Redmond in on the wing, dropping Elmander. Swansea seem to lack pace, and Redmond gave his full-back a torrid time in the home fixture, so that could lead to chances. I'd definitely keep Tettey and Howson holding, and whilst it's tempting to push Howson into Hoolahan's role and bring Johnson in to shore things up a bit, I don't think Johnson's pass completion is good enough against a team like Swansea.

true,JC920,null,null,"I worked for OA a while back. It's safe to say that no checks on your background were performed. I never knew of any RCs actively verifying any claims unless specifically requested by the client and that usually comes in the form of you showing them your certificate. 

The thing about high street agencies is that the consultants that they employ tend to be there for a very short period of time and have an extremely short attention span. Meaning, if they don't get an instant win with a newly reg'd candidate, they move on to the next one. No fault of your own, the RC will be under pressure to sell so investing time in a candidate that may or may not pay off is a risk most are not willing to take.

Another problem (and probably the main problem), particularly at the moment is that there is a huge supply of candidates with very few jobs available so this could have very easily happened to your application.

I wouldn't take that as a negative on yourself, you are definitely part of the majority when it comes to the agencies. I think a lot of people don't realise that of the few companies looking for staff, the amount of them willing to pay agency rates is even shorter.

I'm not saying don't try and keep your options open, but registering with a particular agency in the traditional way seems like putting a lot of eggs in that basket. Have you tried putting your CV on online job boards? That way the agencies can come to you (generally when they have a specific role that matches your CV/profile).

I hope this makes sense and gives you a bit more direction (it's late and I'm tired!) but if you need any more advice on this, give me a shout

&gt;What more should they have done? Give it the state funeral treatment?

The majority of the coverage the BBC gave to the funeral occurred after a massive backlash on social media over the lack of coverage. Before the backlash their was only a small article on their website, below such important news stories as the break up of Gwyneth paltrow and Chris Martin. There had been no lead up stories at all, even though Benn was getting the rare honour of lying in Westminster Chapel. There was no TV coverage until later in the day. They should have had at least an article informing people it was going to happen. They should have covered the carrying of the Coffin live on TV, they should have had more than just a 5 min segment on it. 

&gt;Did you have these same protestations over Wilson's funeral, or is this simply because Benn's views match your own?

Digital: Pretty empty until about 12:30, but picks up massively then. Entry is usually pretty cheap at free or around 4 quid. Music is mostly generic club music.
  
Audio: Been there once, but it is a very nice club with a huge seated outside smoking area. Not sure about prices.
  
Shoosh: Avoid, avoid, avoid. Sticky carpets, riddled with dickheads, and the bouncers are the worst you will ever come across. 
  
Oceana: I don't like it personally, but its one of the more popular clubs. There are several rooms playing pretty much every type of music, nothing special but you can garuantee it being packed pretty much every night its on.

Life: Tiny tiny club, not a huge fan of it at all.

As the night moves on you could move to some of the bars in town. The Mash Tum, The Mesmerist and the Font are all more loud and lively. If inviting friends from home then I would recommend the Font because it is in the Laines which is something quite unique to Brighton.

Finally if you wanna go to clubs. You can't really go wrong with any of the sea front clubs (Coaliation,Digital).

They have been paid by Cellino for the club and have signed an agreement with him for him to finance the club for at least 6 months. GFH do not believe they have any financial obligation to Leeds and do not want to invest any money into the club because they know they will see no further return it. GFH is a bank, it does not work by morals or duty to the fans, it works by turning over the maximum amount of turnover and making their shareholders happy. 

Purely speculating, I believe GFH have absolutely zero knowledge of how business in football works. They have spent months and invested lots of money into PR to keep fans happy and increase gate numbers and season ticket holders, purely to raise the financial value of the football club. I honestly do not believe they care even one inch about the fans, for them Leeds United is simply another asset that can be brought or sold just like a house. I also think they seriously miscalculated the day to day running costs of running a football club, and have invested far more in the club than they intended too. Hence, why when Cellino came in offering £25m for the club they jumped on that bandwagon, walking all over their own CEO David Haigh and his consortium, and they are so unwilling to negotiate with any other bidder. 

£25m is a massive over valuation of where the club is right now, no one in their right mind would pay that much for a football club in our state. We are losing £12m a year due to GFH's mismanagement, we do not own a stadium and have to pay £2m a year for the privilege to play in it, we do not own a training ground and have to spend £500k a year to have somewhere to train. The only asset the club has of any value, aside from Ross McCormack (who enterprise insurance paid to keep at the club) and Sam Byram, is the fans. 25,000+ fans a week who will keep turning up, paying £20-£30 at a time, for a team that has been out of the top league for nearly a decade.

""I suppose that fear of failure is what drives me on."" Rodgers' focus on failure reminds me of the profile on Gerrard posted a few weeks ago:

&gt;It's clear that a lot of the darker stuff in his head is related to his fear of letting people down. It seems to be constantly on his mind. Before Barcelona played in the 1992 Champions League final, Johan Cruyff tried to relax his team: ""go out there and enjoy yourselves."" When Manchester United were in the final in 1999, Ferguson appealed to his players' ambition: ""imagine what it would feel like walking past that trophy and not being able to touch it."" When Gerrard rallied his teammates before the 2005 final in Istanbul, his focus was on the need not to disappoint the fans: ""Just look at our fans … look how much this means to them. It means the world. Don't fucking well let them down. You don't realise the reaction you will get from these fans if you win. You will be a hero for the rest of your life.""

One thing that irks me is that you think Messi can only play in Barca system and will fail if he doesn't. I don't think that's true at all. I think Messi can fit in any system. Yea you can say he prefers the quick one twos and needle threading through balls but he is equally as fast as Hazard, can pass just as well if not better, definitely has better balance and body control (at this point, Hazard is so damn good at this too which I LOVE).

Your friend, if you're in Scotland, should have a quick chat with a lawyer and he'll be covered by Legal Aid. If you're in England, you're screwed for Legal Aid because its all been cut on the civil side (don't know who thought that was a good idea.)

What I DO know is that he should have been given a written contract of employment with 13 weeks of stating IIRC. This doesn't put either of them (employer or your friend) in a good position, though. The employer can't enforce the repayment, but if your friend doesn't pay, then the employer doesn't have to give notice if he just decides to get rid of him, as there is no contract of employment.

As to the legality of the wage reductions, i can't imagine they'd be legally accepted under the law. As a parallel, the Scottish sheriff courts can award, in a summary civil case, up to £1500 to the 'winners' of the case. It would not be competent to take on a case worth £3000 and say it was 2 awards of £1500 just to make it legal. It doesn't work because it's **one** case. The same goes for your friend's wage reduction. He'd be getting penalised twice for **one** wrong, so effectively its one wage deduction of £80. Any attempt to split the repayment into 2 would be frowned upon by any court, I imagine.

That's my opinion based on my oversight of the law so far, but I have to stress that I am not yet legally qualified as a provider of legal services. Please don't sue me if I'm wrong!!!",0,1396052591,null,0,false,0,cgekv11,t3_21mvki,t1_cgekv11,t3_21mvki,null,1433114636,-3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,-3

Most important is the question of whether anyone was *confusing* this woman's ""Arsenale"" shop with Arsenal F.C., and whether she was profiting off the association with the football club conjured up in people's heads when they hear the word ""arsenal"".

Considering that her store is in Seville, not London, and that the neighborhood her store is located in is the historic Arenal de Sevilla district, it's hard to argue that she's materially benefiting from the association with the football club.  It isn't as if Arsenal are the only Arsenal in the world - there are other clubs with similar names - nor is their club the only meaning of the word.

Compare, for example, the copyright snafu over Candy Crush Saga, which is trying to enforce a claim against another video game called The Banner Saga.  They both have the word ""saga"" in their names, they are both video games, but that's mostly where the similarities end.  That said, I'd *still* say that King (CCS' developer) have a better claim in defending their IP in CCS than Arsenal do in enforcing a claim in that word.

If someone is following you home shouting slurs (or any rude words really) in your ear, then that is *harassment*.

I think you're only seeing this debate from one end.  You're worried about the persecution of minorities, but free-speech is one of the best tools we have to *empower* the disadvantaged.  Free speech means that even the poorest most put upon member of a minority in the country can say what he/she likes.  It allows people to fight back against the powerful even if they themselves have no power.

Another problem I have with your argument is that you're failing to acknowledge likely potential abuses of free-speech laws.  If you start criminalizing speech against religious groups, then every group will claim that speech they don't like is offensive and will demand protection.  Catholics will use speech laws to try to evade people criticizing their record on child sexual abuse and Muslims will use the laws to shield them whilst they continue abusing women or promoting antisemitic views etc.  And if those examples offend you: i) too bad and ii) choose your own religious delusion and fill in the blanks of what can and will go wrong.

Lastly, free-speech restrictions inevitably end up discriminating against *unpopular* speech.  If you want proof of that tendency then look no further than reddit voting patterns.  The downvote button is meant to be used for comments which don't add to the discussion.  We all know this and yet, what happens?  People gleefully use it to punish ideas and comments they don't like.  I like reddit, but the comments section quite often turns into a popularity contest as opposed to a genuine debate.

Why on earth do you think he is one of the strikers we need? Do you really think he is a world class striker that can lead Chelsea to glory? We might as well let Lukaku lead the line and keep Torres. This is what is wrong with most fans these days, they under value their own players and think any new upcoming player is better than what they already have. There are very few strikers out there that can be categorized as world class. If we are in the market for a striker, we should be after the likes of Costa, Cavani etc not Immobiles of this world. Give him at least two more seasons before he falls under that category. I hope we also don't go after Falcao. He is 28 years old and just had serious career ending knee injury.

As far Chelsea reinventing themselves, I'll wait and see until the youth and loans have comeback and make an impact. So far, that hasn't happened. KDB was sold, Kalas is somewhere, and Lukaku got loaned again.

The fact is, Moyes is just the wrong manager for Man U. He is the type of manager that can get you a 4th place finish once in a while with a tight budget.

Here's what we do with such people.  We ignore them.  We avoid them.  We don't throw them in jail.  (Edit: OK, I changed my mind on this.  The extreme cases are essentially 'breaches of the peace' which should be punishable by law.)

I know you and others can have fun fantasizing about the worst possible abuses of free-speech, but at some point you need to recognize that most of us don't live in such a nightmarish world.  Free-speech nations tend to be among the most civil and tolerant of all societies.  Far from seeing people shouting racist epithets, what I see when I go into work is people showing respect and tolerance for those from other cultures.  And that tolerance wasn't forced upon us by a government appointed language police.  It was of our own choosing.

Yes there's still racism, but we've made progress.  A few centuries ago you could have been tortured and killed for not having the right beliefs and if you were non-white you weren't even considered to be part of the human race.  Even Irish people were considered savages, of inferior genetic stock.

So what happened?  Essentially, we've been able to use *reason* to think our way into a better society.  And this is partly because we had the freedom to challenge even the most deeply ingrained views.  Free-speech is in good part responsible for the progress we've made and it's essential that we remain a free-speech society if we want to see further improvements.

I think that oft-times people (like you!) seem to think that free-speech advocates secretly just want the freedom to use the N-word or to abuse minorities.  But I really don't think that's true.  I think that people who are serious about free-speech issues believe that the freedom for *anyone* to express ideas is a tool for helping the oppressed rather than setting them back.",0,1396057752,null,0,1396062288,0,cgemtr7,t3_21hydj,t1_cgemtr7,t1_cgem59l,null,1433115563,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

There are still people who say this shit in public; the standing around shouting slurs isn't exactly a common thing, but there was the case last year of fans who were just spouting blatantly racist shit on the train and throwing slurs left, right and centre, and there are still people who spout this kind of shit in public. Just because you don't see it doesn't mean it doesn't happen, and I'm also not suggesting that this is something that most people do. The train incident wasn't an example of people who are mentally ill. I'm not talking about locking any of these people up though, a fine or some kind of community service as opposed to jail time. 

Reason doesn't work on those who just spout hate. In public, if someone just starts going on a racist/homophobic/anti-semitic tirade (and by no means is it just the mentally ill who do this), there are plenty of people who won't speak up or say anything. We don't need to allow people to spout that shit, especially when it's against groups who don't receive lots of public support, such as trans people or travellers. 

I don't think people just want to abuse minorities, I just don't think we need to protect people spouting blatantly hateful shit in public. Again, they can express their ideas, just not by being so incredibly hateful.

The only other option is continuing to fund the club in the hope they will get a better deal further down the road, but I don't think they will see that as an option.

The real problem they have is anyone else thinking of buying the club now has the upper hand as they can just wait until we go into administration and then snap us up for a pound.  If it was me, I wouldn't pay £25m for goodwill.  I'd wait, spend my pound and then invest the £25m in players.

true,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"They've already had the VAT back.  They've also already had statutory interest back.

Their further claim was that they wanted compounded interest.  Because the errors go back to 1973 the compounded interest is worth rather a lot of money.

Part of the problem is that interest isn't compounded for tax either when you owe the government or when the government owes you.

The issue comes about in that paying this out sort of exploits that.  If the VAT had been correctly calculated they wouldn't have paid the VAT at 15%, 17.5%, 20%, but that reduced cost would have been reflected in their profits for corporation tax.  It is almost certain that what they lost through not getting interest is less than what they owe on CT and would owe on interest on it.

*(This assumes of course that they wouldn't have acted like tax dodgers and found some way to avoid paying tax on it.)*

**However** there are two arguments for not trying to apply the charge to corporation tax year on year.  For one thing the assessing time limits are way past, so it couldn't be taxed at all now.  For another, where you have contingent income like this the charge to tax doesn't arise until your right to it crystallises.  *(Meaning when the judge says you're entitled to the money.)*

So what they want is to have the benefit of compounding the interest **without** the appropriate offsetting of liability that would have arisen if corporation tax had been paid..  They'll then pay CT on it in the period they get the money.

true,CaptainPedge,null,null,"Ok. ""Chip and pin"" is the normal term used for the way our credit/debit card machines work over here. (There is also a system of contact-less payments which uses NFC, but this is pretty rare because chip and pin works so well).

Virtually every chip and pin machine has a magnetic stripe reader which should work with your cards, and virtually every merchant will accept Visa or MasterCard branded cards, and most places will accept American Express, but that's more or less it, I've never come across any other cards in use in the UK.

As far as opening a bank account over here, I'd have a look at the websites of a few of the UK high street banks to check what the requirements are to open an account. You might be able to set things up before you even arrive in the UK.

Our system of banks is a little different to the US one, Ours seems to be (to my point of view) much easier for the customer, compared to yours. If you have an account at one branch of, say, NatWest, you can access just about all of its' features from any branch in the country. Most bank-run ATMs don't charge you for access to your money and in general the whole thing moves more smoothly, though we do get screwed over by fees and corrupt bank bosses just the same as you guys do.",0,1396064039,null,0,1396064280,0,cgep1ay,t3_21n8ff,t1_cgep1ay,t3_21n8ff,null,1433116670,5,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,5

Ignore the Barclay brothers.  They own the company, but that doesn't matter.  The issue is between the state and the company.

1.  Customs &amp; Excise charged too much VAT from 1973 to 2004.

2.  Around 2010 the company put in a VAT reclaim for around £400 million.  They got this back.  This was the overpaid VAT.

3.  The relevant legislation states that where you're owed money you get interest charged at a statutory rate.  They also received this.

4.  The company did not accept this and made a claim for compound interest going back to 1973.

5.  It appears that in 2012 the High Court referred the matter to the European Court.  *(I'm a bit vaguer on this bit.  I haven't read the old decisions.  Just the highlights.  The new one hasn't been published yet.)*

6.  The High Court has now announced that the company's claim is successful.

The thing is they're not fighting to not pay tax.  They're demanding additional interest is paid to them.  The issue of fixing the legislation is unusual in that we already have legislation and it says you do not get compound interest.

Nevertheless **if** between now and the matter finally settling the legislation is tinkered with it will not be to retrospectively impose tax, it will be to prevent a retrospective change in the interest treatment handed down by way a an opinion of the European courts.

The transfer market makes muppets of a lot of fans and I'd really love if this season and our success via the growth of young talent here will teach those types of fans on this sub a thing or too. 

The only signing issue we had was Brendan's first summer and that turned out to be a blessing in disguise because we went out and got Sturridge and Coutinho, while Dempsey continues to look average in the US (not that I don't rate Dempsey but he was obviously never more than a stop gap).

This is what bothers me most about fans. They confuse these stopgap type signings with actual stars and the only reason is because we'll have cunts like Tottenham come into it and make us feel like the guy must be worth something. 

Some examples of guys who are stopgap signings and won't elevate us that we've been linked with only for the coming windows:

Those two Ukranian winger lads who I'm not even going bother spelling their names. They are no more proven than Aspas. Do we need to sign another Aspas? Which isn't a slight on Aspas, it's a statement that he's unproven and won't be able to assert himself without proper time. 

I'm not even going to go on but there are plenty of people just like that who don't represent value for money.


We are at the point where we need to be signing players who are as close to guarantees as we can find. There's risk to every signing, but you balance that risk with the money you spend. 

If you look at our weaknesses, I think we're at a point where we the position we need the biggest improvement in quality is our 3rd striker. Perhaps a CM to replace Allen and a LB to replace Enrique or RB to replace Johnson, with Flanno slotting in wherever there is a departure.

Quite the difference between those two. If you are British born of Iranian heritage then clearly you should have the same rights as any other Brit. But if you are Iranian and only living here, then I don't see why they can't close your account. 

I mean, isn't the whole idea behind sanctions to make it costly, annoying and punishing for people from a certain country? It's not racial profiling to close Iranian bank accounts in the UK. The idea is to cause a problem for Iran, and part of that is to piss off their citizens who then become frustrated at their government.

I wish people would stop throwing Lukaku and Drogba together like father and son. They aren't, move off of that shit already. They play differently.

I don't think Lukaku's workrate is low, it's simply he's inconsistent. You wanna know what helps consistency? You want to know what helps that? Game time. Not on loan, with the team he will be playing with for a long while. If we loan him out again, I would be absolutely SHOCKED if we see him in a blue's shirt again. That would be a huge fucking mistake.

Do you see any sort of hype around a player that we could realistically get our hands on that is anywhere near as proven as Lukaku? Hell no. Why are so many of you fans jumping on the thought of selling him? I honestly don't get it. Just like the other thread that came up early today. You guys make up bullshit excuses for a reason to sell him, and I don't understand it for a second. I don't understand why we'd sell Lukaku to keep Eto'o (who, don't get me wrong has been doing very well, but not a top class goal scorer anymore, let's not stretch the truth), and a very scary player to bring in that is Costa. And for what? To sell off a future star just because of his 'emotion', or his 'workrate'? Even though both complaints are just made up excuses?

Because the specific type of fiscal union required is in place. The automatic fiscal stabilisers are in place to act counter cyclically against asymmetric shocks. These ties will be cut if independence goes through, because we wouldn't share the same budget.

The benefits of joining a currency union are dependent on the total value of transaction with the rest of the currency union **as a whole**. These are far higher with the euro area. So the gains to a currency union with Europe (ignoring the costs) are greater than Scotland. Therefore any benefit to joining the currency union with the euro area is larger than Scotland. 

Note Canada trades a lot with US, yet no currency area. Quantity of trade alone does not make a region suitable for a currency union, or an optimal currency area. They are the same thing.

You wouldn't have even mentioned the point of singular country basis if you understand what you were talking about. You have a very strong opinion, without understand the the pros and cons or a willingness to even try to understand it (and by understand it I mean read a couple of papers, Krugman, or even just go to wikipedia).

If you care about what's best for Scotland, it is in your best interest to understand this issue. I can highly recommend De Grauwe's book on the economics of monetary unions.

It's also the question of who cares if the role of till monkey vanishes?  I mean no one uses it as a long term career, more and more supermarkets are doing away with the role, replacing with self service tills / portable self scan devices.

&gt;ive looked at your account, youre a pilot. A useless flying idiot.

Erm, you might want to look closer, or understand a bit what you are looking at.

&gt;you really think you're so special and your skills are so valuable. fighter pilots are trained up in a month on simulators in the us army. that technology WILL come here to england.

Well that's just not true, they might get a type conversion, but it still takes over 9 months just to get to fast jets.  The question is how will drones change things.  Before pilots have to learn everything about all the automated systems, so they can understand what to do if they fail.  If you've got a drone, remote operated, then they don't need to, they've got engineers on hand for that.  So in a way it's simplifying the skills and barriers to entry.

However, if you put as much time into being outraged as learning what /r/flying flairs mean, you'd see that I don't fly planes for a living.  If you'd done a better job stalking me, you'd probably have a very good guess what I do for a living.

Now I don't know why you've got the butthurt about this, but frankly I think posting on a topic about loosing a control wire, about flying and landing a plane using the doors is actually a fascinating exercise in understanding aerodynamics, plus it's kinda funny, and is a skill that has helped me before in an emergency situation.

&gt;We need the fans to stay calm. I know when you want something so much that's easier said than done.

&gt;They haven't been in this position for a while. I can understand that sometimes there is that wee bit of trepidation and fear.

&gt;But what we're looking to put in place here isn't just for one season. We're looking to put something in place for the longer term in order to have sustainable success.

To me this is the perfect example of the brilliance of Brendan Rodgers. He carries himself with a wonderful combination of cool confidence and keen self-awareness. He somehow takes the corporate-speak and sport-cliches and delivers them in such a genuine way. It's a cliche, but it's a breath of fresh air to me.

I can't find the quote at the moment but Rodgers said something a while ago that really stuck with me. To paraphrase, he said that even if he was sacked he'd be happy knowing that he had laid down a new, modern foundation for Liverpool Football Club. And, to me, it's true. He really brought about a new way of thinking to the club (academy, training staff, tactics, etc) all while understanding and embracing the rich history of the club.

And now Rodgers is backing up his philosophy with results.

He brings out every drop of potential from his players in any team he manages.

Grey squirrels are an invasive species which have become ubiquitous throughout most of the UK, rather like rabbits have in Australia. They're similarly officially classed as a pest (for example if you capture a grey squirrel it's illegal to release it back into the wild) but they're pretty much everywhere in England, having driven our native reds out to the more remote wooded parts of Scotland and Wales. You can find greys in almost every park in England.

Another native animal you might well see is a fox, in the last 20-30 years they've colonised pretty much the entirety of British cities from the suburbs to the centres (I've seen them right in the heart of central London).

Beyond that, we've got badgers (elusive because they're nocturnal and rural), otters (elusive because they're nocturnal and like river banks away from humans), a large variety of shrews and voles (which you'll probably never see unless it's a dead one that a cat's brought in), two snakes (you'll like this bit: only one of which is venemous and even then it's reportedly no worse than a bee sting) which again you'll probably never see. Rabbits and hares are quite common in country areas, your best bet for spotting them is at dawn or dusk.

The other large mammal we have is several species of deer. Around London you can see these in Richmond Park, alternatively there are large herds in Epping Forest but they're harder to spot there and outside of London there are deer in many of the larger woodland areas.",0,1396083228,null,0,false,0,cgetkbp,t3_21n8kq,t1_cgetkbp,t3_21n8kq,null,1433118804,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3

Yep, I'd say that's feasible. The roads are pretty hilly, and the locals drive like maniacs (sorry), but it would be enjoyable and definitely doable. Here's a suggested itinerary: 

Night in Portree, followed by day round the North End. Take in the Storr and Quiraing, with Kilt Rock, Lealt Falls and the crofting and dinosaur museum (this is a real thing) - about a 30 mile round trip, I think, with places that sell cake scattered throughout. 

Next day, pack up and head for Dunvegan, which is 22 miles from Portree - there's a castle, coral beach, cafes. Next day, out to Neist Point, through Glendale - again, lots of cake places (this is how I decide where to cycle), then head for Carbost. 

Spend the next day around carbost - Talisker distillery, Talisker bay, Fairy Pools, get some oysters from the oyster shed, maybe a walk up into the mountains from Glen Brittle beach. Stay in Carbost again, because the pub is brilliant. 

From there, head south. I don't know the south of the island so well, so can't be very specific, but the Elgol and Sleat peninsula are both very lovely and worth a day. You could end the trip in Sleat, and get the ferry to Mallaig, or else you could explore the mainland a bit. I've always wanted to cycle the road from Kyle to Lochcarron - it's hilly and ridiculously beautiful. You could take a trip to Plockton as well which is also sickeningly picturesque.

true,buried_treasure,null,null,"&gt; video gaming is very popular here and an area that the UK does well in

That's very true. What an employer actually has to do, to be able to sponsor a non-EU applicant, is demonstrate to the Home Office that they've been unable to find a suitable applicant who already has permission to work.

In practice that means that the employer MUST advertise the job in all the usual places. Depending on the sort of job, ""all the usual places"" could vary from simply the local job centre, through to the major UK and trade publications, and even the whole of the EU if the position is one that merits that. Once advertised, if they reject any applications, they MUST be able to demonstrate to the Home Office why they rejected them.

Assuming the employer can demonstrate to the Home Office's satisfaction that they genuinely haven't been able to find anyone in the EU who's able to do the job, the government will then *consider* granting a visa. There's still lots of money to be paid and forms to be filled at this point, and it's by no means a done deal.

That's why it typically takes at least a few months to successfully sponsor an overseas applicant. Given the current state of the employment market in the EU (tens of millions of highly-skilled but unemployed young graduates (especially in southern and eastern Europe), most of whom have very good English language skills), it's generally pretty hard for companies in the IT or gaming sector to genuinely be able to say they couldn't find someone to fill a vacancy.",0,1396089641,null,0,false,0,cgeudhf,t3_21n09j,t1_cgeudhf,t1_cgetj3e,null,1433119186,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3

Yarmolenko and Konoplyanka being no better signings than Aspas is a bit off though. 

They're vastly more proven given the fact that they've both been playing on the biggest stages and against much bigger clubs, unlike Aspas who's played one season in la liga. They'd both also be playing in a position that could do with strengthening so they're highly likely to get more than 5 minutes playing time. 



We don't need a third striker and our biggest weak point is LB, we have one at the club and he's been injured all season. RB we can arguably deal with just using what we have in McLaughlin and Flanagan unless Johnson does leave and then it's unlikely we will be spending big on one. Allen doesn't need replacing either.

true,satanspanties,,President of the Official Stellar Tortoise FC Fan Club,"I finished my collection of Oscar Wilde's short fiction with [*Lord Arthur Saville's Crime and other Stories*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/122646.Lord_Arthur_Savile_s_Crime_and_Other_Stories) and *Poems in Prose*.  I loved the titular story of the former, and its implications about free will vs. destiny.  I also enjoyed the other three stories, although the ending of *The Canterville Ghost* was somewhat at odds with the beginning, it felt almost like two halves of two stories shoved together.  *Poems in Prose* I also enjoyed, I find it amazing how some writers can tell a story in so few words.  Anyway, Wilde's works are in the public domain, so you can check them out in your browser window [here](http://www.oscarwildecollection.com/), or download in various formats from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page).

I also read [*The Great Gatsby*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4671.The_Great_Gatsby), which I was pleasantly surprised by.  Often shorter classics can be overhyped because they're so widely read, but I enjoyed this.  I wasn't overly familiar with the plot before I picked it up, so that helped, I think.

I also read [*Animal Farm*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7613.Animal_Farm), which I think is a bit heavy handed in its allegory to the more modern reader.  That being said, most people, myself included, come to it know what the book has to say, which may make it seem more blunt than it really is.  I think it's worth a read, especially considering how short it is, but it's not by any stretch of the imagination mind-blowing.

Some sci-fi next with [*The Day of the Triffids*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/530965.The_Day_of_the_Triffids).  I'm not sure how I felt about this one.  I enjoyed it, but I definitely found it unlikely that society would break down quite so quickly if the majority of the population were to go blind.  Necessary plot device, I suppose.

**This paragraph contains spoilers, for those reading on subpar mobile apps.**  Next up was [*Fool Moon*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91477.Fool_Moon), the second book of The Dresden Files.  Obviously, with a name like that, it was about werewolves, a creature that modern media and the extinction of actual wolves in Britain have ruined for us.  The main threat, to be fair, was legitimately quite a creature, but did we really need so many different types of others to appear in the story?  Also, seriously, [gratuitous death much?](/spoiler)  I know it was meant to demonstrate the real danger that Dresden is allowing Murphy to be exposed to without the wherewithal to defend herself, but [the death of Carmichael was more than enough for that](/spoiler).  My final rating was about what I had anticipated, but for very different reasons.

And finally, [*The Hobbit*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5907.The_Hobbit).

true,DocAverage,null,null,"Heres a walking plan that should take you about 3-4 hours:

* Assuming a starting point of Waverley Station, climb Scott Monument (about £3, 30-45mins). Amazing views (right to the sea!) and it'll help you get your bearings.
* Cross the bridge and go up Cockburn Street- explore the steps and wynds if you fancy it, and end up on the Royal Mile (like 10/15 mins)
* Turn right, head slowly up the Royal Mile, passing St Giles Cathedral and the Council Chambers. Make sure to look up for interesting architecture and don't miss the secret closes behind the main street (but avoid the shops or cafes as they can be tourist traps). Pay attention to all the Statues of great philosophers and writers like Hume, Adam Smith etc (about 30 mins)
* Make sure to save your spit for the Heart of Midlothian next to St Giles!
* Eventually you'll reach the Castle Esplenade- More amazing views, personally I'd give the castle itself a miss, but many will disagree (about £20 I think?).  
* Cut down the steps into the Grassmarket (5 mins)- A good mix of places to eat/drink for tourists/visitors (can be wee bit pricey but). Also interesting shops (Avalanche Records, Analogue Books, Red Door Gallery, Armstrong Vintage Clothes, many many others)
* Now, if you like grimey, dark, yet interesting and unique architecture, head along the Cowgate- if you want to see the wee dug, head up Candlemaker Row, you'll also be next to the Museums and the University (this is a really good place to eat/drink- less tourists, more students, great variety)
* Or, stick to the royal mile, and muddle your way to the very bottom, where the Scottish Parliament, Holyrood Palace and Arthurs Seat are. You could also visit Adam Smiths grave if your interested. Personally I love the Parliament, especially the landscaping around it- on certain days (Fridays I think?) you can visit for free. 

Other things that are good if your looking for photos:

* Scotsman Steps by Martin Creed/ the Bridges next to them
* Old College and nearby Dovecot Studios (think its free too)
* The Mound and the galleries there (free)
* about a thousand other things I can't think of right now!

I am sure LvG is on the list for United but i would imagine that Klopp is on top of the list and a few other managers may be on the list above LvG.

United want to get someone who has the ability to be at the club long term (United long term, not PL long term which are two different things) which isn't LvG.  So i think LvG is viewed as the patch that could get them to the long term solution, but i think they will try for the manager that is a potential long term solution before they try for LvG.

You would effectively be removing Sherwood because of inexperience as the manager.  But to then put him in the DoF slot over a expereinced and respected DoF, you would effectively be doing the same thing to him as you did as a manager.

Not to mention, you would effectively be telling Tim he wasn't good enough to be the manager but then putting him in DoF (position by the design of a DoF  alignment with more influence on the team than manager) you would make him LvG's boss....would never work.

Go ahead and offer him his old job back (Technical Director), if he doesn't want it, then wish him luck as manager in the Championship.

&gt; Violent insurgents typically start out as peaceful, idealistic, political activists. Whether or not political activists know it, even with very mundane levels of political activity, they are engaging in low intensity conflict with [the state].

&gt; It's only a matter of time before some individuals determine that political activism is a honeypot that accomplishes nothing and wastes their time. The corporate state knows that some small percentage of the peaceful, idealistic, political activists will eventually figure out the game. At this point, the clued-in activists will probably do one of two things; drop out or move to escalate the struggle in other ways.

Islam is, unfortunately, antithetical to much of Western secularism.  Muslims believe that they alone have absolute truth on their side and it seems credible to me that this way of thinking can excuse harm towards others.

Another problem:  Muslims could commit crimes out of poverty.  But why are so many of them so badly off?

I suspect that the reason is in part because Islam runs counter to acceptance of modern science and knowledge.  Over the past few centuries the Islamic world has essentially contributed nothing of lasting value to science, technology, literature, music, painting or any of the arts.  BTW, I don't for one second believe this is because of race.  Steve Jobs was ethnically Syrian.  The nobel prize winner Abdus Salaam was Pakistani (and was considered an outcast by many Pakistanis for his religious views).

Both the intellectual and financial poverty of Muslims is in large part due to their inability to adapt and change to new ideas.  If you believe that your 6th century book is a revelation of the absolute truth then you will remain in the 6th century.

And of course, Islam treats women as second class citizens.  Holding back women's progress is possibly doing untold damage to their society.  

No, not all Muslims break the law - but perhaps the effect of their ideology is strong enough to tip the scales enough to explain the discrepancy we're witnessing.",1,1396104774,null,0,false,0,cgexc8k,t3_21nvov,t1_cgexc8k,t1_cgex43b,null,1433120650,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

I don't know if you've been paying attention, but we've moved on a lot since then.  The Western world has gone through a period of scientific and cultural enlightenment.  We even have gay marriage.  

And where is the Muslim world?  Much of it is lagging *centuries* behind.  In many Muslim countries you would face the death penalty for homosexual acts or for being an atheist.  I think that's a problem which needs to be talked about.

Edit:  I wonder if any of the people downvoting me are aware of what many homosexuals think about the Islamic views on homosexuality?  Or is your fear of being called a racist for criticizing Islam greater than your desire to defend the principle that homosexuals should have equal rights?

Is it OK that many Islamic societies punish homosexuality by death, because to criticize Islam would be 'intolerant'?

Is it OK that an estimated 66000 women in the UK have undergone genital mutilation (with no successful prosecutions) because, hey, it's their culture?

Is it OK that it's impossible to be an atheist in many Muslim societies, because the punishment for apostasy is death?

However, I don't think they particularly regarded LGBT equality as an important priority, and they had to be badgered into passing a lot of the legislation they did get through.  The equalisation of the age of consent, gender recognition, and allowing LGB people to serve in the military only got off the ground following losses for the government in the European Court of Human Rights, the extension of anti-discrimination laws to cover sexual orientation was grudgingly tacked onto another bill following backbench pressure, and they only went ahead with civil partnerships because Lord Lester was embarrassing the government by trying to introduce them via a Private Members' Bill.",0,1396105771,null,0,false,0,cgexnlp,t3_21msv7,t1_cgexnlp,t1_cgeuvo1,null,1433120798,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Meh. You can also suffer emotional trauma when you discover your partner is already married, lied about his job, is gay or simply decides to leave you for any single arbitrary reason they want. It takes two people to have a relationship or make a baby, so it's not like you can 100% blame the agent. He didn't force a woman to fall in love with him or have his child. Yes it was under false pretences, but so are many many relationships.

I also fail to see how it's sexist. I'm sure that we send plenty of young sexy female spies to get information from rich old guys too.

People also fly tip a lot. It's hard to catch them.

Also, the streets are destroyed every weekend night with drunks, and you can only clean so much before it gets fucked the next weekend.

There's less of a community feel in the areas you mentioned so people aren't compelled to get together and clean. If you can meet a couple of neighbors who feel the same as you it might be something you can do together.

true,notsoyoungpadawan,null,null,"Firstly, what's really ignorant is to think that the club won't be prepared to sell anyone for the right price. Just because you don't want it to happen does not mean it won't happen.

Secondly, if you had actually thought about the situation instead of raging out, you'd have realized that I wasn't ""throwing Drogba and Lukaku together like father and son"", rather suggesting that there is a possibility that an experienced former world-class striker who was unplayable on his day could return to coach young and inexperienced strikers. 

You don't think Lukaku's work-rate is low? Then you've obviously only watch videos of his goals and not really full matches. 

&gt;You wanna know what helps consistency? You want to know what helps that? Game time. Not on loan

Firstly, that's completely incorrect because Lukaku tends to get involved with goals in almost every match. He has 4 goals and an assist in 6 matches and doesn't tend to go more than a match without at least a goal or an assist. That's not inconsistent and that's not what I was talking about. Secondly... Courtois.

&gt;Do you see any sort of hype around a player that we could realistically get our hands on that is anywhere near as proven as Lukaku? Hell no. Why are so many of you fans jumping on the thought of selling him?

Once again.. Nobody is ""jumping at the thought of selling him"". Stop being so over-dramatic. But if selling him means we will be able to purchase a better striker who is already world-class, then hell yes I'd be ok with selling him. And realistically, there are at least 2 or 3 better strikers we could fund by selling Lukaku. I hope you understand the situation better now.

&gt;I don't understand why we'd sell Lukaku to keep Eto'o

Where have I said that?

&gt;To sell off a future star just because of his 'emotion', or his 'workrate'? Even though both complaints are just made up excuses?

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; I rather imagine my gf (or indeed any self respecting person) would be more dismayed by your paternalistic, condescending and simplistic understanding of a person's agency. The very idea of presenting someone with an option seems to offend you. Frankly I'm astonished that the prospect of saying ""would you like to try x"" is so shocking to you. I mean, in essence, that's what all of this is about.

Because it isn't about you presenting a choice and saying *would you like to try drink X* I at least *assume* she's of a legal age, so at the very least when she feels like she's *really* ready to try a drink, she's got enough command of the vcabulary to say ""Hey you know what? I will have a drink - what do you suggest that would fit with my pallete?"" But no. No you've taken it upon yourself to decide that she *needs* to drink - *that* my friend is beyond the pale. 

&gt; Wonderful. I suppose by your slippery slope logic goes drinking &gt; smoking &gt; heroin &gt; crack &gt; full on Requiem for a Dream type stuff &gt; death. 

Because by *your* logic, Teetotal = unsociable and dull, which as someone who has come through the other side of a drink problem, has a real issue with *anyone* pushing *anything* that a person just *may not be into* - People smoke pot sociably. People smoke sociably. It's not a massive leap.

&gt; Amazing. Presenting a choice isn't choosing for somebody. From your very first comment you've been firing on all cylinders on the assumption that this has been about ""forcing"" someone to do something. It's more about giving someone the opportunity to arrive at an informed opinion. If this was about anything else then you may not have reacted so hysterically but the alcohol aspect seems to have put you in a bit of a tizz. Well, shit, there's not a lot I can do about your conservative approach to the matter at hand, suffice to say that I think adults living in the 21st century ought to be able to take a more sensible and relaxed approach to the whole thing.

Because you're not getting it's *her* choice - it's *her* body, and just like everything else with her body, it's *her* decision what she puts into it - you have no right to suggest something unless she *asks* you to, period.",0,1396110811,null,0,false,0,cgezf3q,t3_21n9fy,t1_cgezf3q,t1_cgeyzdx,null,1433121629,3,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,3
