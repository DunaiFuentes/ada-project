However, with Chadli playing a wide attacker, and especially given he's our single only consistent source of goals this season, he's already being marked. Yes, he would be marked tighter as a striker, but he'd be marked more by players he could outrun. As is, he's more often than not followed into the box by a fullback. Most of his goals though arise from him popping up in situations in a compacted box, in which there's less man-marking anyway.

I loved Ba but he was above his level at Chelsea. We still had some creativity issues but people forget that Rooney is a pretty creative striker and that's the reason he plays at CAM. He'd scored so much more for United if he played up top. We were 4 points off the title last year and I'm sure Rooney would have been gotten us those 4 points if not more. 

In the long run, it's better we got Costa because even though he's not as proven as Rooney (he's having a great start though), he's 3 years younger.

Usually it's not worth the hassle of becoming VAT registered until your turnover meets the threshold, which is £70,000 - £80,000 per year, depending on the type of business. That's because although you save money by not having to pay VAT, the reporting and recording requirements are much more stringent -- so much so that you'd probably need to employ someone part-time to handle that side of things, thus negating any financial benefits.

Once you do start employing someone else for any reason, then all sorts of regulations start kicking in.

Additionally you might want to consider forming a limited company. Any solicitor can do this for you for a couple of hundred quid. Again, there are stricter reporting requirements once you've done this, but nothing as bad as being VAT registered, and it protects your personal assets in the event everything goes horribly wrong with the business.

false,APeacefulWarrior,null,null,"But honestly, the vast majority of SECULAR historians agree there was almost certainly a real Historical Jesus who said\did at least some of the things that are attributed to Jesus in the Bible.  This isn't a matter of what religions believe.  Those who claim there was no Jesus at all are very small minority from *any* perspective.

This is absolutely regardless of any religious claims.  This doesn't mean Historical Jesus had magic powers or was the Son of God.  Just that there was once a wandering Rabbi (we think) named Yeshua who got nailed to a tree for saying everyone should be nice to each other for a change.  Then whatever Historical Jesus did ended up being rewritten over the next 200 years to produce the Mythological Jesus that's recorded in the Bible.

Besides, the key problem with the ""there was no Jesus"" theory is that those who advance it cannot put forward the slightest bit of concrete proof of where Jesus came from if he wasn't a real person.  It would have required a deliberate conspiracy to invent him, and there is no proof whatsoever of this.  Especially since within about 60 years of his (reported) death, Jesus was being mentioned in documents *not* written by Christians.

Find the Lost Epistle of Paul where he talks about what suckers those Corinthians were, and you might have an argument.  Without such a document, it's an empty historical theory because it gives no better causative explanation.

Occam's Razor alone suggests there was likely a real Jesus who became the seed of the later mythology.  It's the simplest explanation, and it doesn't require handwaving away generally reliable historical sources like Josephus or postulating a conspiracy on the part of the apostles  to invent Jesus.

Edit: For that matter, the idea of real-life humans becoming elevated to godhood by later mythology / revisionism is hardly a new idea.

If its the former, you might be able to deal with them rationally.  If its the latter, I guess its difficult.

As the owner of the vehicle, I guess you might be able to serve some sort of notice on the the yard to allow you access - which might eventually mean employing a vehicle collection company to go and get it (I'm sure they will just drag the other cars out of the way)  Personally this all seems like it could get very messy to me

What makes this any different than that of what the social sphere deems fit for news, in the modern age? It's all garbage and unrelated facts... For when at one point the Americans were praising Dickens for his good work; they had rejected Nixon for lying on Television. In a plausibility he [Nixon] was telling the truth about Watergate, yet he may or may not appeared to been lying.

Hence, the resigned nature of Nixon's career. However, we see Reagan, an actor mind you learn from his predecessors mistakes... Using the Television as FDR did the radio, and most likely imitating Kennedy in the Nixon/Kennedy debates.

The United Kingdom suffers the same social morality play that is ""Brave New World"" written by the 'Aldous Huxley' who had brought to life ""The Doors of Perception"", which in all happenstance had become symbolic in the 60s - 70s I.E. "" The British Invasion,"" in America, at the time. The story, written in the '30's' predicts a tale that is of a world dominated by television and pleasure. Where the youth happened to be desensitized by acts of a sexual nature, by nulling and voiding love... Which this it is safe to say, the West as a society, a whole, a region has accepted non-else but Hedonism/and-or/Communism...

Suicide. Why? Because we love to watch others suffer. Hence the reality drama post Shakespearean epitaphs.

Why does this all matter? Simple. We are the pleasure seeking folks described in the very tales we were raised to be opposed to... What are we really? Shall we continue in the vein of Hippocrates? Or shall we learn to accept, no claim rather; suffering, as did ""The Savage"" in *Brave New World*.

Verbs of action don't contain this equation and therefore don't maintain the subjective case outside of the subject.

Also, ""with"" as a preposition always sets off objective case, therefore changing the personal pronoun forms. 

""Who is going with us?"" 

* who = Interrogative pronoun
* is = auxiliary verb
* going = present participle (forming progressive)
* with = preposition (forming an adverbial prepositional phrase)
* us = pronoun, object of preposition (with ""with"" forming the prepositional phrase)

Whereas the ""this is us/we"" is a different type (equation) rather than a progressive action. Also, as I pointed out, the descriptive ""this is us"" is fine because it's been used so commonly, yet ""this is we"" is prescriptively correct.

Look at the dramatic phrase ""I AM HE, WHO yada yada yada"", ""he"" maintains subjective case because of the intrinsic equation of linking verbs.

I am not saying that problems do not exist but I do not see how you can blame the previous generation for all of this. It was a different time then; 50 years ago the world population was less than half of what it is right now (Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population). The world is increasingly more globalized which allows rich people to seek opportunity in far away places at the touch of a finger. You complain about property prices; they were almost half what what they are right now less than 5 years ago. Their current value is not because the previous generation is now suddenly investing all their magnificent pensions into the property market; its because the whole world is investing in property now. Most premium properties in Britain are not even British owned right now. 

&gt;No, it's more like saying the well off neighbour should share some of his wealth with those less fortunate. No one is 'self made' you all rely on the infrastructure and security your taxes pay for. It stands to reason that if one person is hugely successful that requires other people to miss out on that. Why not help provide them with a decent standard of living in respect for there slightly worse luck?

The tax system is designed for this. Contrary to what people believe, the rich pay a lot more taxes than what we are led to believe. Yes, some people try their best to evade taxes, its nothing new and besides, it has got nothing to do with the topic at hand. 

&gt;Okay - reasonable critique: How am I meant to earn enough to provide for my pension if my living costs are 2/3 of my income while at the same time saving to purchase a house, which I am very unlikely never going to be able to pay the mortgage off when I do retire thus cannot use its value to prop up my meager savings?

I don't know the answer to that. Owning a property is hard even for people earning decent money right now. While the job market has improved, the property market has climbed significantly more due to foreign investment into Britain. I can only hope that it comes down and the government does something about it but I still don't see how the previous generation was responsible for this. Every working person has been fucked by the property market right now. Its not unique to you, me or any other working person. Home ownership is not a British problem; it has been a worldwide phenomenon for a few decades now. In my opinion, the reason why the British are so vocal about the situation is that buying a house is such a big part of culture and a means of self-validation here.

Our discussion has gone quite off topic here. The whole point of my original message was not to invalidate the existence of problems that clearly exist within the society, many of which you have pointed out yourself.

Two saucepans. Spuds in one, cut into quarters, sixths if they're big. Veg in the other. Quarter a couple of the carrots and parsnips lengthwise.

Start cooking the spuds and veg when you put the chicken and pigs in blankets in to roast.

Ten minutes in, fish a few spud pieces and the lengthwise veg out, cover them in melted butter and either a bit of soy sauce, or some honey. Stick 'em in the oven.

Do the stuffing up and stick that in the oven too.

Turn the veg down until it's simmering very gently. The spuds need to stay on a low boil.

50 minutes later, your roast dinner for, how many? Three? Six? 20? is done. Mash the spuds with butter and pepper. DO NOT CREAM. Creamed mash is not British. British mash has lumps in.

Here's the [wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide) on it.

But really use the /r/SkincareAddictionUK [wiki on niacinamide](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/wiki/ingredients/niacinamide).

Here's the review thread of [niacinamide](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/comments/2gvut7/the_niacinamide_reviews/) (split up by brand). You'll see it's in lots of products from sunscreens, toners, moisturises, and gels, etc.

I have been using **Freederm gel** (4% niacinamide) and cutting it into my lotion. My review of it can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/comments/2gvut7/the_niacinamide_reviews/clul4ei).

FYI:

1. You can get this 4% nicinamide gel on the NHS if you do want to go the gel route. It is cheaper per ml than **Freederm gel** although **Freederm gel** is £5 for a tube, so if you wanted to just sample it, you're better off getting it from Boots than getting a prescription for £8.

2. Niacinamide doesn't play well with acids. It can make your skin red and puffy. Do not layer an AHA/BHA over it. *No bueno!*

It’s not so tin-foil-hat to *believe* the media hype that there’s an ever increasing class divide between those who ‘have’ and ‘have not’ – with an ever increasing fear that if you’re knocked off the ladder, you won’t be getting back on it without help. 

We’re becoming increasingly introverted as a nation, wrapped up red tape and inability to get things done. Scientifically and from an IT point of view we have some fantastic feathers in our bow but they’re not given nearly enough ‘air time’. 

We do have an immigration problem – but heaven help those who point it out. We have finite wealth, jobs, resources, homes to accommodate the population of the country and that’s going to put a strain on things that will only increase with great immigration. We should be buckling down and cherry picking the best people to come here, not opening the doors to anyone who can meet minimum requirements. There are already findings that non-EU immigration is a drain, not a benefit to the country. However we also need to fight public opinion of immigrants in general and turn it in to a positive (which only works if it IS a positive).

But what I agree with most of all is that we keep being pushed in little ways and expected to bear this brunt. There is no major shake-up. Students marched and rioted in London and what changed? The fee increase remains. People protest fracking but AFAIK it’s still going ahead. 

The future looks less than optimistic, I can’t help but wonder if something will break sooner or later – and hopefully sooner.

Wealth inequality is increasing fast - we're already approaching levels last seen before WWI. It's inevitable that, without taxation on wealth, the problem will get worse.

It is believed that the decontamination lasted at least five minutes, and the staff member wore surgical gloves of the kind used by medical staff in Ebola-torn West Africa.

Again I agree – the icing on the cake being we’re made to feel uneasy about even saying these things. It’s a taboo to imply that any one demographic are soley benefitting from ‘big society’. 

It’s strange. Growing up I never really felt like my government or country told me I should make sacrifices, make way, act a certain way because it would be awful to be anything but positive and welcoming. 

Now that’s changed and that’s what we get told over and over. On me at least it’s having the opposite effect and making me think ‘Why? What’s being done for me? What benefit is this to me?’

Also, when they make money on these big houses, who is paying the extra? the next buyer who has even more money, their gain does not cost your average joe a penny. Wealth inequality is being created by income discrepancies, rising house prices are merely a symptom.

the wealth tax being proposed makes absolutely no sense, targets people randomly and unfairly, adds a layer of complexity to an already hard to follow tax system

I'm all for a balanced and even somewhat redistributive tax system, but you can't tax someone on a profit they have yet to make.

Next we get to the practical issue of how these properties are to be valued. at purchase price? (which doesn't account for the value gain which you're saying is the real issue) on a valuation? whose? are we then going to spend most of the tax on paying whoever made the valuations? 

Then there is the issue that most will simply sell at the price below the tax line and be able to snap up an equally nice house for the exact same price because everyone else with that kind of house will also want to avoid the tax

For me the taxes are going to have to be on income because it's where the inequality is created, a wealth tax is a sticking plaster that isn't going to work while costing £££ to implement.

false,RedofPaw,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"In many ways I agree with the sentiment of what you are saying. If we were to look at a different subject - racism - then we can see how 'casual racism' can be problematic, just as overt racism is. 

But it's worth considering that this is not an all-or-nothing, black and white issue. Taylor wore a shirt created by a female designer, no doubt in respect and admiration of her work as an artist. That seems like a pretty nice thing to do - and indeed to showcase it on TV could be seen as a benefit to her work. 

Of course that doesn't really go to the argument of whether that was an appropriate place to wear that specific shirt. Indeed a kids birthday party may be another place perhaps? But I guess we're getting into weird hypotheticals at this point. 

&gt;One particular problem with your line of argumentation here is that it can be applied to any particular issue brought up to highlight the issues that women face.

No, no, it was a judgement of this specific event, rather than all issues. Indeed I specifically said that this specific target was 'ridiculous'.

&gt;Complaining about a sexy shirt? Well that's trivial: we just landed on a comet!

That wasn't what I said. Indeed the landing on a comet is irrelevant to the issue in my mind. His work and the fine, amazing work that it is, has no bearing on whether his other actions are appropriate or not.

The guy was representing an official body and if they have an issue with someone they employ dressing in a particular way then I guess there would be an employment issue there, or indeed a PR one, and I am sure this situation has gone the way it has specifically because of complaints levelled at them. I think it's clear that the guy himself regrets his decision to wear the shirt, due to the fallout it has caused and and indeed he recognises the issues it raises. He seems genuinely upset that any action he has taken has upset people, when it's clear that his decision to wear the shirt has nothing to do with sexism, nor a casual sexism levelled at women. He must feel awful to be accused of such things and I am sure he feels just as bad, if not worse about the situation as anyone.

Additionally, to pick up on the issue of campaigners, it's not as if people against poor representation of women can only target one issue at once either - they can target the small and large at the same time.

Indeed I have no problem with the comments that were against the shirt - people can have their opinion!

However, it is MY opinion, and purely that, that the shirt was not 'guilty' of the 'crimes' it was being accused of. 

&gt;Complaining about being told they can't drive properly? Fuss over nothing.

Well, that would be offensive to me. Plenty of women can drive really well. Great, even! But you seem to be employing some kind of slippery slope logic. 

&gt;Women not paid as much as men for sport? 

That's an interesting topic! People should discuss that. I didn't mention it though and nothing I said could possibly suggest any of the issues you mention are not important.

You seem to have either accidentally or wilfully misunderstood my point.

&gt;A very significant factor in sexism etc. in society is that it's not just ""one thing"" but a myriad of small issues that roll into one big one. 

That's a very good point, and I do not disagree. 

For me it comes down to breaking up the issue into parts:

-Was this shirt appropriate for a professional setting? In retrospect it appears that Taylor and the ESA have decided it was not. I suspect people in the same situation will consider their wardrobe more carefully in the future.

-Was any this SPECIFIC shirt the unacceptable part. In terms of the ESA and a press conference I think there are people who feel that he should have 'dressed up' more appropriately regardless of the shirt. But I do understand how some might have a problem, not with the professional status of print-shirts, but with the specific imagery. Perhaps there is other imagery that would also prompt a response, but it was this imagery that engendered a specific and vociferous response. I guess we get into hypotheticals again if we try to imagine all the different imagery that might cause some kind of offence.

-Was the shirt offensive to women in general - should no one wear it? The guy was wearing a print shirt by a female artist. It seems to me that the INTENTION of the shirt is not sexist. The content of the shirt is also not explicit. It comes down to taste - and the charge that it is tasteless in it's depiction of women. The fact the creator was a woman goes to the intention, but perhaps not the overt effect. In any case I think it's safe to say that no one is calling for a shirt like this to be outlawed. If I saw a person wearing the shirt I might question their fashion sense, but (especially knowing the artist in question was a female) I would not automatically assume sexism on the part of the wearer. 

-It comes down then to this guy's position - should he be wearing it in a public setting? (I know it seems like I am going over this point repeatedly, but I am coming at it from different angles). It's clear that he now feels he should not. 

So... after all that we have established that NO - in context of that particular media event - it was probably not a good idea to wear it. 

BUT I personally feel - again, just my opinion - that the shirt itself is NOT sexist.

This comes back to my original point: it is not black and white. It is not a TAKE ALL or DIE situation.

So, in discussing this as a 'target' for those who would campaign against sexism (I am against sexism personally) - perhaps I was less nuanced in what I wrote than what I intended. In any case the way in which Taylor was attacked over the shirt was similarly lacking in nuance and understanding. 

&gt; choice of comment and the fact that he thought those things would be ""OK"" to say on a live TV stream

Can you clarify what comment was the problem? The comments appear to have been:

-“The people I work with don’t judge me by my looks but only by the work I have done and can do. Simple.”
Sounds fair to me. 

-“the sexiest mission there’s ever been. She’s sexy, but I never said she was easy.”
Seems like he was joking - and a fairly innocuous joke as well. Maybe I'm missing something? I am not sure I'd say it about a woman, but... he wasn't saying it about a woman.

&gt; You can't tackle the big one without taking on the little ones.

Of course. But it was more than 'talking' about this guy's shirt. His shirt did not prompt a civil 'discussion', at least not alone - it prompted a response to Taylor that was over the top and unwarranted. Maybe the squeeky wheel gets the oil? 

My original point was that by making such a loud noise about such a 'little' thing it distorts the issues and makes those attacking him seem to be focussing not only on the wrong thing, but doing so in a way that appears disproportionate and mean spirited.

The guy cried. Is that enough? Is that good? 

This is not about 'tone policing' - it's about a civil discussion and an appropriate response that respects both sides. 

&gt;On a related note: what makes you (a man, I'm guessing? I am too, for the record) think that you are the arbiter of what women should find important, in their efforts to push back against inherent sexism and the surrounding issues? 

I am not the arbiter. It was my personal opinion, and purely that. We are all welcome to our opinions of course, just as you are yours. I would like to think you can see my responses here are reasoned and in no way malicious and an discussion can be had. You are of course free to disagree. 

I believe to target a shirt - worn in no way out of sexism or malice - and charge it as offensive so fervently was stupid. I believe that a person who is serious about the subject at hand would have the clarity to confront issues in a nuanced and thoughtful manner. I believe that such a response has and will cause a backlash, especially when the target of that ire is seen to be crying on tv. 

Meanwhile, I am indeed a man, and I would like to think that I have the empathy to put myself in the position of another human being enough to comprehend why they might be upset about a shirt. I do understand why. But I disagree with the response. They are welcome to have one, and indeed free to respond in any way they see fit. I am free to suggest that perhaps the response was a poor one and counter productive. 

In terms of the issues of inherent sexism and surrounding issues, I think I have repeated my point that I believe the response to this 'little' issue does not help the larger goal.

&gt;Why do you get to decide what they should or should not complain about?

I get to 'decide' nothing. All I can do is give my opinion. You are free to disagree with those, as you have done. 

&gt;less than 10 minutes later and there's a downvote.

I've only just seen your comment, but complaining about downvotes will only attract more. You cannot stop downvotes, unfortunately, even those given against reddiquet (don't downvote opinions you disagree with). Either you care if you get them, in which case it's best not to complain about it (you'll only get more), or you learn not to care about it.  Alternatively they may well have downvoted you for legitimate reasons, in which case complaining is a futile act.

Even assuming this doesn't happen, there are four headwinds we face, same as in the US - demographics, education, inequality, and government debt (see this link in r/economics - http://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/2lvoa0/brookings_us_economic_growth_is_over_the_short/ )

What that means is that wages aren't going to rise very much. And what that does is put us in a situation like in the 19th century, where returns to capital outstripped the rise in earnings. And that lead to increasing concentration of wealth in the hands of a very few.

That eventually lead to mass unrest, revolution, and two world wars (which destroyed capital and created a situation in the late 20th century that we somehow convinced ourselves was the default).

We need to tax wealth because otherwise the mechanics of the market will mean that wealth concentrates more and more. We are already in the situation where the top few % own a huge amount of wealth, and the bottom 50% virtually nothing.

We have to tax something in order to get the country to run (schools, hospitals, roads, military). Wealth is the perfect thing to tax in a capitalist society.

In general terms where a double taxation treaty exists you shouldn't be taxed twice on income earned. The specifics are complex, though.

If the latter, your UK employer should only use your earnings with them as the basis of your taxation, unless your HMRC coding notice tells them otherwise (which I guess would be unlikely in this case).

&gt;Wealth tax is better than capital gains because capital gains is higher the more effectively you invest. So actually disincentives productive investment. It's also intermittent and relatively easy to fudge.

no because unless the tax is 100% they still make money on it, and wouldn't you want disincentivise using property as an investment anyway? and if you think capital gains is easy to fudge implementing this will be entertaining for you to watch.

&gt;We need to tax wealth because otherwise the mechanics of the market will mean that wealth concentrates more and more. We are already in the situation where the top few % own a huge amount of wealth, and the bottom 50% virtually nothing.

This won't solve wealth inequality though. if owning that expensive a house costs a significant enough amount to address the inequality then people will go live in a £950k house rather than a £1m house

Long story short (and no fucking surprise whatsoever), indulge yourself in Mediterranean cuisine and you'll be a happy little piggy with good health, nice hips, and no muffin top. Olive oil, vegetables, fruit, pulses, fish, and of course nuts! Go nuts!

By the by, this ain't far off my own diet - out of choice, not dietary zeal - and it's a mystery and a crying shame that so many Brits have weaned themselves off food and onto appalling processed shite, to the point that they would find *actual identifiable foodstuffs* completely unpalatable.

This is not a published, peer-reviewed journal article on the effect of sanctions, but as far as I know, nobody has produced one. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation come closest with regular reports on all things to do with benefits and poverty.

You may be sceptical of them since they're a charity, but if you want to look, here's their most recent publication on benefits.

http://www.jrf.org.uk/publications/welfare-sanctions-and-conditionality-uk

The blog linked by OP is a memorial to people who have suffered from benefit sanctions, and aimed to make the reader think. *Is this situation fair?* It gives this takeaway:

&gt; By choosing to not provide unconditional benefits, we create holes for people to fall through to their deaths. And for every one who dies, there are hundreds and even thousands more who suffer.

&gt; Our best intentions do not matter. There is no perfect test. Whatever the test, there are those who should pass it who won't, and therefore there will always be those who should not suffer who will.

&gt;The only way to truly help someone, is to give help unconditionally.

&gt; If we can't do that, if we can't help our fellow human beings without first asking what they can do for us first, we turn our backs to each other and to a better world.

&gt; Let us all stop the tolling of conditional welfare, and make it unconditional.

What do you think about that point, that a **conditional** safety net, is no real safety net at all? Imagine if airbags in a car were conditional, that only work as long as you've not gone over the speed limit. Doesn't that sound ridiculous?

returns to capital, or investment income. I'm talking about money in when I say income, not their paycheque. if an investment gains money when sold that's income and can be taxed at scource rather than before it's realised. If wealth gain is the problem you target wealth gain and not wealth itself

honestly no, if we were doing a tax on every house it could be useful, more expensive properties tend to be unique or rare so a fair comparison becomes difficult

going rate is £200 plus VAT if you want them with any professional accountability.

correct, along with more checks on the efficiency of government spending. After all it's not like you can have more money for having an expensive house until it is sold or rented.

Gravy browning.

Place mince and veg in the bottom of a heatproof dish and cover with mashed potatoes, grate cheese over potatoes and put in the over for 30-45 mins on about 180 deg C.

While the Labour Party in its present form is not ideal, their policies themselves are not *idealist*. This means, that unlike the Greens, or the other socialist parties, Labour represents a genuine party of governance for the whole of the UK and not just a small fraction.

Adding to that, there are still a great number of more 'hardline' leftist thinkers within the Labour Party, many of whom are still sitting on the green benches of the commons. This means that there is still to be found a wealth of mixed opinion and debate within the main stem of the party. Indeed, most of the individual members hold views far more closely aligned with mine than those of the current front bench. This debate is fundamentally a good thing with some of the more recent policy announcements tending to reflect this progressive outlook (although they are often overlooked in favour of simplistic images of Ed eating because it is far easier to attack a man for his looks rather than engaging with his policies).

Reasonable punitive measures that enable the lender (library etc) to mitigate losses in the form of a fine of 20p a day or whatever is both within the contract created when someone obtained their library card/blockbusters membership, and within reasonable measures, which are usually capped at a certain point to the purchase price of the loaned item.

However, fining someone for a bad review is a different matter entirely. You're not in possession of something belonging to someone else. If a library loses revenue because it can't loan a DVD out that you have held onto longer than you agreed to loan it for, its your fault, not theirs. But a review of a hotel is at least as dependent on the hotel as it is on the guest writing the review. Sure, some people will never be satisfied, and sometimes things go wrong that you can't control, like weather and rowdy other guests. But in general, a review will depend on the quality of the product, whether that product is a night in a hotel, a movie, a book, a set of Christmas lights, whatever. A review is telling others what their opinion on a product is, and their experience with that product - with photographic evidence in this case. If the hotel was worried about its reputation and revenue, it should improve its product/service and it will get better reviews and more visitors. Fining people for bad reviews damages its reputation throught the Streisand Effect (or something similar, anyway).

The loss of earnings here is the hotel's fault because it provided an inferior product, not the customer's fault as it would be for a late DVD return.

Also, if a DVD was scratched, and the person who rented it complained to their friends that the library's DVD is scratched and that resulted in people deciding not to rent DVDs from the library any more, that's the library's fault for having scratched DVD(s) - ie, inferior product. The library's response to this, upon being notified, would/should be to replace damaged DVDs and offer customers a refund (since they were unable to use the product they paid for).

I currently earn £31.5k a year and I'm 26. I've got credit card debt due to living In London for a few years on less than market rates (in order to build up my cv). I'm currently at a firm and have been buying stock. When the company has its IPO I will have the option to cash out and it won't be less than £500k. I don't want the government to get 50% of this, they simply don't deserve it in my opinion. 

I will 100% be using tax loop holes to ensure I can keep as much of that cash I can. This is what others are doing that you want to fuck off. Am I being an arsehole? I feel like I already pay more than my fair share as a single male who spends most of his time out of the UK but uses it as a base (I've been in the UK for 2 days in the last 5 weeks and this is fairly normal). I pay Council, income, road tax plus national insurance which in Wales (where I live) has proven to be useless (I found a lump and had to wait 2 months before it was scanned and confirmed to be non cancerous). Combine these expenses with the cost of renting, our ever leaning to the right and our distain for the EU and I don't see a huge amount of reasons to stay 'registered' as living in the UK. I could easily buy a small place in Switzerland and keep more of my earnings whilst renting a place and dropping in once or twice a month (like I do). 

So it's not so much a case of the rich fucking off, most of them travel enough that they can register their domicile as anywhere they please. They opt for the UK because the tax situation isn't too bad. Make huge changes and they will continue to live in the UK but register somewhere else.

 * All businesses can charge a ""penalty"" fee that's a reasonable estimate of their costs from a failure to comply with a contract. This covers things like late fees for delayed return of a car - they're to pay for the business having to pay staff to work late to get the car prepped for the next customer, or to hire a car from a competitor to fulfil their contractual obligations to other customers.

 * Anyone can sue for defamation, and ask the courts to set damages. This route has higher risks attached - we have so-called [""loser pays"" rules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costs_in_English_law) for costs, for example. On the other hand, you can claim for much vaguer things here - loss of potential business is a legitimate thing to claim for in defamation, but not in a breach of contract fee.

Note that the use of penalty fees is often not legal; they've got to be a reasonable estimate of costs incurred, and mustn't include a punishment component.

So, if challenged, this hotel needs to prove that the £100 fee is a reasonable estimate of the costs it incurred from the review - i.e. that any bad review results in them being unable to let a room for an average of 3 nights (given the £36/night fee quoted in the article).

Issue is Labour doesn't know what it is after Brown and Blair, unions wanted it to go back to some its old ways. However there are less industrial jobs and more office/retail industries so maybe unions also fail to address social issues at that level work wise. Not sure also if middle class vote has gone more centre-conservative than centre left. Ed has been talking of a 'cost of living crisis' every time he is interviewed either he's failed to deliver message or no one cares about it at the moment enough. 

More likely given there was a economic crisis maybe people tend to vote more conservative than left after it, because everyone gets jumpy about government spending. This also means Labour cannot boast about past benefit gains like opening up education for poorer students with EMA etc since people are against benefits and government extra spending at the moment. Maybe when economy booms again people might go back to labour since they feel like they have more and feel less cheated out of their own money.

Maybe Labour is Man United of parties at the moment, just after decades of domination they're struggling with keeping up with other clubs.

You know, take a look at this thread. The line of mine you apparently take issue with is one that ends by specifying the bounds of observation as ""in the headline"". Not ""in the article"", just ""in the headline"". That's significant because 99% of people won't read the article, they'll just see the headline, and that little nugget of info will go toward forming their opinion of TripAdvisor. That's not fair, or right. TripAdvisor aren't the bad guys here, the Broadway Hotel is, and yet reference to them is buried within the text (or the 'big fucking pictures', for any infants present) of the article, which relatively few people will read. Broadway Hotel deserve the negative association, not TripAdvisor, and certainly not the act of writing justifiably negative reviews. That's why I highlighted them.

EVERYONE gets the opportunity to apply for permanent residency after they have lived here for 5 years, whether they have come from within the EU or outside. I don't need to include that in my post, it is a FACT.

How?

There have been threads posted with people complaining about it. They just end up getting deleted.

The mods never respond to messages asking why they censor these people.

Ask anywhere outside of /r/unitedkingdom, ask /r/ukpolitics, ask /r/ukipparty, They all claim the same thing.

The only people who don't know about it at this point, are people who don't mind the censorship because they don't like the views being censored. Or people who are so anti-UKIP, they've deluded themselves into thinking that that it's normal for there to be an absolutely consensus that UKIP are evil nazis.

I wouldn't be surprised if this post gets deleted tbh. Most posts mentioning the mods censorship do.

Ahem : I understand that here laws are relaxed and business is pretty liberal-minded compared to places like, say, Italy.
But you affirmation is a bit too... ""extreme""?

&gt; However you will need to submit a personal tax return at the end of each year, the usual advice if you're not experienced at this is to keep every single invoice and receipt and hand it all over to a book-keeper / accountant (along with several hundred quid for their fee) and they'll work out your tax liability.
    
My biz is very simple : I buy 3 seasonal products from italy, I get shipped with a courier and then I sell it.
My expenses are just my 2 cellphones credit, the cost of goods and some little cash for using a carsharing scheme (easily accountable).
From now, I will separate all my business expenses by opening a separate bank account.

    Usually it's not worth the hassle of becoming VAT registered until your turnover meets the threshold, which is £70,000 - £80,000 per year, depending on the type of business. That's because although you save money by not having to pay VAT, the reporting and recording requirements are much more stringent -- so much so that you'd probably need to employ someone part-time to handle that side of things, thus negating any financial benefits.    

Vat is not that complex either. It's simply an account for the VAT you pay and an account for the VAT you charge. Complex?
I wonder how much will it cost me to register. Maintaning the books would be a piece of cake, being such a simple buy/sell business with only one product.

&gt; Once you do start employing someone else for any reason, then all sorts of regulations start kicking in.

No way, I'd rather have contractors. And any way, it feels like it will be a one man show for a long time.

    Additionally you might want to consider forming a limited company. Any solicitor can do this for you for a couple of hundred quid. Again, there are stricter reporting requirements once you've done this, but nothing as bad as being VAT registered, and it protects your personal assets in the event everything goes horribly wrong with the business. If you have a limited company you'll be given a company registration number; you don't need one otherwise.    

Bear In mind that :
1) I just started out
2) I won't be hitting 10k in profits this tax year (I leave the country before I do anyways, lol)

Forming an LLC would mean that I would pay anyways 20% in taxes of my profit. I could pay myself a minimum and pay the rest in dividends (and pay taxes on those anyway), but again : not worth at the moment.

I have a very simple cash flow, I don't need credit or employees.

So you are, at best asking the party's leaders to go against their instincts and their educations. They really have no plan or vision that they could believe in.

On a more practical level the people with the money have a lot of power and the party fears a public relations onslaught about ""balmy socialists"" who will ""destroy the economy"" with their ""madness"".

Thus not only this could provide interesting info about the history of the Moon (and of our planet) but also will improve our drilling technology (something that can be used also outside the astrospace field).

In the case of markets, there seems to be a tendency for a free market to tend towards unfreeness, hence the necessity for legislation.

Today there is already a ""free market"" in the public house property market, and a publican can buy a free house outright and buy beer from any brewery at market rate.

Meanwhile there is also a separate ""free market"" of pubs owned by breweries, and a tenant publican can go work for any one of those breweries which will agree to have him as landlord.

&gt;But it doesn’t need much analysis to realise that the idea that pubcos constantly, cruelly and deliberately exploit their tenants, that they maximise the tenants’ pain for their own gain, is nonsense. The best, most efficient way for a company owning pubs to make the maximum amount of money is to ensure the people running its pubs make the most money they can, too. A failing tenant is no use to any pubco – indeed, every tenancy that fails costs a pubco thousands of pounds, in lost revenue and lost rent, plus all the associated expenses of closing a pub up temporarily, finding new tenants, dealing with the fall-out and so on.

&gt; The call has been made for a mandatory free-of-tie option to be offered to pubco tenants. I can tell you what will happen if that is brought in: large numbers of the best currently tenanted/leased pubs will be turned into managed houses, and those pubs not suitable for a managed operation that look as if they will not bring in an adequate return to their pubco owner as free-of-tie operations will be sold to the highest bidder – likely to be Tesco, Sainsbury’s or Morrisons.

Watch his programmes, coriander goes in and on everything. Search coriander on his website, he has 154 recipes that involve coriander.

Meat: coriander and chilli

Vegetables: coriander and chilli

Fish: coriander and chilli

Fruit: coriander and chilli

Dessert: coriander and chilli

Cornflakes: coriander and chilli    

*My conspiracy theory:*

Jamie Oliver has a dominate share in the global coriander market. He does all he can to get coriander in everybodies home, either by his books and shows, or via 3rd party companies. Anybody who goes against his mission is thoroughly destroyed.

The best example of Oliver's global dominance can be seen in his war against Frozen Turkey Giant Bernard Matthews. After an unsuccessful bid to Bernard Matthews to develop Turkey Twizzlers with a hint of coriander and chilli, Oliver swore revenge. He start his campaign against frozen turkey products, massively damaging the reputation and share prices of the frozen turkey giant. 

Oliver may have also had an involvement in the Bird Flu outbreak at Bernard Matthews farm.

I would share the evidence I have to support this theory, but I have signed a none disclosure agreement with Oliver's solicitors for an undisclosed amount. Lets just say, if you need coriander, I have more then enough to go around.

false,Jukibom,null,null,"Honestly, the bottom line for a lot of people is it's just too expensive. At my last job we got ripped off so much after they hiked their prices (online selling, lots of small ~£10ish products to send out). It used to be anything under 2Kg could be sent second class for about £2.60 given it was a reasonable size. Now, anything over 1Kg is considered a standard parcel - that usually means about £8 and something pence (it's been a while). That just chews into your profits too much and you have to offload it onto the customer which puts you at a perceived disadvantage. Or, you can offer people an alternative cheaper delivery and just end up going to the post office with the occasional parcel for those that need it faster, which is just a bit of a hassle.

Other companies like myHermes (which, for the record, [I'm not particularly fond of](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/25g3g9/anyone_here_use_myhermes_in_the_uk_i_might_have/)) have gotten those rates down. It's in no way a comparable service but most users when given the choice between ~£3 for myHermes and ~£8 for Royal Mail ... well, they'll go for the cheapest one every time unless it's urgent.

But I don't think it's just the prices - it's the complexity. As a business seller, just trying to work out how much something will cost with the Royal mail is an exercise in maddening frustration. There's way too many methods of mailing something now, each with size and weight tiers. The successful delivery companies have gotten that down to pretty much just weight with a simple, flat rate for any variation of parcel. I'm not saying get rid of second class (in fact, bring it back for parcels!) or special delivery or whatever but do we really need (long breath):

**EACH ONE** with a series of giant, granular tables of parcel type (letter / box / tube), weights, compensation levels and parcel sizes. It's just utterly ridiculous and I'm not surprised nobody's bothering to use them. It's impossible to set up any kind of selling rules with this kind target - you need to know the exact dimensions and weight (including cardboard) of every parcel, before it's even packaged with multiple products inside before you can even hope to make a fair estimate of postage costs and even then you'll either end up pushing a buffer price on to the customer (and losing a competitive advantage) or swallow the cost when you inevitably get it horribly wrong.

false,ruizscar,null,null,"&gt; We're not doing that well at all. We have built a mini boom based on housing bubble and increasing personal debt. We are not exporting our way out of the crisis with increasing productivity and increasing pay we are taking the opposite tack.

&gt; Our workers are increasingly less productive than our competitors even though we work longer hours. We have higher levels of personal debt, we have higher levels of public debt than almost all other western countries. We have a massive crisis with the pensioners and baby boomers retiring and placing a humongous strain on the welfare state during an age of austerity and public spending cuts, the cuts have not even begun really. The Tories planned to make most of their austerity budget cuts AFTER the next election. We already have a huge deficit and even bigger national debt, within a couple of years the debt interest payments on the national debt will reach £70-80 billion per year! that is almost as much as the entire defence and education budget and will be added to the deficit.

&gt; The State pension currently costs around £100 billion per year, by far one of the single biggest bills in the budget, 2nd only to the NHS at around £113 billion per year. With all these oldies retiring, by 2040 that state pension bill will be £237 billion per year! and the NHS will be not far off it. With out a massive increase in taxpayers to fund the welfare state and fund the massive numbers of retirees whom outnumber the taxpayers, we're going to see a huge changes to this country.

&gt; So short term? yeah having a ""booming"" housing market in London and the south is pushing GDP into positive territory, but it cannot last, they are always cyclical and that is all we have going for us at the moment.

WTF. Striker**s** - plural.

Sturridge is a long-term injury; we have to prepare for the worst (that he's out for the season) even though we hope he'll be back ASAP.  
Balotelli isn't scoring.  
Borini isn't wanted at the club.  
Lambert can't get a game even with the above factors being true.

If we sign *a* striker in January, we are still only one injury/suspension/needs-a-rest away from being exactly where we are now.

First, where is the money going to come from to do that? If you want 50% going for free do you really think the other parents will be prepared to pay 200% the actual cost of a private education for their children? Of course not.

[EDIT: You probably don't know that the cost of scholarships is not covered by other parents' fees at present. Precisely because parents wouldn't pay. The money comes from foundation investments. Removing charity status would directly limit those investments and thus the ability of schools to provide scholarships.]

More and more will use state schools (draining the fund available to others) and top up with large amounts of tutoring (think how many hours you could buy for £35,000/year^1 or so)--something beginning to happen as traditional users of private schools (eg doctors) are being priced out.

But it also assumes that private schools are the sole reason for their old boys' success. This simply isn't true. A lot of parents think that if they can just get their child into a top school the child will be promised success later in life. Sadly it doesn't work that way.

If you look at the children *starting* at a school like Harrow or Eton they are going in amazingly polished already. Both socially and academically. The precociousness of these 13 year olds is alarming. They don't learn to talk like that, dress like that, behave like that at school.

Nasri was the same year as Aguero. But yeah, we've definitely gone for older, established players in that period, bar a couple of exceptions like Jovetic and Nastasic.

We've spent around £200 million since that summer in 2011, and honestly, what do we have to show for it?

With the possible exception of Fernandinho (on a good day), no player signed during that period is a key player at City, and none of them appear to have a future as a key player (with the possible exception of Mangala, if he fulfils his potential).

£200 million is a lot of money, and we've largely wasted it on mediocrity.

The spine of our title winning side at the beginning of that title winning season 3 years ago in 2011-12, is exactly the same as it is now.

Hart, Kompany, Yaya, Silva, Aguero.

We haven't strengthened.

Now don't get me wrong, that's a very strong spine. But one of those players is past his peak, and needs replacing. While the others aren't getting any younger.

We haven't added to that spine with players of equal ability. We've tried to get away with adding players of reasonable ability into the mix, and when we've gone for real talents who could become additions to that key spine of players (Isco, Hazard), we've failed.

It's crucial that we address this in the transfer market, because we certainly don't have any academy players capable of becoming such a player to the first XI in the immediate future.

&gt; There is, however, a fundamental right for someone to be given the chance to rebuild his or her life at the end of a prison sentence and, on that basis, Swindon should not be demonised for offering McCormick the chance to resume his professional life, particularly if their understanding is correct and he wants to help behind the scenes to educate about the perils of drink-driving. He, like every British citizen, is entitled to work again now he has been through the justice system.

Part of the issues in the Ched Evans case is his refusal to acknowledge his crime and express remorse... he still maintains he was wrongly convicted, whereas McCormick (eventually) wrote to the parents of the children he killed to say sorry.

Evans is partly unlucky that he's come to attention during a national change of mood around sexual assault, so he's become a lightning-conductor for a lot of anger about wider UK society.

No, I didn't say any of that. Kindly put your words in somebody else's mouth next time.

I like your username, by the way.

But on the subject of what I want, it's strikers who, to use Brendan's own language, ""fit the profile"" of a Liverpool striker. That is: players who can play the way Sturridge and Suarez did to such great effect last year. Pacy mobile players who can run on to the passes that Gerrard and Coutinho specialise in. If Brendan wants to stick with a single striker formation, players who thrive in that role. The right *kind* of player. 

What we did in the summer was stock up on players who are completely different from the players we had success with last year, and the result is our current negative goal difference. We need the kind of players who did well for us last year, and we need two of them.

If we can't afford two proven players (and given our massive revenue from selling Suarez, being in the Champion's League and the new TV deal, let alone the fact that money was apparently there for all the big players we failed to sign in the last 3 windows if we could have persuaded them to come) we'll have to go with two or more unproven players.

If anything, it is vital that we as a society *do* allow free debate, *especially* on controversial subjects. Not to do so simply means that the minority whose views are not heard feel oppressed and then become isolated: and that's exactly how extremism is born. 

That's also why (after the European election results) we should be allowing UKIP to join debates with the major parties and air the issues which their voters are concerned about. Not allowing such a debate means that UKIP voters become more passionate UKIP supporters *and* don't get to hear the counter arguments.

If we go into an EU referendum in the next term of Parliament and we *haven't* had those debates, then there won;t be enough time to do it properly. The UKIP voters will vote based on the unchallenged position of UKIP simply because they haven't had time to hear and think about the other arguments.

So he has portrayed the entire left as loonies based on the actions of a few people who may have been loonies or who may have been mis-informed and didn't do research before going up in arms. And who may not have been on the left in politics, for all he knows. They could well include a fair number of paid-up-Tory feminists - he doesn't seem to have checked.

His runs don't need to be direct. They don't need to leave someone with the perfect through ball to play. If they are and it's the right run, great but what's more important is to drag a defence around. It's the base that every attack is built off of. Without that, the midfielders end up standing in front of a wall of defenders with the ball at their feet and we just pass it about until we lose it.


Borini should start nonetheless but this criticism isn't a fair reflection of Lambert as a player. Lambert has shown his ability and usefulness to the side with limited and staggered chances.

Which buses have Free Wi-Fi?

Currently, all Airlink buses, single-deck and double-deck hybrid buses and 15 new single-deck buses have Wi-Fi on board. In terms of fleet numbers, these are:

Service 1 and NightBus (fleet no. 1 to 10) - single deck hybrid buses

Services 21 and 45 (fleet no. 176 to 190) - single deck buses

Service 10 and NightBus (fleet no. 201 to 215) - double deck hybrid buses

Service 30 (fleet no. 11 to 30) - single deck hybrid buses

Social Media Bus (fleet no. 901)

Airlink (fleet no. 939 to 950)

The number of buses currently fitted with Wi-Fi is growing on a weekly basis whilst we roll out this feature across all our buses for the remainder of 2014. Eventually all our buses will have free Wi-Fi available.

It has been proven that Employers N.I. is in fact paid by employees:

in Chile, where high payroll taxes were cut, and the resulting savings were passed on, in full to the employees.

The British government recognises the fact that employers' NI is a tax on employees, either in the form of reduced wages, or in the case of low-paid/minimum wage-level workers, reduced employment (which amounts to less money in employees' hands, since fewer people are employed), and as such has SCRAPPED employer's NI for lower-paid under 21s from next April.

The setting was Christ Church College and around 60 people signed up to attend on Facebook. To be clear: this wasn’t a pro-life demo and the subject wasn’t whether or not women should have the right to choose abortion. Even though I was speaking for the proposition, my speech would’ve begun with noting that the motion has nothing to do with abortion rights per se and was simply a consideration of how having effective abortion on demand affects wider society. Brendan, speaking for the opposition, would've doubtless done a fine job and probably run rings round me. It was a fair and free debate that I half expected to lose.

false,crapshooter153,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"Whites will be an ethnic minority in Britain by the end of the century. Analysis of official figures indicate that, at current fertility rates and levels of immigration, there will be more non-whites than whites by 2100.

It would be the first time in history that a major indigenous population has voluntarily become a minority, rather than through war, famine or disease. Whites will be a minority in London by 2010.

In the early 1950s there were only a few tens of thousands of non-whites in the UK. By 1991 that had risen to 3 million - 6 per cent of the population. The population of ethnic minorities has been growing at between 2 and 4 per cent a year. Net immigration has been running at record levels, with 185,000 newcomers last year.

Government forecasts suggest that immigration on its own will be responsible for half the growth of the British population over the next couple of decades.

New immigrants, who are on average younger than the population at large, also tend to have higher fertility rates. In contrast, the population of white British citizens is static. Their fertility rate is very low - at under 2 children per woman - and there is overall emigration of British citizens.

The analysis of the figures showed that if the population of ethnic minorities grows at 4 per cent a year, whites will become a minority before 2100. The demographer who made the calculation wished to remain anonymous for fear of accusations of racism.

The foul language indicates how sophisticated the protesters were, while the accusation of cissexism had me reaching for my online urban dictionary.

You dislike the outcome of an open forum and you want UKIP to receive special treatment from the moderators to change the outcome of the openness to one that better suits your point of view.

Historically the divide was:

- Working class: Poorly educated, worked with their hands
- Middle class: Well educated, worked with their minds
- Upper class: Well educated, work is optional

That doesn't reflect modern society. Loads more people are educated, manual labour has been automated away to a large extent, and almost everyone works for a living.

To understand modern Britain it's best to rethink class distinctions. I would suggest:

- Working class: Those who earn their money directly through their own efforts. I would include not only the traditional working class, but also people such as teachers, doctors, computer programmers etc. I'd also often include the immediate supervisory layer above them. 
- Managerial class: Those who earn their living largely by talking and directing others.
- Owner class: Those who earn their living through ownership of companies and/or shares.

In a military sense, the first group consists of privates and NCOs, the second group is officers, and the third are Generals, Admirals and Colonels.

Of course, there will always be borderline cases, but if we look at things in the above way, and realise that most of us earn our living fairly directly through our labour, and yet large rewards go to those above us, then it can be seen that we all have a great deal in common.

false,nowitasshole,null,null,"Fair enough, I agree with what you are saying about signing the right kind of player. I still don't see 2 strikers in January as realistic though.

Yes our income looks healthy with CL football and the Suarez sale but I still doubt Rodgers will be given a sizeable January budget. We've just been investigated by FFP and had a £35m outlay in summer. With no guarantee of CL football next season it would be a huge gamble to go and spend big. I hope the owners still have faith in Rodgers but some of that is being tested by the summer signings, I'm sure they will be more cautious. I do think a reasonable budget would be around £20-30m with the current position we are in.

So in my opinion that leaves us either buying 1 proven goalscorer who has a decent chance of hitting the ground running, or 2 unproven strikers. I think it's easy decision to be honest. We're talking about half a season here as we have Origi coming in the summer. We're also seemingly sticking to a lone striker formation and if that changes I'd be confident in Lambert or Balo as a second striker, rather than someone less proven. And that is without Sturridge playing a part, which he more than likely will.

So with your criteria of what we need, which I agree with; can you think of 2 affordable players who fit it? The names of affordable players coming to mind are the likes of Danny Ings, Eduardo Vargas... I'm struggling to think of any who are an upgrade on Borini that won't individually cost £15m+ in January.

I know I have jumped to another topic here but let me tell you, where I work the vast majority of the employees are female and when you even touch the subject ""maternity leave"" and ""cost to the business"" They turn into a bunch of trothing at the mouth demons from hell. 

The company I work for treats me well, and they are thus very lenient on a few things when it comes to wellbeing of staff. One of the things they do is make sure every woman that takes maternity leave has a maximum of 1 year off and they get paid for the whole year, (at a reduced rate after the first few months) this place has been open for 20 years and almost every single woman that has gone on maternity leave has took the entire year then decided not to come back to work, just to quit. The thing is the couple that own the business dare not try and take the money back for the thought of ruining their reputation (it's a consulting business of sorts) so it must cost them thousands, especially when they need to hire a contractor at short notice either when they decide not to come back and the temp has a new job lined up, or the workload piles on the current staff because some of them are missing. 

If you bring thus up with ANY female member of staff, except the one HR lady, they go into a boiling rage about it's only fair, children are costly, they can't predict the future etc etc, while men don't get the same treatment but that is okay? Even if they did I wouldn't be fucking okay with it. 

Because this has happened quite a few times now, the managers seem to have stopped hiring young women entirely and only hire people in their 35s+. 

I know I will get flamed for this, but it's things like this that lead to pay gaps. You could argue that it's a problem with the companies policy, and yes I agree they are too lax on this it needs to change but my god, this shouldn't be fucking happening in the first place!

Add to this another very important point: when rich children go to school with other rich children their money counts for nothing. Most of the other kids are rich too. They have to learn to establish themselves by other means. They learn to value things which aren't money.

Send a child from a top private school to a comprehensive though and they suddenly stick out because their money really means something.

false,dlige,UnionFlag,London - XJ6-FA ('11),"Really, don't be. The hardest part is dealing with inevitable nerves. My advice:

1. Parking bike and walking it to adjacent space - remember to put in neutral when you turn engine off (makes wheeling it possible!). Put kickstand up before you move it and make sure it's down fully when you have finished moving it. Observation around and looking where you're walking it to are important, the length of time it takes you is not important at all. take as long as you need and remember to keep bike leaned towards you so you have full control.

2. slalom and figure 8 - I think most people are daunted by this because it you go too slow it becomes much, much harder. Practice a bit wherever you can on any bike. As tips i'd say always focus slightly ahead of where you want the bike to go and don't worry about looking at the cones, often focussing on them will make life much harder. Make wide turns around the figure 8 blue cones. wide turns will make your life much much easier and remember to keep your head up and eyes focussing on a point in the direction you want to go, not on the ground. Observation before you pull away, of course!

3. slow riding - Again, eyes up and arms relaxed. Clutch control here is crucial so make sure you're comfortable with where the biting point of your bike is. Again, observation before you pull away (life-saver shoulder checks).

4. u-turn - THE two most important things here are to make sure you get the handlebars of the bike round as much as possible as early as possible once you commence the turn and to not focus on the ground or the opposite kerb. pick a point in the distance you want to be facing towards after you've started the turn and nice, smooth clutch control. remember observation over your shoulder before you pull away!

5. controlled stop - here, although you're not required to make a certain speed as you pass the speed trap, I think you should try to do it at the speed that's required of you for the emergency stop and the swerve maneuver. This way you know how fast it feels and can aim for that for those parts of the test. You examiner won't always volunteer this information after this part, but if you ask they will happily tell you! remember to keep progressive pressure on the front brake and lightly on the rear to avoid skidding (if you have abs on the bike then don't stress!).

6. emergency stop - much the same procedure but you are required to do 50kmph! really focus on stopping as quick as possible. progressive application of both brakes is really important, don't jam them on and don't leave it too late. try not to get the clutch in too early as you brake, leave that until after you've almost come to a stop and if you stall on this part it is not a problem AT ALL. so don't stress. The examiner will raise their hand almost as soon as you are through the speed trap (red/yellow cone pairs) - don't try to second guess them but it helps if you're aware.

7. swerve and avoid - I always found this the most worrying part, but don't as if you understand the concept of counter-steering then it suddenly becomes childsplay, literally so easy! look up counter steering on youtube and practice it on a bike (off the road). In essence you'll find you're able to get the bike to turn wonderfully quickly and responsively if you steer the handlebars in the opposite direction to where you want to turn. The idea is conservation of momentum and the bike will lean over reall quick this way. Don't focus on the cone, pick a point far outside the blue cone you have to avoid and use that as a target.

And that's it! easy easy, I promise!

General tips - don't hesitate to ask anything to the examiner at any point if you need clarification! Ask for your speed through the traps if it's not offered. always always shoulder check before you pull away and keep your arms and shoulders relaxed, it'll really help your control of the bike. If you have any other questions, ask away. Good luck whenever it is!",0,1416413220,null,0,false,0,cm71957,t3_2m3cl7,t1_cm71957,t1_cm6y9p2,null,1425948205,2,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,2

I have never seen anything like this at all.

In the research labs I worked at in Germany the senior postdocs were mostly female and were 'above' the mostly male PhD students - and this was in Applied Physics! Hardly known for having lots of women.

Science is just a bad career, period. It's not the 60's anymore - getting grants is just almost pure luck - my supervisor asked for a £20k grant to get a signal amplifier which would enable him to do higher quality research and was turned down - he is an expert in signal processing and his annual salary is more than that (although probably not by a huge sum - science is also poorly paid)

Women tend to be less likely to remain in academia which is hardly surprising given the gruelling work hours (my professors were often writing grants and papers in the wee hours of the morning) and the unforgiving career track prior to getting the elusive academic position.

Given that women have a biological clock that men do not have - if they want to ensure they have a family then they have to do so relatively young (IVF is not a sure thing) and this is a difficult choice and in fact the lack of a family life due to the itinerant nature of academia is also a major driver behind men leaving academia (Emmanuel Derman cited it as a main reason he left Physics for Wall St.) -  but it hits women younger.

I spent 2 years on a different forum dedicated to the religion/moral debate. I had over 5000 posts, went over and over arguments for all sorts of things. I have a post-graduate in Philosophy and I am self-educated in Thomistic philosophy. Not once did I ever, ever, ever get close to changing someones mind. In fact, I never even got close to someone conceding a single point. All that happened was unbelievably long posts, lots of insults (even from myself unfortunately) and thread closures. 

I am more than happy to talk to someone *in real life* about any issue that I believe strongly about. But someone demanding a debate on their terms is not what I am into. If I can, I avoid arguing moral or religious points online. Especially where I see it is imprudent - and reddit is the most imprudent place to do it; and it's particularly imprudent to ""debate"" with someone who asks for one on the internet. I have debates with people in real life all the time about these and other issues in fact!

As for putting forward my arguments: there are plenty available online for whoever is curious (by the way, this is exactly the type of leading statement that indicates a dishonest start to an online ""debate"" - those in a real debate are already very familiar with their opponents arguments - people who do this are not looking to learn they are looking to set the trap and pounce with whatever they currently have rolling in their head because you just know they have an itchy trigger finger ready with ""omg you soo stupidz xtianz"" or the pro-choice equivalent).

If you insist that I must debate this person; fine, I will, but if I concede that demand they should concede mine which is to come to my flat in person with some hot chocolate and sit down with me and talk. No reddit fan-fair, no downvote brigade, no ego or for teh lulz smugness. Fair no?

For Santander 123 all you need is to go online and open it. It'll be explained really well on their site, but essentially you need to have at least two direct debits set up and you need to pay in a minimum amount each month - I think it's £500. Normally that's easy if you're employed, but in your situation you can move that minimum amount from your pre-existing current account in another bank (don't close it). That's not to say you have to keep that £500 in there.

So, have your online poker profits come into your original account;
move money every month (the minimum or more) into your S123;
get 3% (before tax) on your cash.

To get the top interest rate to also need to have more than £5k in it all the time. They don't pay any interest on money over a 20k limit. That's when you can consider opening a second Santander account.

It's a bit of work for modest small gains but it's a good exercise in money management. Other folks find more clever ways to move their money around.

Bare in mind though that you're taxed on the 3% from source, making ISAs look more competitive. If it's six and two threes go with the ISA. Easier than faffing with Santander money movements and if you end up not spending it you then have the beginnings of tax-free savings stash that you can take advantage of if/when the interests rates improve in future years.

But while you're employed (since poker winnings isn't a taxable income...) read this! [HMRC: Getting tax-free interest on savings or claiming tax back when you're unemployed or low income] (http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/incometax/tax-free-interest.htm)

false,mediaboy,cnty-england,England,"I went to private school on a scholarship and would concur with most of your points to some extent. However, I feel that you neglect to mention one very  important thing: for many people at private school they lack perspective of an outside world. 

Especially true at boarding schools, private schools create a bubble around their students. Inside this bubble are classes, extra curriculars, field trips, skiing trips, international holidays. They tell you when and where you should go, can go. They vet your pubs and push you towards making all kinds of decisions. They create your world around you very carefully, whilst setting it up so that you aren't able to push outside it to make the mistakes and learn the lessons that develop you into a person. 

Having gone to, and worked, at both private and state sector schools I honestly think that state sector people tend to be better at making decisions and adapting to life and having independence. Every private sector student (bar a few, all of whom had very down to earth parents who forced their child to be very independent whilst fighting in their child's corner to protect that by backing off over controlling tutors/teachers) I've met feels very, very young compared to the state school equivalents.

Whilst both look forwards to later life, state schools seem to impress it upon their students that the real world is hard and tell them that rhey need to have independence. Private schools seem to suggest that they are the real world and neglect independence as a character point.

&gt;Mason analysis

You make the point that Mason is a breath of fresh air in comparison to other CM's who don't want to get on the ball and also seemingly pass backwards. However, you don't back this second claim up in the stats you post right after. % of passes forward in comparison to others would better illustrate your point. You could also find and compare passes in the final third to make your point.

You also only reference stats from 1 game, even though you open with ""for the past few weeks"", implying you are referring to multiple games. 

&gt;Lloris analysis

Nitpicking, but City away last season is most certainly a game that Lloris did not impress. He threw the ball into the back of his own net twice in the opening 15 minutes which essentially killed the game off and started the annihilation which snowballed into a shattering of the teams confidence that is still not repaired. Also, ""while I have no doubt that Kaboul was a good choice [as captain]"", most fans would disagree with this statement so you may want to back up your claim.

In total I don't think there is much depth. Many of the things you say are obvious observations and that isn't going to make people come back and read again. You need a bit more insight.

&gt;You mean the people who expressed their opinion in a different facebook group? The students union who expressed an opinion? The women's group who expressed an opinion? Or the Christ Church Junior Common Room who had a debate and (after voting on the subject) expressed an opinion?

Well the facebook group promised to; 

&gt;“take along some non-destructive but oh so disruptive instruments to help demonstrate to the anti-choicers just what we think of their 'debate'.” 

Which is less expressing an opinion and more threatening to disrupt the debate.

The students union and the womans group said that; 

&gt;""It is absurd to think we should be listening to two cisgender men debate about what people with uteruses should be doing with their bodies.""

Which while an opinion is a stupid one on two levels. 

1. It implies that people who are not directly affected by an issue shouldn't talk about it.

2. The debate was not about the right to choose but about the effect that the right to have an abortion has had on British culture.

And finally the Christ Church Junior Common room who had a debate on the subject and decided against allowing them to have their debate. While they have every right to their opinion the fact of the matter remains that this type of censorship is never a good thing. Plus the fact that they put their complaint to the college the day before the event, giving the college little to no time to sift through the issues smacks of  a sneaky tactic that people with faith in their values shouldn't have to use.

If we want to maintain the universal service obligation, it should be directly subsidised by central government. It isn't special treatment for Royal Mail, since no other carrier has this obligation. But they'd still have a monopoly, and the government would get shafted on the price.

Parcel carrying, by comparison, is a highly profitable, competitive market that needs Royal Mail as much as a fish needs rollerblades.

The available solutions are:

1. Abolish the universal service obligation. Socially undesirable, as well as being political suicide.

2. Pay Royal Mail a sum that stops them moaning. Hugely expensive, since they're a monopoly.

3. Put the entire postal system out to competitive tender as a monopoly. Probably even more expensive than just paying Royal Mail to shut up.

4. Put the postal system out to competitive tender piecemeal. Probably cheapest, but complicated and requires civil servants to work for their knighthood.

5. Just nationalise the postal system and have done with it. Politically desirable, not much more expensive than Option 4, but requires spending money the government doesn't have.

However, I connect my phone to the stereo and occasionally answer/make calls but rarely send texts. I'll only type a short text when stopped at lights, not while moving and if someone rings I can tap one button to answer it and talk hands free.

My usual excuse is if I'm driving somewhere, get lost and need directions or if I'm running late - very short quick calls. I guess my reason is because I'm a selfish twat and think I'm a better driver than most people.

I do feel that I pick my moments to use the phone though and I won't prioritise the phone over driving (e.g. lights turn green.. I drop the phone, not finish my text first) and I make sure I'm aware of what's around me before moving.

false,Kesuke,null,null,"**A serious answer...**

It's probably down to several things that together, have combined to make a lackluster election campaign;

* Consider things from Ed's angle... despite 3 consecutive Labour terms, Cameron's own ineffective 2010 election campaign meant he still didn't win enough seats to form a majority. It's almost unheard of for an incumbent government to gain seats at a 2nd term election - so until recently all Miliband had to do was ""sit it out"" and he was practically the de facto next prime minister. As it turns out, that's not quite whats happened for the reasons below.

* There is a considerable sense of voter apathy towards Ed Miliband as an individual. He hasn't been helped by repeated accusations of character weakness. It started before he even won the leadership contest against his brother - which itself was pretty damaging. Essentially voters don't like Cameron's policies, but they don't like Ed Miliband as a leader.

* The bottom line is, despite the current point swing to the Tories, Labour still look like they are more likely to form the next government - and that is why Ed Miliband is clinging on for dear life. The real danger to **both** the Tories and Labour is that British politics has become very fragmented for two main reasons; 1) Devolution has created new parties in Scotland, Wales and NI that have expanded and 2) the rise of a right-wing protest vote in the form of UKIP... which although unlikely to win large numbers of seats still has the potential to cleave both the Tory and Labour vote in England, particularly in certain areas like the South Coast. Whatever the election map looks like next year, it's going to be a lot more colourful. 

---------

Personally I think Labour have had a failure in their own strategy, and have focused too much on trying to fight a backfoot name-calling campaign against the Tories... whilst ignoring the real gem in their crown... *""The Cost of Living Crisis""* This is really the only part of their campaign rhetoric where the voters really agree with them en mass. They should be expanding this into a more ambitious program, for example including things like radical overhaul of the rental sector including compulsory landlord registration and mandatory spot safety checks.

Future votes aren't going to be fought between the old divisions of labour voting working classes and conservative voting middle-managers/southerners... instead elections are going to be fought between the widening generational gap. At some stage there is going to be a 'tipping point' moment where policies that favour the over 40s (like the triple lock) are ousted in favour of those that support younger working age adults that can't get onto the housing ladder, are stuck in a rental trap with high levels of debt, low disposable income but make up the bulk of the working population. Labour are naturally well positioned to take advantage of those demographic changes - since the Tories natural position is to support the old and wealthy rather than the young. Labour are more agile to adopt those sorts of changes and that is where they should be expanding... it might actually cost them the 2015 election, but the difference is they'd win 2020 with a 1997-style landslide and probably hold it for several terms.

The issue I have is that most people would use that sizeable income (mere 'chicken-feed' according to Boris Johnson) to invest in other ventures, the process of tax avoidance is then repeated ad infinitum. 

In my opinion the tax system needs overhauling so that the more a company/individual makes the more they are taxed. Three tiers is a ridiculous idea when you consider how many different class dynamics there are in place. 

We also need to deconstruct the systems in place that affords Westminster the power to write of tax. For example, Vodafone. Last year they were due to pay eight billion in taxes, after rubbing shoulder with our esteemed politicians the payment was reduced to two billion. The next week Osborn cut welfare by seven billion.

Essentially the British people were robbed of six billion that day. Let's just imagine Vodafone were made to pay that tax, how much for instance, was made up of income tax that was stolen from the salaries of their workers, how much, was made up of sales tax that the end user paid? Not to mention overcharges and the incredibly efficient methods these companies employ in ripping people off on a daily basis.

Really though, the tax on your earning of 500k (of which will be well over 50% taking into account sales tax and other nefarious robbery, more into the 80% mark I would imagine) is pretty fucked up. However, if you're going to be making in excess of 500k every year, then using that wealth for opportunities that aren't afforded to normal people, then avoid paying taxes on those profits, then yes, you should pay into the purse.

They raised awareness and action over domestic violence and rape, creating support groups and shelters. There are charities out there in uk which specially help men out too  (and it's still improving since its not perfect yet) and some shelters which allow male victims to join.

You could argue getting women into workforce and improving pay has taken pressure off men not to be the only one funding the family. now job losses for couples is not as dangerous as it was before. 

 Improving women's sexual image making it less taboo for women (and men) to talk about enjoying sex and making casual sex, porn, prostitution less shameful (though admittley fem groups might argue over these issues). There is less of issue to have male heirs and father paying dowries. also despite dating scene still sucking women can date more casually/openly and it's more accepted (even if not always in practise) for women to approach men. Abortion laws and women owning their bodies has likely stopped lot of forced marriages/payments for men when accidents happen. 

Gender discrimination at work is common for fem groups to rally for, [it is available to men too.](http://www.unison.org.uk/get-help/help-with-problems-at-work/discrimination/gender/your-rights/). there are still stories about men failing to be heard, but I'd argue this down to women still being seen as weak gender, which feminists argue against as gender image. 

In some countries after maternity laws have been in place for women, people are now fighting for the same for men. You could see this as a step by step forward for true equality on the issue starting with women and now for men.

To quote from the Kickstarter page:

&gt;We’ve reached the limit of what we can do part-time. The next three years are going to be hard, full-time work to set the project up. We need to confirm and agree the lunar science and develop the instrument package. We need to plan and research the online public archive. We need to get commercial partners on board to design and develop the lunar landing module and the drilling mechanism. We need to pilot the education programme. We need to prepare the sales and marketing campaign for our memory boxes. And we need to do all of this globally.

&gt;We know that this project can work. We know that our funding model based on future sales of our digital memory boxes will work. But we need money to get to the next stage. We are asking the Kickstarter community to help us bring this exciting and innovative project to life.

Mine are a lot higher now, but for many people they dropped drastically. I also wouldn't equate consumption of material goods with living standards. There's a lot more to life than buying stuff, and once you move from absolute poverty to relative comfort the pleasure you gain from more better stuff drops of drastically. If we don't care about the environment, then that's not much of a problem, but at some point a trade off between consumption and sustainability appears.

Capitalism does indeed rely on exponential growth. If growth stops, then it's considered a crisis. It has nothing to do with population, though. It's easier to sustain growth with a growing population, a shrinking one creates problems, but the system still demands its 2-3% per year. But that's not relevant because even with a stable population it's doubtful that we could bring everyone up to rich-world levels of consumption.

Since the war governments have tried to bypass issues of equality and distribuition by promising that everybody will get richer through economic growth (the socialist countries were even more obsessed with growth than the capitalist ones, incidentally).

I've been reading up on it, along with some other accounts, here: http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/banking/compare-best-bank-accounts

What's the difference between simply opening a Santander 123 account and switching to it properly? How easy is the switching process? If I don't switch to it properly when I open it, would I be able to do so at a later date?

Also, regarding the two direct debits - I don't currently don't pay any direct debits. Is there an easy way to cheaply satisfy this requirement? And for the £500 monthly payment - could I pay this into the 123 account from my current HSBC account, and then pay it back into my HSBC account a day later and repeat each month?

Every ISA that I've looked at seems pretty abyssmal - the best easy-access at the moment are 1.55%, and even the best 4 year fixed ISA is only 2.4%. If the Santander 123 is a solid choice as a main bank account for me in the long term, it seems like a no brainer - especially if I can sort out tax-free interest before I start working. Is the tax-free stuff quite easy to set up by the way? Form seems simple enough from a quick glance - is there anything else I need to consider before applying for tax-free interest?

Thanks for your help again. It's all quite complicated but I think I'm starting to make sense out of it.

I'd need to ask questions to give specific advice, so failing the ability to do that I'll just talk about me. My skin gets driest and flakiest in the areas immediately surrounding the blemishes, so most concealers marketed for covering blemishes actually draw more attention to the area I feel. Which makes my favourite product for covering blemishes Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer in the lightest shade, Chantilly/Light 1. If flaking around the blemish isn't an issue and/or oiliness is, Bobbi Brown Face Touch Up Stick. For covering redness, I use Stila One Step Correct, which I adore and never let myself run out of. If I'm using it as a primer I'll add a teeny bit of Face Atelier Ultra Foundation in Zero Minus, which is pure white foundation. I wouldn't recommend foundation, if you genuinely need more coverage then add tinted moisturiser, Laura Mercier is what I think gets the best reviews but I haven’t tried it. I'll also add that skincare is the real issue here, and if you can at all afford it it would surely be worth seeing a dermatologist or even a facialist for some products. If you're using make-up it becomes even more important to properly cleanse and hydrate your skin, or else you'll just be adding to your problems.

That said, I would not be so quick to assume that 'ffp is not a problem'.  If there were not at least questions to be asked and answered, UEFA wouldn't be piling through the club's accounts in the first place.  Many of the assumptions above are true of this particular FY, but UEFA cares about three years, not just the current one.  Things like shirt sales, for example, simply don't exist.  Warrior pays us a flat rate every year and, outside of shirts sold by the Club's official store for which we get the merchant's cut, we don't see any income from them.  The saving grace for us will be that we may be able to deduct a large chunk of our wage bill for 2011/2012 if we can show positive steps to profitability, but how much that large chunk is is debatable.  Another factor might well be that the Club owes UKSV a fair bit of coin and FFP will probably force the conversion of that debt into equity and it wouldn't surprise me to see the owners want some of that money back via debt repayment prior to conversion, although that's entirely speculative on my part based on FSG's seeming reluctance to do a debt to equity conversion historically.",0,1416421116,null,0,false,0,cm75p04,t3_2ms810,t1_cm75p04,t1_cm74i2o,null,1425946133,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

&gt;

&gt;___Payne___ is an American [television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television) series, patterned after the British program *[Fawlty Towers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fawlty_Towers)*. It starred American [actor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor) [John Larroquette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Larroquette), who portrayed assistant district attorney [Dan Fielding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Fielding) on the American television program *[Night Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Court)*. Larroquette was also an executive producer for the series.

&gt;*Payne* was a mid-season replacement on [CBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS) and aired in March and April 1999. The show also starred [JoBeth Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoBeth_Williams), [Julie Benz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Benz) and [Rick Batalla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Batalla). Despite fairly positive reception, and receiving the blessing of [John Cleese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cleese), who agreed to take a recurring role if the show was renewed [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*], *Payne* was quickly cancelled. Nine episodes were filmed; eight were aired. The show is not available on DVD.

The Metro is for the 'urban youth' which tend to be a lot more left leaning, so the Metro is way more left than the Daily Mail.

The Guardian is for left leaning people too. So there's probably quite a big overlap between their market and the metro's. I'm not sure.

Beef Cheek Pie

**What You Need**

A couple of beef cheeks

Some beef stock (by stock I mean use a decent stock cube and one of those little stock pot things)

One carton of pasatta

Mushrooms (Chestnuts or field not button)

2 large or 3 medium onions

HP Sauce

Tomato ketchup

Worcester Sauce

Chipotle paste (I get mine from asda, its about £1.50 a jar and lasts for ages, you can use it in stocks, marinades, rubs, sauces, stews and much else)

Garlic

Paprika

Salt

Pepper

Mixed Herbs

Ready made pastry

Egg

**What You Do**
Slice the onions, chop the garlic

Heat up a little oil in the slow cooker and seal the beef cheeks, just give them a minute on each side until they are slightly coloured, take them out and leave them to one side 

In the same pan get the onions and throw them in along with the herbs, the chopped garlic and start to soften it. Add about half a teaspoon of chipotle paste, lots of mixed herbs, paprika, mix it all up andcontinue to cook

Add the whole mushrooms and stir in to mix all the flavours, lower the heat, add about a quarter of a bottle of worcester sauce, a good squirt of HP and ketchup and return the cheeks to the pan

Add the pasatta and the stock and make sure everything is covered in liquid, stir well, set slow cooker to very lowest setting for about 5-6 hours and leave it alone

After this time put it on the cooker top and reduce the sauce by about half, at this point check for seasoning then using a potato masher or forks break the cheeks apart

Transfer the mix into a ovenproof dish and roll out the pastry to fit, tuck the pastry into the sides and eggwash it, cut a couple of steam vents in to prevent it bursting and bake it in a medium oven until the pastry is golden brown

Serve with mash

false,HugoRune1965,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;&gt; I am yet to be convinced that a society called the ""Oxford Students for Life"" are completely unbiased on this subject.

&gt; What's that got to do with anything?

The author of the article appears to think that free speech mans that he should not only be able to express himself, but also control the response of people who disagree with him.

&gt; “take along some non-destructive but oh so disruptive instruments to help demonstrate to the anti-choicers just what we think of their 'debate'.”

&gt; Which is less expressing an opinion and more threatening to disrupt the debate.

In other words, the author thinks that students should not be allowed to protest against something that they disagree with.

&gt;&gt; ""It is absurd to think we should be listening to two cisgender men debate about what people with uteruses should be doing with their bodies.""

&gt; Which while an opinion is a stupid one on two levels...

It doesn't matter whether you think the opinion is ""stupid"" or not, they were expressing an opinion. Isn't that what free speech is supposed to be about?

&gt; And finally the Christ Church Junior Common room who had a debate on the subject and decided against allowing them to have their debate.  While they have every right to their opinion the fact of the matter remains that this type of censorship is never a good thing.

It's not censorship. Nobody was denied the right to express their opinion, they were just not allowed to express it in one particular location.

false,the_honey_monster,null,null,"Labour seem very keen on helping people in my situation (probably a long term renter if it weren't for shares I've bought). I want to see a fairer renting situation like the rest of Europe. I think we could probably go one further and adopt the guarantee model used on the continent which see's the bank 'loan' you the money but its sits in a trust rather than actually going to the landlord. You don't physically have to have the cash on hand which makes it easier for people wanting to get started with renting. 

As for Europe, I'm biased as I lived in Belgium for 6 months and love lots of aspect of the EU. I do think we need to have a serious discussion in the UK with the way we interact with Europe as a whole. I think its deplorable to send idiots over to Europe as our MEPs (looking at your UKIP) who make us brits look childish and don't engage in the politics and then moan that the EU doesn't care much for us. 

Just watch this to get an ideal of how puerile their behaviour is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkQFYPmOPA4

If we sent people into the European parliament who got involved in the discussions and wanted to change it rather than  protesting it, we might actually get somewhere. 

The biggest issue with Europe in the UK seems to be immigration and its a really difficult problem to solve. Its often painted that its only the UK that is facing issues with immigration but it isn't. A lot of 1st world European countries are facing immigration issues. The problem I believe is we expanded the EU to quickly to nations that we're not of the caliber to be a part of the free market. Its happened now so I think we need to find a solution. My personal view is we should be pumping as much money into the EU as possible in order to help disadvantaged areas to bring the living standards up. I live in Cardiff Bay which is beautiful and a perfect example of EU money being spent really well in run down areas. Lots of Cornwall also gets funding from the EU because its seen as a needing investment (Eden project as another example). 

On the whole, being apart of the EU affords us Brits an awful lot of benefits. We can work anywhere in the EU without worrying about Visa. We get access to goods produced in Europe without them having any import fees. We can choose to have surgery and treatment in any EU hospital to skip waiting lists in the UK and the NHS will reimburse us the cost. Our farms are subsided in order to be able to compete in such a large market (if we left most UK farms wouldn't be able to compete). We have people looking after consumers interest (our government doesn't appear to care much for this at the moment). 

There are so many little things that we the EU has changed that I couldn't begin to list them all. Its not perfect but the idea of the EU is fantastic in my opinion. We should all be working closely together as we're stronger as one united entity than we are separate. I would hate to see us remove ourselves from the EU. Just like lots thoughts the Scots would be crazy to leave the UK, many think we Brits are crazy for considering leaving the EU

false,dpash,cnty-expat,Expat (Belize),"There is already retirement visa programmes here. They're required to have US$2000 a month income per person. Property will not skyrocket, as there's so little here. There's the population of Brighton &amp; Hove in a country the size of Wales. Most expats want to live by the beach, so there's some pressure on prices there, but there's so much more land that most Belizeans do not see property prices increasing. 

Increasing population and taxation of that increased population will help. The low population currently also makes it financially uneconomical for more than one or two companies in a particular market place. There are lots of instances of monopolies, like Belize Telemedia being the only telecoms company. There's just not the market for someone to invest in creating a rival network for telephones and internet. There are a few bit players in a few regions, but it's mostly BTL. As a result, my internet costs me US$200 a month for 8mbit/s. There's only one brewery in the country. They create Belikin and Lighthouse beer. They make it seem like they're two breweries, but they're the same company. They even brew Guinness under license.

I have not, but then I live in the north of Belize City, which is generally safer. Most of the crime happens in the south of the city, which is a result of a deliberate policy of moving all the gang members to that part of the country. I'm also near the main tourist part of the city, which has increased security. My friend did have US$75 stolen out of her bag yesterday though.

You avoid walking around most of the city at night. I only walk around the area directly outside my apartment. 

This isn't a war zone. As long as you stay out of the gang areas and don't flash any wealth around, you'll be fairly safe.

The main things I'd suggest is reducing import duties on products not produced in Belize, making the cost of living lower for the majority of the people here, increase immigration to increase the tax base, increase taxation on the upper class, reduce nepotism and low level corruption in government, decriminalise drugs and treat them as a health issue to reduce the effect they have on society.

He's got a decent long range shot on him, but his accuracy isn't great unless it's a free kick.  He's not particularly creative and isn't likely to get many assists for others.  He doesn't seem to be able to run in behind defenses successfully.  He's not the type to take a man on with the ball at his feet.  His work rate defensively for us hasn't been half bad really, but isn't exactly great either.  

What sort of system would he excel in?

We need him to be able to make runs behind, to be able to beat his man with the ball, to be able to create and have the vision to bring others into the play and other things you would expect a top striker to do but for me those things are simply not things that he does particularly well nor really has ever done well (well, at least at City, didn't watch him much at Milan so no idea what he did there outside of looking at the stats at seeing 140+ shots with only 7 goals).",0,1416423922,null,0,false,0,cm77c2y,t3_2mrk0z,t1_cm77c2y,t1_cm765op,null,1425945368,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

The problem is with many conditions there is potential irritation from the active ingredient, potential irritation from other ingredients (alcohol, SLS) and then the inflammation./ irritation when the condition itself is uncontrolled.

So although SLS and alcohol may be irritating for some, the active in that formulation may be the same or slightly less irritating AND the condition is quickly and easily controlled so there is a reduction in overall inflammation/ irritation. It's balancing side effects with efficacy.

Where that falls down a little is for those who are trying to maintain relatively clear skin, so don't have current irritation/ inflammation from the condition itself. If one prescribed medication doesn't work you will often just be put on a different medication, not a different formulation.

false,Chrisischan,flair8,,"Completely different, as Ronaldo is capable of creating and executing his own goals, and especially in a counterattacking system. Chadli does not create his own goals, and we play in a high line system that atm is too congested for anyone to do anything consistent.

As far as the marking problem, Chadli has the pace to easily outmaneuver two CB's. In fact, that excess in pace and work in those positions is exactly the kind of thing we need to induce more chaos in opposing back lines. As is, opposing CB's are going nowhere and we consequently have no channels to work through and into. FB's can hang with Chadli, but these CB's cannot. Another thing to take account of is the rotation. We haven't seen much of it, but that's largely because it doesn't matter with how compacted teams play against us. With the rotation, that makes it far more difficult for set markers to follow finishers such as Chadli. 

We desperately need more pace in the wide positions. We've reached a point such that we need a big change if we're to better open up how teams play against us in such compact manners. This prying open will create more chances for everyone in this system. So we cannot continue with the status quo. The most versatile player we have in these positions just so happens to be our most consistent, and it also just so happens that he isn't scoring goals as wingers would. So, we introduce what we desperately need, and we keep our most consistent player doing what he's already doing. Some marking from slower CB's is hardly a justifiable reason to make a change we so massively need.

Honestly I knew some lot of the makes on the site. Whether they be Romeo Y Julieta, Monte Christo, Cohiba etc. So I went by countries, e.g Mexico, Nicaragua, Honduras etc. Then choose the ones I like the description of.

The little ones I will almost definately smoke first, nice 'break puff' as I say due to their shorter longevity. I'll save the Robusta and Corona for a lazy day, where I can sit and relax. 

I have in fact already smoked the Griffins Classic. I was deeply impressed with it. A rich dark wood scent with mellow nutty after taste. A good solid 7.5/10 for me personally.

www.cigarworld.de is very well priced or brilliantly considering I'm from London. The shipping some say is a bit pricey but the discount on the cigars alone is enough to warrant a purchase. I got this bundle from Germany in 2 days. Always word of advice if you use the website type www.cigarworld.de/en/ so you have it translated into English for you.

Hope this answers everything.

false,Frogs_are_Friends,null,null,"&gt; Is it fair to say that this would be a good option for me as a main bank account in the long term?

Yes, it does well in customer surveys. I've used it and like it as well. Few downsides

&gt; What's the difference between simply opening a Santander 123 account and switching to it properly?

In your situation you don't have an employer to put money in every month. So you'll have to pay in money yourself from another bank.

&gt;How easy is the switching process?

Don't use their service. All their service does is help you switch your DDs over, of which you have none.

&gt; If I don't switch to it properly when I open it, would I be able to do so at a later date?

Yes, but it's invisible. There's nothing magical about a current account. You're 'supposed' to only have one. Many people have more than one. I had three at one point.

&gt; Also, regarding the two direct debits - I don't currently don't pay any direct debits. Is there an easy way to cheaply satisfy this requirement?

Yeah, off the opt of my head an easy one is to open a Post Office savers account. It (and others) allow you to regularly send money to the account by DD. Stick a fiver in every month. You'll find other easy DDs to satisfy Santander on moneysavingexpert. Maybe you can find an ISA product that allows you to regularly make desposits by DD??

&gt; And for the £500 monthly payment - could I pay this into the 123 account from my current HSBC account, and then pay it back into my HSBC account a day later and repeat each month?

Yeah, pay it into 123 every month. Paying it back out to the same account is a bit obvious. Maybe other people have done this successfully but you're playing with fire. Why not use the 123 account for your spending?

&gt; Is the tax-free stuff quite easy to set up by the way? Form seems simple enough from a quick glance - is there anything else I need to consider before applying for tax-free interest?

The HMRC tax website is pretty good. Should be self explanatory. Again: this all takes time. You could see is as not being worth it or see it as a good learning opportunity. I'm in a different position to you so don't have personal experience of going through it.

&gt; Thanks for your help again. It's all quite complicated but I think I'm starting to make sense out of it. I know you suggested going towards an ISA, but would you agree that if the 123 account is a sensible option for me as a bank account long term, that this is the better route to go down?

No bother.

It's personal preference. The S123 account has been and (as far as I know) still is a great current account. And ISAs are the way to go when you're earning and to protect your compund interest from tax. A lot of people end up with both.

Simple life: get an ISA. The end.
Clever, convoluted and time-expensive (but interesting?): get S123, use the HMRC link.

You'll end up with an ISA sooner or later. You'll end up with a good current account sooner or later.",0,1416426239,null,0,false,0,cm78o91,t3_2mrvig,t1_cm78o91,t1_cm752k3,null,1425944615,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

Why is this an issue though? Parties can change drastically in a short period of time. 

&gt;And again, with no party whip, how does party policy change anything? There is no punishment for voting against party policy, so you are essentially voting for individual MPs, not party policy.

Well, it shows what the party as a whole, represent. Many Tory MP's disagree with Cameron and the current Tory party, and can vote against things, like the EU arrest warrant. Maybe, the part will chose a party whip, maybe not, the point is each MP is an individual with a different point of view, but have generally similar ideas and believe in party policy.

It's not black and white and direct confrontation to their own governments seem rare. The views of many Monarchs have been widely known, even if they didn't state them in public - and in those days that certainly counted as being very influential.

It remains the single thing which prevents me campaigning, but /u/buried_treasure has started me thinking, because when Lizzie goes, that looks very likely to come to an end.

My original thread in the UK SCA sub is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/comments/2m3wmz/any_help_for_a_skincare_newbie_with_redness/). Not sure if that helps out with any of the questions you had, hopefully it does! Currently seeing a derm, but they seem to know less than some of the people in the SCA sub which is pretty worrying... Is there such a thing as a facialist?! I might look into that!

I think it's mostly the redness that plagues me, especially on the corners / sides of my nose. And I'm just starting on a skincare routine, so hopefully that has some benefit but I'm not sure beneficial it will be on rosacea / eczema / seb derm if it's actually one of those (still undiagnosed).

Hugely appreciate the suggestions and will have a look into them. Are any of them mineral based products?

Balotelli, to me, is like a player on PES6 whose stats are decent, well rounded and he SHOULD be a good player but it's never working for him on the pitch. I ended up selling them for great profit.

However, there is some factual evidences of Balotelli performing well in the past. He's gone off the rail in the last years. It was almost full time circus with him when he was younger - quite a problem child. Didn't look like trying hard enough and at time didn't look like he cared. 

I haven't seen that in Liverpool shirt. Couple of things have annoyed me about his attitude, but these are minor things that he can root out in time (staying on ground too long when he didn't get a foul for example). Can't fault his attitude too much, I think. 

I don't think this slump in form is permanent and he can get going again. Players usually don't magically start playing great after underperforming during a large time period. What he needed was Sturridge to be the main man for a start. Now all the expectations fell on him and it's easy for him to get frustrated when he has not performed for quite a while. He shouldn't be a scapegoat already. I'd give him more time.

Sadly, I don't think Borini is good enough for this level of football. He lacks techical abilities, his first touch is erratic and isn't in control of the ball. What he has is great shooting technique, bit of pace and movement. But he needs more to cut it. So, that's why I think we wanted to sell him and that's why we probably sell him first.

I think a win against crystal palace, ludo, and stoke in 6 days would launch our guys into some better form. There is no quick fix to our problems right now. in addition, i don't think it's a consequence of poor buys or bad coaching, but rather bad circumstances. i mean you take 50 goals out of the team, plus an additional 20 assists and that's 70% of our production last year. we have a lot of new players in the line up who are starting frequently (balo, moreno, lovren) and others who are starting at least every couple of games (marko, manquillo, can)...it's a tough fix to make everyone gel. in addition, a couple stretch of bad games continues to build. now it is rodgers job to lift the squad psychologically and up to the players to give it 110% for the rest of the season. this season is extremely salvagable...i mean extremely. we can get out of the group stages STILL (playing two VERY winnable games, ludogorets away is gonna be the tougher match imo, but basel at home we should expect to win). 

i just think without studdga we are missing that swagger right now. we need stevie g to lift the squad by the scruff of the neck and drag them one last time. if there is one thing that man will leave behind in his career, if nothing else (which there is), it is his ability to inspire, command respect and drag liverpool out of the mud when stand them up when they are down. this team needs hope, this team needs inspiration and they need a true leader to emerge from the flames and pull them out of harms way. it's intriguing to see all of the rodgers out peoples on social media, but real fans will stick by the squad, albeit very frustrated (as they should be). I truly just have to believe that form can turn around very quickly, because our squad has more than enough talent to dispose of almost every team in the league right now bar chelsea and maybe city. our squad beat southhampton (#2), they beat tottenham (handily at that), we've lost to chelsea and city...but im not upset. our form turns around now, our season can turn into a great one. this is the perfect storyline for an epic turnaround. i didn't believe in magic until i saw istanbul and i still believe in magic to this day. this city, this club, this team has given me more hope and joy over the last 23 years than i ever could imagine and i won't give up now because we're having a rough patch of form. I have never been to anfield, and it is a lifelong dream of mine, but knowing that the LFC family is so large and so strong I never feel like I am walking alone...our team shouldn't either.

MPs do *not* care about their constituency. They will always *vote* the way their party tells them to vote.

So if just under half your constituency wanted a different party then they are not represented by your MP.

One of the problems that AV is supposed to fix is to give people the chance to vote for a minority party knowing their vote can ""fall back"" to a main party in the event a majority don't follow suit. But this is ultimately a con - because while this might draw out slightly more votes for that minority party - it will rarely become an absolute majority - leaving the dominant two parties still with all the seats in parliament.

If 10% of the population across the country wanted to vote in the Greens or UKIP shouldn't they have the right to have 10% of MPs representing them? Rather than none at all? But this is what *proportional representation* would give.

All I've ridden prior to this is 4 Honda CG125's, an ER-5 (under the supervision of my instructor so I couldn't hoon it) and a 21 year old Yamaha XV535 with a faulty engine. Compared to those bikes, it's got great acceleration, it's fast, it's nimble, it's incredibly fun and I love it. But compared to bigger better bikes, it's probably slow, unwieldy and boring. Everything is relative. Is it a good bike as a first step up from a 125? Fuck yeah! Are there better bikes out there? Fuck yeah! But I love it, it's my bike, and that's all that matters until I can afford to own more than one bike.

TL;DR The GS500 is rather cheap, it's got enough power for easy motorway riding and enough acceleration to get away from that wanker tailgating you in a BMW M3. It's fuel efficient and it's very easy to enjoy yourself on it, but I'm pretty sure that you could say exactly the same about the CB500 or the ER-5.

Today I was playing the tactical ball kicking game ('football : not soccer' : ref log 375869) for my assigned faction Serbia. I was assigned this faction via a test, a test which I had failed. My scores were off the chart even though I tried my best to hide my abilities. The assigner said it was unlike anything she had ever seen. I blamed it on ""getting too much poontang"", a code I had picked up from human-Mikel-Obi. Never quite was able to comprehend what it meant but it was used as means to get out of tricky situations. It worked.

I understood the basic concept of waffles. They were supposed to provide me with rich energy and necessary carbohydrates in the guise of an appreciable flavor profile. Still according to the assigner, I did not respect them enough.

Cheese on the other hand made no sense to me. It would quite clearly clog up and not provide anything useful to my newly installed energy reactor also known as the ""digestive system"" (ref log 23213 : converts mushy things into harder mushy things for energy). It was quite clearly a waste product. Why humans willingly wasted an already nutritious and energy rich substance? Thats for another day to evaluate.

Hamburgers had overcooked protein. Ineffective compared to properly cooked protein which resulted in the under utilization of energy. All the pastas and pizzas tasted the same to my then obsolete taste profiling system. 

Worst of all were the biscuits. On their own they provided an easily storable and relatively energy efficient source of energy for their size, no wonder humans took them into battle. Combined with tea though it was a different story. No matter what firmware update I installed, no matter how advance my motion and gesture system got..in the end the biscuit always fall into the cup of tea. It has been my only failure to date, perhaps will be my only failure till my memory is wiped and my hardware reassigned. 

All of these elements resulted me getting barred from the Belgian, French, American, Italian and English factions. I then chose Serbia.

They were an odd faction to me and yet so much like me. Much lower probability of illogical behavior, living in cooler climates necessary for my system's cooling, less swayed by human emotions and much more finely tuned and robust compared to normal humans. Which brings me to the events of Nov.19 2014.

I was facing the Greek faction, one of the oldest in human history and a part time learning subject of mine due to my introduction to the human species. They were the ones I suspected were visited by my creators in the first place. My search for meaning was bound to take me further into this faction.


I collided on purpose with a human as part of my scheme of blending in. This one was different though. Unlike the rest of the humans who just roll around or avoid eye contact, this one starred right into my optical imaging system and loaded his hand canon in my direction. I was confused, my logical interface tried to make sense of the situation as there was no statistical possibility or outcome where he would win and yet he wanted to initiate me into battle. The behavior was insubordinate and churlish at best.


I felt my armor equip. It crawled under my skin up my back and then up my chest. I did not like this feeling for I wanted to be better than this. My thermal vision and collateral calculator booted up trying to make the collateral damage of this battle negligible on the rest of the human species watching the tactical ball kicking game.  I felt my x-ray vision point out the vital organs and in that split second the command was ready to be executed. I was going to fire the cloak smoke, boot up my auxiliary missiles for any of his fellow faction-ares who wanted to join in. Under the cloak of the smoke it would be painless, quick and precise. One cut to the jugular artery then spinning to avoid his hand cannon before driving the assassination blade straight to his heart. As the smoke settled it would look like he had exploded. Another mystery for the humans to solve like whats inside a black hole, sometimes their lack of understanding is almost ""endearing"" to me. He wouldn't feel much pain and its the least I owed to him after his audacity to have the honor to face me into battle with everything going against him and his fleshy puny human form.


Then I heard my nuclear arc reactor powering down and felt my armory retract. For the human species known as the ""referee"" (ref log 21431: Human incapable of making a single correct decision given the responsibility to make all the decisions during the ball game) had intervened. Perhaps it was not even necessary for the human had already gazed into my optical imaging system and seen 1/1millionth of what was about to happen and had already retracted his hand canon. For that split second moment when the referee intervened, me and the Greek human had a connection. Was he trustworthy? Did he know more than the rest? Could he be my answer to uncovering the secrets of the origins of the Greek faction and the human race? perhaps too quick to come to a conclusion but maybe its a start.

Day 230254 : My secret's still safe. I may be getting close to the origin of humans and therefore my creators and the reason for my existence.
