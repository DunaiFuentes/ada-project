And wait, either way? So you're disgusted that people who harass others in a sexual manner and in order to racially discriminate against them is not allowed?

Here's a truth bomb. 

It's called escalation. 

If you get up into someones face and yell how you're going to murder them what do you think the end result of that is? Is it a peaceful ending or a violent one? 

If you speak to a child in an inappropriate manner what do you think the end result of that is? Is it you walking away or is it something we don't want to talk about?

If you lie in court what do you think the end result of that is? Is it a correct prosecution or an incorrect one?

The Law isn't in place to discriminate against people. It's in place to protect those you attack with your words. This is all true whether you do it over the internet, via text or otherwise.

Now factor in the recent changes to the IPTV market (youview etc) and this new company, we could (potentially) see in the future further colloborations with these three, meaning they leverage the Footprint (and the gigabit network), the TV content (Sky tv Network) and the NGN netowrk (this includes the Content Delivery Network with TalkTalk) and we are looking at a genuine cost effective network where you can obtain all your BB/IPTV/Telephony network (here is the kicker) with No line rental costs to BT.

So by a game changer we are looking at a network that can be opened up to any reseller to use without having to get involved with the Openreach engineers etc.

I really think that means it's a golden opportunity for players like Holtby to prove to a new manager that they are a crucial element to whatever new scheme we play.

Unfortunately, this hasn't happened. It's not just his assist total, but his chance creation has also been very poor. When I watch him play, I just not see the confidence or fluidity of a #10. It doesn't help that his head is always down either.

I this point, I don't think the can be a true playmaker. He is a cross between a #10 and a box to box midfielder. Good at either, but doesn't really excel. 

Taking over the Lampard role might be the best bet. Sitting further back in a 3 man midfield and making the runs. He has the shot, he just needs to work on his finishing.

For example, if you put £1000 down on a share, you need to pay £11.95 for the privilege (you'll also pay stamp duty). If you want your cash back, the share needs to have risen by at least 2.39% to cover the cost of buying and selling the asset. For smaller investments, this number gets bigger.

Regular investments can make this less of an issue (£1.50 buy in vs £11.95) but you'll still pay the full fee if you want to get your money back out. This is something to consider since it restricts your ability to diversify with different shares. You can use ETFs to do this as an alternative, though.

If you see it happening regularly in your local area by anyone, I suggest you inform the police about it yourself, many of the girls will be vulnerable and unable to help themselves, and you might be saving them from a lifetime of trauma. 

The problem with this case is that the police admitted that people could have been arrested earlier, and people could have been saved if the force had not been so sensitive to criticisms by the Muslim community in the area. This is a well known problem, isolationism of Muslim communities, which are unwilling to involve police in matters inside their communities, and which makes policing them difficult, as the police force is often viewed with suspicion. To counter this, the police in many places will try not to rock the boat too much, and you end up with the problems you saw in Oxfordshire.

Also, as an American citizen you would be considered ""low risk"" and thus probably not asked to even include evidence of funding in your application. Get evidence of it anyway though because chances are that you will be asked for it at the UK border. You will also 100% be asked for your CAS and information on your UK address, your university and its address, your course title and duration, and possibly other things depending on how cruel your particular border agent is. 

As regards employment, having a student visa (I'm assuming you're applying for a Tier 4 PBS visa) doesn't really help you at all except that it allows you to legally look for a job whilst your here.

The bad news here in my honest opinion is the clubs willingness to buy Costa, now I KNOW I'm in the minority here so please hear me out but his goal track record isn't anything to be starry eyed over other than this year. He seems to also be involved in a lot of negativativity. Now i don't know the guy personally but i am constantly seeing him involved in some kind of fiasco that paints him in a somewhat negative light. Lastly, the money that is floating around on what we are going to offer (even if we did offload torres and his wages) is a little more than I would feel comfortable paying for someone that has been GOOD the last few years and GREAT just this last year.

I'm still on the Lukaku train. He is scoring goals, has another year of PL experience, and would cost us nothing. I think we DO need to bring someone else in with him. But not a 40 million someone. I would even rather have torres here if we grabbed another competent goalscorer and had Lukaku too. Our money is better spent on Shaw and another midfielder imo.

true,cubs314,num14,,"I have trouble finding the humor in this whole Lamela saga. The kid was a record signing for a club that can't really afford to make big money signings every year and he has gone virtually off the radar. You would think that someone on the Spurs board would have made sure that we got SOMETHING out of a $30 million signing but, for me, this has been a disaster. 

I pray that whoever we get to take the helm next season can get the best out of the lad(s). I think Baldini's exit from the DoF role is a step in the right direction towards fixing the club as we need less separation between the backroom and coaching staffs. LVG also likes to have a lot of control of who comes and goes so perhaps it's a sign that we are preparing for his arrival. 

But let's be honest, no one could have predicted the outcome of the EPL this year. Liverpool and Everton have been doing so well while Spurs and Man Utd have been nothing more than disappointing. Spurs need to make sure that it adapts to the changing premier league and the first step in doing so is not gambling on players like Lamela or Soldado when we don't have Citeh or Chel$ki money to recoup if the transfers don't pay off.

For me, appointing a new manager will be Levy's make or break moment as a chairman as the only way we will be a 'top team' is to get someone in who is capable of getting Spurs to play their trademark attacking football, day in and day out.

There are bad writers, biased bad writers, 50 layers of crap and then there is Adrian Durham. How do guys like this get paid to write garbage? Is English press that short of good writers that they're okay with a writer who'd make even an amateur cringe, have an article published? Maybe it is time they had a look at how low can one stoop to spew hatred on a team and a player like he does in his column. 

As much as I'd love to rip apart every line of his and then use some provocative words to feel good about doing something for the horror that is,this article. 

Adrian Durham,

At least have the courtesy of telling your readers that you hate the said club and the player and hence can't have a clear mind in judging the game unbiased. 

If your sole reason - goal for writing such an article was to get under the skins of the fans then you've won it hands down. Taking a banner predominantly found at the bridge honoring John Terry and twisting it around, talks volumes about your inability to string together meaningful adjectives to describe you're beloved Steven Gerrard. If the article wasn't written to piss of the Chelsea fans then please pass on the information as to what you were high on, whilst watching the Chelsea Swansea game. Must be some powerful stuff to knock you out so much that you're probably the only one who must have thought that the Chico Flores fouls were not warranting a yellow. Even the ever biased Alan Hansen, agreed both were fouls and warranted a sending off. 

No one is asking you to love John Terry. Show the man the respect he deserves, you he lacks self belief, because of his stance on the Flores fouls, Every  player in Terry's position would've done just the same, that includes saint. Steven Gerrard. 

Also if Chelsea win the title it is because players wanted to join the team and play for the best manager, with all due respect to Brendan Rodgers he still has miles to go before he can be called the best - Just like you do, to be called a decent writer, but unlike you he has the caliber to do it.

Well the issue has been around since last December and has been making its way through the system since. There were *very* strong indications at multiple times that the data gathering was illegal.
It's now been ruled as such and the government is trying to play for more time.
I can only really see 3 scenarios here:

* The UK government is that incompetent that they just ignored this could be happening and now need more time to actually sort their shit out 

* They knew what the ruling was likely to be and decided to do no planning through choice

* They are trying to figure a way of shoehorning the data collection into an existing ""anti-terror"" law, or some such nonsense.

The fact that other countries saw this coming and acted on it almost instantly makes me think it's more likely to be the latter two.

Also keep in mind that in other countries the ISPs stopped the collection and told the government why. Our lot simply passed the buck to the government, too terrified to take action. It's quite sad, really, but it's hardly their fault.

Jesus fucking Christ. You are 100% WRONG. They two methods had a common factor, but the methods were NOT the same. We did not break any rules. How do you not understand that breaking the rules, is not the same as.... not breaking the rules? We spent money, City spent money. We spent it within the confines of the laws, City are trying to break laws. 

For instance, running someone over in a car because you lost traction in snow is not the same as running someone over in a car because you were drunk driving. But just because you had a car in both instances does not mean the methods were the same. One was accident, the other was BREAKING THE LAW. 

&gt;City is just having a harder time now because of FFP

What the hell are you on about? We had 3 good years of spending, City have had 5. City is not having any hard time whatsoever. Take a look at their fucking squad. You are just speaking nonsense at this point.

&gt; As far as Chelsea being debt free, yes, on paper they are. 

Unless you have some concrete evidence that we aren't actually debt free, please shut that bung hole. All you're doing is speculating.

&gt;I'm not even bringing up money laundering, but you just don't get rid of over £700m overnight or ""4 years"".

You're right. But you can get rid of it over 10 years (don't know where you've got 4 years from), which is exactly what we've done. Once again, your inability to interpret plain English amazes me.

It took three years for us to learn that regeneration was a thing, five to learn what a Time Lord was (let alone that the Doctor was one of them), something like fourteen before we learned there was a limit to regeneration, and so on.

Of course the transfers thing is not purely down to the manager, but you have to give him a reasonable portion of credit.

Look at how Suárez has got twice, three times as good under Rodgers, and other players have developed at an even higher rate. Dorts even snatched Mkhitaryan from our claws, understandably, and yet Liverpool seems like a more quickly progressing team and probably actually a better team than them right now.

This is not hypothetical, these are facts. I'll even help you understand just a little bit. UEFA set up an exemption with a 3 year window.

If you look at the best defenders, they are the ones who can pull of those big headers and tackles- but rarely have to. You hardly ever saw Maldini go to ground, because he defused the situation before he needed to do anything dramatic- and that is the difference between a player like Stones currently and a player like Jags, and it is also why it is an absolute no brainer to get the captain back in the side as quick as we can.

And you sound like a fucking moron incapable of comprehending anything other than his own delusions.

&gt;I've seen such a gullible person. Let me put this in perspective. Arsenal, a bigger club than Chelsea overall, are still in debt after building their stadium over 10 years ago. And their debt was only at £260m. 

LOL. What? £260m? The stadium alone cost them £500m to build and renovate/expand. You are also forgetting the amount of money we've received from winning trophies, higher paying sponsors and constantly finishing above Arsenal in the league. You sound like a deluded conspiracy theorist. If you don't have evidence that we still have debt, just stop talking.

&gt; Man U, the second biggest club in the world are struggling to get their debt. And you mean to tell me Chelsea, a previously upper mid table club, managed to wipe off £700m? Stop. You are a fool if you actually believe this.

Man UTD were poorly managed right from the start when the Glazers took over and their debt was also much larger than ours because they took out a loan to buy the club, which they never paid off and has only grown ever since and they ended up putting those numbers on the club's books. In fact its been handled so poorly that the fans want ""Glazers Out"". How fucking new are you? And you have the audacity to call me gullible. HA!

&gt;Perhaps if you actually follow the FFP, you would actually know that City and PSG were going to be investigated. 

Perhaps if you actually followed UEFA you would know that UEFA's gonna UEFA.

&gt;This is not hypothetical, these are facts. I'll even help you understand just a little bit. UEFA set up an exemption with a 3 year window. In that 3 year window, they can remove salary who are no longer with the club so it would not count towards the ffp. Carlos Tevez alone is a reduction of 9m. That list includes the Adebayor, Robinho, Bridge and even Mancini. Add to the fact that city has guys that worked on the FFP on their staff. I'm pretty sure they know what they are doing.

I said those issues were inert. Nobody hates English clubs as much as Platini. In fact, he brought in FFP just because of English clubs. Now if you're going to come around and tell me that Platini isn't going to do everything in his power to make sure he gets what he wants, you're fucking losing it, my friend. The exemption window rule wouldn't even matter if City are found guilty of trying to reroute their main source of income (owner).",0,1397601602,null,0,1397602414,0,cgteytb,t3_22xtyb,t1_cgteytb,t1_cgte7rk,null,1433371962,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

No it can't. Granted, everyone in the world could disagree with me but it still wouldn't be wrong.

How does that prove I'm wrong at all? I don't think he made very *good* runs. He got onto the end of it which wasn't *easy*, but it still didn't impress me. Also, he completely messed up the shot...

&gt; Soooo ... yeah, bam, you're wrong.

That's something I wouldn't even expect from a 12 year old. The fact that you have to reassure yourself that I'm wrong and you're right is concerning.

&gt; And, you didn't have any reasoning to show for it either

To show for what? I don't think he made any *good* runs so how could I possibly *show* any evidence for this? I'm arguing that he didn't make any good runs so there is no evidence other than the fact that there is no evidence of a good run. What did you expect me to get.. did you even think that one through?

I'll humour you and use statistics. He had **one** shot for the whole time he was on (IIRC he was on for over an hour) and the shot was a good chance and it went well wide! His passing accuracy was 67%, which again is poor for a professional footballer. (I'm not comparing himself against himself, just against the presumed standard for a professional in the Prem) And to top it off he had a whopping **zero** dribbles.

Before you start typing your big reply of rage keep in mind: none of us are *wrong*, as I've explained before. We have different opinons and that's okay. The only bad thing is when I express my opinion and you reply with such ignorance and, to a certain extent, being plain arrogant.

Then they went through Real Madrid in style during the knockouts, and lost the final by a single goal to a still-rabid Bayern.

My point is that even though I believe he is about to, Rodgers hasn't won anything quite yet. I, as much as anyone, hope Rodgers even out-Fergie's Fergie over the next two decades, but if you are just judging Rodgers and Klopp over the past season it is not a fair contest because Klopp is at a completely different point in his tenure, in a completely different league, with CL, different owners, and different expectations to meet. How do you quantify and compare something like ""managerial quality"" under those circumstances?

They are both incredible managers, and I hope Brendan and the boys never stop winning, but when they do I hope he continues to inspire them onward and upward like Klopp has managed to do at Dortmund the last few years.

But it is something we should all strive to do. History is complicated and the more angles you look at it from the more you will understand it. 

Especially when it comes to judging and understanding past events it is important to view them in their context and the history that led to them. For example I was listening to a podcast on the Red Scare in America and the historian took us back to the Napoleonic Wars to give background to it. (The idea was Napoleon's troops, who were ordinary people still inspired by the revolution, spread radical ideas where they travelled in Europe which lead to these radical ideas taking hold in the middle of the century and autocratic monarchies deporting these radicals who went to America while it was booming. Thus you had radical immigrants up to no good and spreading ideas of anarchism and communism which built up tensions to the point that they exploded in 1919 and later in the cold war.)

It also highlighted to me another point in our history that is too often compartmentalised and I'm sure Assata would agree on this one. We often divide pre-WW2 and post-WW2 in our minds and almost forget pre-WW2 altogether as irrelevant since the second world war. It's true to an extend in that it sets the scene for a lot of modern day geopolitics. But in doing that we ignore how major world powers came to be and the imperialism, genocide and injustice that came with it and how it lead to what we have today.

true,cocainesmoothie,null,null,"Yes, you are correct that Oscar and Lavezzi are different players. Yes, Oscar is younger, you are again correct. 

IF Oscar were sold off and Lavezzi came in, Lavezzi wouldn't be taking Oscar's spot. Hazard would be taking Oscar's spot while Lavezzi would take over the now vacant left wing. Further more, yes Hazard is doing great at LW but that is not his natural postion. At Lille he played the #10 role and only switched once at Chelsea since Mata had a firm grip on that position. Not to mention that a lot of people on this sub believe Hazard has a Ballon D'or in him and Messi only begun to really, really, shine once he moved central albeit in a more advanced role.

Oscar is great. Good positioning, puts in a shift defensively but I don't believe he can operate as a true #10. He can't find a true killer through ball and he just doesn't have the vision to be an orchestrator. His 2 assists this season will attest to that. And before you say its because our strikers are underperforming, Mata had a colossal amount with Torres as his primary striker.

I'm not petitioning to have Oscar sold, far from it. He's a great player and we've been winning with him. But nor is he a player, as you say, that a team could build around. So, if there's a chance to improve the team so we would be on par with the Bayern's and Real's offensively, I would have no qualms about him leaving. Remember, IF Lavezzi arrives, then we can almost assume that Cavani does as well. So just imagine

            Cavani
Lavezzi  Hazard  Willian

This is only 'chewing the fat' type of speculation, but could it be that clubs or maybe only 5 or 10 members from a club could be pressured to post something or use the opportunity of hillsborough to improve inter-club or club image relations.

However, I would like to address the points you mentioned in your post

Firstly, I of course want to thank you for paying your respect, it means a lot considering how many people booed through it in other games.

However, with regards to the booing in the opening minutes I would defend it to some extent due to the fact that the home fans want to create as much of an awful experience for the away team as possible. This is Liverpool's first big game in years and first real shot at the title (other than 2008-09), the fans are going to want to make it as awful as possible for the away team.

About the cheering as Yaya got injured, I would like to say that, to me at least, they were only cheering because he rocketed his shot and didn't actually think he was injured. I knew someone who was at the game and when I asked him about it he was surprised that I said ""Booing Yaya Toure getting injured"" because he didn't think that happened at all. Also, when Yaya Toure went off the Liverpool fans clapped him off.

Finally, about the bricks. Anfield is not the nicest area in Liverpool, I wouldn't be surprised if it was some thugs in the area and nothing to do with football. Liverpool won, so why would the fans feel the need to do that? A similar incident happened with a Hull bus a few weeks ago but it was in one of the worst parts of the city as well and the police concluded it had nothing to do with football, simply thuggery in the area, and I wouldn't be surprised if this was the case here too. Of course, even if it was a Liverpool fan, it's one stupid young moron. You can't let him speak for the remaining fans.

As I say I don't wish to invade your sub like some awful fans are doing but I don't think it's quite fair to make a thread like this claiming that Liverpool fans weren't grateful and respectful for the tribute when the majority of us really are and hate these morons as much as you do. We are complaining about it on our own sub too (http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/234jvi/man_city_fans_met_at_the_etihad_at_1507_today_to/cgti678).",0,1397611109,null,0,false,0,cgtj4qh,t3_22yd1h,t1_cgtj4qh,t3_22yd1h,null,1433373990,2,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,2
true,Staypuftmuffin,null,null,"The Doctor mentions having had children and grandchildren (Susan) in the new series, and the second Doctor was the first to mention having family at all, but says he struggles to remember them. The Seventh doctor says he doesn't know if he even has any family. Susan's (human) husband and child were killed by Daleks during the time war, but not while on Gallifrey... So I would consider them dead. Susan is said by the Doctor to be ""lost"". 

If what the Doctor says is true about his children, they either died before the time war or just didn't have a particularly close relationship with their father. In the old series, the Doctor visits Gallifrey relatively frequently. He even becomes president. And during all those visits he never mentions family. In some of the radio shows and books I believe he has a brother, Irving Braxiatel, but I don't think they were close. He might still be on Gallifrey, I think he was part of the senate. The Doctor's mother might also still be on Gallifrey, since she made an (uncredited) appearance in the new series (The End of Time).

So, I think, if he were to find Gallifrey again he might have some family to go back to, but the writers would have to add in some very convincing back story if they wanted to have him reunited with original his children.",0,1397611126,null,0,false,0,cgtj511,t3_22ys5p,t1_cgtj511,t3_22ys5p,null,1433373995,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

&gt;As far as Arsenal, he loan was for £260m. That is their debt.

That was when they took the loan yes. But if you're hovering under the assumption that Arsenal were debt free while at Highbury you are, once again, wrong. They paid £45m in 2003/04 and £32m in 2004/05 towards debt while taking an additional £233m during that time (have a read: http://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/jan/20/newsstory.sport11).

Its not relevant where those people are. UTD's debts increase with each year. But well done on trying to deflect the standing point yet again.

A new qualification that leads to an extra 2k a year will pay for itself in 5 years - by the time you're 30 you'll be 10k better off.  If you stick it in an ISA you're looking at being 2k better off after 10 years, less inflation, so actually, you'll probably just about break even.

Alternatively, fritter 5k on a van &amp; bugger off round Europe/Aus/NZ/US &amp; live on the rest for a year to expand your horizons.  You can pick up work on the way.  When you get back you'll be 10k lighter, but will have some of the best experiences of your life.  By the time you get home you'll have the people skills &amp; confidence to get a better paid job, then start rebuilding your 10k through careful living.

Plusnet is a British internet service provider (ISP). The company was founded in 1997 in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, and floated on the Alternative Investment Market in July 2004, making them a public limited company (Plusnet plc). On 30 January 2007 Plusnet was acquired by BT Group, but it continues to operate as a separate business. Plusnet also operates the Metronet brand in the UK, including pay as you host and just-the-name, as well as the Madasafish brands, Vodafone@home and the John Lewis Broadband (including Waitrose and Greenbee Broadband). In November 2013, it also took over Comms Factory, acquiring some 28,000 customers previously under the Yourcalls and 24 Talk brands. By December 2013, it had over 750,000 customers across the UK.[1]

The ""fastest ever"" broadband speeds have been achieved in a test in London, raising hopes of more efficient data transfer via existing infrastructure.

Alcatel-Lucent and BT said speeds of 1.4 terabits per second were achieved during their joint test - enough to send 44 uncompressed HD films a second.

The test was conducted on a 410km (255-mile) link between the BT Tower in central London and Ipswich.

Hi, 
 
I recently moved to BT from BE about 3 months ago, whilst I was on BE I was receiving a upload speed of 1 to 1.5Mbps but on BT it seems capped to 448Kbps on my hub, even whilst connected to the first connection point in the house/test sockets.
 
Quite irratating as it seems any streaming on the network is causing ping spikes and general network slowness
 
 
I've tried a spare router and also got 448Kbps uploads, what can I do to sort this? :smileysad:
 
Thanks!

Because your connection speed will not exceed 8mb wholesale have put you on adslmax which has a max up speed of 448. The mods can help you get moved to adsl2 and when they read the post they will offer to help. Probably tomorrow now

She says no, so he gets back in his ship and the TARDIS dematerializes. A few seconds later (according to her and the audience) , the TARDIS rematerializes and the Doctor comes back and says ""It also travels through time."" Then Rose decides to go with him.

However, if you read the wiki entry, you'll see that in between the dematerialization and return of the TARDIS, the Doctor had several adventures. What to her seems like seconds was to him, months, possibly years. The funny thing is that when the Doctor returns, he continues the conversation as if it had been a few seconds.

So the basic series of events are: War Doctor turns into Ninth Doctor-&gt; Doctor lands in London--&gt; Doctor meets Rose--&gt; Doctor defeats Nestene Consciousness--&gt; Doctor invites Rose and she says no--&gt; Doctor goes away and has adventures--&gt; decides to go back for Rose--&gt; Rose says yes.

Note 1:  By the way, why did he go back for Rose? According to the wikia, it was due to prompting by one of his companions during the trip away from her.

Note 2 ( this one might surprise you, try not to blink) : One of the companions that the Ninth Doctor meets is a woman named Sally Sparrow. Yes, *that* Sally Sparrow.  ",0,1397616195,null,0,false,0,cgtldkb,t3_233k61,t1_cgtldkb,t1_cgtkbyu,null,1433375048,9,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,9

Mata is older than Oscar and he was also our primary set piece taker(more assists came from set pieces). Levezzi would be a short time solution because of his age and he is a one trick pony. He won't add anything major to our current team. We are already loaded in that position. Oscar does what he is told to do by the gaffer. You must have seen what he does for Brazil national team. A player of his caliber are hard to come by.

There are any number of wrong-doings - from criminal negligence, manslaughter, obstruction of justice, perjury, defamation, damages... 

Ultimately, for justice to be served, the Justice system itself would also need to be held accountable for abject failures, but I am not so confident that a legal system will have the ability to fix its own illegalities. 

In terms of support through the years: 
I think Liverpool would have to be considered in parts - the then Players, Manager, Owners, Fans. 

I'm not positive that the then Owner was as vocally and unilaterally supportive of the victims, the survivors, their families. I want to clarify again, that I mean the *then* Owner. Liverpool's ownership has passed hands many times since then. 

But the players, player/Manager, Fans were and always have been supportive.

In my years as a fan, there are 4 renditions of YNWA that truly stand out to me (at least from matches I've actually been alive to watch): (1) the Champions League semi-final in 2005 against Chelsea after we got through to the Final, (2) The Champions League Final at half-time when we were 3-0 down. The song inspired us to come back and win the game, (3) The rendition of YNWA we sang against Spurs at Anfield 2 weeks ago (it just went on and on and on...I've never heard the fans continue singing it for so long before a match) and (4) the rendition against City this past Sunday. I was at my dad's house watching it and usually I sit there quietly singing it under my breath to myself but on Sunday I was standing up, arms wide above my head singing my heart out.

As for the celebrations post-City the other day...in case you weren't aware (although I think they mentioned it in the documentary tonight), Steven Gerrard's cousin was the youngest victim at Hillsborough. Stevie was 8 at the time and his cousin was 10. When I saw Gerrard burst into tears at the final whistle the other day, I followed right after. I didn't even cry when we won the European Cup in 2005, but the emotion of these past few weeks, this season, and all the developments surrounding Hillsborough over the past 18 months or so finally caught up with me (and millions of fellow fans around the world). This has been the most emotional month for me as a Liverpool supporter in almost 20 years of watching the club religiously on TV from wherever in the world I happen to be living.

Obviously it's way too early too tell if they're good enough to play professionally, because plenty of kids will fade out in their teens when everybody else develops and other kids will grow into their bodies and improve. However, if you can find one or two kids that may have that potential and bring them up through your system, then it's worth it.

The director should be commended for focusing on the relatives of the victims and the survivors' stories rather than going for dry narration of facts, it really brought home the horror of that day. And I'm glad he interviewed some of the policemen who were on duty that day, who genuinely tried to do their job and help people only to watch the tragedy unfold before them. They were affected just as much by what happened and were used by the police leadership.
However I would have liked to see more in depth discussion of just how vast was the conspiracy to smear Liverpool supporters and how far up the chain of government it went. Thatcher made no secret of her disdain for football supporters and members of her government shared her view, along with their allies in the right wing press who connived with the coverup. Perhaps there were legal reasons the director didn't delve further into what the S*n printed and with whom its editors colluded. 
And some more background on what was happening in society at large would have been helpful. The 80s were an extraordinarily harsh time for the working class thanks to Thatchers' policies, and it was reflected in what happened on the terraces. The riot fences and pens didn't appear overnight and a lot of past incidents helped pave the way for what happened at Hillsborough.
I don't want to sound too critical though, because it's a fantastic documentary. Perhaps a lot of what I mentioned was filmed but edited out for time or other reasons.

true,arrowplate,lfc12,,"Put it back in chronological order for easier reading. I've left out his replies to tweets that just wanted bring up Heysel, and also left out some supportive tweets from Man U fans.

&gt; I was thinking of my mate Tony today. He was with me when they opened the gates. I went to the stand, he went down the tunnel

&gt; I didn't see him until Sunday night. He didn't speak for ages. Then he said: 'Have you ever felt someone's ribs breaking under your feet?'

&gt; His elbow was wedged against a fella's neck. He couldn't breathe. He was begging Tony to move his elbow. He couldn't. He turned blue

&gt; As soon as the crush eased, Tony was pulled up into stands. He started pulling up people himself and helped with first aid

&gt; Imagine if you were him, or one of hundreds who ripped down advertising hoardings to make stretchers, to hear 'killed your own fans' chant

&gt; They did first aid where there was no emergency service support. We should be proud that ordinary people stepped up at time of real crisis

&gt; It was all too easy to believe that football fans - and LFC in particular, post-Heysel - were animals

&gt; But we were not. We were ordinary, decent people who loved football. Some scallies, as usual. Little trouble year before, same that day

&gt; Can't help themselves RT @Devil_Red_1878: @TonyEvansTimes Well, they weren't angels either.”

&gt; I'd love to tell you I was a hero that day. But I wasn't. I ran to back of Leppings Lane and was angry at the sunbathers. It was lovely day

&gt; Then I realised they were dead. I didn't know what to do. I was hyperventalating - so were police - and I ran away up the hill

&gt; Minutes later Dr John Ashton set up an impromptu triage centre. I knew CPR. I wish I'd have been there

&gt; Another unsung hero. He told the authorities what happened from the start. Affected his career

&gt; I'd started running and it would be a decade or more before I stopped. Still not sure I have

&gt; After I left the ground I was in a daze. I went to the last pub we were in. The locals were drinking. The landlady recognised me

&gt; She said they were shut but then saw I was pale and shaking. She asked what was wrong. I said there were loads dead. She turned on TV

&gt; She gave me large scotch. Said: How many?' I said: 'More than Heysel.' She asked how many that was. I told her. 39. She didn't believe me

&gt; I said I'd seem more bodies. But I clearly hadn't. I was in a confused state. She made me drink the whiskey and gave me a pint.

&gt; She said 'go and meet your mates.' I went to the car and sat on the kerb. It seemed for ages

&gt; When my little brother came back I nearly hit him. He was in Leppings Lane. He knew it so was on side but I was angry

&gt; The drive home was horrible. The death count building and just groans, no conversation

&gt; Every phone box had a queue. It was how I imagined a routed army retreated: I'm panic

&gt; We got home and went to the Fountains Abbey on Walton Road. We did ring round. I phone Big Al's mother. Said he was alright and I'd seen him

&gt; We walked down to the Hamlet on Scotland Road. My cousin was in there with a bunch of his mates. They'd been at Villa Park. They were crying

&gt; Everyone looked at me in shock. None of us had seen him. I can't imagine why I said it. Thank Christ he was OK

&gt; When they saw us. Then I went home. I sat down in house and broke down. Crying, swearing, bereft. Christ, I didn't know then how bad it was

&gt; The next day was surreal. The sun was out but the misery cast a cloud everywhere.

&gt; I didn't know then that I'd started a nervous breakdown that would last five years (and the rest). I'd gone to a match to have a good time

&gt; And if it's affected my life so badly, image what it's done to the people who really suffered.

&gt; In the years after, especially when I've lived in London, people would say the same thing to me. 'admit it. You were all drunk, broke gates'

&gt; 'Robbed from dead, pissed on police.' I'd answer this: 'Would you do it?' No. 'Then why the fuck would you think I would?' No one answered

&gt; When I say 'we' I don't mean just Liverpool fans. The draconian and stupid policing that still goes on undermines supporters' rights

&gt; Just for everyone's info: I'm in Italy. Yet again I've run away. I didn't want to be home yesterday.

&gt; I'll get to bed eventually. I was 28 a quarter of a century ago. Nearly half a lifetime away. It's cast a huge shadow over my life

&gt; Who experiences mass death? Soldiers, sadly. Not many civilians. I've been around it twice. The first time I didn't know until next morning

&gt; And that was horrible. Because I knew, at Heysel, I was a very small part of a causal chain that led to tragedy

&gt; At Hillsborough it was different. The blame was thrown at people who were innocent. It was to deflect responsibility

&gt; Now is not the time but in coming weeks I'll talk about Heysel if you want to. I'd google my 2005 piece first. Or read Far Foreign Land

&gt; I can't do shit to change anything to do with Islam,

&gt; Islam needs to change from the inside out, not the outside in.

You are seeing all Muslims as this monolithic group, who act in unison and agreement. That is not the case. It is a broad and diverse collection of individuals, some of whom are criminals, some of whom are normal and reasonable people, just as in society as a whole.

You seem to imply that if a crime is commited by a Muslim, you have no right to comment, and only other Muslims are allowed to intervene. That is not the case; everyone should, and that applies across all groups, regardless of religion or ethnicity of the perpetrator.

One of mine is a woman who lost her home to her abusive husband. She's been staying at friends since then, and we took her in about 2 weeks ago. She claimed ESA on the day she moved in, and still hasn't heard back. She was a house wife, she lived off her husbands income. Now she has nothing. She's struggling to find work due to her age and back problems (hence ESA) since she worked in care. Jobseekers decline her a food voucher because her claim hasn't been processed yet, so she doesn't show up on their system. 

There's no crisis loan for her take out, as the local council are still awaiting proof of her claim before they'll put her on housing benefits, therefore be able to lend her anything.

The woman went from house wife to homeless with nothing in a matter of days. Now the system doesn't want to know, and won't acknowledge their clerical error. She's due to collect yet another food voucher from me this afternoon, and I know she'll be in floods of tears because she'll feel humiliated having to get help yet again.

If it's milk chocolate easter eggs (and they probably are), there is so much fat in them, that your dog probably isn't at risk from eating anything but multiple eggs (the bigger the dog the bigger the dangerous amount).

In short: unless you buy green and blacks 90% cocoa solids easter eggs for your children, then things aren't quite as bad as this article at first makes you think.

true,Calculators_are_fun,null,null,"&gt; How is it that anyof our citizens need charity handouts to survive?

A variety of reasons. [Here's a good FT graphic](http://blogs.ft.com/off-message/2014/02/24/a-different-banking-crisis/reasons-for-food-bank-use-trussell-trust/)

1) For a start, benefits can take up to 6 weeks to kick in. I've always said this is insane.  I have nothing but contempt for the idiot jobsworths that staff the JCP and in councils who fail to inform people they are entitled to a crisis loans in various formats. As well as the further knob ends in low level JCP 'advisory' roles who think it's their job to stop people claiming for the stupidest of reasons. 

Subnote: Benefit 'changes' don't happen overnight. You can have a year or more advance warning of benefit changes, yet a large % of people noted these changes were the reasons for using a food bank. This slips into point #2

2) A shocking lack of financial education. Very few people have a financial cushion in the form of savings.  My own family have absolutely none despite earning excellent salaries. We overpay our mortgage instead. But I had to learn about debt, finance, credit cards etc to avoid myself spending into a black hole. There should be compulsory financial education in schools. 

3) Unsustainable debt. See point number 2.

Others: Domestic violence (i.e. fleeing a partner, slipping through the cracks). Homelessness (difficulty in obtaining benefits). Sickness. Refused STBA (short term benefit advance) and / or crisis loan (same thing really).

I would say all of those demonstrate:

1) A lack of personal responsibility

2) Faceless government bureaucracy

Both of which epitomises being one of the wealthiest countries int he world. There is absolutely no reason we should have homeless people, or some relying on food banks. But there is a chunk of people who do rely on them in the short term. But it does seem there is a lack of responsibility from both the person AND government. A failure on both ends that needs to be picked up by charitable organisations with a short term food bundle.

I'd like to finish on this point:

- These data collected actually are not realistic. Because they only measure the amount given out, we have no realistic knowledge on how many people rely on food banks over a medium/long term (i.e. moving around different banks as you can only use them 3 times) or rely on other, more patchy solutions (charity from friends/neighbours/relatives) or local charities not related to the Tussel trust.

There IS clearly a problem, and to find the solution, we need to have realistic proposals. But I don't believe you will ever find a 100% solution.

true,_lolwhat_,IM,isle of man,"Are you really this dense? I am saying the club are debt free, simply because of Roman. The club did not become debt free by winning or growth of the club. 

The club became ""debt free"" at the end of 2009. But, with your link, I will play along for 2012-13. The club had a turnover of 256m. With wages and other expenses (operating income), they had a total earnings before interest and taxes of 5.5m. The previous two seasons, Chelsea has spent £200m in player transfers. I mean, I do hope you realize that the numbers are even more skewed in the earlier years as they do not have the turnover now. 

So, let us go back in 2009. Just a quick search, and you will find this Chelsea statement. ""Following previous conversions of half of the debt, the remainder of the interest-free loans from the parent company, whose ultimate controlling party is Roman Abramovich, have been converted into equity making the group effectively debt free."" Do you know how much it was? £340m. So yes, Chelsea essentially became debt free overnight. This was done as a precursor to FFP. 

I am going to lump Arsenal and Man U as they are pretty much in the same situation. Arsenal and Man U had an initial debt, but, with their plan on refinancing and fixed lower interest long loans the debt number initially ""went up"". With the ""new"" debt, they are now able pay a lump sum to their initial loan/bonds, etc. So no, Man Us debt hasn't increased over the years. It has actually went down to £367. Again, these guys are billionaires for a reason.

It's really simple. When you have a total turnover of £910m over 6 years, while spending about £750m in wages and you add in over £400m in player transfers. Yes, already operating at loss with just wages and players transfers alone. No money to repay the money Roman has put in.

You see, I asked you these questions in order for you to actually think, instead of just googling information like you usually do. Chelsea didn't become debt free from success or smart business decisions alone. The majority of it was cleared by Roman. But, of course you chose to ignore this fact.

I have a private room with en-suite bathroom. The room next to me was vacated yesterday and is still waiting for a patient. If I look out of my window I can see one the closest of the shared bed wards (6-beds) is currently only half-full. The beds crisis doesn't seem to be in full effect [at this hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Medical_Centre) at least.

Sure, if I look around my room the decor is extremely dated and some of the fittings do look a bit shabby (most of the stuff in the room looks straight out of the 60's).   I mean yeah, of course a big widescreen telly in every room would be nice, but I'd rather the money be spent on doctors, nurses &amp; treatment. Leave the fancy three-course menus and plasma TVs for those willing to pay the extra for a Bupa bed.

I totally disagree with the creeping privatization of the NHS as started covertly by the previous government and its continued blatant encroachment by the current one. I can't possibly see how it's going to be cheaper to sub-contract out cleaning, catering, maintenance, etc. to third party companies rather than have dedicated NHS departments doing the jobs. Maybe profit making companies will figure out how to do everything cheaper and more efficiently, although I highly doubt it.

For now I'm just glad that the involvement of private companies is being limited to certain specific fields, although speaking to many of the ancillary staff here lots of them have concerns about their jobs once their departments are taken over by private enterprise.

That isn't incorrect.

Once again no! It's just not, because you have to factor in a lot of things.

Our modern profit-driven society is like that; circular; so many of the jobs people do don't actually NEED to be done; so many people that do work pretend all the time to be enthusiastic and care about the company and improving effectivenesses and keeping costs down when in reality no-one gives a shit. Just saying the right things to get ahead.

We live in a country where people work crazy long hours for little reward, little free time, and little desire to do a good job. Work-life balance for many is completely up the creek. We have students paying and indebting themselves ridiculously to struggle through degrees while living on hardly anything, not having time to take a part-time job to make ends meet because of increasingly competitive university courses; a First is devalued from what it was, from what our parents encouraged us to go to uni for; and competition from international students. Even when you try to get a job, no joy, because youre competiting with school kids who'll cost less, and people with years of experience who've been laid off from their own jobs. A cycle no-one can win.

These are the problems driving people to food banks; a realisation that if you're scraping by on 56 quid a week or whatever and you could get some 'free' food (a term that's highly suggestive of thievery; its DONATED food that would go to waste if you didnt take it) that could let you keep more money for your heating or your electric bill, maybe that would be a good idea. Even so, the British psyche is too proud to consider this anything but a shameful last resort.

Everyone knows the causes but they are so many no-one is willing to talk about reforming the system to be better equipped to deal with this. At least by using suggestive language when reporting on these cases they can weaken public support for such issues and demonise those who use food banks; just so that people keep paying for price hiked and overpriced food from the supermarkets and they can profit more from the poor as well as their own underpaid staff. Insidious, that's what it is. Its not just a problem you can easily diagnose and fix like that, but it doesnt help when no-one seems to actively care about the situation.

And yes, some of the people that claim, you may think are scum-of-the-earth types. But if you believe in their right to have food, you have to concede that they need food banks, because how else to get food than a food bank or stealing?

The it goes on to confuse me:

Virgin payed £40m

Northern Rail payed £36m

Transpennine payed £21m

So where's the other £100m?

So it could be somewhere between £1-£4bn subsidy, of which between £100-£200m has lined the shareholders pockets.

Unemployment is down and yet people are still going to food banks. Why could that be? The jobs aren't paying. People are being pushed further and further into poverty. Zero hour contracts are good for businesses but not for the individuals and leaves them very little or no rights. David Cameron recently stated, ""We want to make work pay"". Well evidently that's not happening. The plan is not working, unless of course the plan was to suck up to big business, give mates a tax break and **** over the working classes. Perhaps the minimum wage needs adjusting? Not everyone can turn up to the House of Lords for five minutes and claim their £300.

We've never had so many millionaires in this country, yet there people people queuing for food hand-outs because they can't afford to EAT. Millionaire's are getting a £40,000 TAX CUT while this is happening.

What's the solution? Pay better wages? How do we get there? Build more houses, bring down the welfare bill, stimulate the economy and create jobs. Surely that's a better solution than keep house prices inflated with a 'help to buy' scheme. People wouldn't need help to buy if prices were more reasonable. Why is the Government footing the bill for this rather than solving the actual problem?

This Government should be ashamed.

My understanding is that food banks have always up to now been patchwork, localised and not in massive demand throughout the UK. In the past few years there's been a lot of publicity (people not knowing they existed previously - I also understand that up until fairly recently foodbanks only accepted GP referrals) etc which pushes up numbers.

&gt;I disagree with point 4. The 90s recession involved tens of thousands of homes being repossessed, it was horrendous in actual impact on the ground even if the GDP contraction was less.

It's about demographics. Look at the food bank stats and you'll see that the majority of users are entirely dependent on benefits, homeless, in domestic violence situations or 'other'.  

Whilst I don't disagree the 90's recession was nasty (the last recession was actually the dot-com bubble, and what I was referring too - although was that technically a recession in the UK?) 

Let's go back to the 90's  I guess. Homes being repossessed indicates a more sophisticated dependency. A mortgage no matter how shaky usually reflects a more stable financial position. A job (or two in the household) access to credit, short term loans etc.

Wikipedia informs me that the tussel trust only ran 2 food banks in 2004. That indicates to me that prior to the 08 crash and long term recession - food banks were as I mentioned earlier, a more localised and patchy covering.

""One of the reasonable Liverpool supporters, and there are many, told me that these people who flirt around the internet abusing folk don’t represent the football club. And therein lies the real problem for Liverpool, they do. Right now it is a larger section of their fans who engage in this behaviour than any other club, and that reflects badly. Anytime a supporter of another club jokes about Hillsborough it harms the reputation of the team they follow just as anytime people see Liverpool fans dishing out threats and abuse, it harms the reputation of the club.""

The sad fact is. The morons that have invaded this sub, Bricked the bus  ect. You claim they aren't liverpool fans. They are. It brings your club down and gives you a severely bad reputation.

And your reply here just shows that you have not read my comment. I said that *if* Liverpool don't win the league, the framing of Gerrard's moment changes. Many are ready to proclaim that as a crucial turning point, and if Liverpool do win the league, it will be widely declared as the turning point that won it for them. If they don't win the league, it could instead be seen as the turning point that lost it. Anyone who has any grasp of history will understand the kind of thing I've talking about - when we look back we look at key events, and the effect they had on the unfolding of subsequent events. You cannot definitively declare the effect of something until it has happened. 

It's ironic that you accuse me of misunderstanding history (again, to reiterate, that is not remotely relevant to my comment anyway) when you are unable to grasp a basic concept like this.

It's vaguely disappointing that I'm trying to raise a point for discussion, and you just hurr durr in here, completely misunderstand what I'm saying, and then direct unfounded criticisms towards me for saying it.

Smaller companies and other self-employed people were pretty much always fine.

I got very fed up with spending the majority of my time either chasing invoices and on admin, or pitching for new work rather than actually doing work. 

Pitching also frequently involved being asked to write business plans, which should really be a billable task in itself.

It also made me loathe that I was in danger of becoming racist because I'd had so many bad experiences with businesses run by one particular racial group/nationality, which I had to make a business decision about avoiding working with despite really struggling with the idea and thinking that every time should be unique, despite repeat evidence.

If I had continuously earned what I made when I was actually doing billable work, on a regular basis, then I'd comfortably have been in the top tax bracket, not avoiding paying tax. But that just doesn't happen and some months I had absolutely no income whatsoever, despite being owed several grand on paper.

'Self-employment' is frequently a step down from zero-hour contracts really, and involves even less admin and paperwork on behalf of the companies using contractors.

true,Quagers,null,null,"&gt;**Where am I allowed to wild camp in the British Isles?**

&gt;Strictly, all land in England and Wales is owned so you must gain permission before camping. However, wild camping within reasonable limits is often tolerated in many upland and remote areas, particularly in Snowdonia and the Lake District.

&gt;One exception is Dartmoor, where camping is allowed for up to two consecutive nights in the same spot or for longer in a permitted camping area, except within 100 metres of a public road or in any enclosure or other restricted area.

&gt;Wild camping in Scotland was made legal in 2005 after a campaign by groups such as the Ramblers. You can camp wild on hill land but should respect any nearby dwellings or livestock. The exception is the east part of Loch Lomonds National Park, where wild camping (and alcohol) was banned in 2010 due to antisocial behaviour such as noise, littering and vandalism, with a consultation held in 2012 to discuss extending the ban to four islands in the area.

&gt;In Ireland, wild camping is not strictly legal but is tolerated in many upland and remote areas, and the Northern Ireland Forestry Service issues camping permits at some of its sites.

So basically in England no, not without permission. However a lot of people do, if so make sure you are respectful, leave no trace and ""arrive late leave early"".

For more info google ""Wild Camping"", the Lake Districts advice is,

&gt;In the past, camping has often been tolerated as long as people:

&gt;camp above the highest fell wall, well away from towns and villages

&gt;leave no litter - this includes not burying any litter and removing other people's

&gt;don't light any fires, even if there is evidence that fires might have been lit

&gt;stay for only one night

&gt;keep groups very small - only one or two tents

&gt;camp as unobtrusively as possible with inconspicuous tents which blend in

&gt;leave the campsite as you would want to find it

&gt;carry out everything you carried in

&gt;carry out tampons and sanitary towels. Burying them doesn't work as animals dig them up again

&gt;choose a dry pitch rather than digging drainage ditches around a tent or moving boulders

&gt; Baljit Ubhey, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""This case has been reviewed by a senior lawyer and it has been decided that a prosecution is not required in the public interest.

There are many more, go google it.

http://www.cps.gov.uk/victims_witnesses/resources/prosecution.html

&gt; Each case the prosecution service receives from the police is reviewed to make sure that it is right to proceed with a prosecution. In more serious or complex cases, prosecutors are responsible for deciding whether a person should be charged with a criminal offence, and if so, what that offence should be.

&gt; When deciding whether a case should be prosecuted in the courts, prosecutors consider the alternatives to prosecution in appropriate circumstances. This includes a simple or conditional caution for adults or, for youths, a reprimand, warning or conditional caution.

&gt; When we receive a file from the police, a prosecutor will read the papers and decide whether or not there is enough evidence against the defendant and whether a prosecution is required in the public interest. Because circumstances can change, the prosecutor keeps the case under continual review. If the prosecutor is thinking of changing the charges or stopping the case, he or she will contact the police wherever possible. This gives the police the chance to provide more information that may affect the decision.

&gt; Although the police and the CPS work closely together, we are completely independent of each other and the final responsibility for the decision as to whether or not to proceed with an offence that has been charged rests with the prosecution service.

From your comment:

&gt; Not least because it would leave victims of car theft wide open to intimidation.

That would be the job of the police to investigate whether intimidation was used, and that would be a separate offence. It is still up to the crown prosecution service to decide if charges should be brought in the public interest.

I'll just reiterate that last part;

&gt; Although the police and the CPS work closely together, we are completely independent of each other and the final responsibility for the decision as to whether or not to proceed with an offence that has been charged rests with the prosecution service.

So to summarise from my original comment; if the property has been returned, and the original owner does not want to press charges, and it is not in the public interest to prosecute, they will most likely drop the charges.",0,1397650026,null,0,false,0,cgttv9k,t3_2359h3,t1_cgttv9k,t1_cgtszv9,null,1433379116,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,DaceX,lfc55,,"&gt; He was a treat to watch in full form

This is where I start asking questions about Torres. What is the benchmark for his form?? His early career? First few seasons at Liverpool? Or his Chelsea career. 

Personally looking at his career I would describe Torres as a 1 in 3 striker(stats back this up, if you look at his career goals ratio's season by season, it is immediately obvious that its his first few seasons at Liverpool which were an anomaly in an otherwise non prolific career). I would say he is not as bad as he seems now but not as good as his early Liverpool days.

But there is another question to consider when it comes to players, and thats exactly how many games does a player have in his legs?? Fernando Torres has only just turned 30 yet he has already played more club appearances than the 36 year old Didier Drogba (422 Torres, 416 Drogba). If I were a Chelsea supporter I would be looking to offload him this summer because at his age, with his injury record, and his playing style I can honestly see Torres struggling to become a 1 in 3 striker again.

Islam came about in 632 AD roughly. There have been millions or billions of people who have written , interacted with, developed various parts of the concept that is known as ""Islam"". This means that Islam is not one thing. If you were introduce just doctrinal or philosophical conditions that ""Islam"" has developed - you'd be stuck at around 20 or so different interpretations , knowledge bases, interpretative frameworks etc. 

This is without taking into account geography, class, ethnic boundaries and social interactions with ""non-Islam"" factors that account for that amount of time. On top of that they don't account for that amount of people. 

You are happy to identify all that as ""Islam"". The basic premise and the basic logic of your reasoning is flawed just by looking at the established conditions. There is no rigour in the argument.

I don't think you understand quite what a turning point is, judging by this comment. How anyone could not see the potential significance of the moment is beyond me.

Much of this discussion is speculative and hypothetical, so it does not surprise me the subtlety and nuances are going completely over your head.

That is shutting it down. Saying something is ""irrelevant"", ""ridiculous"" and then ""rejecting it"" is shutting down discussion in a nutshell. It also shows your inability to consider ideas other than your own, but I think that's another issue. It's also saddening that you think my comment is irrelevant, considering it was a direct response to someone talking about a similar topic - that's not irrelevant, it's how discussion begins. Saddening that you don't appear to know what irrelevant means, and also saddening that you are so determined to stamp out discussion you don't like.

I'm sure even you can see the ridiculousness of your response. I essentially said something along the lines of ""Huh, that's interesting, if this happens it could be that..."" and you responded with ""NO! YOU'RE WRONG!"". Not difficult to see the issue there.

Nope. That's your privilege and not my duty. I didn't employ it as an argument, just told you why one shouldn't use it. If you want to continue to employ it, I'm sure there's a ton of e-books on logic ,logical postivism, its success and its failure out there. After all entire departments of Philosophy grads have to do something. 

I based my argument on observing you ,and you repeated the error. The fact remains that the phrase you used is intellectually unsustainable. The conditions for it to exist are so broad and complex it makes almost impossible to substantiate and claim. 

However, you used it as a truism despite that and it has become a stock phrase that people like to repeat that betrays an unthinking prejudice that you should address.

This in no way says you can't have an opinion about what we call Islamic history or society, but if you wish to continue to hold them than the strength of those arguments and convictions will come from a detailed understanding of the complexities.

true,E_mE,eu,"Berlin, DE","Technically Germany has ""multi-payer health care system"", by law everyone who resides here must have health insurance. So there are two classes of health insurance, you have the non-profit sickness funds who must insure you regardless of any conditions you may have, so that kind of constitutes as a public health (which was started in 1880, yes Germany has the worlds oldest public health system). This is paid via your pay packet. It currently stands at ~15%, which half is paid by the employer and the other half by your self. So when you look at your pay slip you see your exact health insurance contribution (exactly the same mechanism as the pension, which stands at 19%). 

If you're unemployed and claiming benefits the state pays its. Everyone has to pay money into these sickness funds, unless you earn more then ~4500€/month, which you can then opt out of paying the sickness funds. But you must then get private health insurance, but then you can see this equivalent to the American system where pre-existing conditions, age and other attributes are taken into account. If you have been paying private healthcare most of your life and suddenly you no longer can afford it or so, you will find it more difficult to get back onto the public health system, since you've not really contributed. But as I say, its law that you must be insured, so I'm not sure how that part works as I will never attempt it my self as I'm not a believer in private health insurance or any conditions applied to it. 

Now, when you go to hospital, clinic or where ever, you must present you health card, which the institution will then defer any costs to the sickness fund/insurance provider. You never have to give out money for healthcare unless it's considered something which is not really considered essential healthcare. For example, if you go to the dentist and require a filling, the dentist will ask you ""Do you want the ordinary metal based filling or for an extra numbers of €'s, you can have a white filling"". so you get a choose, but the ordinary filling is free and so is check ups etc.

One of the nice advantages of the German system in my opinion is the encouragement of preventative medicine/care, if you take up a sporting activity via your gym or go for regular checkups at the dentist or doctor etc, you get bonus points and money back from your healthcare provider as an incentive. It's a great idea and something I think the UK system really is missing, as they're not really into providing preventive mechanisms, only curative medicine.

A personal situation which recently occurred for me, was my girlfriend recently started getting serve vertigo, which we first went to a doctor who didn't really know what it was, but gave her some medicine etc, but also a referral to a specialist. No you have the choice of which specialist to go and see, so in this case it was a Nose, throat and ear. We phone up one place who gave us an appointment in 3 odd days, but she was still suffering a lot, so we decided to just go to the local hospital which had a ""Nose, throat and ear"" department, we went their, shows our card and the referral and within 30mins sure was seen by a ""Nose, throat and ear"" doctor who diagnosed in a few minutes, she was given instructions and outline of who to care for the problem. All was solved quickly and easily.  

This roughly sums it up.

TL;DR: Germany has a public health care system run by private institutions (hospitals, clinics, specialists etc).",0,1397654058,null,0,false,0,cgtv0zl,t3_2361oa,t1_cgtv0zl,t1_cgttpfd,null,1433379675,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,lawschoolzombie,null,null,"Have thought about it extensively. 

First our line-up. I hope Hazard is fit by then because he was a game changer in the match earlier in the season. We also need Salah available later in the game (will explain why). Last, we need our back four to sit deep. Here's how I think we should line-up.

Cech


Iva-Cahill-Terry-Dave

Luiz-Matic

Willian-Hazard-Schurrle

Eto'o

Let me explain why I think we should do this, and why I think Jose will go for this:

1) Back Four - Stability and positioning *inter-se* will be key in this match. We need our back four to communicate with each other, and most importantly we need them to bully Suarez and Sturridge. 

Additionally, we need Ivan to stay back. We need Dave to cut out wingers running down (just like he did with Man City) going till the half line and then withdrawing back to position. 

Last, we need our defence to sit deep deep deep. This poses problems of transition in play and that brings me to...


2) Why Luiz? - A defender who is a midfield destroyer? Sold! We need him to settle back and defend the paceless Terry and step in when Ivan goes too high up the pitch. We also need him to rough up along-side Matic, the Coutinho (keeping this guy quiet will be the ultimate key) + Gerard combo when they venture forward.

Matic along-side Luiz has proven very effective previously and we need them to do it again. Also Luiz is very cynical at breaking up play, can take up a yellow etc. and we may very well need to do that to keep Liverpool quiet for all of 90 minutes.

Also, Luiz can take the ball forward and (a) transition to mid-field - he does this poorly, but much better than Ramires, and will get much less tired as the match wears on than Lampard; (b) can lob balls up the pitch, he isn't superb at this either, but it keeps the opposition on their toes.

3) Mid-field - Willian to shut Gerard (primary) + Glen Johnson and Lucas/Allen. Schurrle on Sterling patrol. And Hazard for the counters.

4) Eto'o - this is a fifty / fifty choice but I go with Eto'o because (a) he has a slimy habit of getting between defences; and (b) Torres at Anfield I am not too sure of; oh and (c) Ba for the latter half of the match when Liverpool tire.

5) Subs: Mourinho's speciality... mhmm... we wait for them to tire out and based on how the match flows, and assuming we still need goals by the time 45 minutes are up, this is what we should do. Bring on Ba for Eto'o at 70. Bring on Salah for Schurrle at 45-60 (depending on how effective Schurrle is). Keep the remaining open ended based on how the team is doing.

So what would be our gameplan? Exactly the same as it was against the Man City juggernaut. Careful tracking of players, have our defenders break up play, and have our forwards run down the pitch at top speed and hope to take our chances.

We just need Liverpool to believe they have a shot in the first 15 minutes for them to get careless. No matter what everybody else believe, I was watching the Man City game, and their Coutinho goal was completely against the run of play. They were getting shredded by Man City till that goal happened. So yes, I agree with what someone else said that this will be a lot about the temperament of the players but also about the preparation for the match, and we all know what Mourinho excels at.

We outweigh them man for man, save for our strikers (for which they bitch-slap us and make us their prison bitch), but I think Mourinho will account for this. What we need to make sure is not give Suarez or Sturridge **any** space in our third.

I think one of two things will happen, either we win 3-0, or we draw 1-1, I don't see anything else happening.

On 33k I can sustain an average mortgage, household bills and support my wife if she should lose her job. If we cut down we could live quite comfortably and as we are thinking about kids, the sums are currently being done. There's no problem there.

As I have mentioned at least twice in this thread, I find the fact JSA can take up to 6 weeks to kick in is criminal. I have nothing but contempt for councils and the JCP.

The fact remains, the cap is not responsible for food bank usage. There has to be some element of personal problems if the equivalent of a £33k wage isn't enough to buy food.

If you allow state funded religious schools - and the UK has done that for a long time -, then expect to have to deal with this kind of nonsense.

As an atheist, I find it deeply discriminatory - it means there are many religious schools with admissions preferences that discriminate against my family on the basis of faith, and in many areas this means people of no faith or different faith from the nearby faith schools get access to better education (though reading the Ofsted report for this school, *this one* is no great loss; near us, though, one of the best schools is Catholic).

But basically: What goes around, comes around. It was British christians that started the faith-school nonsense in the first place. At least the system now allows state funding of schools tied to other religions too. Hopefully that'll eventually get controversial enough to get the system abolished.

true,Nowimnotalurker,flair-norwichcity,"Ruddy marvellous ","Hello!

1) although on paper the 11th place finish last year seems impressive, in reality until the second last game of the season we were in serious danger of going down, and it was two cracking results against west brom (4-0) and man city (3-2) that catapulted us up the table. That was our warning, and although Hughton did buy some good players, unfortunately his negative style (playing for draws, aiming just to clinch one goal and then sit back and defend, etc.) has really hurt us this season. The main problem though has been our away form: we have only own twice and drawn twice on the road this season, which has meant that we were never able to get any momentum to start climbing the table with any consistency.

2) Relegation, to be honest. 4 games left vs. Liverpool (who we always do great against), Man U, Chelsea, and Arsenal, and you couldn't say you expect to get any points out of those. Always time for a miracle though...

3) This is a tough one - none of the managers I had on my list for potential replacements for Hughton will want to manage in the championship, and if we do stay up it seems very harsh to sack Neil Adams for doing a good job. Pass.

4) Good signings: Leroy Fer, Martin Olsson, Nathan Redmond, Yobo (January)
Wish we hadn't of signed: Luciano Becchio - he had a great thing going at Leeds and we've kind of wrecked him, which I do feel bad about. If we do get relegated though at least we might potentially have a good championship striker who wants to stay.
'Bad' signings: the obvious one, Van Wolfswinkel. From a neutral's perspective 1 goal is pretty shocking, but if definitely do not wish that we hadn't signed him - he does show glimpses of quality and his record speaks for himself: I really do think that it's just a crisis of confidence.

5) Best player: Martin Olsson for me: consistent, very solid, and a pretty good attacking threat. Fer and howson come a close joint second, but fer's dip in form around Christmas hurt him, and while howson was absolutely phenominal pre-injury, since coming back he hasn't quite reached the same standards (although he has been good).
Best young'un: Redmond. A bit selfish/wild at times in front of goal, but for a 19 year old he is absolutely fantastic, and a really exciting player to watch. Josh Murphy (FA youth cup winner) Is also developing nicely
Most Improved: Howson. Last season he was wasn't bad, but nothing special. This season however he has really turned it on, and has emerged as one if the club's best players.

6) The 11/12 season 15 goals Grant Holt. I know we've had some absolute crackers like Huckerby and sutton (although that was a long time ago now), but we really miss a Leader both on and off the pitch, as well as a target man. Our passing through the middle is hit and miss, and so it would be lovely to have someone with the drive and areal ability that we could just hoof it up to.

7) Well that's a really tough one /s. Suarez. We need a striker who can score goals, and he obviously can. Add to that he fact that whenever he has played at Carrow road he has scored a hat trick and we should be in for quite a season! To send to you guys? Hard. Bradley Johnson has been getting on my nerves this season and I can't understand why Adams picked him instead of tettey on Saturday, but he was great last season, so he does have it in him to be quality. Probably one of our no hope youth academy guys tbh :p

8) Best: Grant Holt header in front of the Kop to make it 1-1 in our first season back in the premier league
Worst: take your pick really, but the 5-2 last season at Carrow road would be mine because that's the only one that I have had the horrific experience of seeing live.

9) Danger man: Snodgrass. We are not going to be having a lot of chances, and hence that's why it's all the more important that he is on his free kick taking game. He can float some delightful balls into the box from corners/free kicks, and he is in pretty rich (for us at least) goalscoring form.

10) Honestly? 5-1 to you guys! You all seem so up for it and I'm not sure Adams has the tactical nous to be able to throttle your attack (although it doesn't seem like any manager does at the moment!)

I don't see the growth in usage as evidence that there has been a huge rise in people who simply won't eat without them, I see the growth as a result of a service and access to that service expanding. And more importantly, I don't begrudge anyone for using the service (although I do begrudge one for rejecting several crates of organically grown fresh vegetables that were surplus from my inlaws garden).",0,1397657419,null,0,false,0,cgtwaj6,t3_235typ,t1_cgtwaj6,t1_cgtue74,null,1433380259,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,[deleted],null,null,"Wow, first post response in this thread to me already brings up Christianity. I'll respond to the point about JW's and why they don't commit violent acts. How about this reason: The New Testament, and JW theology is genuinely peaceful. Not peaceful in the Muslim sense of the word, where if you do whatever they say and want you will be quite safe. But as in peaceful like Jesus, where the more devout people give more of their lives to charity and the poor. 

In any case, even if you disagree with this sentiment it doesn't matter. Christian's numbers are declining. And will more than likely be as good as zero in a few decades. Christianity, and the behaviour of Christians, is pretty much a non-issue. 

On what basis do I assume fundamentalist numbers are growing? Well, the exponential growth of  people wearing the burka in my area. From zero 10 years ago. To dozens today. To presumably hundreds in a decade from now. And thousands in a few decades. 

Even if just a fixed percentage of say 10% of Muslims total are this fundamentalist, the doubling of Muslim numbers in this country in the last decade, means that the number of fundies double. I suspect fundamentalism, being the disease that it is, breeds fundamentalism though. You wouldn't have seen bullshit like a poster saying music is forbidden in a school 2 decades ago, yet here we are today. That's going to sink into those children's conscience, and some will surely take it to heart. Thereby increasing the fundie population further. Then of course we have the pressure the more fundamentalist elements of the Muslim community are more than happy to pile on the more moderate sections of the Muslim community. e.g. in France where Muslims who don't want to wear the headscarf are bullied and harassed.

While Goldwater said some really stupid things, he also said some really smart things, particularly when it comes to religion in government.  He predicted several decades ago that the religious right in the republican party would cause problems, and it's worked out very much like he predicted.

&gt;“On religious issues there can be little or no compromise. There is no position on which people are so immovable as their religious beliefs. There is no more powerful ally one can claim in a debate than Jesus Christ, or God, or Allah, or whatever one calls this supreme being. But like any powerful weapon, the use of God’s name on one’s behalf should be used sparingly. The religious factions that are growing throughout our land are not using their religious clout with wisdom. They are trying to force government leaders into following their position 100 percent. If you disagree with these religious groups on a particular moral issue, they complain, they threaten you with a loss of money or votes or both.

The British school system encourages parent involvement to the extreme, and the current government is taking that even further. That includes the ability for parents to organise groups to set up public faith schools or take over the running of existing schools in some circumstances.

Further, there's not really been ""secular"" schools per se in the UK until very recently. There used to be a legal requirement to have christian prayer in British state schools. This has been softened up to a ""broadly christian"" ""collective act of worship"", but British state funded schools still give christianity preference *except* for in faith schools, where worship can occur in accordance with a religion specified for the school.

In other words: This is how the UK school system works. When the system is explicitly set up to allow religious organisations to take over the running of publicly funded schools, or set up their own, and doing so is the most effective way for non-Christians to avoid having their children subjected to Christian worship, then one should not be surprised when they take advantage of that - including groups people dislike.

In other words: The blame for this lays at the feet of British Christians who set up a system that was explicitly intended to ensure religious indoctrination in British schools in the first place.

true,rubygeek,null,null,"&gt; How about this reason: The New Testament, and JW theology is genuinely peaceful.

Consider that The New Testament is a holy text to muslims as well. And that many muslim sects are *also* genuinely peaceful.

My point was that you generalised well over 1 billion people based on assumptions about the religion that for the most part also holds for any number of Christian sects.

&gt; Well, the exponential growth of people wearing the burka in my area. From zero 10 years ago. To dozens today. 

For starters, this is not statistically significant. Secondly, without taking into account patterns of how people *move*, this is entirely irrelevant. In other words: You're guessing, based on stereotyping and anecdotes. 

&gt; You wouldn't have seen bullshit like a poster saying music is forbidden in a school 2 decades ago

No, you wouldn't, since 2 decades ago, muslim schools were heavily discriminated against, and only Christian and Jewish schools received special treatment, and state schools were legally required to include christian collective prayer. Sounds like something fundamentalists would do to me.

&gt;  That's going to sink into those children's conscience, and some will surely take it to heart. Thereby increasing the fundie population further. 

It hasn't really worked out very well for the Christian groups that spend 5 decades trying to force Christian doctrine onto every schoolchild in Britain. Do you really believe Islam is so much more compelling to children?

Now, I'm against religious schools of all denominations. I consider religion in schools as tantamount to child abuse. But this idea that muslims are so much worse needs to die. It's just in the last couple of decades that the extensive christian discrimination against atheists and people other religious beliefs have started truly going away in most of Europe.

&gt;  France where Muslims who don't want to wear the headscarf are bullied and harassed.

Ah, yes, France, where Muslims who want to wear certain clothes face fines. That bastion of Christian and secular tolerance.

There are two things wrong with this. Firstly, the website you linked to looks to be maintained by a Muslim extremist who holds views that are in fact far placed from those of the average Muslim. I know this because I know many Muslims and so am able to pool an average opinion from which I have determined that they do not, in fact, unanimously prohibit western music (You too would probably come to this conclusion if you conducted fair research in to the opinions of Muslims instead of cherry picking links from a Google search). As human beings, not being oppressed by some cruel overlord, they're able to make their own decisions about which music they like and listen to just like everyone else.
Secondly, there exists no hierarchy in Islam. Therefore the opinion of one person can never be taken to align with the opinions of the majority of Muslims (unlike in the Catholic church where the Pope acts as such a representative). Each person is able to interpret their own faith in any which way they choose; some tolerate western music, some do not. And so it's futile to find examples of where someone has spoken out their 'Gospel' version of Islam in order to make a point about what Muslims do or do not tolerate.

So, bare in mind that these are just the musings of a tech/server chap who in no way has any knowledge of what goes on in senior management meetings where the future direction of the patient record is discussed.

As I understand it, that is how it was always originally due to the fact that the NHS was split into all its different Trusts, each with its own WAN/LAN meaning that all the data stored on each Trusts Clinical system was only accessible to other sites within the same Trust using the same configured software.

Over the last 7-8 years I think it is now there's been a big push to get all NHS Trusts using national systems (along with an enormous network provided by BT that I believe covers everywhere but that's not 100%)in order to get the single patient record, where I could be registered to my local Trust, go on holiday to London, break my leg and the Hospital I wander into there is able to pull up my record because both my originating Trust and the one I'm visiting all have access to the same data (albeit through different Software provided by different companies).

I personally don't know how big a percentage of the NHS Trusts have taken these systems live so not sure how effective it is but considering we were one of the 1st Trusts to go live with this 7-8 years ago, there should be a pretty high level of adoption by now.

I know some people will always have a bad time, hell I'm not even suprised that people are always crying unfair treatment incase they can try and sue the NHS but personally I've been in my local hospital twice for operations in the last 12 years and about 7-8x for other reasons and I've never had anything worse than a bit of a wait.",0,1397659818,null,0,false,0,cgtxbeu,t3_2348m1,t1_cgtxbeu,t1_cgtvgqa,null,1433380742,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The Christian ""problem groups"" are the evangelicals, not generally Catholics. 

E.g. the Catholic church has generally been ahead of the curve when it comes to acceptance of evolution amongst religious groups (Pope Pius XII confirmed in 1950 that Catholic doctrine was not *incompatible* with evolution, and the church have in recent years come out much stronger in favour of evolution).

I think you misunderstand the theory of capitalism. People invest money into companies with the aim of receiving dividends. If there are no dividends then there is no investment which means no company. The only reason any companies stop paying dividends is because they believe they have an investment opportunity that will generate even larger dividends further down the road.

&gt; By paying dividends while taking subsidy means the government is giving the company too much money.

No, our government is only giving the rail companies too much money if it could spend the same money in other ways to get an even better rail service, or if it could spend even less money in other ways and receive the same quality rail service.  Those are quite possibly true. However you do nothing whatsoever to demonstrate that either is the case.

The government is essentially buying a service (provision of rail transport for the public). So the main question should be - is it getting good value for the money it spends? Or could it save money by making a different buying decision (e.g. nationalisation).

*""As a team-mate it was one role; as a manager, another,"" says Moisés Hurtado, who played with Pochettino and then under him. ""As a player he had weight in the dressing room but as a manager there were later some attitudes that I didn't share. He wanted to control everything. The first season was fine: he'd been a player and he understood, he connected with us well. But then things changed. He seemed to see conspiracy where there was none and some good people had to leave out the back door, and not just players. He wanted everyone to dance to his tune, people entirely committed to him. The atmosphere ended up not being so good. In purely sporting terms, though, there was no problem: he got great results and we played well.""*

That was tied to him taking over from a player to a manager, but the decent into paranoia and belief that his was the only path forward fits with what i have seen mentioned before.  Do like the description of his training methods and meritocracy though.

Again, just not fully sold on him at the moment, not saying he isn't capable.",0,1397661026,null,0,false,0,cgtxv1u,t3_236bnw,t1_cgtxv1u,t1_cgtwq81,null,1433381066,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

It's simply that the new state-education paradigm is to let *anyone* run schools on a ""free market"" basis. 

This [originated under Blair and expanded under the tories.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_\(English_school\))  

Previously, for at least several decades, most state schools, if not all of them, have been controlled by local authorities.
  
Academy schools are freed from local government control, and will be assessed by OFSTEAD school inspectors like any other school. 

The idea is that head-teachers will be freer to experiment and drive success and won't be hampered by local council busybodies.

Schools can use alternative educational methods, such as [Montessori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montessori), and those that flourish will be rewarded because all the parents in the area will want to send their kids there (so the theory goes).

I don't really have an opinion on whether or not this will be successful - there certainly seem to have been some dodgy practices on the government's behalf establishing them, including allegations that inspectors were suddenly giving previously-successful schools failing grades so they could be forced into becoming academies (and thus their subsequent good grades could be used to show the success of the academies programme). I read about this happening under Labour, but it looks like it's [continuing under the present government, too](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=school+forced+to+become+academy).

My concern, when I read about the promotion of academies and this ""big society"" talk of allowing parents to take over and run their children's schools is that middle-class parent-govenors would give priority to their own kids, and discriminate against kids from the local council estate. You can be sure that stuff like that is going on, whilst the focus is on this muslim conspiracy.

true,Subotan,eng-lancashire,Lancashire,"&gt;My concern, when I read about the promotion of academies and this ""big society"" talk of allowing parents to take over and run their children's schools is that middle-class parent-govenors would give priority to their own kids, and discriminate against kids from the local council estate. You can be sure that stuff like that is going on, whilst the focus is on this muslim conspiracy. 

This is a potential problem with the way choice has been implemented in schools in the UK, but it's important to remember that class-based segregation in schools has occurred in every single public education system that has been employed in the UK. This is because class/income is the single strongest predictor for educational performance, and because of selection bias (i.e. being unable to observe counterfactuals of pupils' performances at schools they did not go to) what are to parents ""good schools"" are in reality schools with a higher proportion of middle class pupils. This wouldn't be a problem, but middle class families have the wealth to choose both between private and state education, as well as ""good"" and ""bad"" state schools through being able to move between catchment areas. In essence, the problem was that middle class families had choice whilst working class families did not.

So arguably, the solution to this is to design a school system in which choice is expanded and subsidised for poorer families. Voucher programmes in the States run on this kind of logic. My criticism of the Coalition's policy (which Labour and Hunt have implicitly supported) is that the State doesn't have big enough carrots to reward schools which have high degrees of integration, or big enough sticks to those which entrench the status quo. Were I a cynical man, I'd suggest that this is because the Government has realised that choice is electable insofar as it allows Mummy and Daddy to sit on the Board of Governors, run the raffle and secure a privileged education for their children, but that politically it's a disaster as soon as Timmy and Jessica have to sit in class with the proles from the Bell End Estate. I am a cynical man, for the record.

true,cocainesmoothie,null,null,"&gt; A sudden turn of pace and change of direction has became his trademark

That pretty much describes a very very big portion of Messi's game. I'm not saying Hazard will ever reach Messi's level but a lot of people here truly do believe he's going to win a Ballon D'or so..

How on earth does the #10 role burden a player. By definition it's the role that allows a player to be fully creative and drop into pockets of space to facilitate the attack. Are you implying that Hazard doesn't have the skill nor tatical nous to play this role? I'm predicting that Hazard will eventually move into the middle of the park in a couple of years. Whether it's with us or another them remains to be seen but he will be deadly once he's central.

Oscar is great, yes we've established this already. But he needs a Neymar, Hazard, Gotze etc. to play with him. Oscar isn't a player who can carry your team on a consistant basis.

Finally, you must've not watched Lavezzi play. He was dynamite while at Napoli and he's been good on a stacked PSG team fighting for minutes. What he could add to our team is crisp crosses since no one else on our team can do that and is great from set pieces as well. When was the last time you saw Willian whip in a corner that someone headed in? Also he's got a fantastic workrate which would fit right in at our team while still making direct penetrative runs. Again I don't want to see Oscar leave but if he does and Lavezzi and Cavani are coming back our way then so be it.

This is simply guidance from the Law Society to solicitors about what the normal traditions of Muslim wills are so they are more prepared to meet the needs of their clients.

If an agent is demanding you pay £3000 *now* (months before the tenancy) then I would be running away, that is not normal. You should pay the first months rent and the tenancy deposit at the same time you sign the tenancy agreement, which is done when the tenancy starts, as in on your move in day (or the few days before). Referencing fees and a holding deposit (a few hundred pounds) is normal to pay in advance, first months rent and deposit is not.

People put too much stock in having any credit history, if you're employed with a regular income of £20k+ with no outstanding debt and are on the electoral roll you won't have too much difficulty getting a small (~£2000) loan from a high street lender even if you've never borrowed before. That said, taking out a loan to pay tenancy costs is a god awful idea, it indicates that you're in a really bad financial position that you need to address as a priority. 

Side note, if your tenancy agreement ends in a couple of months why are you looking for a new place to live now? A landlord is not going to wait months for you to move in, agreeing to a tenancy more than a few weeks in advance is unlikely to be allowed by most agents/landlords. Also you don't *have* to move out at the end of a fixed term tenancy (unless your landlord has issued an S21?), it'll just revert to a periodic tenancy (assuming it's a standard AST) so if you can't afford to move, why move?

Nick Clegg 22% in UK parliment.

Also Nigel Farage has one job; to vote. whereas MIlliband Cameron and Clegg all have mush more overaching jobs.

http://www.reddit.com/r/brighton/comments/22n66q/what_are_peoples_general_opinions_of_the_mobile/

These are my initial opinions:

Generally, much better than O2 and GiffGaff for data speeds, O2 needs to step their game up. Very well priced with very fast 3G data speeds compared to other providers. They seem to be quite undersubscribed compared to other carriers so you can expect less people using it and thus better speeds.

EE, Tmobile and Orange all use the same masts and overall have better coverage however they are much more expensive than Three and are more oversubscribed - I was with T-Mobile for a couple of years and I never saw anything above 3Mbps download even in good coverage areas.

On Three, despite having 1 bar in my house in certain rooms, I can get 4Mbps - Much better than anyone else, same coverage as everyone else. I've yet to run any tests in better coverage areas but I expect it to be even better.

Three is a good balance between price and performance when it comes to mobile service, I would say go for it!

To see how good your coverage will be, the online coverage checkers for all providers are **complete lies** - For a good gauge to what speeds you will get look here: http://sitefinder.ofcom.org.uk/search - Click on masts nearby where you will use it and make sure there is a Three mast nearby, if for example you had Tmobile before and had good signal in your house and then saw on the map Three has a mast nearby Tmobile's mast you should expect similar signal. If the three masts aren't nearby where you use your phone don't expect the signal to be good.",0,1397666692,null,0,1397667462,0,cgu0m1v,t3_2366rq,t1_cgu0m1v,t3_2366rq,null,1433382362,1,false,brighton,t5_2qprp,1
