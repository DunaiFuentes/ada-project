Depending on what happens with Lukaku, we are probably finished buying, but we currently have too many players on our roster who are not home grown. Because of that we will see at least one foreign first team player leave before the window is done. In addition, a lot of the players who had loans last year will either be sold or loaned out again.

If rumors are to be believed expect to lose one of Torres, Lukaku, Mikel, or Cech (although I doubt it'll be Cech unless we get another crazy offer from PSG).

I think you can have it both ways without being hypocritical.  On one hand, I don't like players speaking out because it undermines the club's negotiation position.  Lovren was mad because there was a rumor that Southampton was being unrealistic about his price, but Schneiderlin is different.  He's being told that he won't be let go for any price.  Presumably he signed his contract under the impression that the club was committed to building for the future, and was told at the beginning of the summer that any transfer request would be honored.  

Now he's seen that the club has no ambition, and that transfer requests will not be honored starting...now (1 day after they cashed in on Chambers).

While ""treating them like people and teaching them to read"" is a good start, keep in mind that these children often come from very disadvantaged families and they tend not to receive the same support from home as non-Roma children. If a large share of a class is comprised of Roma children, they often end up reinforcing each other as a defence mechanism and try very hard to resist any attempts at integration. It takes an awful lot of work and talent to be able to genuinely help them. It doesn't help that areas with large Roma populations tend to be exactly those poor regions that young, competent professionals will want to avoid so there's a definite lack of available human resources who could tackle the situation as well.

Personally I believe that European attitudes towards Roma people are really shameful. We're talking about unbelievably impoverished people who often have nothing left but their dignity; these sorts of attitudes tend to take even that away from them.

If you have a £400 limit, that's more than likely their introductory card so the chances of them negotiating an extension on your limit are pretty low if at all. Just wait and they usually do it anyway as a matter of course.

The best option is to pay the balance in full each month. So long as you are meeting your minimum payments, then you are OK whatever you do.

They may be going on the fact that there is a regular update to the credit agencies (usually overnight) with regards the accounts. Really it makes no difference when you pay off.

Otherwise just hit up any bar in the town for a quiet pint.


Thursday: Tonnes of options on a Thursday night but it all depends on your taste.

2. You have the whole of the food court in Westfields (shopping centre) if you fancy some food. Alternatively there are quiet a few places to eat on the highstreet and gastro pubs.
3. If the kick off is 3pm get there for 2pm if you want to breath in the atmosphere abit. The players warm up and you can get a handshake from Jude the Cat if you are lucky. If you turn up SUPER early you can see the players entering the ground sometimes.

Etiquette wise. Don't cheer the opposition.... ever. For the game they are your mortal enemies to be hated. Don't wear the opposition colours. Don't block peoples view if you want to take pictures. Feel free to talk to people if you want.

You will hear swearing, probably some of the most colourful swearing you have ever heard... directed towards the pitch so be prepared. If you get talking to someone don't be afraid of your lack of knowledge, just don't pretend to know stuff about the club you don't or else you'll end up looking like a tit.

Lotfus Road is one of the few old old school stadiums left in the bigger leagues. You will be surprised how close you are to the players. I say enjoy it because it's near the end of it's life now.

EDIT: Elaborating on Capoue.. I mean to say when he was fit, we had him playing CB and not always as a defensive midfielder.. so he didn't really get a fair shake.  He was also injured for a while, iirc. 

Hmm, and we'll see what Poch and the team do re: Schneiderlin.  Maybe Poch thinks he is that important (as I'm leaning) or maybe he thinks it would be more of a luxury (as you do).  We'll see!  

Also, I kind of see Paulinho as more of an AM than someone who is that deep... he definitely is ok defensively, but I think he thrives further up the pitch... maybe we'll see a scenario with Eriksen out left, Paulinho behind the striker, and Lamela on the right.

While I agree wholeheartedly with the core-message, I have to wonder why the author is focussing on (what he thinks is) feminism. So far as I know MGM is a feminist issue, as it's am ill performed by (mostly) adult men on vulnerable infants.

I wonder that more resistance to the discussion is due to fear of being accused of anti-Semitism and secondly anti-Muslim. However, the GMC apparently won't discuss the issue but I can't see that that's likely due to any 'feminist' leanings - I can't say for certain on that subject, but there might be a case of ""nothing wrong with me"" in there (mentioned below). 

My own pet theory as to why there's a resistance against comparing FGM and MGM is that the latter is seen as somewhat 'normal'. While most men aren't cut in the UK, circumcision is a well known ""thing"", and generally it isn't widely known about what a baby suffers, and what a man loses, when the foreskin is removed for no medical need.

Due to that appearance of normalcy, any comparison of FGM to MGM is, I think, seen by many as an attempt to ""normalise"" FGM and bring it down from being a horrific practice to ""relatively harmless, like male circumcision"". For me, this is far from the case as I try to raise MGM to the same level as FGM. They are both practised for the same reasons (any argument made for one generally has a direct analogy for the other): neither has any medical benefit; both are performed without consent; both cause pain and suffering later in life; both remove the capacity for sexual pleasure; etc. However, pointing out that type IV FGM is not objectively 'worse' than the routine type of MGM often makes people think you're saying FGM isn't bad. Not true, and very frustrating.

As the author touched on too, there is also the issue that cut men are probably generally unlikely to want to admit that there's something less than perfect about their genitalia, and you'll find a large group of folk who brush off the issue with ""I'm cut and my penis works fine."" - Source: any discussion on circumcision with American men. That's one reason you get a perpetuation of the practice, and could be what's happening in the GMC? Depends how many older men are in there, and circumcision sympathisers.

**TL;DR** - Author is right but takes a strange line on the blame front.

But also not at all surprised that london has the lowest proportion living with parents. This is because of a few reasons:

1 - There is a huge abundance of jobs in London and if you are having trouble finding one, trust me you are not trying hard enough and/or over-rating yourself. I could easily just apply and get a retail job within a fortnight, it is that easy. Or spend a little bit more time getting a slightly higher paying job.

2 - The jobs usually pays quite a lot to be honest. From experience, most retail jobs even pays around £7.5-8 an hour if you get a job in zone 1-3 (most pay more I think), or 50p less if you work in zone 4-5ish area. Plus if you have experience or have a degree, that has the slightest of relevance, then you can easily get an Admin/office job that pays around £10-£15 an hour. 

3 - If you work full time you can more or less get by, albeit, if you spend conservatively also if you are good at finding cheaper renting places, then it will be a bonus. Most of the people I know live in zone 4-5 where the rent is cheaper and commute so they save a few hundred a month. However, the living condition are fairly cramped. Many share bedroooms to share rent.

4 - There is a huge number of immigrants and students who live out in London. Most of these people of course do not live with their parents (unless you were like me who commuted from home to study and work). Almost all of these people either study and work part-time if you are students (or full time study) or have full time job if you are an immigrant. Also these people are so much more likely to share houses so rent become much much cheaper and becomes affordable.


People make out London as one of the hardest places to live in due to the expensive prices, but to be honest in my opinion, it one of the easiest since it's so easy to get a job as long as you move your arse and just try. Other places, there is a lack of jobs and I'm sure it's genuinely difficult to find jobs, which is why it may be harder to move out.

So yea TL;DR - London population has a large proportion of students/immigrants who live out, easier to get a job, higher paying jobs, but many live in quite cramped places as they share houses for lower rent. All these things means you can move out quite easily.",0,1406661699,null,0,false,0,cjb9osz,t3_2c1pe0,t1_cjb9osz,t3_2c1pe0,null,1434960977,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Take a look at page 18 of the report. They essentially compare JSA/incap/ESA/pension to the ""target"" of 50% of the median income and say it's too low.

""The Committee also notes from the report that there are other types of benefits available, such as housing benefit. It asks whether it is available for single persons earning the minimum levels of short-term and long term incapacity benefits, state pension and job seeker’s allowance""

Maybe they should have asked someone who lives in the UK, because the answer is yes.. Pensioners especially will get full housing benefit, single working age adults get fucked a lot by our system but even they still get some housing benefit.

They completely neglect to count the other sources of income that a benefits claimant would have, such as housing benefit, tax credits, etc.

What the UK pays out each month/week in unemployment benefits is barely any different to what most mainland countries pay out. Germany pays out like 350 euros per month for their means tested unemployment benefit, slightly more than ours. 

It would be far better to compare our welfare systems to other European countries, as everything is relative. The ECSR thinks pretty much every European country is shit and isn't meeting the standards, so it's not really a good metric to measure how good or shit our welfare system is. 

Maybe the point they're trying to make is our actual unemployment benefits (incap, ESA, JSA) are pretty piss-poor and it's things like Child Tax Credits and unlimited HB for huge families that really breaks the bank and creates ""problem families"" but who knows.

Of course they fucking don't. They finished fifth for the first time in six years and what, they're going to buy the young ace from Chelsea with over a year left on his contract?

Give me a break. The transfer market has been absurd this summer with player prices going through the roof.

true,zcleg64,null,null,"The success of this season will come down to two little words: Europa League. Provided we get through both legs of the qualifier against FK AS Trencin, we'll have an extra 10 games before Christmas. Whether the squad is deep enough to deal with that extra workload remains to be seen, and for all the good work that Steve Bruce has done over the past couple of years, he's never managed in a European competition. We could very easily go the way of Swansea last season, and sink dangerously close to the bottom of the table. Having said that, I'm optimistic about both Europe and the Premier League. We're not going to be title contenders, that's for sure, but I'm almost certain that we'll be better than at least three other teams come the end of the season. 

Tactics: Bruce made use of three centre backs quite a lot last season, and he's indicated that he'll do it again this season. Three at the back gives defensive solidity whilst allowing Elmohamady and Brady (if fit!) to bomb down the wings, Huddlestone to play his ""quarterback"" role in midfield.  We've also been known to play 4-4-2 (though it never seems to work quite as well in my opinion). 

Possible Starting XI (apologies for terrible formatting)

                   McGregor 
            Chester - Bruce - Davies
Elmohamady                             Brady
      Snodgrass - Huddlestone - Livermore

Players to watch:

Tom Huddlestone 
Not the most graceful of midfielders, but on his day can pass the ball like  nobody's business. Can really dictate games when sitting in the hole just in front of the defence. 

Robbie Brady
Had a storming first half of last season before injury brought him down. It'll be interesting to see if he replicates last year's early-season form this year. He's certainly got the talent.

Tom Ince
I've never really been convinced by him, and he didn't make too much of an impact at Crystal Palace, so this season could be make-or-break for his career as a whole. Really interesting to see what'll happen.

I realise that FGM affects women's sexual health far more, but your points stands just as much for men and male circumcision.

Your first point on pleasure it really subjective. I've talked about this topic to people who converted to Islam as adults. Their only comment was that it was the same but their tool felt ""tighter"" in the beginning. However two compare male circumcision and FGM is insane. If you have a strong stomach you should look up FGM.  It's not a pleasant read.

&gt; Most medical procedures are performed because they are either preventative or curative: they enhance the person's health, in the short run or the long run, and that is why they are necessary. If someone dies, at least you were trying to improve their health. Since this child circumcision is neither preventative nor curative, I question its necessity and its status as a ""medical procedure"", and thus whether any child should be dying from it at all.

It's a religious requirement. If you are a muslim or a jewish man you have to have it. I don't know how many people outside of those two communities do it but for us it is a must.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Hey mate,

Good work breaking free from the 'employee' bullshit.

Setting up a company account is a bit of a ballache and will take you a bit of time. I went with HSBC years ago, it involved rocking up with my company registration cert and a bunch of proof of identify. You sign a billion sheets (avoid getting a credit card and debit card, they usually cost you a service fee after your initially period). Once that is finished you'll receive everything in post. It's possible to setup within a week - you probably wont need those details until you submit your first invoice but various agents/companies differ.

You *will* need to register for VAT. You can do this yourself fairly easily but it's something your accountant should do for you. If you're earning 310 a day, get an accountant (at least initially). 

The real need for an accountant comes with the new Payroll system. ""RTI"". In short, a directory needs to ""clock his hours"" and submit real-time information to HMRC. You need to do this; I can't remember if the fines are in place yet but none the less do it.

My recommended accountants are Crunch IT (cheapish) or meadescontractors (expensive). Where you can make sure you they do your end of year accounts for free. You'd also benefit from your personal end of year being filed on your behalf (though you have to provide all your personal accounts which is a pain). What out for bullshit fees such as RTI filing expenses, annual return costs, personal return costs etc

Don't do what lots of fuckwit contractors do initially and spend the cash you see. It isn't yours, it's illegal to spend more (put your company into debt) than your liabilities without an ability repay. At 310/day you'll bill 310 + 20% VAT (£372/day or £7440 month). I'll assume you'll be on flat rate so you get a certain % of that VAT bill back each year. At that rate I wouldn't take more than £3k per month (ideally 12k per quarter) - that'll give you some breathing room should an unexpected bill arise

My rambling aside, you'll likely take a ""salary"" which accounts for at least your free personal tax allowance per year (630~ year iirc). After than number, you can take dividends which you will pay a percentage of tax on that will be repaid at the end of the next financial year (see personal tax return)

Hopefully that helps, best of luck",0,1406664505,null,0,false,0,cjbbcgp,t3_2c2394,t1_cjbbcgp,t3_2c2394,null,1434961758,4,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,4

[Capoue v Scheniderlin](http://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/article9018749.ece/alternates/w620/MSvsEC.JPG)

Unfair comparison cuz of the lack of games for Etienne, different caliber of team/system and he was at new club too and we didn't' really have a ''system''. If he can do that, imagine what he can do under Poch. Looking at their average positions they cover both sides of that central midfield and I know it's a bit *too* defensive - but imagine them two with Eriksen, Holtby, Lamela, Soldado etc running riot up front in a 4-2-3-1 with the wing backs bombing forwards. Capoue is decent as a CB too, and can drop back if Vlad/Vertonghen make a run from CB. Same as Schneidlierinrjin (lol), who dropped back between the CB's in Poch's system.

at the beginning of last season, i was more excited about Capoue than any of the other new signings (except Eriksen of course). he was an absolute mountain in those first few games; i may have the benefit of hindsight but seeing him lumbering around in front of the back four and breaking up everything in sight was such a welcome change. i was gutted that he was hurt for the majority of the season, and out of favor with Tim when he was fit. i love Sandro, obviously, but i'd like to see Capoue get a few run-outs under Poch because he looked quite menacing in the first few starts last fall. the Beast will always be in my heart but it may be time for a changing of the guard, because this dude looks like he could be  a real prospect ",0,1406665688,null,0,false,0,cjbc1ks,t3_2c2lsi,t1_cjbc1ks,t1_cjbaxaq,null,1434962153,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

But only scored 5 goals. 

5 goals in 40 appearances?! That's rubbish! But if that striker only ever came on as a sub for the last 15 minutes of those 40 games, then it looks rather different. So, to save time - and a long and tedious exchange of posts on internet message boards - it is a handy and fairer measure if that number of goals is measured vs actual games started. Which is clearly giving that player a bit longer on the pitch in order to score a goal.

Which is why goals scored and games started is a generally accepted, level playing field comparative metric.

Of course, one could look at 'minutes played' as well, but most normal fans can't be arsed and instead happily adopt the methodology I used, because that makes more sense and is a more readily comparable statistic.

true,MadArend,num20,,"There's a serious problem with the comparison graphic.  Some if not all of the statistics are incorrect. 

Capoue made 12 appearances, not 6.  He also scored a goal against City.  Maybe that graphic is from the middle of the season, but whatever the case may be, it's not reliable.

EDIT: Here are the current stats, according to Whoscored:

* Appearances:  Schneiderlin 31(2); Capoue 8(4)
* Goals/Assists: Schneiderlin 2/1; Capoue 1/0
* Pass Accuracy: Schneiderlin 89.3%; Capoue 84.2%
* Tackles per game: Schneiderlin 3.4; Capoue 2.1
* Interceptions per game: Schneiderlin 2.1; Capoue 2.5
* Rating: Schneiderlin 7.2; Capoue 6.89

Interestingly, not massively different from the original graphic you posted, even though the original graphic was based on the part of the season when we *did* have a system (AVB's) and we had the best defense in the league.  So Capoue's statistics actually didn't drop off all that much even when he struggled with fitness and Sherwood turned the team into a defensive shambles.",0,1406666381,null,0,1406667699,0,cjbcfzb,t3_2c2lsi,t1_cjbcfzb,t1_cjbbhgd,null,1434962342,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

I have ran afoul of employers before they ever meet me even with a prestigious degree because I don't have technical experience even for graduate/entry positions. It's frustrating but actually benefits people with technical skills like yourself rather than enthusiastic amateurs like myself who dabbled in professional skills in voluntary positions or as part of a university society.

Strax, for example, is like a very sweet caramel. His ""wacky"" blunders about misunderstanding gender and loving grenades is tolerable as a minor character in a sparse handful of episodes. You would not want a four-course meal with a bowl of caramel in *every single dish*.

There are a couple popular spin-off ideas, lemme list a few off:

**The Last Centurion**  
Show would follow Rory during his Roman days. A slightly historical bent as we see Rory live through important periods of history and fend off foes both human and alien alike from the incredible power of the Pandorica.

**The Doctor's Daughter**  
Show would follow the Doctor's clone Jenny as she attempts to emulate the Doctor's many adventures, hitchhiking across the universe looking for people to help and monsters to fight. 

**UNIT Spinoff**  
Show would follow Kate Stewart, Osgood, and the rest of UNIT's crack team of extraterrestrial investigation agents on their duty to protect Earth from the dangers of extraterrestrial incursion.

**Metacrisis Spinoff**  
Show would follow Metacrisis Doctor and Rose Tyler as they head the Alternate Reality Torchwood. Just as the Cybermen took a different form, the Doctor and Rose will face many different alterations of the Doctor's usual foes alongside new faces both human and alien.

I think my main point, though, is that Rodriguez really isn't a project.  We really don't need him to develop - obviously you want any player to improve but he isn't ""one for the future.""  If he is precisely as productive for us as he was for Southampton, and never gets any better over the course of his entire career, he would still represent excellent value.  I know there's more to the game than goals but we would be *ecstatic* to get 15 goals from a left forward or winger and pretty happy to get 10.  This is a 25-year-old with two years in the Premiership coming off a 17-goal season and you're talking about him like he'd be another Harry Kane or Andros Townsend.

Rodriguez isn't a project, he's a full-fledged senior player.

* On average, there are two persons in each household in ~~Chicago~~ Bristol.
* Roughly one household in twenty has a piano that is tuned regularly.
* Pianos that are tuned regularly are tuned on average about once per year.
* It takes a piano tuner about two hours to tune a piano, including travel time.
* Each piano tuner works eight hours in a day, five days in a week, and 50 weeks in a year.

From these assumptions, we can compute that the number of piano tunings in a single year in ~~Chicago~~ Bristol is:

    (428,100 persons in Bristol) / (2 persons/household) × (1 piano/20 households) × (1 piano tuning per piano per year) = 10702.5 piano tunings per year in Bristol.

We can similarly calculate that the average piano tuner performs:

    (50 weeks/year)×(5 days/week)×(8 hours/day)/(2 hours to tune a piano) = 1000 piano tunings per year per piano tuner.

Dividing gives:

    (10702.5 piano tunings per year in Bristol) / (1000 piano tunings per year per piano tuner) = 11 piano tuners in Bristol (rounding up).

* what hair style I had
* whether I got tanned at an early age

2) The blame for Palestinian deaths is entirely on Hamas who has chosen to go to war with Israel. Hamas deliberately chose to fire rockets and tunnel into Israel  from within heavily populated areas instead of farmland of which Gaza has plenty. Israel has to fight them there. 

3) Arab Muslims could not give a shit about hundreds of thousands of innocent Arabs Muslims killed by other Arab Muslims, like in Iraq or Syria

Take 20% of the leftovers (minimum) and assume they will go on bills that you need to pay throughout the year. Then divide what's left by the number of weeks at uni per year. You can figure out how much you want/need to spend on the various different areas of your life.

You say you have no intention of becoming massively frugal, but that **is** a part of the student experience. Try the alternatives in the supermarket, shop around for a cheaper phone contract when yours expires, and have a scavenger hunt with your friends to find the cheapest place for a night out.

Still, if you talk to the person behind the bar about beer, and they're into beer themselves, they'll probably start offering you tasters. Sadly some of my colleagues are not beer drinkers and don't understand the culture.

Look out for pubs advertising 'real ales', CAMRA awards, and generally [pumps that look like this](http://imgc.allpostersimages.com/images/P-473-488-90/58/5858/R5KSG00Z/posters/steve-vidler-england-london-beer-pump-handles-at-the-bar-inside-tradional-pub.jpg), if they've got a few of those, you're hopefully in a good pub.

Bath's in my local area, so from the top of my head I'll personally recommend these West Country Beers:

* Arbor Ales &lt;- Excellent beers, in a modern and hoppy style like that of American craft beer. They also do some serious dark ales.
* St Austell Brewery &lt;- Commonly available, and for the right reasons. You'll probably prefer the hoppy 'Proper Job', but Tribute is a good representation of the style of beer most popular in the British craft scene. HSD is a maltier Bitter, with a well deserved reputation.
* Cheddar Ales &lt;- Potholer is a popular golden ale, but sadly I don't get to try their others very often.
* Milk Street Brewery &lt;- Plenty of quirky beers to keep an eye out for with more novel flavours.
* Butcombe &lt;- Be careful how you say it, it's somewhere between 'But-Cum' and 'But-Com', so go with the latter. Gold, Brunel IPA, and Rare Breed are good. Haka is my favorite; a deliciously hoppy beer with a lower A.B.V. I don't rate their ordinary Butcombe bitter, but many people do.
* Hopback Brewery &lt;- Summer Lightning is one of the beers that started the trend for lighter coloured hoppier beers, and it is fantastic to this day.

Beers from outside the region I'm always asked for include London Pride, and Timothy Taylor's Landlord. They're like Tribute and Potholer in having both hoppy and malty characters, but neither being particularly strong. They're what I would consider 'balanced'.

Regarding fullbacks it's just a complete tossup.  Robinson/Kelly could come out of nowhere like Flanno did last season or Enrique/Johnson could find their top form again which makes spending on a big name fullback a bit surplus to requirements.

Why do you think Capoue has more potential than Schneiderlin?  I haven't watched Schneiderlin consistently, so I'm just going on piecemeal information, but I don't see much separating them in basic ability, to be honest. Capoue intercepts more, whereas Schneiderlin tackles more, but otherwise they have very similar skillsets.  Schneiderlin is two years younger, though.

Also, Capoue's huge rating at Toulouse was skewed by his offensive output, which I can't see him replicating in the PL.

And although Sandro was much weaker last season, he was not fully fit either.  If he's fully healthy and can regain his confidence, he might recapture his pre-injury form -- which was better than both Capoue and Schneiderlin.

It's also not feasible to design a general anti-avoidance law; the current government commissioned an independent study group to look at doing just that[1] which came to the conclusion that a law could only focus on very limited number of avoidance schemes which were clearly abusive without having unreasonable side-effects (i.e people having no idea if they were within the law or not).

It was safer for me and everyone else. I'm equally ecstatic at the decision made by every other parent who decides to immunise their child. But that's a decision that cannot be made later on in life and has outstanding benefits to it. Not quite the same as circumcision.

On the list you have, quite a few more of those are unavoidable decisions that have to be made whilst the child is still a child (school, hair style(?), food). Others, I'm not so sure that they made decisions about. 

Do parents really choose their child's friends? Or whether they're sporty? Did your father *really* make a decision whether to drop you on you head? As in he consciously thought it through? (If so, it would be pretty alarming)

The healthy and smokers points kinda fall under the same umbrella of good parenting. Keep the child as healthy as possible, so the kids should probably be around smoking as little as possible. Besides, I'm not quite sure what the alternative to that is. Bringing the child up unhealthily? I'm not sure any sane parent consciously makes a decision to bring their kid up unhealthy. 

Anyway, I don't really see how any of those points are comparable to infant circumcision, as in none of those are life-long effecting and have no *real* benefits to them. The only benefit you've given me is that you like the look of it, but couldn't you have got it done as an adult? 

I think I've covered everything I want to say, so I'll just summarise my view, which is that there is absolutely no need for circumcision to be done at birth.

I would love to see that comparison between a fully fit Capoue playing every game AT DM vs Schneiderlin in the season before. While Capoue was dominating Lige 1 Morgan was decent in the Championship and his first EPL season at Southampton. Capoue was often put as a CB for us, and played less than double digit matches. Do you think Morgan would excel the same as a CB, as Capoue often was shifted into for us? Capoue is also a man mountain in comparison, nearly 4 inches taller and more muscle on him. He won over 3/4 of his Aerial duels. He was known as the most ''intimidating'' DM in French Football size wise. 

Plus he's just as comfortable on the ball at his feet with equal passing. *Capoue’s main strength lies in passing. He is very adept in playing through balls and long passes. Last season, he made 2171 passes in the entire season, out of which 373 were long passes attempted. Dembele, who is arguably more creative than others in Spurs midfield, attempted only 108 long balls.*

I would rather have a fully fit Capoue with Sandro and put the 15-20m fee towards a LW and CB, if I'm being honest. Lets NOT forget, [Capoue was linked to some MASSIVE clubs.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2171304/Arsenal-rival-Barcelona-Toulouse-midfielder-Etienne-Capoue.html). Regularly, too. He was in the [Lige 1 team of the year](http://www.unfp.org/a-la-une/article/le-palmares-complet-14052012-6476.html) and L'Équipe constantly gave Capoue the highest ratings as a DM.

true,Messisfoot,null,null,"Yeah... actually Capoue was looking pretty decent as well against Arsenal. The only reason they scored that one goal was because Dawson failed to stop Giroud. He got injured that game and never really came back until Tactics Tim came in. It was not so much that Tim didn't like Capoue, but more that Tim didn't like CDMs. And it was kinda funny that a manager with no previous top flight experience or coaching badges was going to tell the rest of the managerial world some sort of strategic secret he had found out. In the end, our team shipped more goals because the lack of the CDM. Sure, we played Sandro there, but we were playing 4-4-2 were everyone but the strikers had to track back and defend (wasting Eriksen's and his BFF Bentaleb's potential). When Tim finally realized that he was a first time top flight manager with no previous experience, and realized that there were advantages to a CDM, our team played better. With Capoue or Sandro as our CDMs, Bentaleb was able to create more for the Newcastle game instead of having to try to be a CDM.

Now as far as Paulinho and Dembele in CDM is just plain nuts. Both of them are attack minded, as AVB discovered when the midfield was being overrun by our team and causing the team to stack up in their box, leading to Soldado not being able to do anything. The truth is, we have two CDMs, Sandro and Capoue. When Capoue is on his game, he can be just as good as Sandro. Paulinho and Dembele are better as box-to-box midfielders. They can defend, but making them pure CDMs is a waste of their potential as well as a liability given their tendency to drive forward.",0,1406675843,null,0,false,0,cjbhfr4,t3_2c2lsi,t1_cjbhfr4,t3_2c2lsi,null,1434964698,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

It's true universities like Oxford are well regarded for pretty much everything, but apart from these few, most universities have stronger and weaker subject areas, and people in those areas are well aware of this.

Everyone is going on about us needing a LW, but I can see the starting 3 behind the striker being Eriksen/Holtby/Lamella, as that almost exactly mirrors what Pochettino had with Rodriguez/Davis/Lallana. Then you have Chadli/Townsend and Lennon rotating in for injuries/resting players.

When you look at our defense we seem to have fixed our fullback issue, but Dawson (despite reading the game well) is too slow, Kaboul is far from the player he was a couple of seasons ago, and Chirches in my opinion isn't the right player to pair with Vertonghen (too similar and he still hasn't sold me that he is dependable enough mentally) 

While I like the fact that we are known historically as an exciting attacking team, I'd really like to see us bolster that defense. We have arguably the best keeper in the league, put a really solid defense in front of him, and with the attacking players we have already I doubt you'd see us worrying about scraping into the top 4 come the end of the season.

That seems like having your cake and eating it, if you don't mind me saying so. You are simply selecting the evidence that suits your views. 

You also quite wrongly state that circumcision has no medical rationale. It is well established that circumcision helps hygiene and reduces the risk of STIs.

However, to put male circumcision in the same class as FGM is, to my mind, a rather hysterical position that requires one to disregard important and obvious differences in the rationale and long-term effects of what are quite different practices.

true,Chimpville,null,null,"Haha, you have the temperament of an officer. Good luck to you.

The point wasn't missed, I'm saying that the examples you used were poor and a little unfair. Let's put this issue to bed and I'll just freely accept that the RM are an excellent force with a lot of flexibility. Saying that the Army couldn't operate without them isn't really correct however. The RM operate as a very large light infantry organisation specialising in amphibious operations. in the post-war era it became increasingly clear that there were a lot of limitations to a predominantly amphibious force so there were at the time motions to scale them back and drop much of the commando element. Luckily it was seen that this would be a huge waste of a proud and prestigious organisation that was staffed by excellent individuals and practices so they were able to reinvent themselves. The duties you mentioned before reference jungle, arctic warfare and support to SF were to be taken on by specific troops within the Light Infantry organisations (they still have amphib commando and airborne troops now). To reclaim their relevance the RM devised their training to take on these roles. So while the RM make up the bulk of this capability, the fact that they're in existence is the reason the Light Infantry weren't expanded to perform them.

In short; the RM are an extremely skilled, exceptional force that make up the bulk of our capability when it comes to war fighting up to a certain scale (before heavy armour, heavy artillery, specialised trades are required). If the RM weren't around or had been scaled back as planned, their roles would have been fulfilled in their entirety by LI, barring amphibious operations. What effect this would have had on the quality of the forces or operations is anybody's guess. Personally I'm glad to have them.

Edit: The reinvention of the RM was explained brilliantly in a book I stole from when I worked near Lympstone... I can't remember the author or the specific personalities though I'm afraid.

Schneiderlin is an extremely high quality player that is familiar with and excelled within Poch's side.  Sandro is oft injured, and while I love the guy, he's never going to be more valuable than he is at the moment, especially if he gets hurt yet again.

I would be sad to see them sell Paulinho, though I am worried about him.  His confidence seems to have completely dissolved both from seeing his form at the end of last season and then again for Brazil.  I would love to see him come good again though and be a force for us.  He's the opposite of Sandro-- we'd be selling for a major loss if we did at the moment, because he has had such a bad year internationally and in the league.

Rodriguez wouldn't hurt to have if he came along as part of the package, but I certainly wouldn't be sad to not get him.

true,MadArend,num20,,"Fair point that Capoue played at CB for three games (25% of his appearances) last season, which skews his stat &amp; ratings, amongst other issues, because he was awful at CB.  Besides the Liverpool debacle, I also recall the game against Anzhi when he and Fryers were paired at the back, and Fryers was clearly the better CB of the two, particularly in the air.

Of course, there is no shame in being a poor CB when one is not actually a CB.  And Capoue clearly isn't, and I certainly wouldn't want to see him or Schneiderlin manning the back for us at any time.

How would Schneiderlin fare as a fill-in CB?  I don't know, and it doesn't matter.  That is not why we'd buy him, and if either he or Capoue get any games at CB, then we're probably in serious trouble.

So you've given your views on Capoue's strengths, but you still haven't said how you think they compare to Schneiderlin's, other than the fact that Capoue is taller (though Schneiderlin is supposedly strong in the air, too, though I have no stats on that like the one you have for Capoue in the French league).  

Capoue passes a lot.  OK, but last season those passes didn't seem to accomplish very much.  Do you think Capoue is a better passer than Schneiderlin?  Because I keep hearing that Schneiderlin is an excellent passer (and his stats clearly back that up, at least for last season - higher accuracy, 3x as many key passes, more passes per game, and more long balls).

AND IIRC, Capoue joined August 15th? So had ZERO pre-season to boot. Thrown in at the deep end royally with a group of new players all on different pages, languages and styles. But like I said, it's easy to compare ''last season'' like you've said below when you consider my above points. Plus, it's easy to buy into the hype (Morgan is FANTASTIC) comparing him to Capoue, when Capoue is basically a forgotten man at this point - if that makes sense? 

&gt;OK, but last season those passes didn't seem to accomplish very much

&gt;(and his stats clearly back that up, at least for last season - higher accuracy, 3x as many key passes)

Here's a fact about Capoue, playing a full season fit in his preferred role at a team he wasn't ''new'' too and had played for his whole career. 

&gt;Last season, (Capoue at Toulouse before he joined) he made 2171 passes in the entire season, out of which 373 were long passes attempted. Dembele, who is arguably more creative than others in Spurs midfield, attempted only 108 long balls.


&gt;Capoue had over 90% pass completion rate in the French league last year, won more 50/50 balls than anyone and from what I have heard he was the most feared and most intimidating footballer in France.[source 1](http://www.ja606.co.uk/articles/viewArticle/226667) [source 2](http://eplindex.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Etienne-Capoue-Defensive-Contribution.png) [source 3](http://eplindex.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Etienne-Capoue-Passing-Breakdown.png) 


&gt; Of all players to make at least 15 appearances in defensive midfield in Ligue 1, Etienne Capoue was dribbled past the fewest times per game (0.43)

and one for Spurs - 

&gt;In a 33 minute cameo vs Palace, Capoue made more interceptions than West Ham, West Brom and Sunderland did as a WHOLE TEAM combined in 90 minutes. That's INSANE.

It's a good problem to have, isn't it? I would happily move on Paulinho in a flash, Lennon and any other dead wood and have both of these players in our team. If you look at their heatmaps, they cover pretty much opposite sides over the entire CM. Imagine the front 4 running riot with these 2 in a pair. Capoue being a man mountain with excellent feet, and Morgan equally as good defensively but not as imposing.

As I've said in other threads, the Ministers' claims of sanctions being a last resort don't really connect with over a million sanctions in the last 12 months when there's only 2.5 million claimants.  40% doesn't sound like last resort actions.

I sense I wasn't sanctioned because I did my research and followed all rules to the letter, and didn't have an advisor looking for easy targets.

I can only recommend getting the news out about this site and service to more people.

Tuesday, log in, find about 12 new jobs, none of which are relevant, 10 mins later, move on to next site, find one thing, apply, 10 mins later, next site, next site...out of ideas.

Wed, log in...nothing relevant and new, dammit, log in to give other job sites, find one lousy job that might have potential. it's now nearly 10am and I've not even spent an hour on jobsearch and somehow I'm supposed to spend seven hours a day on this.

Also, it might look lazy, but I'm just not going to apply for a job under 16 hours a week, as I'll still have to do all the bullshit connected with JSA, combined with holding down a job, and then having to prove my earnings each week on top of that, giving them even more opportunities to screw up my claim and leave me with nothing.

true,MadArend,num20,,"I agree on Paulinho.  And I could definitely see Schneiderlin playing in a double-pivot alongside a CDM, which is why I could see us bringing him in but also keeping Capoue and Sandro.

By the way, I was never asking about Capoue doing better in the future than Schneiderlin did this past season.  This was always about who had the bigger upside going forward -- as you put it, whether or not ""he can be the better player,"" or as I put it, whether ""Capoue has more potential than Schneiderlin"" ...  If you meant that Capoue can do better *in the future* than Schneiderlin *already has*, then you should give some consideration to being clearer in how you articulate.  I say this as constructive criticism because you have expressed a desire to get into professional scouting (which involves lots of writing).

You still haven't shown why Capoue *will be better* than Schneiderlin *will be*, but that may not have been your intent.  I will say that comparing their relative futures is the only comparison that matters if we're debating which one we should start at CDM.  However, if it's about whether Capoue should start *alongside* Schneiderlin (as you suggest in your last paragraph, and as I have suggested elsewhere), then it's not about comparing them as much as it is about what the two of them combined can bring to the table.

true,notnotcitricsquid,null,null,"The amount you need for an emergency fund is very personal and depends entirely on the circumstances you're in. If you're someone who has a volatile job with variable earnings it can often be mindful to have a 12 month emergency fund, if you're someone in a secure job that can expect to die in that job then a 3 month emergency fund can be more than enough! Personally I would never be comfortable with less than 6 months, but for people on a low income 6 months can often be impossible.

If you're earning £1200 a month and spending £1000 per month while living at home you're going to need to take a good hard look at your spending and decide if you're financially ready to take responsibility for all of your living costs, if you want to rent and continue to save £200 per month you're going to have to reign in your spending a lot. As a brief overview of the costs you can expect: £420 rent, £80 council tax, £30 electricity, £15 gas, £15 water, £200 food, £10 contents insurance, £25 broadband/phone, £20 TV, £10 TV License... that's ~£800 per month just to pay your essential household bills. Do you have any debts? Travel expenses? Do you go out?

At the start of a tenancy you'll need the first months rent, plus a deposit (normally equal to 4 or 6 weeks rent) plus money for fees: you're looking at £1000 - £1200 to start a tenancy.

I moved out the first moment I could when I was 19 years old and although the freedom is amazing (and the personal growth people experience living alone is great too) it's **very expensive** and it's so very difficult to truly understand the value of free (or cheap) living with parents until you've moved out, at which point it becomes very apparent what an incredible financial opportunity it is to be able to live with parents. That said not everything is about finances, sometimes moving out is important even if it comes at a large financial cost, you just have to make sure you're ready for. I would recommend in your situation (low income, never moved out before) that you aim for at least a 3 month emergency fund and spend the next 6 months hyper-focused on improving your savings and reducing your expenditure. If you can only save £200 per month while living with parents (unless they're charging you £400/m rent!) you have a lot of room to improve, and if you can get your savings up to say £500/month you'll be able to move out even sooner :)

The major thing to remember is that when you are responsible for your own living costs there are constantly surprise expenses, for every £1 you expect to spend you'll probably spend £1.30. For example last month I moved and I was surprised by an underpaid electricity bill, I had to pay £300! That sort of thing is very common and the hardest part of living alone, it takes real care and attention to keep on top of everything to the point that you never have a surprise bill, which is very hard when you're new to living alone.

true,RDandersen,null,null,"Alright, better answer? The last many years, he's almost exclusively done historic, documentary stuff on TV. Not *actually* exclusively, but it's pretty clear that it's what he enjoys. A panel show does not quite fit into that pocket, and that would give him a reason to decline.  

Secondly, a tonne of past or present comedians and personalities (there's, like, a lot of them) in Britain with equal or greater notoriety and wit who have not been on the show either. Some people just don't do panel shows because it doesn't fit their brand, because they don't like the style, because they are afraid to work unscripted, because of booking. Another couple of reasons to decline an invitation.  

Thirdly, the unfun one, maybe he hasn't been invited because a producer or Fry or someone else with pull on the show, someone who knows Mr. Robinson better than you and I do, feels like he wouldn't be a good fit for the show. Maybe there was a falling out? We don't know.  
Essentially, any of the reasons I gave for Tony declining could be turned around as a reason for an invitation to not be sent in the first place.  

So why did I make such a silly, first comment? Because I think the title was kind of silly. ""Why has X not been a panelist"" warrants, in my opinions, no better reply than the one I gave.  
You weren't really asking that question, though, were you? I'm guessing that you were really just trying to say ""I feel like Tony Robinson would be an excellent panelist"" which makes so much more sense as a title.  

If you will allow me to delve into semantics for a second.  
The first title, the one you used, calls for either fruitless speculation or for someone to provide you with what a simple Google search could give you much easier. I'm not implying that this was your intent, but that is, nonetheless, how it comes off when I read it.  
The second title, the one I suggested, calls for a discussions about the merits of a comedic actor turned historical documentary host on a comedy panel show which frequently features historical content.  

I know it's probably just me who sees this; I realize that my pet peeves aren't everyone else's, but sometimes I just have to let it out regardless.

1. Merlin is to return from Avalon when he is cured of his mortal wounds. Basically, his wounds were fatal, so he is in Avalon letting them heal.

2. The hand SHOULD be that of The Lady of the Lake, Ruler of Avalon. Pretty sure it was Arthur's arm, though. That being said, the arm that provided the sword to Merlin in time of need was meant to seem like Freya's arm, but I am going to guess that it was Arthur's arm. I assume that once Arthur passed through to Avalon, time got Wibbly-Wobbly for him and he was able to do some non-linear sight-seeing.   CORRECTION: Freya apparently became The Lady of the Lake, so that works out. I still think it's a dude's arm, though.

3. Because that would be the obvious answer and Arthur's mortal wound is inevitable, being that it is his destiny. Basically, plot.

4. I think the dragon was already old. I think he was just being a grumpy asshole when he refused to be summoned.

5. For this one, I mostly agree with what you've said, but if you'd like to read more of his return, there's a [wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Arthur%27s_messianic_return) for that.

&gt;

&gt;__King Arthur's messianic return__ is an aspect of the legend of [King Arthur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Arthur), the mythical 6th-century British king. Few historical records of Arthur remain, and there are doubts that he ever existed, but he achieved a [mythological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythology) stature that gave rise to a growing literature about his life and deeds. One recurrent aspect of Arthurian literature was the notion that he would one day return in the role of a [messiah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah) to save his people.

&gt;&gt; Rose: wasn't she at some point the Tardis? Not her as ""Rose"" in that one finale where she was the Bad Wolf, but an earlier episode I think??? (Like how Clara was a Dalek, and then wasn't, but I think that's because she jumped in the time lighties in Name of the Doctor and got scattered?).

&gt; No, never. She had the time vortex infused into her, which was what made her Bad Wolf.

Yes I remember that, but there was a totally different story when Matt/11 or one of them had a flashback to when he first stole the Tardis, and was in a desert-looking area, wondering what to do (it was sorta very humourous!). It was one of the first episodes I ever watched and I've recently seen it again, so I'd *guess* S7. The Doctor wasn't sure what he *should* be doing, or what he was doing (dang I *really* think it was Matt S playing the role!!), and he stepped in some *frame* and was hanging around, then **Rose** freaking popped up and asked all these questions, and she turned out to be the heart of the Tardis or something and that's how ""he got the power"" or the know-how to use the Tardis.

Okay, *I never got (understood) that.* And when I got to S1, I screamed and said ""SHE'S THE TARDIS!"" but she was Rose, so I thought she'd had a memory wipe. Anyway, it was pretty neat. I wonder if it were a special? BBC doesn't seem to run those ""regularly"" (in order) so I have no idea. (Not a webisode though; I see all my Who on BBC except *yesterday*, when I watched the 6 minute one with Hurt in it!)

&gt;&gt; Is Clara is ALL the companions? Is that what the Impossible Girl means?

&gt; No she wasn't. Multiple versions of her appeared throughout time; this was what made her impossible.

OMG thank you so much; my brain was *scrambled* on that (especially when there were multiple companions in an episode, which is *always* a nice surprise for me. I hope we see more of that in fact :) Now I need to wrap my mind around *just* Clara=Impossible Girl, because ALL ALONG NOW I've been thinking all the companions were ""the Impossible Girl""/Clara. Yes, I'm going to have to rewatched it all AGAIN! (But I don't mind... except no more weeping angels ones. I *detest* those.) At least Clara's got plenty of story coming up, so WHEW!

&gt; ...eh? Matt's the Eleventh Doctor and he was buried in Trenzalore, but the Time Lords changed the timeline and gave him a new regeneration cycle.

Lost again! LOL! Okay so wait: when they regenerate, is ...*something left behind?* Or is it like how *a version* of the Doctor (like 10) can break out into another universe and hook up with Rose? —sad episode, but I can't recall the name of it. LOVED it, but I completely didn't understand it. To save DVR space, I delete Who episodes after I've watched them more than once, unless I LOVE them (last three episodes!) or unless I'm not sure I understand them (last three episodes, too, lol!) But I have like, okay over 50 episodes so I can't easily find it. It had two 10s I think, and one crossed over to stay with Rose in that other universe, but the other 10 didn't. **What is that episode?** (I'd like to watch it again! ASAP!) Anyway, is THAT how 11 is buried on Tranzadore, or is it that a future no-more-regenerations Doctor still gets buried there. (*Sorry; like I said, I'm really green at this. I never thought about a regeneration leaving* something behind, like a snakeskin.)

&gt;&gt; **What did John Hurt do? Is that still future?**

&gt; The Doctor can still age even if he's not on his last body. Look at the First Doctor, for instance. The War Doctor was between the Eighth and Ninth Doctors (we even saw both sides of the regeneration). What he did is long past, before series 1.

Oh GEE I feel stupid!!! I thought he came between 10 and 11... n/m my brain fart! I just never got it (one prob with starting Who in 2014 episode 239 (or S7 ep 13). I was so excited because, well, I'd had no idea about regenerations at all, and IIRC I ***really think*** I'd thought he was ""the first Doctor"" with the great big evil secret. Okay, **that** must be because I'd seen Rose FIRST as ""the Tardis soul"" thing, and then wham, there's ""my darkest secret"" Doctor.

I probably need a book. Do they have books? This must be like what it's like to watch GoT but not have read any of the books. :) Still, it's wonderful. Except the weeping angels, who scare the CRAP out of me.

Another bad with watching in ""reverse"" order: I thought the MOTW was the Silents in Impossible Planet/Satan Pit (because he had all the writing on him?), LOL! Oh, they used to be scarier to me than those freaking angels, but as a Catholic, I can appreciate ""the Silents"" because MY priest once blew my Confession (accidentally; used it in a lesson, and ***everyone knew*** because I'd told so many my secret sin, so they knew the priest had blown my Confession. Which in my Faith, OMG it's just NOT something you do. BIG FAT no no. You can get axed for that.) No really, I think the Silents are spooky but I LOVE their purpose.

&gt;&gt; Have River and the Doctor ever *hooked up? If so... when? No, no: why? I see chemistry there, and they're cute and all, but if they know what they know... is she planning on outsmarting (or did she already outsmart) whoever kidnapped her?

&gt; They're married and he took her on dates during her nights in Stormcage. What do you think?

Um... I'm thinking I missed a HUGE episode :( Of the listed ones on the internet, I've never seen ""Voyage of the Damned"" and ""Christmas Carol""... might it have been in one of those?! Or is it a webisode? Or watching out of order as I did, I may have just not made an important connection. I'll look up a list of ""River episodes""... well, it's good to know they DID IT! OOOH YEAH GO DOCTOR!

Brings up another question: so 10 apparently loved Rose in a romantic way for real, then, but never hooked up with her in his own timeline; 11 hooked up with and married River (I do remember their wedding; brought tears!). **Does that mean 12 will have nothing to do with River? :(**

Also, crying over your SONIC FREAKING SCREWDRIVERS!!! D: :'(

No, really, I love them! Did you handmake them?! They look better than the toys I've seen this summer, times a thousand easy!

Talkchelsea.com is a great forum.  it has threads on all current and past players as well as transfer targets.  you can read through those as well.

and then of course youtube is a great resource.

and finally search for a local Chelsea supporters group.  we have them in just about every city in the USA.  you can meet up with fellow supporters and watch the matches in pubs/bars.

&gt;

&gt;After the first series ended, ITV announced that *Broadchurch* would return for a second series.  The show's creator, Chris Chibnall, told the *[The Daily Mirror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Mirror)* in the summer of 2013 that ""the focus of the next series will be on how the shattered community rebuilds itself after the grisly events"" of series one.  Series one actor Will Mellor strongly implied in an interview that a new murder would not be the focus of the new season. 

&gt;David Tennant, Olivia Colman,  Andrew Buchan, Arthur Darvill, and Jodie Whittaker are returning cast members.  New series two cast members include [Marianne Jean-Baptiste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marianne_Jean-Baptiste), [James D'Arcy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_D%27Arcy), [Eve Myles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve_Myles), [Charlotte Rampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Rampling), and [Phoebe Waller-Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoebe_Waller-Bridge). 

&gt;The plot of series two has been closely guarded. Cast members were sworn to secrecy about the details,  and required to sign non-disclosure agreements.  Actor Andrew Buchan said cast members have been told little about the plot, except on a need-to-know basis as they prepare for their performances in each episode.  News media, however, have reported that the series returns to the fictional town of Broadchurch. Some scenes have been filmed in a cemetery, and other scenes depict a very pregnant Beth Latimer.

You can't swear on network TV in the states, or any nudity (this is controlled by the FCC and they're fucking harsh). Network TV is anything that airs on normal airwaves without an additional (and separate) subscription. So, if you just pay for basic cable TV in the US you hundreds of channels including ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC and PBS etc. This is like BBC/ITV/Sky/basically all TV in the UK. 

Any TV shows that you've seen swearing or nudity on are on channels like AMC, HBO, Showtime etc. where basically you're paying extra money just to get that channel (this doesn't really exist in the UK aside from sports and pornography). Because you're paying for that particular channel the FCC doesn't have the same rules, you know what you're paying for.

So basically, there is no swearing or nudity on american TV, unless you specifically pay for channels that allow for it. That is why american guests are surprised that you can swear, but also why you've seen swearing on american TV.

edit: Think about the TV you've watched and what channel its on, i.e. Lost was on ABC, no swearing, no nudity, Game of thrones is on HBO...everything!

Christchurch (you see Poole, Bournemouth and Christchurch here going left to right.) is as I expected, dense with Christians. Being one of the highest percentage of retired people in the UK, majority white British, CoE does rather well down here.

Finally, Poole and Bournemouth having greater than 27.5% Atheist/no religion is somewhat of a surprise but understandable. Poole is a Liberal Democratic seat and generally where the younger people live. Full of quite trendy areas and seafront property. Lot of working professionals live inside Poole. Bournemouth is now a student town and has shed its ""old person's sea-side holiday"" image. We've got some poorer areas that are also dense with non-Christian religion citizens (largely Muslim) such as Charminster, Southbourne and Boscombe.

Go back 20 years and I'd say Bournemouth would be as red as Christchurch for Christians, Poole would probably be floating around the same though.

I know a lot of my confusion comes from out-of-order watching (the final 3 eps being my first, *though they're what got me addicted*). I wish I could have waited for the BBC to air them all, then watched them in a better order, because I've learned that my first impressions (eg, that ""companion=Impossible Girl"") stayed in my head even during the rewatch in the right order!

&gt; It's not worded very well, but it's supposed to forbid posts of pictures of those things that are banned. People used to flood this place with posts of pictures of cracks in stuff, write ""bad wolf"" on stuff and post pictures of that, and post pictures of generic angel statues, which is why they were banned. Feel free to discuss it all you want.

YAY! Well, I understand why that would get old (and being a huge /r/asoiaf (Game of Thrones) fan, I def. understand people getting bored between long stretches and overdoing memes, etc... I left a subreddit because of it before.)

&gt; The whole ""companions falling in love with the Doctor"" trope is a relatively new thing and generally confined to New Who. Previous companions generally just hung out and had adventures without all of that relationship drama.

**Followup question!** Thanks for that; I had no idea. On 2nd rewatch I picked up on *Christmas* being a theme, and wondered if that was NewWho or always so. But also, and maybe a little troubling for me personally, was a suggestion *I think* that the Doctors ALL meet their companions as children, and if that's the case, it seems a bit ...*perverted.* You know? I think that's why the 11/Pond thing turned me off (again, Amy/Rory were the last companions I saw in my first viewing this year, so the thing with the leaf, then 11/Amy **and** 11/Clara as kids, I wondered if the Doctor was a ...*child molester* or something. Left a very bad taste in my mouth. But rewatching in order helped a lot.)

&gt; Hurt was the incarnation between the 8th Doctor (McGann) and the 9th Doctor (Eccleston). He fought in the Time War, it's insinuated that he did a lot of potentially terrible un-Doctorish stuff during that period. He says in Name of the Doctor that to him the name ""Doctor"" wasn't just a name, but a code of conduct. The 8th Doctor realized that he couldn't do anything about the Time War if he abided by those rules, so he abandoned them, which meant he abandoned the name ""Doctor"" for that regeneration. So yes, he is the 9th incarnation of that Time Lord, but he didn't consider that incarnation of himself ""The Doctor"". 

I saw the YT video where he was dying then drank that potion (of the Carn? Cairn? The keepers of eternity or whoever), and that he was ""dead"", but not regenerated to 9 yet because those ladies could control the regeneration. Right? So he never ""died""/regenerated *there*: they did some special magic to him so he was the War Doctor.

*And they were expecting him* because if he didn't become the War Doctor, the universe would die.

OH! WAIT THIS is where Not-Rose comes in... she's the weapon the War Doctor was about to use so she showed him the future with 10 and 11! (I didn't know *that* was the same guy! DUH! I feel so stupid now!)

I guess I still just don't get how he doesn't ""count"" as ""9"", though, since he'd been on the Tardis and spent time doing Doctor things and aged. I suppose the potion he drank *undid* those things because no Doctor *could* do those things? Or the Cairn ladies (being ""eternals"" or whatever) could maybe ..""redefine"" and control the entirety of his regeneration. So he WAS a Doctor, but a special one, ""the War Doctor."" And he turned into 9/Eccleston. Am I understanding that close enough?

(NO idea why he and 11 don't remember that though. Seriously, *none*. A guy told me there were comic books out that would explain it, so I'll look those up. There's probably a copy or a summary of those online, I bet.)

*I feel like I can just* almost *grasp it, and then it slips away.* But in a way it seems like he may have been *the most important* Doctor. IDK, and of course now I'd like to see *him* as Doctor onscreen, though I suppose we get the gist of his story enough. Plus I'm excited for Capaldi's Doctor!!! —will he be ""12""?

Thanks again, oh and **especially** for this:

&gt; ""Time can be rewritten"", the theme of Moffatt's run. I didn't really get it when I watched the episode either, but I remember reading an article a while back where Moff explained that the ""original"" timeline was the one where they visited the graveyard had the 11th Doctor dying on Trenzalore. Clara's intervention to provoke the Time Lords into giving him a new set of regenerations rewrote it, creating a new timeline where he regenerated into the 12th.

Claudio Ranieri manages the club from 2000 to 04, establishing the foundation for future excellence (yay!) 

Roman Abramovich purchases the club and gives it quite the cash infusion (yay!) 

Jose Mourinho takes over as manages the club in 2004 after winning the Champions League with Porto. (yay!) 

Chelsea win 2 trophies in 2005, including the Premier League (yay!!!) 

Chelsea win the Premier League again in 2006. (yay!) 

Chelsea win the FA cup in 2007. (yay!) 

Didier Drogba, Frank Lampard, John Terry, Petr Cech, Joe Cole, Ashley Cole, Michael Essien, Claude Makelele and more become absolute legends during this time. (yay!) 

Mourinho is replaced by Avram Grant in 2007 (OMGWTFBBQ!) 

Chelsea soldier through the shock of Mourinho's departure and almost win the Champions League for the first time in their history, only narrowly losing to ManU in penalties. (boo!) 

Grant is replaced with Scolari in 2008. (yay at first, but boo eventually) Scolari is replaced mid-season with Guss Hiddink and we win the FA cup (yay!) 

Guus leaves due to his international obligations and Ancelotti fills the manager vacancy (yay!) Under Ancelotti we won the Premier League and the FA Cup (yay!) 

A mid-season dip in form causes Ancelotti's days to be numbered in 2011 (boo!) 

Chelsea's front line isn't what it used to be, so we broke the piggy bank on Fernando Torres. (I wont boo Nando, but it hasn't worked out so well) 

Andre Villas Boas gets us off to a terrible season, benches most of the senior players and loses the dressing room in 2011-12. (boo) 

Before the end of the season, Villas-Boas was sacked, and assistant manager and legend Robbie Di Matteo takes the reigns. (yay!) 

Robbie seizes victory from the jaws of defeat, leading Chelsea to their first Champions League victory in the club's 100+ year history. (YAY!!!!)

Robbie is terminated, of course. (boo!) 

Rafa Benitez happened. (boo!) 

Jose Mourinho came back in 2013 after winning everything with Inter Milan and making Real Madrid feel sad (yay! and OMGWTFBBQ!)

This time around, Jose is giving the legends a graceful departure as he prepares this young squad for world domination. We lost our Lamps talisman, but we still have our Captain and Legend John Terry who is still near the top of his game, we got Drogba back for a season, and we have a nearly unmatched roster of young talent wating to take the world by storm. 2014-15 is going to be epic.

true,ebi0494,null,null,"I have some questions questions for you:  1)  Have you seen the rest of the season?  There are times in the show where knowledge that was given is later taken away, as is the case with Donna Noble.  That doesn't mean it isn't part of a larger picture.  I think the most important part of this episode is the mythology of the Tardis.  It's got a very Alice in Wonderland vibe to it.  It's a place that the viewer hasn't had many opportunities to venture into which may be what influenced some people to feel positively about it.  I know for myself I really enjoy the episodes that focus on the Tardis.  For example, I feel that the Doctor's Wife is easily one of the best episodes of the new series, imo.  I felt that Journey to the Center of the Tardis added to the audience's perspective of the Tardis in some of the same ways.  You get to see the rooms, the quirks, the living metal... it's very fantastic; it feeds into the mythology that Steven Moffat has very carefully built up which paints Doctor Who as a fairy tale.  Who doesn't love a good fairy tale?

2)  Why can't the Doctor help himself?  There are plenty of times that variations of the Doctor team up for a common goal in the old series prior to the 2005 reboot.  Usually it's different incarnations of the Doctor, but I don't think it's such an issue that it breaks the episode that it's also the same incarnation of the Doctor.  It's not like he's running around high-fiving himself and generating paradoxes.  It's much more sly, which is why I think it works in this instance.  I'm going to assume that you're watching these episodes in a linear manner.  If this isn't the case (ignore the following).  How is him helping himself in the Pandorica Opens/Big Ban episodes different than how he helps himself here?

* Are you required to be on site? Could you take tomorrow off. As a consultant/company you provide your availability and allocate time. If you are told you have to work X.

* Being told by your client that you have to take X time off (sometimes known as mandatory time away)

Citation needed. 

Apart from the a tiny minority of people who may require circumcision for legitimate medical reasons (not the bullshit ones you're pushing) the practice should be banned outright on children. For their protection, which is more important than the previously accepted legitimisation and protection of the perverted practises of ancient, dying religions. 

Now, if you're an adult and decide, like various body-modders do, that you want to mutilate your own genitals, then by all means go ahead and enjoy yourself. It's your body. On children though? Abhorrent.

&gt; However, to put male circumcision in the same class as FGM is, to my mind, a rather hysterical position that requires one to disregard important and obvious differences in the rationale and long-term effects of what are quite different practices. 

A pathetically weak argument if ever there was one. They both involve mutilating the genitals of children - It doesn't get more comparable than that. It's very sad that in the 21st century there are still (a minority) of repressed people advocating the genital mutilation of children.

true,iamaravind,lfc12,,"there was an article I that I read up recently on the best young attacking players in Europe currently. this was a properly researched article, not one based off youtube highlights or one-off matches, but through the use of Opta stats and an algorithm called YAPSS. When used as an example on the wonderkid attacking players of 2010, it had a pretty good success rate in establishing that players such as Toni Kroos, Hazard and yes even a young Marco Reus were bound to become world class. it's not perfect mind you; it did throw up Adam Johnson and Holtby as potential world beaters too, but it does work overwhelmingly well.

Anyway the point of this is that in this year's analysis one defender, yes a DEFENDER, had a notable YAPSS and was included in the attacking player model. his name? Ricardo Rodriquez. Only one other prospect in the past five years has achieved this feat of appearing in this attacking model as a defender. That kid was Gareth Bale. 

Rodriguez is pricy yes, but he has more potential then Luke Shaw and would cost about the same amount in fees but so much less in wages. Cause we're not that stupid to pay someone 160k per week on his first big contract, but that's a completely different story.

R.R has the potential to make that Left Back role his own for the next decade, and with Flanagan on the right, Sakho and Lovren in the middle, we have one hellova formidable defense. If he signs for us, I can conclude to be thoroughly happy with this summer's business.

true,ImRobin,logo,,"There are many things that don't make sense with this insane saga. 

I personally believe that Yaya was extremely upset with his little brother's disease, and everyone that's lost a close family member knows how much this affects your mind and ability to think straight. His agent is his advisor, and probably didn't have much trouble convincing Yaya to make the puclic comments that he did. The only thing on his mind was probably the loss of his brother. 

It didn't help that the media went berserk over this (which is natural), and Yaya had to deal with the loss of his brother, the World Cup, and a media storm, which is his agent's job to strategically handle. 

It's hard to know how much of what Yaya's said that's his own words and real thoughts throughout this whole ordeal. I do not think a kind and thoughtful man like our City hero would use a horribly sad situation like this to get a raise. It just doesn't make sense. 

I believe there has been confusion, miscommunication, misunderstandings, and hurt feelings. If Yaya feels strongly about staying, then I'm a 100% sure he'd sort things out with the club before he made such a decision. The fact that he does an interview where he talks a lot about his brother with the MCFC TV team means he doesn't hold any grudges against the club. It wouldn't make sense that he talked about it if it was Manchester City he really was upset with.

Let's face it: we have one of the world's best players, regardless of position on the field, in our team. He was immense last season, scored a ton of goals, and IS a role model to many players. Quality like him attracts other players, and if it's possible to put him into a coaching role in 2-3 years, then that would be fantastic. 

Let's not be sore too long here. We forgave Tevez, and he was a total cunt towards the club.

This part is key for me. Imagine Sturridge gets injured and is out for a month - would we be ok with Lambert and Borini leading the line? 


In short, I think no. Lambert could probably do it for a couple of games, but I'm not sure how he'd cope with playing in the PL on the Saturday and then the CL on the Tuesday. And Borini I'm not really convinced about. He doesn't seem to have that confidence/arrogance on the ball that Brendan likes in his players. The club don't seem to rate him all that much either or we wouldn't want to sell him to Sunderland.

true,wiztwas,null,null,"There is no way anyone can say what is ""Best"" beer in the UK there is so much diversity.  what you need to do is to try a few and see what you like.

There are certainly a lot of beers that are similar to the lagers and craft beers of the US, if that is what you want then stay in the US because they do some really great beers of that style. 

In the UK Pale Ales are more varied, they are called ""Bitter"" on draught in Pubs.  

If you can find it Mild is different, stout is another extreme, you may have encountered Guinness already that is not a cask beer, it is a keg beer and has a nitrogen gas creamy head.  

In pubs there are 2 types of bee on tap, Keg and Cask

I avoid kegs unless the landlord is rubbish and doesn't keep cask beer properly. 

Cask is normally on a hand pump it has much less gas is generally a good bit warmer and has a lot more flavour.

Once you get a taste for the variety, you can go in a pub order a pint of something random, and enjoy it for what it is.  I think that most of the time, I (an experienced drinker) can find something I have never had before in a good pub (and I often go for it).

The level of diversification may surprise you, it astonishes me and I live and drink here. 

Yes, there are a few beers I just love and go back to time and time again, there are breweries that I have a penchant for, but unless you come to where I am you will probably not see them.

If you are near the Reading area (Left a bit of London) Look out for the Loddon Brewery beers, Hocus Pocus &amp; Bamboozle are favourites of mine.

On the bottled front there are some nice beers, but they are not as good as proper cask ales and if you want the real beer experience then you need to go to pubs.

On finding good pubs, there are 2 really good tools in my experiance, The first is BITE http://www.beerintheevening.com/ put in your postcode and it will find you pubs with ratings.  The other tool is sidefinder http://www.morrisfed.org.uk/phpfinder/front.php Sidefinder is not a pub finding tool, it is a way of finding local morris dancers, now this is a bit weird but here is the logic.  Morris Dancing, whether you like it or not is an old tradition kept alive by people who love it.  They Dance at a lot of pubs, they attract custom to pubs, but they don't get paid, they might not always get unlimited free beer.  So they choose the best local pubs, the places they want to drink.  So find a local ""Side"" and look on their website to see where they are dancing, it doesn't matter when, just use their local knowledge to find the local pubs.   

Find me a country pub give me a pint of something interesting, a good ploughman's lunch and a shady garden on a warm summers day and you have my slice of heaven.

I am saving for modules of an open university degree that can be between £60-£200 depending on the cost of the module every month. I am also saving to retake my a-levels which is about £122 a month. My bus pass currently takes up £142 a month. Bills that I have are about £61 a month ( insurance, mobile bills, e.t.c) also out of that I budget £500 a month of just spending costs (£100 a week budget). I am near enough self sufficient at home. 

I do not ask my parents for money and they haven't given me any money in 2-3 years. Although I don't pay rent when I am at home I use all my money to support myself save for food, and even then I support myself a lot in that, and utilities. The reason why I want to move out is because I feel that even though I'm living at home for 'free' it is such a toxic environment that it is better to pay to move out and have sanity that to live here and start considering suicide (which I have done at least twice in the past 3 years because of my home environment) When I was saying that £420 was my monthly budget I was hoping that would include my entire rent and utilities because I am looking to rent a room somewhere not a house(I live in London) Am I being severely naieve or is that do-able?

Couple of miss conceptions here, it's actually easier in many ways to do a country road than it is a city, as you've far less going on, fewer 'objects' to identify from your imaging.  Motorways are probably the easiest.

I'm very out of date on this, as it was 10 years ago I built my last autonomous robot, but I was using LiDAR scanning for short to medium, and RADAR for long in front and behind, thou I didn't have the money to implement it.  Ultrasound covered the blind spots, because that is so damned cheap.

A cornish hedge is the worst thing, as it will limit the line of sight, but it  is easy to make something that can travel at some speed down such a road.

I imagine Ade is still recovering from malaria, and besides, we want Soldado with as much game time under his belt and - hopefully - a goal or two.

Six sessions is a sticking plaster, you might be able to deal with the current crisis and stabilise the risk in the short term but it doesn't give you the opportunity to deal with any of the underlying issues or causes so the child inevitably ends up falling into crisis again a few months later.

They undoubtedly had the best player in the game today in the form of Chewy Suarez, but again, if we get some investment (hoping against hope Everton officials have got some idea about where we're going to move), and we keep these players long enough to create strong relationships, especially in the attacking department, you never know.

It's not out of the question, but like I said, it would be a massive ask, especially without investment.

A mate of mine has done some really amazing research in monocular vision mapping.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRom2itBgWE

That's just so damned cool.  Sadly I can understand far too little of how it really works.  But the main thing is, old vision techniques (like the ones I used) work by finding 'edges' and 'corners' these are bits where there is a big change in contrast or if using LiDAR depth.   [A google for Canny Edge will demonstrate this stuff](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGN0GxGEDsY) that was as advanced as my stuff ever got.  What they do with that SLAM shananigans is to use the whole image, they are looking at textures, so they can detect movement of the camera, really, really acurately.  In Steve's video he is coming it against a system that uses a few obvious corners.  But you will obviously get a much better sample from using the whole image.

The ability to make that kind of advanced image processing in real time, really helps making autonomous vision enabled devices.  The accuracy that is achieved there is great, with only one camera.  That way you put your camera 'pairs' split across the car, this gives you redundency against things like light blinding, dirt blocking sensor, rock hitting sensor etc.

Myself I think his kind of research (thou if he asks, he is a filthy student bum who should have his dreams crushed by the real world of industry, like me) is what's needed to actually make these things feesable.  I don't think having a giant LiDAR sensor on the roof is remotely practical solution.

You get periods like now where the economy is all taps on growth. People get silly rich, inequality grows, then you hit a brick wall. Suddenly your public can't afford the luxuries on which the wealth of the rich is made on.

This is where the second phase generally moves in. A combination of popular political will and the drive of some more long term thinking capitalists (realising that your workers had better be able to afford your cars) creates an environment for more redistribution. Economic progress slows but the general well being of the public explodes. Eventually though the process of levelling slows down the economy so much that it starts to be self consuming.

The real problem is the transition between these stages is always fraught with political resistance. A common trend seems to be that the advocates for the status quo always believe we are at the end of history.

The capitalists in the Victorian era believed that their system would prevail. The poor were a bit better off and they were a lot better off. Everyone won. They fought tooth and nail against redistribution.

Then the socialists of the post war era believed they were at the end of history. They had won and redistribution was going to be ratcheted. Even as pay rises caused inflation far more than they caused improved standards of living.

I think right now we are where we were in the Victorian era again. The public can barely afford existence right now. How can you get rich when your public are starting to cut energy use and luxuries while still not being able to afford either retirement or to pay for their homes?

IMO it's a fantastic service and seems to work out cheaper than the standard private taxi services.

Black Cab drivers are getting nervous with the new competition though and are arguing that the app is effectivley a taxi meter, which only black cabs are legally allowed to use. So they are taking them to court.

Uber have popped up in loads of countries and a few have deemed them illegal, again it seems to mostly stem from fear of competition.

Personally I dont see what the difference is between Uber and any of the other hundreds of private taxi companies, but as Uber have a lot of investment behind them they've been able to cause quite a lot of disruption.

There was an interesting article I read a few weeks back that talks about how a blackcab licence was one of the best investments you could make in London. People would spend hundreds of thousands of pounds on them, and they would be pretty much guaranteed to return a profit. So you can see why some very rich people would be afraid of the new service.

2) I've seen very little of the original Doctor Who, so I can only speak about the 2005+ one. The reason why he can't go back and help himself is that it has been established that he can't. The whole you can't change your own personal timeline thing.

I can't compare it to the previous episodes, because I can't remember them that well. But now that I think about it I *suppose* the excuse here might be that he used an accidentally existing rift in time, rather than travel back with the TARDIS. Still a paradox, but...I don't know.

&gt; Apart from the a tiny minority of people who may require circumcision for legitimate medical reasons (not the bullshit ones you're pushing) the practice should be banned outright on children. For their protection, which is more important than the previously accepted legitimisation and protection of the perverted practises of ancient, dying religions.

This is all so clearly driven by emotion and opinion that I can't really take it seriously. I can understand the arguments against routinely circumcising infants and am broadly in favour of changing things so that it happens less and less and becomes a choice adults can make for themselves. You seem to be leveraging the issue as part of some ongoing culture war.

&gt; A pathetically weak argument if ever there was one. They both involve mutilating the genitals of children - It doesn't get more comparable than that.

Well if we're going to be rude then I'll just point out that your argument is plainly dishonest. You're drawing the comparison to the level that serves your argument rather than looking at the actual differences and similarities between FGM and circumcision. The most obvious and relevant point of comparison is the extent of the functional damage done. Clearly the removal or the foreskin is not in the same league as a clitorectomy in terms of severity and impact on sexual health and enjoyment. If circumcision involved amputation of the glans, then you'd have a point.

&gt; It's very sad that in the 21st century there are still (a minority) of repressed people advocating the genital mutilation of children. 

It's very sad that so many people prefer to argue from a position of self-righteous moral outrage rather than critical thought, the ability to place these practices in a wider context and an understanding that achieving change requires a practical approach.

If we could automate everything we should. The only thing is that our current economic system is one which encourages people to be productive. As we move away from needing everyone to be constantly productive to maintain society, there needs to be a better way of distributing wealth.

If society needs everyone working capitalism is a good way to get that to happen. But as society needs less and less labour to function to a standard that people are happier with, capitalism just drives the wealth upwards to those who already hold the wealth. There is enough to go around, but we are still operating a system a system that needs each individual to perform a task to earn their share.

I should add I don't think we are there yet, but we are moving in that direction, we still need the vast majority of people working and as I said capitalism incentivises that. But signs are showing. GDP has grown massively over the past 30 years, as efficiency is improved, but workers aren't getting a share of that and wages have stagnated, so those returns are going to investors. This is good to a degree, as incentivises more investment, funding more efficiency, but when the benefits of those efficiencies aren't shared around, and society becomes more unequal, (between those who already have who find it easier to get more, and those who don't who find it harder to get more) people get left behind which is a bad thing. If people can't participate in society they try and keep up through debt. 

Some might say this is happening already and for the past 20 years the increasing in debt has hidden the fact that what people earn isn't keeping up with the advances in efficiency we've made. One of the country's main industry is founded on debt where we are spending money we have to pay back one day.

&gt;

&gt;___Rose Tyler: Earth Defence___ was the title given to a proposed, but ultimately aborted *Doctor Who* spin-off set some time after Rose's final parting from the Tenth Doctor at the conclusion of *Doomsday*.


&gt;Based on dialogue in that final story, the series most likely was intended to feature Rose's life on the alternate Earth the Doctor had dubbed ""Pete's World"", working with that reality's version of the Torchwood Institute.


&gt;The series had been commissioned by BBC One but abruptly cancelled by Russell T Davies, who decided that it would have lessened the impact of *Doomsday*. The spin-off was cancelled before Billie Piper had been formally approached. Reportedly the original plan was to produce a one-off special (likely for broadcast around a holiday, possibly Easter), followed by more specials if demand warranted, in lieu of a weekly series.

true,Blubbey,null,null,"&gt; I would love it if this subreddit got behind our captain

Dawson is not the type of player that excels in Poch's system - i.e. splitting and spreading the ball. He's getting on, he's slow (and has been for a while) and will only get slower. His distribution isn't that good and last year, he usually played it short to Paulinho (as an example). He's not the most confident on the ball from what I've seen either. I would love it if you wouldn't try to justify keeping Daws by aerial duels. Wow, such importance. You realise there're more ways to defending than that right? You don't *have* to go in for the header, you don't *have* to jump with the man. Get in behind, put him off (nudge him or something) so 1) his header doesn't go anywhere and 2) he doesn't make the header. Stand off him, react to the header.  Pretend to go, drop off, react to it (i.e. intercept, close down if he brought it down, stay with the man the header's intended for). You can jump with him, not actually go ""for"" the ball but pressure him. Make him make a mistake. Again, tanking that ""aerial duel"" stat.

Stats on their own mean very little. I.e. I've seen interception stats passed around. Unfortunately, if those people knew about the game they'd understand that good positioning will tank that stat. IF you're positioned well, you won't get interceptions because they won't pass because of your position. You also won't make a tackle because they won't pass to their player, you won't be able to win aerial duels because of no pass, you won't get clearances because there won't be any chances to because of no balls played in. But oh, they must be worse because their stats are lower.",0,1406717498,null,0,false,0,cjbw1v1,t3_2c4now,t1_cjbw1v1,t3_2c4now,null,1434971714,-3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,-3

By the time they reached their objectives outside Stanley the paras were a full 24 hours ahead of the Marines and had to dig in and wait for their arrival.

Three regiments set out to march across the islands and only two made it, the Paras, followed by the Marines. The Scots guards dropped out on their tab and had to be airlifted to their objective. Both the paras and Marines lost men on the tab also, there were no overboots issued to the troops and due to the terrain being boggy and below freezing the majority of the men came down with trenchfoot to some degree and some even developed frostbite, yet the paras an Marines marched on.

After marching to their objectives all were captured, the Scots Guards took Tumbledown, Royal Marines took the Two Sisters, 3 Para took Mt. Longdon and 2 Para took Wireless Ridge making 2 Para the only unit in the conflict to fight two battles independently.

Only by playing a lot for a manager who will drill the shit out of him to make better decisions and take up better positions will he get there.  I'd be willing to suffer through a painful first third of the season to start seeing some good stuff from him.

Don't forget that at the start of last season, he was our only attacking threat.  Game after game he opened teams up, and although his end product was poor, he has that X factor that can turn a game on a dime.  I just don't see Chadli having that same impact, even though as you say, he has a better footballing brain and can interchange more adeptly with the others.

My concern is that having three relatively slow ball-playing attackers all banked up behind a single striker will stagnate our play much like it did under AVB.  We need someone incisive when we can't play through teams, and arguably Lennon's pace is the only other option we've got there.

We are reaching to do something we've not ever done in the EPL era - install ourselves as a regular 4th place finisher.

To do that, we need players playing out of their skins all over the park.  Look at some of our other players - Lamela, Eriksen, Vertonghen, Lloris, Adebayor.  All proven match-winners.  There's no use Eriksen working his magic every other week if we're gonna concede easy goals via weak links at the back.  And I'm not talking about ""weak links"" in the sense of gifting other teams goals like we did at various points last year, but ""weak links"" for a 4th place chasing club.  Margins are very fine when you get close to the top, and giving a player like Hazard, Rooney or Aguero a couple of feet they shouldn't have can be enough to punish you and lose UCL football.

Plus, stats definitely don't tell the full story.  Half the reason Dawson and Rose's stats aren't that bad is because too many times last campaign we conceded goals because they just weren't where they were supposed to be.

By 1914 his rolling assembly line made his factories incredibly efficient, greatly reducing the labour costs per car, but it was causing high employee turnover because the work was hard and monotonous.

He raised wages and reduced the working day from 9 to 8 hours, figuring that not only would it reduce turnover, but by attracting good employees and keeping them motivated, the pay rise would pay for itself. It also allowed him to run three shifts a day instead of two, increasing his production figures.

This all worked very well, and he said “The payment of five dollars a day for an eight-hour day was one of the finest cost-cutting moves we ever made"", and in 1919 he rose wages again.

Subsequently he wrote about the importance for industries to ""keep wages high and prices low"" so that their employees were amongst their best customers, and that by increasing his employees buying power, it caused a knock-on effect increasing the buying power of others. He wrote of the wage-motive being more important than the profit-motive.

And yet during this time he didn't raise wages significantly. He rose wages to $6 in 1919, throughout the twenties he wrote about the importance of high wages, and yet he only raised the wage to $7 when the economy soured in 1929, which was a failed attempt of his to prevent recession.",0,1406719773,null,0,false,0,cjbwjc8,t3_2c4cje,t1_cjbwjc8,t1_cjbv5rc,null,1434971945,20,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,20

Indeed so, and that'll be their next attack on Uber if the meter thing fails. The meter argument is really just trying to stop them on a technicality. The metered fare isn't the main selling point of Uber, and if they just change the app to stop using GPS and charge the estimated fare then they're back in business. Customers would probably prefer to know the exact fare when they book rather than just an estimated price range anyway, so the service just got better.

The real threat to taxis is that pressing a button in the app and having it locate you by GPS and direct a driver to you isn't just easier than phoning a private hire office and knowing where you are, it's potentially easier than flagging down a black cab. The LTDA's next argument will be that since there's no office or phone operator involved in booking through Uber, you're not really booking through an intermediary and the driver is actually booking his own fares at the side of the road, which only a taxi can do.

This seems like a weaker argument than meters, where Uber is certainly breaking the spirit of the rules if not the letter of them.

Oh, give it a chance.

&gt;Thank you for your email about the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Bill. 
&gt;
&gt;As Private Parliamentary Secretary to the Home Secretary I follow the debates surrounding communications data and interception closely.  I agree we need to protect privacy but also believe we need to prevent criminal exploitation of communications networks.
&gt;
&gt;The UK faces two significant and urgent problems relating to communications data and interception. First, the recent judgement by the European Court of Justice which calls into question the legal basis upon which we require communication service providers in the UK to retain communications data; and second, the increasingly pressing need to put beyond doubt the application of our laws on interception. This is so communication service providers have to comply with their legal obligations, irrespective of where they are based.
&gt;
&gt;The Bill is being fast-tracked following the ruling from the European Court of Justice but Parliament will ensure there is proper scrutiny and debate.
&gt;
&gt;I attended the Home Secretary’s Statement on this matter last week. Members of the Home Affairs Select Committee also questioned her at length on Monday and the Bill is being debated in the House today.  The wider issues relating to communications data were debated by a Joint Committee in Parliament which took evidence from professionals and law enforcement agencies. The Joint Intelligence and Security Committee have also taken evidence in public for the first time where this matter was discussed. 
&gt;
&gt;Communications data – the who, where, when and how of a communication but not its content – is a vital tool in the investigation of crime and safeguarding the public. It has been used in 95% of serious and organised crime investigations handled by the Crown Prosecution Service and every major Security Service counter-terrorism investigation over the last decade. The bill doesn’t include a dramatic extension of these existing capabilities; its intention is only to prevent a degradation of communications data which is vital to keep us safe in the future.
&gt;
&gt;Given the strong feelings surrounding this issue I have spent a great deal of time discussing this matter with fellow Members of Parliament. It is also my intention to follow the passage of the Bill, together with any amendments, closely. 
&gt;
&gt;I hope this is helpful and offers you some reassurances.

&gt;In 2014:

&gt;For a couple with two children:

&gt;    In 2008 if each parent earned £14,000 the family would reach an acceptable living standard.
&gt;    If their earnings had increased in line with the average since 2008, they would now earn £15,000 each.
&gt;    That is over £5,000 short of the £20,400 each they would need to earn today to reach an acceptable living standard.

&gt;For a lone parent:

&gt;    A lone parent with one child needs to earn £27,000 – more than double the £12,000 needed in 2008.

&gt;For a single person:

&gt;    A single person without children needs to earn £16,400 – up from £13,500 in 2008, but down slightly compared to 2013.

tl;dr: more people struggle to achieve a minimum acceptable standard of living now which is basically what /u/G_Morgan was talking about

I would like him to leave, he's not worth £14 million so if we were to sell him and Agger (apparently for £12m), we'd still have a load of money. Our signings so far:

- Rickie Lambert, £4m 
- Adam Lallana, £25m 
- Emre Can, £10m 
- Lazar Markovic,£20m 
- Dejan Lovren, £20m 
- Divock Origi, £10m 

Total: £89m

We *apparently* had a budget of £60m; add that to the £70m-ish we got for Suarez and we have a total budget of £130m. (£130m - £89m) + £26m (Borini + Agger) = **£67m**. (I think. :P)

From that total left over, I'd quite like another striker and a couple of full backs. Ideally I'd like someone like Bony, somebody like Moreno and somebody like Aurier (I'd imagine £20m each for Bony &amp; Moreno, and £12-15m for Aurier, which would still leave money left over...

Yes, I know - I'm SUPER greedy. The above is entirely unrealistic but one can live in hope.

&gt;Thank you for writing to me about the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Bill and internet privacy. 

&gt;The police and intelligence agencies do vital work to keep us safe. But confidence in their work needs to be maintained, and that means we need a proper debate about how privacy can also be protected, and what powers, checks and balances are needed in the internet age.

&gt;Towards this end, we tabled amendments to put extra safeguards in place, whilst making sure the police don’t lose vital information they need. The Government should not have left this legislation until the last minute before the summer. And they should have engaged much earlier in a serious public debate about what powers should be available to the police and security services and what safeguards are needed for privacy. By ducking the debate and leaving things to the last minute they are undermining trust.

&gt;While we agree that legislation ensuring the police's ability to take the necessary steps to safeguard our security is necessary, such legislation must be coupled with steps to guard our privacy.  There is a desperate need for long term reform. It is a conversation which we must have and which should begin immediately.

&gt;The Labour Party is supporting this temporary legislation as we believe it is necessary for the protection of the British people. However, this legislation must be not be the end of the debate about online security and liberty. It must be the beginning.

&gt;Once again, thank you for writing.

No. I don't think you do. I think you are providing lip-service to the idea in order to appear reasonable. Your feigned sympathy won't bring back the dead civilians, nor will it stop those who are sure to die tomorrow and the next day.

The 'Jews' don't have the Iron Dome. The Israelis do. The two are not the same and I'll not accept that critiscism of Israeli Military and government actions and policy is a form of anti-semitism.

&gt;

&gt;The __Electric Brae__ is a [gravity hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_hill) in [Ayrshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayrshire), Scotland, where cars appear to be drawn uphill by some mysterious attraction. The [Lowland Scots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_language) word *brae* means a hill-slope or brow (with which it is cognate), and the ""electric"" name was given when electricity was a new technology associated with strange forces.

&gt;There is more than one stretch of road known as *Electric Brae*, but the most famous is on the [A719](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A719_road), south of [Dunure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunure), not far from [Ayr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayr), between Drumshrang and Knoweside.  Though the road appears to be running uphill, a suitably free-running vehicle will slowly move off from a standstill. It was widely believed that vehicles were being propelled uphill by a mysterious magnetic force, but the road's apparently uphill slope is an optical illusion.  Metal road signs which used to mark the place have tended to be taken by visitors, and have been replaced by a stone inscribed with an explanation of the phenomenon. 

&gt;During the Second World War, the brae was visited by many American personnel from the [air-base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Air_Transport_Service) at [Prestwick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prestwick), and General [Dwight D Eisenhower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D_Eisenhower), who had a flat at nearby [Culzean Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culzean_Castle), took visitors to see the phenomenon. In 1992 the name was brought wider fame by the novel *[Electric Brae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Brae_(novel\))* by [Andrew Greig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Greig). The name has also been applied to other slopes in Scotland. This phenomenon has also been observed elsewhere in the world, for example outside the [Garda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garda_S%C3%ADoch%C3%A1na) station in [Blackrock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackrock,_Dublin) in Dublin, Ireland.

I think it's only natural that a manager bring someone that he knows and trust to his new club. Alot of managers have done that over the years. But that they let three players go to liverpool, that to me I simply cannot understand.. 

I read an article were Mick Channon (former southampton player) sayin that there is no loyalty left in the players. That it is the players that decide if they want to stay or go. But where is the loyalty from the clubs side. If you let 4 key players go and don't have any plans on who is going to replace them. I mean, then there is somebody thats not doing their job right. 

You cannot then blame the key players that's left if they want to go, it's their career. It's not about loyalty from the players side, its that southampton haven't shown anything to the players that indicates the club moving forward.

How have the Left come into opposition with science?

They're often wrong about the risks from new technologies, such as GMO's or nuclear power.  And the environmentalist left can be incredibly anti-science in their approach to such issues.

Feminism is based on noble aims, but it's currently where facts, statistics and logical thought go to die.  Pretty much all of third wave feminism is based on an ideology which has no connection to reality.

The Left are in denial about many of modern science's findings about human nature.  They celebrate 'diversity' by pretending that it doesn't exist and that every person is created with equal predispositions and talents, which is manifestly untrue.  Thus, IQ tests are seen to be the work of the devil and men and women must have equal preferences and abilities.

And of course the communist Left were massively massively wrong in their theories about how to create better societies.  Millions upon millions have died because of what seemed to be a nice utopian ideology.  Meanwhile, the most successful, freest, most tolerant societies in the world are all, without exception, capitalist in nature.

BTW - I'm left wing myself, but I hope I am not an ideologue.  I'm also well aware that the right harbors its share of anti-science.  Unfortunately, anti-science thinking and anti-intellectualism is common in both political wings.

Terrible news. The problem is, people (like you, presumably) only tend to focus on the good bits, and never stop to think about what could go wrong. What's going to be deemed acceptable in terms of control software, and what isn't? The code clearly isn't going to be audited. There is neither the manpower or the skill base to do that properly. Is little Jimmy's visual basic project going to be allowed on the road? I'd hope you would agree that would be a bad idea. If not, how do you decide what is and isn't acceptable? Do we mandate a spacecraft-like audited hypervisor that takes input from 3 independent implementations and only acts on a majority decision? If so, who gets to enforce the ""3 independent implentations"" rule? What's to stop little Jimmy plugging his code in three times? And why would we trust that even supposedly reputable companies like Google can get it right. They've demonstrated a long history of shipping buggy code.

If the MB ever gets back into power they won't leave the Regime members alone like last time.  

Relationship between the regime and the US and the UK is damaged. They expected to be congratulated for getting rid of MB when both nations were happy with them. The MB wasn't a party of nutters. They kept the peace deal with Israel, stopped weapons smuggling to Gaza, appointed ambassadors to Israel and etc. The new guy in charge has been moving closer to Russia who doesn't have any issues subverting democracy, ignoring coups and mass murder.

true,Shicchan,lfc99,,"Aurier plays for PSG now :( If we sell Johnson, I'd like to see us go for Aurier, who Arsenal were linked with. I don't think he'd be THAT expensive (£8m maybe?) and is a good attacking RB. He's experienced in a top league and in the Champions League, and is 26 so we'll get his best years if we signed him. He'd fit our play attacking wise, but he's a bit poor on crosses. However, if we do find a suitor for Johnson, I'd like to see Uchida at Anfield.

I'm really uninformed about good RB's that we could buy, and seeing as there isn't really any interest for Johnson I don't think it'll be necessary. Moreno on the other hand has to be done, but James Pearce has said it won't happen unless Sevilla lower their £20m asking price. 

I'm not too sure about Bony to be honest. We were all happy with Remy over Bony for £12m less, and I think it shows that we should be aiming higher, and that there is a lot better value and ability for £20m than Bony offers.

Apparently we've been linked with Lacazette who I've never watched play. But I would personally like us to sign Heung Min Son, who we've been linked with a few times actually. He doesn't really play as a lone striker but more of a second striker or left forward. He is a great finisher, dribbler and is as quick as Aubameyang I reckon. He'd be a deadly, young forward for us and he has the potential to be something really special IMO. In a 4-1-2-1-2 he also offers another option as a second striker or CAM. 

Personally, I don't think we need someone of the Bony mould but rather a quick, versatile forward like Heung Min Son. While he doesn't play as the lone striker, I don't think that will be necessary when looking for an attacking option now. In a 4-3-3 there can be fluid interchanging between the wingers and the striker, as we saw last season. I feel that Son and Sturridge are actually quite similar forwards to a certain extent, to be honest.

&gt;Spurs Official

Obviously, if you read it here it is iron. However, do be aware of the club positioning itself in deals, things like ""we won't sell player X"" may very well translate to ""we want more money for player X"". I mean, managers in the passed have dismissed links to players only for us to sign them the same day. 

&gt;Players on social media

Players commonly post goodbye messages on things like instagram before a move is officially revealed. More recently, posts like the one from MS yesterday give an insight into what is happening. 

&gt;BBC and their journalists (guys like Ben Smith)

BBC are always on the pulse and do not post garbage. Because of this, they are normally the last news source to post a story. If something is on the BBC, you can bet they have verified it up and down (note: this doesn't apply to their rumour mill section).

&gt;Di Marzio

Going to mention this guy above other journalists. As you may know our DOF is Baldini, it appears that Di Marzio has Baldini on speed dial. He broke almost all of our transfer news last season (including the unbelievable Lamela) and I expect if we shop outside of England again with Baldini as DOF Di Marzio will be first to break it again.

&gt;Skysports and their journalists (Balague etc)

It wasn't long ago that I would have put these guys up with the BBC. However, since delving into the betting market they now use shit like 'sky sources believe' to sway trends. If they post an article on their website, it is normally quite trustworthy. Do steer clear of tweets that begin with ""sky sources understand..."" or ""betting on XYZ has"". Betting trends only track where people are placing money, not what is actually happening behind the scenes.


&gt;Spurs specific journalists (Stobart, Burt)

These are guys who in the past have shown to be on the money with spurs news. Whilst they don't typically break news, they may post articles that give great insight into how the club is operating.

&gt;Telegraph

Somewhere between BBC and the rags.

&gt;Everything else

This stuff is all hit and miss and really shouldn't be trusted. In here I place ITK and poor media rags like goal, metro, caughtoffside and dailyfail.

Explaining what's going on - No clue. It's all doom and gloom and the moment, the board have made a bunch of big promises though. Only time will tell now

Chances - I think any chance of recreating our successes last season are long gone, we did well mainly due to an incredibly strong start to the season which we were able to lean back on during the Christmas period and the end of the season when our lack of squad depth started to show through. Even if we replace all the players that have gone it will take time to create some team chemistry so we're probably going to have a bad start to the season and we'll still lack squad depth.

Relegation - Too early to say, if the squad stays as it is I think we'll be fine, it won't be pretty but we won't go down. Finish 15th - 13th

If things get worse, as in more players leave, I'd expect us to be right in amongst the relegation battle down to last day but I'd still back us to stay up. I think at least 1 of the new promotees are nailed on to go back down probably 2, I think Villa and West Brom are going to struggle too. Finish 17th - 15th

If things get better, as in we hold on to J-Rod and The Alsatian and make a handful of decent signings, we'll be comfortable.

true,RetepNamenots,cnty-england,England,"&gt; Tonight his distraught sister Gill Thompson told how she believes he may have stopped injecting himself with the life-saving drug after becoming so desperate over his lack of cash and work.

So his sister 'believes' that her brother killed himself because of the changes to his welfare. Two points:

1. If there really is concern that he committed suicide, the reasoning behind it [shouldn't be simplified](http://www.samaritans.org/media-centre/media-guidelines-reporting-suicide/advice-journalists-suicide-reporting-dos-and-donts), because it rarely straightforward. Your headline makes this worse... ""because his unemployment benefits were cut"".

2. The cause of death had nothing to do with the lack of food in his stomach, and there is no direct link to his benefits -- just speculation.

Edit: a commenter [in the other thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2c4ecq/diabetic_ex_soldier_dies_with_344_to_his_name/cjbxs3l) puts it better than me: 

&gt; Not your fault, but the Mirror article makes it seem as if his benefits were stopped after missing one meeting, but in fact he missed a string of meetings, and failed to sign on for a number of weeks, as well as refused to take part in various unpaid work schemes that he was placed on.

&gt;There is more to this story than simply the government being big old meanies and stopping someone's dole. This was a belligerent, argumentative man who failed to take his insulin, failed to reach out for financial support when he needed it, failed to attend unemployment benefit meetings and repeatedly failed to comply with the rules around receiving unemployment benefit.

&gt;To say ""they cut his benefits for missing an appointment"" is a gross oversimplification and not actually what happened. They cut his benefits for a number of different reasons, failing to sign on, on numerous occasions, was one of them.

&gt;They also make much of the fact that he was an ""ex-solider"". What they fail to mention is that he served 2 years in Northern Ireland when he was 16, then worked for BT for the 15 years after that. To call him an ""ex-solider"", while technically correct, is probably as misleading as calling him an ""ex-paperboy"". The army has no obligation to look after veterans who have been in private employment for 15 years. If you want to rail against someone, rail against BT for sacking him.",0,1406726898,null,0,false,0,cjbynxz,t3_2c4vw7,t1_cjbynxz,t3_2c4vw7,null,1434972947,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

Looks to be on his way out, unfortunately. I guess he was good enough when he needed him but if I remember correctly he didn't make a big impact towards end of last season. I mean... With the cup games and everything, I would still keep him, but he will not be good enough for us, if we REALLY want to go for it either in CL or PL.

Glen Johnson
 He is clearly past his best and has been for a season now. Unfortunate because he just suddenly went off the boil and never really recovered.
 Love him as a player, scored some wonderful goals, but he's at a age were you either make it(Like Ashley Cole) or you get transferred.

Few young players probably will be sold either this summer or next, the likes of Kelly, Borini, Coates... I'm sure there are few more.
 Kelly was so promising, I hoe he stays for another season, but it might be too late for him. You'll never know.

I personally would keep all the players I mentioned, if the wages can be balanced out and play them in Cups. If they improve, keep them, if not then just sell and replace or let somebody from the youth system take their place.

This season is going to be tricky, because you don't want to really sell just yet, because you don't really know how the squad will respond to all of those games.

As a point of order, no cash ISA is going to look after you particularly well (from memory).

In terms of midfield we have alot of options, but accomodating them all will be hard. Wanyama, Cork, JWP, Davis, tadic, Ramirez are all great players and im fairly happy with these. 

Upfront we need pelle to perform, and if we do manage to keep J-rod then it will be great. Gallagher getting some sub appearances will do him good and maybe a new signing will come in to help. I was feeling very pessimistic a few days ago after chambers left and it looked like jrod and schneiderlin would be going but after looking over the squad and the new possible signing im a bit more optimistic and expect mid table.

I feel bad for Southampton, they're finally trying to put their foot down but players are now forcing moves. If we do get him I hope he's not a whiny big-headed little bitch like he has been the past couple days.

Oh fucking come off it. He's a professional football player, as are Bale, Modric, et al. He needs to do what is best for himself and his career. He knows exactly what he'll get at Spurs, and Southampton is a club that's asset stripping in preparation to sell the club. 

You need to realize these guys are professionals that have a very limited time to get as high as they can on the competitive ladder. If Schneiderlin wastes one more year at Southampton we will probably have gone for another CM (or ours will have come good), Everton and Arsenal will be stocked in that position, and then where will he go? There won't be much of a step up. Maybe Swansea if Saints get relegated? His time is now, and he needs to take this chance.

Besides, there is Saints ITK saying that he was promised a big move last year when he signed a new contract. And then last summer there was interest from big clubs that he declined because the board asked him to stay on one more year with the promise that he'd go next (this) summer. So they've gone back on promises to him multiple times. The board were reportedly okay with him leaving and Saints were discussing fees and terms until the Krueger came out with his statement yesterday, hence Schneiderlin's tweet.

I don't see any reason why we can't get Morgan, a quality LW and a CB. Then we're set. Joe Lewis is a billionaire (our owner). He's a multi billionaire. He's loaned to us before, do it now. Invest in us - we need that kick to get into the CL. J Rod isn't it. Draxler is. Isco on loan is. We're not the biggest club, but we need to show more ambition than J Rod (if i'm wrong, tell me otherwise). These other players raise our profile. Look at Bale and how he raised us.

Balanta at River for youth. Argentines wish he wasn't Colombian, and fully expect him to step up soon. Do we actually have scouts that aren't in Croatia? Get him in - he could be our Varane.

Balanta for me (I mean, FM) is naturally one of those players everyone says ''HURR DURR BALANTA FM BUY'' but no - River fans wish so hard he was Argentine. I was speaking to one about Lamela and he said he's certain/surprised if Balanta doesn't move to Europe this year. He's the real deal. 

I think Spurs should be looking at these young players. I know it's not ideal, and we're not a stepping stone (kinda), but players like Tielemans, Balanta, Praet, Batshuayi, Mitrovic, Calhanoglu, Obiang at Sampdoria, Firmino...would be awesome to get linked too.

true,vonbond,null,null,"&gt; First : What is the main thing university looks at ? Exam results ? Grades you got in school through the last year ?

I'll just talk about the first one as everyone else has done a good job of talking about the others and I have something to add on this topic.

There is no 'main' thing that a university looks at. If you are able to tell me which universities you are applying to, I can tell you the quirks of each one. 
UCAS applications provide four main areas of representations of merit:

-Personal statement

-Qualifications (up to and including predicted grades - all exams from school AND out of school)

-Teacher reference

-optional fourth: they might look at the kind of school you came from, your personal background and the kind of socioeconomic conditions. However, this is just for British students (but I thought I would keep it in as you never know who else is reading)

Of these areas, not all universities attach the same significance to each. Some, for instance, don't really look at the personal statement or set much store by it, because they know that rich kids have a lot of help writing them, and the kinds of things they put in are much more 'impressive' than others. Here's an example: one kid might have experience being in charge of cleaning up the common room at school. This is a big responsibility: he is relied upon by people, and he has volunteered to do this. A second student got work experience at her dad's stockbroking firm, where she 'made' £20,000 in profit in her first week. As a university, how do you distinguish between the two fairly? Some say, ""we really can't, and so we are going to discount ALL personal statements"", while others say ""ok, we'll take everything with a pinch of salt, and discount X, Y and Z"" (where XYZ are things like stockbroking or prefect duty or cleaning up common rooms).


Secondly, the teacher references. These are again rife with corruption: in the UK, an individual has the legal right to see references written about them. So a teacher can't say ""Johnny is a right little shit and I wouldn't let him anywhere near your institution if I were you"" because it's basically illegal. Instead, what you get is a lot of copying and pasting of things that end up in school reports, because state schools have sometimes 150 people in a year applying to university, and there are fewer staff. In richer independent schools, there are more teachers to go around and they can write more personalised statements. And they are less likely to be copied and pasted in a hotchpotch way.

So that leaves us with grades. Grades are important. In some ways, they are the only independently reliable source of information in the UCAS form, but again, that's up for debate. There's a whole lot of work going on about whether universities should accept the same level of achievement in exams from independent (private) schools than from public funded state schools (i.e. rich kid A has to get AAA while poorer kid B has to get AAB). It's a minefield of social and cultural class issues.

Anyway, this isn't particularly helpful to you, being from Lithuania, but at least you might have a better idea of what you're up against. I would advise you construct a really well-written and thoughtful personal statement, steering clear of ""I am passionate about xyz"" and ""I have been interested in xyz for as long as I can remember"" (where xyz is your subject) because every fucker does this. I would also advise you to work your arse off in your exams. I would finally advise that you write a little list of things that you're really proud of that you would like included in your reference from your teachers. People writing references sometimes like to have some things to go off, and it's good if your statement and their references match up. 

TL;DR UCAS is essentially a tool for showing up socioeconomic and class differences in the UK; nothing exists in a money-free vacuum.",0,1406730188,null,0,false,0,cjc02pz,t3_2buuhx,t1_cjc02pz,t1_cj95huz,null,1434973678,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

Bony would be an excellent second choice striker, but I suppose the prospect of playing second fiddle may not appeal to him so much.

In Remy's case, we'll probably have to overlook some medical issue a la Demba Ba in order to sign him. He's (relatively) cheap, a decent goalscorer, and seems to be interested in playing for a top 4 club.

Cavani seems unlikely, but he's apparently displeased with his situation in Paris and the media will surely see this as an opportunity to link him to us again. Personally, I think he's marginally better than Costa at best if you consider the transfer fees of both players. PSG will look to recoup all of the money they paid for him if he is to leave, which'll equate to nearly double what we paid for Costa.

Also ""overpopulation"" is a bit iffy as a genuine argument to make especially as our population projections see population peak at ~2050. Additionally the factors for ""overpopulation"" are linked to a lack of wealth.

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxford,"You're right, I shouldn't generalise.

Let me explain my view more clearly, even if you end up disagreeing anyway.

I think that it helps to make decisions on a subject, any subject, if one is experienced and knowledgeable in that subject. It is possible to *become* knowledgeable as necessary, but I think real long term experience can't be gained so easily and is just as invaluable.

In terms of making the government operate with more consideration to scientific evidence, I think that a person understands more about how science works and the value of peer review more when they have been subjected to it themselves.

Speaking about the general public, many people have a misunderstanding and sometimes a mistrust for Scientists and Doctors because they don't fully understand why the Scientists and Doctors come to their conclusions. They think that Scientists, like most others, have a personal agenda which can cloud their view and make them untrustworthy. Some Scientists and Doctors certainly have done that (e.g. the whole Anti-vaccine movement), but on the whole, peer review makes this very difficult to do. You don't realise how rigorous the scientific method really is, unless you're in it. And you don't realise how good it is at weeding out the bullshit, unless you see it doing just that.

So when we're talking about this committee, which is meant to act as the governmental advisor on matters of a Scientific nature, we are entrusting these people to first of all, find the right sources for scientific information, then to understand it enough to separate the credible from the incredible, and then to be able to form their own conclusions backed by evidence, convert it to policy recommendation and then sell that to the guys at the top.

There are only 11 people on the committee. So, out of all the MPs or other potential politicians they could have been chosen from, these 11 were deemed to be the best suited to this particular committee.

I don't know all that much about each member, but 2 of them we have heard about in recent news. Stringer is an avid ""climate change denier"" and Tredinnick a ""believer"" in astrology and homoeopathy and as having legitimate medical use.

Can these two be trusted to gather and consider scientific evidence and make an impartial decision as to what policies to suggest? Does it inspire confidence in you that almost 20% of the committee openly ignores well established science in favour of their own personally held beliefs?

For me, it does not. Even having one person like Stringer or Tredinnick on the committee is ridiculous to me. Having two means that something is seriously wrong with the way these committee members are chosen. That's why I question the suitability of the entire committee, not just these two. And that's why I am sorely disappointed with the level of prior experience I see on that list.",0,1406730913,null,0,false,0,cjc0f5c,t3_2c4nqk,t1_cjc0f5c,t1_cjbzgej,null,1434973840,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

However, I personally don't mind running red lights if there isn't any ambiguity about road traffic or pedestrian movements. My reasons are:

* It gives you a head start making your movements clearer to see and allows time and space to get in position.

* Allows you to reach cruising speed safely to lessen the relative speed between you and motorists.

* Save energy for more energetic burst rather than stopping and starting all the time. If you have a good bike and are in shape 25mph should be easily obtainable which can be key to travelling safely, I consider keeping this in reserve very important.

* Higher average speed often cools you more to prevent sweating. For commuters to work this is actually quite important because sweating often causes cyclists to cycle too slowly. 

The most dangerous thing about this is that motorist lose their minds and drive dangerously out of anger, otherwise it's certainly safer. 

Generally, I consider myself a hybrid pedestrian. If the red lights are that way for pedestrians to cross a junction, why can't a cyclist do so slowly as well. 

I don't see who this could possibly hurt; if it does hurt somebody it would likely hurt the cyclist more than anyone else!

You are misinformed on FGM, again there are several types, you keep describing a very severe infibulation which is something that happens mostly in Somalia and Sudan ( and must be undone before child birth as it puts both the mother and the baby in danger). More common forms, like the ones done an Indonesia (""sunnah"") remove very little living tissue, procedures that don't remove any tissue like the ritual nicking of the clitoris also fall under the umbrella of FGM and are banned.

true,lossaysswag,lfc12,,"&gt; I also don’t see why the club someone previously played for should define their potential. Southampton may not be fashionable, but you sense that if the exact same players were purchased from Udinese they’d instantly have more cachet. Although it’s true that you rarely find gems in lower divisions anymore, during Liverpool’s most successful period – 1977-1984 – they bought players from Coventry, Brighton (twice), Shamrock Rovers, Ayr United, Luton, Vancouver Whitecaps, Middlesbrough (three times), Chester, Home Farm, Hereford, Partick Thistle and St Mirren.

&gt; Was Graeme Souness limited to being a “Boro player”? Was Hansen a mere Partick Thistle player? It was a different era, obviously, but Bob Paisley, who bought better than any Liverpool manager, didn’t look to add “European Cup” players to his European Cup-winning sides.

true,sjampen,lfc99,,"Thats fair. Last season was similar, but I have some counterpoints:

First, it doesn't matter one bit for us, but both United and Tottenham had epic meltdowns. We don't have to feel sorry for them, but in my opinions, its incredible naive to think that both teams won't improve their seasons. The competition will get a lot tougher this year. 

Secondly, Luis Suarez. Can we just all agree how incredible he was last season? Not just his goals and assists. He won penalties, he made every single LFC player and did it while commanding constant double or triple attention from our opponent. Lallana is a decent player, dont get me wrong and obviously even if we signed Reus, Di Maria or Sanchez i doubt any of them would play as well as Luis did, but can we just agree that Lallana has a lesser chance that the others. Lambert is better than Aspas, sure, but will Lambert be the player that brings home the gold for Stevie? Are we really considering fucking Bertrand, how about Christian Poulsen and Koncescky, do we need them too?

Third, I feel theres is a lot of optimism, and i share a lot of it, but I can't help notice that theres a chance of the opposite happening. Will Raheem Sterling continue to grow as player? Will Studge score 20+ goals now that he is going to be the one defenders pay all their attention too? Was Hendo a monster this year because he was taking advantage of open spaces Suarez left when he drew opponents away? Will Coutinho keep getting better, cause we need him to create more assists now that Luis is gone? Will our defense magically get better this season? I'm not saying that our players suddenly become shite, but I can't jump on board with everyone thinking that they will become stars after the season they had, when the opposite could very well happen, they could regress.

But I think that the point for a lot of people is not purely nuclear power in and of itself, but more that there is a place that many Greens are coming from that is slightly anti-science, anti-rationalism etc. This is still a bit of an ad hominem, and it is growing less and less true as the party grows and professionalism. But I see where they're coming from.

My problem with them is more that, frankly, I'm just not that left wing. I'm in the Labour Party but always toyed with the idea of voting Lib Dem, I just always felt they were a faintly unserious party. I came of age when much Liberal Democrat membership was from the ""No to whatever New Labour is up to"" and ""Blair killed children in the Middle East"" brigade. I suspected that you invariably couldn't trust what they said because it was all about not being one of the other two, and in addition that they said what they liked because they didn't have a real shot at power in the short term.

But now I'm stuck in a party that thrives on being ""not the coalition"" but still not good getting across its idea of where the country should be (if they do have one) whereas the Lib Dems have been purged of all their unserious types by the coalition. I'll wait and see what happens next year I guess, and I'll campaign for Labour because regardless of all that, I don't want the Tories to win a majority.
