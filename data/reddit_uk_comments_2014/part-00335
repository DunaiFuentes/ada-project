Eyes...

Cybermen NEED to have a story where they stand on thire own.

Missy is merciless with the killing

The was a good bad buy plot but the episode plot more or less gave it no time.

Why do cybermen do things in sync? They need to be less Borg like. More human if anything.

Oh Danny. You were the best of men.

Did we really need UNIT? They were cool and all but it could have worked without them.

Loved they Cyber make-up though kind of Borg like again.(not a bad thing)

The fate of Missy? He/She will be back imo.

Nice twisting around the moral choices kept it interesting and work as the the main crux of the episode.

Cyber Brig spin-off?

Yes it was wrapped up nice and neat again but the solution worked for me.

What has happened to Gallifrey??? Everyone lies!

But it shows how bad The Doctor wants to get back home.

One last lie from Clara. A sad ending but a fitting one.

Overall a very good episode.

I need a re-watch they crammed a lot into the hour. I could List many more things but I wont I'll just enjoy the fact that this has been a very strong season (I may still like 5 best though)

Another way to look at this is that our midfield has been pretty terrible at linking up with the forwards.

I am so disappointed. How can you set up a finale so well with Dark Water and utterly let the hype down so badly? The scene was set. Everything was falling into place. The odds were stacked against them! What will the Doctor do to save the world this time!?

Nothing, turns out. Instead we got a terrible, bullshit resolution which involved Danny saving the day because we all know he had to at some point.

Some of the worst hurt for me comes from the fact that BOTH of the clips from the Next Time trailer for Dark Water were red herrings. The TARDIS key scene and ""Clara Oswald has never existed!"" made me really excited about the Missy-Clara connection and wondering what she meant. Turns out neither were what they looked like. Thanks Moffat.

Missy, though, was a great villain. She played the ""insane but cunning"" part very well; the scene where she killed Osgood was fucking terrifying and GOD FUCKING DAMMIT THOSE GUARDS ARE BRAINDEAD WHY WOULD YOU LET HER KILL OSGOOD SHE WAS A GOOD CHARACTER OH GOD WHYYY-

But really, UNIT has some very lackluster security protocols. Somehow they have no defenses on the plane, no escorts, and they flew through the Cyberman-pollen clouds. How fucking stupid can you get? They have the dangerous maniac who almost caused the destruction of the world twice in the last seven years and they leave her on the plane carrying the president of Earth, secured by a pair of handcuffs and two braindead guards, with Osgood doing science on a laptop four meters away. For god's sake, the Master himself guarded the Doctor better during both Last of the Time Lords and The End of Time. None of that makes sense.

I was so fucking mad when they killed Missy at the end because you know it's impossible to keep a villain around longer than the end of an episode once they've been defeated. Fuck that, I wanted the Doctor to travel around with her for a while, goddammit. That would have been awesome.

THIS was good as it focused on the Doctor, not the companion for once in New Who. Missy KNEW exactly what the Doctor is and what he's running from, and she threw that directly at him to basically cripple him in a bad state of mind and twist him into the person he's quite capable of becoming, as she said 'she wanted her friend back'.

Added to that it was a great Master arc, as Simm's version he was just crazy for the sake of being crazy, to the point you couldn't take him seriously and the plots were just bad because of it. As Missy however this was more in line with the classic Master, yes still 'a loon' carrying over Simm's traits but she was cleaver and weaved her way into the background choosing her fights, like paring up Clara and the Doctor which can be seen as her 'saving' the Doctor from the Great Inteligence  because if it wasn't for her giving Clara the Doctor's number Clara would have never saved the Doctor all those times by stepping into the timestream of the Doctor.

Also she was good at selecting when to strike by picking up the Doctor's 'collateral damage' when they die, thus also playing on the Doctor's guilt so she thinks that the Doctor will try and 'save' them by not killing them outright when he took control of the Cybermen. Her actions were evil and about the control and minipulation of her 'prey', that's what made her a great Master.

Nothing was explained - Why isn't Danny concerned that he's asking Clara to turn him into a cyberman? Why didn't the emotion inhibitor affect him, even though it affects all other cybermen? Did Danny know this beforehand? How? Why, after being told she's going to get killed by her prisoner, didn't Osgood check Missy's restraints and warn the guards? Why did the guards have a whole 5-10 seconds to react, but remain in the same poses they were before The Master got free? How is the Master back anyway? Why did the Master need Clara for her plans, and why were those plans tenuous/incoherent at best (and doomed to fail at worst)? Why did ~~love~~ deus ex machina save the day, when the writers have had twelve episodes to develop Clara and Danny's relationship, but most of that development happened off screen?

I wouldn't mind all of that, though, if so many of the characters (I'm looking at you Osgood and guards) weren't such blithering idiots. I'm starting to suspect it's a way for the writers to create tension, but good writers don't need to write stupid characters.

Like Gordan Stachan said recently, as a manager you're very careful of saying things that the media will use against you, as they're constantly trying to catch people out. When managers are winning they don't need to worry, the media will spin anything Mourinho says into a positive for him, because he's winning and under no pressure. But when a manager like Rodgers is under pressure, they will spin any slightly-controversial thing he says.

&gt;So £700 million isn't a lot to you? 

The £700 million was the DfT estimate, if all the road signs were replaced. However only old signs that have deteriorated past their ""use by date"" need be replaced, as they would be anyway, and newer signs can be changed, by placing adhesive vinyl decals, over the old numbers and abbreviations. If this was done the estimated cost is between 350 to 400 million. That's still a significant cost but keep in mind that it's a ""one of cost""and to give some perspective is less than 3% of the annual DfT budget. If the change occurs over more than one year, which is likely, the costs are further reduced.

The cost is not the reason for not changing. The reason for not changing is political hesitation and a lack of political willpower.

I disagree it was a bad episode if you take into account the series is still a drama based around a Timelord who travels in Time and Space, not every ending must be a happy one not every story must focus on the 'event' at hand.

THIS was good as it focused on the Doctor, not the companion for once in New Who. Missy KNEW exactly what the Doctor is and what he's running from, and she threw that directly at him to basically cripple him in a bad state of mind and twist him into the person he's quite capable of becoming, as she said 'she wanted her friend back'.

Added to that it was a great Master arc, as Simm's version he was just crazy for the sake of being crazy, to the point you couldn't take him seriously and the plots were just bad because of it. As Missy however this was more in line with the classic Master, yes still 'a loon' carrying over Simm's traits but she was cleaver and weaved her way into the background choosing her fights, like paring up Clara and the Doctor which can be seen as her 'saving' the Doctor from the Great Inteligence because if it wasn't for her giving Clara the Doctor's number Clara would have never saved the Doctor all those times by stepping into the timestream of the Doctor.

Also she was good at selecting when to strike by picking up the Doctor's 'collateral damage' when they die, thus also playing on the Doctor's guilt so she thinks that the Doctor will try and 'save' them by not killing them outright when he took control of the Cybermen. Her actions were evil and about the control and minipulation of her 'prey', that's what made her a great Master.

Like I said I think people forget sometimes it's not about the adventure but about the people involved, this series was more about the Doctor's true state of mind and his impact on others when he's showing his 'true self'. The Doctor is not 'nice' or 'our friend' who we are mean to always like, if you remember he only warmed up to his companions after a while but original he was quite cold to them. The 1st, 6th, and 9th Doctors all looked down on their companions (and even the Human race) at first but only really warmed up to them when they did something exceptional and 'beyond Human' - this series reminds us of that, and people don't like it, as he said 'he's not a good man, nor is he a bad one', he just is who he is.

For the episode if you take into account RTD's 'attempts' at the Master and doing an ep 'reflecting the Doctor's 'soul'' (aka Davros cheese) this still comes out on top",0,1415485559,null,0,1415485891,0,clwy6cx,t3_2lpgwc,t1_clwy6cx,t3_2lpgwc,null,1426122639,11,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,11

How did they not hear Missy explicitly state that she was going to kill Osgood? AND HOW DID THEY NOT SEE THE HANDCUFFS? WHY WERE THEY THERE?!

Once again LOVE PREVAILS is the solution. Really? So the emotional inhibitor did nothing but made Danny talk in a monotone voice then, basically. That is, until he starts his speech. I'm surprised Danny and Clara didn't live happily ever after with Clara as a Cyberman, a la Love and Monsters. 

And Missy just stood aside the whole time watching! Not even trying to prevent Danny! Even if you were confident it wouldn't work you'd still try to stop it surely.

The end of Clara and Danny was so reminiscent of Doomsday it was unreal. Even the name calling waking Clara up. Was that intentional, or purely unoriginal?

Does/did Danny exist to give snide speeches. He was a speech machine (excuse the pun). 
All he ever did was give speeches, talk about being a soldier and give off an abusive relationship vibe of creepiness. 
Although that's probably because he killed a child.

1. Moffat said we would find out what the connection is with Pompeii Capaldi...

2. They didn't explain well enough how the master got out of the other dimension Gallifrey.

3. Zero fucking motive to why Missy paired Clara with the Doctor...

The last episode was great it was really building up to something but this episode was so damn anti climatic.  I how the last episode left us hanging on if Pink would press the delete button. Yet in the next episode he's clearly already talked to the kid (who we only saw a reflection of at the very last second in the last episode) and seems to have made his decision not to delete his emotions. 

The guards guarding Missy were absolutely useless... they could have resolved these issues with some clever diversion tactics on Missys part but nope, she just takes her handcuffs of with both guards clearly in view. Then when she is talking to four eyes they don't even flinch as she gets closer or even after shes run over to four eyes after shes uncuffed her self. They could have made this whole scene make a tiny bit more sense if they were already dead or something and all she had to do was snap her fingers and they would collapse but nope, they were simply blind.

I hated how they gave Pink one chance to come back, wtf was that all about? So Heaven is now a dimension? I know this scene explains slightly why Missy was able to get out of the other dimension but it's done in such a quick manner I had to go back and check that scene just before wrote this paragraph.

Clara was odd in this episode, hated her at the beginning with the whole acting as the Doctor bit. She did seem to be better acted and written nearer to the end. Danny Pinks prosthetics were pretty cool but that damn speech at the end was cheesy as fuck. Capaldis performance was great as always and we can only hope his next season is much better than this one which was a rollercoaster of quality. Missy was fantastic as the Master and I will be incredibly pissed of if the next time we see the Master it's a new actor.

Doctor Who Finales are supposed to answer questions but this one didn't answer a single one. How did missy get away? Does she have a TARDIS? Why did she pair the Doctor and Clara? What happens to the Gallifreyan Hard Drive? 

This episode would have been a perfect way to kill off a companion in the new generation of Doctor who. Clearly Moffat chose Capaldi to be a very angry Doctor and what is more rage inducing than losing your best friend. This could have lead to the episode ending an a very very dark note with the doctor killing Missy or something leaving everyone wondering wtf just happened and wondering where the show will go next. 

Instead we get the Doctor lying about finding Galifrey where we see him get incredibly pisssed of as his hopes a dashed. This could have been an alright note to end it on with him and Clara parting ways but nope.

1 Absolutely nothing stops Clara from becoming a companion again. She's changed her mind about this plenty plus she has the doctor's/tardis phone number. But she didn't sign on for another season. At least with Donna she would basically die if she remembered anything. 


2. When the doctor says Danny found that there's a way back. A way back from where?!  Is there some sort of after life in another pocket universe. Why did he never mention that before and tell Danny that he can still come back to Clara. 


3. What's positive about just telling the doctor Danny didn't come back but he wants me to bring this kid back to his parents. But after we bring him back I don't want to be a companion anymore.  Wouldn't Clara want to do the last thing that Danny told her to do. Now without the doctor it's going to be 100% harder to find the kids parents. Doing what she did accomplishes nothing.


4. Why bring Clara to a huge cemetery. I could see it being semi acceptable if she was lying in front of Danny's future headstone. The plot didn't even need Danny to be near cybermen since he controlled them all with the magical bracelet. 


5. ""love isn't an emotion it's a promise"" try telling that to rose's dad from the alternate universe. 


6.what the hell did the cybermen even do?  There wasn't a single on screen death via cyberman, wouldn't that speed up the whole conversion process up quite a bit? Instead in the cemetery they all just stand there. 


7. Since all the dead people went to another after life thing technically if the doctor ever found it we could have Amy, Rory and Danny. [Note : I do understand the actors aren't signed on to do more episodes, just in the story itself it doesn't make sense why this wouldn't happen. 


8. Did the master just die in the end? It looked like she got shot by a cybermen. But what really bugs me is the doctor's reaction.  He went from don't kill her! to oh,  okay that happend. 


9. Why wouldn't Clara ask the doctor is she can sink her hands into the tardis again and look for Danny since he's kind of alive mabye. They did it before with 3w and it worked. 


10. (just thought of this) why doesn't the doctor think of galifrey sink his hands into the tardis and go there. The master got out so he must be able to get in.

Doctor Who has a tradition with their 2 parters where the 1st episode is always better than the 2nd. This is no exception.

When the plane went down, so did this episode.

Those guards on said plane were excellent..........their ability in protection and defence killed it..........cough....

Missy was the best villain this show has ever had. Reminded me of Loki and the Joker...no sarcasm.

How did that guy in the morgue not notice water flooding in?!

Why did Danny not have a fully functioning cyber suit in the first place?

I absolutely hated the fact that Danny beat the ""no emotions"" thing by just having a strong LOVE emotion!

Danny had MAIN CHARACTER LOGIC IMMUNITY.

Clara and Danny was the worst thing of this episode.

I never felt their relationship and so had no feelings for them in any scene.

Now Missy's dead (which was idiotic), they are now going to have to deus ex machina her back to life which just makes more poor writing.

Throughout this season, I've liked the Doctor more and Clara less and now hope she and her boyfriend never returns to this show.

The kid returning at the end was as cheesy as Maeve's sister returning.

At least no one in the street remembered the cybermen when they, I don't know, appeared in ghost form and invaded everyone's homes.

He said that most cities have a 'little India' where all the Indians live and work, and he wanted to visit Londons. So I thought about it, wondering why we don't have that in London and realised its because Indians and South Asians are so integrated into our culture they don't have the need for their own area. You can find Indian restaurants in every small town, and Indian food in all of our supermarkets, things like samosas, paneer, ghee, etc etc. We've got homegrown Bollywood stars, Bollywood screenings in the cinemas and Bhangra songs, Asian fusion music etc etc.

Saying that though there are some large concentrations of Indians in London in Ealing and in Tooting, so if you want to sample some British Indian culture then head for there.

Here's the Wikipedia page about Indians in London to give you some more background: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_community_of_London

* UNIT has managed to make every single person around st pauls a trained plain clothes officer with a gun, because they received a tip off (quite a drastic action, isn’t it?)

* rain somehow turns bodies inside sealed compartments inside a completely dry morgue into cybermen

* the doctor is the president of the world

* danny saves clara and takes her to a graveyard full of cybermen for no real reson

* danny would rather become an emotionless killer than kill himself. But in the end he just becomes emotionless (endangering clara) and then also kills himself

* danny has his emotions stripped but still has emotions

* brigadier is a cyberman but still has emotions and free will

* rather than save himself, danny sent a boy who died several years ago - to a completely new country, with no one he knew, no knowledge of english (at least, he shouldn’t have had), to a new time

* danny seemed like he was leading up to being an interesting character earlier in the series - who / why was orson pink. nope, danny had one feature as a character - he is a soldier who does soldier things despite not wanting to be a soldier

Metric is the international language of measurement. Every country uses metric. Only a few use Imperial, which is in decline.

In any case, the defending is the area you can't make any excuses for. It really is just terrible. I haven't seen us be so poor at the back for a while.

---

&gt;

&gt;__Chekhov's gun__ is a [dramatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama) principle that requires every element in a narrative be necessary and irreplaceable, and that everything else be removed.   

&gt;Remove everything that has no relevance to the story. If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off. If it's not going to be fired, it shouldn't be hanging there.

&gt;Variations on the statement include:

&gt;


&gt;* ""One must never place a loaded rifle on the stage if it isn't going to go off. It's wrong to make promises you don't mean to keep."" Chekhov, letter to Aleksandr Semenovich Lazarev (pseudonym of A. S. Gruzinsky), 1 November 1889.    Here the ""gun"" is a monologue that Chekhov deemed superfluous and unrelated to the rest of the play.

&gt;* ""If in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall, then in the following one it should be fired. Otherwise don't put it there."" From Gurlyand's *Reminiscences of A. P. Chekhov*, in *Teatr i iskusstvo* 1904, No. 28, 11 July, p. 521.

That said, every scene with Missy was brilliant (especially her Mary Poppins moment there) and the Doctor doing his 'James Bond plummeting through the sky' bit was great, if just for the score that went with it. 

As per usual, I'm peeved that they decided to off the main villain in the same episode. It annoyed me when they did it with Davros and back in the Tennant era and it still annoys me now.

He didn't lose his family, they were burnt out. We all have stories like that. My Grandmother visits France regularly to visit the grave of her brother who died in WW2 wearing the British Army's uniform. She does not wear a poppy.

O'Neill chooses to wear the poppy, that's up to him.

Serious question: do you think a person should have a choice whether or not they should wear the poppy? And if they choose not to, should they be made to explain their actions?

Because that is not really freedom. It is, as John Snow calls it, ""poppy fascism"". That phrase was made to seem especially appropriate when Charlene White, a newsreader on ITV London, was subjected to death threats and racist abuse calling her a ""black cunt"" and being told to ""fuck off home"" because she prefers to maintain what she describes as a ""neutral"" appearance on screen.

So this is where we are. We ostensibly have the choice, and Martin O'Neill chooses to wear one, and his choice to wear one is seen as commendable. But if he chooses not to wear one he will almost certainly receive the abuse Snow, McClean and White have received and are receiving. Death threats to him and his family are entirely possible.

So does O'Neill support the poppy appeal, or is he just wearing it for an easy life? There's no way of knowing, because in reality it is not a free choice.",0,1415487336,null,0,1415487656,0,clwyya6,t3_2lnq54,t1_clwyya6,t1_clwvxj2,null,1426122278,4,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,4

2. Judging from the Dubai visit, this took place years ago because why the hell would an owner of any franchise be giving away an shirt that's a few years old? I dismiss that entirely on the basis of that shirt; it's not current, it's not 'vintage', it's not from any memorable event (ie: Gerrard Champions League winning shirt), it's not even signed. More important questions are (but not limited to): What evidence does anyone have that this even took place in Dubai? Do the powers that be have any other business in their large nest of sports ventures that relate to Dubai, or this person? Does my milk expire today, or tomorrow? Do I know who that is in the photo holding the shirt? Has every webpage containing this single image that I'm speculating this far on also discuss potential naming rights deals in an fashion equally as vague as said image? Furthermore, they're posed for a media image, do we have a source containing this image from someone that isn't just a journalist? I don't know specifically, but among the first places I'd look at those that report to the public on behalf of the people in the image, and not Twitter in general or a news site. One could also just perform a thorough search on the image and see how far back the origins can be traced, a reverse image search sorted by date could yield some pretty instantaneous debunking. If you find that image uploaded somewhere in 2010, prettymuch everyone can just stfu about it. Frankly, I should have spent the time I'm spending here writing this just doing that and posting it. Another *shrug*.

5. When we're winning, I'd say it's because of the man you're questioning's tactics and the quality of our players. ""Even though Suarez isn't playing"" is a single minded approach and you could say that about any past player at any time. We've won matches after Xabi left, doesn't mean anything relevant starts with ""Even though Xabi isn't playing, the midfield..."". Last season was different, because we had a different set of fixtures, some players here and there, different injuries, different goals, we can really leave it at ""last season was different"" for the most part. Define how you find BR different before speculating on the reasons why he *is* different. The more realistically you define those things, the less you'll speculate as to the reasons. Much of the last part of that paragraph is..really..difficult..to follow; I'm not really sure what sort of management/contract things relating to BR is being reference or applied to the squad/results.

She's fucking evil and she loves it, but under that she *just wants her friend back.* I won't deny that I felt for the character when she said that. It's been evident throughout the Master's entire history that he still regards the Doctor as a friend... well, like a frienemy, maybe. But it's never been outright stated.

I liked Danny's motivational speech. Sure, it was a little clunky, but I imagine that more than a few people in the crowd of cybercorpses were in the same predicament he was. You could see a lot of them in the background as Clara passed just standing there listlessly, or pacing on the spot, or whatever. Then they have their motor control taken away by a bit of tech. All this after waking up dead and crawling out of their graves. Pretty horrific. As a soldier Danny recognised that a strongly motivational pep-talk might be the only thing to get them to snap out of their funk and do what needed to be done.

Re: the inhibitor apparently not working, well, that's not new. Craig's failed when he heard his kid crying and it's been established at other times that if you're feeling a very strong emotion at the time it's switched on, the efficacy goes way down.

Danny's face reveal was... dark. And messed-up. Holy hell, I was not expecting that at all. Hit me right in the feels. I mean shit, can you think of anything more awful and screwed up than that, for both the people involved?

The Doctor smashing up the TARDIS console was brilliantly dark also. I've been wondering when we'd see him reach his breaking point. Where does he go from here?

I'm amused by all the people who were expecting every single question to be answered. Let me ask you something: when has Moffat ever given us all the answers that quickly and easily? It took until the 11th Doctor's last episode until we found out why the TARDIS exploded all the way back in his first season; you don't think they'd show Gallifrey being saved in the 50th and then give it a reveal less than a year later, do you?

Costa was at his physical best at Anfield
Diego Costa walked into ­Chelsea’s training complex for the first time, summoned Oscar and instructed him to round up the three toughest players.

&gt; Dutifully, Oscar wandered off and returned with John Terry, Branislav Ivanovic and Gary Cahill.

&gt; Costa speaks little to no English but had decided to learn a line of introduction, parrot-fashion.

&gt; Slightly bemused, Terry, Cahill and Ivanovic looked on as Costa raised his fists towards them and growled: “I go into battle. You come with me.”

I can't argue with this - we played fantastic football last season and had one of the strongest first XI in the league, if not Europe. 

That said, I'm starting to doubt whether other managers might not have done similarly well with a squad that included Gerrard, Sterling and Suarez. Sturridge and Coutinho were quality purchases, not sure whether you can credit them to Rodgers or elsewhere in the club, but I feel with the amount of talent we had going forward it really would have been hard for us to have *not* done well last season.

I'd say that Moyes now seems hard done by last season - he was doing the best he could with an incredibly ropey squad and LvG hasn't managed to do all that much better yet even after heavy spending in the summer. Moyes had a squad that he was never going to bring any success wtih. In an opposite sense, I do kind of start to wonder now if Rodgers just ended up with a squad where it would be hard to have *not* had a reasonable amount of success with it. 

I still back Rodgers, and I hope I'm wrong in what I'm starting to suspect, but I do feel when you really think about it he's yet to really show that he's a world-class manager by getting the results when it matters. Time will tell really (at the very least I'm waiting until Sturridge is fit), he's not stayed at a single club for long enough to really have a team he can properly claim is his own.

And yeah I'm just vastly disappointed by the unanswered Master questions.  I want to know her backstory.  How, why, and when did she come back?  What was the last event in her timestream- the Sound of Drums arc, or the 50th arc?  

Also why didn't the Doctor even try to save anyone on the plane as it was obviously crashing around him?  He could have evacuated the plane onto the TARDIS at any moment - or even before they took off.  

And why were so many good characters just suddenly killed off?  Well maybe not that many, but it did seem like people were killed off pretty casually, particularly Osgood (and I don't think it was ever explained why her name is so oddly similar to Clara's).  

Maybe I'm just starting to get a little too old for the show, or maybe my expectations were just a bit too high.  But so much about this episode was disappointing that it's a bit hard to find the good in it.  

I agree that Michelle was pretty good, but that too came off as a wasted opportunity.  There was a lot of buildup to the ""I really just want you back as a friend"" moment, and then nothing was done with it.  It's always been the Doctor's rule to seek redemption.  The 50th made such a big deal of his refusal to kill.  Is 12 really so different that he can just abandon that in a moment?  Change course after millennia of saving even the villains?

Yes because all rules that exist - and have ever existed - are completely rational and thus should never be adjusted or removed.

Yes because all the people involved in the pedophile rings had to get their children at Falconry centres across the UK.

Well thank god that you've done your research. We should just refer to your groundbreaking research when addressing issues of child protection in the future. If *only* you had been around earlier than 7 years ago, we could have saved so many Irish Catholic children and so many more of Saville's victims. No doubt they were all picked up in falconry parks, of course.

It would have been an incredibly dangerous thing to do, given that the Cybermen would be driven by machine logic, and so they might decide to turn against humans (a well-explored theme in Sci-Fi literature &amp; media).

If someones is in command of the army, there is always the temptation to use it. Probably the best order, of a ""good man"", would have been to  order the army to self-destroy. But then, the Doctor admitted he wasn't a good man... and I think he was not lying when he told Missy ""You win.""

TARDIS became very complex, such as being a weird shape and having a more crowded feel, versus 9 and 10's TARDIS which felt very warm and simplistic. The sonic is my favourite example though.

false,InitiumNovum,irish,Ireland,"As someone from Ireland (the Republic), I personally think he's being completely immature about all this. Let's look at the numbers: 

More Irish people died in both World Wars than in the Troubles. During WW1, around 200,000 Irish from BOTH the unionist AND nationalist communities volunteered in the British Army and around 30,000-50,000 Irish people died from across the board. Lots of nationalists joined to fight in the British Army during WW1 because they thought that by doing so the British Government would honour them by insuring that the Home Rule Bill would pass (it was put on hold after WW1 broke out). 

In WW2, around 50,000 people from Northern Ireland joined up and a similar number of Irish Free State citizens volunteered in the British Amry, despite the fact that the Free State remained neutral. During WW2, an estimated 3,600 volunteers from the Irish Free State died and 3,900 soldiers from Northern Ireland died. Note again that these people came from BOTH nationalist and unionist communities. Also let's not ignore the fact that thousands of innocent civilians were killed (again from both the nationalist and unionist communities) during the Luftwaffe bombing raids on Belfast (which were some of the worst bombing raids in the UK outside of London). 

People from nationalist communities who fought during the World Wars were basically looked down on when the wars were over, nearly to the point of being ostracised by their communities. This was especially the case in the Irish Free State after WW2, some people even regarded these volunteers as traitors and failed to look at the bigger picture at the time. The problem was, the politicians who ran the Free State during WW2 and encouraged this sentiment, namely De Valera and Fianna Fáil, were anti-British to the point of being irrational about it. De Valera was the guy who helped start the Irish Civil War because he didn't want to accept the Anglo-Irish treaty (which was democratically passed) but eventually he gave in, he also sent condolences to the German ambassador after Hitler committed suicide (the only others to do that were the Japanese). 

Thankfully the Irish government is finally beginning to recognise the Irish dead and take part in remembrance ceremonies which they previously refused to attend because of nothing more than bitterness and historical ignorance.

James McClean is expressing the same sort of irrational uncompromising bitterness that has plagued the republican community, north and south, for generations. While the Bloody Sunday massacre was a big stain on the British Army's reputation and should be entirely condemned, when held up against the weight of history it ABSOLUTELY PALES IN COMPARISON when compared to the amount of Irish who died (both nationalist and unionist) when fighting for the British Army in the World Wars. Bloody Sunday is far from an excuse not to wear the poppy. It's nothing more than picking and choosing in order to make a political point rather than to actually show respect. What makes it even more a case of picking and choosing to make a political point is the fact that James McClean is a 25 year old who would've been very young when the Troubles ended, long after Bloody Sunday happened (which happened in 1972). I don't regard the fact that he is from Derry as being much of an excuse either. 

If anything, it is the nationalist/republican community who has made the poppy a polarising symbol, and I say that as someone who'd be from that community. Comparing the physical shadows cast by the gravestones of fallen Irish civilians and soldiers who died in both World Wars with those shadows cast by the gravestones of those who died in the Troubles, it is clear that the former cast the greatest shadows. The only other shadows in Northern Ireland are those which exist in the mind culminating in bitterness and are cast needlessly from one generation to the next.

Brendan Rodgers philosophy and the way be bangs on about it, is simply to pass it round the back with no penetration or pace whatsoever, playing Rodgers staple brand of football we are simply a mid table side and will not finish any higher.  His swansea team started to come good when he had them playing direct football with balls in behind the defence or sharp movements inside the penalty area with the defence sitting fairly deep -  THIS IS WHAT PERSUADED LIVERPOOL TO BUY HIM.  When he came to Liverpool he reinstalled his reading philosophy of pass it round for no point doing fuck all with no penetration and eventually cross it in for a small striker who has zero chance of scoring.  I don't see why he persists with this stupid idea as the team is 100% better when he ditches the possession game and plays with pace.  Now why we bought balotelli and lallana was obviously down to the fact that they fit rogers system, but that's not the best system for the rest of his personnel (joe Allen, lovren excluded) but you have to think, why the fuck do the club allow rogers to keep buying players which fit his formation and are genuinely shite in it.

Rogers should be made to stop playing this possession based bullshit and go back to the direct counter attacking style which made us like him in the first place and is proven to get results.
'But we are playing attractive football,' no we are simply winning to possession stats and wasting it by having no cutting edge whatsoever.
'But we don't have the personnel with sturridge out' 4-3-3 with borini up top with markovic and sterling either side.
'But markovic is shit and sterling is out of form AND borini is shit' markovic has those moments of magic which will help us win games, teams are afraid of his pace and he fits the system (running into space on the counter) plus as he begins to settle he will only get better.  Borini fits the system and makes run in behind, plus balotelli is shite don't want to see him in LFC colours again. And sterling because we know he has it in him, just needs to rediscover his early form and have some players alongside him.  
'Balotelli needs a chance to play up top with sturridge' I'm sure he will get it but doesn't change the fact he is shite, lazy, and lacks pace and end product.

As an international company we are extremely proud to support such a diverse workforce, and value the contribution of each and every member of staff. We do have a general policy in the UK stating that we carry out our working communication in English, such as when speaking to fellow employees on the shop floor. As a business we have to have this in place to help reduce misunderstandings and encourage the building of good relationships across the business and with customers.

It is a great asset for our business to have such a multi-lingual workforce, and one that we value and champion. We absolutely aim to empower and encourage any staff members to use their language skills to assist customers.

Equally, whilst staff are on their break, they are of course welcome to converse in their language of choice. We only ask that they consider their colleagues who may be sharing rest facilities at the same time.

Smoke and mirrors. 

I think it is great you're doing this, but you just sound like every other self serving politician. (From what I've read) These 'tax cuts for the poorest' are utter rubbish. We need to start seeing large businesses paying fair wages that don't end up being topped up by the government (tax money). 'zero hour contracts' have gone through the roof. And still we see no fair taxation on big firms doing business here. The middle are the ones getting the most unfair deal.

I've been in the 'poorest tax bracket' and I would rather see myself being taxed and getting better services and pay, than paying less or no tax and see national services being sold off for cheap to Westminsters friends.

I think whether you prefer pre or post series 5 depends on what style of show you prefer. If you prefer the drama / emotional aspect, pre series 5 trumps. If you prefer just the sci fi, go easy on the drama, post series 5 is for you. I really liked Smith's acting but I'm not fond of his writing. As I said, I prefer the writing style before series 5, so I really like Tennant. He was the perfect actor for the role. If you swapped Tennant and Smith (Smith the dramatic one, Tennant the *sillier* one) then I think they both wouldn't be very good.

Also be fair, it's not like Moffat was pure Blink quality, and RTD was certainly not pure Aliens of London quality. What I want to debate is, I absolutely love Donna's character. I think she was the best companion as far as character development goes. She was the much needed relief from the romantic tension of seasons 2 and 3, and she developed from a self doubting ordinary woman to a brilliant woman who changed the Doctor for the better, and her ending was in my opinion far and away the most well done and emotional.

The main protected characteristics are race, religion, sex, sexual preference and disability.

If I don't hire you because I only want white men in my organisation I've broken the law.

On another note, the old city (results wise) is back.

It's really obvious that our side is built around a couple of players and if these players are out by injury or form, we lack direction and cohesiveness. Watching the match last night made me wonder what the fuck Pellegrini has been doing in training. The players look like they're playing each other for the first time. 

The formation change may have contributed to the disjointedness but these Pellegrini should have had these players very familiar with this formation by now as 4231 is our 'plan B'. 

Poor performance last night but it's more the lack of that extra bit of motivation, which only Aguero showed out of our starting 11.

Regardless, they were two players that were also failing to meet expectations and he got the best out of both of them where several other managers couldn't.

Suarez is phenomenal and obviously the team was built around him. But turning those three under-performing players (not to mention Henderson too) around to being genuine title challengers all the while with a paper thin squad ('game changing double impact sub' options: Aspas, Moses, Alberto) is something I actually don't think a lot of managers could do.

Don't get me wrong I've expected much better this season too. After missing out on our seemingly only like-for-like 'Suarez replacement' target and now having our other main striker injured, we've ended up compromising our style massively.

I think once you start limiting the comparison to approximately like-for-like the correlation would be a lot weaker. 

Right now my main concern is that our poor performances are either because Rodgers is working the wrong system entirely, or because he doesn't have the players to fit his system. If it's the former, then it's on him to change and find the right system. If it's the latter, then you have to wonder why we've brought in players that don't fit his system. It's one thing for his first season in charge, but he's had multiple transfer windows now to get things how he wants them, and it's weird for us to take such a large step backwards even if we have lost SAS at the moment.

Exactly. Even playing Gerrard in a new role is in itself being adaptable/flexible. Some of his in-game management was superb last season too

His man management in bringing Henderson, Coutinho, Sturridge and arguably Sterling from under performing to near-title winning players is also being undervalued, because Suarez.

false,Apemazzle,null,null,"&gt; the similarities behind his behaviours are startling…

This is utter bollocks. The only vague similarities are the big spending in the summer, a few signings not settling, and maaaaybe Rodgers refusing to ""change his ways"".

On the subject of the signings, they haven't been totally shit - they've been a mixed bag; Lallana, Moreno, Manquillo and Can have all been pretty good, Markovic has shown a few flashes, and Balotelli and Lovren have been poor. Compare that to Summer '11 for instance, where Downing, Henderson, Adam and Coates were all poor (for a season anyway...), while only Enrique was good.

Finally, I know a lot of people are getting their knickers in a twist about Rodgers' insistence on playing Balotelli up front on his own, but it's ludicrous to extrapolate that he's a stubborn fool who never strays from his precious ""philosophy"". The only rigid part of his philosophy is keeping the ball and keeping it on the deck. Within those fundamentals he's extremely versatile tactically, and he has shown that many times in his time here. He's also shown that he's willing to rotate the squad and give fringe players a chance, so don't act surprised if Balotelli gets dropped once Sturridge comes back - or if he plays the two of them up front together like against Tottenham.",0,1415497163,null,0,false,0,clx3b7a,t3_2lpo1w,t1_clx3b7a,t3_2lpo1w,null,1426120230,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Missy's statement explaining how a Cyberman merely exploding would be absurd and unhelpful. 

Am I to assume that a Cyberman has more than one ability to explode and have entirely opposing outcomes?

That seems a bit lazy, in my view. Responses or rebuttals welcome.


The Cybermen Explode to create a cloud that (via nano-machines and/or other Cyber technologies) infect water (and its impurities within it) to then re-awaken dead individual's bodies, presumably taking the various materials within the vicinity, reassembling the material on the nuclear level to then assimilate the Cyberman outer casing, leaving, for whatever reason, the skeleton. Fine. It's science fiction.

HOWEVER, the explosion reaction of the Cybermen differing is bizarre, but maybe the 'orders' were altered. 

BUT, how did the clouds just 'vanish'?

While I'm at it, why were the entire oceans during the 'Forest of the Night' episode green? Am I to assume a plant life covered the entirety of the oceans with no hullabaloo from humanity collectively and all water crafts?

The Next Doctor - one of the lighter ones, but referenced in 11's first series as evidence of the crack in time. Also somewhat starts a Victorian era thing, albeit without Vastra, Jenny, and Strax.

The End of Time - Bringing back Gallifrey, Tennant's regeneration, bringing back the master after he was thought dead...this one was massive.

A Christmas Carol - This one was light-hearted, yeah, but it showed us more of the Doctor's personality. 

The Doctor, the Widow, and the Wardrobe - Light-hearted. Perhaps the only one with noo bearing on an overarching plot.

The Snowmen - brought back Clara, Victorian era again, introduces new companions after the demise of the old ones.

Time of the Doctor - Gallifrey, Smith's regeneration

It's all a bit of a con and I know there are plans to ensure a minimum speed guarantee is created but I dont think it's law yet. I used to be with Sky on an ""Up to 20mb"" package and pretty quickly noticed I was getting around 0.5-1mb average download speed.

Personally, I loved it...and then I started discussing it...and thinking about it more.  And, unfortunately, the more I thought about it, the more I noticed the cracks in the story and parts that were kind of crazy.  The bad kind of crazy.

For example: There's a now a *Cyberman Brigadier* out there that will **almost certainly never be addressed again**.  They brought the character back from the bloody dead (!!) and he survived through to the credits -- the guy is alive again and *still out there*.  

That's a problem.  Or rather, it **should** be, if the writers gave a damn.  

I mean, yes, the *scene* with him was *incredible*, and I was all sappy, and thought it was an amazing moment, as I was watching it... but the ramifications of that should be HUGE! 

Not to mention the untold billions and billions of people who were being held ""in the cloud"" after death. The religious implications alone should all but tear the world apart. 

These were actually really great sci-fi ideas -- but the show, with these writers, and this budget, REALLY isn't equipped to follow through on them. 

To be fair, I'm willing to concede that there are probably countless numbers of other episodes equally guilty of this, that I'm not taking into account, where they introduce some reality-shattering concept and ignore the consequences...

But an afterlife?  And most of Earth's dead defiled over the centuries, (presumably)?  These ideas deserve a better vehicle than a one-off finale episode.

****shrug****

Loved how they told each other happy lies at the end, though. Between losing Danny for good, and the Doctor's rage -- it was quite a beautiful, yet bittersweet ending. (My favorite kind.)

...and then they completely undermined it with the whole Santa Claus thing.

Eps 1 ,2 and 3 all felt like they had little holding the together except the recurring cast. Not much improved through to the end.

 The cast have been great but they seem seriously hampered by a writing staff who show no clear consensus on what the hell is going on from show to show. Capalid is brilliant with furious anger, but hes given nothing good to get furious at. Clara is brilliant with her original role being as smart as the doctor, but too often shes been forced into the frightened helpless female role.Danny pink was a fine second banana but he was draw so one dimensionally you cant see him if he stands side on. And Michelle Gomez did a wonderful bat shit insane Master, but was given such a futile and nonthreatening villain role with about 7 Deus ex machina per minute. 

 Some good bits, even great bits in places but I really do miss the clear epic story lines woven through a season from Russell T Davies. 

The best Doctor cast in quite some time has been squandered on some stories that have been obviously written to try and get wide approval from the nerd boys *and* the fan girls while I think its managed to be a let down for both.

The emotions have been melodrama worthy of Days of Our lives, the comedy has been on par with a Nickelodeon or Disney offering and the science has been on par with a Ken Hamm lecture.

The thing is he has strengths in other areas and if he recognized this it is not something which cannot be addressed if the right backroom staff are brought in. I remember Arsenal bringing Steve Bould into assistant manager role and noticed some positives as a result  and firmly believe we need to bring some experience in a similar role (not necessarily AM over Colin but you get the point).

I believe we will score more once we settle but if we continue to concede every game and have lapses and mistakes at the back it will all count for nought in the end sadly imo.",0,1415502538,null,0,false,0,clx5n55,t3_2lp72m,t1_clx5n55,t1_clx57fm,null,1426119140,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0

For me the master isn't about chaos and proving the doctor is actually the bad guy, he's about causing shit for the doctor to deal with because he doesn't like him.

The doctor ignoring Clara is the same lazy plot point used in every movie and TV programme ever where if you just listen to what people are trying to say you wouldn't have to go through so much hassle.

He's been mentioned quite a lot more than neccesary, I know he was a big character in the past, but everybody else who's died and been involved has had a mention, the brig has come up in 3 or four episodes and for me it feels quite shoehorned. If you bring him back today, why not any other companion who has died? Amy, Rory etc aren't gonna be happy cybermen.

In a 4-4-1-1, I would play with two wingers (probably Townsend on the left and Lennon/Chadli on the right), Eriksen in a centre midfield position (since he has been dropping deep a lot this year anyway) alongside Capoue or Mason, and then an auxiliary striker (either Lamela, Kane or Chadli depending on who we play up top).

It's basically encouraging two things - having a man play up near the striker in order to pick up knock downs, create linkup play and make overlapping runs - and width, which if Poch wants to persist with Adebayor, will play to his heading abilities and also hopefully prevent him from drifting wide so much himself.

I think Rodgers needs to put more faith in his teams attacking ability, even without S a S  , are we going to just keep holding on for a tie , and hoping a set piece works in the late game?

I do understand where you're coming from. If the story is good enough I **can** shrug off a lot.

That said, I'm from the mindset that if you put words to paper, you should make an effort to make the pieces make as much sense as possible.  TV shows and movies tend to have big set pieces in mind that will look great in the adverts, and then they'll write a story around those moments first, instead of having the scenes flow naturally from the story.

If I might cross sci-fi lines here: the new *Star Trek* flicks were particularly guilty of this. Great moments. Great effects. Very little thought put into the consequences of the writing.

In the most recent flick, for example they introduced (and used in both flicks) the technology to literally *beam people across the galaxy*.  

The first time they did it, it was a forgivable, near-miracle-level occurrence. 

I was willing, as a viewer, to write it off as something non-reproducible, and just enjoy the story.  

But then, referencing the event from the first flick, another character steals the idea and uses that technology AGAIN in the sequel.

As a viewer, I'm now in the position of noticing the crazy implications of this: you no longer need spaceships for traveling from planet to planet.  Exploration to the furthest reaches of the galaxy could now be done instantly.

Using the rules as written, as presented on-screen.

Sure, I COULD just dummy up and accept the pretty images on-screen, but unless there's a particularly compelling reason to do so (and the salute to the CyberBrigadier comes very close, I admit), I'm generally not willing to shut down **my** brain because the author of a piece was too lazy or shortsighted to use **theirs**.  :P",0,1415503812,null,0,false,0,clx665m,t3_2lpgwc,t1_clx665m,t1_clx570p,null,1426118838,9,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,9

Really, most of my favorite episodes were from Moffat before S05: Empty Child/Doctor Dances, Blink, Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead.

Even Season 5 I enjoyed. But with S06 and beyond, either he used his one good season idea or he's being pushed by outside sources in directions that just aren't good or enjoyable. I fear the show's success has also been its downfall - there seems to have been a lot of pandering to the lowest common denominator over the last 3-4 years: obvious statements to explain things that in seasons gone by were left to be figured out the hard way by the viewer, a bigger romantic focus on the Doctor's companions (either between them and the Doctor, or on bringing along other people).

This half-season finale has been one of the biggest offenders by far -- ""Permission to squee?"" Fuck off. Way to kill Pink by making him a cyberman and forcing Clara to engage the inhibitor. The finale didn't need to be two episodes, it just made it slow and dragged out. Maybe it wouldn't fit in a single episode, but it sure as hell didn't need two. I feel like I wasted over two hours of my life watching the Master acting crazy with no real end, Cybermen not really killing people, the Doctor not really fighting them at all, Clara crying and whining about the loss of her beloved, and UNIT standing around watching. The Santa reference at the end almost saw a remote through the screen.

IMDB may have a rating of 8.4, but of the people who actually wrote reviews there were 3: a 2, a 4, and an 8. That, rounded, is a 5/10. The other review linked gave a 4/5, but the comments I read are mixed.

I would argue that what's doing this is the stubbornness of these organisations in refusing to accept homosexual couples. Even without shutting these organisations down, if they are denying children homes with those couples, then they are taking away adoption services, and its the children who lose. 

&gt;Such agencies acted only to help

Wrong. An agency that acts *only* to help would not needlessly discriminate. 

&gt;think of the children argument.

As in, organisations that house children for adoption should be above the law to provide them a home, allowed to discriminate and pass on these shitty views, or to protect the kids from the eeeeeevil gays?

So, to start, we needed a new GK I think to at least challenge and preferably offload Mignolet as he was a bit of a hole.  We didn't get one.

Second, we needed to improve our defense.  Rodgers bought Lovren for that and fair enough, but he's not the side I feel we had issues with.  I would have bought a new RCB instead to compete against Skrtel who I personally think is a bigger problem and let Sakho+Agger be the LCBs as both are quite good already vs. only really having Skrtel and Toure/weaker side of Lovren as cover for RCB.

Third, we needed a LB better than Enrique.  On that, I say mission accomplished.

Fourth, I think we needed a better version of Gerrard (if you want to play that style) or Lucas (if you want a 'normal' CDM).  We really got neither, although I suppose some might argue Can is that guy as far as CDM goes.

Fifth and most importantly, we needed adequate replacement for Suarez.  Didn't have to be as good as that would have been impossible, but needed to be quasi-similar in terms of at least a few attributes.  Neither Lambert nor Balotelli fit the bill, sadly.

1) Yes, Missy gave him false hope, and my have had a larger plan to get to that location for some reason.  It did have the effect of really hurting the Doctor, hence the console beat up.

2) Clara was clearly in the preview for the Christmas episode.

3) Yes, we know exactly what Clara was.  Missy originally  hooked the Doctor and Clara up.  She ended up in the Doctor's time stream, which allowed versions of her to appear at different times in the Doctor's life, hence looking to be an impossible thing until 'The Name of the Doctor'.

4) Yes, Missy can regenerate.  It wasn't stated, but they haven't killed off the Master forever.  May be a long time, but we will see the Master again, I promise it.

5) Killing Osgood was a great idea.  That character was designed to reflect the fandom.

If people have a problem with how he's spent then the logical thing to do would not to be to sack him but instead change his role in the transfer committee.

Mason I think can fill his role relatively well, but it does leave us fairly lightweight in midfield.  Again, I would be completely willing to sacrifice defensive stability in deep midfield in order to have more attacking options up front.  At the very least, it will force our backs and CDM to pass the ball forward quickly, instead of bogging it down being passed side to side constantly.

And I never said anything about benching our two most effective players.  I never said Lennon should definitely start, but he would be in the mix.  He hasn't played terribly well of late, but he does offer pace, a high defensive workrate, and a greater ability to stay wide than any of our other potential players for wide right.  Chadli could easily play on the right, with Lamela behind Kane as the striker.  Nothing I said above precluded any of that.

It's not necessarily the most elegant of solutions, but are you really going to defend 4-2-3-1 as a viable proposition for us given our start to the season?  Any time we've played that formation, under either AVB or Poch, we've looked slow, devoid of creativity, lacked genuine pace and width, and struggled to create true goalscoring chances inside the box.

Unfortunately Southall isn't on the tube, but if you've got a Travelcard, you can use it to travel on the suburban national rail services as long as the route you're going stays within the zones that your travelcard is valid for. (This is particularly important if you're going to SE London as it's pretty much The Land The Tube Forgot) If you have a look at the [tube and rail map](http://www.tfl.gov.uk/maps/track) on the [Transport For London website](http://www.tfl.gov.uk/), Southall's in zone 4, so as long as you've got a zone 1-4 travelcard, then you wouldn't have to pay any extra to get there on the train. Or you could get the tube to Ealing Common or Ealing Broadway and then get the 207, 427 or 607 bus there, but it takes a lot longer, particularly in rush hour.

As far as other cultures go, as other people have mentioned, while London has a lot of different ethnicities dotted about, the concentrations tend to fluctuate as people prosper and move up, new groups arrive, and different areas become fashionable and unaffordable. For example, Brick Lane used to have a big Jewish community, and still has a couple of 24hr bagel bakeries, but since the Bangladeshi community arrived it's just as well known for its curry and balti houses. When I was a kid we used to go to the ""Italian Procession"" organised by [St Peter's Italian church](http://www.italianchurch.org.uk/Procession.html) in Clerkenwell, but I have no idea whether there's still a big italian presence round there. 

The big obvious ethnic area is Chinatown, which is centred on Gerrard Street, round the back of Leicester Square. Lots of nice cheap restaurants and nice expensive restaurants, and also the infamous Wong Kei's. I haven't been there for years, so I've no idea if the reputation is still deserved, but probably best not risked if it's going to be your only experience of chinese food here. There's also a load of Middle Eastern (Iranian? Lebanese?) restaurants and shisha cafes at the Marble Arch end of the Edgware road if you want to stay fairly central.

A bit further out, West London has had an established Polish community for years (there's a big Polish cultural centre in Hammersmith in classic 1960s concrete and glass) which has swelled in the last 10 years with the changes in the EU, so there's now also a lot of Polish delis, supermarkets and even a Polish medical centre. If you like hearty, filling meat and potato/cabbage/beetroot style grub, I can recommend [The Patio Restaurant](http://www.patiolondon.com/menu.htm) in Shepherds Bush - you will definitely know you've been fed, and it's perfect for the cold wet weather that seems to be on the horizon. Last time I was in we got offered a complementary shot of vodka at the end of the meal - I'm generaly not keen on vodka, but the Zubrowka (polish bison grass) vodka is nice.

TBH though, if you're happy to start with the food and work your way up from there, just go to yell.com and search for {nationality of your choice} restaurant in London, and narrow down by location if you get too many results. You can pretty much find anything if you don't mind travelling across town a bit.",0,1415507390,null,0,false,0,clx7n6o,t3_2lohgw,t1_clx7n6o,t1_clx49d5,null,1426118151,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

What I mean by this is that there is a reason so many fans will tell you David Tennant is a fantastic Doctor. Not only was he an exceptional actor for the character, but he had the cast, companions, and most importantly, the writing to back him up. I remember reading an article at the end of Smith's run that concluded ""he was fantastic, but at the end of the day, he deserved better."" 

Capaldi could be the same way if this lazy, unnecessarily convoluted, and anticlimactic writing keeps up. So much hype was put into the episode, yet I was left with so many questions about how this or that happened (Brigadier Cyberman, the cardboard-cutout guards, Danny's speech to robots, etc) that it immediately spiraled downward.

Even worse than that, not only does Capaldi's performance deserve better, but Gomez's does as well.

false,SpaceTimeConundrum,tardis,TARDIS,"I'd say **disappointed** is a pretty accurate description of my feelings about this episode, especially after a series that, on the whole, I found really enjoyable to watch.

**Major gripes:**

1) I know a bunch of people were thrilled with the Cyber!Brig, but I'm pissed off about it, even though it *did* make me cry. (The only thing in this episode to do so.) If Nicholas Courtney were still alive, I wouldn’t be as offended by it, but since he isn’t, it feels like a cheap emotional ploy and bad form, rather than a tribute. (It still would be even then, just less distasteful I guess?)

2) More blatant audience manipulation by killing Osgood after teasing companion-status - Moffat even *admits* to it in the extras. It was incredibly obvious, not good writing.

3) Danny's death. Or rather his near miss with resurrection / sacrifice to save the kid. I really liked Danny, but I strongly suspected they were going to make his death a permanent one, after the complaints about spontaneous character returns on prior series, so why not just make his big speech / flying off to save the world the end? 

4) The Cybermen were really not all that menacing in this episode, after such a solid, creepy into last week. Any real impact was swallowed whole by the rest of the action. It felt like a massive anti-climax despite the rousing speeches.

**Things I liked:**

1) Missy - she was pretty delightfully off-kilter in her performance, and OF COURSE the Master's plan was all to get the Doctor's attention and affection. (When *isn't* it?) Also, she's totally not dead, so please bring her back randomly, Ainley-style in the future.

2) Kate Stewart. You want to honor the Brig's memory properly? - let her come back and do competent things more often.

3) The Doctor's ""I am an idiot"" speech.

4) The Doctor's cheerful lie to Clara contrasted with his actual reaction to the Master's lie.

Thanks for those links! They'll come in real handy!

I was advised not to go to Brick Lane as people keep saying ""It's not what it used to be."" when talking about the food aspect. I think I'll still go to see what it's all about though. As for Clerkenwell, if I just happen to pass by I'll see into it. Chinatown sounds good, especially in a city like London so I'll try looking into that. As for Middle Eastern, I've never had it so I might try it. I don't mind going a bit out of the city, just as long as I don't have to hop on 4 buses and 3 trains to get back to my hotel, that's all haha. 

I've heard so much about Polish people in England haha. Hopefully the stereotypes against them aren't true as they are a lovely bunch of people, I'm sure. I'd love to see the Polish influence over there and will definitely see if I can fit the Patio Restaurant in as that meal sounds lovely! Plus, the possible shot of vodka? Even if I don't get one, sounds good enough of a restaurant to go to!

I think that Capaldi makes a wonderful Doctor and I really love his portrayal of our favourite time lord. 

I really liked this season as well I reckon I would give it a 8.5 and I thought it was much better than series 7.

I'll give you my thoughts on each episode:

Deep Breath: I quite enjoyed it. I thought there was a lot of fluff and unnecessary scenes but it really revved up towards the end and it was a great introduction to a new Doctor. 3/5

Into the Dalek: I really enjoyed this one. There was some awesome Dalek fighting scenes and it was great analysis of the Doctor's darker side. 4/5

Robot of Sherwood: I did not really enjoy this episode. There was lots of cheesy jokes and there was that stupid resolution to the story with the arrow. 2/5
 
Listen: Brilliant, I really enjoyed it. It was absolutely fantastic, there was some real scares and I love how open ended the episode was. 5/5

Time Heist: I really liked this episode, it had a really cool alien with an interesting world with a solid supporting cast. However, I thought the bank was little easy to crack into. 4/5

The Caretaker: This episode had a few good laughs but other than that it was pretty meh for me. 2/5

Kill the Moon: I found the Kill the Moon too fantasy rather than science fiction to actually suspend my belief. The moon being the egg was a bit ridiculous and the little girl was pointless and the spiders were not used to their full advantage. Although the fight between Clara and the Doctor was terrific at the end. 2/5

Mummy on the Orient Express: This was excellent and was terrific. Interesting supporting cast, interesting villain and the Doctor at his best. 5/5

Flatline: My favourite episode. The enemy was original and interesting, the characters were well defined, and the Doctor's speech at the end was so bad ass. 5/5

In the Forest of the Night: Was just pretty ordinary, I didn't find it very interesting and there wasn't really a threat. That scene at the end of the girl's sister coming back was stupid. 2/5

Dark Water/ Death in Heaven: Both parts were really terrific and were a good end to the series. I didn't see the reveal coming and there was actually some real consequences (Danny dying). Capaldi's performance was terrific and the scene where he rages was brilliant and tear jerky. The Cybermen were actually used really well here. I really enjoyed the new portrayal of the Master and thought it was spot on. 4.5/5 (Although were was the exploding TARDIS scene from the trailers I was really looking forward to that.)

There is still going to be time travel in and out of Gallifrey even if it's time locked. But it's travel that occurs independant of the time war. Travel that can only be instigated if one doesn't try to alter the time war.

Clara needed to go in, to grab the doctor and then give her speech. But if she had tried literally anything else, she would have changed the course of history to the point where the doctor didn't end up in a scenario where clara could go back in time in the first place.

The time lock would prevent people traveling into the time period with intentions of changing the scenario with knowledge post time war.

So any established time travel during the original duration of Gallifrey would still have to exist since it has a corresponding time outside of Gallifrey.

You can hand-wave it because he has no clue what it means to be a cyberman or that he has faith that his love isn't just an emotion, etc.

&gt; Why didn't the emotion inhibitor affect him, even though it affects all other cybermen? 

A lot of hand-waving here but they spell it out, the Doctor says that he was wrong because love isn't an emotion (or at least their love is so strong). Yes there's a lot of questions as far as does this mean no one who's ever been turned into a cyberman love someone, but they'll play it off that what Clara and Danny had was special and that she was right there with him when the switch was flipped.

&gt; Did Danny know this beforehand? How? 

All you need is love?

&gt; Why, after being told she's going to get killed by her prisoner, didn't Osgood check Missy's restraints and warn the guards? 

They didn't write this well they wanted her to die as fodder to anger the doctor and to give another loss, but it was sloppy, they portrayed her as smart and ""OCD."" If she had to die, she should have died in a way that was more of her following the rule to the letter or something.

&gt; Why did the guards have a whole 5-10 seconds to react, but remain in the same poses they were before The Master got free? 

They should have had them draw, I almost got the impression she moved inhumanly fast the way she slipped in behind Osgood.

&gt;How is the Master back anyway?

The Master. That's how. He's been killed pretty much every time and every time (s)he's come back, the last time they did something far more elaborate to explain his return but that's not common.

&gt; Why did the Master need Clara for her plans, and why were those plans tenuous/incoherent at best (and doomed to fail at worst)? 

Master Missy spelled that out, she needed someone that the Doctor would ""go to hell"" for. The goal was to show the doctor that he was no different than the Master/Missy and to do that you need to break his spirt, no better way to do that than through a companion.

&gt; Why did love deus ex machina save the day, when the writers have had twelve episodes to develop Clara and Danny's relationship, but most of that development happened off screen?

They've been doing a lot of off-screen development lately. Look at the Pond's relationship and how much time would jump between episodes.

The silence plotting against him. He got locked in a prison by every enemy he has ever faced. The crack in the wall when he met amy. Every step forward there was more enemies around him closing in until at last he had to call in his favors and then, he failed to save amys daughter.

Even after that was resolved he ends up at transalore where everyone is against him. He stood alone with nobody save for the head of a cyberman until Clara was able to show up. And then in battle he started his regeneration, used it as a weapon to bring down the Daleks, his oldest enemy.

9 was born from a war which devastated his people. Plagued with guilt because he thought he destroyed his people.

12 was LITERALLY born from a war though. The very regeneration that made him was used as a weapon. That alone says alot. But there is more I'd say.

in the first episode with 12 he says that he chose this face to tell him something. Something that he couldn't just say with words. This angry face was a message from himself.

1) I'm not entirely sure what you mean by this but the plan seemed to be that either the clouds would start infecting living people, too, or the Cybermen would just kill people and the clouds would convert them. Even if that weren't the case people are always going to die.

2) The Doctor probably wouldn't have cared in that case. There's no moral quandary to that. Failure to do something would result in billions of deaths so I doubt he'd really consider it objectionable or tempting in any way. Besides, the issue was more that he would use an army to enforce his will. In your scenario he's just stopping the bad guy's plan.

3) Yeah, that's not bad. I think it was more a sign of Missy's arrogance and misunderstanding of The Doctor's true nature. In her mind there was never a question of whether he would accept it or not. She assumed it was what he wanted so why bother doing all that?

Past seasons have been of variable quality, and they've all had a few ridiculous or outright awful moments. Or even entire episodes. But this was the first season where, with the exception of Jamie Mathieson's two amazing episodes (Mummy on the Orient Express and Flatline) *every* episode has been at best mediocre and at worst truly shark-jumping awful (Robin Hood, Kill the Moon, the trees episode come immediately to mind). Even Peter Capaldi's excellent performance has been unable to save it.

Not since the Trial Of A Time Lord season back in Colin Baker's day have I been more tempted to just walk away, and back then the Beeb was actively trying to kill the show. Then BBC executive Michael Grade [absolutely hated it](http://www.toplessrobot.com/2011/01/6_ways_the_sixth_doctor_from_doctor_who_got_screwe.php).

While I can admire Jemma Coleman's performance, I don't think much of this season's Clara. She's been too obnoxious and annoying to be sympathetic, and there has been too much emphasis on her instead of the Doctor. And I think this season's Clara's repeated slapping of the Doctor for no good reason, and her repeated threats of violence, are unforgivable.

Although the Doctor's line in Dark Waters about her betrayal was brilliantly written, and brought a tear to my eye, I didn't buy it. Clara Osborne in this season has not deserved the Doctor's forgiveness. Mourning for her lover or not, this wasn't a moment of bad judgement brought on by grief. She planned it ahead of time, and was prepared to utterly destroy the Doctor's life, stranding him in an active volcano, risking the entire space-time continuum, for the sake of her own selfish reasons.

Brilliantly done or not, it was stupid and out of character and I don't believe it. And yet we're supposed to forgive her, or believe that the Doctor would?

I think the emphasis on Clara and Danny Pink has been a distraction, and frankly it was done so much ~~better~~ more interestingly with Rose and Mikey. I've enjoyed seeing the Doctor be less of cuddly character and more arrogant and distant like a Time Lord should be, but it hasn't been anywhere near enough to save this from being a train wreck of a season.",0,1415517200,null,0,false,0,clxauld,t3_2lqjxf,t1_clxauld,t3_2lqjxf,null,1426116636,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

It would be amazing if Clara was the next regeneration, who went back in time to slog along with one of her previous regenerations and then picked up a companion and grafted her memories onto him, *just* so she could go incognito and figure out something that was bothering her about her prior regenerations.

This would totally redeem the series' sudden and sharp turn into 'How Great Clara Is (Featuring Her Pathetically Inferior Foil, The Doctor)', and Moffat would suddenly gain 100% of my respect if this is what he has been setting up with The Impossible Girl theme.""

The problem is not with these players, the problem is with a lack of defensive know how from anyone in the back 6. Migs isn't organising, Gerrard has no idea how to defend, the full backs are more like wingers than defenders, and Skrtel always looks much better with a natural leader with experience beside him (think Carra, Toure or even Agger).   

Personally I'd play Lucas every game because we look infinitely more solid with him in there.

The final graveyard scene. In fact, you can pick out the *line* that everyone will start to complain about.

""Love is not an emotion. It's a promise.""

Right then I almost gave up watching. And when you the line that has the most impact, the most gravitas, the line which is delivered at the height of a climax is a line as **SHIT** as that, the episode just…fails. Danny's speech didn't help either, but I've seen far more horrific DW series finale solutions ('Last of the Time Lords', anyone?).

And also, plot holes. So many I found that would easily give me trypohpobia. If Danny died, what about Orson? How did the Master survive from The End of Time? And much, much more.

false,Ky1arStern,null,null,"I think this season was kind of scattered in it's message/theme. I'm going to have to go back and watch it again, but I felt like overall it wasn't tied together very well.

Episode by episode it had some good and some bad. I really enjoyed Flatline, the one with the aliens that are never seen, the Mummy episode, the episode inside the Dalek and the finale. I thought all of those were well written. I wasn't as big a fan of the season opener, the forest, or Robin Hood. I run hot and cold on kill the moon. 

Overall I think the point of this story was to create a defining arc for Clara and to introduce the new Doctor, a man who is not a good man but is desperately trying to be. I constantly miss Matt Smith's doctor but I dont think it's fair to hold that against Capaldi's 12. 

In general I believe they've had trouble defining who Clara is, trying to keep her from being a classic Mary-Sue-spunky-full-of-sass-female-archetype. But I dont really know what they were doing instead. It was interesting to see her try to balance a normal life and life with the doctor, but we had already seen that with the Ponds. Likewise the love triangle presented a kind of interesting backdrop, but I dont think it was really fleshed out enough. The doctor I dont think really loves Clara romantically, but she's his best friend and he absolutely *needs* the attention. I feel like that got muddled.

There was no real resolution with Clara's arc. We meet her as this girl-out-of-time and then we find out that she had been trawling the Doctor's timeline saving his life. She helps him restore Gallifrey and watches as he lives out his days on Christmas. She's hands down his best friend but I still dont think she had good characterization outside her relationship with him. Enter a newer older doctor and she has to reconcile her previously romantic feelings versus this man who she doesn't even know if she can trust. Then she kind of uses him to break out of a life that is sooo banal when compared to her adventures. I think in a lot of ways we see her as something of an addict or an adrenaline junky, and the Doctor is her fix. I think, muddled messages and all, this would have been a fine arc for her if it *had some sort of resolution*. I think Danny needed to have been killed due to her adventure seeking, not as some sort of freak accident. Because the way things have ended, there's no completion of her arc, we can't see how she's changed except that she's become more guarded and closed off, much like the Doctor (specifically 11, who tended to play things very very close to the chest).

We walk away from this season seeing two people who are gift-of-the-magi-style walking away from one another. Clara lied to the Doctor because she didn't want to keep him from his people, and he lied to her because he was trying to help her settle down with Danny. That interaction I think showed the schism created when 11 regenerated because she can't trust him (As much as she wants too) and he doesn't trust himself so he pushes her away. It's a lot of very complex character-interactions that I feel have not been explored very well, and I think more than anything else that will leave a bad taste in people's mouthss regarding Clara. 

**TL;DR: I thought this season was fine but I think that it didn't create a satisfying and complete story arc for Clara.**

It actually builds on Clara's past as a nanny/governess/entertainment crew member. Clara's been a friendly companion to Smith's Doctor because they looked like they were the same age, and acted like the same age. In some way they were more equals and yes Smith's Doctor was a bit narcissistic, but I believe that was on Moffat. 

Now with Capaldi's Doctor, Clara actually was asked by the previous Doctor to take care of the new Doctor in episode one. Which is exactly what she did. Her role was more of a governess this season than a companion friend. Which makes me wonder, how much and how long has Moffat been planning this?

The only thing I didn't like about Clara's whole story arc was the mystery about her in the beginning (Why are there so many Clara's?) and the 2nd mystery in this season (Who gave her the phone number to the TARDIS?), but that's classic Steven Moffat writing for you, I hope he leaves that with the next companion, but so far, I think he's done well with Clara imho. (I mean, at least Clara never carried a sex toy for the Doctor).

And on the Doctor, this is his new regeneration, also in a new cycle, this season has done very well to build him up for the next season. I really really really enjoy Capaldi's Doctor and I am hoping the next season will be more Capaldi centric too, but yeah, switching up your main actor is always a bit risky and the way they played it was very safe and nice.

As for why most Time Lords/Ladies do not gender switch, let me tell you my theory: they don't want to. Every one of us has a ""gender identity"" in our minds, which is not the same thing as our physical sex. You really, really don't want to be in a body that doesn't match your gender identity, but you probably don't realise it, because they probably do match. In fact, if you're like most people, you probably assumed they're the same thing, and you'll just identify as whatever you grew up with, the same as football teams or favourite foods. But you'd notice the difference if your body was suddenly the wrong sex. You'd want it to change back, and it's not a feeling that would go away.

In the case of humans of course, this is more than my silly theory, it's an empirically verified fact. But for time lords, it is the best explanation I can see for why they mostly stay the same gender, as well as being what gender actually *is*, as far as we understand it. Of course, Moffat would rather hand-wave it and ignore what gender is because he doesn't want to think about it. Which is a shame.

""Bloodsoaked/Clara use the screwdriver so the Doctor can keep his hands clean"". As if Danny Pink the Soldier wasn't just shown murdering a child in the last episode. He should know the atrocities of war first hand, but no, he guilt trips Clara and takes some pretentious high ground whenever he sees the Doctor.

""Clara watch this, this is who the Doctor is"" as if he has ANY idea who the Doctor is outside of his personal, immature jealousy. All the while keeping Clara in a ""it's me or him"" ultimatum. After watching him sabotage and poison Clara and the Doctor's relationship this entire season, his ""redemption"" fell flat for me


Missy on the other hand. While I'm upset she nuked the asthmatic personal assistant (the ""time and space"" line was brilliant), I thought she was fantastic. Didn't like how they ended her, since I'm assuming she's coming back by way of teleport/regeneration. I would have preferred a more open ended ending, rather than an introduction to the Master last episode, then a definitive conclusion here, only to open it back up later. 

I didn't like how they just glazed over Missy bringing Clara to the Doctor. Or what the Netherslice was/is (I'm assuming next season but still)


The ending of Clara + Doctor was a good, yet tragic ending. The lie, the hug. I thought that was really well done.

 [**Suspension of disbelief**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension%20of%20disbelief): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;__Suspension of disbelief__ or __willing suspension of disbelief__ is a term coined in 1817 by the poet and aesthetic philosopher [Samuel Taylor Coleridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge), who suggested that if a writer could infuse a ""human interest and a semblance of truth"" into a fantastic tale, the reader would suspend judgement concerning the implausibility of the narrative. Suspension of disbelief often applies to fictional works of the action, comedy, fantasy, and horror genres. __Cognitive estrangement__ in fiction involves using a person's ignorance or lack of knowledge to promote suspension of disbelief.

When benefits are taken away from those least able to defend themselves, eg, the poorest in society and those with disabilities, it has an indirect impact on the overall society. Chronic joblessness is a whole topic in itself, especially when the jobs these people would have done historically have disappeared or been moved to China.

Nobody likes taxes except the government. It lowers economic output having high tax rates but without them we have a profoundly more unequal society, which in turn is a less resilient society. The free market doesn't work for the majority, so regulated free markets are the preference.

The NHS is facing cuts in *successful* hospitals to divert resources into *failing* hospitals under legislation passed by the coalition. I went on the marches to protest Jeremy Hunt's proposed cuts to Lewisham hospital, which were sort of successful. The NHS is still free at the point of care but who knows how long that will last.

Roads are about the same, yes.

Education is a tricky one, I don't think there has been a popular minister for education in the past 20 years. Kids are still being taught either way. Not that the curriciulum is up to much but it's better than nothing.

I agree that Labour under Blair and Brown did run things badly. I'm not a Labour supporter and probably won't be for at least another decade, if ever.

false,LordBrappington,null,null,"The correct response would have been as follows:

&gt; IN November 2010, Tony Blair flew into Beijing for a speech on globalisation. With the words of his faith foundation emblazoned behind him, he stressed that with so many opportunities to get rich there was an urgent need for “a sense of values, of principles, of things grounded in more than simply material advance”.
&gt; 
&gt; More than 8000km away aides at the former British prime minister’s consultancy, Tony Blair Associates, based in London, were putting the finishing touches to a secret and lucrative business deal with an oil company founded by one of the most senior members of the Saudi royal family.
&gt; 
&gt; Under the deal, it was agreed that TBA would help promote the firm — PetroSaudi International — to Chinese leaders. The proposed fees were £41,000 ($75,600) a month and a 2 per cent cut of any deal it helped broker.
&gt; 
&gt; The previous year, the company had agreed a controversial $US1.7bn ($2bn) venture with a state Malaysia investment fund.
&gt; 
&gt; The contract specifically stated it would be Mr Blair himself who would arrange introductions in China, where the former Labour Party leader has travelled extensively.
&gt; 
&gt; “It is what it says on the tin,” said one insider with knowledge of the deal. “They wanted Tony Blair’s unique ability to introduce them to people.”
&gt; 
&gt; The contract states MR Blair would “(make) introductions to the senior political leadership, industrial policymakers, corporate entities and other persons in China identified and deemed by us and you to be relevant to PetroSaudi’s international strategy.”
&gt; 
&gt; The 21-page contract, including 16 pages of terms and conditions, gives a fascinating insight into Mr Blair’s business empire, which has been dubbed Blair Inc. The document — headed “strictly private and confidential” — says TBA can provide consultancy services “on geopolitical services”; “introduction to Chinese industrialists and politicians”; and introductions to “potential sources of equity and/or debt investment”.
&gt; 
&gt; There is one condition that is the keystone of Mr Blair’s financial empire: utter discretion. The contract states: “Each party will ensure that no announcements, statements or documentation containing any reference to either party or to Tony Blair will be published or made without the prior express written consent of the other party.”
&gt; 
&gt; The deal would never have come into the public eye had the contract not been leaked.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr Blair sees no contradiction between this type of work and the principles espoused in the Beijing speech in November 2010. This is partly because he considers it helps finance his extensive unpaid activities, which include the Tony Blair Faith Foundation, which promotes dialogue between religions, and the African Governance Initiative, which promotes reform in Africa.
&gt; 
&gt; Many are, however, concerned at what they consider MR Blair’s race for cash since leaving office, with an opaque network of financial interests that stretch from the United Arab Emirates to Kazakhstan to America.
&gt; 
&gt; As an article in The Financial Times warned last May: “It is his single-minded, almost manic quest for personal riches that will leave the darker stain on the historical record. The trouble is that the boundaries between private profit and public service are hopelessly obscured in the corporate labyrinth that is Tony Blair Associates.”
&gt; 
&gt; Others say that because of his previous role as Britain’s leader and his role as representative of the quartet of the UN, the European Union, the US and Russia, which is mandated to help Middle East peace negotiations, Mr Blair is wrong to conceal his business interests.
&gt; 
&gt; The possible conflicts of interest are manifold. One of his most controversial decisions towards the end of his premiership was in effect to shut down the Serious Fraud Office inquiry in 2006 into a multi-billion-pound BAE Systems arms deal with Saudi Arabia.
&gt; 
&gt; It had been claimed a slush fund was used to make payments and gifts to senior Saudis, including members of the royal family.
&gt; 
&gt; Among the gifts were a fleet of cars, including a £170,000 Rolls-Royce, the use of private apartments and holidays. Mr Blair said if the inquiry had proceeded it would have wrecked a “vital strategic relationship” and resulted in the loss of “thousands of British jobs”.
&gt; 
&gt; The former prime minister is, however, likely to face questions about whether it was appropriate for him after leaving office to be paid by a private company founded by a senior member of the Saudi royal family.
&gt; 
&gt; He will also face questions over the scale of any confidential business deals in the Middle East and whether they may have led to conflict with his role as Middle East envoy.
&gt; 
&gt; A group of former British ambassadors has already joined a campaign calling for him to be removed from the unpaid post, citing his role in the Iraq invasion, the lack of progress on his Middle East mandate and the lack of transparency over his business dealings and personal finances.
&gt; 
&gt; Since leaving Downing Street, Mr Blair has amassed a vast fortune with his property portfolio alone comfortably worth £25m. He has secured advisory roles with the US investment bank JP Morgan and Swiss insurer Zurich International. He is also one of the best-paid speakers in the world, earning as much as £150,000 for a single speech.
&gt; 
&gt; His main commercial activities come under the umbrella of TBA. The consultancy operates through a complex corporate structure involving two main groups of partnerships and companies, Firerush and Windrush.
&gt; 
&gt; One of the Firerush partnerships is registered with the Financial Conduct Authority for its investment services. Some of its key individuals are comprised of executives who have worked for some of the world’s biggest banks, including Goldman Sachs and Barclays.
&gt; 
&gt; TBA’s client list — and the modus operandi of its employees — are, however, carefully guarded secrets. Staff who have worked at Mr Blair’s office say the fear of damaging information slipping into the public domain pervades the whole operation.
&gt; 
&gt; The Saudi oil firm at the centre of the November 2010 Blair deal boasted impressive credentials. It was co-founded in 2000 by Prince Turki bin Abdullah Al Saud, one of King Abdullah’s sons. The other co-founder was Tarek Obaid, a Saudi businessman who has been a partner of Renault’s Formula 1 team.
&gt; 
&gt; PetroSaudi has offices in London, Geneva and Riyadh. Its investments have included projects in Ghana, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Tunisia. It is a relative upstart in an industry dominated by big long-term players, but its global ambitions were bolstered in 2009 with a deal with 1 Malaysia Development Board, a company owned by the Malaysian government.
&gt; 
&gt; 1MDB agreed to participate in a joint venture with an initial $US1bn investment. The money helped established the fledgling company as an international operation.
&gt; 
&gt; There were questions in Malaysia over the lack of transparency in the deal, and 1MDB later disposed of its interest.
&gt; 
&gt; PetroSaudi executives were, however, already looking for new sources of investment and Mr Blair was a key to access the Chinese market.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr Blair has good contacts in the China Investment Corporation, which has £400bn of assets and is one of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds. His work for PetroSaudi, however, soon petered out, although the reason is not known. Blair’s office would not comment last week on the total amount of money he was paid.
&gt; 
&gt; A spokesman said: “Tony Blair Associates worked for PetroSaudi for a period of months over four years ago. This was in connection with an issue in the Far East and nothing whatever to do with the Middle East or the unpaid ex-officio role of Tony Blair for the quartet in Palestine.
&gt; 
&gt; “TBA has had no involvement in Malaysia and has no knowledge of the matter.”
&gt; 
&gt; Patrick Mahony, chief investment officer of PetroSaudi, said Mr Blair was engaged on a confidential basis to help develop business in China. He said the work lasted “about four of five months maximum”.
&gt; 
&gt; He said that Turki no longer had any financial interest or official role in the company.
&gt; 
&gt; A spokesman for 1MDB said all money invested in PetroSaudi was returned to 1MDB with interest and there was no ongoing financial relationship.

10/11 years old are terrifying! Especislly when away from home, in big groups and then you mix in some adrenaline. These little buggers are just coming into themselves,  and have yet to gain that teenage angst and filter adults automatically apply. And im not a teacher, so they are fearless.

I disagree about them ""dragging down the technical level of the team"" as well, because we've been playing the same fluid passing game as last season - just lacking a bit of tempo, or cutting edge in attack. Lallana, Markovic and Can all showed this against Madrid.

Finally you can't say that they're dragging us down ""technically"" and then compare them ""defensively"", as you've done with Moreno, Lovren and Manquillo; Moreno's clearly better technically than Flanagan, Lovren's poor form is clearly unrelated to his very good technical ability, and Manquillo's clearly been better defensively than Johnson despite his inferior technical ability.",0,1415529747,null,0,false,0,clxda0n,t3_2lpo1w,t1_clxda0n,t1_clx7aqs,null,1426114625,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Age is a protected characteristic under equality legislation. So, age discrimination is illegal - although I suppose it may not be discrimination if you are only discriminating between adults and children.

The key thing is that there is ""direct"" and ""indirect"" discrimination. Direct means a deliberate discrimination based upon a protected characteristic. Indirect discrimination means that a policy by discriminating against an unprotected characteristic, may by virtue of that discriminate against a protected characteristic.

For example, you run a 24/7 business. You introduce a new rota which requires your staff to do a pro-rata number of unsocial hours. This is indirect sexual discrimination, because this rota is likely to be awkward for single parents, and single parents are most likely to be women.

That said, I think that a policy of no single adult does pick out certain groups - retirees, widows/widowers, etc. who tend to be older. In this way, it would appear to be direct age discrimination.

I honestly thought that when he was falling from the sky to the TARDIS he would use it like the First Doctors Signet Ring... alas, the Moff was cruel and unforgiving. 

Also; a more... touchy question.... Why were all the Cybermen tall athletic masculine figures? Did someone forget about all the dead women? Not to mention the children? It's also unfortunate to note that babies do die sometimes. What about them? Was the Cyberman process picky? 

Osgood.... god damn it Moffat. She was perfect! Why are you  killing off these characters? Missy too! Probably.... hopefully not.

Moffat is a good writer sometimes. Take Dark Water for instance; it was a perfect way to begin a two parter. Though this episode just... fell flat. Which is a shame, it had so much potential, but it turned into Dan Dan the Soldier man saving the world by commanding his army to fly high into the skies... and explode. Somewhat akin to the Sontaran Stratagem. 

The ending.... so incredibly anticlimactic. The episode was absolutely beautiful, and the acting was top notch. But why, oh why, Moffat do you  have to end like that?

THAT is a good piece of writing... unfortunately, Moffat forgot that one), but it's safe to say that there were a few onions in the room as I watched.

Personal allowance is £10k.  Knock this off your salary to find out how much you have to pay tax on - leaving you £35k taxable income.

Of this £35k, you pay 20% on £31866 - or £6373.20 tax.

It's a story. There are clearly backbench MPs trying to start a movement to unseat Miliband ahead of the General Election.

Yes, the press can be biased. Yes, they can have their own agendas. However that does not mean they're all in it together and will literally invent quotes and stories to 'smear' people*. The fact The Observer, not a Murdoch Paper and one friendly to Labour for the most part, is running this story and so is every other paper would suggest there is something in it. Several political journalists from the BBC, to the Guardian, to The Times and to the Daily Mail have said they have heard Labour MPs express serious concern to them over Miliband's leadership if not outright expressions of a desire to remove him. 

Now either this is a wide ranging conspiracy from every paper to get rid of the man or it's because there is something in it. You shouldn't be surprised about this either, the man has failed to take advantage of a favourable electoral landscape to dominate in the polls. He barely registers on the national stage.

That said; Missy's ""death"" was easily the least convincing Time Lord death ever. The Doctor himself has been struck by a dalek gun and didn't evaporate. Dalek guns have been proven time and time again to be ridiculously more powerful than cyber guns. Missy just had a well timed teleport.

Now here's some plot points to think about...

-What will become of the Sphere? Humans now have in their capable hands; the most powerful hard drive in the universe, AND software to use said hard drive! 

-Wait. Is Danny and the rest of the dead people conscious in the sphere again? Does this mean humans can now chat with anybody who has ever died?! History class is canceled. How did the child reformat from FAT32DEAD to organic? Missy; I can understand some form of cloud link between body and digibody, same with the Cybermen, but that child was DEAD and DECOMPOSED and/or in a cyber body! ...But not anymore!

-I can accept that the brigadier is just so resilient that he refused the order to go blow up. Not that the brigadier takes orders. :P Now he's back at UNIT, in glorious cyber form, calling the shots with his daughter.

-The Master ""must have a TARDIS somewhere."" Well, yeah. We've established that Missy has been chillin' on Gallifrey.
She probably teleported back to it in her weak attempt at a faked death.

-Nick Frost as Santa? I expect a Simon Pegg elf. This needs to happen.

One last thing:

Accept the fact that the Time Lords are back. That's easily what next season is going to contain.

This is my speculation: Missy was truly begging for the Doctor's friendship. The rhythm of four is no longer in her head, she can think a bit more clearly, and knows there is no reconciling with the Council of the Time Lords.

First of all, the data point says *""People have a duty to contribute money to public service""*. Duty implies a moral obligation but also a choice... as though if you chose not to pay tax you might be immoral.

However we don't have a choice to pay tax, it is non-negotiable and forced upon the populace. That doesn't make it wrong, but it doesn't make it moral. Otherwise any immoral individual or one who hates paying tax could argue simply by paying their taxes that they are a moral person. Morals are ethical positions that one would hold regardless of the law, not a legal obligation.

Like it or not, at least some of those staunch defenders of the right to keep your money might answer differently to a question phrased such as *""Is it your moral duty to donate some of your money to the poor?""*. Some may simply resent the government taking it by force and would rather they control how it's distributed (I'm not saying this is the most sensible redistribution of wealth, because I don't think it is).

Personally I'm all for taxes, simply because it forces people to provide for services that we wouldn't have otherwise, but I don't consider myself moral for just paying taxes and I would definitely like to see differences in how they are collected and spent.

Now obviously having sex with children is wrong (although there's space to argue what the age of consent should be, what with it being a compromise). But people have treated homosexuality and interracial marriage in *exactly* the same way. In the minds of many bigots a man having sex with a man is as bad (or worse) than peadophilia.

Laws which convict people of crimes for simply stating ""I don't agree with this law and think it should be changed"" are incredibly dangerous as they prevent any change, both good and bad. They should have the right to publically state their opinions. We, as a democratic country, should then review that and make a decision. I am confident that decision would be to tell them to ""fuck off you fucked up bastards"".

Also, them being a public member of such an organisation gives you a handy list of people to keep an eye on (within the boundaries of the law).",0,1415532795,null,0,1415533824,0,clxdrmz,t3_2lq4ta,t1_clxdrmz,t1_clxcmoj,null,1426114397,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

The employer paid VAT (20%) rather than employers' NI (13.8%). Their business doesn't charge VAT, so they were unable to claim any substantial amount of that back. I paid Corporation Tax (20%) and Income Tax with the dividend tax credit that came to about 15% - which was roughly the same as what I would have been paying had I been employed.

So why bother if it costs more? Well, it gives both client and contractor additional flexibility that they wouldn't otherwise have. The client can terminate a contract, or vary the conditions without having to comply with employment legislation.

It's interesting that you say that because I thought that for something that was so important to the resolution of the season their relationship wasn't focused on enough.

I stood there before the crosses
glowing white in row on row
Everyone a young life cut short
as the names upon them show.

The dates they died below the names
tell of wars now passed and gone
Passchendaele, the Somme, and Mons
of battles fought, and lost or won.

History remembers, as it should
these men who fought and died 
Whilst for their families left behind
a dull sorrow tinged with pride.

The faces of boys held now in Sepia
who died in days long gone
yet living on in memories 
and hearts, still holding on.

Yet despite the hurt and grief here 
what with horror makes me fill
Is that when I look behind me
there are more new crosses growing still.

Personally, I find it hard to see how speaking gaelic imbues a person with an ethnicity that someone who doesn't speak Irish cannot otherwise have.

Just seems to me like there's a very keen desire by nationalists to grab a hold of the ""that's racist"" defence to prevent any further questioning of their orthodoxies. Again - a sign of intellectual insecurity.

However, the burden of proof in this case falls on YOU to demonstrate the positive, not I the negative - that speaking Irish DOESNT make you a member of a special racial group.

If I had rate the series (including the specials from between Series 4 &amp; 5):

**Best**

Series 5 - If you are willing to give Victory of Daleks a pass (it was Dalek episode that BBC forced on Moffat, IIRC), then you will enjoy this Series.

Series 1 - In terms of episode quality, this one has a lot of good episodes. In some ways, I wish Ninth did another series, but at the same time, his one run in Series 1 was perfect.

Series 6 - It's a great series, don't get me wrong. But what killed this series was that it was pretty predictable (especially in this day and age of the internet).

**Typical Doctor Who (meaning this is your average NuWho series)**

Series 4 - While I liked Donna, the series finale was one 'magic reset button' too many with all this build up and not paying off. The status quo really got to me.

Series 8 - Not a great Series but not a bad one either.

Series 3 - While this Series has its major flaws (JesusTennant and the magic reset button, for example), this series really helped me enjoy NuWho once again. Blink and a few episodes here and there did help this.

Series 7 - While I will defend Series 7 as being an okay series, it does have it's problems.

**Bad**

Specials (after Series 4) - BLAH! Only saving grave the last 20 minutes of End of Time, Part 2.

Series 2 - *Love &amp; Monsters*, *Fear Her* and the Tennant/Rose dynamic really put me off in the series (and nuWho, in general, for awhile).

The rather touching reference to Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart being the Cyberman who saved Kate I really enjoyed. The Master in this episode was a very good Master, much like John Simm's Master and Michelle Gomez's acting was great. The acting from all the rest of the cast was great, especially Capaldi's, as usual. The Cybermen's ultimate plan I quite liked and them finally being able to fly was a nice touch as well. However I did not like the use of the Cybermen in the episode as they didn't really do a lot and it feels that ever since Moffat took over as head-writer they have been second-rate villains and not the Doctor's second most notable and dangerous enemy. I also did not like what the Master did in the episode that much. Sure she killed a few people but she sort of just stood in the background a bit.

For example, under Benitez we had Alonso and Mascherano as two holding midfielders and Gerrard could do whatever he wanted up front. Mascherano was the aggressive one and closed down players quickly. Alonso was the deep-lying playmaker but he was alright tackler if my memory isn't failing me, but it wasn't his job to break down the play. They both could do defensive job and it was relatively defensive midfield. However it had very big advantage of having an attacking midfielder who didn't have to defend. We currently don't play a midfielder who is great tackler and has good positional sense. Gerrard has never been any of that and it shows. 

At the moment every one of our 3 midfielders have to defend and none of them are attacking enough to warrant a role as attacking midfielder. It just doesn't make sense. 

By the way, Lucas was an amazing tackler. I think he was on top of several lists at one point and he had ability to mark or tackle players out of the game. I'd give him a chance in the league, without Gerrard besides him. Last time we did this in the league was probably last year, December.

Now, the bad: I didn't feel anything for Danny Pink. His character was boring and his relationship with Clara seemed so forced the whole season. The plot was so predictable. Of course, Danny Pink was not going to succumb to being a Cyber Man because of his love for Clara and of course he was going to save the world. The Master's plan to create an army to give to the Doctor just seemed stupid and ruined what was otherwise a brilliant rebranding of the character. There were parts that were just way over the top like the Doctor sky diving into the TARDIS or the whole bit with the Brigadier. I was disappointed that the anti-soldier theme remained anti-soldier and the thread of the Doctor being a good man or not was pretty weak.  In the end, neither the Cyber Men nor the Master really felt like much of a threat. Clara has become way to whiney.  Finally, having Santa bust in at the end just seemed a weird tonal shift.

(Although there's certainly a lot of competition.) 

Most of the filler eps were silly and inconsequential.  The arc plotting didn't even add up to much, besides as background to pure melodrama.    The Doctor's mood swings made him something like an even more temperamental, judgmental, and generally unhinged combination of One, Three, and Six.  Clara's relationship with him got so abusive that it was just painful to watch.  The Doctor became increasingly irrelevant to his own stories, like Five.  And Danny was just a non-character, a cipher to give Clara someone *else* to lie to.

And on top of that, shoehorning heavy-handed political messages into the show, like some of JNT's most over-the-top moments?

Somehow, the Doctor gets his army from the Master, realises he's not an entirely good man and decides to take matters into his own hands. Goes to ""free the galaxy of evil"" with his army and eventually becomes mad with power.

The two options for the plot to go:

- This incarnation of the Doctor is on his deathbed. Realizes he went against all he ever stood for. The next incarnation is the person we knew as Clara Oswald. He decides to go back in time and try to change the time line.  
- The Master sees his former friend become mad. It's not what he wanted and Missy eventually dies. Regenerates into Clara Oswald and finds a way to go back and tries to change the outcome of things.

This is the crux of the argument though.

Many rich people don't benefit from the taxes of others... and where they do benefit, such as roads, policing, fire services... they could actually afford to invest in a private company to handle all that for them in their gated communities.

But then morally you could say they have an obligation to help those communities that can't afford private forces... therefore if there was no law requiring they pay such taxes, there would still be moral duty.

What I'm getting at is that the moral duty to help others less fortunate than yourself is not dependent on or provided by the law.

&gt; But i just need somebody to explain to me why Kaboul and Townsend start over Vert and Lamela. 

Stoke play with a tall, physical #9 and Kaboul and Fazio are both taller and more physical than Jan. That selection makes sense to me. The problems have come from their quicker players, who we are failing to track.

Townsend was probably our best player in midweek and one of Stoke's weaknesses is the fullbacks. He cuts inside a lot, but he's probably the closest thing we have to a left winger, so his selection also makes sense. Granted, I would have dropped Eriksen, not Lamela.

&gt; Or why Dier isn't starting. 

This one I'm not sure...I think he deserves a start. That said, we're starting Kane and Townsend, so maybe he didn't want to introduce three new players all at once?

&gt; And most importantly why we're playing 2 CDMs against a Stoke side. 

We're not. Ryan Mason is a #10 playing deeper. He is nowhere near a defensive midfielder.

&gt; We didn't create any chances that first half and it's because we stick Kane out there alone, instead of partnering him up with Soldado or (fan favorite) Adebayor.

In my opinion Ade doesn't deserve to start. Soldado perhaps could start with Kane, but remember that against Asteras Tripoli, a worse team than Stoke, we immediately lost control of the midfield when Soldado came on for Lamela.

Then, with Hitler and Apartheid South Africa, the ridiculousness of the concept became increasingly evident when governments tried to classify people. So your Great Granny was Jewish? Are you Jewish, Aryan, acceptably impure, or unacceptably impure. The lunacy became apparent.

Modern day genetics then reveals almost all of us are a large hotch potch of all sorts.

I'd love you to hold up a single Irish person who's ""pure"" Celtic. I don't think it exists.

Moreover, a belief in ""pure national ancestry"" has rather disturbing evocations of the ""blood and soil"" permetations of 1930s Europe, that modern Irish republicanism was also born in.

In summary - I don't believe its I who is being ""racist"". It would be difficult for me to be I believe, as I don't think such a thing actually exists.

&gt;

&gt;__Blood and Soil__ ([German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language): *Blut und Boden*) refers to an [ideology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology) that focuses on [ethnicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity) based on two factors, [descent blood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_classification\)) (of a [folk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk)) and [territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territoriality_(nonverbal_communication\)). It celebrates the relationship of a people to the land they occupy and cultivate, and it places a high value on the virtues of rural living.

Though I really rate him higher than Jovetic (too inconsistent), but it depends on the manager whom he picked at the end of the days.

I'm on mobile but a quick google throws up [this](http://www.iasj.net/iasj?func=fulltext&amp;aId=68018) article which talks about how kaolin (a clay) is very good at [a*d*sorbtion](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/2ksjkm/the_more_you_know_absorption_vs_adsorption/) so forming a film on the surface of the skin. I'd hazard a guess that this make it a very good vehicle for actives.


So the mask I like to use is full of moisturising agents, oils, salicylic acid and niacinamide, and the mask holds it all close to my skin so it can absorb the good stuff? As well as absorbing sebum, I feel like my skin is instantly clearer and glowier. Redness is reduced and the next morning a spot that would normally be huge, is smaller.


I'm also vigilant about not keeping clay masks on for too long. I think if you let it get to the dry crack-y stage (any longer than 15 minutes) I get dehydrated and irritated skin, that this [blog post](http://www.marcelle.com/blog/clay-mask/) goes into a little detail about.

This isn't strictly true it's just that there are so many more factors affecting ordinary jobs that a strong economy will tend to help normal people only if the other factors don't prevent it. High unemployment will cause wages to stagnate for example and lax labour laws can encourage exploitation. It's perfectly possible that wages will increase faster than the stock market and low unemployment or a requirement for rare skills can push wages in a particular job up much faster than inflation and investments. 

Thomas Piketty published a relatively well-received book this year on inequality which highlights one important thing - rich people don't get rich via wages, they get rich through investments. Wages will hopefully increase with inflation provided other factors allow it but investments will grow at their own rates depending mainly on economic risk in an economy which fluctuates much less than the factors that affect wages. This means that when investments are increasing in value faster than wages (as they are now) rich people are getting richer faster than poor people and the wealth gap is increasing. It also highlights the fact that income tax is basically worthless in combating inequality and capital gains is where it's at but that's another story.

How can you possibly rate John Gudetti higher than Jovetic? 
Jovetic has 8 goals in 18 appearances for City, how is that inconsistent?

Your basing your evaluation of Guidetti on his past, the guy has only played for us competitively once or twice iirc, I mean frankly thats ridiculous. Jovetic put away 40 goals for Fiorentina and was one of Serie A's hottest properties.

That's why we have a disconnect from real inflation by using CPI. That margin between real inflation and CPI (1 - 2% a year, ish) allows them to chip away at these commitments out in the open without having to explicitly state it. The country can grin and bear it for a while as long as wages get back to rising with CPI inflation which should be sufficient to quietly inflate away these debts over a few decades.

There is a problem in the sense that government has become so entwined with the markets that the markets look to the government to produce debt for them to buy to help stabilise it when there's a lot of volatility. We only need to see what happened with the BoJ a mere two days after the Fed stopped QE3 in the US. Our problems are international now, as are everyone elses.

Yes they do, perhaps disproportionately, but everything from basic infrastructure to paying the wages of civil servants (who's work hopefully benefits us all) benefits everybody. There are also many services, which are a necessary consequence of an advanced, democratic society which, in my opinion, can not or should not be private entities; police services, courts, legislative bodies and welfare services for instance. Therefore, if any individual wishes to remain as part of said society, they have a duty to contribute to these vital services. 

Given all of that, I agree with everything in your other paragraphs, they are not mutually exclusive. Sorry if I gave the idea that I didn't.

1. We need to get u/The-Darkest-Knight to stop doing match threads.
2. I'm really tired of being baffled by our team selection. Ever since AVB's second year I just can't understand our team. Today it felt like Poch thought we were going to walk over Stoke and gave Fazio and Townsend the nod.  Fazio is really baffling. Hasn't played in Prem league. Drew a red in the Euro league. Vert has done pretty well in the Prem. It's just wildly frustrating. And Townsend, I mean come on. Lamela is obviously the better choice at that wing. More creative, doesn't give the ball away as easily. Offers way more as far as crossing and passing go. 
3. Capoue has been really poor. Yes he has. Looks like a center half in midfield. I mean Huddlestone is more mobile and has a defter pass I feel. 
4. Danny Rose. I know you guys feel like you need to defend him but he offers literally almost nothing. At most he is an average defender. Every time he goes forward it is a straight give away. Might as well kick it out of bounds. Barring that amazing finish by Chadli which he had no right to score from. 
5. Fan attitude. Y'all need to understand where we're at. There's no more Gareth Bale. There's no more Luka. We made the champions league one year. We're not entitled to it. We have never consistently run over teams like Stoke. It's time we get behind the team no matter what. I'm sorry but we're not as good as we make us out to be. So fuck it and cheer as loud as you can no matter what. Our home crowd is becoming a detriment to our league play. 
6. The announcers fucking infuriate me. It's so hard to watch games like this with guys bad mouthing us. Totally ignoring positive contributions from our home support and just overall bagging on our team. We haven't been the best but you can be sure as shit Everton doesn't get treated like we do with just as slow a start.

*Regarded as the best peel for treating blemished and hyper-pigmented skin*


*Medium strength peel. Will provide slight peeling. Best choice for more significant blemishes.""*

**About you:** Dry skin prone to dehydration and PIH.

**Your opinion:** 
Just amazing! If you've got sensitive or dry or darker skin, I wholly recommend you try a mandelic acid product. I've had no peeling, no sensitivity, just a little tingle when it's on. This products has eliminated the majority of my closed comodones and after only 4 uses over 4 weeks, gone further to fade my most stubborn PIH than anything else. 

I am a seasoned AHA user, but most products dry out my skin in return for any benefit.

Customer service is top-notch, Kelli replies within 24 hours happy to help with any queries! I've got nothing bad to say other than I wish they did a stronger percentage like MUAC, and maybe more product.

Well, that's less a fact we can argue on and more an opinion we just disagree on I suppose. I can respect you for it, but don't you think (to an extent) that organisations with extreme or bigoted views should be made to change? Where would you draw the line between the freedom to hold such views (Which I support - we mustn't try and police thought) and the freedom to express them? Discrimination in adoption is ok to you, but is it ok in marriage? In inheritance law? What about employment?

&gt;I also would much, much prefer children live with a man and woman instead of two of each.

Once again, a valid, if controversial opinion. I get your point, but disagree. Without launching into a big debate on child psychology which I certainly have no experience in and doubt you do either, I cant really argue with you there, but I would hazard against allowing discrimination when there is no evidence for or against that it is for the 'greater good' of children. 

&gt;It's not so black and white as Catholics bad, gays good.

Of course not - Catholics, as I said, have a right to think and feel what they like, and I would never 'force' them to accept gays. The issue comes when their bigotry leaks into their actions. We as a society have enshrined in law the equality of gays, women, and pretty much every other minority. It is in most cases, illegal to discriminate based on these factors. For any organisation to do so, they are in breach of the law and should expect to be shut down. Their stubbornness in this is what harms the children, not the oh so horrible concept of being forced to consider gays equally. 


This, to me, is less an issue of ""catholics vs gays"" and more about discrimination and equality. Nobody should feel like they are disadvantaged in life because of how they are born. And in the same way, nobody has the right to make people feel that way. Discrimination is wrong, and those who practise it do not get to hold power, that is a conclusion that we as a society have come to over the last 50 or so years of social progress.",0,1415547240,null,0,false,0,clxh3ht,t3_2loct8,t1_clxh3ht,t1_clxfgz7,null,1426112844,1,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1

Legally, the UK is one unitary state, like Ireland or France. It has one sovereign parliament that can change ANY law it wants to. 

When we refer to 'countries' of the UK, it's a bit of an anachronism. In law, they're actually just 'regions'. However, until 1998, this didn't reflect the real *political* situation. The historical countries within the UK have distinct cultures, laws (Scotland and NI are different jurisdictions from England &amp; Wales), and political priorities (much like your states). I.e. Scottish, Welsh, and NI people weren't happy with all the decisions on how their money was spent being made in London, by people who had not been voted to represent their local interests.  

The solution offered was to create three legislatures in Wales, Scotland, and NI, that would have local governments deciding on local laws, in much the same way that federal states like in the U.S., Canada, Germany etc. operate. They're not balanced legislatures, i.e. Scotland has far more powers devolved to it than Wales, but bit by bit it's starting to balance out and become a more logical system.

It's meant that laws and decisions regarding environmental policy, education, urban redevelopment, health etc. have been made by people much closer to the people who vote in the representatives. 

There's still huge debate about the over-centralisation of the UK, and how we can move some of the power and money out of London. In such a diverse nation, it just seems silly that so much of our culture should be focused around one city.

Can you imagine in the states if 90% of all investment, political decision-making, and art came from Washington D.C., and everyone else were left to pick up the scraps?

Hence why we're looking at other ways to spread out the power a bit and improve democracy. E.g. having an elected mayor for Manchester who will be able to make meaningful financial decisions about the place where he/she'll be situated. 

England is still left without its own government and legislature, and there's an odd situation by which Scottish, Welsh, and NI members of parliament can vote on laws that only affect England (because we're still, in law, a unitary state, with one *sovereign* parliament.)

We're heading bit by bit towards a form of 'federalism light'. I.e. regionalised powers but with a political underpinning rather than a constitutional one, and it's done wonders for the other 'home nations'.",0,1415547419,null,0,false,0,clxh5vg,t3_2lr199,t1_clxh5vg,t1_clxgakt,null,1426112813,22,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,22

1. I do not expect Fazio to start another game any time soon. 
2. Naughton was probably our best player on the pitch. Absolute shame that his performance is a bit marred by the red card, although Mason is more to blame for it. 
3. Chadli's goal was fantastic, quickly turning into this season's Dempsey (in a good way). 
4. As far as transfer activity this January window, I'd like to see us pick up a hard working, experienced player. He doesn't have to be incredibly talented or flashy. But someone who has energy that rubs off on his teammates, and the mental fortitude to keep it together in days such as these. Would've liked Shane Long if only for his hustle (his price, however, is another matter).  
5. Poch keeps talking about instilling philosophy into the club... Can anyone see this on the pitch? For the life of me, I can't figure out what system we're playing, if any. Doesn't look like what he did in soton. For example, our midfield is all over the place. Our inverted wingers come inside, often pushing players you'd think should be in the box (Ade) to the wings. I know I'm not the only one noticing this ie this is clearly intentional, but I'm curious as to what the reasoning behind it is.

Both parties are simply mouthpieces for their donors and their donors make money off of private healthcare and pollution and the defence industry etc etc so they pay the politicians to support their interests. The politicians persuade many people but even if they don't persuade everyone it's not really an issue for the companies and billionaires because the people have no-one else to vote for. Either way they win and progress even if the people want it will never come. It's a political system that is openly corrupt and the corrupt people are the only one's who can change it. The one chance they had to begin to fix it was in a case last year (I don't know if any people here follow US Supreme Court news) in McCutcheon v The FEC but the judges decided to affirm their previous decision which constitutionally protected the ability of the very rich to give an unlimited (in total) amount of money to any or both political candidates and unbelievably seemed to rule that it was unconstitutional for the government to prevent corruption (in the form of job promises etc). I'll quote the court itself:

&gt;Moreover, while preventing corruption or its appearance
is a legitimate objective, **Congress may target only a 
specific type of corruption—“quid pro quo” corruption.**...That Latin phrase captures the notion of a direct exchange of an official act for money. 

In other words not only is it legal for a corporation to promise someone a favour or a job later if they work for their interests now and against the people's interests (provided it's not technically cash for specific actions) but it's not even a 'legitimate objective' for Congress to try and prevent this behaviour. The voting public themselves are not actually allowed to make that illegal unless they changed the constitution which requires 66% support and could very well be considered impossible with the current deadlock and corruption. 

There's a lot we could learn from in the American Constitution and government generally with regard to privacy protections (of which we have none) and free speech etc but this is really not one of them.

I can't deny that Fazio had a howler.   He was careless with simple passes in midfield and clearances in our own box.   Against better clubs, we would have conceded an additional goal or two with those mistakes.

I wonder if Jan was sat because of the Europa match, but our next match isn't for another 2 and a half weeks.    I always think we are more stable on our back line with Vertonghen playing.  He's vocal in his communication, technically sound, and can even make the occasional CB run as long as Capoue or Mason are covering.   I'm not sure why he isn't first choice CB on our sheet.

In the middle:
I think Mason and Lamela's work rates are great.  However, Mason shows some top-level inexperience and bungles a number of short passes, especially in the second half which caused counter-attacks.   Losing short balls as a deep-lying playmaker in midfield is a recipe for disaster.  Need to re-watch, but I'm pretty sure one of his bad passes led to the Moses run and Naughton's foul for the red card.   I think Lamela needs to be talked to about trying to do too much by himself.  If that message can be effectively communicated, he will improve his own game and the team.  I think, many times, defenders know he is going to try to skill the ball past defenders rather than pass the ball.  If defenders respect his passing ability, he will be able to take advantage of his ball skills and have more room to effectively pass.

Good:
Chadli and Lloris.   Chadli sometimes can go absent in games or lack pace in certain situations.   However, I can't deny his football IQ and ability to poach with his movement.  His cross to Adebayor in the last minutes and his position for the goal were solid.   Lloris is Lloris.  Vocal to the backline and a rock.

I know it's a bit cliche saying this recently, but Rom was really poor today and I feel a stint on the bench would be good for him and the team. Missing chances like is unforgivable. Eto'o up top can do a job, and while he's a good number ten, we've got Barkley and Naismith who are excellent in that role too.

Martinez, not for the first time this season, got his subs all wrong as well. McGeady was one of the only bright sparks in our play, taking him off when we had just conceded was poor. Again, think Romelu should have been replaced with Naismith or Eto'o going up top and the other playing off them. Osman coming on for five minutes was pointless as well. If that sub was going to be made it should have ten or fifteen minutes minimum before the end so Leon had time to impact the game.

The international break has come at a good time though. Hopefully Barry and Mirallas will be fighting fit for the West Ham game. People tend to forget we're missing big names. If McGeady can keep this run of form up, I really can see him and Mirallas terrorising teams. We've got plenty of options for the number ten role, we've tightened up defensively, and despite what I've said, Lukaku will kick on at some point, all he needs is a kick up the arse.

Generally when a manager takes over a team there are some teething issues. A start like Soton have made under Koeman is very unusual. 

However, i think our issues under Poch go beyond teething issues, they are the same inherent issues with the imbalance in the squad. That for me is the reason that Poch's Spurs look the same as AVB's Spurs, which would look the same as under any other manager. 

Poch will need to clean house; sell or loan those he doesn't want, and bring in a host of players who can play his style, or we won't see any change in performances.

false,Baggzio,newcr-1,You Signed Lambert We Signed No One At All!!,"Well.. That was bad....really bad. Our backline was actually quite solid, yes even Distin and Macca was class throughout hope him and Barry aren't out for too long as they looked bad. But our attacking was woeful. Thought McGeady was the only one to look like he could make something and I guarantee he will be the one who's most slagged off and rated lowest. Eto'o did nothing but give away the ball really until the penalty. Barkley is not a winger, so why is he on the wing?? Was ineffective because he had to do a lot more than usual not fair to criticise him but it was bad. Rom needs dropping. He played well against Lille (for his standards bare in mind) and now we got this perforamance. Should've easily scored that one on one and should've been in the game more. I actually got a thought watching the game of ""Kone would want to be back soon"" I mean for fuck sake I've barely seen the lad play and I'm pretty sure he'll be shit but I was wishing for him to come back so Rom would get benched for a while, because it seems Eto'o doesn't want to be up top anymore. Sort your shit out Rom because we all want you to be successful and everything but this is starting to take the piss a small bit. 

As for the subs I think they were all wrong. What happened to Gibbo? He was one of our best passers before now anything over 10 yards is a gamble? What's that about? Definitely think Besic should start in Barry's absence. Naisy was class when he came on but no way McGeady should've been taken off. Thought it was definitely Eto'o should've been off that time or even Rom. And Ossie is just a pointless sub again because guess what? He's not a winger either, so stop playing him as one. 

All in all I'm sick of Roberto trying to fit all these players into the same team and fucking with positions. E.g Rom, Eto'o, Ross and McGeady can't fit in the same team. Either play 2 up front and sacrifice McGeady or play 1 up front with wingers and sacrifice Eto'o, it's quite simple. Stop playing players out of position because it's not helping anyone. Barkley should always be central no matter who else is there. Naisy should be his one and only serious competition. Not Eto'o. McGeady and Mirallas when he's back are our first choice wingers. Play Kev on the right, McGeady on the left and we're sorted. Don't try and fit the players in just because they're in form or something. If Eto'o is in form don't get rid of Naisy or Ross get rid of Rom. It's a simple compromise. 

Anyway MOTM for me would be McGeady if he hadn't been taken off but it has to be McCarthy because he was class throughout. 

Also what the fuck was Howard doing when he lid on the ball???

I won't be repurchasing unless it is on sale again. I am yet to finish the bottle, but it pales in comparison to my mandelic peel (see review).

I watched my first match and instantly fell in love. It was the Reading match because, like an idiot, I thought the League started in September. Throughout that season I saw late game heroics from Bale, strong play from Defoe and Dempsey, and I gladly rode the roller coaster of emotions. We finished 1 point away from the Champions League. A disappointment, sure, but I saw promise. I knew I'd chosen the right club. And then the AVB debacle unfolded, then Sherwood, and now we have Poch, whom I really like. 

I say all that to say this: I love this club. They frustrate me more than any other team I follow, but I keep coming back. I can't help it. And it's not because I was born in the blue part of the city. I've lived in Alabama my entire life. People around here don't understand why I get up at 7:15 to watch a team I'll likely never see in person. But it's what I do, because that's what this club means to me.

**Price of product:** £1.99 for one sponge, but frequently on 3 for 2


**Where did you purchase:** Superdrug in-store


**Product claims:** *""The unique texture of the konjac sponge delicately exfoliates and cleanses while helping to stimulate the circulation, leaving the skin feeling soft, smooth and refreshed""*

**About you:** Dry skin prone to dehydration and PIH.

**Your opinion:** 
My second konjac sponge. Previously I splashed out on [The Konjac Sponge Company Puff with added Bamboo Charcoal](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Konjac-Sponge-Added-Bamboo-Charcoal/dp/B0068L0TGU) which was £9.00, so I wanted to try something more sustainable. I really enjoy using these sponges, very gentle but fulfill my need to physically exfoliate. If I'm wearing makeup, I use it as the second step of my my double cleanse with my [foaming cleanser](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/comments/2icnkb/the_cleanser_reviews/cl6s6lx), squeezing it a few times to pump up the foam. At the moment I'm making the most of my currently clear skin and wearing no skin coverup so I use it with just water and I'm yet to suffer from the winter flakes! I know some people feel it's a fad, but flannels are too rough and microfibre cloths take too long to dry before I chuck them in the wash. I can just hang up this sponge and because it dries hard pretty quickly I don't feel squeamish with the germy aspect.


**Ingredients:** *Plain old konjac sponge*

2. At the end of the match Danny made a perfectly timed tackle, got up and kept the ball in play and then immediately went up the field and won a free kick. I have yet to see Davies do anything remotely close to that.

3. You want to put Vert at left back? That worked out so well last year. 

4. Poch wants the fullbacks to be super attacking. Danny Rose fits this system way better than Davies. Rose has been very good defensively aside from one mistake.  He generally has been one of our most consistent performers this season. Rose has the pace to get up and down the pitch way more than Davies ever will.

5. People are begging for Kyle Walker to come back and say he is the answer. Danny Rose is playing at the level Walker was. Walker and Rose are in the same mold as are Naughton and Davies.

6. Forget what Rose did last season. He's an entirely different player this season. Forget Davies of last season, he's on a new team and hasn't shown anything this season that even remotely compares to his excellent last season. 

7. What if Davies had been at fault for Stokes second goal? I'm willing to bet people would have been way more forgiving. Everyone is very harsh on Rose and it really needs to stop. Davies is not the answer. Not yet anyway.

Bonus point.

My other problem with this post is that it specifically  calls out just Rose. Aside from Lloris and Chadli and I thought Kane played well, everyone was awful. Specifically Kaboom, Fazio Dembele and Capoue, but all the blame goes right to Rose.  Most of the players I just listed are all the players that are supposed to be covering for Rose when he's out position. When they all have a horrendous match it's going to make Rose look worse than what he actually is.

If your answer to that is no, and it damn well should be, then you should hopefully understand why it needs to be possible to discuss this topic openly. There is a whole range of gray area between the unequivocally wrong that you're thinking of and what one could term 'definitely morally acceptable'.

You can have a 15 year old that know's what he/she wants, is clued up on STDs, has the confidence to say no and not be easily pursuaded into things by someone they see as an authority figure, and so on. Then you can have a sheltered 16 year old who meets none of these criteria and is highly vulnerable to abuse.

Legally, having sex with the 16 year old is fine (if you're not their teacher/doctor etc and they consent), but I'd suggest that in this case that's actually morally worse than having sex with the 15 year old that knows what he/she is doing.

Legally, the situation is black and white, morally it most certainly isn't. By discussing it openly we can make sure we're drawing that legal black and white dividing line in the best place we can, while acknowledging it'll always be a compromise between freedom and protection.

You are certainly right on one thing though, if we're certain child abuse has occurred then it most certainly should be fully investigated and if there is sufficiant evidence then people should be prosecuted. This is what really pisses me off about these asian gangs running pedo rings. Many people knew it was going on and did nothing. And I don't buy the whole ""worrying about racism"" explanation.

But, Poch wants us to play a high line with heavy pressing. This will take training, and, yes, moving away some players that might be quite talented but don't fit into the system. Right now, I feel like a few of the players are trying to play Poch's system (Chadli and Mason in particular), while a few are just determined to play their way (Ade and Lamela). I thought one of the most telling moments of the game was when Mason made a good tackle to take possession, and then went to pass to Naughton, and ended up just kicking it out of bounds because Naughton hadn't started driving forward. Total lack of communication.

As far as how to fix the team, I think if I could answer that I wouldn't be sitting around on the Internet right now. First things first, I'd get Kaboul and Fazio out. Both have been absolute nightmares, and should be reserved for sub duty. Vertonghen and Dier seems like the best combo to me. I know Dier's young, but he at least seems fit for how Poch wants the team going. Second, I would never, ever bring in Ade. I'd rather see Lamela or Chadli slotted in as striker than put in Ade. Playing with Ade is like playing with ten men. Bad attitude and lousy energy.

Finally, if I were Poch, I'd work my way up to the high press. Let the CBs drop a bit further back until the midfield gets comfortable pressing all the time.

Set pieces doesn't work (the best example is Atletico de Madrid, they play awful most of the time but they get a lot of victories with a header in a corner or free kick) and the use of the wings should be better.

The part that annoys me is that where it mislead us to felt like it would have been better than where it actually ended up going.  Having Clara be a sleeper of some kind and turn on him as part of her, or someone else's plan would have been great.  It even felt lined up with the previous episodes comment that her betrayal wouldn't be enough to negate her friendship with the Doctor.

Instead this hinted at, potentially superior, story line turns out to really just be a cheap trick to make the trailers exciting. 

As for the masters plan I somewhat understood that.  The Doctor has spent a lot of time expressing how lonely it is to be the last of his people and he wanted the master to still be in the universe even as he was just so that he would not be alone.

It it is much of a stretch to think the master does feel the same.  The master does not like that the doctor feels superior morally to him and has said as much.

If the doctor had an army the master, perhaps rightly, thinks the doctor will use that army to change the outcome of wars that the doctor feels are unjust.  In doing so one side would then live but the other side would die, by the doctors hand. This would mean that the doctor, by the application of his judgement and morality would cause massive death and destruction to those that he has deemed unworthy.

The doctor would then be the one who decides who lives and dies just as the master through his previous attempts to gain power has tried to get for himself.

Layer on that the idea that morality is not an objective ideal but the subjective judgement of those who are able to enforce their own particular perceived morals and the doctor and the master would be the same in what they do, they would just act in accordance to different ideals.  Same outcome, different motivation.

I may not be a hugely knowledgeable fan, but I am learning more all the time.

I knew I wanted to follow the Premier League and had to pick a team to follow. I set up a few rules for myself for the process of picking a team. Firstly I had heard that Man United were the Yankees of the PL, I hate the Yankees so I knew I could not be a fan of theirs. Secondly I did not want to be thought of as a front runner so I did not look at the table of last year's results. Lastly I wanted a team from London so when I do visit England one day I would like to see a match.

I looked up each teams histoy, crest, colors, etc. and found myself drawn to two teams, Chelsea and Arsenal. I chose Chelsea because I liked their colors, I loved their crest, and it was a team I honestly had never heard of before unlike Arsenal which I knew had a good American following.

I know my reasons sound superficial and it's hard to defend, but since I had no emotional attachment, unlike the American sports teams I follow, I had to find a process that worked for me.

And as much as he's a quality defender Touré doesn't have the legs to cover that much ground this late into his career - he's not going to be sprinting back 30 yards to get across to make a key tackle. 

Touré doesn't work in a system where we're looking to push forward and take the game. Whether that was the best gameplan against Chelsea is a different argument, but if we're looking to play football rather than camp our own area, then Touré isn't a great pick to start. I'd say maybe Rodgers should be trying to adapt a style that lets the in-form players perform rather than just dropping them because they don't fit how he wants to play, but if we *are* going to try and make the system we had on Saturday work then Touré isn't ever going to be a choice CB because it just doesn't suit his strengths and weaknesses these days.

Some taxation makes things worse for a lot of individuals who are very wealthy. Get rid of the NHS and there are plenty of people who could afford superior healthcare from the money they'd save on taxes and still have money left over from the difference.

Harry was a great wily old manager, but at the time I didn't have a problem with sacking him because he couldn't be the guy long term and there was some behind the scenes stuff involved. It was meant to be like when Chelsea sacked Ranieri and brought in Mou and took them to the next level (and honestly it did, higher point total ever, beat United under Fergie for the first time in 20 years). AVB was probably the worst sacking but he was genuinely trying to fit a square peg into a round hole with his high line and guys like Dawson, but ultimately in hindsight that was on Baldini's ineptitude more so than aVB who was just trying to make it work. Sherwood was groomed as Tottenham manager and would have probably succeeded Harry anyway if everything went according to the original plan, but the politics of the fans backlash made it impossible to keep him on. 

Ultimately, big clubs sack managers. You sack them till you find someone you can have 100% faith in to build with otherwise won't build the right atmosphere at the club. Levy is far from the only head of a club how does this, and it seems harsh but the club is the most important thing and maintain at the top level of world football you have to run an incredibly tight ship. Until we find the right guy who REALLY lookes like he can be on par with the Mourinho's and Klopp's of the world, there's no point to holding on to the idea of ""maybe he'll turn it around"" or ""I really want him to succeed, he's a nice guy"" or ""he's not bad, we can accept this even if it isn't want we really want"" It's a result based business like it or not, and if someone can't meet the goals and expectations set out by the club, you keep trying till to find someone who can.

3.  Series 8: Capaldi has been a nice change of pace from his three predecessors, and Clara has really come into her own this season. It had one of the best episodes I've seen in a while, and all of the base ideas explored this season were really great, even if there were some points where it could have been done better.

5. Series 3: When the episodes were good, they were REALLY good, but when they were bad, it was pig daleks.

This is quite clearly not true in all cases (a starving child stealing a loaf of bread from a millionaire is still stealing, yet has a positive effect). This is actually why I believe taxation is moral: While taxation is indubitably theft, and I absolutely cannot think of a way out of that conclusion, it doesn't necessarily follow that it is morally wrong. Taking from a millionaire to give to a starving child is not wrong, even if it involves a threat of violence.

Even if robbery *always* had a negative consequence, this still doesn't mean that the definition of robbery is contingent upon the negative effect itself. Robbery is taking something against the will of the owner. 

It's also pretty weak to defend taxation on the basis that it is not done by  ""private entities for selfish goals"". A passing glance at our current government can quickly validate that a) our tax money is being given to private entities without our explicit consent and b) this is being done for selfish reasons.

The monk who held the tail thought an elephant was a rope, while the monk with his hands on the ear was convinced that an elephant was like a Palm tree.

false,dexyds,flair8,,"I really strongly disagree with this post.  I don't disagree that Levy has been trigger happy, or that we may now be better of it we had stuck by anyone one of those managers, but the central premise that Levy is the problem is simply wrong.  There are many things we can point to as to why that idea is wrong.

Firstly - pre-Levy versus where we have been with him.  It has been said many times before and maybe it is due to the influx of new fans, but our time under Levy is the best Spurs have had in a long while - so much so that we have actually become quite distastefully spoilt.  The truth is we punched above our weight, which Levy deserves a lot of credit for, and now if we don't roll a team over in the first half, white heart lane is void of atmosphere  or support for the team.

Secondly, the idea that Levy is the problem, really then brings into question - what is his role?  I think it is really to keep us financially viable, whilst providing the maximum funds possible to support the clubs development.  That includes the squad, management and the new fucking stadium he's going for. We are an extremely well run club, always show profit, whilst never shying away from the transfer market. If you think Levy's done a bad job at that your mad, we make more money then ever before and go compare the squad and manager before he came in to the one now and tell me which one you think is better.


On this note - we complain that we sell out best players, but we don't get them from no where, Levy invests in youth and makes a pretty penny out of them.  The truth is we don't have the financial clout to mix is with the big boys, if you look at the relationship between money spent on wages and finishing place in the league, its a near linear relationship, and we don't have the stadium structure, fan base, european football or any other revenue to support us in spending the same amounts as the teams that have finished above us. 

So no Levy isn't the problem.  In fact, he makes decisions that are normally applauded by fans until they have the benefit of hindsight, then they get their nickers in a twist... These are the same fans who called for Harry's head for disloyalty, for AVB's head for not winning games with enough panache, Tim's head for leaving Sandro out and showing some passion, loved the 7 signings, before saying half to all should be sold less then a season later. 

Maybe, just maybe, the problem is Levy has hired men who are 'experts' (Baldini and AVB at the time) and trusted their judgment, made the signings, and they aren't as good as we thought they'd be... But that is not Levy's fault, he's doing his role like a boss. ",0,1415553859,null,0,false,0,clxjvdt,t3_2lrr9e,t1_clxjvdt,t3_2lrr9e,null,1426111525,54,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,54

Take the Wilton International former ICI site in the North East; every single company operating on that site is now non-UK owned. Now foreign investors don't like to take over a place and then take a hands off approach; they put their own management in place which includes sending some of their own employees from existing sites outside the UK. If immigration laws did not allow for this, the companies wouldn't invest and it would lead to a net loss in British jobs.

That being said, the vast majority of the workers there are British because believe it or not, hiring managers look at more than just wages when deciding who to hire, many companies have a preference for local workers to benefit the wider community (Particularly for entry level positions).",0,1415554178,null,0,false,0,clxk0rd,t3_2lo27f,t1_clxk0rd,t1_clwmbp8,null,1426111455,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Basically there's no place on the internet that will tell you if you're already a citizen or not.  It will tell you that you MIGHT be, but that's it.  Don't bother contacting one of the embassies; even if you manage to get someone on the phone, they'll just tell you that by law they aren't allowed to answer questions about citizenship.

It looks as though you're what's considered a citizen by descent, like me.  What you need to do now is apply for a UK passport.  [This site](https://www.gov.uk/apply-first-adult-passport/overview) is where you need to start. It will tell you exactly what you need to send in order to get your passport.

I was born in Quebec in 1987.  My mother was born in Winnipeg.  My dad was born in Glasgow.  I sent in my Canadian passport, Canadian birth certificate, my father's birth certificate, and my parents' marriage certificate. Two months later I got my British passport.  Under citizenship my passport says 'British citizen', which means I have the legal right to live and work in the UK.  I did not have to renounce my Canadian citizenship, so I am now a dual citizen.

In particular, ministers are only ever selected from MPs who know how to stick to the party line, and backbenchers will arguably never get into a position of power which will test their convictions, and/or allow them to have any actual impact. 

A politician will probably have some core, relatively specific, private principles that they wish to put into practice, and they hope that by compromising elsewhere, they will be able to get into a position to do some good in their area of interest, or generally to be able to shape things behind the scenes. 

In my opinion, one thing which needs to change, if we want a more moral system, is to increase the power of Parliament outside of just rubber stamping the actions of the current government or Prime Minister. Then you could have the possibility of normal MPs being able to exert real power and hold the government to account, while maintaining their principles, without having to climb to greasy pole into the Cabinet. There has actually been a fair amount of progress in this area recently, see [The Wright Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_Committee), for instance, heads of the Select Committees (which have the power to investigate and criticize the government) are now appointed by a secret ballot in Parliament, and not decided effectively by government whips, and Parliament now gets to decide some of what it will debate, rather than being told by the government.

Ok - this is an easy one. Find me a person who defended slavery in the 18th century who used the word ""race""?

Ruling tribes and peoples from the dawn of antiquity have chosen to believe in inferior peoples, cultures and religions. But they didn't have a strong concept of ""race"". 

Most of the defence of slavery before concepts of ""Race"" were popularised was based on Biblical authority about the story of Ham.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_Ham#European.2FAmerican_slavery.2C_17th_and_18th_centuries

You need Linnaeus to come up with taxinomy of species in the animal kingdom before you could even begin to popularise the concept scientific categories. 

You then further need Darwin to suggest there are battles of survival between stronger and weaker species before the idea explodes to the masses in the form of blood and soil political movements referred to above.

That's why, coupled with extension in popular franchise, you have at the same time the explosion in ethnic tensions in places like Greece and Turkey, Germany and Austria, and indeed Ireland. The burning of Protestant homes in Cork, Catholic homes in Belfast all takes place at the same time as Russian pogroms against Jews, and ethnic battles in the Balkans. Good Soldier Svejk is a humourous contemporary account of this rise in ethnic identity in the Balkans where previously trade, village and social status and been more predominant identity markers.

You adopting the 19th century belief that the Irish constitute a race is actually a bizarre adoption of spurious deep south american pseduo science reasoning for suppressing Irish immigrants. As non-white immigration increased suddenly it became a good idea to take them out of this made up categorisation as classify them as ""white"".

http://my.loudclick.net/Sites/3890/WWW/assets/images/IrishMonkey.bmp

Linda Colley's ""How the White Became Irish"" Is a good account of this.

Oh - you'll find ZERO reference to race in any Roman text by the way.

Again, they believed in inferior peoples, cultures and religions. They didn't believe in a concept of ""race"".

Not sure you're grasping the point.

Race is an invented concept.

The people in padeophile rings, are the ones who act on their urges, and molest and rape children, they deserve jailtime, and an attempt to reform them.

They cannot be reformed. The myth of the reformed paedophile is something that has been developed by paedophile apologists to fool people into pitying them. Making us think that they can be ""reformed"" is just another way for paedophiles to continue raping children. They can never be reformed, they have urges in the same way a lion has an urge to kill a gazelle. They enjoy raping children, they do it for the same reason we enjoy eating. They're only purpose in life is child rape. **Always** remember that.

Don't be fooled by the airy-fairy ""dey can b reformd"" shite.

Yes Lebanon takes in refugees, but Canada, Australia, Norway and even Spain all have higher net migration than the US. Which makes them more desirable than the US even if the US takes in more overall. Again quantity doesn't equal quality.

Some can be reformed, some can't. All it takes to reform them is to make sure they have good self control. You cannot generalize a whole group of people like that. 

Some paedophiles never act on their urges. Some do it regularly. Paedophiles live their lives like normal people, the only difference is that they are sexually attracted to children, it's not their fault, many do not want to be attracted to children. 

Guess what? I **do** pity a single type of paedophile - one who never acts on this, who are suicidal because of it, who *are* going to psychiatrists and getting all the help they can. The type of paedophile I do not pity are the type in the OP, the ones who act on their urges, the ones who are borderline sociopathic in their actions, the ones who don't have remorse.

Not really, since taxation is a specific subset of theft, specifically, that carried out by a nation state.

Just this whole season has been a groaner and just re-treads of things already  been touched upon.  The Doctors sudden ""extreme"" hatred for anyone military was so forced throughout the season just for the little speech he gives Danny was awful.

The bringing back of the master and making her even more insane and ridiculous is just a slap in the face for anyone who has been a doctor who fan and enjoyed the doctor/master dynamic.  The Master wasnt even that bad in the RTD run.

It's almost as if Moffat doesnt know how to write normal dialog for characters. Everyone needs to be talking fast pace with references and ""hip"" lingo or speak in non-sequiturs. 

The whole Clara lying about being the doctor shouldnt have fooled ANY cyberman they could tell that she only has one heart. 


The whole Danny/Clara thing was so uninteresting because we barely got any interaction with them as characters. Danny isnt a character, he is a plot point with barely any characterization. 

Moffat needs to take a page from RTD's book. The emotional you felt with Rose and Mickey was amazing.   

Amy and Rory were pretty bad but not as bad as Clara and Danny.

Now that doesn't mean they don't agree with the other moral point, they just believe the other is stronger. That means that while they believe that people have the right to keep their own money, it doesn't mean they disagree with the idea that we have some duty to contribute.

Now that requires a separate poll, but that fact your trying to compare how people compare morals to gang rape is pretty odd (although im not hear to discuss your interests).

Anyway they might feel that public services should be paid by us to some degree, ie people's duty to pay for police and fireman and medical services wages but not NHS expenditure, hence morally they weigh it lower then keeping your own money.

What I did was transfer money to a family member's account so they could do the wire transfer from their account to my bank account in the UK once it was ready. Maybe look into doing the same: find someone in the US willing to hold some of your money, get a bank account in the UK and the details, give the US person your wire transfer details, and they'll go and wire transfer your money to your UK account. 

This way, according to my bank, you are receiving 100% of the exchange rate amount, minus the set transaction fee.

I 'discovered' Chelsea over time in Sydney during my first years at University. Out of my mates at uni, one followed newcastle, one followed Arsenal and one followed Liverpool and i'd sat through many of arguments during class time about who the better players were and whilst I hadn't found a club to follow i'd always been a fan of the game. One particular night we were out on the town in George St (the ol' Ace Bar, this dungeon-ey pub in the main street in Sydney that sold dirty cheap alcohol) and the premier league happened to be on, I remember it like yesterday...It was pissing down raining outside and after a couple of schooners it was getting quite rowdy...Chelsea were about to play Watford in the EPL and the bar was getting lots of people coming in to watch the game..we weren't keen on leaving and so watched it all...I didn't know much about chelsea but during the time but this game in particular Drogba scored a spectacular hatrick and so whenever we went out for drinks or to the casino to watch games i'd always keep an eye on how chelsea were doing....over time I really grew to like Mourinho, Lampard, Ballack but particularly Drogba...just had this amazing energy...before the year was out and after getting myself a foxtel (cable TV) subscription to follow the games, it'd dawned that I had found my team:) 
Went from there...2010, I managed to come over to London for the first time and caught league cup games against newcastle that ended up 4-3 in newcastles favour, and a 2-0 win over marseille in the champions league. I moved to london in 2012 and have seen countless games since. The champions league final of that year is the most special game I think i've seen. Next year will be my first with a season ticket and I look forward to see how far mourinho can take this club in the future and the prospects of a larger stadium:D

No problem. I'll explain it:

You said:

Presumably as a justification for taxation. Most people like the system, so it's OK.

I raised the counter point of gang rape, most participants like it, but I don't think that makes it OK, and I suspect you wouldn't either.

My point? Having consent of a majority of a group is not good justification for immoral acts.

I've been attempting to show you that there's not been any moral justification presented for taxation in this thread thus far which holds any weight.

I'm searching for one, and I have been for years.

false,TrenchLordKaede,null,null,"the senate is supposed to give disproportionate representation to the smaller, less populated states. they have two houses of government, one of which has its seats allocated based on population and the other gives out the same # of seats to all states. 

whatever perceived problems with the presidential electoral college giving disproportionate representation to smaller states might exist are largely insignificant considering the fact that most states are extremely stable in who they vote for at presidential elections and the election depends on the swing states. virtually no importance is given to sparsely populated states like wyoming when deciding states like florida and ohio are actually being contested.

i don't know where you are getting this ""16% of the rural population runs half the senate"" figure from; presumably the smallest 25 states amount to 16% of the population, but the implications of that statement are really untrue because people in hawaii, vermont and rhode island (40th, 49th and 43rd in terms of population) largely vote the complete opposite way to people in the two dakotas and alaska (46th-48th in terms of population).and even if the 25 smallest states were republican strong holds, and 16% of the population got senate majorities over 84% of the population, then the senate wouldn't be functioning poorly; its job is to ensure that the will of the people in small states isnt completely marginalised by those in bigger states, and that decisions arent made that constantly throw the smaller states under the wheel.

the objection that a lot of americans have towards ""obamacare"" is that (as another commenter has said) they already have massively funded government programmes like social security, veterans benefits, etc. but they are all run so horrendously badly. americans already spent far more money per person on health care and yet their life expectancy is not significantly higher than other developed nations. a lot of people are worried that ""obamacare"" is going to turn into another ridiculous money sink with good intentions but administrated so poorly that it's not worth the money. the people who think that poor people don't deserve healthcare and you should have to earn the right to be healthy are who the media will focus on, and they undoubtedly make up a worrying size of the population, but people with legitimate concerns about socialized programmes in the US are not fictitious. running social programmes in a counter of 300 million with significant devolution and huge areas with low population is far, far harder than running social programmes in countries like the UK or germany where virtually nobody is further than a 1.5 hour drive from a hospital capable of carrying out whatever procedure is necessary.

&gt;Public pensions are a time bomb waiting to blow.    
&gt; Have a look at the % of council tax going towards public sector pensions. It's already a significant proportion and will continue rising for a while yet.

The problem, such as it is, arises in respect of state pensions.

Public sector pensions aren't really as generous as you've been told over and over, as long as a state pension exists.

The maximum **[amount of a state pension](https://www.gov.uk/state-pension/what-youll-get)** is 
£113.10.  Additionally you may qualify for the State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme (SERPS).  SERPS is important here because anyone on a final salary scheme were contracted out and therefore**didn't** qualify for SERPS.  This means no one with a public sector pension (under the old final salary rules) qualifies for it.

Either way, this brings us to the **[Minimum Income Guarantee](https://www.gov.uk/pension-credit/overview)** which is £148.35 for single people or £226.50 for couples.

All this means that you have a minimum state pension'ish income of £7,714.20 a year.

The final salary schemes offered by the public sector paid 50% of your final salary.  This assumes you worked long enough.  Per the **[Hutton Report](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11466273)**, ""the average pension in payment currently at a ""modest"" £7,800 a year. Around half of public service pensioners received less than £5,600 a year.""  So...  Half of public sector pensioners are under MIG and the average is about £2 a week more.

Finally the percentage thing is highly misleading.  Civil Service pensions don't accrue a pension pot.  That is if you work in the Civil Service what you pay in is just expended to pay for someone else's pension.  All you have as a Civil Servant is a promise that one day you'll get a pension.  The public sector has been shrinking, so the number of people paying in shrinks.  HMRC, for example, has shed around 60,000 staff in the last eight years.  Since the balance has to be topped up, that's where you get the sort of cost you refer to.",0,1415560074,null,0,false,0,clxn2zl,t3_2lr199,t1_clxn2zl,t1_clxglzl,null,1426110028,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Against teams like this, who are able to press high, and get past our midfield easily, it makes sense to play Lucas.

At the end of the game, where Chelsea sat off, that is when Gerrard came into the game and took control. He doesn't have the physical ability to do it vs players like Oscar/Ramires/Hazard. No shame in that he's 34 ffs.

We had more control vs Madrid with Lucas. If we were playing a weaker team then Gerrard is better.

The bit I'm really critical of is that reverse pass Oscar played to Ramires, he should see that run, it's not his game but we are suffering for it.

When we had two strikers with great movement, we could buy Gerrard space, and his direct passing was extremely valuable. If we are struggling to score goals, we should play a more defensively sound DM in Lucas.

It's tough to accept, but I am convinced we need to play Lucas now, more than dropping Gerrard.

Stick with virgin, you won't get a better connection/price. If it's a student houseshare then the bottleneck with your speeds will be your hardware.  Cheap laptops have awful wireless cards in them.  

Get ethernet cables hooked to the hub and you'll have no complaints.  It's what I do.  4 people sharing 40mb but i can still happily game online, stream music or download movies/series without a problem.

There was an excerpt from Suarez' book posted here last week where he described Rodgers' plan for Liverpool's style of play. It emphasised playing the ball out from the back on the ground with constantly moving midfielders opening up space. Lovren, I've noticed, prefers to hoof it long. Balotelli will sometimes be able to take it down and hold the ball up, but we have a very short midfield that struggles to win balls in the air. 

Basically, a huge amount of cheap possession losses are coming from Lovren's long balls. He's not Gerrard or even Henderson, he cannot pull that off and it means we lose possession so quickly. I saw him do it twice yesterday from the left back position, so not only was he booting it long and losing it, he was also out of position when he was doing so.

**Personal Observations**

- Montero is a night mare for any defender on his day.

- Bartley really stepped up to the challenge. How spoiled are we at Centre-Back if he can consistently play like that!

- Ashley Williams is the heart of this team. What a cool head he has, some of his clearances are far more difficult than he makes them seem. Class.

- Siggy was pretty well shut down by Flamini until the free kick. Had Montero not become Hazard today we might not have looked nearly as good. His free kick however made me question my own sexuality.

- As the top comment in /r/Gunners put it. ""Watch out for Wilfried, he is no one-trick Bony"" What a presence he is. 

- Barrow is one to watch. Might we have 4 PL quality wingers?

- Ki and Carroll quietly dictated the tempo all game. 

- Other than a shit show on a counter, Fabianski and our back line did a fantastic job getting the ball out. It looks sloppy, but the way our wingers were playing and with Bony as target man those clearances often quickly became counters.

**What to take from this game**

- What season. In Monk we trust.

- Anyway we can sign Carroll permanently? I feel like he could learn a lot getting tutored by Britton

- Montero needs to calm down this close to the transfer window.

- WE BEAT ARSENAL.

Very American expression, i myself am a product of the state school system, I tend to subscribe to the belief that we are not all born equal. Everything from Intelligence to Body shape is largely decided by what your  parents hand down to you.. 

True, wealthy kids get an obscene head start in this country which is bullshit, but my comprehensive had a few smart kids a few dumb ones and alot of average ones 

if you look at where they are now, you could have roughly predicted it at the end of year 7. Seriously. The thick girls have kids and don't work, the smart few are careerists with husbands who work as well, and the others do okayish, solidly working class (in that they actually do work)

it's so predictable. I find it galling we have to pretend that these people born without anything remarkable about them, are capable of remarkable things and *if not* well then they are placed on benefits and told to spend this. (capital moves very quickly in the hands of the jobless, they consume more and save less) which was largely the argument used to get the right on board with the benefit system in the first place.

Americans are much more likely to be in favour of local taxes.  I grew up in a rural part of middle america that is very conservative but local taxes for the local school districts almost always passed when put up for election.   Even conservatives believe in funding things that are good for society such as good schools and US schools are the highest funded in the world on average, but most of that funding comes from the state and local taxes, not from federal taxes.  

Here is another example: The local road improvements sale tax in the conservative city I used to live in was set up that it had to be renewed every 5 years by voters and it was always one of the most popular taxes and easily passed every 5 years because the voters had trust in the program, if the same sales tax would have been proposed as a permanent tax it would have failed badly.

Because you asked nicely I will do so.

Point: The relationship from wealth to utility is not linear, most likely it is sigmoidal.

Argument: £5 to a millionaire represents a small increase or decrease to their standard of living, the same £5 to a poor person might mean the difference between missing a meal or not, a large change to their standard of living

Conclusion: From this it should be obvious that utility w.r.t money is not zero sum because by moving small amounts of financial power from some individuals to other individuals can result in a net-gain in utility. The amount which is appropriate to transfer is debatable, but the fact the amount is &gt;0 should be obvious.

Point: Financial success is not perfectly correlated with hard work, circumstance plays a large role.

Argument: Office workers on 40hr weeks in general make more than people who have multiple service/manual labour jobs despite doing fewer hours of work which is less physically draining.
People who's parents went to private school then oxbridge then landed a good job are much more likely than the general population to go to private school then oxbridge then land a good job.
The same principal applies to poverty.

Conclusion: Asserting that unaltered wealth distribution is morally superior because people who work harder have a ""right"" to their money is a flawed concept. I will concede that moeny is a strong motivating factor and productive individuals should be motivated to produce via financial inducement, but that is not incompatible with taxation because:

false,chiarochurro,lfc99,,"Damn. This is harsh but true. Gerrard more often than not gets caught out-and although he will always try to make up, we obviously cannot keep playing like this if we're ever to improve. Another alarming point is Henderson's lack of real involvement in this 'dirty' side of the (his) game, something Matic was rightly praised for. 

Our team at the moment feels very 'Arsenal' like-- we invest on attacking flair and quick movement but absolute shambles at the back. No strong DM--someone more proactive that lucas or allen next to Henderson. Forget Schniederlin, we need someone like Wanyama if we insist on 2 or even 3 man midfield imo. 

Gerrard's passing does not compensate for his lack of defensive cover. If BR is to insist on playing Stevie weekly (which I think he should) it should be something like Pirlo in Juventus. Thing is, the two players either side of him--Vidal and Pogba-- are two of the most technically sound and physically imposing players who support, score goals, defend with tackles and block the 90 mins. Unfortunate Allen falls short, Lucas seems out of it, and Coutinho/Lallana should be played higher up anyway. Henderson could take up one side--he is getting better and better, so the clearest option for the other side should be Can, if we aren't going to buy a DM that could come STRAIGHT INTO THE SIDE (something Rodgers should do a little more of...like Mourinho. 

The onus to shield the back 4 should not really fall on Gerrard, is my point. He takes much of the blame when he needs engines on either side to cover for his brilliance going forward. It's like he's needed to be two players in one which keeps him from excelling in one phase more than the other.

He didn't let Clara go immediately for two reasons: 1.) he felt an obligation out of the residual feelings of his previous incarnation, and 2.) he needed to learn about who he was by seeing himself reflected in someone he trusted.

He knew early on that he was working from a much more blank slate than his previous three (4?) incarnations, and the itch in his brain that made him wonder why he was ever in the position he found himself eventually gave way to a resignation that this separation was inevitable.

Missy threw Clara in to that role because she knew that Clara would continue to press the Doctor to do more and more to save his charges, and that it would force him in to a role that should have ""revealed"" to him that he was much more like Missy than he would have cared to imagine. The handing over of an army to the Doctor was the next logical step in his need to save the universe, and an action that crystallized to him what it is that makes him different.

To me, that is the development in the character of the Doctor, and every other character in this series was merely a way for him to relearn himself.

false,01two,null,null,"Renting gives you flexibility to move in the future. However, and I say this a landlord, you are paying for someone else to own an asset that (should!) benefit from positive cashflow and capital appreciation in future.

In your situation I would look to buy a flat or house. You need to work out your budget and make sure you have money on hand for the deposit and costs.

In the current market in and around Glasgow, 400pcm +bills is about right for rent - bills will run you around 150pcm, so call it 550pcm.

Purchase costs vary; assuming a 90% LTV mortgage on a 50k property then you would need Deposit (5k) +solicitor fees (inc searches) (around 600-800) + survey costs (125-400) + mortgage fee (around 500), total ~6,700 pounds.

A 5k deposit and a 90% LTV repayment mortgage at 5% over 25 years would cost 266.67pcm. (You'd need to speak to an independant IFA to get some proper advice specific to your circumstances). If you add 150pcm for bills, it should be cheaper than rent, plus you own a house you're paying off (little by little) each and every month.

In future, if you need to move, don't sell! Rent it out (remortgage to a BTL mortgage). Assuming you don't take out any equity, you leave it as a repayment mortgage and your tenant, paying 400pcm as well as their own bills, now covers the cost and any maintenance and some positive cashflow left over. You can increase cashflow by switching to interest only too, but this will be a decision you'd make in the future. 

If you go down this route, a couple of further thoughts...
1. consider taking in a housemate - they'll help pay the bills and mortgage
2. work out what it would cost to rent - pay the difference every month into a savings account. Ideally, this would then become part of your deposit for when you want buy your next house, or move to a different area.
3. You can find furniture packs for landlords - a 2 bed can be furninshed for around 1000 including white goods. It won't be fantastic looking, but it will be functional!

I didn't buy my own home until 10 years after I graduated and with hindsight I wish I'd done it a lot earlier. The key bit is to gather to deposit and purchase costs etc and not go into debt on a credit card.

If you end up on the east side of Guildford (e.g. Merrow, Burpham), travel time will be about 30 min at peak times, even though it's only 4-5 miles, because you can't easily join the A3 westbound. South side is relatively expensive, and you have to get across town so it'll likely take even longer.

North of the A3 is cheaper, but watch out for the dodgy council estates (e.g. Park Barn). I ended up in the Broadacres/Oakfields area, which is lovely.

Anywhere with easy access to the A3 (e.g. west or further east) will have relatively quick journey times, but be aware that it can take some time (up to 15 min) to get out of SRP, even with the new junction. Some of my colleagues work 7:30 - 4:30 to avoid this problem.

Alternatively, pretty much anywhere in Guildford is in cycling range, which avoids most of these problems. Cycle provision is not particularly good however; there are some nasty junctions.

I think many of the current problems are based completely in fear, loyalists fearing that a united Ireland would destroy their culture or republicans fearing that the past will repeat itself.

I honestly think a lot of 'traditions' need to change in this country with the parades being one of them (the bonfires are al right, only a few troublemakers burn the tricolour and do things to deliberately annoy republicans). I don't want the parades to stop but they have to become more inclusive so that republications can join in and feel like the parade isn't a middle finger raised at them and their ancestors. I understand how its a very hard thing to approach because any change to tradition makes them start fearing the loss of culture that could happen but politicians are ultimately making it worse by telling them they are right to fear change so that they get their votes instead of telling them to believe in the people of Northern Ireland.

It will fade with time but ultimately we should be encouraging cross community activities to the point where it becomes one community against sectarianism and agree to disagree over politics because we care for the future of our country and every person in it regardless of gender, race and religion.

Since her original arc was the impossible girl, having been born to save the Doctor, not once, not twice, but in EVERY ONE OF HIS LIVES, it's hard to understand why fans hate her...because according to Moffat &amp; Co., if it weren't for Clara, ""the impossible girl"", the Doctor would've died multiple times, in a few cases neve to regenerate. Why hate the companion who has been written to save the Doctor repeatedly? It makes no sense, she's earned the Doctors respect, why not yours? 

Clara has been a girl w/ a wifi problem, a barmaid, a governess, a teacher at Coal Hill, a companion to the Doctor, a young woman in love &amp; in each incarnation she's performed beautifully. 

In the beginning she challenged the Doctor &amp; she challenges him now STILL. She's never been that floozy type of companion trying to ""get it on"" with him like Amy Pond. The only exception would be Clara the barmaid/governess where the admiration felt mutual. But an Amy Pond type? NO.

false,Sheph1220,null,null,"Ok. Here is my opinion on the finale. Part one, Dark Water, was an excellent build up which made very good use of screen time to set part two up to be pure gold... and then part two happened and they managed to turn pure gold into a steaming pile of poo in record time. I did like some things though, so I'll go over what I think.

1) Clara is easily the most boring companion ever when there is no mystery about her. She was an awesome character when we didn't know who she was, but once she became a normal human, she is so terribly bland. So opening the finale with her being the Doctor... it brought the mystery back and made her a thousand times more interesting again. It was an excellent way to open the show, with the change in the credits and everything. I couldn't help but think of Matt Smith saying, ""That's the point, there's only me here"" in his timeline. Well Clara was there, so shouldn't that mean that Clara is the Doctor, too? So much potential, such a great scene. But then they did absolutely nothing with it. Instead it was wasted screen time to throw us a red herring in the previews.

2) They ended the last episode with Danny choosing whether to delete his emotions and a glimpse of that boy. Some people didn't see it, so they are left clueless when the first scene Danny is in is with the boy. What the hell happened? They could have given us some connection and it would have been quality stuff. Good screen time, low budget.

3) The rain cloud/pollenation. I'm not even going to talk about how flawed this is. Handwaving is acceptable when we get a good moment out of it. This led to nothing, served no purpose, and was shoved down our throats.

4) We're sort of beating a dead horse with the whole humans are morons with their military protocols... we get it. The Doctor as president... ugh we get it. It felt like they just did that to put the Doctor into a deeper hole than he already was.  Believe me he was deep enough. it would still have taken the rest of the episode to get out of it if they didn't end it like they did in 2 seconds.

5) Why did Danny bring Clara to the graveyard? I can think of absolutely no logical reason, other than its an interesting set location to film... which it wasn't.

6) Osgood. Ok after the Doctor said ""all of time and space"", I squealed in glee like seb, and then Missy kills her. Besides the two guards, this scene was pretty good. As awesome as it would be to have her as a companion, you needed to do it to successfully crush my heart. Good job.

7) I don't believe Clara can go to being so confident she loves Danny to saying the doctor is the closest thing to her. This has bad writing written all over it in Comic Sans. Another example of Clara being absolutely boring companion with no depth.

8) Danny as a Cyberman was truly horrifying. If you think about it... if they had done more groundwork in the beginning of the episode this could have paid off even more. But good job nonetheless.

9) Doctor falling into the Tardis. Super corny, but super awesome. This is a case where the handwaving is acceptable because you know everyone was smiling.

10) Danny wasn't really winning his conversation against the Doctor at the end, so I don't know why the doctor caved in. The show didn't even explore other possibilities... the doctor just assumed converting Danny was the only way. This is not like the Doctor at all. Bad writing.

false,domalino,logo,,"Im not going to argue for or against him coming back, because I don't think it will happen. However I feel like pointing out a few things to people who are writing him off completely.

Firstly - people keep bringing up Stoke. Forget it. He was only 6 months back from stepping onto a training ground after his injury and he looks physically much much stronger now than he was last season. Plus obviously needed 4 or 5 games to get into even the slightest bit of form, and Hughes couldn't afford that because he was in a relegation battle.

Secondly, people writing him off, go watch one of Celtic's games online.  Having seen several this season, you can just see that Guidetti is a completely different player to the guy on our preseason tour. And for comparisons of quality, we played some pretty poor teams in preseason, worse than SPL level.

Its not even his scoring record, its just everything about his game you can see is improved. Physically he is faster and stronger, but technically he is on a different world. In the summer he couldn't do anything, his first touch was poor, his passes were terrible, finishing was non existant.

I see Guidetti like Ramsey was post injury. He came back and took over a year to start playing well again for Arsenal. They both were out for  nearly 2 seasons and it took them almost as long to come back to some sort of form. I don't think Guidetti will be the world class player he could have been, but I do think he could still be very good. Maybe good enough for a CL team.  

Having said all that, he's no going to be good enough in January to play regularly ahead of Dzeko/Jovetic, so there's no point bringing him back and probably ruining his resurgence. Not to mention he probably wants to stay in Celtic himself - they have Taco nights.

-Barrow looks good.  He certainly has speed and also cleaned up his mistakes defensively.  And I think he usually plays on the left, so if Montero picks up an injury this season, I'd like to see Modou get some more minutes.

-It was great to see Britton back in action.  It'll be interesting to see how much he plays going forward because he'll have to compete with Jonjo and Carroll, but I think he supplies a good middle ground between Shelvey's erratic play and Carroll's safety.

-I think the Williams/Bartley pairing needs a little work.  Arsenal's goal was good, but there was also a marking miscommunication between the CB's.  

-Gylfi's freekick was insane, as were Montero's runs.  But can Montero replicate his performance against Sagna?  I don't know.

-I still can't believe that Bafetimbi Gomis plays for Swansea

It sums up the neoconservative dogma from the Reagan era pretty well, Thatcher was a fan as we both know.

&gt;Very American expression, i myself am a product of the state school system, I tend to subscribe to the belief that we are not all born equal. Everything from Intelligence to Body shape is largely decided by what your parents hand down to you.. 

&gt;True, wealthy kids get an obscene head start in this country which is bullshit, but my comprehensive had a few smart kids a few dumb ones and alot of average ones 

I went to a state comprehensive as well, for my sins. There were a lot of kids there who didn't have a hope in hell of achieving much beyond staying out of prison because of what their parents handed down to them. The distribution of smart / average is about the same for every state school, private and public schools tend to get a more dedicated lot.

&gt;if you look at where they are now, you could have roughly predicted it at the end of year 7. Seriously. The thick girls have kids and don't work, the smart few are careerists with husbands who work as well, and the others do okayish, solidly working class (in that they actually do work)

Mm... Ours is a mixed bag. I've moved away from the area (deliberately avoiding it more like) so I haven't run into many of them since leaving school. As far as I know they all went off in all different directions. On average, people will do averagely, I guess that's going to be the expectation. Anything more is unusual given their backgrounds.

&gt;it's so predictable. I find it galling we have to pretend that these people born without anything remarkable about them, are capable of remarkable things and if not well then they are placed on benefits and told to spend this. (capital moves very quickly in the hands of the jobless, they consume more and save less) which was largely the argument used to get the right on board with the benefit system in the first place.

You don't need to explain MPC to me :) Many people are born 'bright' as in they pick things up quickly, but that doesn't get you anywhere without hard work backing you up. Reddit is full of 'smart lazy' people who think they're the mutts nuts but it doesn't mean anything without graft behind it. I know I'm lazy so I work hard on not being lazy, to various levels of success...

The kids who tried hard and put the effort in can easily end up surpassing the 'smart' people because they end up in the right place at the right time with the right set of skills. It's getting that message across to young people as well as creating a culture of reward for *achieving* things rather than perceptions of effort or because you're 'naturally smart'. Looking back I hate that I was called smart because actually I did try hard in some things, and other things just came easily to me. It got me into bad habits when I came up against things that I couldn't grasp easily or quickly because my work ethic was far below what it needed to be.

This is just my opinion, so please, don't get all up and arms because I don't agree with you. I understand some people love this season, and even love this season finale, but in the words of all those white girls out there...I can't even. This episode was just utter garbage. It was predictable (I saw about 5 posts on FB before it aired where people were calling Danny becoming a cyberman and turning against the programming), anti-climatic, random as hell in some ways (the general being able to disregard the programming as well, catch his daughter, stay behind, disobeying Dan's commands, shoot the Master for the Doctor, and then fly off and blow up), corny as hell in some ways (Danny's speech...my god please stop), and just not fun at all. Like I said, I understand if some of you disagree. I just can't get over how boring this episode was. The only person to blame is Moffat, and I honestly shouldn't have expected much else from the guy, but god damn man, seriously? You end a companionship on some lies? And don't even try to tell me that they're done being partners, you left the door wide open for Clara to come back, at least one last time, which I hate because Clara is the worst companion the Doctor has ever had. Also, how about the teasers for this finale? ""Old friends return to help the Doctor!""...old friends? You mean all those people that had 5 minutes of screen time only to be killed by the Master immediately due to some SEVERE incompetence (I'm looking at you guards behind the Master). Shit, I had to remind myself who the hell a couple of these ""friends"" were. I was waiting for something huge to solidify some kind of awesome-ness to this season like Captain Jack showing up, or Jenny, or Mickey and Martha, fuck even the Lizard-Lady trio WHO WE HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN SINCE THE FIRST GOD DAMN EPISODE! I just don't get it. This season has been the most inconsistent, random season thus far. The overall plot was such a let-down, the only saving grace of the season so far was Michelle Gomez's performance as the Master, but guess what? She's dead (presumably) from the cyber-beam of a nobody...great. You could have at least dedicated some more screen time for this awesome actress. She was truly diabolical, and as much as I hated her dying, when Missy killed Osgood I was honestly nervous for the rest of the cast. My thought process was along the lines of ""Oh shit Missy don't give no fucks"", but after that (and kicking blondie off the plane) she's never truly ""evil"" again and her reveal of why she chose Clara, and why she made a Cyberman Army were just lame as hell. I was waiting for some kind of connection to the Impossible Girl, especially with Clara screaming she never existed in the preview, or some kind of big twist that puts the Doctor in a very tough spot. Nope. She made the army for the Doctor, who after thinking for less than 1 minute realizes exactly what must be done, does it, and the episode is over. Soooo...how'd the Master get off Gallifrey? Why did Moffat have the Doctor and Clara cut it off based on a lie? He wrote the damn script so badly he had the Doctor just completely interrupt Clara when she clearly says ""I have to tell you something"". Maybe the Doctor already knew and didn't want her to say it so he could be ""single"", but who the hell knows. Moffat tries too hard to leave it up to the imagination when these are things that need to be hashed out on screen, not in our heads where we question everything he just did. I just don't get it, I don't get the direction, the idea, or even the motivation behind this stale excuse for a finale, let alone a season. I mean, cybermen? For real? There's nothing else horrifyingly evil out there in the wide expanse of the Universe that the Doctor could face? I'm sorry, like I said, I know a lot of you liked it, but it just didn't make sense to me, and I honestly couldn't stand the cringy-ness of this episode, especially Dan's speech to the friggin cybermen....like he was their leader or some shit...so friggin stupid.

Okay, /endrant. Sorry for the long post.

TL;DR: I thought this episode was shit. Along with most of the season.

Edit: I forgot to add one last gripe. Danny leaves a random, presumably, Afghan, or Iraqi, kid on Clara's doorstep that she's knows NOTHING about because they never really got around to developing his background that much. So now Clara is stuck with some random child she has no idea where he's from, who his family was (because you know damn well they're probably dead now too, thanks Dan), and they literally leave that part of the story right there where it begins, with him stepping outta the portal. What happens to the kid? No idea, don't care apparently. And let's just talk about this kid being in the Nethersphere anyways; I thought Missy went back in time and ""collected"" all of the people the Doctor had defeated, left behind, and so on, so why in the world was the kid that Danny shot in Iraq/Afghanistan in the Nethersphere? Makes no sense, unless the Master knew all along about Danny Pink and wanted to make his 30 minutes in the afterlife that much more depressing. IT MAKES NO SENSE!!!

Can't agree with that. What cabletel did is exactly the same as what Virgin do now, in fact Virgin Media is to all intents and purposes, Cabletel. Cabletel bought NTL once NTL had been privatised and rebranded as NTL. NTL then bought Virgin Media and rebranded again.

I don't think any backline would be comfortable with Gerrard covering them, and it's blatantly obvious too. He's not a defensive mid and I would like to see us go with Henderson there, and let Can take over Hendersons role. 

Our defenders seem confused as to exactly how they should deal with situations. This is not down to their quality, this is down to poor coaching and management. You see teams with sub par defenders play a good organised defensive game all the time, it isn't magic. 

In the end, the whole of the problem is the entire way our team is working. When one vital part fails to be productive, the entire team fails as well. Our players also look less hungry this year, and work ethics seem to have taken a turn for the worse.

In particular, they soft-pedal on right-wing economic policy because it might damage their appeal to working class voters.

false,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; The state pension isn't of any great significance as far as I'm aware in terms of tax burden?

The state pension (including forms like Minimum Income Guarantee which in the strictest sense is a benefit, rather than a pension) is something in the order of £150bn a year.  It's about 20% of state spending.

It's a larger sum than healthcare by about £9bn and it's not far from being 150% of what gets spent on defence.

Edit:  Adding in a source and a little analysis:

Per the government's Public Expenditure Statistical Analysis for 2014 (which you can find **[here](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/330717/PESA_2014_-_print.pdf)**):

I may have overstated the cost of pensions a bit.  £143.2bn, rather than £150bn.    
It's not an insignificant overstatement, but I think you'll agree the actual spend is a huge amount of money.

Sickness and disability pensions:  £37.8bn    
Old age pensions:  £104.3bn    
Survivors' pensions:  £1.1bn

What this means is that in every pound spent by the state more than 26p is spent on pension provision.

I couldn't readily find a figure for public sector pensions.  What I did find was an **[article from the Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2300877/Gold-plated-public-sector-pensions-set-cost-family-1-500.html)**, which I think we can agree probably doesn't understate the figures.  They claimed that by 2017/18 the cost of public sector pensions could rocket to £16.2bn.

So, let's use that figure and ignore the possibility that it's inflated and that it's a future figure.  That would mean £16.2bn for public-sector pensions and the residue of £127bn for other pensions.  So, even using those figures public sector pensions are about 11.3% of all pension expenditure.

This would mean that for every £1 spent by the state:    
3p for public sector pensions.    
23p for other pensions.

A couple tips: one, you gotta train him to know what ""No!"" means. When he does something wrong, smack him in the snout (hard enough for him to feel it and be taken aback, but not nearly hard enough to actually hurt him) and say no very firmly and a little louder than your normal voice. After a little while, you can remove the snout smack and just say no, and he'll stop whatever he's doing. Two, train him not to beg for people food. My cat knows not to even be up on my lap or the couch when I'm eating. Three, you HAVE teach him not to scratch up just anything. Get him a good scratching post, and if you see him scratching *anything* else, smack his nose, then pick him up and put him next to the scratching post. You could even take his paw and make him scratch the post, showing him it's okay. 

Litter box training is super simple: if you see him looking around for a place to go potty, or catch him doing so on the ground, carry him to the litter box and us your hand to scratch at the litter.

At night i'd get my full 100Mb, between 3 and 10 or so in the evening i'd only get ~40Mb and would have _massive_ latency spikes, sometimes every couple of minites, my ping to telia would go from ~60 to ~1600 ms and stay that was for about 15 seconds, during that time the route would go from 9 hops to 38 or so, including jumping around from manchester to london about 5 times with an MTU of something like 64 bits, which caused a _lot_ of retransmits.

That's obviously a switch here shifting some connections off to a secondary route and that secondary route being really fucking stupid but I could never get the techs to escalate it to their actualy network engineers because it only happened for a few minutes and.""[their] tests show no problems on the line""

I got a tech out to the hoise a couple of times and became quite friendly, which is how I found out how massively oversubscribed belfast is.

For the record it wasn't just me that saw this, a couple of friends in the same bit of town had the same issue. It got to be a running joke when one of us went offline the other 2 would be gone in about 10 seconds. It was not conducive to multiplayer gaming.
