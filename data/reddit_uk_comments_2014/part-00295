That's what seems weird to me about the pro-blowing-up-the-moon people...How is setting off 100 nuclear bombs any *less* dangerous than it simply hatching?

As for what I liked...I was particularly into the dynamic between Clara and the Doctor in this episode. And I liked the moral dilemma that Clara had to face, one that wasn't as clear-cut as many people on this thread seem to think. What kind of decisions do terrified people make when the outcome is a complete unknown?

As it was, the planet was already in danger, and major catastrophes had already occurred. Blowing up the moon was a last ditch effort, with an uncertain outcome of its own. There were no easy answers in this episode, and that's something I particularly enjoyed.

(2) Balotelli dropped being a ""big decision"". It's not a big decision as in an obvious decision. BR took Mario out of the firing line, gave Lambert a run out, and it is obvious that his 60th min intro was planned.

Based on the information given to us we were led to believe that the choice was this creature or all of humanity. That choice is clear-cut. If the choice was something else, the writing did not reflect it very well for the majority of people on this website.

If Clara had made this point I would have much more respect for the writing during this episode. She didn't. At no point was it implied by any character that setting off 100 nuclear bombs on Earth would be a danger for the Earth.

The Doctor at times has also been extremely aloof while also being pretty clever (Two, Eight, and early Seven). The Doctor has not always been able to wave a magic wand an save the day, and sometimes he utterly fails (Warriors of the Deep being one of the most notable examples). At the end of the day the Doctor is one person with flaws who despite his own experiences is still pretty much making it up as he goes along.

The Doctor has both an enormous ego while simultaneously being pretty insecure about his own actions. He often uses wit and guided insults or manic happiness to hide these insecurities. Him hating/disliking Danny is a combination of this ego (how can Clara choose to spend time with someone else) and his own insecurities (over his own past as a ""soldier""), as well as his own dislike of soldiers as a group.

The core element of the Doctor is his childlike and reckless sense of curiosity. And we have seen Capaldi exhibit this in spades (his excitement over the nanoscaler, his excitement over the fact that everyone might have had the same dream, his excitement over there being Robots in Sherwood, his excitement over being undercover, his excitement over the moon being a living creature). The Doctor's adventuring and curiosity isn't always a positive and happy affair and has even gotten companions killed in the past.

I feel the Doctor left Clara on the moon because he wanted her to make the decision. When Danny said that he was an officer sending Clara into fires that he sets and that she does whatever he says without considering her own safety or without fear, the Doctor actually listened and took his advice. He gave Clara the ultimate choice without his interference and without telling her what to do. He also wants to see if he can trust these kinds of decisions to someone else. He wants to share the burdens of his decisions with his companion and hopes Clara can understand him better and sympathize.

Then came the Third Doctor where most of his early stories were set in and around modern day Britain because of his exile.

The reason why a lot of the alien invasions centered around Britain in the early years could be because of the Hand of Omega (a Gallifreyan device/weapon that the Doctor hid on Earth during his First Incarnation although this is back-dating because we didn't know about it until his Seventh incarnation) and because of the Artron emissions left by the Doctor landing his TARDIS there many times (also back-dating because we learned of this tendency to draw aliens only more recently).

They never drew attention to the masks and the whole cast studiously avoided mentioning the plywood walls of the caves and dungeons, They never drew attention the fact that half the universe looked like a gravel pit in the English country side. And as a viewer I went along with the charade. I could and did happily turn off my brain for the run time of show. The story was great and the effects were secondary. It was brilliant scifi done on a shoe string budget.

*BUT* if you make the moons gravity a central point of your plot, you had better make an effort to pay attention to stuff about the moons gravity. If you draw attention to it in the beginning of the episode and say its massive city destroying tides, you don't then finish the episode parking the *Tardis on a Beach Under the Moon* without people naturally saying 'Hey where is the massive city destroying high tide?' They could have parked on a building,a field a mountain a road an absolutely anywhere without the ocean in the background, but no, they parked it right in front of a plot hole as if they wrote the end without reading the beginning.

If you are going to make a big thing about the spider things Not being spiders but single cell life forms and therefor bacteria, you don't then ignore every thing about single cell organisms And still have spider webs all over the moon.

 They wrote a story that not even the writers bothered to pay attention to, but I'm the picky one for noticing and getting a bit annoyed about it.

And even then It would not be a problem if it wasn't for the fact that this episode was swiss cheesed with stuff like this. I shrugged off four or five before they crashed a shuttle on the moon without breaching the hull. But they kept them coming all episode long. It didn't follow physical laws,and thats fine in TV Sci-fi, but it didn't even follow its own internal narrative and thats unforgivably slack.

A student in a creative writing class would get marked down for these literary flaws, and Moffat should be ashamed he let this go to air. And that is coming from someone who's watched and enjoyed his work.

I actually understand the Doctor's reason for doing it and why he felt he was making the best decision, but I still disagree with the way he went about it. 

In a way I see this episode as a companion piece to Fires of Pompeii and The Beast Below. At Pompeii the Doctor had to make the decision to sacrifice the city for the sake of humanity. Who was there for him to help him through it, to help him make the responsible choice as well as show a small act of mercy for one particular family in the end? Donna, his companion. In The Beast Below, he had to make the choice to let the humans keep the space whale enslaved or force them to let it go. Who took that decision out of his hands for him? Amy, his companion.

In each instance it was the companion who helped determine the correct course of action, so I can see why he would feel that fate of humanity would be better off if he just had faith in his companion to make the correct choice, and why he would feel that he was actually respecting them enough to let them do so.

What he failed to take into account was that his companions were there to help make those decisions because they are his friends, and friends don't leave friends to make those kinds of decisions on their own. When he needed them, they were there to help him. Clara isn't upset that she had to make that decision (we know she's perfectly happy to make important decisions on behalf of the Doctor regardless of the Doctor's thought on the matter), but what upset her is that the person she thought was her friend just abandoned her when she needed him.",0,1412534237,null,0,1412551230,0,cl16clj,t3_2id5wx,t1_cl16clj,t1_cl15sd1,null,1426671646,11,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,11

So this is a non-story because the Â£1.5 billion was allegedly defrauded through the NHS procurement system and not the benefits system. As if it's the administrative method that makes it important, not the amount.

And all major providers have ""links to the big parties"". Because if everyone is doing it, it's a non-story.

For this to be a real story, I have to 'prove it' (even as it is being investigated). 

The fact that there is a history of major fraud across a range of the government's privatisation contracts has no bearing on this because, even though many of the same companies are involved, this is a different side of the business. 

Plus, everyone knows that there is no fraud in government procurement because the companies police each other. No evidence of this ever happening is required because it's something we all know to be true. Even though the complains all ""have links to the big parties"", there is zero chance of any collusion.

The Good

* So much attacking intent in the side currently. This is the best side i've seen since my family got season tickets (2007ish). Sakho and Valencia just look like they belong together. Also defensively, they were both running 40 yards back to win possesion. 

* Fullbacks: We all kow Cresswell can play (hopefully wil be a claret for a long time) but Jenkinson was impressive today. They are both adding heaps to our game with opening spaces and being good on the ball. I for one would pay 6-8 million for Jenko if it continues like this.

* Tomkins outshone Reid, and thats not even including his impressive assist for Sakho. Really dominent performance. might be getting back to pre-London Olympics form. 

* Downing/Amilifano: I don't know why Allardyici decided to put both the wingers in central midfield but what a decision. Both were impressive today in all around passing and opening space.  

The Bad

* Alex Song is rusty as hell. Gave away the ball countless. Somehow was given MOTM by the carlsberg people at the game. I'm going to say they were in the Corp Box getting drunk, didn't watch the game, and gave MOTM to the biggest 'name' on the pitch. 

*  The Referee: Had no control on the game. Terrible for both sides. Wasn't giving any fouls which led to constant shirt pulling and shoulders in the back. Krancjar's tackle should have been a Red Card. Disgusting double footed launch at Song. ref was right there and even hesitated in giving the foul... Will be interesting to see if a point is made on Match of the Day. 

* First 10 minutes of the second half: No idea what happened here? if Austin buried that chance from Zamora it could have been a different game. 

All in all was a pretty good day. I for one am pretty positive about this season. COYI

Weekdays (not mon, weds) burger off for the best sit in fast food burgers in Brighton. Also home to the hottest freakin chilli burger in the world. (Google it). 

64 degrees, chef started his own tiny restaurant for daily menu, eat at the pass style dishes. Meat, fish, vegetable, desert. Incredible dining experience, not a stuff your face restaurant. 

BBQ SHACK @ worlds end, the best bbq in the city. No ketchup or mayo served here. Eat your awesome heart attack bbq and love it. Links, ribs, brisket, pulled pork, chicken, ham, sides. Food for dining champions. 


Warung tujuh, balinese street food from legit chefs at decent prices. Not many people go there, book ahead as small amount of covers. 

Dirty Blonde, new as of 2014, generic funky bar restaurant but with chefs that really know what they are fucking doing. I was surprised at the quality of the dishes on offer. 

Pompoko, amazingly FAST chinese/Japanese food served out of a wardrobe sized kitchen at street vendor prices. Bring your own alcohol because they have no serving licence. 

Local fave, but neighbourhood on.st james have great atmosphere, American bar style. and pretty ok fast food for a bar. The garden is decent too.

&gt;

&gt;""__Love &amp; Monsters__"" is the tenth [episode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials) of the [second series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(series_2\)) of the British [science fiction television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_television) series *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*, first broadcast on [BBC One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_One) on 17 June 2006. It was written by executive producer and lead writer [Russell T Davies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_T_Davies) and directed by [Dan Zeff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Zeff).

&gt;The series typically follows alien time traveller [the Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who\)) (in his [tenth incarnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenth_Doctor), played by [David Tennant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Tennant)) and his [companion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion_(Doctor_Who\))(s) (at this time [Rose Tyler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Tyler), played by [Billie Piper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Piper)), who travel around time and space in a machine called the [TARDIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS). However, ""Love &amp; Monsters"" follows a contemporary ordinary man named Elton Pope ([Marc Warren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Warren)) who becomes obsessed with a man called the Doctor and his strange blue box, and joins a group of like-minded people in hopes of finding him. But when the mysterious Victor Kennedy ([Peter Kay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kay)) joins the group, the fun stops and Elton discovers a darker side to his interests. Kennedy ultimately turns out to be a creature called the Abzorbaloff.

&gt;Due to the addition of a [Christmas special](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Christmas_Invasion) in the production schedule, an episode had to be ""double banked"" with another story (in this case ""[The Impossible Planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Impossible_Planet)"" and ""[The Satan Pit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Satan_Pit)"") for production to finish on time. With ""Love &amp; Monsters"", Davies was able to tell a story from a different character's point of view to allow for only a small appearance by Tennant and Piper. The ""Doctor-lite"" and ""companion-lite"" structure has since continued in the programme. The Abzorbaloff was also incorporated into the episode by necessity, as it was the winner of a *[Blue Peter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Peter)* children's competition to design a *Doctor Who* monster. ""Love &amp; Monsters"" was watched by 6.66 million viewers in the United Kingdom and was met with divisive reception by critics and fans. Some praised the complexities of the script, while others felt it was a parody or strayed into offensive humour. Kay and the Abzorbaloff also attracted divided opinions.

As I understand it (only from reading articles about US expats), you're required to file annual returns, even if you're below a threshold where tax is required to be paid to the US as well as your resident country (eg, the UK). Which sounds a bit of a pain, but manageable, until you find out that the cost for doing the admin and filing of these returns can be a couple of thousand dollars (maybe more, maybe less) - according to those I read about.

I suppose it depends on what you value most or what your future intentions are. If you think you might want to live there later on, it might be worthwhile. If there are social security benefits later in life, that might be worth considering (I honestly don't know if that's the case).

On the other hand, if you're just taking occasional trips to Disneyworld, I'd jettison that citizenship straight away.

The article is presented as if there's overwhelming public support for liberalisation of drug policies. Yet the largest figures in support of any such policy - those for Colorado's and Washington's medical marijuana legalisation - are just at about 50%, (and medical use is NOT recreational use!) which isn't anywhere near the 80%ish quoted for saying the war on drugs has failed. So therefore I can only conclude that a large proportion of people saying it's failed actually want tougher sanctions, not weaker ones. Especially since only about 1/3rd of respondents said they would support liberalisation.

You can see that kind of thing in any number of episodes. It's one of Clarkson's ""charms"", it's what he does: make reference to something that the pub-landlord would hold close to his heart.

&gt;Liverpool traditionally is known as having the strongest Irish heritage of any British city, with the possible exception of Glasgow. The Irish have played a major role in Liverpool's population and social fabric for a good part of the city's eight-hundred year history. A lot of Liverpudlians have some Irish ancestry, their Irish ancestors are most likely to have come to Liverpool in the 19th century. The Irish influence is heard in the local Liverpool dialect, often called Scouse, and seen in the faces and names of the populace. At least three of Liverpool's most famous citizens, The Beatles, had some Irish ancestry. George Harrison was of maternal Irish-Catholic derivation. Bandmate Sir Paul McCartney had one Irish grandfather and an Irish great-grandfather. John Lennon's father's family were the descendents of Irish migrants who came to Liverpool in the 19th century. Liverpool's Irish heritage is further highlighted by it being the only English city to have a significant Orange Order membership.

The City has such a strong Irish influence that many Everton fans are Irish aswell, obviously not in as big numbers as Liverpool due to the size of the clubs fanbases. Everton fans often say Liverpool fans are all foreign etc but I doubt they include Irish fans in this category- Its more aimed at Scandinavian fans. Not too sure on Mainland European fans or other clubs but due to being part-Irish and growing up in Liverpool I know a little on the topic, feel free to ask any more questions though :)",0,1412539242,null,0,false,0,cl18ybq,t3_2idpdu,t1_cl18ybq,t1_cl18p1k,null,1426670361,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

Fair enough there has been a lot of coming and going since the last relegation but the last time I felt positive about Harry was in the wake of the Onyewu signing (who we ended up never using). I thought he was building an interesting squad within a budget set by our owners.

Then from that first loss at Burnley onwards it just looked like it wasn't coming together. We could defend well enough, but the squad looked clueless going on the attack. Our post-xmas form was mediocre, and if it wasn't for the points from that 10 game undefeated streak I don't think we would've even made top 6. Every game he wheeled out a different squad. The ponderous passing around the box never ended. BAE kept his spot long after he should've been benched. Endless injuries raised questions about fitness.

The playoffs are a lottery and our number came up.

A summer later and boom - new cast, same shit. Higher level means we won't get away with it like last season. No instinct, no intensity, shoddy and inconsistent tactics. We've ground out two acceptable performances so far (Hull and Sunderland). Lucky against Stoke. Why the fuck did he sell Simpson? Why was he willing to let go of TraorÃ©, leaving us with Hill as the only LB (as he clearly doesn't like the crunch on Yun's biscuits)? Why did he spend millions building for a 3-5-2, only to drop it a few games into the season? The players don't like it? You're their fucking boss. Make them like it.

In the three windows with us he's found a few of his old boys to bring in, and if still here in January expect more. I don't deny that a lot of players seem to enjoy life under his regime. However I suspect this might be because he simply doesn't hassle them. Everyone loves a boss who isn't always hassling you.

To me this is not an impossible choice. This is not even a difficult choice. There are hundreds of thousands of innocent lives on that planet and most likely result of it's hatching is the destruction of the human race. Clara gave humanity a choice and when it made a decision that didn't suit her, she stole it away. Robbed us of our own volition.To make matters worse Clara's choice was irresponsible... nay it was unfathomably moronic and that fact that the shows rewards her for this and tells it's audience that she was right irritates me on a fundamental level.

She played russian roulette with humanities future because she didn't have the balls to get some blood on her hands.

Somebody somewhere needs to tell the media that *""lol u gona die 2nite bitch""* sent through Twitter isn't an actual **death threat**, not really, not in the way that term makes you imagine.

The same effect happens *positively* too, it's why every other picture of a cat that's uploaded is *""OMG THE CUTEST THING EVER, BEST PICTURE SAW IN MY LIFE, MARRY ME? xoxoxoxox""*.

Similarly if there were flashing yellow signals then this indicates that the driver is going to be taking a diverging route ahead which has a lower line speed than the one he is currently travelling on. Again, he would need to adjust his speed but only to be within the speed limit of the divergent line and not due to a rule about passing yellow signals.

As for passing a red, I am not entirely sure however I would assume that they would treat this as being under caution and be prepared to stop at the next signal.

false,Dardanator,null,null,"Supporting federalism and supporting devo max are not necessarily the same thing. In fact I'd argue they are opposed to eachother. A federal country has two defining characteristics:

* **The powers that each federal subject (state, province, whatever you want to call it) has are written into law and cannot be removed by the federal government without the agreement of the federal subjects.** The opposite of this is a unitary state (what the uk is) where the national government is the sole source of power and can distribute power within the country at will. EG the uk government can suspend any of the devolved administrations or local councils and instate direct governance at will, and has done so on several occasions.

* **Each federal subject has the exact same powers and all are viewed equally by the federal government.** The opposite of this is a confederacy, where some federal subjects have greater or fewer powers than others. Canada, for example, is a confederacy.

The first point isn't really relevant here, it's the second one that matters. The lib dem commitment to federalism doesn't just mean that they support devolution; it means that they want each region of the UK, however it is divided up, to have the same level of autonomy and powers. This is where problems arise with devo max. Currently we have the situation where Scotland and, to a lesser extent, Wales, Nothern Ireland and London have a considerable level of autonomy and the rest of England has none. We have already seen the tension and difficulties arising from this - giving scotland devo max would make the inequality significantly worse.

Now I imagine you probably agree with the idea that all parts of the uk should have the same level of self governance, but that would mean all parts of the uk having devo max and the british government doing absolutely nothing but defence and foreign affairs. First of all, that would be a completely ridiculous arrangement, I cannot think of a single country where the national government does so little (maybe the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a special situation brought about by a bloody and violent ethnic war). In most federal states there are a number of reserved matters that the federal government handles itself alone, not just defence and foreign affairs. In addition there are many more matters that the federal government will have certain level of influence over to set a baseline or uniformity, giving states the remaining power to build upon this baseline as they choose.

Secondly we must address whether devo max is right for the rest of the country. We haven't even had a proper discussion about whether it's right for Scotland. Devo max would already be a radical increase in workload for the Scottish parliament and civil service who have little to no experience in many of the reserved matters so we don't know how well they'd cope, so it might go badly wrong. It would be an even more radical change for the rest of the country that could go even more terribly. That's why devolution is done on a gradual basis, withholding certain powers until the particular devolved body has shown that it is ready for them. Even if we agree now that Scotland gets devo max soon and the rest of the country will get it too, it will be several decades before the rest of the uk reaches that stage, especially parts that don't even have a regional legislature. That would mean that the massive inequality caused by devo max would stand for quite some time - it would eventually shrink and disappear but while it remains it threatens more tension and instability.

I think the bottom line is that if Scotland remains in the United Kingdom, which the majority of voters supported in the referendum, then Scotland cannot simply get whatever it wants. Scotland is part of a greater whole and any decisions affecting Scotland's future within the UK must be considered with respect to their impact on other parts of the UK and the country as a whole.

Also I still cannot believe so many people think ""devolve everything except defence and foreign affairs"" is in any way feasible or realistic. ",0,1412543265,null,0,false,0,cl1b1tx,t3_2icp2j,t1_cl1b1tx,t1_cl153n1,null,1426669382,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I definitely found humor in the irony. :)

&gt; And, even though you may find the pro-life thing the best part, I found it horrible, how it was pushing the belief down the viewer's throat.

Was it really pushing it down the viewer's throat, though?

I think there's a very distinct (though sometimes blurry) line between expressing an opinion and shoving it down someone's throat. Yeah, so the episode had a pro-life theme to it; big deal. Since this is the first time in NuWho that this has been done, I don't see it as shoving anything down anyone's throat. Now, if the theme had been a recurring one, then I would give some credence to the show being pushy.

I think the important thing to remember is that there are two responses one can have to this episode in that context: ""Yes, I agree with your opinion,"" and ""No, I don't agree with your opinion."" But it takes a great deal of maturity to come across someone who has the opposite response that you do and say ""That's cool"" (which, if I recall correctly, is how ""tolerance"" works.

The most common complaint it ""If they want profit then they don't care about the patients"", but I've never seen any actual *evidence* that profit=don't give a fuck about patients.  It's the profit motive which demands that they *do* care about patients, otherwise they'll be selected out of the market by one which does.

Another one is ""look at USA we don't want that"", but USA's healthcare system isn't free market, it's private but with a *huge* amount of state intervention which is directly responsible for the problems the American people have with their system.

It's more like:  Look at the European model, private healthcare but paid for by the state.  Nobody else in Europe has an NHS, and given how much everyone on here looks to the superior continental nations (especially the Nordic countries) for guidance, I can't understand why people are so selective in this instance.

Either way, I just don't see the problem with profit.  People will say ""but you can't pick when you are in a car accident and taken to a hospital so the free market fails"", whilst this is true at first glance, there could be some sort of predetermined preference known to you and others.

false,bairy,null,null,"&gt; What speed limits apply and so forth when proceeding past a single amber aspect

I don't believe there are any set limits aside from line speed or points speed. How fast the train -should- be going depends on many things:  
how far to the next signal,  
how viewable the next signal is. i.e. if it's around a bend without a repeater then a slower approach is needed,  
how powerful the braking is, with light engines needing more time than an EMU,  
the gradients,  
rail conditions, ice would need more time for example

However some signals have a pair of TPWS loops before the signal to make sure the train is going slow enough, these will have a set speed which the driver will know.

&gt; I would also like to know how a train is supposed to proceed after being given permission to pass a signal at danger

To the best of my knowledge, once the signaller has given permission to pass it should still be treated as ""danger"" (which is what a red means) and that there is something on the block ahead. Usually pass at danger will be so a train can come up behind another unit in the station, perhaps for coupling.

I -believe- that if the two white lights are on, the TPWS won't stop the train, however TPWS can be disabled in the driver's cab for 60 seconds to pass over, once given permission to of course.

After that it's just a case of driving appropriate. Going round a corner? Go slower. Coming up on another unit? break early and stop short.

This idea that only flags on ships can be called the ""Union Jack""  appears to be a fairly modern concept.  The flag has been referred to as the Union Jack in all sorts of contexts for many many years.  The Admiralty themselves don't even restrict the ""jack"" term to mean only flags on ships.

[Seeing as the Monarchy are perfectly happy](http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Symbols/UnionJack.aspx) with us plebs calling it the Union Jack, I think I'll pass on the pedantry.

&gt; The term 'Union Jack' possibly dates from Queen Anne's time (r. 1702-14), but its origin is uncertain. 

&gt; It may come from the 'jack-et' of the English or Scottish soldiers, or from the name of James I who originated the first union in 1603.

Before that the promise was, to my knowledge, Scotland would be given some more powers (not to the same extent said in the last two weeks) with a reduced/revised Barnett formula.

Can you see why this revised promise might cause some disagreement in England? While I agree Scotland should get the powers it was promise, they can't be given until other more pressing questions have been answered (ie. the West Lothian/English Question and the Barnett problem). If they don't get answered resentment will develop between Scotland and England/rUK. The no vote should have been for a Federal UK, we would have had two years of pan UK debates instead of what is happening now.

As mentioned above what was promised was new and so the time-scale arguable does not apply any more.

I feel that sometimes in the media the South East is portrayed as an out of touch haven for the rich, and that that is the cause of the support for UKIP here. But in my experience it's mostly the poor that support them, and we certainly have our poor. 

Where the Conservatives tell the young, uneducated and unemployed that the reason they haven't got a job is because they're lazy and feckless, UKIP tells them it's not their fault, but the EU's. Who would you listen to of those two? And those two are our only options around here, as the majority of the elderly will vote Conservative until the sun burns out. 

There are barely any immigrants to see around here (4% the article mentions, but I'm willing to bet it's much lower even that that here) but UKIP has managed to convince people that if they don't leave the EU, the problems we face now will multiply as a tidal wave of immigrants are just over the horizon, never mind if there are only a few now. Never mind that UKIP's social policies are much the same as the Conservative ones that they're rejecting in the first place.

false,Lord_Monboddo,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"You raise a lot of good points, have an upvote. Posts like yours are more the type I'd like to see on reddit if we're to have good debates. I wouldn't argue with all of the substance of this, although just a few points. It first of all it isn't true that all federations have equally powerful legislatures, there are asymmetric federations where some states have varying levels of power. There is nothing particularly set in stone about this, it seems to be by degrees of autonomy. Belgium has moved from being a unitary state to a federal one and now appears to be moving towards confederation.

I would also ask is it truly unequal for Scotland to be more autonomous until such time as England and others decide what future they envision for themselves? Scotland is a country of 5 million whilst England is a country of 53 million, we are not equal parts by numbers. Also historical context is important, Scotland is the most independence minded of the UK's countries and the cost of maintaining it in the Union may be allowing it a greater level of autonomy (such as was the case with Quebec). After all was it unequal that Northern Ireland had autonomy long before Scotland did as a result of historical considerations (although lost it briefly due to Direct Rule)? I would want England to have greater autonomy, in fact as much autonomy as Scotland if at all possible but we have no idea what that would mean (is it feasible to have one English parliament or do we need several) or if the English want it. I would imagine it'd need a referendum or referendums.

I think your point about competency is a fair one although I would argue with you that this is why devolution has been gradual. It has been gradual because of political consideration, devolution of greater powers has coincided with the increase in support for the SNP and the subsequent referendum. The UK government passed extra powers to try and curb support for independence but without ceding too many powers. You may with hindsight argue that was a good idea from the view of governance but it was not the reason extra powers were devolved the way they were. The UK government didn't think ahead about this but instead reacted to the political situation as it evolved. Also theoretically you could have a scenario whereby you set up timetable where powers are given to the Scottish parliament in stages towards the *ideal* whatever that is, to overcome the issue of competency. Rather than just giving some powers now on the promise of more down the line.

I would say this is a general problem I have with the points you've raised which is political theory is all well and good but what about political reality? I await Lib Dems idea of federalism but I am highly sceptical of the Lib Dems generally, they are as cynical as the other parties (for example their whole Shetlands and Orkney point during the referendum was an outrageous one put forward just to stir the pot). The point here really is, who would deliver federalism (the Lib Dems definitely can't)? How can it be delivered and how will parliamentary support be raised (I can't see Labour and Tories agreeing)? Will it appease Scottish and English (as well as Welsh and Northern Irish) demands? Will we have a constitution at long last? The UK government has never delivered across the board reform like this before, can it now? A problem the UK has is that a common sentiment is that Scotland asks and then it must wait, this was particularly engendered due to the 1979 referendum. There is also a historical point to be raised here that this was the exact same problem for Ireland, one of the reasons Irish independence became a political reality was the slow progress made by the British government over Irish Home Rule (despite the IPP making consistent demands for it). It is fair to say that the UK has been slower than most at political reform and still has a long way to go, localism has been a running sore as well and time and again neither Labour nor Tories have tackled it.

Perhaps it is unfair to say everything but defence and foreign affairs should be devolved however the Unionists are therefore as much as fault as the Nationalists for putting in the minds of the electorate the idea of maximum possible devolution. If we had heard more of the sort of points you had raised it might be different but they never really challenged devo-max, they just pushed it off the ballot. Although what devo-max is has never really been figured out either, it could count as the maximum *possible* devolution without being almost totally autonomous. The politicians now must get it right and I question their ability to do so, we need genuine considered reform of the type the UK has never gone in for before. They've opened a pandora's box here.

false,stzp,null,null,"&gt; I've never seen any actual evidence that profit=don't give a fuck about patients

You aren't providing any evidence for any of your assertions either.  What evidence is there that a profit motive makes healthcare providers care more about patients, or that the US healthcare system's problems are caused by too much state intervention?  All of these questions are so broad and complex that it's difficult to obtain any evidence.

&gt;  Look at the European model, private healthcare but paid for by the state.

That's hugely oversimplified.  For example, in France, apparently [62% of hospital capacity is publically run and only 18% is for-profit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_France).  Even in the US, [only 18% of hospitals are for-profit](http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d05743t.pdf) - the majority are run by nonprofit organisations and a significant minority are run by the government.

&gt; Either way, I just don't see the problem with profit.

The obvious arguments are that the profits could have been spent on something useful, and that the competing hospitals will waste money on duplication of effort and marketing.  I'm not saying those problems necessarily outweigh the benefits you argued for, but they definitely exist.

&gt; When it comes to ""I need to have this operation at some point in the future"", you genuinely can just select the best deal

How am I supposed to evaluate which surgeons and facilities are the best, and perhaps even choose between different possible procedures, especially if I am seriously ill?  If you add in emergency procedures and ones that are rare enough to only be offered by a small number of hospitals, it's pretty clear that this is never going to be a very efficient market.

&gt; we can't just keep increasing the budget forever and still see no improvements

false,Dardanator,null,null,"What is devo max defined as? From this thread it seems to be ""everything except foreign affairs and defence"". I can understand why people who wanted independence would support it, they'd be happy to use it as a stepping stone toward independence and if it leads to a situation where Scotland's position in the uk is unsustainable then so much the better for them. However, Scotland remaining in the uk for the long term with that level of power does not make sense to me.

[Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_and_excepted_matters) is a list of reserved matters for Scotland (ie, things not devolved). There are arguments for a number of those being devolved, but every single one except defence and foreign affairs? Why would the British government agree to devolve powers to legalise drugs and firearms, for example, and why would Scotland benefit from them? Or matters pertaining to critical national infrastructure? Why do you want the Scottish government to have full control over welfare when you have no idea how well it will cope, instead of starting by devolving some powers and seeing whether it's sensible to continue? Why would Scotland need the power to create its own currency, or absolute control over broadcasting?

Then there's the question of what Scotland should contribute to the UK, with one of the themes of devo max being that Scotland should keep all the money it raises. Some in this thread have said it should pay toward communal resources like the armed forces - how do you decide what Scotland should pay? What if Scotland runs into financial difficulties and this cost is more than it can afford? In that circumstance it would be fair to ask Scotland to pay only what it can afford to, but this cannot come without the opposite case of asking Scotland to contribute more than it's fair share if it's a wealthier than average part of the UK. If Scotland is struggling and needs investment, should the UK provide it or say that Scotland must raise the money itself? Again it is fair that the wealthier parts of the country should subsidise poorer parts. It is unrealistic that Scotland would remain in the UK and keep all of the money it raises and only pay toward defence and foreign affairs, which is what devo max implies. That could lead to the situation where Scotland is significantly more wealthy than the rest of the country, worsening inequality. It could also lead to the situation where Scotland is struggling more than the rest of the country but has removed its right to ask for funding from the rest of the UK to help out because it hasn't been giving anything up to that point. It is far more likely that a certain proportion of money would be paid to the Scottish treasury, and another large proportion would go to the UK treasury which would distribute it around the UK where investment is needed, even if that means sending it back to Scotland.

Devo max is not the simple minor increase in powers you are making it out to be, it would significantly alter Scotland's relationship with the rest of the UK (becoming more like a crown dependency of the UK rather than a part of it). It would involve a substantial increase in workload and responsibility for the scottish parliament and civil service, which has absolutely no experience in many of the reserved areas that would be devolved under devo max. More importantly it's something that hasn't been debated very much, nor has a consistent definition been agreed upon. Why, then, does it shock you that some Scottish people may not want to go for this on a whim?

false,jerboa256,null,null,"First off, while space is not empty, it is a much more empty vacuum than anything ever produced on earth. There are a few atoms per cubic meter. At that density, wings don't work. The protons, photons and other things have much less mass than air and are much less dense in space than air on Earth. Even at Earth air density, I doubt it would be sufficient to propel a creature the size of the moon. Dark matter is a huge portion of the mass of the universe, but only on the galactic scale. It is everywhere, but not very dense. If it were dense, we would have measured it by now.

Solar sails are potentially viable for certain types of voyages, but that is mostly because they don't need to carry fuel, and because of the extremely high vacuum of space, almost no energy is lost to air resistance. However, photons have very little momentum compared with a mass the size of the moon. If we ignored the Earth's gravity well, the creature's wing sails would need to sit still pointed at the sun for a very long time to speed up any appreciable amount compared with the size of the solar system. If we assume a photon pressure from the Wikipedia page on solar sails, a wing area the size of the cross section of the moon, and the mass of the moon, we find an acceleration of just 1e-15 m/s^2. This number goes down as it moves away from the sun, which is the only direction solar sails can take you. At this rate, it would be traveling as fast as the Voyager probe (which is slow by interstellar standards, but might be ok for something that takes 100 million years to gestate) in 5e11 years, which is about 40 times the age of the universe. 

TL;DR: Wings don't work in hard vacuum, even if it isn't totally empty, and solar sails would take much longer than the age of the universe to speed a creature that size up to interstellar speeds.",0,1412551654,null,0,false,0,cl1ezsj,t3_2iazo2,t1_cl1ezsj,t1_cl164i3,null,1426667489,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

This is not so different from what we saw with the derelict warehouses around the Cains factory, which has now become the Baltic Triangle, a thriving tech-industry and rather bohemian hub. Also Liverpool One completely changed the river-side of the city. I remember at the time thinking it was taking too long and it was doomed to fail but looking back now it's an incredible improvement.

The boarded up houses are more likely a result of poor centralised government action, the movement of cash over social investment and many other big issues which have very little to do with football. I also know that regenerating this area is one of the top priorities of the council but budget cuts and working with private industry like LFC can sometimes slow things down.

There is a difference between cultural appreciation and cultural appropriation.

Appropriation ultimately fetishizes and exotifies things that are 'foreign'. Tribals and foreign characters (especially Hanzi/Kanji) demonstrate this quite well.

In all honesty, it doesn't seem as big of blight as it could be, seeing as how they slowly bought the houses with the real intention of building a new stadium (even if it is 15 years later).  It doesn't seem like they were intentionally destroying the neighborhood as much as it seems like a very poorly planned operation while under management.

false,AnselaJonla,null,null,"&gt; what are the chances of high infection in a society with good sanitation and healthcare?

I guess we should be watching Dallas closely for a bit, given that an Ebola patient turned up there.

My gut feeling is that it *shouldn't* spread so easily in north-west Europe. Ebola is spread through contact with the bodily fluids of an infectious person. It is *not* airborne. As long as people are conscientious about their own personal hygiene, it shouldn't gain much of a foothold here.

Our burial practices give us an advantage over the parts of Africa where this outbreak started. We do not prepare our own dead for burial, washing and redressing the body by hand with no protective gear. Such things are done by professionals.

As for the healthcare aspect? We have, what, two isolation beds in the whole of the country? Doctors and nurses will need to follow strict barrier nursing methods, like a vet in a kennel full of parvo-puppies. Maybe the victims could be sent to one or two strategically located hospitals (London, Birmingham and Glasgow, for example), which would be dedicated solely to such patients.

Personally, I'm going to continue carrying around a bottle of hand sanitiser, and I'm going to use it more often. Such as after every time I am handed money. I would, personally, suggest that such a thing becomes mandatory for cashiers. So many of them have hand sanitiser at the till, but they never use it.

**This episode is both pro-choice and anti-abortion.** It's fair for both sides. The doctor left human beings to make the choice-- and even three women. One voted to abort (and the ""rest"" of humanity) while the other two didn't. Sure, things turned out OK from letting the thing be born, but things might have also been OK from killing the thing.. it doesn't matter in the end, just that it was their choice. 

People forget too easily that it is possible to be both against abortion, and at the same time, respect that other people have the right to make the choice.

First, I will agree with you, they need to do more with the tardis. For example sometimes he is able to fly the Tardis like the best pilot ever other times he is baffled by it. I believe that yes they were going to the moon but I do not believe that it was his intent to go to the moon in the year 2049.  if you have some point in the show that contradicts me I will yield on your point.

The reason why in my opinion he is hurt is because he genuinely thought that he was doing a good thing. Courtney becomes the president United States this was a girl who thought she wasn't special.  Which at the beginning of the episode both Courtney and Clara rightfully were upset at him for minimizing Courtney.

Ultimately, Clara is upset because she was scared and felt abandoned.  Considering the fact that her boyfriend is muttering crap in her ear every two seconds about the Doctor I find her point a bit weak.  Still there is validity in how she feels but attributing sinister motives to the Doctor is a bit much.

&gt;Seems silly to choose a new MP for only 6 months

Indeed, but people need representation, no matter how short a time period. 

Bear in mind that by-elections happen often and the rule is always the same no matter whether there are 4 years until the next GE or 4 months. There are MP's who won theirs in 2011, 2012, 2013 and have been sitting comfortably in their seat for a couple of years.. It just happens to be the future MP for those two seats' bad luck that it's now so close to a GE that they won't have much time to get comfy before needing to campaign for re-election.

false,MisterBTS,sontaran,Sontaran,"Well, having just read some of the 'official' discussion thread about the episode, I do agree with many of the comments there complaining about the poor 'science' of the episode (except that I am quite willing to give them a pass about the gravity thing - that's just a classic Doctor Who contrivance to save money so the actors wouldn't have to be bouncing up and down on like real moon-walkers for the whole episode).

However, ignoring that factor, I did like this episode more than The Caretaker for one reason: the conflict -between the characters-, that is so often missing in Doctor Who, seemed more genuine here than in the last episode.

Clara is pissed, and I would say rightly so.  She isn't sure how much of the Doctor's 'grey area' claims are real, or whether the Doctor knew exactly what was going to happen all along.  Perhaps the Doctor is just playing God and treating the humans like playthings.  She's not sure.  It will be interesting to see how long the Doctor travels without Clara (it looked to me like she's not in the next episode), and how they will get back together.

On the other hand, the previous episode seemed contrived in terms of the conflicts.  We've got the Doctor 'hating soldiers' again, and still no clear reason why.  We've got him mistaking another random bloke for Clara's boyfriend, which seems unlikely to me since the Doctor is 2-effing-thousand years old at this point and has experienced quite a lot in terms of relationships.  Pink's reaction to the Doctor seemed over the top as well.  I wouldn't expect them to be best buddies right off the bat, but he really seemed to recoil at the Doctor's demeanor as an authority figure.  Maybe that will make more sense when we learn more about the bad experiences in Danny's past as a soldier.",0,1412558618,null,0,false,0,cl1i43n,t3_2ic2kk,t1_cl1i43n,t3_2ic2kk,null,1426666034,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

I would respond that communities have an interest in seeing investments in their citizens pay dividends. If you're hooked on hard drugs that won't happen. And while other potentially addictive substances/pasttimes can be consumed in moderation, heroin and coke lend themselves to serious addictions.

I'll note that I think cigarettes should also be illegal, but just for health reasons. And I don't have a problem with alcohol because nearly everyone I know, successful or not, drinks at least occasionally. It's possible to consume alcohol in a healthy manner, and it's not so incredibly addictive that it's *rare* to consume it in a healthy manner, unlike the other drugs I mentioned.

And I know I rationalized it from an economic/utilitarian perspective earlier, but my real reason is more human/emotional: no one should be enslaved by addictive drugs. It's horrifying.

I don't know about that. Remember the most important question the Doctor has asked this season. Is he a Good Man? 

We know that he could make a good Dalek. But, he hates the Daleks with every fiber of his being. So, it would follow that he sees his worst enemy in his own eyes. He hates the very thought of being anything like the Daleks.

So, he is out to prove that he can be a Good Man. He ""saved"" a unique species and taught humanity something in the process. Isn't that objectively good? 

But, his methods ended up hurting someone he cared for. He caused Clara harm. 

Clara was in a situation where she accepted her imminent death. It was only when she reached out to stop that the Doctor arrived.

But, I feel Clara only reached out to the button in panic. She didn't want to die. She was flailing for any way out. She was scared and so very afraid. It doesn't surprise me that it broke her. 

He had a damn decent idea to be a Good Man, but his execution was awful. He got cocky. He got sloppy. And he hurt Clara.

**Moon is gaining mass!**

From what? How? This was never explained. Even if it was a giant space chicken the mass still needs to come from somewhere it doesn't just materialize out of nowhere.

**Gravity on the moon randomly turns off**

This was also never explained. There is literally no reason this should have happened.

**Germs who apparently are the size of small dogs**

While you can find very large cells they are not complex enough to act like a wild animal (that requires a brain which cells do not have) nor do they have teeth or walk around. A giant bacteria would just be a big blob not a glowing spider thing.

**We can't let the moon be destroyed by the hatching of a space chicken so let's instead blow the moon up with a shitload of nuclear bombs!**

This also completely ignores the fact that killing the creature doesn't solve the problem they came up there to fix in the first place (the moon being too heavy)

**Mexicans have a mining operation on the moon but for some reason no space ships exist and it takes them 10 years to get back up to the moon**

How did they get on the moon then? What the fuck writers...

With each passing episode, I'm liking Capaldi as the Doctor less and less.

I think he could be amazing with different writers. He was incredible in Children of Earth, which made me happily look forward to his debut as the Doctor, only to end up being the most disappointed with a debut since Colin Baker's. 

After enduring 7 (6) episodes of Capaldi desperately grinding through scripts wholly unsuited to him, I actually find myself hoping that he regenerates after 4 more episodes so the writers can find someone better suited to them, because it's a very safe bet that the writers aren't going anywhere anytime soon.

There was only one episode that properly utilized Capaldi's talents, and that one was ""Listen"". Best episode since ""Blink"", hands down. Even Moffat's [as of late] broken clock can be right twice a day. Sadly, it's missed a lot of days since Capaldi started.

If they insist on making Capaldi into a bitchy ""Doctor Malcolm"", the least they could do is have him tell Clara to go f*ck herself with a crowbar sideways twice when she has one of her little snits.

Where they either incorrectly reveal geographical information about a user or a way to somehow control the order of who you see. Otherwise you're memorising faces of the members of staff and the endlessly shuffling through pictures (as you have no means of controlling order in either app) until you spot someone who looks correct. That would take fucking ages. I guess with some facial recognition software you might be able to automate it but its tricky to rely on the quality and angle of photo on something like tindr/grindr for your algorithm to work.  

If you want to breach that security then I think it'd be _much_ easier to specifically target the staff on their off days and ""accidentally"" bump into them to start a relationship. Idk, maybe they're already trained against that?  
I think the simplest vector is still social engineering the doorman himself or maybe just breaking in by directly attacking their security system (reverse engineering the software from the vendor or deactivating it in another fashion).  
I mean if you're really going to go to all that effort then social engineering via the families of people working there is going to be more reliable (befriend their mother/sister/brother etc so its looks less suspect).  

Its all about whether you have the resources to easily write the software or not. If you don't then you're basically making a leap of faith in whether it would work. If you go the social engineering route you're putting in less effort (in both cases you'll need an agent to be on the ground but with just social engineering you don't need the software) and the chances of success are the same or higher. I guess it really does just depend on whether or not their staff are trained to treat ""accidental"" meetings as suspicious or not.  
What might be easier than all of this is just tapping the comms wires, intercepting calls to outside vendors and then taking one of them and not forwarding it and sending your own agent in to do maintenance or deliver something or w/e.

Sterling is at his best when played centrally and can use his pace to move through the channels of the opposition's defense. Both Balotelli and Sturridge have the ability to hold up the ball and bring in Sterling, Henderson, or Lallana into the final third.

Playmakers still need someone to pass to, he's clearly not able to ""make plays"" without players like Ronaldo, Di Maria, etc.

&gt;To play a 40 yard curving throughball and land it right into the path of an on rushing Ronaldo takes absolute skill. 

Fabregas literally *casually* did this today. It's not a unique skill to Ozil.

&gt;The only thing that Ronaldo did was help finish the plays off after the pass was played..

False, Ronaldo doesn't make the run/make himself available, there is no pass to be played, no person to pass to.


&gt;I don't get why you think the passes where any less amazing because of this.

Because he clearly cannot replicate those performances playing with worse players.

&gt;ability and vision in world football, 

When playing with other world class players.


&gt;obviously the quality of the forwards will change how much of these passes get converted but it does nothing to reduce the quality of them. 

He's not even *making* passes anywhere near the level he did at Madrid. He's been *dreadful* since the second half of last season.

&gt;You are basing your evaluation of Ozil off of what? One game and half a season if not less? Where he was being played out of position no less? This is fucking ridiculous, this is the logic of a child.

Nope, I'm basing it on the fact that since the second half of last season Ozil has been absolute trash. It's been almost a full calender year and he's been awful. It's pretty obvious that Ozil needs a world class DM, world class wingers, and world class forwards to look like a quality player. World class players don't look world class wherever they play. This just seems like the same bullshit spouted with Torres ""Well he just needs someone to create better chances for him, then he'll be world class again!"" Wrong.

I don't. I was putting up with her shit because I thought she had a *lot* of potential.

I *loved* her character in Asylum. Absolutely *loved* it. She was tragic, she was *brilliant,* and she was so well written.

Then she became this absolute mystery. Who the hell is this girl? This girl that pops in and out of the Doctor's own timeline... Who can die in so many places and yet is still there to save him once more?

Then the mystery was solved. We saw how that happened, what force wove her directly into the timeline of the Doctor. All that was left was a tragic and brilliant person...

But with this episode, I don't really know anymore...  
I want Moffatt to bring the mystery back, or to make her more interesting again. I don't know... she seems way too... cocky. She doesn't seem like a foil to the Doctor anymore, and she *really* doesn't seem like an audience stand in. Her ""deus-ex machina"" style plot device is, pretty much, played through. Probably a good thing she's leaving at the end of the season, as much as I *did* like both her character and Coleman's acting.

&gt;The __trolley problem__ is a [thought experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment) in [ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics), first introduced by [Philippa Foot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippa_Foot) in 1967,  but also extensively analysed by [Judith Jarvis Thomson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Jarvis_Thomson),   [Peter Unger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Unger),  and [Frances Kamm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Kamm) as recently as 1996.  Outside of the domain of traditional philosophical discussion, the trolley problem has been a significant feature in the fields of [cognitive science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science) and, more recently, of [neuroethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroethics). It has also been a topic on various TV shows dealing with human psychology. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]

They also fit the 'embodiment of war propaganda and xenophobia' description quite nicely, so I assumed that's what /u/nazishark meant.

The Master kinda-sorta redeemed himself at the end of his last story arc (or at least, his motives are more understandable now) - last we saw of him, he appeared to be seeking revenge on the Time Lord leadership for manipulating him and voluntarily locking himself behind the Time Lock in the process. Not 'good', perhaps - he's presumably planning acts of violence, for a less-than-noble reason, but revenge against someone even worse makes him a lot more ethically palatable than when he was trying to dominate and enslave the universe. I would argue that he was never really portrayed as 'pure evil' to the extent the Daleks have been, though; I got more of the sense that he was an unhinged megalomaniac, perhaps a glimpse of what The Doctor could  become if he had a psychotic break one day. I got a sort of Joker-ish vibe from his character. A bad guy, to be sure, but at least a tiny bit sympathetic.

The Cybermen have never struck me as nearly as grave a threat to The Doctor or the universe as a whole as the Daleks, and their motives seem a good bit less 'evil' (they want to 'upgrade' all compatible life forms to join their ranks, while the Daleks just want to kill everything that isn't a Dalek out of sheer hate).

Exactly, which makes it hard for playmakers to thrive when they don't have quality players ahead of them. You are helping prove my point.

false,jfredett,tardis,TARDIS,"I'm no physicist, but I am a mathematician. *Prepares his calculator*

To the math!

The relevant equation is:

F = G * m1 * m2 / r^2

The radius of the moon is `1750km`, the mass of the earth is about `5.9e24 kg`, the mass of the moon is about `7.3e22 kg`, and the distance between the earth and the moon is about `3.6e8 m`. If we assume the creature cannot shift it's CoM outside of the shell (doing so would break the shell, and it doesn't do that till the end of the episode. So the question is how much change in force is there to be gained (or lost) by moving the moon ~1750km closer to the earth.

**tl;dr** not much.

Long answer:

Plugging in the numbers, the current gravity exerted on the earth by the moon is:

    G * 5.9e24 * 7.3e22 / 3.6e8^2 ~ 2.22e20 N

Where `N` is the `newton`, a unit of force. Lifting up a gallon of water one meter in one second requires about `2N` of force (give or take).

Moving the moon closer, it would exert a whopping:

    G * 5.9e24 * 7.3e22 / (3.6e8 - 1.75e6)^2 ~ 2.24e20 N

or about `2e18N` more force, enough to pull `~1e18` extra gallons of water one meter in one second, or about a billion gallons of water for every man, woman, and child on planet earth. That's a lot, or so it sounds, but the devil is in the details. The reality is the difference in gravity applied to the whole of the ocean is only `2.24/2.22 ~ 1.009` times as much force. I don't know too much about tides, but I suspect that the increase of gravity is linearly proportional to the increase in tide, that'd mean that a tide of about `1m` would increase by about `1cm`. Not even enough to notice, really.

--------------------------------------

For fun, let's see what happens when you get really close, enough to make a `1m` tide into a mini-tsunami. Tsunami's have been recorded to have wave heights in the 'tens of meters' according to wikipedia, so Let's aim for a 5-fold increase in force. To do that, we just solve:

     (G*m1*m2 / (r-x)^2) / (G*m1*m2 / r^2) = 5

`r = 3.6e8` (the others will get canceled out after a bit of algebra) to get:

    2.0e8

That'd put the moon at a comfy 1.6m from the earth. For the record, I'm `2m` tall. I guess I'd have to duck.

Also, if the moon were that close, we'd probably have some bigger problems. Still, what about an increase in tide height of `2.5`? That's likely to cause some nasty problems for folks on the coast at least, right? That'd mean if you had a `2m` tide to start with, you'd have a `5m` tide, goodbye sandy beaches!

Well, that'd require the moon to be moved `1.3e8` meters closer, again with the ducking, I suppose.

This is the interesting bit about quadratic decay, it doesn't take much to half the power. That's about 70cm change there. Let's try just a 1.5-times increase, from 2m to 3m, that'll flood some basements, probably, if you live on the coast. Definitely would screw with the climate, too, I bet. `6.6e7` meters, that leaves about `2.4m` of space to stand. 

Not to mention the whole igniting the atmosphere problem would probably evaporate the oceans make the whole problem moot.

In fact, pretty much any meaningful change in tides would cause much greater destruction that the tides would be the least of our trouble. In order for tides to become a problem without changing the CoM, the moon would *have* to gain mass, and that would *have* to come from outside, and we'd notice.

I won't even get started on the whole 'it's only eggshell' bit. Suffice that those 'eggshells' are still probably kilometers-wide chunks of rock that'll be hurtling in the general direction of the earth. Giving us a few million 'Armageddon'-style events to deal with. Better tell Bruce Willis to get his spacesuit out.

I'm saying that those specific problems can be solved by the police actually removing those people and arresting the ones who break the law. Open air dealing doesn't mean the whole war on drugs has failed - it simply means that the enforcement is not good enough.

Near to Stamford Bridge is the Natural History Museum which you must do, it's breathtaking. Next to that is the Victoria &amp; Albert museum (V&amp;A).

&gt;If you actually watched him carefully you could clearly see that he is still making quality passes.

Not often.

&gt;Fabregas didn't ""casually"" do it

Your propensity to nit pick shows that you're argument isn't great.

&gt;Exactly, which makes it hard for playmakers to thrive when they don't have quality players ahead of them. You are helping prove my point.

No, you don't understand, people who are ""world class"" especially in the PLAY MAKING category create plays no matter who is around them. Creating chances happens whether a goal is scored or not. Ozil has not been a world class play maker at Arsenal. He was 6th last season in chances created in the EPL, that's good, but that's not ""world class"" for a play maker. The point about Ronaldo is that Ronaldo can make anyone look better than they really are. Shit, he almost dragged an absolutely awful Portugal team out of the group stages.

&gt;Again, all you have been doing is judging your entire view of a player off of half a season, so short sighted...  

No, I'm judging him on his time not playing with Ronaldo. He just has not been as good since he's come to the PL.


&gt;What the hell are you even saying?

That if he was truly world class, he would still look world class at Arsenal. But he doesn't, he only did at Real Madrid.

&gt;And the fact that you are trying to force a comparison with Torres is unbelievably sad. The two are nothing like each other. Torres was a failure at Chelsea. Ozil had more MOTM awards in his first few months with Arsenal than Torres did in the entirety of his Chelsea career. 

Yeah you're not really bright are you? It's a simple comparison about fans justifying poor performances. 

&gt;Thank god people like you are not in charge of transfers. Otherwise we would have never bought Cesc Fabregas who was very poor for Barcelona the entire second half of last season

Damn, you're actually dumb. Despite being ""very poor"" for half a season Fabregas was still very good over his collective time at Barcelona. Ozil has not been good over his collective time at Arsenal. 

&gt;had a bad world cup

Literally every spanish player had a bad world cup, I don't think anyone is judging him by that. 

&gt;Mourinho and Chelsea understood that playing bad for a little bit doesn't suddenly make you a shit player.

Again proving you're not very smart because you can't really understand what I'm saying. Ozil *has not been great* for Arsenal, that's not really up for debate. My point is not that he *is* shit, but that his time at Arsenal is proving that the players around him at Real Madrid made him look better than he really is. He's not bad, I think he's quite good actually since you don't get 6th in chances created if you're bad, but he's clearly not the best play maker in the world and was quite overrated at Madrid from playing with one of the best assembled squads in the world. Ozil is a good player, at one point he was great. But I don't think he was ever the best play maker in the world.

---------------------------

The Quran.

Really.  Everybody on the fence about Islam should read that book.  If you want a taste, may I suggest browsing through the ['Skeptic's annotated Quran'](http://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/quran/).  

The Quran's the only book I know where I am accused of being bigoted against its ideology for actually quoting verbatim its contents.  So people should read it for themselves.

Edit:  [Here's the page on 'Cruelty in the Quran'](http://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/quran/cruelty/long.html)  You tell me if these views are closest to Henning or ISIS.

-----------------------

OK, what's the source for saying that 100X greater number of people sympathize, than have run off to the ME?

I guess it's just based on the highly credible idea that only a small percentage of people who agree with ISIS would take the next step of actually going to join them.

Dirty Blonde is 100% a dinner place (it's actually a bar/club at night) AND I would also 100% suggest that at DB you don't get mains but get a whole bunch of starters to share because they are definitely their strength. Their mains are great too, just not as different? You'll understand when you're there!

La Choza can be both - it's always really busy though, so if you're more than maybe two people, be prepared to go in, leave a name and number, and they'll call you when they have one (they don't do reservations since they're always so crowded). It's always a very ""Brightony"" place, so it's my go-to place for taking guests who come to visit for just the day or so. Gives a good textbook experience of it.

Ideya (sp?) is a lunch/brunch/breakfast place and really surprised me - as someone who has never really been exposed to vegetarian cuisine before moving to Brighton, I was blown away. It's also won a bunch of awards I know, and for a bloody good reason too. 

I've only been to Pompoko once, and I got a quick takeaway that I rushed to eat on a park bench - doesn't give you a very reliable experience but it was really very good, and it's always spoken very highly of by us students because it doesn't cost as much as you'd think!

The name of the place on the beach that serves the amazing burgers - there's a sign in front saying it's the 3rd best in the UK - sadly escapes me but I know it's on the bit of seafront between West Street and East Street if that helps on google maps. If it's a nice day, that bit makes a nice stroll anyway! 

And to finally add my own that I didn't see here: Sabai, a Thai place which is weirdly well hidden for a place that is on what is technically the high street. If you like spicy food, this is your dream - I'm personally awful at spicy, even if I'm working on it because I wish I wasn't, but when there with friends I will persevere to still try some of their curries because they are just so milky and silky and beautiful.

To be fair, there's equally hateful bollocks in the Bible, but Christianity has long been in decline in Britain and without a significant reversal will never again threaten secular liberalism. Can we say the same of Islam, which is retarding the development of liberal democracy in the Middle East and attacking freedom across Europe when it gets the chance?

If there are connections between politicians and public service providers there should be a proper monitoring process of the way the services are run. Otherwise we are replacing the good governance fallacy with a 'free market' ideology fallacy. We cannot ignore these links, to write it off as:

is idiotic. If there is a conflict of interest, that is a serious problem and at this early stage of privitisation (whether you agree or disagree it's happening) we need to design a system that is future proof.

It was observed by another DW redditor that one of the bigger differences between show runners was that Davies focused on the doctor as the one who carries the adventure and the companion as the one who carries the human element and heart. Moffat moved the heart over to the doctor when he started leaving the companions with little more than humor and on good episodes some investment in their well being. 

I will openly say I hated Clara when she came on. Other than the cybermen episode, she didn't have many traits or times when she made a difference and took maters into her own hands. (This was mostly due to the stupid ""who is Clara"" arch). 

Looking at this season she's done a lot more and (in my opinion) we have gotten a better idea of who she is and how she handles situations. The level of interest I have in her activities varies but it is a step up from last season. 

Reading through your comments I have noticed a couple handfuls of issues; however, plot holes aside ( and the fact that some of the things the doctor did some very non doctor things) I kinda liked seeing Clara tackle something large mostly on her own.

The episode  basically threw physics completely out the window. While this is normally forgivable on a show like Doctor Who where they normally explain impossible things by attributing it to alien technology, this show just messed with the most basic laws of physics in the most ridiculous way ever.

Even if we accept that the moon was an egg, eggs can't just gain mass after birth. The creature would grow inside it by consuming the materials inside the egg, and not mysteriously and rapidly gain extra mass from the vacuum of space.

Then the completely random and poorly explained zero-g scene with only Courtney experiencing it was just absurd. It didn't help the story move forward. It was just the moon experiencing a highly localised, momentary loss of gravity. It seems like the scene was originally written based on the premise of the artificial gravity system failing, but they forgot to take it out when they decided that instead if artificial gravity, they would just make the moon heavier.

Then there's the fact that Courtney just happened to bring some bug spray with her that just happened to kill the alien bugs. Then there's the scene outside where Clara clearly sprays the bottle. You can even see the mist as it sprays. But then the other astronaut explains that it won't work in a vacuum.

And then the idea of the Doctor just leaving because he doesn't want to help. It's not like the Waters of Mars where he has the moral dilemma of knowing he can't alter human history and feels genuinely sad about not being able to help. This was just the Doctor deciding to fuck off leaving Clara and Courtney to potentially nuke themselves.

And on the beach, the doctor takes a few steps forward, looks down, the throws his head back and launches into a half-arsed, poorly delivered spiel about how humanity is destined for greatness.

Which is irrelevant.

When utilizing themes in writing you can utlize analogues that portray the theme in question without being a direct copy of the scenario.

----

And if I wanted to be pedantic I could argue that the Earth was the equivalent of a Male Seahorse. It provided the right conditions for the moon egg to hatch. The right temperature from the sun, the safety of Earth's orbit. The egg may have been laid by the creature, But the earth was it's habitat(which was the doctor's belief why it didn't then go and destroy the planet)

That Symbiotic relationship parrallel's that of the mother child relationship. The child needs the safety and comfort of the womb in order to develop and come to term.

---

If you don't want to see it as anti abortion etc that's fine.

Personally there's a strong abortion related theme in there, especially when you take lines like ""It's your moon, womankind it's your choice"" Which is pretty direct about the whole situation. Which wouldn't be an issue personally. Except for the fact that it portrayed the outcome in a such a hugely positive and nothing went wrong scenario. Which when overlaid with the it's a miracle/beautiful stuff that inspired Humanity to get their shit together and stop blowing shit up.

Could be argued to then be an analogue to growing up emotionally and responsibly after having a child.

The moon gave birth to a creature of beauty, that the earth had wanted to terminate and they realized that there is more than just themselves out there and made there way out into the stars.

Which most parents will say is that when they had kids their priorities and approach to things changed.

There are a bunch of analogues that surrond abortion, child-birth, maturity and the like in this episode. However I think that the way the episode approached it and the outcome at the end, is very much Happy Happy Hollywood land.

false,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; What is devo max defined as? From this thread it seems to be ""everything except foreign affairs and defence"".

There is no formal definition, however immediately prior to the referendum Alistair Darling was ""happy to call it [the future settlement] devo-max"", while Gordon Brown described it as ""a modern form of Scottish Home Rule"" and ""as close to federalism as you can have"".

So I think it's reasonable to expect that, yes, it's going to involve devolving most things beyond the UK's outwardly-facing powers.

&gt; Then there's the question of what Scotland should contribute to the UK, with one of the themes of devo max being that Scotland should keep all the money it raises. Some in this thread have said it should pay toward communal resources like the armed forces - how do you decide what Scotland should pay?

Per-capita (roughly 10%) is likely to be the starting point for any division, although you could see that being moved up or down slightly on a case by case basis.

&gt; What if Scotland runs into financial difficulties and this cost is more than it can afford?

What if the UK runs into financial difficulties and drags Scotland down with it?

&gt; Devo max is not the simple minor increase in powers you are making it out to be, it would significantly alter Scotland's relationship with the rest of the UK (becoming more like a crown dependency of the UK rather than a part of it).

It would certainly cause a significant change in the UK's internal political structure, but that's kind of the point. It would not take Scotland into a crown dependency status, nor would it take Scotland out of the UK - Scotland would continue to participate in that union.

&gt; It would involve a substantial increase in workload and responsibility for the scottish parliament and civil service, which has absolutely no experience in many of the reserved areas that would be devolved under devo max.

I think that's overselling the difficulty of it. Devolution has not been a single static event - new bodies such as [Revenue Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue_Scotland) are already being created.

&gt; More importantly it's something that hasn't been debated very much, nor has a consistent definition been agreed upon. Why, then, does it shock you that some Scottish people may not want to go for this on a whim?

Some people will always oppose anything they think could lead to independence, purely as a matter of principle.

However the majority of people in Scotland do support increased responsibility within the UK. That politicians have yet to agree on what that means is kind of beside the point, as all anti-independence politicians agreed that a significant extension of new powers to Scotland would happen in the event of a No vote.",0,1412584425,null,0,false,0,cl1qlkb,t3_2icp2j,t1_cl1qlkb,t1_cl1dfty,null,1426661933,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

&gt;

&gt;The __SAMPSON__ is a multi-function dual-face [active electronically scanned array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_electronically_scanned_array) [radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar) produced by [BAE Systems Maritime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAE_Systems_Maritime_%E2%80%93_Naval_Ships). It is the fire control radar component of the Sea Viper naval air defence system, previously designated [PAAMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAAMS)(S) to distinguish it from the PAAMS system on the Franco-Italian Horizon Class.

&gt;The SAMPSON multi function radar can detect all types of targets out to a distance of 400 km, and is capable of tracking hundreds of targets at any one time. Sea Viper uses this information to assess and command target priorities, and calculate the optimum launch time for its Aster missiles.

I didn't see this as a referendum on abortion, but rather on a referendum on faith.  The seed of a great idea is in this, and it was completely betrayed by flaws in premise and execution.

This is what I would have liked to hear the Doctor say:

""Clara, you three have to make this decision yourselves, because I'm not the only one who has to make the tough decisions.  I can't be.  Yes, I know more than pretty much anybody, but I can't know everything, and I can't make every decision.  And if you keep looking to me and asking 'Is this right?' or looking for my permission, then you're not *thinking* Clara.  That's not thinking, that's just blind faith.  I'm not a god; you can't just pray to me and ask that my will be done.  Because in the end, Clara, I don't want your soul; I want your mind.""

And then later Clara could have said something to the notion that it is her soul that informs her mind, and her soul says ""Nope, not nuking a baby in orbit.""

Also, I think it would have been better if they'd had to make a judgment call.  Like if half the lights on earth were on and half were off.  (Never mind the notion that convincing civil authorities in under an hour that turning out the lights in NY would seem like a good idea, because what could possibly go wrong in a total blackout in NY.)

2 Chronicles 15:12-13

&gt;""That scoundrels among you are leading their fellow citizens astray by saying, âLet us go worship other godsââgods you have not known before.  In such cases, you must examine the facts carefully. If you find that the report is true and such a detestable act has been committed among you,  you must attack that town and completely destroy[a] all its inhabitants, as well as all the livestock. Then you must pile all the plunder in the middle of the open square and burn it. Burn the entire town as a burnt offering to the Lord your God. That town must remain a ruin forever; it may never be rebuilt. Keep none of the plunder that has been set apart for destruction. Then the Lord will turn from his fierce anger and be merciful to you. He will have compassion on you and make you a large nation, just as he swore to your ancestors.""

Ye shall walk after the Lord your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him. And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death; because he hath spoken to turn you away from the Lord your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to thrust thee out of the way which the Lord thy God commanded thee to walk in. So shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee. If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers; Namely, of the gods of the people which are round about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him:But thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people. And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.""

Religions are simply what people chose to make of them, it's why they are so often deeply contradictory in an objective sense and this is really the point. The ""truth"", the ""message"" is a personal one and asking the question ""who lived most truly to the message"" is a call for people to examine the whole of the work and decide what they want to take away from it. 

Given there's an awful lot more about peace, compassion, love and a personal relationship with god it's not exactly crazy to suggest that these are the core of the message.  ",0,1412588641,null,0,false,0,cl1r9ym,t3_2ids7i,t1_cl1r9ym,t1_cl1q96n,null,1426661617,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

He makes his own bias quite clear early on in the video when he says, sarcastically âIf you had a few dollars in the bank youâd be happier if the government took it away from you.â Then goes on to attack it because he doesnât approve of its supporters, a slide titled âHail The Prophetsâ.  No bias there.

He supposes that the inevitable gaps in Wilkinsonâs proposal would undermine it, but only selectively presents data himself â when it supports his thesis, a researcherâs mortal sin he names early on, finding Saunders guilty. If he has data to undermine the thesis he should present it. For example, that Wilkinson presented data on homicides but not suicides is given as a reason to disbelieve the idea â as if itâs possible to come up with a thesis that includes every possible metric. Iâd like to see an open debate between both parties because some of Saundersâ criticisms e.g. on Japan and USA data points seem easy to refute, even to me. 

It would be naive to think that there are no factors at all, and no data, which undermine the theory, as with any complex situation. There are huge numbers of variables, a huge amount of data, so a critique saying âhere are several things they didnât look atâ is hardly a credible attack. 

What most people (who arenât sociologists) donât know is the data in support of income equality, and I think they should.

You stating that Wilkinsonâs position is polemical, implying that Saundersâ isnât, is itself interesting. Saundersâ bias is very evident. So is yours.

It presented us with 2 morally abhorrent options in which compromises had to be made, and then, at the very last second, introduced a 3rd option which had all of the benefits of both and the consequences of neither. How is that excellent?

There was **zero** good reason that he couldn't have hopped in the TARDIS and done some research.  Especially since Twelve seems to be a lot more precise with the time controls than most Doctors. 

Like, that's what Ten did with the Rachnid Queen.  He just zoomed backwards to figure out where the hell she came from.  There's no reason at all Twelve couldn't do that here and, frankly, I have a suspicion that's *exactly* what he did when he bailed on the party...  but without bothering to tell the humans what he discovered.

It was utterly witholding, especially considering that (if he's telling the truth about the grey spots) even HE couldn't have known whether the thing that hatched was going to eat the Earth or something.   I mean, monsters that lay eggs disguised as moons so they can then eat the planet unawares?  That's downright reasonable in the Whoniverse.

But no, Twelve wanted to watch the monkeys dance.

Twelve is being written into a domineering, controlling, psychologically abusive bully.  He's got all the worst traits of One, Three, Six, and Seven with virtually none of their redeeming qualities.

As a side note, I want to be clear that I **LOVE** Capaldi and what he's bringing to the role.  He *could* be one of the best Doctors ever.

In my experience, fruit from greengrocers is quite a lot better than you get in supermarkets - maybe because food is bought everyday by someone with expertise, at a market from competing sellers, rather than delivered through some monolithic distribution system - or maybe because they tend to stock fruit which is in season, or they're not so worried about how pretty it is. I had a lot of fruit from Waitrose which was just useless - dry oranges, pears that never ripen etc.

One potential way to bring greengrocers back would be to borrow from the system they have in Spain (where fruit is usually superb and cheap). They have a lot more variety in the sizes of shops - the same sort of large and medium shops you get in Britain, but also very small places that are basically market stalls built into the shop front. These are dotted around all over the city, aren't expected to open all day, and might have a variety of different businesses - for instance, from six in the morning to eleven selling Churros, but in Britain it could be a greengrocer, or a baker, a small takeaway, or whatever. In general, we need to make it easier for ordinary people to start shops, takeaways, etc, so you don't need to sign up for enormous floorspace, and hopefully, not a minimum ten year lease, both of which mean that trying out a new idea is a huge financial risk, beyond most of the population to even attempt.

Well I said civil service not NHS. And i'm pretty sure, though legislation is hypothetically there to curb it since 2013. It's not impossible to get a 'golden goodbye' for voluntary redundancy in the region of 100k. 

In fact its capped at 150k.

Sure its 4 times less what your suggesting, but I believe the bone of contention was that large redundancy packages did not exist. 

Thus, I would point you to the case of Charlotte Cane.

&gt;What's that got to do with anything? 

Well the issue is access is it not. If its an efficiency issue then there appears to be no strong empirical evidence either way. 

As i've said, is the issue access, well access does not apparently seem to be impacted.

Is the issue effiency? Well then we have a inconclusive set of data points.

&gt;how do you then come back with ""well their just as bad"". No they're not - their far, far worse.

false,orwellsocietyguy,null,null,"Ticket prices aren't worked out on any type of 'system'. Years ago I had the misfortune to work for the company designing the ticketing system. G4S and Serco were involved (of course).

The system is designed to throw back a result that 'looks' like you're getting the cheapest ticket and push you towards a purchase. After a certain period of time that price will increase regardless. However it depends on 

1. Where you are buying it. If it's from a kiosk the price will automatically go up 24 hrs before regardless of sales. Many kiosk machines will sell you a full price ticket despite the train being oversubscribed. 3rd party sites add costs in clever ways.

2. Time of day. Peak rates are higher regardless - no matter when they're bought. An open single at 5pm to manchester 27 weeks in advance is just as ludicrously priced as as one later today.

3. Date - book weeks in advance and you can get a cheaper price - but if it's xmas/popular holiday/football event/etc and the train isn't even half full its STILL expensive.

4. (a) The provider - many providers cross in to other territories. Virgin did a Â£15 return to manchester because it can control the price end to end. Many providers have to 'handshake' to get you from A to B.

4. (b) The route - some routes are direct one way - non direct on return. Interchanges between different providers also add to the complexity. Some providers have different peak times and different sized trains. Interchange from Southern to Northern and that last little interchange can be 65% of the total price. You can start off-peak and interchange at peak times.

6. The popularity - Journeys like Manchester to London will have pre-programmed prices. Regardless of times these trains are always busy so huge hikes happen because they know the demand is so high amongst people 'who can afford it'. (Â£299 one way to London?!)

7. The flexibility of the ticket. Buy an open single and you may as well throw money down the toilet on some journeys.

In terms of the 'prisoners' vote' issue, the reference has to do with that a blank cheque removal of the vote in itself is contrary to the convention. If people were to realise that a system where depending on what crime you have committed then you aren't allowed to vote in certain circumstances. It's about understanding the gravity of the crime, and the proportionality of the punishment. 

Is it appropriate for someone whom is in for 20 years to life to have the vote? no probably not. Is it appropriate to remove the right to vote for someone whom is in for 6 months for petty theft? The element of proportionality here would only be what common sense would apply.

It will be interesting to see how Clara exits the show, particularly if Pink begins traveling with the Doctor.

With regards to the killing of homosexuals, there is a difference here between simply being a man or woman with homosexual feelings (which elicits no punishment in Islam) and actually practicing homsexuality, which is punishable in Islam. However there is a great deal of debate within Islam as to whether homosexuality falls under the category of 'making mischief in the land' which is one of the two categories of crime eligible for the death penalty. 

 Similarly, islam has strict criteria under which someone can be prosecuted for anything like a sexual misconduct. In the case of women, 4 witnesses are needed, and if this cannot be provided, then the women is deemed innocent of any wrongdoing and the accusers are not only flogged but barred from giving testimony ever again. For men, there exists this verse, which seems to suggest flogging is also the prescribed punishment for any sexual misconduct:

&gt;""The woman and the man guilty of adultery or fornication,- flog each of them with a hundred stripes: Let not compassion move you in their case, in a matter prescribed by God, if ye believe in God and the Last Day: and let a party of the Believers witness their punishment.

false,joeflux,null,null,"&gt; Last time I checked a census revealed that 59% of people living in the UK define their religion as Christian.

Yeah I wondered if you would bring that up.  You might have noticed, but people state that they are Christian even when they don't actually believe the Christian faith.

Read this:

&gt; When asked why they think of themselves as Christian, the research found that fewer than three in ten (28%) say one of the reasons is that they believe in the teachings of Christianity. People are much more likely to consider themselves to be Christian because they were christened or baptised into the religion (72%) or because their parents were members of the religion (38%) than because of personal belief.  

https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/2921/Religious-and-Social-Attitudes-of-UK-Christians-in-2011.aspx

And:

&gt; Just a third (32%) believe Jesus was physically resurrected, with one in five (18%) not believing in the resurrection even in a spiritual sense; half (49%) do not think of Jesus as the Son of God, with one in twenty-five (4%) doubting he existed at all.

So only a third of self-labelled ""Christians"" believe that Jesus was physically resurrected!

And again it's interesting that you so try to hard to dodge the issue, and try to just point blame at others.

So you do believe the Quran then, and believe that gay people should be punished?  And perhaps even the Hadiths, and believe that gay people should be killed?

As I said there's no atheist groups hassling women outside abortion clinics. There are atheist groups counter acting Catholic anti-abortion groups though.

&gt; My Grandad fucking hates gay people,

So is he part of an atheist gay hate group? No. He's just an old bigot from a time where the popular line of thinking was that of the church. Irrelevant.

&gt; My Auntie is a CoE vicar, she, while not a fan of abortions (who is?)

Abortions are hotly contested and a well defended right of every progressive nation in the world. Itâs abhorrent that Catholics use this in the way they do to oppress women.

&gt; She's also a campaigner to allow people in homosexual relationships to be vicars.

Good for her, but I doubt if you go to gay pride you'll find the religious people in droves. Gay rights have been overly, heavily suppressed by many faiths for centuries.

&gt; The acting like they represent everything that's good and right and logical in the world

You seem to think this is unique to atheists. People are assholes about EVERYTHING - get over it. I've been called a 'fucking sheeple-retard' by a kid half my age (and probably half my IQ) for my choice of phone. Iâve been shouted at in the street and told ânot to breedâ for my choice of car. People on here who vote UKIP are called âracist scumâ.

&gt; Atheists commandeering 'science' and making the debate 'science vs religion' is hugely destructive.

Not everyone has advanced debating skills. People should be allowed to be wrong about things - utterly wrong. The church has had 2000 years of being really damn shitty in very large groups to millions of people. Now it's the atheists turn it has to happen in order for progress to continue. Whatâs destructive is shutting the debate down.

&gt; Stalin was an out and out atheist. Hitler could best be described as agnostic

Stalin was psychopath. He thought he WAS god. Hitlerâs faith is still debated - he was not raised agnostic and was also a delusional tyrant who thought he was 'more than just a man' - he also wasn't the entirety of the Nazi regime who were mostly Catholic. The SS wasn't an agnostic group. There was no agnostic or atheistic ideologies publicly transmitted. The Vatican wasn't held back by agnostic groups when they backed the regime. The vatican didn't ex-communicate any of the leading members of the SS. Agnostic group leaders werenât put in to leading positions in any of the groups Hitler set up.

&gt; you can't be smart and have a religion has the potential to be far more damaging than a couple of rogue schools

No it's not. There's not a 'few rogue schools'. There's not large atheists groups demanding that people HAVE to learn anything other than what we've spent hundreds of years agree is a good thing. Leading atheists do not say this. Sam Harris, Dawkins, Hitchens never said ANYTHING like that - they all have openly admitted they have close, life-long religious friends. 

&gt; trying to (illegally) teach kids creationism.

It's not ""illegal"" to teach bullshit in faith schools. Dawkins has been campaigning against this since the 1970's. He didn't just write a book and all of a sudden atheists came out of the woodwork. We only just banned teaching creationism in publicly funded schools THIS year. Private schools can teach what they like. Thereâs 7,000 of them. Stop belittling the debate.

&gt;making the debate 'science vs religion' 

Atheists haven't 'made this the debate'. This goes back thousand of years to ""why are we here and who created the universe?â. Stephen Hawking didn't 'come out' because he wanted to control the debate - he did it because religious people were quote mining and twisting the few words we have of his.

No bias there.

Saunders' summary of Wilkinson's book is entirely fair and accurate. Yes he is a man with political opinions, but the same charge can be laid against Wilkinson, so they are on an even keel there. 

&gt; He supposes that the inevitable gaps in Wilkinsonâs proposal would undermine it, but only selectively presents data himself â when it supports his thesis, a researcherâs mortal sin he names early on, finding Saunders guilty. 

It simply is easier to disprove something than prove it, and that is the nature of research. He has done that conclusively, and the fact he does not have an iron cast alternative thesis does not matter. His attack is also far more extensive than your summary would imply. 

&gt; You stating that Wilkinsonâs position is polemical, implying that Saundersâ isnât, is itself interesting. Saundersâ bias is very evident. So is yours. 

Saunders' work is not polemical, he merely dismantles a theory. I do have political opinions that would tend towards Saunders' view rather than Wilkinson's, but Saunders' theory that ethics is basically a matter of opinion as opposed to something that can be scientifically demonstrated is more mild than Wilkinson's, and thus requires less evidence.

You pick an MP from a short list.

The Queen chooses a Prime Minister - in order to convince her you need evidence that you have enough support. There's no actual need in statute for parties, they are just the organised effect of policy swapping in order to guarantee support.

In theory you could have 650 independent MPs, of whom one of them talks to a bunch of MPs and decides he has enough support. Then he goes to the Queen and she declares him head of her government. I'm not quite sure how it works since fixed term parliaments (a recent change), but it used to be that various bills (of which the Budget is the main one) are Supply Bills which act as a motion of confidence in the government. If you lost one of those you had to call a general election.

There used to be occasions where MPs swapped between the main parties (more so back when the main parties were the Liberals and Labour). Now they mostly just switch to independent. This can happen when a party 'withdraws the whip' i.e... no longer supports the MP or encourages them to vote for a bill.

Party whips draw their power from the idea that loyal MPs are rewarded with offices (which translates to extra pay and responsibility). Of course for large rebellions, you can't just kick them all out of the party or you'd risk them voting against a supply bill and you being forced to call an election.

false,LocutusOfBorges,,Liberal Democrat  | /r/LibDem,"&gt; My biggest issue with the Lib Dems however, is that I do not know where they stand as a party. I know roughly speaking what labour stand for and what the conservatives stand for. I even know what UKIP and the Greens stand for. But the Lib Dems don't seem to have a firm footing in terms of policy, they are very much caught in the wind. It's all very wishy washy and I've yet to see any Lib Dem policies that are distinctly theirs.

The Lib Dems' positioning's been fairly consistent for the past twenty years, really. It's just [social liberalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_liberalism) updated for the contemporary stage. 

They've plenty of other core positions- things like the Â£10,000 personal allowance were Liberal Democrat ideas from their inception, and their position on things like drug policy, international aid and civil liberties/human rights are well known- they've always been in favour of drawing up a codified British constitution, and they've been significantly more liberal on social issues (gay marriage, for example) than the other two for a fair while. 

The civil liberties point bears mentioning, as well- they're not perfect, by any stretch- but they do seem to be the only effective party in British politics to consider them a fundamental concern. Even within this coalition- while the Secret Courts vote passed with Lib Dem approval (or at worst, abstension), they're also the party that pushed the hardest for the scrapping of the ID Card scheme, retired Control Orders and blocked things like the Snoopers Charter. One of the biggest things they forced onto the agenda in 2010 was the [Protection of Freedoms Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection_of_Freedoms_Act_2012)- more or less targeted squarely at sweeping away the worst of New Labour's authoritarian legislation. 

That's not even getting onto the wider constitutional reform points- electoral system reform, conversion of the Lords into an elected chamber, greater devolution, increased localism, and the like. 

The Lib Dems stand for plenty of things. People just don't bother listening.",0,1412599571,null,0,false,0,cl1tikp,t3_2ie15s,t1_cl1tikp,t1_cl1tb66,null,1426660572,3,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,3

For all the faults of both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats at least they have raised the threshold of tax to allow low wage earners in my family to take home more of their pay and by extension raise their standard of living. Labour need to seize policies like this, instead of promising to maintain what has already been done. UKIP and the Conservatives promising to have no tax on the minimum wage is very enticing, a pragmatic policy for those of us near the bottom. Labour should have been doing this when they were in power already.

What is gravely concerning about Labour is that Milliband in particular uses many buzzwords, likes to talk about ""fairness"" and ""equality"" but is not promising anything pragmatic.

It is if you're sacked. 100k isn't 400k. This sucks and the private sector rubs your face in it more. It's a prime example of how these things are unregulated.

&gt; large redundancy packages did not exist.

My point was that no one gets this sickening amount for failing at their job after 6 months.

&gt; well access does not apparently seem to be impacted.

Are you blind? Does ""there arenât enough nurses"" qualify as access to decent healthcare to you? It's not 'access' full stop. It's 'access to decent healthcare'.

&gt; Why is having private entities involved in healthcare a fundamentally bad thing?

It's not - I work for a private company that supplies services TO the NHS. I'm completely in favour of innovation and excellence in the NHS. Of all the department heads I know in the NHS in any high performing trust NONE of them would say this.

&gt;what is your bone of contention exactly

I'm against the privatisation of healthcare trusts. I'm against local groups having to spend so much time and money fighting against privatisation when they DONT want it. I'm against decisions being made in private. I'm against one of the best systems of care in the world being carved up and taken away from us because of corporate interest. I'm against having to spend so much time repeatedly taking our Health Minister to court only to find out he's both wrong and has acted illegally. I'm against draconian measures that are universally unpopular with health advisors, the public and just about everyone who's not a private company coming in to play. This isn't a two sided argument - it's 5-1.

&gt; Because most of this debate simply comes down to 'PRIVATIZATION HISS BOO'.

People on here get puritanical about drug use, I get pretty puritanical about violence. A person, in a civilised and functioning society, has no reason to commit an act of aggression against another human being (with the exception of organised sport).
The fact that people often think that fights are a normal part of society is abhorrent and a danger to society.

I don't know your situation, so I won't pass judgement but there are different forms and conditions for aggravated assault. Sometimes the crime can seem justified. The kind of mental shit that would beat someone in a taxi for ""talking to his woman"" should be kept away from society until it can be shown that he is no longer going to go off the rails over nothing.

I have been a victim of random violence and I know a few friends that have too. It is unacceptable and people should be kept of the streets if there is threat to the safety of others. These ABH and GBH charges treated with the same level of disregard as a burglary.

I agree you donât need the correct answer to dispute someoneâs claim to have found it (and I never said otherwise) but when you do dispute their claims you need to present evidence, which Saunders did on some occasions but not on others, which inconsistency should be a concern. When he did present his own numbers Iâd contend his conclusions were sometimes worthy of debate but far from conclusive. Things like this are nuanced and complex and debate should take place, but when you and Saunders say the opinions of another are wholly disproved, basically youâre completely right and Wilkinson is completely wrong, I have to believe thatâs evidence of your own bias and little to do with Wilkinson or open debate about the data.

A disagreement about the meaning of âpolemicalâ would be tedious, but according to the definition Iâd say Saundersâ attack qualifies far more than Wilkinsonâs opinions. Wilkinson proposed a theory, the critical attack came from Saunders, after all.

Of course I realize they're different characters, this comes from first knowing Capaldi as Malcolm Tucker and thinking it would be funny, as the same actor is now the doctor, if the doctor would become as profane as Tucker, especially as the show is historically so child-friendly. 

Additionally, while Capaldi is a brilliant and skillful actor, his demeanor and presentational style really is not much different in his role as the doctor than his role as Malcolm Tucker. I mean this to say that it doesn't represent as much of a completely different person as Hal and Walter White. I would imagine this was intentional as Moffat likely wanted a darker and more aggressive doctor and may have been inspired by Capaldi's performance as Tucker.

As an aside, there was a theory going around in the latter days of Breaking Bad that the show would end with Walt going into witness protection and becoming Hal from Malcolm in the Middle. People get used to an actor in a certain role, especially if the actor is well-known and founded in that role; when the actor transitions to a different role, there is still a ""taint"" of the prior role on them, which can sometimes lead to imaginative theories/thoughts and hilarity (just look at the youtube clips of Capaldi swearing at Daleks and Cybermen).

tl;dr Relax, I wasn't wanting a lecture on the science of acting, nor was I wondering how stories and characters work.

Three main colours:

* Red (Ruby + the various vintage varieties) - rich, jammy, soft fruits, sometimes a touch of tannin, varying amounts of woodiness

* Tawny (straw coloured) - more like a dessert wine, often sweeter but less of the soft fruit jammyness. Always aged in wood, usually labelled with the number of years spent in there, often will change with age as a result. A colheita is a single-vintage tawny, regular tawny is a blend.

* White - much lighter in colour, often but not always aged in wooden barrels (the longer spent in there, the darker the colour). Tastes much lighter and fresher than the other two, usually served chilled more like an aperitif than a big heavy after-dinner drink.

Of the reds, they're usually broken down into:

* Ruby - bog standard, red wine + brandy, aged for a bit in steel or concrete vats then filtered. As it's filtered its character won't really change with age. Often lacks complex flavours or the sort of smooth refinement you get with the varieties which have had time to chill out in a wooden barrel for a while. ""Reserve"" or other such fancy names are just the slightly better end of this category.

* Vintage - the good shit, from a single year which has been declared a ""vintage"" year. Has had at least a couple of years in wood, and the stuff bottled as vintage is the top two thirds of the barrel (with less crusty stuff in it - see below) bottled unfiltered. As a result, it will change with age even after bottling. Needs to be handled carefully and decanted before serving as it's got sediment in it.

* Late-bottled vintage - from one or more ""vintage"" years, spends a lot longer in the barrel than vintage and is (usually) filtered before bottling. As a result, it's done most of its maturation in the barrel and so won't really change a whole bunch once in the bottle and you don't have to decant before serving. 

* Crusted - consists of a blend of the bottom third of barrels from left from vintage bottlings. Heavy on the sediment, sometimes unpredictable, sometimes brilliant. Poor man's vintage port (and my favourite).

If you're buying a whole bunch for an event, I'd recommend getting a decent LBV as it's stable, generally well-rounded and easy drinking and doesn't require decanting.

Thinking about it, Hating on might imply a more repetative form of criticising - after a match you critique the players, but if one (see: Torres, although that was more vindicated) goes on a few games of poor form he'll be picked up on and every time he makes mistakes people will criticise him, even if he also did contribute in other areas.  
Ramires is a good example - I personally 'hate on' Ramires quite a lot since he lacks technical quality in what is otherwise a technically skilled squad so if he does play and keeps wasting chances by fluffing shots or passes then I'll be the first to criticise him.

I wouldn't say so. I doubt Wilkinson would find much to disagree with in the summary of his book. 

&gt; People who write papers, or dispute papers, usually have opinions on the subject at hand but Saundersâ undermines his points, in my opinion, by the sarcastic comments which are wholly unnecessary and betray a very strong personal bias. 

Bias in this sense is another word for ad hominem. A relevant criticism of his point would be to attack the data he has selected or the methods he has used to analyse it, which to be fair you have done so below. But your above comments are aimed at style, not substance.

&gt; Saying, for example, that removing extremes like the USA and Japan from data changes the resultsâ¦.well, no kidding. You could take any data set and selectively add or remove samples to make your point, and do that forever. That doesnât mean the data lacks meaning.

As he outlines early in his talk, a number of rich countries were excluded from the study for no obvious reason, with some being richer than Portugal, which was included. There are also inconsistencies with how Wilkinson has portrayed the book, attempting to claim it is both groundbreaking and simply a summary of an existing consensus.

I think you call Saunders more polemical because you dislike his politics, not because his view is more polemical. I view Wilkinson as polemical because I believe he contrived the data to support his view rather than to legitimately test a hypothesis, and a very bold hypothesis at that.

false,jfredett,tardis,TARDIS,"Hmm, well -- it would be odd then to see it happen so rapidly, and I suspect adding very much mass at all would fuck with a lot more than just the tides. In particular, the additional gravitational force would put a lot of stress on the earth itself. There are 'land tides' too, in a sense, the Moon exerts some force across the whole of the earth, the water just happens to be the only thing that moves significantly enough to be noticed. The additional mass would also put the moon in a decaying orbit, afaik, unless it's speed increased too, so we have to assume that some proportion of the energy absorbed by the shell is expended in some sort of undetectable engine to increase it's orbital velocity. Looking through [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_equation) wikipedia article, it seems that that jives with the math.

Now, we can pretty easily calculate the amount of increase in mass needed to get the tides to tsunami-like levels or 'tens of meters' (see the comment parallel to this experimenting with distance), in a very similar fashion. Here we just take:

    F = G * m1 * m2 / r^2

and look at the ratio:

    (G * m1 * (m2 + x) / r^2) / (G * m1 * m2 / r^2)

to find that we really just need to look at:

     (m2 + x) / m2

If we want a k-fold increase in gravitational force then:

       (m2 + x) / m2 = k
    =&gt; m2 + x = k*m2
    =&gt; x = (k-1)*m2
    
Which makes sense, a doubling of force would require a doubling of mass, i.e., adding one lunar mass to the moon. Now, that is *a lot* of mass, and as noted above, the Doctor only stated that '1.3e9 tonnes' were added, or 1.77e-9 lunar masses, which would only increase the amount of gravity exerted by the moon by an unnoticeably small factor (seriously, wolfram alpha spat out `2.188e20 N` for this, and `2.188e20 N` for w/o the additional mass as well, well past the point of accuracy). Even moving the moon as close as is reasonable (1750km, see the other comment for details on that), leaves the change unnoticeable from not adding the mass.

So unless the moon's mass went up by a factor of 1.5 or better, we probably wouldn't even notice the tides being all that much higher, except in areas with normally extreme tides (like the Bay of Fundy, which claims it has the largest tides in the world at 16m, at that height, even the `1.009`-fold increase would result in about 14.4cm higher tides, which might flood someones basement, or something).

This is basically a report on previous problems with private/defined-contribution pension schemes. Poorly defined investments, making it difficult for investors to know where their money is going; high charges that strip away the gains; and opaque management.

Current regulations in the UK are much better and should prevent most of these problems. For example, my defined-contribution pension scheme is very clear about the fund my money is going in, the charges I will incur (something like 0.25%) and how the investment will be smoothed toward my retirement date. I have control over these aspects. If these things weren't clear, the charges were too high or I had little control over where the money went, I would be hesitant about investing. Only hesitant because as it's a company scheme though, the immediate 150% gain I get on my investment is a bit of a no-brainer.

As for the quoted poor returns in the article, perhaps some of them are the result of looking at the range 2000-2012/13 considering that covers two global recessions?

&gt;Since pension pots are often consumersâ second-biggest asset (after their house), this lapse is both astonishing and alarming.

As is the lapse by the investors. They can't abdicate responsibility for their investment decisions just because 'money is hard', or more accurately because 'the government wouldn't let me lose out'. That someone else in here has likened it to the mortgage endowment mis-selling is apposite. That was a case where people thought they could get a deal that was too good to be true then threw their hands in the air when it turned out that there would be a shortfall.

I'm not saying its the result of anything, I'm arguing that we should have a system that is designed to protect the public, not one that focuses on punishment.
If we can demonstrate people have reformed I have no problem releasing them, but you have violent individuals that have been arrested 2 or 3 times getting released back into the wild and repeating the same crime again. 
In most cases, they aren't even refereed for counselling or follow ups, just let off.

They are a literal danger to society, the should be kept away from us until we can show they aren't a threat. For all I care, their prison could be a five star hotel on a Caribbean island.

Ad hominem would be an attack on the person â such as you assuming Iâm a leftist (as a pejorative) without knowing anything about me except that I think the video is worth watching. When I point out a clear bias, as evidenced by sarcastic language, itâs an attack on the bias, not the person. If Iâm attacking something itâs what the person does, in this context, not what the person is. Conflate the two if it pleases you though. For what it's worth I'm liberal in some areas, conservative in others and I try to keep an open mind. In this matter I believe you've already admitted your mind is made up.

One thing that Wilkinson does in his talk is make it clear that the data is available to everybody, heâs gone out of his way to make that clear. If he excluded certain data points itâs possible he has reasons and he should be asked to explain, but to summarily dismiss everything heâs done is not valid. As Saunders points out, there are special factors in certain countries and regions and it would be foolish to ignore those â and even if Wilkinson was shown to have omitted data with no good reason it would undermine his argument somewhat, but certainly not entirely.

Whether the book was portrayed as groundbreaking or derivative is hardly relevant to a criticism of its thesis, itâs closer to a marketing strategy than anything else. This is a spurious objection having nothing whatever to do with the nature of equality. That itâs raised as a material point is a weakness of Saundersâ position. Not a major one, itâs just silly and unworthy as a scholarly rebuttal.

Hereâs a definition of polemical, the first tossed up by Google and there are doubtless others:

1.	poâ¢lemâ¢iâ¢cal
pÉËlemÉk(É)l/
adjective
adjective: polemical
1.	of, relating to, or involving strongly critical, controversial, or disputatious writing or speech.
""a polemical essay""
synonyms:	critical, hostile, bitter, polemic, virulent, vitriolic, venomous, caustic, trenchant, cutting, acerbic, sardonic, sarcastic, scathing, sharp, incisive, devastating 
""the first of his polemical essays against modernism""
 
Iâd say Saunders meets the definition quite well. Wilkinson may be mistaken but his presentation appeared to be earnest and positive in spirit, not attacking anyone but suggesting a better way,

false,_tpyo,dorset,Dorset,"a few definitions exist. This is the broad one that to me at least doesn't make any sense. It's just another excuse to ignore critics and keep the blinkers on.  
The definition I accept is that tone policing is where you _undermine_ a persons argument due to their tone. The classic example is calling someone hysterical and/or crazy and ignoring their argument completely. 

The ""out of context"" i'm referencing was an argument between two other feminists somewhere in SRS. One of them got the wrong end of the stick of what the other one said and basically lost their shit and I tried to point out they'd misunderstood the other person and overreacted.  
Perma-banned for tone policing.  

I mean seriously, what the shit? I get banned for trying to break up a fight that has occurred due to a mis-understanding. Is that not a good thing? I could have just ignored both of the fuckers and let them wallow in their pointless argument.....  

I'm sorry to be rude but reading more that link definition it just sounds like a ""do it yourself kit"" for self-inflicted mental illness. I appreciate its borne from dealing with genuine trolls and that sort of shit is insufferable but once you take it into the real world you just end up shadow boxing because with such a broad definition anyone that disagrees with you is suddenly an enemy. How does someone with this technology know if they are ever overreacting or being unreasonable? Are you seriously telling me they require someone of their own race, gender, sexual identity and sexual orientation before they'll listen (same level of privilege)?  
If that's the case then feminism is completely and utterly fucked, flipped on its head and now represents the opposite of what it set out to do in the first place.  

I mean if we're talking privilege then are we blind to the fact we were all young once? I have a massive chip on my shoulder due to the tone policing I suffered from adults as a child:  

&gt; you're crying because you know you're wrong  

but because I'm male and cis and white Its impossible for me to empathise with that argument, rite?  
I fucking despair.

I think Saunders' summary of the Spirit Level's hypothesis is fair and accurate, and I think Wilkinson would agree. 

&gt; Ad hominem would be an attack on the person â such as you assuming Iâm a leftist (as a pejorative) without knowing anything about me except that I think the video is worth watching

I think that's a logical assumption. I don't happen to think the ideas are much worthy of general engagement, even if they are of interest to the specialists in the field. I am generally critical of equality as a concept, for the record.

&gt; One thing that Wilkinson does in his talk is make it clear that the data is available to everybody, heâs gone out of his way to make that clear. If he excluded certain data points itâs possible he has reasons and he should be asked to explain, but to summarily dismiss everything heâs done is not valid.

Saunders' even says in his talk that Wilkinson has refused to address some of these specific criticisms, of which you can see more examples below.  

&gt; Whether the book was portrayed as groundbreaking or derivative is hardly relevant to a criticism of its thesis, itâs closer to a marketing strategy than anything else. This is a spurious objection having nothing whatever to do with the nature of equality. That itâs raised as a material point is a weakness of Saundersâ position. Not a major one, itâs just silly and unworthy as a scholarly rebuttal.

It's relevant to the argument because Wilkinson has sought to marginalise his critics by claiming his view is accepted by the majority within the field, which is not the case. 

&gt; Iâd say Saunders meets the definition quite well. Wilkinson may be mistaken but his presentation appeared to be earnest and positive in spirit, not attacking anyone but suggesting a better way.

In what sense is Wilkinson not making an argument? I suppose all science is polemic by that definition, but the term is generally used to classify political thesis. Most people wouldn't refer to a historical essay as polemic, for instance, despite that usually involving an argument of some sort.

I demonstrated the contradiction simply by posting the contradictory statements side by side. What followed after was an insult, but it wasn't central to my point.

&gt; Religions are simply what people chose to make of them, it's why they are so often deeply contradictory in an objective sense and this is really the point. The ""truth"", the ""message"" is a personal one and asking the question ""who lived most truly to the message"" is a call for people to examine the whole of the work and decide what they want to take away from it.

&gt; Given there's an awful lot more about peace, compassion, love and a personal relationship with god it's not exactly crazy to suggest that these are the core of the message. 

You are simultaneously contending that its up to people what they take from a book but that the core of the message is the nice parts on the basis that they take up more of the books. Actually I doubt that the nice bits do take up most of the books, and from what I've read irrationality, bigotry and violence occupy a large part of the Biblical narrative.

It doesn't hurt to let your cigars age for a wee while, buying them now and smoking them in march should only be a good thing for them.  

For myself, I like a minimum of 1 month before I smoke, which means that they've had time to settle and adapt to the humidity/temp of my tupperdor. some people age some cigars 5 years +! it's all preference really.

&gt; If I do have to age in a tupperdor, what Boveda pack should I go for? 62/69/72? Is there a rough length of time to age?

I use the 69 boveda packs, it's essential that you have a hygrometer/temperature device in there as well (they're cheap enough on Amazon) so that you can monitor the humidity and temperature. 

I bought the 10 pack of 8gram boveda 69s [link](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Boveda-Humidipak-Medium-Humidity-Control/dp/B00JV27MFY/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1412606400&amp;sr=8-7&amp;keywords=boveda), they're little sachets that are particularly good for shipping. 

In an air tight container like a tupperware box, it's harder for the box to cool down, so having the mini packs means you can add/remove them to maintain the correct temp/humidity - i have about 5 in mine at the moment (the tupperware box size also makes a difference on how many you need to use. 

&gt; There is a B&amp;M shop near me in Glasgow that I could pick up a single to try, but again, if I buy a single should it be aged first?

again, i'd leave it in there a month personally - just to settle and then smoke away and see if you like it. especially if you're looking at dropping Â£100+

&gt; So, if the Secretos are good then hurrah!

Not had them myself, but they're a solid 4/5 on cigar-review.org! so smoke away!

You should take advantage of the lack of responsibilities by saving. Starting adult life with Â£10,000 in the bank has a huge positive impact on your quality of life, the options available to you and the choices you can make. If you start adult life with nothing you're behind where you want to be and you'll have to make sacrifices to manage it, sacrifices that could have a long term impact. For example if you graduate university and are offered a dream job that requires you to move 200 miles away and you have no money... it's very difficult to take it: if you have savings then you have something to support you through a cross-country move!

Also I think you underestimate just how expensive adult life is, it's much easier to save when you have no responsibilities than when you have responsibilities, unless you're expecting to walk into a ~Â£40,000 a year job.",0,1412606647,null,0,false,0,cl1w0zp,t3_2ig3wp,t1_cl1w0zp,t3_2ig3wp,null,1426659400,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2

So what? I don't see what relevance this has in the situation in Kill the Moon.  That thing was not a human baby, so there are no human-invented-laws governing what you can and can't do with it, especially when it is not okay to murder it before it hatches. 

&gt;The whole world voted to kill it but as always, Clara made the ""right"" decision and saved it.

That's what makes it an anti-abortion episode, not a pro-choice one.

&gt;It is not a life or death situation for anybody besides the fetus which is not what happened in this episode.

what the fuck? It is sometimes! Sometimes the baby causes complications for the mother and the only recourse she has is to abort.

&gt;This seemed like a clear ""needs of the many vs the needs of the few"" situation.

I don't understand how people are arguing this.  Why can't it be this AND an anti-abortion episode?

Make the spiders pseudo conscious so there's actually a moral qualm about killing all of them with the nukes. Then make the spider webs ""gravity webs"", like normal spider webs, but designed to pull things into them.

In the end, the spider monsters, which could have been cool cause giant spiders = freaky, would be a worthy monster. The only problem being the getting rid of them at the end without blowing them up. As to that ... iono ... fuck it, if they're willing to go 'giant moon egg baby' on us why not just say the mass of spider gravity webbing is them building cocoons to turn into giant space butterflies and flutter away. They could go chill with all the space bees from Series 4.

Seriously, do people not understand that episodes are written as social commentary, character studies, or moral dilemmas more than they are written to be scientific or melodramas? The point is to examine the conflict in an individual episode and what it says about the human condition. To give an example, the lack of extra shuttles for space exploration isn't an oversight by the writer; it's a way of expressing the worst outcome of our collective apathy towards space exploration in our current age.
