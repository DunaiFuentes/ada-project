&gt; “I do not believe in neutrality,” the professor said. “All of my lectures stress that claims towards neutrality and impartiality and objectivity are bogus.”

I do think there's something to be said about when we believe the victim indiscriminately and when to take into account political motivations but this article does a poor job of that. I also think the reason it's being accepted at face value is in part due to the increasing admissions of guilt coming form Adams and the sad history of some Catholic Church members making it easier for us to accept these stories. Also, you know, it's the IRA and even if you're staunchly pro-IRA you have to admit people who carry out the sorts of things they did won't all be good people and would easily be capable of this.

false,JunglistMassive,,GLORIOUS RED SAUCE ARMY,"The article you linked to is itself disingenous given that Stephen Glover takes a broadswipe at Roy Greenslade for attacking the journalist Henry McDonald, with out mentioning the fact that Henry McDonald, himself was a a former member of [Sinn Fein The workers Party/OIRA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_McDonald_%28writer%29), but that is entirely beside the point.

What we have seen in the past month is an unprecedented level of media coverage over a case that was abandoned in the courts. I don't doubt Mairia, nor do i think the IRA where in any way capable of dealing with the issue by investigating it themselves.

But this has clearly become a media circus, the topic is a political football, in which no one seems to be concerned with the truth, but causing as much damage as possible. Every effort has been made to de-contextualise the case. An issue that Roy Greenslade, rightfully points out, regardless of his political affiliation. 

To suggest that this type of abuse is unique to Republicans is absolutely absurd, i think at this stage it is safe to say that it plagues all parts of society. There are multiple and seemingly never ending revelations about abuse and cover-ups, they emanate from all parts of this divided society, and it is certainly not unique to this island. Scandals include the Multiple celebrities and staff at the BBC, Kincora, the Cahill case, Liam Adams, The Catholic Church, Rochdale, Westminister. 

Compare the Cahill case to the scant coverage of of the ongoing scandal of Kincora, or the coverage of Adams compared to [Paisleys Knowledge of Kincora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDgqafJU1CY). [MI5 played a massive role](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-28597343) in the cover up of Kincora, but any revelations barely last a 24hr news cycle. Even now the Investigation is being [hampered](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/debateni/blogs/kincora-boys-home-inquiry-is-a-betrayal-of-the-abused-30694331.html).

false,L41r,null,null,"&gt; I would like an alien male (alien female a close second or even an androgynous one) not unlike Turlough. Someone who has their own reasons for traveling with the Doctor beyond just adventuring. They don't have to be trying to kill the Doctor or anything like that, but I would like them to have a simple secret to them. Maybe they are on the run from some kind of temporal police or maybe they are trying to secretly get the Doctor to change time for them.

So, basically C'rizz?

&gt;If not that I would like a human or alien male like Jamie. He and the Doctor become BFFs and just jump from planet to planet.
If not that I would like Ian Chesterton or Evelyn Smythe, someone who both contrasts the Doctor and supports him. Someone who isn't going to take his shit or can take it in stride and dish back something gold.

Either of those would be awesome. The thing I love about Evelyn is the mellowing effect she had on Six as a result of her being equally as snarky and not afraid to call him out on things, and I'd love to see a similar character arc with 12.

I did actually say in my original post that there is a need to look into political motivations in this case which you seem to have overlooked but this particular article does an awful job at that as it is so concerned with defending Sinn Fein and the IRA it comes off like it's attacking Mairia more than questioning the media due to Greenslades political affiliation. Which is vile in my opinion as like you I believe her story. Furthermore not declaring that political affiliation in an article attacking others for much the same is laughable and ruins any credibility this shoddy article would have had.

I in no way said this abuse was unique to republicans, I have no idea how you could have come to that conclusion other than the fact I only used examples of abuse that took place in the republic where this case is occurring. 

I agree that what happened in Kincora was disgraceful and needs to be investigated, however I question why you would mention it here and frankly anytime Mairia's case is brought up in this subreddit. No-one disagrees that the handling of this was wrong but it's not really relevant as it is two separate organisations on the opposite side of the war. Which does draw an interesting parallel but constantly bringing it up is a poor attempt to distract from this case.

- Trojan horse plot involving hundreds of governors and teachers, to take over British schools and indoctrinate our children with Islamist propaganda

- The targeting of thousands of white, as well as Sikh children by Kashmiri Muslim rape gangs over the past 16 years, and the subsequent coverup by the Labour council and local police service. This is a problem to do with Islam because the countries where these people come from, child marriage (aka rape) is a cultural norm, as they are simply following the actions of their prophet, who himself married a 6 year old girl called Aisha and had sex with her when she was 9. Further, they target non-muslim children because they consider them ""kuffars"".

- Cultural cohesion problems. Many of these muslims come from extremely corrupt and primitive parts of the world such as tribal Bangladesh, where voter intimidation and strong arm tactics are the norm. We are seeing this in Tower Hamlets where Lutfur Rahman and his goons intimidate voters at the polling stations and consistently break/bend the law by handing out illegal leaflets.

- Hundreds of British born muslims who have flown off to Syria and Iraq to partake in **beheadings, crucifixions, gang rape, human trafficking for the purposes of sex slavery, as well as targeted genocide**.

- The views of muslims concerning homosexual rights, women's rights and freedom of expression. It is the [MAJORITY view across the muslim world that gays should be subjugated](http://www.pewglobal.org/2013/06/04/the-global-divide-on-homosexuality/). It is also the majority view that criticism of Islam should be a crime, as is the case in almost every muslim country.

These are problems to do with Islam and muslims specifically. We aren't seeing hindus or sikhs doing this are we? Every religion has their extremists but it seems to me that muslim extremism is the biggest problem right now in that regard. Please don't bring up past Christian atrocities, as we are talking about the present day

&gt;__In vitro meat__, also called __cultured meat__, __tubesteak__, __cruelty-free meat__, __shmeat__, and __test-tube meat__, is an animal-flesh product that has never been part of a living animal with exception of the [fetal calf serum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_calf_serum) taken from a slaughtered cow. In the 21st century, several research projects have worked on *in vitro* meat in the laboratory.  The first in vitro beefburger, created by a Dutch team, was eaten at a demonstration for the press in London in August 2013.  There remain difficulties to be overcome before *in vitro* meat becomes commercially available.  Cultured meat is prohibitively expensive, but it is expected that the cost could be reduced to compete with that of conventionally obtained meat as technology improves.   *In vitro* meat is also an ethical issue. Some argue that it is less objectionable than traditionally obtained meat because it doesn't involve killing and reduces the risk of animal cruelty, while others disagree with eating meat that has not developed naturally.

Alright, I have to step in here- this is overdoing it a touch. People from any side of the spectrum are entitled to a proper discussion here- a passive-aggressive routine like this is kind of out of kilter with what we set up this place to shoot for in the first place.

I do like your posts, generally- but do try and keep to acceptable limits in future?

Into The Dalek: I've forgotten most of this episode - very interesting concept but unforgettable

Robot Of Sherwood: -_- 

Listen: Probably one of my favourite episodes. It had good pacing, good tension, in-episode time travel, and a the inception-style post episode mystery.

Time Heist: Another great episode, I'm a big fan of BBC's Hustle - and this felt like that but with sci-fi and time travel. The monster could have been better, but it was paced well and executed brilliantly.

The Caretaker: Earth based, local, close to home, other than the fact that the alien could have had a little more budget spent on it, I thought the story was good, Capaldi's distain for soliders I thought was justifyed and I'm glad it was addressed considering Pink is a solider.

Kill The Moon: Eh, it was ok...no fantastic, but ok. The Doctor actually leaving Clara to her own devices - really grew Clara as a character.

Mummy On The Orient Express: I actually watched this ON A TRAIN...so that was a good start, I thought it was fantastic. Again, paced well and executed brilliantly. Gus was a fantastic enemy. The ending was a little week - it had a jump cut end...Empending Doom - EVEYRONE LIVES.

Flatline: Local, Very Local. Still not sure why they didn't actually shoot IN Bristol. Plot was good, Spx was good, and need I say more about the Adams Family TARDIS (also A113!)

In the Forest of the Night: Can I first point out that most, if not all of this episode took place during the day? Did anyone else pick up on that?! Secondly WEAK, and I hate child actors.

I'm really excited for this Missy story to be explained. It really has had been guessing which is a first for a story arc.

Before the pitchforks are lit – it’s worth learning to take these things with a pinch of salt and read between the lines. 

They’re not looking for a computer illiterate person who would struggle with basic admin and office tasks. They don’t want gardeners or labourers who don’t know their way around a computer. They don’t want people who are rubbish on the phone. 

So if you’re applying straight out of school and don’t have any experience, you’re probably not going to get this one. They have to set the yardstick somewhere. That’s *all*. 

Oh – and some friendly advice for anyone who gets indignant at job specs that have a long list of skills or ask for 3 years’ experience for a graduate position – read between the lines. They want someone with some experience and it could be academic, not someone who somehow magically has 3 years professional experience straight out of University.

So while I may sound heartless I did not think that it was right that these two idiots I was with were taking up two beds in this unit because they chose to take these drugs. The result of their actions was that they could not breath unaided and so were in that unit for quite some time where they were trying to get them breathing unaided again. 

Yeah everyone has a right to life and everything was done to keep these morons alive and so it should. They were fine after a few hours. But they should pay some sort of price for what they did, taking up all that time and all of those resources because of their decision. However they won't be punished for their behaviour or face a charge of any sort and will in reality be back again and again until they either get their shit together or die.

I don't have a solution, I just think that drug abuse is horrendous and the result of it impacts far more people than just the user and their family. Over time i've lost a lot of sympathy for addicts and don't have any hesitation arresting them for possession at any opportunity.

What about holiday entitlements (market distorting legislation) and maternity leave (market distorting legislation) where the employer loses valuable days and still has to pay the absent employee?

These are not 'dreams' this is the real world - you're the one with the libertarian wet-dreams, not me.

&gt; Why should my friend who is a cleaner for A, earn more than me, just because I'm a cleaner for B?

Are you serious?! If you've been employed long enough or even glanced through some job ads and been to some interviews you'd know that is the way the world actually works! For example:

Company A - with a £billion turnover pays £60k for a product sme.
Company B - with a £million turnover pays £45k for the same sme.
Company C - with a £100k turnover pays £30k for the same sme.

However when it comes to cleaners:

Company A - with a £billion turnover pays £12k for a cleaner.
Company B - with a £million turnover pays £12k for the same cleaner.
Company C - with a £100k turnover pays £12k for the same cleaner.

Why shouldn't cleaners (or other labourers) be subject to the same market conditions as other workers?

&gt; I was really addressing you saying that the cleaner has a right to a living wage. I'm just saying they don't, neither do I, neither do you.

What right do we have to anything in this world? What right do we have to pick up a phone, dial 999 and have access to emergency services without a payable service contract? What right do you have to use pavements or roads? Assuming you've got a job, what right do you have to holiday pay, or sick leave, or pension?

false,Number-6,eng-hertfordshire,Hertfordshire,"People sometimes say all political parties are the same. Today the contrast between the Conservatives and Labour could not be more clear. One party is reforming welfare and limiting entitlements, the other wants to turn the welfare taps back on. We want brilliant new schools set up in the state sector, Labour has set its face against them because its friends in the unions don't like it. Conservatives celebrate the workers and entrepreneurs who create jobs - Labour demonises them and would make life more difficult for British businesses.

And nowhere is the contrast more stark than on taxation. Labour wants to put up taxes on people's homes, jobs, pensions - even their deaths. Conservatives are committed to cutting your taxes.
We know the economic case for cutting taxes: in a competitive world we cannot afford to carry on as a bloated, high-taxing, welfare-heavy nation. We have to direct our resources to incentivising work through tax cuts and not incentivising welfare through extra benefit entitlements. We have to fight the notion that you can endlessly suck more taxes out of businesses and bite the hand that feeds.

Conservatives understand the progressive case for tax cuts too. Historically there have been all sorts of mechanisms that governments have developed to help people to enjoy a higher standard of living, from fixed prices to complicated benefit schemes.

For me, the simplest way to help with living standards is this: allow people to take home more of their own money. Put another way, which makes more sense: tax people's incomes heavily and then give them back some of that money in a complicated package of overlapping tax credits or benefits - often creating perverse incentives, meaning that even if people work more, they earn less? Or simply tax them less in the first place?

But quite apart from the economic and progressive cases for cutting taxes, there's the moral case. It is morally right that the rich pay their fair share in tax; and right that those who are able to contribute to our public services and safety nets do so.

But what is morally wrong is government spending money as if it grows on trees. Every single pound of public money started as private earning. Every million in the Treasury represents a huge amount of hard work: early morning alarms, long commutes, hours spent on the factory floor, the office, the hospital ward or the classroom.

Conservatives understand this basic point. Labour doesn't. Ed Miliband once memorably described tax cuts as akin to government “writing people cheques”; in his world, public money is for the minister to bestow magnanimously on the people. And when you start with that attitude, you end up with appalling government profligacy; billions wasted; a growing public leviathan that demands ever higher taxes from working people.

No one should doubt my position: with every spending commitment we must be mindful of who picks up the bill. It's easy for governments to trumpet what they spend money on - and claim a moral victory for it - but on the other side of the coin are those who work hard, many on low incomes, who would desperately like to spend more money on their family. The government has a moral duty to think of these people in any decisions made on tax and spending.

It's for all these reasons that over four and a half years, while reducing the deficit, we have also cut income taxes. We have taken three million people out of income tax altogether and cut the taxes of 26 million.
In the next parliament, we will go further. We have made two clear commitments. First, we will raise the tax threshold again, so that nobody earning less than £12,500 will pay income tax. This represents the most progressive, poverty-attacking tax change in the postwar era: it will mean one million more low-paid workers will not have to pay income tax at all; and it means most basic-rate taxpayers will pay £3,800 less in tax over the next parliament compared with the Labour plans we inherited.

Second, no one earning less than £50,000 will pay the 40p rate of tax. This is about recognising the millions of people who have worked so hard to lift Britain out of recession, bearing a large burden of tax with quiet stoicism. Conservatives don't just talk about being on your side, we demonstrate it - and collectively these commitments will benefit 30 million taxpayers across our country.

Financing these tax cuts while continuing to cut the deficit will be hard, but doable. In this parliament we will have made £100 billion of savings while cutting income tax by £10.5 billion. In the next parliament we plan to make £25 billion of savings while making £7.2 billion in income tax cuts.

And of this I am in no doubt: Labour could not deliver any of this. Forget, for a moment, its complete lack of economic credibility; put aside the fact that it only ever proposes tax rises - on your home, on your business, on your pension. Just think of its beliefs. This is a party ideologically addicted to spending and borrowing and taxing.
And this, for me, goes to the heart of the choice for May 2015. On one side, a Labour party offering more spending, more borrowing, more debt, more taxes to be squeezed out of every working person in our country. On the other side, the Conservatives offering a long-term plan that is working; tax cuts that are credible; a future that is more secure for you and your family. The choice could not be more stark.

&gt;*Report, together with the formal minutes relating to the report Ordered by the House of Commons to be printed 20 October 2014*

And here's the summary for comparison:-

&gt;**Summary**

&gt;*The Home Office (the Department) acquired direct responsibility for the significant problems faced by the UK Border Agency (the Agency) when it was abolished in March 2013 and its functions were transferred to the Department. While performance in most of the areas transferred has held steady, the Department has failed to deal with long standing backlogs of asylum claims. Many older asylum claims—some over seven years old—remain undecided, while a new backlog of cases awaiting initial decision is forming. This is partly as a result of a botched attempt by the Agency to downgrade staff that resulted in 120 experienced caseworkers leaving. The Department lacks the data it needs to manage its backlogs and the overall workload effectively. The failure of a number of IT projects has also compromised the Department’s ability to track people through the immigration system and ensure that those with no right to remain are removed from the UK.*

1. The fact that they haven't done anything - Greens and Labour have failed and have shown themselves to be utterly incompetent and leaderless. We have just been through a recession which historically results in shifts further right and further left amongst the electorate. The Greens did not put their message forward in an appealing way, they garnered no protest votes or apathy votes, and now UKIP have hoovered up all of them. A recession, where a Tory government presided over huge cuts to public services and the armed forces where many well known chains went bust is quite honestly the biggest blessing the left could have hoped for. How much of a target do they need? Rich Bullingdon government, cuts to services that effect poor the most, and whats even more significant is that the Greens are a purely oppositional party!! Unlike Labour, they don't have to worry about what happens in four years when they may have to pick up the pieces, and hear the echoes of their criticisms. The Greens can afford to present themselves in an honest principled way because they don't have to deal with the reality of political pragmatism. They should have had everyone up and down the country stamping their feet for the governments resignation, but they didn't. And that speaks volumes for their leadership, their drive, and their ability. They should be seeing the surge that saw the Lib Dems do well last time, but they did not. They are polling a miserable and spread out 7%, and have to now rely on whining about the BBC and its outrageous desire to be objective and balanced to compensate for their own continuing weakness and stupidity. 

2. The fact that they still aren't doing anything. UKIP are in the news all the time because they are newsworthy, whether for good or bad. The Greens only get in when their leaders get arrested at protests for being anti-science tossers. What have the Greens done that deserves news attention? What have they done that is a talking point? They complain all the time, but so does everyone and we've heard all their points before so it isn't exactly a talking point. What things have they done to attract attention to themselves? I've seen most people defending the Greens by talking of UKIPs media presence as something that started being orchestrated by the media rather than by UKIP - this is bollocks. The ball maybe rolling under its own steam with no effort from UKIP now, but they did an extraordinary job of attracting attention. Their leader worked on his image and is now seen by many to be very charismatic, very different, very normal and endearing to most sections of society for different reasons. The Greens have an annoying twat hippy who a) no one knows the name of, and b) might appeal to a minor subsection of the middle class but that is it. Even if she was competent she would have basically no support. The Greens need to sort out their leadership, get a solid working image of an educated/working unity going based on real moral principles that appeal to common sense, and get some fucking presence. They haven't done this, they have done fuck all, and they frankly deserve as much of the BBC's time as the biscuit rotting under my sofa.

What a ridiculous thing to say. Oh, breaking the law is illegal is it? Well then, let's let in a load of serial rapists and paedophiles. If they break the law, we'll just prosecute them!

What a facile argument. We are talking about prevention here, not about prosecution. Yes, if people break the law and are caught they will be prosecuted, but that doesn't mean we should be relaxed about groups that have certain beliefs that may make them more likely to break specific laws than others.

&gt;Can you imagine if your opinion of the UK was based on 80s BBC presenters extremist groups like Britain First?

The difference is that Islamic extremism, in the current world in which we live, is WAY worse. Britain First are a bunch of ex-EDL football hooligan goons that go around trying to intimidate people. I don't condone what they do and I think that they have among their ranks genuine racists and criminals. 

That being said, they are NOWHERE near as bad as ISIS, and the hundreds of young Brits who have gone overseas to commit gang rapes, beheadings and genocide.

This is why I brought up the issue of Sikhs and Hindus. There are actually extremist Hindu groups out there, that kill people. However, they are not present in Britain. Why are you so eager to avoid this point? 

Please don't go out of your way to find examples of Hindu or Sikh or Christian extremism, as my point is about frequency and present danger.

&gt;Perhaps we should deport all the British misogynists and homophobes too?

Again, we are talking about prevention. We can't deport people that were born here, it is against international law. It is outside of our control. However, stopping people from entering the country is something that we could feasibly control, and do in many cases. What are you really saying here.. that because there are British misogynists, we should let in foreign ones, to be fair?

Another point you are ignoring is the question of how frequent these beliefs are across cultures. I know that left wing types like to paint the West to be the dominant force of evil in the world, but in reality, the West is by far the most tolerant place on Earth. This isn't just talk, it is proven. In every recent poll, countries such as the UK, Germany, Sweden, Italy, France score the highest for women's rights, gay rights, liberty, etc etc.

Yes there are homophobes and misogynists in Britain, but **they are the minority view here, whereas in practically every single muslim country on the planet, they are the majority**. That is the point that I'm trying to drive home to you.

I really hope that people like yourself that are so quick to make excuses, wake up before it is too late. While you are here talking about ""lol, well we have laws for a reason! may as well not bother about the rise of extremism, as we can just prosecute extremists, derp!"".. there are segregated communities in our country breeding violent mad men by the thousands.

 What are you going to say if these young lunatics, instead of deciding to fly to Syria to join ISIS, decide to wreak havoc on our streets? Are you so arrogant to insist that that couldn't happen? That the 500 people who have flown overseas to commit murder and rape, wouldn't conceivably decide to do so on our streets? Get real. This is a very serious problem to do with ONE religion and culture in particular, and no amount of handwashing or denial of the problem is going to change that.

false,Benjji22212,eng-warwickshire,Warwickshire,"In Britain, harsher sentencing under the Dangerous Drugs Act between 1928 and 1967 kept the number of cannabis arrests to fewer than 1,000 each year. After the effective decriminalisation of cannabis from 1967-1974 arrests rose sharply. The introduction of the 'cannabis warning' by the police in 2002 as a way for them to let people arrested for canal is possession off with nothing saw further increases in the number of arrests, which has only stabalised at 150,000-200,00 in the past few years. Full details on arrests [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/116649/rec-crime-1898-2002.xls).

In Portugal, drug use has risen since decriminalisation. The myth that is hasn't is often twisted to appear factual by using the phrases 'no substantial increase' or 'no significant decrease'. See the [World Drugs Report 2009](http://www.unodc.org/documents/wdr/WDR_2009/WDR2009_eng_web.pdf)

In contrast, in countries like Singapore and Japan which do use harsher sentencing, drug use is extremely low in comparison. The number of cannabis arrests in Singapore in the first half of 2013 was [1,893](http://www.cnb.gov.sg/drugsituationreport/drugsituationreport1H2013_1.aspx) - about 0.035% of the population. Extrapolate that for the whole year and the number of cannabis arrests is 0.07% of Singapore's population. The equivalent figure for 2009 in Britain would be 0.25% - over three times greater.

What about holiday entitlements (market distorting legislation) and maternity leave (market distorting legislation) where the employer loses valuable days and still has to pay the absent employee? Or sick pay (market distorting legislation)?

So I was saying market distorting legislation causes water to flow round the obstacle.  On minimum wage legislation we can see this with bullshit apprenticeships, and bullshit 'self employed' setups where what would have been called the 'employee' now 'works for themselves'.  You can also see zero hours contracts becoming more popular as a pushback against it.

On equal pay/maternity leave you get women who are not employed or are passed over for promotion because they are of child-bearing age, because the employer does not want to pay for maternity leave.

On holiday entitlements and sick pay you have zero hours contracts and 'self employment'.

So there are some examples of 'water flowing round the obstacle'.

&gt; Why shouldn't cleaners (or other labourers) be subject to the same market conditions as other workers?

They are.  Right now.  The difference between higher paid, more variably paid roles, is the potential for increased value.  No matter how good your cleaner is, and how sparkling your environment, their value is relatively static.  That is the same market conditions as other workers.  The difference in pay for other roles isn't simply a function of company turnover, as someone keen to educate in the ways of the real world, you will know this.

&gt; What right do we have to anything in this world? What right do we have to pick up a phone, dial 999 and have access to emergency services without a payable service contract? What right do you have to use pavements or roads? Assuming you've got a job, what right do you have to holiday pay, or sick leave, or pension?

&gt; You're going to tell me you pay your taxes... well the odd thing here is that people on minimum wage pay taxes too, and if they were paid more (on a grade with the company they work for) then they'd pay more tax...

What right do we have to anything in this world?  All the rights in the world won't do you any good if nobody is going to provide you a means to exercise them. 

Yes, people pay more tax if they get more money.  This I'm not disputing.

-Parents who were driven to succeed in life pay for private schools as they see it as an investment in their children, which they expect more out of and push to get better grades and more extra curricular.


-Class sizes are lower in Private Schools so each student gets more development on their skills with teachers.

Hey look, another attack on my character instead of any attempt at a valid defence of your ideology. I've been part of the underclass. I've been homeless, and I've had to live off of welfare before. I find the support for UKIP to be the same kind of support groups like Britain first, BNP and whatever name 'racist but not really racist' groups call themselves now a days.

I think the Guardian is a load of pish as well thank you very much.

People find UKIP's policy appealing because it gives them something to blame that isnt the upper class and is in front of them every single day in the headlines and in the media. ""Immigration is killing the UK!""


No mate, companies not paying any tax is killing the UK, the ever increasing price of rent is as well. The movement away from what made the UK decent to begin with, Socialism and toward capitalism with no taxation and no representation, completely unchecked. Look at rent prices in the London, look at it in the UK as a overall whole.


UKIP is doing  fucking nothing to address the real problems the UK is facing, they're just echoing the ones Murdoch has been pumping out through tabloids.



Also il give you a little spoiler;

My ideological thinking falls way more to the right than the left.

Even worse is that one of our major exports has been since the 1950's, nuclear power related parts and machinery. How criminal is it to let that market slide without proper governmental backing?

Now they're all about the windmills. Expensive, uneconomical, unable to store the power they produce, when they do work. Useless if the wind isn't blowing or demand is low.

Anyway my point is, UKIP's energy draft policy summary:

UKIP supports a diverse energy market including coal, nuclear, shale gas, geo-thermal, tidal, solar, conventional gas and oil. Encourage the re-development of British power stations, as well as industrial units providing on-site power generation. Community Improvement Levy money from the development of shale gas fields. Abolish green taxes and charges in order to reduce fuel bills.

I agree with all this. The rest of the policy is basically the scrapping of all subsidies and building a stable power supply for Britain across various practical means.

It looks to me that UKIP have a more open and practical approach to the matter. They mention various sources of power and the 'Encourage the re-development of British power stations'. It sounds like a good approach to meeting our future power needs, without financially crippling the poor and causing more people to die to do it.

The night life etc, will not compare with a proper city (Manchester etc), but there's certainly plenty of pubs and one or two clubs. It's a big student population so that means there'll be plenty of like minded people to pal along with.

----

It looks a bit more complicated than yours, but I've spent the better part of this year testing and trialing things out. I'll explain my process!


*Cleansing*.

Oil Cleansing and finding a gentle pH 5.5 cleanser (out skin is slightly acidic, so it's best to use a cleanser that's around that range) has greatly helped me cut down my oil. I tried baby oil too and it broke me out. I think it's because I didn't fully take it off, and my skin didn't love that. Either way, when I bought a prepackaged oil cleanser with an emulsifier my skin really responded to oil cleansing. It is the easiest and most gentle way to take off makeup. 

Do you use the clarisonic every day? It might be too harsh, especially with acne. You could try a konjac sponge, it's a lot more gentle but you still get the same exfoliating effect. [Superdrug sells them](http://www.superdrug.com/Superdrug/Superdrug-Pebbles-Konjac-Sponge/p/621570#.VFIf8_msW3A).

*Exfoliating*.

I started with a BHA, then added the Nip+Fab pads that you use, but they weren't strong enough so when /u/xerane kindly offered me the Mizon I jumped at it. My skin really *really* likes glycolic acid. I just found that the combination of the hydroluronic acid in the Nip+Fab pads were overwhelming my skin a little in the moisture department. The retinol I added on a whim and it is really helping my Closed Comedones go away! 

*Moisturising.*

Day time I use a gel mosturiser always. Always. Our oily skin prefers it I don't feel oily afterwards. I use

The drops of oil in my night time moisturiser help it sink in. Ever since I started I don't wake up with an oily face at all.

-----

**Your next steps!**

Obviously, I'm not saying you should run out and buy everything I use! That would probably overwhelm your skin. But I would start (and I did start) by taking each step of your routine and trying to tweak it. 

I'd start with removing and adding back any products (also try this with your clarisonic) you're using to see if they are working. If they aren't working, make a note of the ingredients, and then cross check to see if there are any similarities. You might have sensitivities to ingredients. That's how I discovered my skin does not love niacinamide. 

The pH of the Cetaphil is reported to be 6.7, making it wayyy too high for you to be using! Eucerin's cleansers are 5.5, there are a few others! Sebamed, La Roche Posay Effaclar Purifying Foaming Gel is too.

Maybe look into an oil cleanser with an emulsifier. Boots has a few, they even do their own brand that isn't too pricey. Johnsons baby oil now have a [fragrance free version](http://www.boots.com/en/Johnsons-Baby-First-Touch-Oil-200ml_1487558/), so you could try again.

Best of luck lovely!

&gt; Maybe that cleaner has a right to a living wage?
Maybe if you enjoy the prestige of having a company and premises that reflect your premium salary - then the cleaners you employ should also share in the benefit they bring to keeping your premises in line with that image.

So my argument all along, was:

a) no they do not have a right to any particular pay rate, as that implies that someone must employ them at that rate, which makes no sense
and

b) it makes no sense to have a cleaner paid more because their employer pays others much more money or is wealthier.

What you haven't addressed is that the value a cleaner provides is relatively static, so making their rates change based on some particulars of how it is run or how it pays others, doesn't really make any sense.  And that market distortion will just add complications.  If a cleaner needs to be paid more they need to provide more value, either by making things cleaner or by cleaning more things.  Like any of us, the more value we provide, the more pay we are likely going to be able to get.

Your face and scalp are not necessarily 'naturally' oily it is simply oily with the products, routine and lifestyle you have at present: there is NOTHING natural about the average UK lifestyle.

I'd agree with the others you may well be overexfoliating and overcleansing, if you are that means anything else you apply can irritate, even tap water or shampoo bubbles in some cases. Irritation does not have to be redness or swelling (that is actually inflammation) but can be excessive sebum production, a little dryness or dullness, the symptoms can be subtle and not be all over your face because some areas of skin are thinner than other parts. That 'dead' skin is actually active tissue and a critical part of your skin barrier.

Try using a super gentle cleanser free of all anionic surfactants (sulphates, olefin sulfonates) and at a pH of around 4.5 to 5.5, NO exfoliation for at least a week, plus a barrier repair type moisturiser such as CeraVe AM and PM (has ceramides, cholesterol and niacinamide all good for the barrier and reducing excess sebum production). Do patch test and introduce these slowly, not all at once. Also consider your dental care products, no drying alcohol in your mouthwash, no sulphates in your toothpaste.

Your problem is with faith schools and regulation concerning religion in schools rather than Islam. I dont state funded free schools teaching creationism either

&gt;This is a problem to do with Islam because the countries where these people come from, child marriage (aka rape) is a cultural norm, as they are simply following the actions of their prophet, who himself married a 6 year old girl called Aisha and had sex with her when she was 9. Further, they target non-muslim children because they consider them ""kuffars"".

This is a problem with Pakistani men not Islam. Probably is a very misogynist culture within men in that community but it isn't directly related to Islam. Most religions are implicitly misogynist anyways. Also, this talking point of Mohammed marrying little girls is bullshit because at that time, in most of the world, girls would be married of at that age anyway. Read the old testament mate.

&gt;Cultural cohesion problems. Many of these muslims come from extremely corrupt and primitive parts of the world such as tribal Bangladesh, where voter intimidation and strong arm tactics are the norm. We are seeing this in Tower Hamlets where Lutfur Rahman and his goons intimidate voters at the polling stations and consistently break/bend the law by handing out illegal leaflets.

One dickhead politician doesn't represent a whole community

&gt;Hundreds of British born muslims who have flown off to Syria and Iraq to partake in beheadings, crucifixions, gang rape, human trafficking for the purposes of sex slavery, as well as targeted genocide.

True

&gt;The views of muslims concerning homosexual rights, women's rights and freedom of expression. It is the MAJORITY view across the muslim world that gays should be subjugated. It is also the majority view that criticism of Islam should be a crime, as is the case in almost every muslim country.

According to that survey the majority of Christian Africa also think homosexuals should be subjugated. Associating religion with these attitude ignores other factors that makes these sentiments prevalent. Sauce the view that the majority of Muslims think that criticizing Islam should be a crime. And even it is is a majority, thats probably in muslims counrties anyway, and if its a majority here, i wouldnt be surprised that people dont want their own religion criticized, no shit Sherlock.

&gt;These are problems to do with Islam and muslims specifically. We aren't seeing hindus or sikhs doing this are we? 

Western Hindus and Sihks probably not, go to India and see the caste system in action you might not agree. Also, theres loads of fucked up shit regarding honor killings and forced marriages that go on behind closed doors, Hindus and Sihks are people and aren't all the perfect model citizens you make them out to be.  

&gt;Please don't bring up past Christian atrocities, as we are talking about the present day

No lets, because you don't get to criticize one religion without criticizing others. Ill point to African countries discriminating against gays and America terrorizing whole swathes of the world with drones

I fully understand your argument - but employees must at least employ cleaners at minimum wage... so I don't see how this makes any difference to a variable minimum wage based on 1/65th of the top employee wage.

I fully agree with you about providing more value as a service, in order to charge more - but isn't this exactly what a 1/65th minimum wage would enforce anyway (just as current minimum wage is enforced)?

A cleaner who cleans a the executive offices of a bank is going to be expected to do a better job than a cleaner who cleans a car garage for example.

In an ideal world - people would be paid for the job they do, but in the real world - the ability to negotiate a contract sometimes comes down to who can hold out the longest. If you're desperate for work and food, then even though you may be worth £20k, you may end up taking £15k because a company can go a bit a longer with a dirty office than you can go without food.

Heck, I have a specialist skill myself which comes at a high price, but some companies just won't offer that price, they'll just wait whilst no-one responds to their job ads, wait 6 months and then try looking for a contractor again. Now whether I accept their low rate comes down to how healthy my finances look in 6 months - if I'm doing well I can tell them to get stuffed, but if work has dried up I might have to take it.

I can afford this, but people on a minimum wage can't - they are literally hand-to-mouth. That is why government regulations exist, in order to protect the little people against the larger entities that would exploit them in their vulnerable position.

I'm not arguing for introducing a minimum wage, because we already have one, I'm arguing for a greater share for those who have helped make a company a success right down to the people who do the thankless jobs.",0,1414671317,null,0,false,0,clo3jca,t3_2knm7p,t1_clo3jca,t1_clo33a4,null,1426276338,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Just to give a quick example, I finished school at 3.30 unless I had detentions, at 3.30 everyday my sister has two hours of compulsory extra curricular activities of her choosing. These include things like code club, duke of Edinburgh awards, high quality sports coaching, art and drama awards, homework help, local volunteering and pretty much any activity that helps make young people more rounded in what ever area they happen to be passionate about. She also gets yearly ski trips and other out of school experiences. Now if she uses all this to get into university and is financially supported, she will likely carry on doing more extra curricular things related to whatever she wants to do giving her a huge advantage over those that struggle with money for the three years they are there and have to work. Furthermore if come summer time she can take unpaid internships/volunteer abroad ect instead of having to work in a supermarket, the gap starts to widen. 

To be honest the biggest difference is that she has a very strong work ethic forced onto her from an early age. When I was at school I never struggled and could get away with doing very little as the classes were big and the content wasn't really challenging, I never did homework and just got lost in the system as one of many under achievers. This isn't really possible for my sister as the individual attention each student gets and the culture the school has of achieving is a good thing means they have a lot more pressure to work hard.

The actual research paper doesn't discriminate between different grad schemes, some which are more competitive than others and pay more within the same occupation and even role.

An example to forward my point would be in medicine (however rather crude because general practice is privatised, same premise though) If you go to a top ranked uni you're more likely to be successful in getting a training post in a competitive speciality at a prestigious trust and progressing through it. General practice is littered with mostly graduates who went to lower ranked uni's and failed to progress in or attain specialised posts. However they are all technically 'doctors'. The same premise I imagine applies to lawyers. I went to Warwick, and my friends who read econ/maths/MORSE, compared to my friends from lower ranked uni's, who are all 'analysts' in finance firms are typically in much more competitive grad schemes within the same firms and so have a higher pay.

This is the actual research paper, if you care to read it: http://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/publications/wps/WP201430.pdf

Indeed, we estimate that around a third of state school students earn more than the median amongst private school students both 6 months and 3.5 years after graduation. It is also interesting to note that the variation in earnings is larger amongst graduates who attended private schools than amongst those amongst those who attended state schools. Moreover, this variation increases over time. This suggests that the premium that appears to arise from attending private school is not automatic: there is more variability in how well graduates from private schools go on to do in the labour market.*

Anecdotal, but the fact that I went to a prestigious private school had no affect on my salary for my grad job (it's fixed), in my specific scheme. I doubt my employer even looked or cared what school I happened to go to, rather my university.

Looking at the rental yield being around £5700 a year and the profit made in selling at around £12.5k I would suggest if your finances permit it keep the flat for a couple of years at least.  If you could hang on it it for three years you would make about £17k but lets say you take off 10% per year for upkeep so roughly £15k (rounding down to be safe).  So you can sell now and make £12.5k or you can wait and make £15k AND still have the option to sell but with a probably at least slightly improved value. 

Personally to me if you can afford to do so I would rent it out and reconsider your position periodically. 

However I am not an expert I have just worked in property for a few years and would yield before others here who probably have greater insight than I.

You're deluded if you think Baker is better than Salah, if we loaned Baker out he would be playing in the Championship. We had to fight Liverpool for Salah and if he was to be loaned out he would be loaned out and starting for a team in one of the top 3 leagues. Salah is a good player who just hasn't had a run in the team and Baker isn't even close to being as good as him, yet. 

Oscar and Cahill was our only two starters on the pitch, you don't want to completely change your starting XI, that's usually how these games get lost and it was a close call. If Baker was going to start it would have been ahead of Ake with Ake being on the bench or at LB considering Luis is pretty much guaranteed for the game against QPR although I think the point is to give Luis a decent run in the team and if he plays well against QPR I can see him starting against Liverpool too. 

He'll only get caught up in an endless cycle of loans if he can't perform. Most of our bright prospects out on loan are moving forward. Chalobah had two successful seasons in the Championship and now is playing a part for Burnley in the Prem, playing in three games out of nine isn't bad considering he's been injured too. Both of Thorgan and Piazon are doing well in the Bundesliga after loans in Belgium and the Netherlands. All three of them are presenting a case for themselves and could all be in the squad next season or the following season, especially if Mikel continues to get little game time and if both Schurrle and Salah continue this poor form.

Research suggests oleic acid is a penetration enhancer, skin barrier disruptor, implicated in seborrhoeic dermatitis and acne. Also a couple of studies suggesting olive oil is detrimental to the skin barrier (comparison was to sunflower oil which does not cause the same issues). For example

*""Oleic acid (OA) is well-known to affect the function of the skin barrier. ...  Results indicate that lower concentrations of OA preferentially mix with and disorder the ceramide-enriched domains, followed by perturbation of the PA-enriched domains and disruption of SC lipid domain separation at higher OA levels.""*

I've had lots of jobs (contracts and fulltime) and I've negotiated many salaries. It's a matter of asking and convincing people that you're worth it. It's not easy and it doesn't come naturally to many people but it can be learned and taught.

The only thing that really keeps him from being a household name to everyone on Earth normally is that he comes and goes so quickly. It takes a lot of communication and time to spread news and information around, and the doctor doesn't sit and talk to the press every time he saves the world. And a lot of times, the people who survive encounters with him are so fundamentally changed by their experiences that they either don't feel like talking or other people stop believing them. 

And also, like the Doctor has said, people just tend to overlook and forget the strange things if it damages their safe little world view. People on the street would just shake their heads and get on with their day after seeing a police box disappear, never really knowing that they just witnessed the doctor.

Both the 66-70 Wilson government and the 70-74 Heath government as well as the police played a role in the process, which started in 1967 when the existing strict cannabis laws defined in the Dangerous Drugs Act 1925 ceased to be enforced properly by the police for reasons unknown, though it probably had something to do with the fact that The Wilson government at the time wished to seriously reform the laws on cannabis. It was in reality a revolutionary time when then radical ideas about marriage, abortion and criminal justice were being implemented with little objection and the acceptance of recreational cannabis use was just another growing cultural trend. They started trying to get a new cannabis bill to replace the DDA passed in 1969, but were defeated unexpectedly in the 1970 General Election by the Conservatives before they could finish the process. However, the Heath government continued to draw up the new drug laws and, though not as revolutionary as they might have been under Labour, they were weaker, focused more on rehabilitation than punishment and introduced a class system of drugs with cannabis in the lowest class (C). The final part of the process was the instruction by the Lord Chancellor, Lord Hailsham, to magistrates in 1974 to stop sending people to prison for simple posession of cannabis. After that, cannabis offenders were generally given the softest consequences available and were never punished for their crime as they had been under the DDA. The police then introduced (without any Parliamentary consent) a no-consequence action called the 'cannabis warning' in 2004, which half of all people who are arrested for cannabis posession now receive.

I actually think that Labour's current approach is a bit of a master stroke. Anyone arguing for full and unqualified nationalisation of the railways will be accused of being an old school ideology-driven socialist. Conservatives et al argue that the private sector is cheaper/more efficient.

The current proposals essentially tell those people to put their money where their mouth is. Let public sector companies bid for franchises on equal terms as private firms; if those private firms really are more efficient, they'll have no problem blowing public sector bids out of the water on merit. And if the public sector bids win, no one can argue that it wasn't deserving.

The best part is, it turns the ideological argument right around; there's no good argument as to why public companies shouldn't be allowed to bid for these franchises on merit, so anyone objecting must be doing so on old school ideological grounds!

Getting rid of the whole expensive and messy franchise system altogether would still have it's merits; but this is a painless and excellent step. If in some hypothetical future DOR is running every franchise, it'll be much easier and cleaner (both practically and politically) to argue that franchising needs to go.

Additionally, the way in which the goalie approached him, the assistant referee was probably shielded from seeing what happened and likely couldn't really help the referee with it and the referee called it on what it looked like from his angle, directly behind the play about 5 yards from the center line. From straight behind this looked much worse than from the better angle which is on the sideline where the camera is positioned (and even better angle from directly opposite where the referee was).

So you're trying to claim we can enforce the law (or I imagine in your opinion, stronger laws, more custodial sentences) more strongly - with less resources. Studies release today show that stronger sentences make no differences to drug use so I don't think your assumption would be accurate.

He came from Serie A, where the sight of a high line is very rare. 

Secondly, he's been quite injury prone since Pellegrini arrived and as such fell down the pecking order. Demichelis was an astute purchase and a far more experienced defender (used to playing high line under MP at Malaga) and he was always going to get in ahead of Nasty. 

Don't get me wrong, Nastasic is an excellent player. But he's been held back by his inability to adapt to our change in defensive tactics and his injury record.

- Blinked them onto my dry finger 4-5 timers after applying moisturiser.

- Cleaned the rubber bit on my curler, which was in a disgusting, gross mess. 

- Discovered that my cheap curler is missing a bit on one side was curling with a lopsided wonk anyway - held it in place during curling.

- Did one hard press for the majority of the lashes and then another for the outer lashes, although it still feels quite tricky and awkward and doesn't feel as though I'm getting them all. 

- Used the [top](http://studiok.strefa.pl/zdjecia/kosmetyki/flutter%20szczotka.jpg) side of the brush shown for the first coat, and especially for the outer corners. Used the other side to separate and add length. 

[Here's the result](http://imgur.com/0QVmp4h). Please excuse the daft pose, the photo was meant for someone else, but I think it shows them pretty well. They're still a little bit straight at the outer edge, but I really think finding the right eyelash curler will resolve that, and they are hugely improved from yesterday's efforts.

I know he has played in both positions, but more often than not he plays in the two.

&gt; Salah is shit ffs so I'm not getting into that.

Salah has been shit for us, but he isn't shit at all and again, he hasn't had a decent run in the team. You have to be damn right ignorant to believe Baker is better than Salah, it's not even close.

&gt; Oscar and Cahill were our only starters? You make it seem like we played a team FULL of youngsters or a team not capable of beating Shrewsbury.

How on earth have you managed to extract that from what I said? The point was that when you have a consistent starting lineup it's ok to make a couple of changes but when you field almost a completely different team the usual Chemistry isn't there.

&gt; It's pretty clear you're talking a load of bollocks about our loanees.

Yeah, it's so clear, I'm just completely chatting shit about the clear progression they're making. Chalobah, still only 19, playing in the Prem, must have no hope. Piazon playing well in the Bundesliga at just 20 years old, clearly another lost hope. Thorgan making a big step up from Belgium to the Bundesliga and again, he's doing great, but he has no chance either.

Chalobah played in 31 games in the Championship last season but yeah you're right he barely played. I then wonder who's bright idea it was to send a player that barely played in the Championship and when he did it was poorly, into the Prem? Yeah he's now at Burnley and has made 3 substitute appearances, baring in mind he joined them on deadline day, 3 games in, and baring in mind he missed a game due to injury. The reality is he's made 3 substitute appearances form 5 available games which isn't bad at all and he's only going to improve as the season progresses.

Thorgan is doing really well and all be it from the bench that's how most loans go for youngsters, they don't just throw them into the team. If he carries on playing the way he is he will be a starter in no time. Piazon has had a couple bad games but for the most part has been good, I'm just going to assume you checked his goals and assists when you made this claim though. Kalas, I didn't even mention Kalas.

See your problem is you're comparing Baker to the likes of Barkley(who is 21 in little over a month, btw), Sterling and Shaw who are all a much higher level than Baker. They all have the potential to be World Class, they all played in smaller squads than Baker and they all played for worse teams, so obviously they're going to get there opportunities sooner. Also, would Sterling have broken into the Liverpool team if it wasn't for the fact that they had an abysmal Steward Downing in his position? Would Shaw have broken out so soon at Manchester United or Chelsea or was it because he was in a newly promoted team? 

Like I said, you're comparing him to players with world class potential who play for worse team and smaller squads, they're obviously going to get their chances sooner.

&gt; And the funny thing is, our best performers against Shrewsbury was our youngsters.

Were we watching different games? I mean, I can't really say any of our youngsters played bad but they never really played good either, they just did their jobs.

So any large organisation has an official agenda. If you're interested in reading the British Legion's official agenda: http://www.britishlegion.org.uk/media/3760854/newroyalcharter.pdf

They'll hold meetings every year where they look to refine these rules, and various people can vote on what they want changed/added/removed. Here's an agenda for this year's meeting:  http://www.britishlegion.org.uk/media/3898446/annconf2014_finalagenda.pdf

As much as the British Legion on the whole will do its best to stick to the principles of its founders who I'm sure had nothing but the best intentions, a large organisation such as theirs will always be swayed by political/financial/internal factors. 

As such, when you give that organisation £1 of your hard earned you have to do so in good faith, because there's no guarantee that money is going to be spent where you think it should be spent. For example, the annual meeting it holds every year? Yeah, that needs to be paid for. Shiny new website? Yep, also needs to be paid for. So a percentage of the money they generate as a charity will always be written off in to expenses. All of that is fine, but those decisions will be made according to their own agenda, and it might not necessarily be in keeping with what you, a person donating to them, would feel comfortable with.

That's what I was getting at when I said they're a massive charity with their own agenda.

Mario went down like a sack of spuds with no visible contact from Jonjo, I actually laughed at how pathetic it was.. Suarez-esque. If I must say.

Mario stayed down clutching his face for well over minute, during this time Liverpool were attacking down the left trying to clinch the winner.

It's not his fault whatsoever that Van Persie scored off the rebound; quite simply, the ball wasn't cleared quick enough and he lost a clean sheet he so deserved.

You can look back at a lot of the games we've played this season and find a similar pattern. He does his job when called upon, and there's not a single, glaring error of his that springs to mind. It simply boils down to the fact that he's exposed more, perhaps due to the fact that the defence is not entirely gelled yet (the goalkeeper's ability to organise his back 4 shouldn't be discounted), or, as I'm inclined to think, because we're just not as good as a defensive unit as we were at times last year.

Thank you for contacting us about the proposed format for the 2015 General Election debates. We have received a wide range of feedback from supporters of different political parties across the UK. In order to use our TV licence fee resources efficiently, this response aims to answer the key concerns, but we apologise in advance if it doesn’t address your specific points in the manner you would prefer.
The BBC is working with other broadcasters to try and make election debates happen in 2015 and we believe we have set out a fair and realistic formula. Twenty two million people saw some of the debates in 2010. They were very successful in engaging the electorate, especially first time voters and the broadcasters would like them to happen again at next year’s general election. We are also putting forward our own proposals for other debates across the UK. 
Ensuring impartiality during an election campaign is a priority and judgements about debates, and other programmes, are taken on the basis of objective editorial assessments of a number of factors, including the levels of past and current electoral support for each party.

Although UKIP did not win a seat in the 2010 general election, they polled more than three times as many votes as the Green Party, which did win a seat. In the 2014 European elections, UKIP topped the poll, beating all the Westminster parties in terms of seats (24) and share of the vote (more than 27% - up more than 10% on 2009). The Greens won three seats in the European election, with just under 8% of the vote (a small drop since 2009). 

UKIP have also performed strongly in local government elections in England for the past two years and have more councillors than the Greens. Before their victory in Clacton, UKIP had come second in every Westminster by-election for the last two years – the Greens’ best performance was around 4%. 

We also take account of opinion polls, when there is a robust and consistent trend: UKIP have been regularly polling in the mid-teens for more than two years, well ahead, for instance, of the Liberal Democrats and around 10 percentage points ahead of the Greens. 
The BBC has since responded to a letter from the Green Party, which expressed disappointment at the proposals unveiled by the UK’s four leading broadcasters for election debates next year. You can read the response in full at:

http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/statements/green-party-letter
In Scotland, the BBC is proposing a debate, in peak time on BBC One, involving the leaders of the SNP, Scottish Labour, the Scottish Conservative and Scottish Liberal Democrat parties. We are proposing a similar format of debate on BBC One from Wales, involving the leaders of Plaid Cymru, Labour, the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats and UKIP. We have written to the parties to begin discussions about our proposals and we will ensure impartiality during the Election in Scotland and Wales. Full details of our content will be released over the coming months once they are finalised.
We hope this goes some way in addressing your concerns, thanks again for taking the time to contact us.

Kind regards

false,HerpesCoatedSmegma,null,null,"This is a huge misconception about private schools, on the whole. Just because you're rich doesn't mean you'll get into a private school, at least a prestigious one. You do get a lot of run of the mill private school's that aren't competitive or really any good, but that's all they are. They're not the high profile one's you're referring to.

For example at mine there were between 3000 and 4000 applications a year, with only 150-160 places or so. Not only do you have to rank in the highest percentage in the entrance exams, but you are assessed in an interview after. You were expected to have a subject of interest, outside of compulsory education, prepared to discuss in the interview. All this at age 10, for example mine was Latin and civilisation in Pompeii.

Not only that, but any stragglers and low achievers are weeded out during the academic years. An E at AS level was classed essentially as a fail by school standards, even though not national. So anyone who got two E's or just one with 3 subjects was not allowed to progress and had to leave the school or sometimes were given the option of having to repeating the year based on circumstance. You also had to get at least A-C in two subjects. ADDE or ADE wasn't sufficient.


I know you haven't mentioned University, but your argument of any 'thick' students, as you call them, goes out of the window and is completely devoid of logic when you consider this. To get into any decent University, you need to get at least AAA or AAB. I'm sure you'll concede that privately educated or not, 'thick' students don't automatically get A grades due to their assumed privileged background.

I think a far more significant factor is the fact that private schools can be selective and are in a better position to nurture excellence.

A school like mine is in the privileged position of being able to accept not only the best students in the country but a great many more from overseas, too. So the only boys getting into the school are extremely talented.

But even then every single class in every single subject is setted by ability. Despite everyone coming in at a high level, for example, there are over ten graded classes in the first year for English alone. That makes a huge difference for teachers.

Coupled with that was an expectation of excellence to which everyone felt subject. It was never clever to be thick.

The importance of facilities can be overstated (when it comes to achievement). I studied for half my A levels in unheated portacabins which were so cold we would sit in them shivering in overcoats and able to see our breath. There were no computers, no interactive whiteboards or any of that—just copying down notes off the board.

false,Benjji22212,eng-warwickshire,Warwickshire," &gt;stronger sentences make no differences to drug use

Firstly, this depends on how well the law is enforced. We have fairly strict sentences for cannabis possession in this country, but they're never used. Secondly, it isn't true when the laws are enforced:

In Britain, harsher sentencing under the Dangerous Drugs Act between 1928 and 1967 kept the number of cannabis arrests to fewer than 1,000 each year. After the effective decriminalisation of cannabis from 1967-1974 arrests rose sharply. The introduction of the 'cannabis warning' by the police in 2004 as a way for them to let people arrested for canal is possession off with nothing saw further increases in the number of arrests, which has only stabalised at 150,000-200,00 in the past few years. Full details on arrests [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/116649/rec-crime-1898-2002.xls).

In Portugal, drug use has risen since decriminalisation. The myth that is hasn't is often twisted to appear factual by using the phrases 'no substantial increase' or 'no significant decrease'. See the [World Drugs Report 2009](http://www.unodc.org/documents/wdr/WDR_2009/WDR2009_eng_web.pdf)

In contrast, in countries like Singapore and Japan which do use harsher sentencing, drug use is extremely low in comparison. The number of cannabis arrests in Singapore in the first half of 2013 was [1,893](http://www.cnb.gov.sg/drugsituationreport/drugsituationreport1H2013_1.aspx) - about 0.035% of the population. Extrapolate that for the whole year and the number of cannabis arrests is 0.07% of Singapore's population. The equivalent figure for 2009 in Britain would be 0.25% - over three times greater. In Japan the figure is approximately 0.0016.%. 

 &gt;why you decide to punish one thing more strongly while something even more harmful is legal.

Because factors other than harm should affect the legality of a substance. One of them is the practicality of banning it. Alcohol is **harmful** but **impractical to ban** so it should be legal. Cannabis is **harmful** and **practical to ban** so it should be illegal.

 &gt;mainstream scientific opinion is on my side on this issue....

The post is a collection of valid investigations, many of which have not been replicated since they were carried out. There's plenty of evidence there which isn't promoted because it isn't popular. Studies which are promoted are the ones which appear to verify the fashionable position on cannabis, which is why so many people mistakenly believe that scientific fact (mainstream opinion is often wrong) is on your side. Dismissing evidence because it contradicts your position is a bad habit to get into.

&gt;The only Scottish Labour MPs who would survive would be Willie Bain in Glasgow North East, Tom Clarke in Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill, Gordon Brown in Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath and Ian Davidson in Glasgow South West.

&gt;The Liberal Democrats would lose all but one of their seats, with only Scottish secretary Alistair Carmichael surviving and high-profile victims including Danny Alexander and Charles Kennedy.

&gt;In comparison, the SNP would go from having six seats at Westminster to 54.

false,domalino,logo,,"I think the reason for our recent malaise is really simple. The team is too settled, and the players have lost their motivations. 

 I think the only two players who have really stood out as playing well are Milner and Hart - Milner is desperate for a place in the first team when Nasri returns, and Hart has got genuine competition.

I think Negredo leaving has made Dzeko a bit lazy, and we are seeing him return to his old, inconsistent ways. He no longer has to play a blinder to keep his place in the team for the next game. Jovetic looks good but not match sharp. By my count he's started something like 3 games? If he had played more he would have buried some of his chances yesterday.

Fernandinho arrived last year desperate to get into the Brazil team. He played like it was his last chance every single week and then he got there. Now he's come back after a massive disappointment, and he's still playing OK, just not out of his skin. This has exposed Yaya's form, which has also dropped considerably, I'd be willing to let it go on account of his brother, but we should have a player who force him out of the team when he plays this poorly.

On top of that kind of player specific loss of motivation - I think in general the whole squad have lost some major driving forces. New manager and new players always means players buckle down to prove themselves to the new regime, and they were also hugely pissed off by  the way we defended the league in 2012/12, not to mention all of the players had disappointment in the World Cup.

We need to bring in a couple of players who are young and either better, or as good as players in the first XI. Not support players, but people who are going to make the others scared for their place. It sounds a bit sociopathic, but comfortable players get lazy. If you create little (friendly) battles in the squad, like Negredo/Dzeko last year, everyone else feeds off the energy and drive those players bring. Last night the only person who seemed to be trying to earn a spot in the derby was Jovetic, and its not really a surprise that most of our play ran through him.

TL;DR We lack internal competition.

Really? absurd is it? Why exactly? It didn't seem too absurd to *professor* David Nutt.

&gt;In any case, the legality of a harmful substance is not an argument for legalising another harmful substance, however less harmful that substance might be than the first. It makes no sense to say ""we have dangerous substances A and B, so we should therefore have C.""

Well firstly I disagree with you categorising everything as a dangerous substance, for example using your logic I could make  case for banning nuts because 1% of people are allergic and they might well die if they come into contact with them. therefore we should ban everyone from having nuts.

Secondly, it does make sense, if activity A is more dangerous than activity B then there certainly there is a case for saying, why is one illegal and not the other.

The reality is that it comes down to money, a state school can't afford to have every student doing two hours of expensive extra curricular activities and awards everyday for five years, so would never make it compulsory and therefore has to find ways of only having some people partake or cut back entirely on what they can offer.

Our problems lie in other areas such as that we lack aggression and genuine pace to in the attacking players to really stretch back lines out. A player such as Mane (who we passed on for God knows why), or Konoplyanka (who could be available for cheap in January), would be inverted but have the aggressive dribbling to run at defenders, cause chaos, but also still get to the byline for a good cross.

Then one of them would probably do the same, and you'd follow them.

This is highly unlikely for anything bigger than a four-seat GA plane though, since almost all larger aircraft have multiple redundant radios. More likely is what apparently happened here, where pilot error (not switching airspaces and frequencies at the right point, and so effectively not listening to ATC) causes a plane to go out of contact, and this is relatively easily resolved when you go ""shit there are jets outside the window"" and re-tune, and/or when you hear the jets radio you on the emergency frequency, which will (normally) always be receiving if your radio is operating at all. 

That said, if their orders were really ""if they don't respond immediately, shoot them down"", that's a very dangerous over-escalation; normally an unresponsive aircraft would be radioed, then escort jets dispatched and radio on the emergency channel, then they'd try to establish visual contact and signals, then they'd fire a warning cannon burst (which is incidentally one of the reasons why modern interceptors still *carry* a cannon) and *then* they would *consider* shooting down the aircraft, or alternatively use wing-over maneuvers to force it to change course without actually shooting it down. These are all things that the RAF is trained to do, and escalating like this is the customary interpretation of international law, which views shooting civil aviation down as one of the few uncontroversially unacceptable things.

The people that know the bailiffs are coming, who've been told by the relevant council department to just ""sit tight, they'll take six weeks, just don't let them in and you'll be fine"" are the ones that get screwed over worst, imo.

The only time on Can't Pay that I've felt the landlord was 100% in the right was last night, when they evicted a family with six children. The mother felt that paying £600 seven months before eviction was good enough, two of the kids appeared to be sleeping on the living room floor, the house was a shit tip, the kitchen was filthy, she was smoking right next to a toddler, and she was completely apathetic.

By excluding homosexuals from marriage entirely, and denying them the choice of whether they can get marriage or not that is a discrimination that implies they are less than those that are heterosexual.  Civil partnership just sounds like a reluctant give in to a request to try and appease people.  If it really is the same, why not just call it marriage.

Especially so for Christian homosexuals, already having to grow up with the battle of understanding their sexuality that is exacerbated by the fact their religion and the state doesn't see them as equal enough to be allowed to participate in the same ceremonies.

Hetro-couples that choose not to have a religious ceremony, but rather get married in a register office are still ""married"".  Why not the same for same-sex couples?

This is all academic anyone seeing as we now how same sex marriage in the UK.  It's just his remarks which are damaging.",0,1414686681,null,0,false,0,cloakqx,t3_2ksidu,t1_cloakqx,t1_clo9yaj,null,1426272996,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Don't worry guys, as an average resident of Boston, I can tell you all.

An article once written by Peter Hitchens on the town really does some up my views:

&gt;""WAS this Britain? Every group of people I passed was speaking Russian.

&gt;The shops were full of black bread, pickled cucumbers and vodka, the faces were Slavic.

&gt;The advertisements in the windows were in the Cyrillic script I had come to know so well when I lived, many years before, in Moscow.

&gt;Yet here I was in the shadow of a lovely English Gothic church tower, half-way to dear old Skegness, surrounded by fields of English turnips, leeks and sugar beet, under an English heaven.

&gt;This was Boston, which I had first seen three decades ago as a somnolent, slightly shabby place full of market towns and generally nice people, where a kindly traffic warden had found me a parking space, saying: 'We can always find room for a foreigner.'

&gt;In those days, a visitor from London was about as foreign as it got in Boston.

&gt;Now they were talking Portuguese in the pubs, Polish in the cafes, Latvian and Estonian on the buses.

&gt;If I had fallen into the river and called out 'Help!', I couldn't even have been sure that anyone would have understood.

&gt;Somehow this transformation was more of a shock, more disturbing and perplexing, than any of the other migration-driven changes I had seen.

&gt;And that tended to be the attitude of the older residents - not anger, hatred or hostility, we are not like that - but bafflement that such a huge thing could have erupted into their peaceful lives, without anyone warning or asking them.

&gt;We had all got used to London being different, long ago.

&gt;The former mill towns of Yorkshire and Lancashire, with their huge new mosques and veiled women, were a place apart.

&gt;But Boston?

&gt;If it could come here, into Deep England, then it would come to everywhere.

&gt;It really is not much good the Prime Minister turning round now and saying to the people of Boston 'this must stop'.

&gt;Even if anyone believed he can or will do anything, the event has happened.

&gt;The greatest mass migration in our history has taken place.

&gt;The newcomers are lawfully here.

&gt;They have the jobs, live in the houses, use the NHS.

&gt;Their children are in the schools.

&gt;Come to that, they are paying tax.

&gt;Our leaders only had to go to Boston, any time in the past five years, and they would have known.

&gt;But all our leading politicians were afraid of knowing the truth.

&gt;If they knew, they would at least have to pretend to act.

&gt;And the truth was, they liked things as they were.

&gt;And it was at least partly my own fault.

&gt;When I was a Revolutionary Marxist, we were all in favour of as much immigration as possible.

&gt;It wasn't because we liked immigrants, but because we didn't like Britain. We saw immigrants - from anywhere - as allies against the staid, settled, conservative society that our country still was at the end of the Sixties.

&gt;Also, we liked to feel oh, so superior to the bewildered people - usually in the poorest parts of Britain - who found their neighbourhoods suddenly transformed into supposedly 'vibrant communities'.

&gt;If they dared to express the mildest objections, we called them bigots.

&gt;Revolutionary students didn't come from such 'vibrant' areas (we came, as far as I could tell, mostly from Surrey and the nicer parts of London).

&gt;We might live in 'vibrant' places for a few (usually squalid) years, amid unmown lawns and overflowing dustbins.

&gt;But we did so as irresponsible, childless transients - not as homeowners, or as parents of school-age children, or as old people hoping for a bit of serenity at the ends of their lives.

&gt;When we graduated and began to earn serious money, we generally headed for expensive London enclaves and became extremely choosy about where our children went to school, a choice we happily denied the urban poor, the ones we sneered at as 'racists'.

&gt;What did we know, or care, of the great silent revolution which even then was beginning to transform the lives of the British poor? To us, it meant patriotism and tradition could always be derided as 'racist'.

&gt;And it also meant cheap servants for the rich new middle-class, for the first time since 1939, as well as cheap restaurants and - later on - cheap builders and plumbers working off the books.

&gt;It wasn't our wages that were depressed, or our work that was priced out of the market. Immigrants didn't do the sort of jobs we did.

&gt;They were no threat to us.

&gt;The only threat might have come from the aggrieved British people, but we could always stifle their protests by suggesting that they were modern-day fascists.

&gt;I have learned since what a spiteful, self-righteous, snobbish and arrogant person I was (and most of my revolutionary comrades were, too).

&gt;I have seen places that I knew and felt at home in, changed completely in a few short years.

&gt;I have imagined what it might be like to have grown old while stranded in shabby, narrow streets where my neighbours spoke a different language and I gradually found myself becoming a lonely, shaky voiced stranger in a world I once knew, but which no longer knew me.

&gt;I have felt deeply, hopelessly sorry that I did and said nothing in defence of those whose lives were turned upside down, without their ever being asked, and who were warned very clearly that, if they complained, they would be despised outcasts.

&gt;And I have spent a great deal of time in the parts of Britain where the revolutionary unintelligentsia don't go.

&gt;Such people seldom, if ever, visit their own country.

&gt;Their orbits are in fashionable London zones, and holiday destinations.

&gt;They are better acquainted with the Apennines of Italy than with the Pennines of their own country.

&gt;But, unlike me, most of the Sixties generation still hold the views I used to hold and - with the recent, honourable exception of David Goodhart, the Left-wing journalist turned Think Tank boss who recognises he was wrong - they will not change.

&gt;The worst part of this is the deep, deep hypocrisy of it. """,0,1414687361,null,0,false,0,cloayez,t3_2krsie,t1_cloayez,t3_2krsie,null,1426272819,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Sorry, but I still love supermarkets. They give you everything, at guaranteed quality, under one roof, for extremely low prices. They open longer hours (sometimes 24 hours!) and always have plenty of staff on so you don't queue for very long. They're amazing.

The idea they're in decline because people are pissed off at their environmental policies and for artificially inflated prices (especially following the recent race for the bottom instigated by Tesco and Morrison's) is laughable. And I'm sorry but:

false,Aardvarkuk,null,null,"&gt;In Britain, harsher sentencing under the Dangerous Drugs Act between 1928 and 1967 kept the number of cannabis arrests to fewer than 1,000 each year. After the effective decriminalisation of cannabis from 1967-1974 arrests rose sharply. The introduction of the 'cannabis warning' by the police in 2004 as a way for them to let people arrested for canal is possession off with nothing saw further increases in the number of arrests, which has only stabalised at 150,000-200,00 in the past few years.

You have lifted most of this from the post above and it isn't going to change my point of view. 

You cannot compare the UK now to the UK 50 years ago, or Japan or Singapore. You aren't going to convince me that enforcing cannabis laws more stringently is the best way to better outcomes for the UK as a whole.

&gt;In Portugal, drug use has risen since decriminalisation. The myth that is hasn't is often twisted to appear factual by using the phrases 'no substantial increase' or 'no significant decrease'

Drug use has increased in Portugal but harm has decreased which is the important thing. Drug use in itself isn't a problem - it's the harm it creates. If there is no or little harm as there isn't with many illegal drugs then why should they be illegal? 

&gt;Because factors other than harm should affect the legality of a substance. One of them is the practicality of banning it. Alcohol is harmful but impractical to ban so it should be legal. Cannabis is harmful and practical to ban so it should be illegal.

I completely disagree that factors other than harm should affect the legality of a substance. Alcohol is much more harmful to the UK as a whole than cannabis. Why is it impractical to ban it? Why should you allow one persons vice and not someone else's?

There are shade of grey here and essentially it is a civil rights issue. Why should the state or anyone else tell a citizen which moderately harmful substances they should or shouldn't put into their body?

&gt;The post is a collection of valid investigations

From the 80's and 90's - better research has been done since taking a more objective look at things bearing in mind the political climate during the time your research was published

&gt;many of which have not been replicated since they were carried out. 

This is also a problem...

&gt;There's plenty of evidence there which isn't promoted because it isn't popular. Studies which are promoted are the ones which appear to verify the fashionable position on cannabis, which is why so many people mistakenly believe that scientific fact (mainstream opinion is often wrong) is on your side. 

Why do you think scientific opinion has come round to this point of view? Because they majority of the evidence suggests cannabis is not nearly as bad as we thought 20 years ago. 

There are studies which support both sides of the argument that's true but I am not arguing for a free for all here. I think we would do better to tax and regulate consumption.

&gt;Dismissing evidence because it contradicts your position is a bad habit to get into. If it's the quantity that's making you doubt it, you can find more

I'm not dismissing anything. A lot of what is said in your link is true no doubt but it's also sensationalised and misleading. Linking me to an anti drugs pressure group website which looks like it has come straight out of 1997 is hardly going to do anything more to convince me either.....

Someone stubborn, earth centric, and close minded.

I like to think that Clara is becoming way too ""doctor-y"" for the doctor. Whyever she leaves, I feel an opposite extreme is needed to balance out the equation.

Donna has the right attitude, but she softened up fairly easily. Danny Pink has the right frame of mind, but is far too nice. I want someone that would make reddit facepalm at how ignorant of the universe they are.

Capaldi has had a bit of a softballed course with Clara on board. Clara embraced adventure, had been with a previous doctor for a season, and was more integrated with the doctor than he even is now. I love how Capaldi has done so far, don't get me wrong, but he needs someone to challenge him. 

I feel like this is why Tennant is so very loved (myself included). 3 seasons and 3 companions each so distinct from one another. It allowed us to give the Doctor depth based on how he interacted with each in turn. 

Rose was the Clara of her doctor, easily embracing the adventurous time traveler lifestyle, sharing the doctor's sense of humor, and generally getting along like a house on fire that was supposed to be on fire the whole time.

Rose left, and 10 was devastated. You could tell WHY he missed her so much; they had wonderful chemistry together as people first, and traveling companions of a time machine second (and both very intensely). Martha was a very good companion, but not a wonderful match for the Doctor as a person. Donna was neither, and allowed the doctor to express himself in a way that contrasted her, even as she softened. It made his slingshot into ""Timelord Victorious"" all the more understandable. Trust me, I love Donna Noble.


Smith went from one ""companion I love and adore but can not have"" to another. We saw his character evolve ONLY as a basis of inside plot points and the way he dealt with situations and past events like the Time War. Amy nor Clara challenged the Doctor very intensely until recently in Clara's case. Its also odd that the more she tells him how terrible he is for doing the things he sometimes does, that she's also picking those things up one episode later. Its part of the reason that with 12, I'd be happy to see that Clara is some kind of trap, clone, Cyberman, dream, zombie, vampire, or whatnot. If there's a reason why she's so flippy sloppy, I'll love Clara for what she is.

&gt;

&gt;Shortly before landing at the [Berlin Tempelhof Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Tempelhof_Airport) in the American sector of Berlin, Halvorsen would drop candy attached to parachutes to children below. This action, which was dubbed __Operation Little Vittles__ and sparked similar efforts by other crews, was the source of the popular name for the pilots — the candy bombers. Halvorsen wanted to help raise the morale of the children during the time of uncertainty and privation.

&gt;Halvorsen started by giving a few treats to children watching the planes from outside the Tempelhof base. Wanting to give more, he promised to drop more candy from his plane the next day. Because the planes would arrive nearly every three minutes, the children naturally couldn't distinguish his aircraft from the others. However, Halvorsen promised to wiggle the wings to identify himself, which led to his nickname ""Onkel Wackelflügel"" (""Uncle Wiggle Wings""). The other American candy bombers became known as the Rosinenbomber (Raisin Bombers). Halvorsen's initiative drew the attention of the operation's commanding officer, Lieutenant General [William H. Tunner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Tunner), who approved of it and ordered it expanded into Operation Little Vittles.

&gt;The operation was soon noticed by the press and gained widespread attention. A wave of public support led to donations which enabled Halvorsen and his crew to drop 850 pounds of candy. By the end of the airlift, around 25 plane crews had dropped 23 tons of chocolate, chewing gum, and other candies over various places in Berlin. The Confectioners Association of America donated large amounts to the effort, and American school children cooperated in attaching the candies to parachutes.

Ah, yes. A PM's *belief* trumps factual findings – and no need to change anything of course, because, to paraphrase Cameron, ""nobody told me specifically what to do"". As if that had ever stopped the Tories w/r/t anything else. And of course if the report *had* contained concrete policy recommendations, Cameron would have attacked it as unscientific and politically biased. Damned if you do, damned if you don't.

*""It’s just for some queen who wants to dress up in a bridal frock and in a big moustache and dance up the aisle to the Village People""* - definitely fits the definition

&gt; There is nothing intrinsically equal or fair about legally allowing gay marriage.

Well there is. Denying anyone the right to marry is an inequality. By doing so you are saying that x group is not equal to y group. And that isn't fair.

&gt; No more than it does with incest or minors.

What is it about gay marriage always lead the anyone anti  to bring up incest and paedophilia? That implies you view homosexuality as disgusting, immoral etc  Allowing gay marriage won't suddenly lead us to legalising paedophilia.

&gt; Because marriage is a religious ceremony that joins together a man and a woman in union for the purpose of procreation.

Well that's up for debate, and as of this year, it doesn't mean that in this country any more.  Society has moved on from such draconian views.

&gt; Gay people have always been free to marry and many have to members of the opposite sex, including having children.

So if gay people want to marry they should renounce their sexuality and marry someone of the opposite sex?

&gt; Finally, a reasoned criticism. The short answer is simply to differentiate between marriage and civil unions. 

Well we should be differentiating. That's the bottom line

&gt; His remarks aren't damaging

Er, yes they are. They may encourage debate, and yes that's good, but they are disparaging remarks, about homosexuals that will damage that community.  The sort of thing discrimination and bullying we have sort to stamp out.  By your logic, we ought to encourage all hate speech or allow terrorists a platform to preach just so we can sit and chat about it afterwards.

No.

Let's say you're given a million pounds and you put it into your savings account. This allows the bank to lend more than that million to people and businesses in the form of loans. Your wealth may be in the bank, but the world's wealth doesn't stop circulating, it isn't dormant.

But what about assets? You buy a million pounds worth of gold bars and pay a small fee to keep them in a bank's safe. The bank can't lend this gold to others, but you paid a million pounds for it. The guy you bought them from now has that money to put in his bank.

Similarly if you buy a property for a million pounds, you might have a million pounds tied up in property, but the world doesn't, the guy you bought the house from has a million pounds to spend on gold bars.

So what about assets that increase in value? Let's say your grandfather bought a house for £10k, and today it's worth a million. Surely the world now has £990k tied up in assets? Fifty years ago the previous owner walked away with only ten thousand pounds for it, but it's worth a million today?

Well, the value of an asset can rise and fall, but it's value is only the price it can be sold for, and until someone sells it, then the price doesn't really matter.

false,houseaddict,null,null,"You know, you make some interesting points and some good questions here and I will do my best to give you a reply that will make you rethink your position a bit.

&gt;What you do to your body affects other people. When many people in a society use drugs there is a collective effect which is beyond each individual's body. No man is an island and people have responsibilities to those around them and those who love them.

Right, I don't agree with you assertion that the collective effect is wholly negative, certainly there are negative effects from pretty much any activity but there are also positive effects. For example, people may be happier having drugs as part of their lives, god knows the middle class would be bloody unhappy without that half bottle of wine after a long day at work. Also, creativity can be stimulated by drugs, all that great music from the past.. made by people on drugs you know.

Now I agree with harm reduction, which is why I believe legalisation is the correct way forward which leads me too...

&gt;That doesn't address the alcohol question at all. Is it a good thing that people become addicted to alcohol? If not what can the law do to avert it in a way that isn't totalitarian? Banning it is impractical. I'm suggesting stricter licensing laws.

Is it a good thing? I think undeniably being dependant on any substance is not exactly a good thing, but then again I am also dependant on food and water. I think the fact is, it is unavoidable, as you say banning it is impractical and I agree, you seem to be a person who knows their history and you will certainly not need me to point out the 1920's prohibition mess in the USA. The point I am making is that it is also impractical to ban drugs, the only example I need to give is to tell you to open your eyes and look around. Drugs are available everywhere and completely unregulated, it is in fact, the exact same situation.

&gt;Then will you answer whether you agree with me that cannabis is effectively decriminalised? 

I don't agree that it is, although it should be. I know people who have been arrested for it, I know people who have criminal records for it, I certainly don't walk about freely carrying the stuff for that very reason. I think this is kind of beside the wider point we are discussing though.

&gt;You are (probably knowingly, which is dishonest) using two different senses of the word stupefy. Sensational media does not directly affect people's brain chemistry; drugs do. I used the point of stupefaction to show how it was different from other liberties, which tend to have the reverse effect.

I know it's easy to think that your debating opponent is being intellectually dishonest, I feel that way myself sometimes but I want to assure you I am debating in good faith and I don't feel the brain chemistry distinction is much of one, although I am pleased that you recognise that the daily mail (and other media) does stupify people. Now I do feel it's really besides the point what effect it has on the individual, they choose it of their own violation (provided we are talking about the 95% of recreation users rather than addicts, they obviously don't have much of a choice). Yes of course drugs have an effect, nobody would take them if they didn't do anything. I could of course say the exact same thing about alcohol or indeed obesity which obviously has a more direct health effect rather than a neurological effect.

edit: I have one question for you which I hope you will address. Would you be in favour of putting alcoholics in prison just for being alcoholics? If not, why not?

Where I think David Coburn is wrong is to take that view and impose it on others who don't agree with him.

I remember watching that Cup game on television you went to and hearing about the windstorm the week or so before that cancelled the Palace match. Too bad 'cause at the time Palace was playing like shit and we could have used the 3 points at the end of the season.

Watched Green Street Hooligans yesterday, not a bad movie. It had a heart despite Elijah Wood who seemed to me as a poor choice for the role, good actor though.  Didn't enjoy the shaky cam either during the rumbles. I really like the West Ham United song, ""I'm forever blowing Bubbles""-- the supporters have turned into an anthem. Makes me wish Everton had a song to rival the Reds, ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" or West Ham's ""Bubbles."" 

I've been reading up on and watching a lot of stuff on Youtube about Hooliganism. The Real Football Factories is okay, I can't stand the presenter much.

Are professors always right? It's absurd because you are comparing the degree of two completely different types of harm. 

As for nut allergies, I see any act of recreational self-stupefaction as a dangerous thing. Even so, the comparison is another physical vs mental one.

 &gt;Secondly, it does make sense, if activity A is more dangerous than activity B then there certainly there is a case for saying, why is one illegal and not the other.

Very simply because factors other than danger - such as the practicality of banning it - should affect a substance's legality.

I thought it was very well-known that these are the characteristics of any habitual drug user. They're not objectively measurable. I doubt you'd ask 'so what' if you were speaking to someone whose family member fitted the description I gave. For them their lives are often ruined by the effect that mind-altering drugs have on their loved ones. I think anti-depressants also do a lot of damage in that respect, as well as their use being disturbingly correlated with suicide and violence.

Personally I can't say it was the case for my school - It didn't seem that way at least. There's also a perception that everyone's well off or outrageously wealthy but most are from fairly average middle class backgrounds. A good number, like myself, are from lower working class backgrounds and were lucky enough to get the chance to go because of our parent's sacrifices and/or scholarships. School's like Eton/Harrow are outliers and very elite by nature and a very small number. School's just below that grade like mine, Hab's, Highgate, and even Dulwich aren't remotely like their student body. 

The last part you mention is still true, but I've never found it to be very common and I don't think it's any where near as prevalent as in the past. We've progressed a lot, albeit until the rising tuition fees. In general no matter your background, if you worked hard at school and attained decent grades you would be afforded the same opportunities.

The good thing however was that they allowed those who achieved good grades to integrate into the BSc without having to start from the 1st year again.

Fast-forward 10 years later I achieved top grades from my undergrad, worked in three different countries, achieved high fluency in two additional languages, created a startup company and was awarded a STEM PhD from a Russell Group University.

&gt;As for nut allergies, I see any act of recreational self-stupefaction as a dangerous thing. Even so, the comparison is another physical vs mental one.

Yes I realise that was a claim to authority, however in this case that authority did undertake a scientific study on the relative harms of each drug. So yeah.. I will accept him as an authority on the matter.

Any act of recreational self stupefaction...? So you are including alcohol in that? Personally, I believed it's an individuals right to do what theyw ant with their own body and if they want to self stupefy then that should be up to them.

&gt;Very simply because factors other than danger - such as the practicality of banning it - should affect a substance's legality.

Aha, an area we agree. As you can see, despite the legal status drugs are everywhere and it is impractical to ban them. Therefore, I can't see any good reason to ban them!

&gt;I thought it was very well-known that these are the characteristics of any habitual drug user. They're not objectively measurable. I doubt you'd ask 'so what' if you were speaking to someone whose family member fitted the description I gave. For them their lives are often ruined by the effect that mind-altering drugs have on their loved ones. I think anti-depressants also do a lot of damage in that respect, as well as their use being disturbingly correlated with suicide and violence. 

Well as a habitual (recreational) drug user I can tell you I do not recognise those characteristics you describe. In fact I think you would be shocked just how normal your average drug user is.

On the subject of anti depressants, yeah some people might have a less desirable result compared to others, is what you are saying that you think that's a good reason to never use them?

&gt;And the best way to stop anybody becoming an addict is to ensure they never take the drug in the first place, which deterrence though the law does and no amount of methadone, medical treatment or 'harm reduction' can do.

Despite societies attempts to prevent people taking them in the first place. We still have addicts, and as the study linked above so clearly points out the legal status makes no difference to drug use levels, so from that I think it's fairly safe to extrapolate that the amount of drug users in a fully legal scenario wouldn't differ greatly compared to an illegal scenario.

British VAT is not progressive for two reasons;

1) What products do and don't have VAT charged on them has been mismanaged for quite a few decades. A common example is womens sanitary products, which are mistakenly labelled as non-essentials

2) VAT is a tax on consumption, rather than income. As a percentage, the poor spend vastly more of their money than the rich do.

What's needed to get to the next level is to be funded like the teams at the next level. There isn't a team in this league who has achieved regular trophies and regular Champions League football without making and spending a lot more money than we have. 

The whole point of Spurs is to place an equal level of importance on winning and playing with style. I think it's silly to say that we don't care about winning. We very much do, as evidenced by the seemingly impossible-to-please WHL faithful. 

The fact is, when it's so abundantly clear that we operate in a different financial stratosphere than even clubs like Arsenal and LFC, some have chosen to be realistic. If more choose to be realistic, maybe the atmosphere around the club will improve.

These schools typically received a charter from the king (I guess that ensured some funding from his purse) which said that the school's purpose was the ""education of the public"".

The establishment of these schools predated widespread schooling - the peasants didn't count and ""had no need"" for education - so the ""pubic"" that these schools were named after meant the sons of the barons.

I'm not sure if they actually charged fees back in those days (I think they were run by monks), but certainly the aristocracy supported them - typically school buildings, libraries and boarding houses might be named after local patrons, such as Anne Boelyn's grandfather. 

With prosperity and population growth in the victorian era, demand for education increased and private schools were opened. I think many grammar schools date from this era, too, and might be some other public-school like categories (""charter"" schools?).

[State schools were established between 1870 and 1902.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-funded_schools_\(England\))

I think all public schools are run on a *not for profit* basis, and I think that public schools are obliged to take anyone (so long as they can pay the fees and, in face of demand, pass the entrance examination) whereas private schools, in theory, can make their own discretion.

Private schools and public schools are both now often referred to under the umbrella of ""independent schools"" - a ""public school"" is supposedly more prestigious than a ""private school"", but in practice there's probably no difference.

The reform that will probably come to English local govt early in the next Parliament (responding to Scot ref and devolution) is an opportunity.
2  More suburban rail lines - I've been arguing for new services on the line between Temple Meads and Parkway, with a station at Ashley Down and also for the line to Portishead and across the north of the city (""Henbury Loop"") ....and these changes will happen in the next few years.  This is down to govt and Network Rail
3  Faster better trains to London and Cardiff - this is happening with the electrification of the main line, should be all done by 2018...I can see the gantries going up around Reading on the train back to Bristol this afternoon.

I love Capaldi and loved Smith as the doctor in their first 13 episodes, but something about the tone of both series feels off to me. They both feel too scattershot, since everyone, actors, writers, audience, are getting a feel for what the new Doctor really is as a character. They're deliberately light on arcs and long-reaching plots because they'd take away from that exploration angle, but those big plots are what made all the ""later"" seasons so good. Like series 4 with everything related to Donna, eventually building to the end of time. 

After so many gigantic (and expensive) episodes, series 5 felt kinda like a letdown, with a smaller, more intimate focus and more randomly dashing about after all those episodes leading up to Tennant's last. Series 8 feels very much the same, after everything with Clara, Trenzalore, the 50th and the 11th Doctor's death. The focus has again become smaller, intimate and significantly less ""epic"" than it was before.

In a way, both series 5 and 8 feel like tv shows that have clearly jumped the shark. **NOT** that Doctor Who has actually done this in my opinion, it's just the feeling I get. The big and memorable stuff happened, and it feels like the show is being forced to continue by corporate decree over any artistic integrity. (Again, I don't feel Doctor Who as a whole has done this, just describing that feeling.)

I am one of the few Who fans in my group of friends who enjoys Capaldi more than Smith or Tennant. The show really needed him and his edge. That's why I'm hopeful series 9 will introduce a seriously awesome plot that will be resolved in a perfectly 12th doctor way. And I'll feel the same way about the first 13 episodes of the next doctor as well.",0,1414694898,null,0,1414695084,0,clof76o,t3_2kt072,t1_clof76o,t3_2kt072,null,1426270828,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

If I were to be particularly impolite, which I now will (my mum continued to live there for many years after I left) I'd say it's brimmed to overfilling with chavs. That's Dartford, not Slade Green.

So I don't know about crime stats in Slade Green, but there's an extremely high level of crime in Erith, which I believe you were also considering.

Slade Green is basically a no-man's-land. So if the crime levels are particularly low, it's not really surprising, because absolutely nothing happens there. Also, it looks really downtrodden and depressing. I would not buy a house in Slade Green and ever expect to make a profit on it. Nor would I expect to be able to survive living there without coming down with at least a moderate level of depression, because it all looks the bloody same, and the same is, well, urgh.

I also think it's highly unlikely that investment money will ever be pumped into the area; the train connections are rubbish (most Dartford services bypass it), and if there is to be investment, it will continue to be in larger places such as Dartford (which does have *one* things going for it; my parents had a fabulous Victorian house on Hawley Road for pretty darned cheap because it was on the outskirts of Dartford).

And they don't offer full seasons to fledging shows any more, that's when they do the testing waters thing/maybe not film everything at once thing.

What errant nonsense. First of all marriage goes back into the pre-history, we've simply no idea about many of the forms it has existed in the assorted tribes and cultures that existed in this land before the historical record. As such you can't say marriage has ""always been a sacred act"" because we simply don't know what marriage was like for most of the time we presume it existed.

That aside your claim marriage has ""always been a sacred act"" isn't even true for the portion of this Islands history that we actually know. For one thing most marriages in the UK today are secular not religious, mine included, my wife and I are both atheists and there was nothing religious or ""sacred"" about our wedding.

If you somehow discount most marriages taking place in modern Britain as somehow not counting it still wouldn't be true to say Marriage has ""always been a sacred act"". For most of ""the last 2000 years"" that you falsely claim the nation has been Christian marriage was largely a matter of local tradition which was by no means unfailingly sacramental. The Church's monopoly on marriage  in England and Wales emerged late on and was ended by the 1836 marriage act, before 1836 couples could escape the church's monopoly imposed by the Clandestine Marriage Act of 1753 simply by going to Scotland where civil marriages still existed.

In NuWho, there often ends up being a reason, but we often don't find that reason out until some while done the line. With Rose, by the end of series 7 it is possible to construct events prior to this meeting which give a very different motivation for the Doctor inviting her to travel.  

Interfering in events - you will soon encounter the idea of ""fixed points in time"", which is often given as the reason that the Doctor will not intervene. This becomes a very prominent plot device for more than one episode. The exact nature of these fixed points is never fully explained, nor how much of human history is covered by them one way or another, but the key point to remember here is that the show is ultimately a childrens show and this is just one of many conceits that you really need to sit back and accept.  

Humans and aliens - The Doctor is very fond of Humans, and certainly does spend a lot of time around them - more so in NuWho than in classic Who, and this does cause some grumbling among fans, since it really is a big universe out there, and not all of it can be full of humans.

The Better Together campaign then never really laid out a practical timetable for further devolution and were happy to roll with the absurd assumptions some Scots formed about the likely timescales involved. 

It left Scottish voters with incredibly unrealistic expectations. **Remember, it's only been 42 days since the fucking referendum**.

Legislation just doesn't get passed in this country (or any comparable Western nation) in that sort of timescale unless it really is a small but incredibly urgent thing.

I genuinely think the Scots will get a transfer of greater powers, and it probably will happen independently of an answer to the West Lothian Question.

So the crack is effectively fracturing from this explosion as it slowly consumes everything. The Doctor closes it by flinging the pandorica into it. Why does this work? Because the Pandorica was designed with keeping what is inside it alive, so it had a ""restoration field"" and by flinging it into the exploding Tardis (The one that is exploding at every moment in time and space) the restoration field is effectively boosted to be happening everywhere. The final slightly odd piece is that the Pandorica contains atoms of the universe as it was from before the universe exploded, and from this you can extrapolate the entire universe (Sort of like cloning from a single cell).

And then boom, restoration field with the knowledge of the universe before explosion being transmitted everywhere by an exploding Tardis - Simple!

It's so funny you think you're so different to ""stereotypical gays"" when in fact the most cliche thing a gay person can do is moan about how every other gay person makes them look bad but they're so much better. 

And no, I'm not a ""flamboyant queen"", I just don't throw other people under the bus and suck up to people and act like I'm ""one of the good ones"". It's pathetic mate, you may as well ooze insecurity 

&gt;Also the ""always-on"" activist types are intensely annoying too because they can never... ever... let anything go.

What have you done to make life better for gay people other than complain about how shit they are and kiss ass?  



Just because you don't relate to ""stereotypical"" gay people doesn't mean you have to throw them under the bus to impress people. You say they make us look bad? I think you make us look way worse.


Here's a question; if internalised homophobia isn't real, **why are you using vague homophobic right wing buzz phrases like ""the rainbow brigade""?**

false,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; gay marriage is far from being some holy grail of equality

That's because gay marriage has nothing to do with equality. Though it has always been an effective political strategy to label something you want as ""equality"" in a false guilt-trip.

Equality is about tolerance and acceptance - but homosexuality and heterosexuality have very different outcomes statistically. To the point where blood donation screening appears very discriminatory because of very real differences in statistical risks between heterosexuals and homosexuals.

Look: I would have been very happy to be tolerant and accepting of homosexuality. But to be told I'm a ""vile homophobe"" for not actively supporting ""gay marriage"" has left me with a very bad taste in my mouth from verbal bullying. The level of hatred has been over the top and I honestly wonder if homosexuals are so insulated from even recent history (where Turing was castrated) that they simply have no idea of what vile homophobia really was.

Instead we've got a group that does nothing but attack, hate, and play the ""equality"" card. Like other unpopular groups we desperately pretend not to be sick of.

I will explain each one (I don't know how to add imgur captions while on mobile) here, starting from the bottom and working up. Read the album description, too. I hope this makes sense and helps! To note, I curl my lashes first, then apply makeup, then touch up the curl after my face is done then add mascara. I'll show you my mascara technique too, as it will just undo all the effort if you add quickie mascara, I'll explain all this when I get to it!

http://imgur.com/a/HYPZE

Image 1: I start with the tips and work my way down to the roots. Curl the tips with eye closed. It helps reach the tips evenly and don't worry if you catch your lower lashes, they've always uncurled pretty quickly with me. When I curl, I ""bounce"", as in I loosen my grip then tighten, in quick succession, but note that I don't actually open the curlers, just alternate pressure.

Image 2: I then bounce inwards toward the roots a millimeter and bounce the grip for a few seconds, eyes still closed. Once I reach my roots I open my eyes to get a better grip of all the lashes, and after bouncing a few seconds I hold the grip tight another few seconds. I then reposition the curlers to grip the outer lashes (moving the center of the curler grip to the outside, it kinda presses into the cheek bone slightly) and the inner (presses into the inner corner beside nose). 

Image 3: See the curl! Do other eye.

Image 4: Putcha makeup onnnnnn!

Image 5: Recurl! I used another set of curlers, just personal preference because I'm weird. Start at the tips, bounce in, the hold the grip for the roots. Just like before.

Image 6: Dis my curls.

Image 7: MASCARAAAAAA! Okay! I will use a combo of two mascaras usually, the thin green for adding length, the chubby green for feathering and volume. My preference again, you can use one :) Here's why I decided to include my mascara routine: if you add too much wet mascara to the middle of the curl, they fall flat (just like when you wet your lashes from washing your face) and then the mascara dries and holds them flat. Then the whole effort of curling so anally is pointless. Feel free to skip, sometimes I just curl my lashes and leave them mascara-less.

Image 8: Close eyes, only mascara the tips. ONLY! And do this in a side to side swishing motion, kinda like vibrating the brush sideways against the tips. LEAVE THIS TO DRY FOR THE LOVE OF GOD! And it doesn't matter if you smudge, you will, and we can just wipe it off the lids later.

Image 9/10: Once dried, move to the middle of the lashes, opening the eye slightly. Swishy swishy, then swish out toward the ends. This should separate the lashes and add volume and length all at the same time. Because the tips had already dried with the curl in place, they won't straighten with this extra layer. Leave to dry again. Then address the roots, swishy swishy and extending out. Blink if you like. Address the outer lashes too, give them extra love and swishing. 

Image 11: DONE. DONE DONE DONE DONE. This whole shebang gets quicker, trust me, and to me, the effort is worth it. I have been complimented many times and asked whether they are false on a good lash day. 

The main points to remember basically is start at the tips and allow to dry in between coats.

You need a TV licence to legally receive television programming as it is being broadcast.
This includes:

* Programs broadcast from outside the united kingdom

* Programs that you are recording when they're being shown for you to watch later

* Things like sky+ where you can pause the live program and watch it later

This does not include:

* Any form of catch up TV (tv shows that are not live), aka on-demand

Live internet streams are a grey area. You definitely need a tv licence to watch live streams on the bbc website but I've no idea if you need one to watch someone's live stream on youtube for something, or of foreign programming (I assume you do for the latter).

If you want to plug your tv into your computer to watch films on an on-demand service like netflix then you **do not** need a tv licence for that purpose, as long as it is not a live transmission then you are fine.

However be aware that the reason they ask you for your postcode when buying a TV is to let tv licencing know. If tv licencing start pestering you because you have no licence then you can tell them that you don't need one and they might just take your word for it and leave you alone (as happened to me). They might ask to come in and inspect this for themselves, you are not obliged to let them in at all but if they see your TV has no aerial plugged into it then that's usually good enough.",0,1414701190,null,0,false,0,cloip7i,t3_2ks0as,t1_cloip7i,t3_2ks0as,null,1426269194,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I don't have many gay friends but the ones I do have absolutely hate queen/camp side of homosexuality. So I wouldn't say he was homophobic just because said something nasty about them

I'm also gay and I don't hate the ""flamboyant"" side of homosexuality, even though I don't relate to it. So I'm afraid you'll need a new excuse 

Your gay friends are Uncle Tom queers; just because a gay person parrots the majority opinion to fit in with them doesn't mean the majority opinion is a rational or respectable one. You can't trust minorities to speak out for their own rights since they are so conditioned to hold themselves back by society 

If you look at various civil rights issues throughout history you'll find many women agreed that they shouldn't have the right to vote and many black people agreed slavery and segregation was best for them and many gay people agreed they shouldn't be allowed to marry: are they correct? No. So you can't trust them. 

Please don't use the self deprivation of ""know your place"" queers to reinforce ""know your place"" attitudes as valid just because a gay person has been conditioned to accept second class treatment as fair and has internalised everything society has said about them as they age. 

Let me guess; your gay friends only like gay people who have zero camp qualities and are exactly like a heterosexual in every way? Sounds familiar, oh yeah, that's the status quo. 

When your whole life hinges on being accepted by straight people and the perpetual fear of marginalisation and rejection for being a minority, you parrot back whatever the popular opinion is to fit in, even if it's totally self deprecating or you have to throw your own people under the bus.

If they're the same why call it something different? The only purpose is to send a message to society and kids that says: gay unions are lesser than hetero unions. It's a way of reinforcing second class citizenship for gay people whilst pretending you're doing a nice thing and you actually respect them. 

It's just insulting, even your post like ""what's the big deal??"" is insulting because you'd NEVER accept second class treatment yourself but expect us to, ad it shows how little you bother to see it from our side and how little you understand about our experience 

If the script was flipped and gay people got
marriage and you had ""civil partnerships"" you'd change your tune. Would you want to introduce your wife as your"" civil partner""? Does that sound romantic to you? Would you like knowing all your friends are getting marriages and you have to stand by yourself in another line? Would you be happy planning other peoples weddings for decades only to have the same people turn round and say you can't share it with them because you don't deserve to share their superior status?

Would you be happy if you asked for the right to marry and people were so reluctant to be associated with and concerned you'd taint it they cooked up some clinical construction as a compromise? 

Try a little empathy. If the script was flipped you would NOT be happy just ""letting it go"" when there are such psychological and sociological ramifications, you would not be happy being offered such an insulting and degrading compromise but you expect us to tolerate it when you would not 

When someone slaps you in the face, I wouldn't tell you to just let it go. I'd tell you to stand up for yourself. 

Why do people just expect gay people to be door mats? Who do you expect us to just accept second class treatment and be happy with it when you would not? It speaks volumes about yourself. It shows on some level you believe we deserve second class treatment because you can't see why we would reject it.

So i had a meeting with our HR director and BossBoss to discuss my reasons for leaving and if there was anything they could do to make me stay 

I'd re-read the newjob advert that i first saw beforehand because i wanted moar ideas, but i had a ton of notes i'd made before anyway.  It was a really friendly meeting, kinda weird cos there's no longer that sort of work seniority barrier there once you are leaving. But it was a nice friendly atmosphere.

We went over reasons i'd decided to leave, if anything could be done to get me to stay etc, about Boss and what things he does badly, and i mentioned he's an awesome senior technical lead, but a sucky manager etc. I tried not to be too harsh, because i have a certain amount of sympathy for his position, but i also made sure to point out what he's useless at (everything staff related), and why (because shiny computers ooohhh) etc. I also went over on call, how i felt it  was a real problem in small teams, and in bigger ones would be easier, and how being paid for it makes you feel much happier about doing it. And i'd had a cunning idea for them to define roles (junior sysadmin, sysadmin, senior, etc), with skills and then plot a progression for people and give them a path to move towards , so people feel like there's promotions and advancement and training to ask for etc.

They both made a ton of notes and said they'd found it really useful, so hopefully it will be helpful for whatever new people we get in. It was about 30 mins which is a good length for meetings without getting bored.

since then, work is quiet - boss keeps being on holiday or working from home, so it's just me in, gets crazy some days, but I tick along. 69 days to go.",0,1414703049,null,0,false,0,clojp5o,t3_2ktb1f,t1_clojp5o,t3_2ktb1f,null,1426268050,1,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,1

It's part of the reason why I was more into the idea of hiring Frank de Boer in the summer.  He's a winner, with a winner's mentality, both as a player and a manager.  He's played for big clubs where expectations are huge, and knows what it takes to win trophies.  Poch's not got that kind of pedigree.  It's one thing to overachieve with a couple of small clubs for a few seasons, it's another to win the league four times in a row.  Poch's not worked with clubs as big as resourced as Ajax, but he's also never worked with clubs with as much pressure and scrutiny on them as Ajax.

I would absolutely love to be wrong here, and I think regardless of whether we finish top or bottom half of the table this season, he should be given more time.

Thanks for taking the time out of your day to reply to my message on Reddit.com. Having been a Redditor for over four years, it still fills me with excitement to get to communicate with such important public figures as yourself. This is yet another example of how IAMAs reach out to the public, and bring democracy into the living room.

I've received many comments in the past few days that resonate with what you've brought up today, and I want to be the first to commit to consider reading your reply some point in future. At Reddit, there are many path-finding initiatives that align with what you've brought up today, and I am certain the work I'm putting in will fast track these efforts in eventually reading your comment.

Needless to say, the past four years have been a busy time for the people that manage my account at Reddit, which is to say just me. I've fought for and won over 21,000 karma points in that time, and with your support I'll be able to shitpost for another four years and take those Internet points even further.

Like you said we dominated Newcastle last year, so it was likely a worse showing even though that doesn't get shown on the table. But I can (and I will!) just as quickly point to Sunderland this season. We came out worse this year, but we played a fantastic game and thoroughly deserved to win.

Arsenal, I already explained, we played a good game. Deserved the tie, I think, even if it was disappointing after scoring first.

Cardiff were relegated last season, of course. They were *the worst* team in the league, and we *barely* squeaked out a win against them. QPR are on their level of effectiveness (and, at the same time, have better players) and we absolutely trounced them.

Some are just garbage, i.e., the Daily Star, Daily Mail, Sun, Mirror. Avoid them.

My honest recommendation, and this is a piece of advice I give to everyone, is try to read *at least two, polar-opposite* newspapers. So perhaps the Times and the Independent (right- and left-wing respectively, but both good quality). I personally read the Guardian and the Economist, because they both have good international sections. 

The Economist is a fantastic newspaper, with a second-to-none international section. So if you only want to read one source of news, this would be my recommendation.

We could have Reus and Sterling on the wings (left wing is reus' main position) as they are both really pacey players
